Nudging the state a step closer to an era of toll roads, Gov. George Deukmejian 
on Friday unveiled plans to allow entrepreneurs to build $2.5 billion worth of 
private expressways around the state, including a 10-mile toll road in southern 
San Diego County leading to the new border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego project was one of four selected in an unprecedented competition 
to see who could best plan, finance, construct and operate their own private 
transportation projects before turning them over to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners in the transportation competition included consortiums planning 
to build two toll roads in Orange County, and a third group that wants to 
construct a toll road in the fast-growing suburban counties east of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The winning San Diego project would take the proposed California 125 south of 
the Sweetwater Reservoir, near California 54, to the new international border 
crossing on Otay Mesa. The 10-mile, four-lane toll road would run through some 
of the most desirable land slated for development in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's desert with scrub brush now," said Bruce E. Podwal, president of 
California Transporation Ventures, the business consortium that proposed the 
toll road. "The developers have all said they would all donate the property 
(for the road) and contribute toward the project." 
</P>
<P>
Podwal said the developers that would benefit from the project include EastLake 
Development, which already has donated land for a year-round Olympic training 
center now under construction by the Lower Otay Lake. Other beneficiaries would 
include San Miguel Partners, McMillan properties and the Baldwin Co., which 
submitted an unsuccessful toll road proposal of its own for the same route. All 
own land in the area that would be served by the toll road, Podwal said. 
</P>
<P>
State transportation officials said Friday that the proposed route would 
accommodate plans for an international airport near the border. Podwal said the 
$400-million road project is scheduled for completion in December 1995 and 
would cost commuters about $1 to use. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian hailed the winners as part of a "historic public-private 
partnership" that would give congestion-weary commuters an alternative to 
traditional freeways. Tolls on the new roads are expected to range from 10 to 
20 cents a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"While privatizing roads is not something totally new in the country, 
California's approach, I believe, is unique," Deukmejian said, trying to make a 
distinction from East Coast toll roads. "Rather than dictating which projects 
should be bid upon, we allowed the private sector the flexibility to go out and 
determine the projects that would best serve the public." 
</P>
<P>
Other winning projects announced Friday: 
</P>
<P>
An 11.2-mile, $700-million elevated expressway to run through the middle of the 
Santa Ana River flood plain in Orange County. The four-lane tollway would link 
Interstate 5 near Anaheim Stadium with California 73 near the John Wayne-Orange 
County Airport. Completion date: 1997. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-mile, $88.3 million toll road along California 91 from Anaheim to the San 
Bernardino County line. Completion date: 1994. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, a $1.2-billion, 40-mile toll road stretching from Sunol 
in Alameda County on the south to Antioch, on the edge of Contra Costa County. 
The toll road would be the first phase of a proposed 85-mile arc through a 
fast-growing suburban corridor that stretches from Oakland to Sacramento. 
Completion: 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Passed over by the state was a proposal to rebuild San Francisco's Embarcadero 
Freeway, damaged in the Oct. 17 earthquake, and two Low Angeles-area entries 
that included plans for a high-speed, high-tech train from Los Angeles 
International Airport to Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans Director Robert K. Best also said that "there are a lot of economic 
incentives" for large landowners near the proposed toll roads to cooperate with 
the projects. He added that he hadn't realized before Friday that the winning 
proposals were in heavily Republican areas. 
</P>
<P>
But the coincidence didn't escape Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who said 
the department's selection of the winning bidders showed "a 
pro-development-at-all-cost attitude. It's a Caltrans giveaway to Republican 
supporters." 
</P>
<P>
Although still facing local environmental review, those private builders 
announced Friday now have the legal authority to begin negotiating details with 
the state. Political opposition to stop them would be an uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
One of the big winners was Texas computer magnate H. Ross Perot, whose 
consortium proposed the Santa Ana River project. James E. Erickson, an attorney 
for the Perot group, said Friday that the consortium now plans to ask 
Disneyland, Anaheim Stadium, large office towers and South Coast Plaza Shopping 
Center to chip in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to tell them, 'If you want to get an off-ramp into your parking 
lot, there's some value here. . . . We may be able to put an off-ramp to your 
parking lot. Do you want to pay for it?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of toll roads, common for a time during California's Gold Rush days, 
has made a comeback in recent years because of increased congestion and a 
shortage of highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Legislature gave grudging approval for three locally 
controlled toll roads to be built in southern Orange County. And, last year, 
Deukmejian won the right to take toll roads statewide in exchange for his 
support for the 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase, approved by voters in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Best said Friday that toll road projects will receive no state or federal 
funding. Although the state could assist by condemning property, he said the 
winning proposals are planned for existing public right-of-way or are in favor 
with neighboring landowners. 
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the toll roads will be deeded over to the state but then leased 
back to their builders, who will have the right to charge tolls for the next 35 
years. Tolls will be set to guarantee a reasonable rate of return and can only 
be changed with state approval, said Best. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the state would bail out any private project that goes broke, 
Deukmejian quipped, "We'll let the next governor worry about that."

MEDICAL WASTE FOUND IN TRASH BRINGS NO ACTION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT WAS TURNED OVER TO THE NAVY, THE 
SOURCE OF THE INFECTIOUS WASTE, INCLUDING AIDS TEST SAMPLES. SO FAR, HOWEVER, 
THE NAVY HAS REMAINED SILENT ABOUT THE EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nearly two months after San Diego County officials discovered a large cache of 
illegally dumped Navy medical waste -- including AIDS blood-test samples -- 
behind a Normal Heights video store, none of the agencies involved in 
investigating the incident revealed the problem to the public or took action 
against those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The Times learned Friday that, on July 20, eight bags marked "BIO-HAZARDOUS 
MATERIAL: CAUTION" were found in a trash bin behind Blockbuster Video in the 
3500 block of El Cajon Boulevard. The translucent, 18-by-24-inch bags contained 
several hundred used syringes, bloody bandages, bacteria cultures, and blood 
samples used for AIDS and venereal disease tests. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the case under investigation," said Linda Miller, spokeswoman for the 
San Diego County district attorney's office and a member of the county's 
Hazardous Waste Task Force. "At the end of the investigation, we turned it over 
to the Navy, expecting them to handle it. The Navy said they were going to 
handle it. I don't know what they've done -- they haven't made any releases to 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the district attorney, working with Naval Investigative Service 
agents, determined that a Navy hospital corpsman put the eight bags of waste 
into the trunk of his car when he found himself locked out of a medical waste 
disposal shed. His wife unwittingly tossed them into the trash bin of the video 
store where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the results of the investigation were turned over to the Navy last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
But the "appropriate (Navy) command" has not yet received the NIS report, said 
Navy spokesman Chief Petty Officer Martin Wicklund. "When it is reviewed by the 
command, the Navy will take appropriate administrative and judicial actions as 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Wicklund declined further comment. NIS officials also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy official, who requested anonymity, said supervising officers will decide 
next week how to handle this case. The Navy officials met several times last 
month as well as this week with the district attorney's office and NIS 
officials, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The cache of medical waste alarmed county health officials because of the 
amount and the infectiousness of the material. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said, "There were potentially infectious items in these bags. We know 
people go through Dumpsters, especially in that area. We are lucky this didn't 
create a serious health problem." 
</P>
<P>
The find was one of the biggest caches of medical waste found in San Diego in 
years, said Gary Stephanie, director of the county's Environmental Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
"This is major," Stephanie said. "If the Navy has all these procedures and 
policies, and if they are not going to be followed, it's real serious. . . . If 
this was a doctor's office, we would have asked the district attorney's office 
to file charges." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said investigators determined that, in July, working at the end of his 
shift, hospital corpsman Wade Bliss was unable to open the locked disposal shed 
used for hazardous medical waste. Bliss loaded the eight bags into his car 
trunk and left them there. His wife Maria, who works at the Blockbuster Video, 
saw the bags and dumped them into the trash bin at her job. 
</P>
<P>
Store manager Steve King recalls finding the bags and being horrified when he 
saw the red and black label: "BIO-HAZARDOUS MATERIAL: CAUTION." King believed 
that they might have contained radioactive material and immediately called the 
Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really nasty stuff," King said. "I may walk down the beach and see 
medical waste, but I don't figure I am going to see it in a trash can." 
</P>
<P>
Bliss, who was unavailable for comment, has not been reprimanded for the 
incident, sources said. Bliss, 24, is attached to the submarine destroyer 
tender Dixon, which would have handled the medical waste not only for itself 
but for several submarines that its crew was repairing. 
</P>
<P>
Several waves of hazardous medical waste have washed ashore in the past year. 
In most cases, officials have been unable to prove whether the waste was dumped 
from Navy ships or, indeed, where it came from. 
</P>
<P>
In May, three atropine injectors traced to a military depot washed ashore. 
Later, syringes, prescription drug vials and intravenous tubing, as well as C 
rations, dotted the shores from Carlsbad to Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
But, in this recent case, officials were able to figure out what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Because Bliss' wife Maria, 21, did not realize the seriousness of her actions, 
the district attorney's office decided not to file charges against her, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the impression this was something which, if it occurred several years 
ago, no one would have raised an eyebrow -- but several years ago, we didn't 
have the requirements for medical waste that we have now," said Cmdr. Steve 
Epstein, a staff judge advocate for the 32nd Street Naval Base who had attended 
a meeting in August about the incident. "We are living in a new age now where 
we have to take care of things, and apparently that was not done." 
</P>
<P>
Store manager King, meanwhile, has begun padlocking his trash bin.

SEWAGE SPILL CLOSES 2 MILES OF BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 2-mile stretch of beach from Ocean Beach to Mission Beach was closed Friday 
and could be shut down for most of the weekend because a corroded pipe burst, 
sending 50,000 gallons of sewage sludge into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches affected are between Del Monte Avenue in Ocean Beach and Ventura 
Place in Mission Beach, right near the Giant Dipper roller coaster, said Lt. 
Charles Wright, a San Diego city lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
The beach area in Ocean Beach is scheduled to be closed until Monday, but 
Mission Beach could reopen as early as this afternoon, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
A hole, 3 inches wide and 8 inches long, sent the treated sewage into the San 
Diego River flood channel, where it flowed into the ocean, said Dan Child, a 
waste-water treatment superintendent with the city's Water Utilities 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The section of pipe that broke was on Sea World Drive on the north side of the 
flood channel. 
</P>
<P>
It is part of an 8-mile-long pipe that carries 800,000 gallons of sewage daily 
from the city's sewage-treatment plant on Point Loma to sludge-drying basins on 
Fiesta Island, Child said. 
</P>
<P>
The first report of the break came in about 8:45 a.m. Pumps were shut down, 
stopping the rush of sewage in about an hour, Child said. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches were closed because the bacteria in the sewage contaminated the 
water, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real way to clean it up," Wright said. "It becomes diluted over 
time in the ocean and the bacteria counts are reduced to the point of not being 
dangerous anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Signs are posted on the beaches warning people to stay out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to becoming sick, people who ignore the signs could be arrested, 
Wright said.

AL MARTINEZ: NOBODY KNOWS HIS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They stood around a white Dodge van on a quiet street called Filmore, talking 
about a hard-working man who'd been shot to death on a smoggy afternoon in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"Why'd he shoot us?" Filmon Hierro was saying, meaning the guy who'd held the 
gun. Hierro was shot too. "We didn't know him, he didn't know us. Why'd he do 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
"He was crazy," Romualdo Campos said. "That's the only reason. Nothing else 
makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
There were maybe a dozen men around the van. Most of them just listened, a few 
offered comments. All mourned the death of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Ramiro Mejia. That's not a name you've likely heard before and 
it's not a name you're likely to hear again. 
</P>
<P>
The story of his death didn't make the paper and it didn't make the 11 o'clock 
news. Ramiro Mejia died pretty much as he'd lived. Anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
The facts are simple. Mejia, 36, and Hierro, 25, had parked the white van on 
Turquoise Street a few miles away from where they lived in a rented house on 
Filmore. 
</P>
<P>
They were preparing to load a hand cart with fresh fruit to sell door to door. 
It was the same street they'd worked one day a week for the last five months, 
and during a lot of other summers before this one. 
</P>
<P>
Hierro was at the wheel of the van. Mejia stood outside on the passenger side, 
looking in. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a guy walked out of his porch across the street, carrying a 
rifle. There was a single shot. Mejia was hit in the head and died almost 
instantly. Hierro caught the same bullet in his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
Then the man went back into his house. He never said a word. 
</P>
<P>
"Find out why it happened," Hierro said to me, his wounded arm in a cast. "Find 
out why the guy hated us. We're not gang, man. We're vendors!" 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about Carlos Gonzalez, 35, who has been arrested for 
investigation of murder. A .30-caliber rifle was recovered from his house. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez calls the shooting an accident. What he was doing with a loaded rifle 
on the porch in the first place hasn't been made clear. Neighbors say he's 
unemployed and never goes anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know that it was an accident," Detective William Guerrero said. "But 
if it was, it's another example of the kind of thing that happens when you 
bring a gun on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"A bullet that's been fired has got to go somewhere. This time it went into the 
head of a guy just trying to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
That's the thing of it. You can't kiss this off as another gang blow-out. Nor 
was it a love triangle, a feud or a clash of macho egos. 
</P>
<P>
Mejia was about as straight a guy as you'd want to meet. He had a wife, Rosa, 
and five children. They live in the little town of San Miguel, southeast of 
Mexico City, where he, himself, lived seven months a year. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the time was spent in L.A. Mejia and Hierro had come here every 
summer for almost 10 years to sell fruit on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
They would hit the produce market at 4 in the morning every day but Sunday to 
buy the fruit they'd peddle that same day along well-defined routes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good fruit," Hierro said proudly. "We never cheated nobody." 
</P>
<P>
They'd each make maybe $25 a day profit. Most of it went to their families in 
Mexico. Hierro has a wife and three children, also in San Miguel. 
</P>
<P>
Life in L.A. wasn't all work. Sometimes the two would sit on the front porch in 
the twilight heat and drink a beer. Mejia would play the guitar and sing. 
Romualdo Campos would come to listen. 
</P>
<P>
Campos went to school with Mejia in San Miguel. They were lifelong friends. 
"There was no one better," he said. "He never made trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"We were going home next Tuesday," Hierro said. "Ramiro called his wife Sunday. 
He was glad the summer was over. He wanted to see his family." He shook his 
head. "Now I will be taking him home in a casket." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the money the men earned will be spent for the coffin, for shipping the 
dead man home, and for the funeral. Despite the hard labor of summer, little 
will remain for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Questions were asked that afternoon on Filmore. Why was the shot fired? Why did 
an inoffensive fruit vendor have to die? Why was there not even a story in the 
paper? Does anyone really care? 
</P>
<P>
That troubles them most. Does anyone care? 
</P>
<P>
We should. Ramiro Mejia's death crosses ethnic lines. He was a husband and a 
father, a simple man who longed for a better life and was willing to work to 
achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
He was you and he was me, and his death should not go unsung.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arraignment of an El Cajon businessman charged with kidnaping for ransom was 
delayed Friday to give the defendant, J.C. Aler, time to complete legal 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Aler is charged with the Tuesday kidnaping of Sarah Zien, the daughter of Jim 
and Lois Zien, who are friends of Aler. 
</P>
<P>
Aler, wearing blue jail clothing, stopped and stared when he entered the 
courtroom Friday and saw Zien and her parents. He took a step backward as if to 
leave, but a deputy marshal directed him to turn around and to face Municipal 
Court Judge Gale Kaneshiro. 
</P>
<P>
Aler's attorney, Jack Phillips, requested and received a continuance until 
Tuesday, saying Aler has to complete legal arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Aler, 55, is being held in County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Aler owns Industrial Plastics &amp; Assembly Corp. on North Magnolia Avenue in 
El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Zien, 26, told police she was kidnapped Tuesday after her abductor told 
that other family members were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
She was handcuffed to a toilet Tuesday night, but on Wednesday persuaded her 
kidnaper to take her to a pharmacy to refill a prescription for a medical 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at the El Cajon drug store assisted Zien in escaping and Aler, who 
was wearing a disguise, was arrested as he left the store. 
</P>
<P>
The parents reportedly received telephone calls asking for a $400,000 ransom in 
exchange for freeing the young woman. No ransom was paid.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man arrested on suspicion of murder early Friday beat a police officer before 
being subdued by her partner, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Pearson, 25, was booked into County Jail on suspicion of murdering 
Kenneth Paul Ruga, 43, a corporate pilot who lived at the apartment complex 
where Pearson was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Ruga was found nude and had been stabbed several times in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson gave this account of the incident: 
</P>
<P>
Officers Catherine Decker, 26, and Joseph Ramos, 31, answered a call of a 
burglary in progress in a third-floor apartment in the 2900 block of Laurel 
Street shortly after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramos covered the outside underneath the balcony, where he saw the suspect 
hiding," Robinson said. "Ramos identified himself and told the guy to stay put, 
but the guy ran to the interior of the apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Decker "had assumed a position near the front door when the guy suddenly burst 
out and began attacking her. She received lacerations to her left eye and she 
radioed for cover, but when Ramos arrived the suspect had escaped," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramos chased him down the stairs and found him hiding under a car in the 
complex parking lot. When Ramos tried to take him into custody, the suspect 
attacked him, but Ramos was able to overcome the resistance," he said.

This is in response to the letter (Sept. 9) by Richard Boyce, stating that 
Israel has "unmitigated gall" in asking for its debt also to be forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
Was it unmitigated gall to bomb the nuclear reactor in Iraq and thus save the 
world from a holocaust in 1990? Who but Israel saved Jordan from invasion by 
Syria or Iraq, warning them that such a step would meet with the Israel Defense 
Force? 
</P>
<P>
Israel's stabilizing influence in the region is priceless.

The horror stories told by Americans coming out of Kuwait pale in comparison 
with the plight of 100,000 refugees starving on the Jordanian desert. Americans 
were there for financial gain, they knew the risks involved. If they are not 
willing to assume responsibility for their own decisions, stay home.

One hundred thousand refugees in Jordan without water and food is a situation 
that should be completely unacceptable to the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that either Kuwait or Saudi Arabia will offer to pay the bill to fly 
those people out. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis stand to gain tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue each 
day because of oil price increases, and Kuwait has the same level of income 
each day from its assets in the West. It would be a wonderful gesture of 
goodwill for them to want to take care of their own problems.

Re: President Bush's speech on the gulf crisis: 
</P>
<P>
This is kinder and gentler? I will not dance to the beat of the (oil) drums of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
A strong support of the blockade should have been sufficient; sending in troops 
was premature and overkill! 
</P>
<P>
Bush's statement that we are in the Persian Gulf to "defend civilized values" 
is ludicrous. We all know why we are there. His vague references to 
conservation were laughable. But I don't think anyone missed his more serious 
intentions -- domestic drilling (watch out, California and Alaska), and a 
"sound" defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
This crisis should force us to focus on our enormous consumption of oil and its 
alternative sources -- not war.

Strictly speaking, the state decision to declare first stage smog alerts 
earlier than they now do is no more a policy change than setting an alarm clock 
for 6 o'clock instead of 7. 
</P>
<P>
But it says a lot about what pollution science taught us and how policy-making 
has matured in the 30 or more years since smog first appeared on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District will not have to change its 
20-year plan for making Southern California's air clean enough to breathe 
without worrying about keeling over. There's virtually no cost involved. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the action by the state Air Resources Board important is that years 
of experimenting have made it clear that it takes less smog to affect people 
who are physically least able to tolerate dirty air than science knew just a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
What else makes it important? Smog districts will give earlier warnings. Young 
children can be gathered into the house earlier; older people can postpone 
walks until the smog lifts. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule will make everyone more aware of smog -- as if in times like these 
we needed that. First alerts are called when ozone reaches 0.20 parts per 
million parts of air and stays that way for an hour. Starting next summer, the 
threshold will drop to 0.15 parts per million. That will mean twice as many 
alerts in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, about four times as many in 
Orange and Riverside counties and 19 times the number in San Diego. Heightened 
smog awareness might lend urgency to the need to clean up the air.

DO'S AND DON'TS OF BUDGETING; 
</P>
<P>
DO STOP PLAYING GAMES; DON'T CUT AIDS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To think -- some Washingtonians complain that they don't have their own 
baseball team. They may not have a ball club, but the current budget 
negotiations prove they sure do have some top-flight game players on Capitol 
Hill. Too bad they're making a game of the budget process. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it seemed that congressional negotiators were edging close to an 
agreement on how to cut $500 billion from the federal deficit over the next 
five years, petty partisan politics surfaced again, threatening the chances of 
negotiating a budget deal that both Democrats and Republicans can live with. 
Without a deal, Congress would, in effect, relinquish its duty to make 
responsible decisions about the federal budget, leaving the budget process to 
the Gramm-Rudman "automatic pilot" approach that would impose unthinking, 
across-the-board cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats began howling that the Republicans were trying to soak the poor 
with taxes while giving tax breaks to the wealthy. The proposal, according to 
an analysis by the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, would lower taxes by 
$2.9 billion for those in the $100,000 to $200,000 bracket, decreasing their 
share of federal taxes from 12.1% to 11.8%; in contrast, the largest tax 
increases would be imposed on earners in the $20,000 to $30,000 bracket, with a 
1.4% increase and the $30,000 to $40,000 bracket, with a 1.2% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans shot back that the Democrats were leaking "garbage" partisan 
propaganda; that plan was days old and greatly distorted, the GOP said. Still, 
the Republicans continue to push for a cut in the capital gains tax in the hope 
of spurring economic growth and more spending cuts. The Democrats push the "tax 
equity" issue -- that poor Americans should not carry an unfair burden of tax 
increases -- and prefer a greater measure of tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
There already exists, as we've said before, the elements of a pragmatic, if not 
ideal, budget solution: Higher income taxes for higher-income Americans, with 
lower taxes on capital gains. Democrats and Republicans must agree on a 
starting point first; then the art will come in the details. 
</P>
<P>
There is one detail that must not be lost amid all this: AIDS funding. Just 
last month, Congress passed legislation that authorized the federal government 
to spend up to $875 million -- for the first time -- for the clinical care of 
AIDS patients. Cities, counties and states have been shouldering the day-to-day 
costs of diagnosis and treatment of the deadly disease that knows no municipal 
boundaries. In Los Angeles, one of 16 cities with the most AIDS cases, the bill 
would mean $13 million a year for five years. In San Diego, it would mean $2.4 
million a year. The Senate Appropriations Committee next week should restore 
funding cuts made by an earlier subcommittee vote. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to spending taxpayer money, yes, prudence must prevail. But the 
careful management and economy that prudence implies also requires that 
government do all that it can to manage -- and prevent -- the spread of a 
killer disease.

VOTERS FACE 28 INITIATIVES IN NOVEMBER

Gov. George Deukmejian is running around the state pitching his pet project of 
putting prison inmates to work in outside industry. He says it's a great way to 
make prisoners productive and also would help in their rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be fooled. 
</P>
<P>
What the Deukmejian proposal (Prop. 139) would really do is put felons in 
direct, unfair competition with the regular work force. Employers would be 
favorably disposed to hire them because of the tax incentives included in this 
measure, not to mention the advantages of having a cheap, submissive labor 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
There's no evidence that this program would save taxpayers a dime. In fact, 
administration and enforcement of the law could be very costly, because each of 
California's 58 counties would be free to devise its own set of rules for using 
and supervising inmate labor. Prisoners would be exploited and workers who 
haven't committed a crime would be severely penalized if this amendment were 
adopted.

The liquor lobby is drunk with power. First, it bullies and bribes our 
spineless state legislators to place its own anemic version of an alcohol tax 
on the ballot (Prop. 126). 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Prop. 134 was qualified the old-fashioned way, by gathering the 
signatures of more than 1,169,000 registered California voters. 
</P>
<P>
Then it dips into its $20-million war chest to finance a media campaign of 
outright lies and distortions. Prop. 134 will take funding from senior 
services? Give me a break! And now, like some barroom brawlers who realize 
they're still losing the fight, the liquor lobby resorts to some real sucker 
punches. Frightened that the truth about Prop. 134 will prevail, it threatens 
to withdraw its megabuck advertising from any media source that dares provide 
Prop. 134 supporters the fair chance to present the facts. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for the booze barons to sober up and smell the coffee. The 
Nickel-A-Drink Initiative would generate desperately needed revenues that would 
be specifically designated for anti-drug and anti-drunk driving enforcement, 
emergency care, community mental-health programs and for innocent victims of 
alcohol abuse.

DEFACEMENT SUIT AGAINST PRIEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent article by Bob Secter ("Priest Fights Liquor, Cigarette Billboards," 
Part A, Aug. 18) calls into question The Times' longstanding policy of printing 
balanced, unbiased news stories. 
</P>
<P>
Secter presents the case of Father Michael Pfleger who will stand trial for 
vandalism and battery. 
</P>
<P>
Father Pfleger has been accused of defacing outdoor signs and throwing paint on 
the owner of a billboard company. 
</P>
<P>
The article cites his actions as "an echo of a civil-rights theme from the days 
of lunch counter sit-ins and bus boycotts." Nonviolent protests of the '60s are 
far from the premeditated defacing of property and battery charges served on 
Father Pfleger. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect for Father Pfleger, the fact that he is charged with 
defacing public property and battery must not be downplayed nor made to seem as 
acceptable behavior. Both cigarettes and alcohol are legal products and 
companies have the right to advertise. One may not use or even like the product 
being advertised, but that doesn't excuse criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Protest is one thing, but extremist activities displayed by Father Pfleger sets 
the wrong kind of example for communities to follow. What has happened to the 
process of negotiation, of sitting down with the involved parties and reaching 
a solution?

BOOK COLLECTING

<P>
As a lifelong bibliophile, I'm delighted to see that news about books is making 
the front page ("The Binding Attraction of Books" by Terry Pristin, Aug. 30). 
</P>
<P>
It is impressive to read all about the prominent people who have taken up book 
collecting as a hobby but there is one element about books that seems to be 
overlooked: It's fun. You don't have to be rich and famous to enjoy books. And 
now that it has become a status symbol to be surrounded by books, I've been 
appalled to see expensive homes decorated with wallpaper with books sketched 
in, instead of real shelves overflowing with books. That's where the fun is!

Wouldn't it be good if everyone who enjoyed the recreational benefits of the 
ocean gave something back, the way a group of divers in South Laguna did last 
weekend? 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people volunteer their time for worthy causes, but it would be nice to 
have more follow the example of 40 divers who regularly enjoy the beauty of 
golden fish and kelp forests off the Orange County coast. They put their dreams 
of underwater explorations aside for a day to explore the junk left by careless 
people along the waterfront, most of it on the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Their booty of beer cans and plastic bags provided ample proof that the acronym 
they selected -- SLOBB -- was aptly chosen. It stands for, Stop Littering Our 
Beaches and Bays, which is good advice for all of us to follow. 
</P>
<P>
The custodial feeling that people have for the waterfront ought to be 
encouraged, so that those who benefit from the ocean give something back. On 
both Pacific and Atlantic coasts in recent years, dedicated groups such as the 
divers in Laguna have been showing the way. As more people enjoy the water, 
there is more and more of a threat posed to the delicate marine environment. 
</P>
<P>
And if we can't participate in an organized cleanup, at least we can pick up 
after ourselves. You didn't have to look hard to find cigarette butts, paper 
cups and other litter on Orange County beaches this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Much is said about the larger threats to the ocean environment, especially 
dramatic oil spills. But the day-in, day-out pollution from littering takes a 
toll on the marine environment, even despite the ocean's capacity for 
regeneration. 
</P>
<P>
Cans, balloons and trash pose a hazard to marine animals. Birds can choke on 
plastic soda can rings disposed of haphazardly along the waterfront. It doesn't 
take a major environmental disaster to alter the marine environment. 
</P>
<P>
Those who brought out rakes and shovels and bags to clean up the environment 
last weekend in South Laguna have shown the way.

ZOLTAN ROZSNYAI, CONDUCTOR, DIES AT 64;

MUSIC: ORCHESTRA LEADER FLED HUNGARY IN 1956 AND LATER BECAME MUSIC DIRECTOR 
FOR THE SAN DIEGO SYMPHONY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zoltan Rozsnyai, United States International University music director and 
conductor of the school's International Orchestra, died in his sleep at his 
home here early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
He was 64; death was attributed to a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Budapest, Hungary, Rozsnyai first came to international attention as 
founder and conductor of the Philharmonia Hungarica in 1956. That was shortly 
after he fled to Austria during Hungary's failed revolution that year. Rozsnyai 
recruited fellow refugees for his orchestra, based in Vienna. The Philharmonia 
Hungarica toured Europe and North America and recorded extensively for the next 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rozsnyai made his U.S. debut in December, 1956, as guest conductor with the 
Minneapolis Symphony. He became an American citizen in 1967, the same year he 
accepted the post of San Diego Symphony music director. Under his leadership, 
the local orchestra achieved full professional status, and he conducted the 
orchestra's first commercial recording on the Vox label. He resigned as music 
director in 1971, citing frustrations over funding and excessive competition 
from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which played several dates a year in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After the San Diego Symphony's executive committee tried to extend his 
retirement date to 1972, many of his musicians threatened to resign, saying 
they lacked confidence in his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Retired violist Joseph Wagner of Chula Vista, who joined the San Diego Symphony 
in 1954, recalled that Rozsnyai "was ambitious in attempting difficult larger 
works and helped the orchestra to grow." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977 he was to found a Golden State Opera company in Los Angeles but the 
project never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1984, Rozsnyai was music director of the Knoxville Symphony, where 
he led the orchestra's participation in the 1982 World's Fair. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he was recruited to develop USIU's International Orchestra, a 50-piece 
ensemble made up of young professional players recruited for a two-year 
graduate program in orchestra performance. Most of the members -- who are not 
paid but receive room and board and earn master's degrees -- have come from the 
People's Republic of China, with a smattering of European and North American 
students filling out their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The International Orchestra made its debut in La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium in 
June, 1987. During the academic year, Rozsnyai led the orchestra in monthly 
concerts in La Jolla, downtown San Diego's Lyceum Theatre and the San Diego 
College Avenue Baptist Church. Among the soloists who played with the 
International Orchestra were Ilse von Alpenheim, Gustavo Romero and Anthony 
Newman, who premiered his piano concerto with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Rozsnyai is survived by his wife, Alyze Dreiling, International Orchestra 
concertmaster, whom he married a year ago. They had one daughter, Alyze 
Francesca. He is also survived by three other daughters, a son and four 
grandchildren from other marriages.

$3 MILLION IS ENOUGH FOR RICKEY HENDERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rickey Henderson has decided to throw a temper tantrum because Lenny Dykstra 
dares to approach him in salary. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey says "he can't fill my shoes, what I do every year." 
</P>
<P>
Might I remind him that as a New York Yankee, he was hitting .247 when he was 
traded to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
He is an outstanding base stealer, period. I am reminded of another base 
stealer, Maury Wills, who decided to use the media as an outlet for his tears, 
and the Dodgers sent him to Montreal.

Henderson is a good ballplayer who ought to thank his lucky stars he gets $3

Thanks to Jim Murray for his "Saliva Test" article on the Andre Agassi 
decision. We all saw and heard what Agassi did and were revolted by the obvious 
fear of the supervisor to throw Agassi out of the tournament. We were all made 
co-defendants of a system that upholds uncontrolled, disgusting behavior for 
the sake of money.

CAN'T UNDERSTAND USC FOOTBALL PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In August, the Times reported that three USC freshman football players have 
been accused of sexually assaulting a female grad student, and that Coach Larry 
Smith had suspended the three players. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the Sept. 11 Times I read that one of the three players was in the 
starting lineup in the season opener against Syracuse, replacing a player who 
was late for a team meal. 
</P>
<P>
I am a die-hard Trojan fan, but I can't support a team that would promote a 
player who is accused of sexually assaulting a woman because they want to 
punish a player who was late for a team meal. Strange priorities at USC.

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Open tennis tournament was entertaining at its best, but the 
magnificent performance of Pete Sampras has served to place a dark cloud on the 
horizon for this and other tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
His awesome serve was so dominant that it could be the forerunner of a trend to 
place too high a dividend on that one facet to the detriment of finesse and 
many other exciting nuances of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps some thought should be given to raising the net a few inches or 
shortening the service area to prevent the power play from making a mockery of 
the game.

I thought football was complicated, but Terry Donahue says it's simple. 
</P>
<P>
I thought UCLA was clobbered by Oklahoma last Saturday because the Bruins were 
outplayed and out-coached. But Donahue informs us it was because of two dropped 
punts. 
</P>
<P>
His genius is being wasted. He should leave the coaching of Bruin football to 
lesser minds and figure out how to ship Medflies to Iraq and how to keep Bert 
Parks out of Atlantic City.

About the only good thing that happened to the UCLA Bruins in their dismal loss 
to Oklahoma was the end of their quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt freshman Tommy Maddox obviously should be that starting quarterback 
for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Should the UCLA coaching brain trust grasp this fact, they will then be able to 
devote their attention to where it is most needed: teaching the offensive line 
to block.

PATRIOTS RUN PAST CRAWFORD;

BIG GAME: PATRICK HENRY RALLIED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FOR A VICTORY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All week, Crawford High prepared to defend against the guy who last year was 
the county's second-best quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Their preparation paid off -- sort of. Friday night, Patrick Henry High senior 
Luke Lowrey threw for only 139 yards, well below his average of 212.6 of a year 
ago and far from the 220 he had in last week's victory over Granite Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But a main factor in Lowrey's total was that Patrick Henry chose to stay on the 
ground most of the game. Though the strategy appeared to be a failure in the 
first half, the Patriots wore down the undermanned Colts in the second half and 
won, 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
"Our motto," Patriot Coach Jerry Varner said, "is the fourth quarter belongs to 
us. If we're in the game going into the fourth quarter, we feel we can beat 
anyone because of our conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the Patriots overcame a 10-7 deficit in the final quarter. They 
tied it with 7:27 remaining when Travis Wilson capped a 12-play, 72-yard drive 
by converting a 26-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Then they relied on some poor play by Crawford, taking over at the Crawford 14 
with 4:10 remaining after a botched punt. 
</P>
<P>
Only three plays later, Lowrey found David Paul in the end zone with an 
eight-yard pass. Patrick Henry led, 16-10. 
</P>
<P>
The final score came as Brent Dulin intercepted a pass from Phil Parker at the 
Colts' 37 and returned it for a touchdown with 10 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Lowrey finished the game with two touchdown throws and 139 yards on 
seven-for-13 passing. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared as though the Patriots would have a big lead at half time, but poor 
play of their own kept them from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Up 7-3 with less than five minutes remaining in the second quarter, Paul 
stepped in front of a pass from Parker at his 45 and returned it to the 
Crawford 48. 
</P>
<P>
But the Patriots could go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Rose sacked Lowrey for a five-yard loss on second and seven, then a blitz 
forced Lowrey into hurrying a screen on third down that fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
After Travis Walker punted the ball out of bounds at the 27, and Crawford's 
William Walker moved it up to the 37 on runs of two and eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
On first and 10 at the 37, Parker then threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to J.J. 
Wadas.

CAMBODIAN TROUPE'S ARTISTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dressed in white and gold, Yim Devy glides away from four women in red toward 
the front of the stage at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum. The sound 
of a wooden xylophone hovers close to her as she rises and sinks on one leg, 
her head nodding delicately, her hands smoothing the air -- palms open, fingers 
curled back in an arc that nearly reaches the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
She is Mera, the Apsara (heavenly dancer) who is the mother of Cambodia and, in 
Devy's performance, she embodies all the majesty and eloquence of a culture 
that has always seemed something of a miracle. Carrying golden branches and 
smiling from the depths of an eternal calm, she soothes the eye and warms the 
heart -- making into an improbable fiction everything we know about killing 
fields, puppet governments and last-chance coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
Later in this program by the Classical Dance Company of Cambodia, Devy appears 
in a one-act, tab version of "The Ramayana," surprising us with the rebellion 
in her portrayal of the abducted, brutalized Sita. However drastic the 
abridgement, and despite vacant, perfunctory performances by some of her 
colleagues, she connects us to the profound feeling of violation in this 
ancient Hindu epic. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Cambodian holocaust becomes a kind of subtext, and we start 
taking this ritualized conflict between good and evil very personally. Consider 
the ending: Rama and Sita standing together with everyone else weeping. No 
spectacle. No reminder that Rama is a god. Just a devastating intimacy -- the 
look of a family reunion after calamity or long separation -- and a feeling of 
sweet relief. 
</P>
<P>
Other ways of presenting "The Ramayana" occur on the six-part Los Angeles 
Festival program. At the start of the evening, for example, we find nine men 
carrying large, intricately incised leather puppets that represent characters 
from the epic. Sometimes the puppets become silhouettes in front of a backlit 
cloth panel, sometimes shadows from behind it. 
</P>
<P>
In this idiom, a story is less told than illustrated by emblematic arrangements 
of the figures -- but the performers do continually enhance the tableaux. 
There's even a battle that begins with puppets being slammed together and then 
develops into a puppetless martial arts duet. 
</P>
<P>
Male and female styles (or realms) of dancing contrast throughout the program 
-- the men's gymnastic combat in "The Battle at Night" versus the women's 
elegant serenity in the ceremonial "Happiness of the Gods," for instance. 
</P>
<P>
In the sacred "Moni Mekhala" duet, however, this contrast becomes a statement 
about forces forever in opposition, as we see an ogre (definitely male, though 
danced by a woman) attempting to seduce and then subdue a goddess. 
</P>
<P>
He fails, through not definitively, and each of their potentially destructive 
skirmishes brings the rain that renews life. Their conflict is a creative act, 
with Cambodian existence depending on it. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, a centuries-old cultural artifact gains new immediacy as artists 
who recently suffered near-extinction now labor to reconstruct a culture that 
takes the most positive view imaginable of eternal war. 
</P>
<P>
A note about the company: This is not the National Dance Company of Cambodia 
but, rather, a troupe from the University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh. Even to a 
non-specialist, the dancers revealed consistent weaknesses in both technique 
(especially problems of balance) and expressivity on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Give them time. Right now, it's their spirit, style and repertory that dazzle 
us -- and, of course, we can't help but see them as freed hostages, frail yet 
incomparably beautiful for surviving so much. They bring us jewels from the 
ashes and we recognize the value of the gift.

BENEFIT USES HOLLYWOOD RESOURCES

<P>
Goldie sings! And Meryl too, a little bit, though you were probably expecting 
that after the big musical finale of "Postcards From the Edge." 
</P>
<P>
Hawn and Streep spoke some too at Thursday night's all-star benefit at the 
Greek Theatre, though not very much specifically about Proposition 128, the 
upcoming state environmental initiative for which the show was ostensibly set 
to raise money and local awareness. Since the evening was also being taped for 
airing on ABC on Wednesday at 10 p.m. (channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) as a 
pro-environment special, where it will be shorn of any specific references to 
the California ballot contest, the tone of the show was less akin to a 
political pep rally and more along the general lines of "The Earth Day Special 
-- Part II." 
</P>
<P>
Among the sponsoring "Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet" were Bette 
Midler, Cher, Olivia Newton-John, Lily Tomlin, Streep and Hawn, with Robin 
Williams as the sole "other" on the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
It was a better night for comedy than music, with Williams' typically 
out-of-hand 20-minute rant -- aimed at Hussein, Helms, Souter and 
right-to-lifers -- the obvious highlight of a middle-of-the-road affair. About 
five-eighths of it was suitable for TV; one of Williams' impressions was of an 
ABC editor frantically at work, and the comedian kept fretting, with some 
palpability, about how the 7-year-old staring at him from the front row was 
throwing him off on the more risque portion of his act ("You're going to go 
through puberty tonight, Tommy," he promised). 
</P>
<P>
The unintentional comedy of Cher's final number was nearly as impressive. 
Though she carried herself with some dignity for most of her five-song set, the 
chuckles started coming during "Fire Down Below" when the diva was joined by 
seven chain-wearing dancers who gyrated, mostly unchoreographed, to what 
sounded like an uproarious parody of a metal guitar solo. Cher fared better 
earlier with "Many Rivers to Cross," a soulful song that doesn't lose its charm 
turned into a showy pop ballad. 
</P>
<P>
Midler and Newton-John were big draws by virtue of the fact that they rarely 
grace a concert stage anymore (Newton-John allowed that it had been eight 
years). Midler, who brought a band, came off best in her old racy "Soph" 
persona with "Pretty Legs and Great Big Knockers," but got the big applause for 
her ballads. Newton-John inevitably looked a little silly singing to 
accompaniment tapes -- especially on "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," from her 
lullaby album. TV's older demo'll love it, though. 
</P>
<P>
Equally mawkish, Hawn recited poetry ("I think that I shall never see . . .") 
and crooned the Muppets' "It's Not Easy Being Green" in a somewhat more assured 
alto than you'd expect (but hold the record contract). Streep followed with a 
good, earnest speech about environmentalism 10 years ago versus now -- it'll be 
remembered far better than her McCartney/Grammy one -- and then was joined by 
the entire company for "What a Wonderful World," to which she and Hawn both 
bravely contributed verses. It's not easy being a green singer.

HANDLING OF POSTER SITUATION WAS TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We at The Works Gallery are appalled by the total lack of vision and courage 
shown by the Orange County Airport Arts Commission and the Airport 
Administration regarding the commissioned poster by artist Jim Morphesis 
("Airport Poster Plan Melts Away, but Not the Art Uproar," Sept. 2.) I am 
horrified by the lack of integrity exemplified by our civic "leaders" in the 
process of effectively censoring a truly beautiful work of art. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the obvious stupidity displayed by the Airport administration in 
censoring a work of art no more "obscene" than any classical Greek or Roman 
work of art, the handling of this situation is a real tragedy. When one 
individual -- (airport commissioner) Robert Cashman -- has the power to 
override an entire committee which voted 9-0 to support the work of art and the 
selected poster, and to make all decisions pertaining to the art collection of 
the airport -- that is a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
When a single Orange County resident can elect himself "tastemaker" for an 
entire community -- after he is quoted in the press as saying, "If they gave us 
Michelangelo's 'David' today, I'd put it in a warehouse . . ." -- that is a 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing for a printer to pull his offer to print a poster he doesn't 
like; this is a free country. But when that printer also is an official on the 
committee deciding the poster's fate -- that is where it gets interesting. This 
conflict of interests is the direct result of poorly handled business planning, 
typical of the entire airport project. How Cashman could turn a unanimous vote 
in support of the poster on Wednesday into a vote of "Gee, I guess it's too 
late to print it now, that's just too bad" 72 hours later, is another example 
of back-room politics and nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
The Morphesis incident is just one more example of the growing atmosphere of 
bureaucratic restraint on the arts being manifested again and again by 
individuals who feel they are qualified to decide for the rest of us what is 
and what isn't good. I feel it is ironic that the image that Cashman found 
offensive was that of Icarus, a man who fancied himself a god and in the effort 
to emulate one caused his own demise. Maybe Robert Cashman has just flown too 
close to the sun.

MEAN TO MACLAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have never liked the term mean-spirited, mostly because I did not quite 
understand it. 
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to Don Shirley's Aug. 30 review of Shirley MacLaine's "Out 
There Tonight," I do now. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his criticism is leveled at the fact that a great deal of the show is 
repetitive of previous shows. Since when is this a sin? Why not repeat proven 
material? 
</P>
<P>
Also, what about those of us who have not seen MacLaine previously? Are we to 
be discouraged because Don Shirley has?

'BLUE METEORITE' OFFERS A STYLIZED TWIST ON BUTOH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fey, virtuosic, arduous,dreamily high-flown, coldly task-oriented, deliberately 
derivative and too self-consciously arty for its own good, "Blue Meteorite" 
supposedly represents the flip side of the astringent Japanese dance style 
known as butoh. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong piece by Saburo Teshigawara, performed at the Japan America 
Theatre on Thursday night, features the choreographer and three members of his 
company, Karas, moving in a dreamscape furnished with a blue-painted wall, a 
facing wall of glass panes and a rug of glass shards. 
</P>
<P>
The manner of moving is a wonder to behold. Teshigawara -- in whiteface, a 
white shirt, pants and black jazz shoes -- keeps his legs in a perpetual state 
of turned-in, soft-kneed, weighted flexibility so that his upper torso can 
pivot and slide in seemingly any direction, even when he is on half-toe. The 
effect is almost as if he were able to rotate his body inside his skin. 
</P>
<P>
He tilts; his arms slice the air; he falls; he recovers with the automatic 
precision of an android -- and he falls and falls again. His face is frozen in 
distress as he executes his puppetlike routines to an uncredited sound score 
that begins quietly with small purrs and low machine sounds and swells to a 
stern tattoo of drums. 
</P>
<P>
Kei Kei Miyata, Shun Ito and Koichi Ienaga observe all this from their slumped 
positions within individual ceremonial frames. Eventually they embark on a 
rhythmically varied, punishing set of perfect falls and automatic recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
Teshigawara becomes a latter-day incarnation of Nijinsky's Faun -- to the taped 
accompaniment of Debussy's "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun" -- as he 
stretches and balances on the glass shards. Seeing his reflection, he twitches 
with animal pleasure and reproduces the bolt upright seated posture and 
mittenlike gesture of the original choreography. 
</P>
<P>
The program statement says the glass is a symbol of "crystals of light and 
fragments of time." But while the faun experiences disembodied bliss, the 
audience feels empathetic pain for a real dancer lying on sharp glass, giving 
the proceedings an ever-so-controlled aura of masochism. 
</P>
<P>
Teshigawara's transformation from man to spirit is now complete. He flutters 
and jumps and flashes his faun-hands, joins in a stomping line dance with the 
others and flirts with the wall of glass. At the end, he makes tiny, 
nearsighted writing motions in the air. 
</P>
<P>
The gesture recalls the crabbed movements of butoh -- as if, in his white-light 
ecstasy, Teshigawara is honoring the older dance form. But his version is a 
postmodern mutant -- coolly appropriating famous choreography and organizing 
co-performers into a robotic, backup-dancer look not far removed from pop music 
video. A technically brilliant, fine-tuned glibness has replaced the flinty 
power of butoh. 
</P>
<P>
Performances continue through Sunday.

SALUTE CAPTURES ENERGY OF FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Salute to the Los Angeles Festival" at the Hollywood Bowl Thursday evening 
proved in many ways a paradigm for the festival, of which it was a part. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere of a silent color film by festival director Peter Sellars, 
updating "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" and inspired by John Adams' 
"Harmonielehre," dropped off the program almost as soon as it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
As a replacement, Sellars served up the original silent classic, and preserved 
"Harmonielehre" -- played by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by David 
Alan Miller -- as the accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Through the drastic, musically destructive expedient of repeating the first 
movement of "Harmonielehre" between the second and third, Sellars made sight 
and sound fit, at least loosely. He also had to tinker with the pacing of the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
The music, however, suffered. German Expressionism is the tie that binds here, 
but reduction to accompaniment brought the mechanistic elements in 
"Harmonielehre" to the fore, and the radical restructuring made no more sense 
than would repeating the first movement of the "Eroica," for example, after the 
Funeral March. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Co. did not advance the cause with their often imprecise 
performance. Brass and percussion parts came through with pertinent vigor, but 
many of the strings seemed to settle for rough approximations. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Academia-Magda's explanation of the ensemble from her World Kulintang 
Institute touched on some of the same ideas that Adams expressed in the printed 
program, and the music had clear links to minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member ensemble from the Reseda-based institute gave a lively, 
awkwardly amplified introduction to the kulintang, sort of a Philippine 
gamelan. Like gamelan, the kulintang seems to have two primary, intervallicaly 
spicy melodic modes, each requiring a different set of gongs. The short, 
unannounced pieces on this survey were largely up-tempo numbers, delivered in 
keenly articulated rhythmic layers with flair and precision. 
</P>
<P>
With a traditionally oriented and carefully paced powerhouse gospel set, the 
F.A.M.E. Freedom Choir gave yet another dimension to harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Joe Westmoreland -- with the spirited assistance of Rickey Grundy and 
Charles May, and a dynamic, often incomprehensible set of soloists featuring 
the fiercely soaring male soprano of Dwayne Knox -- the chorus provided full, 
unfettered vocalism.

<P>
Director Arturo Ripstein's tale -- from a Juan Rulfo story -- shows a truly 
horrifying rise, decline and fall: a sentimental, bumbling, childishly selfish 
town crier becomes a swaggering cockfighter, seducer and high-stakes gambler. 
But his wealth proves more squalid than his poverty. . . . Ripstein, with 
corrosive cunning, traps his protagonist in a quagmire of fetid success, a 
no-exit of splendid misery. The movie has a hypnotic rhythm, wonderfully seedy 
decor, and a crazy fairy-tale inevitability; some of Ripstein's jokes are as 
savage as Bunuel's. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

MYSTERY WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two-and-a-half years ago, we went to the Los Angeles Opera's "Tristan &amp; 
Isolde." We were late in ordering our tickets and so wound up in row U at the 
leftmost edge. 
</P>
<P>
In an orchestral passage of the first act, an elderly lady of aristocratic mien 
got up from the middle of row U and edged her way out, murmuring apologies on 
the way. Near the end of the intermission, she asked us whether we would 
exchange our seats with those of her and her companion (a younger woman). We 
replied that of course, we would be glad to do so, but that one couldn't see 
the subtitles from our seats because of the balcony overhang. Whereupon she 
replied that she did not need to see them: She knew the opera by heart, having 
sung it at Covent Garden. Her problem was that, in subconsciously vocalizing 
with the soprano, she built up a need to cough. 
</P>
<P>
We were of course quite overwhelmed by this explanation but lacked the presence 
of mind to ask her name. Do you have any idea who she was?

WHY NOT A PLAZA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article regarding the Laguna Beach municipal art project under the Arts in 
Public Places program ("Can Laguna Beach Commission a Worthy Sculpture for 
$27,000?" by Cathy Curtis, Calendar Aug. 20) has no doubt illicited many 
responses. I certainly have been hearing them. . . . I would like to share with 
you and your readers a slightly more productive and positive response which, 
hopefully, could improve the process of developing this particular and future 
municipal art decisions. 
</P>
<P>
While I agree with you that $27,000 is a modest (you said "paltry") amount, a 
greater insult is the designated site and lobbying by several councilmen for 
"the kind of art they'd like to see" . . . traditional, in keeping with the 
architecture (Spanish colonial). 
</P>
<P>
All this is rectifiable by reconsidering the present site (and) creating a 
downtown municipal plaza of the street (Loma) that connects the city's 
administrative office building with the Laguna Beach County Water District 
(also recently remodeled). Such a change would offer infusion of additional 
funds toward a total site development: Funds scheduled for paving, curb, 
gutter/drainage, lighting, etc. could recombine and support a plaza format for 
a work of art. This format would assuage those who are entrenched in having the 
site become thematic. What could be more in keeping with the architecture and 
the "Village Laguna" theme than a plaza? 
</P>
<P>
An important factor in all of this would be the integration of all municipal 
services, the use of the plaza for city staff and the public, for official and 
non-official events, for assigning a sense of place to the administrative 
buildings for the city, to bring together the three-way traffic points into a 
very visible and functional arena that gives more than lip service to Laguna's 
desire to be perceived as vanguard in its securing of open spaces for future 
generations and its commitment to its artists and art. In no way would the 
plaza eliminate all vehicular emergency access; its paving and design, though 
re-formed to support and extend itself for pedestrian use, would allow 
necessary use by police, fire and utility equipment. 
</P>
<P>
What has been proposed is a reasonable solution that may open other areas for 
municipal development with art incorporated into the initial planning, rather 
than an afterthought.

</P>

GULF CRISIS: AMERICAN DIPLOMAT WAS QUESTIONED WHEN FRENCH, CANADIAN AND BELGIAN 
DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS WERE INVADED. PRESIDENT BUSH HINTS AT POSSIBLE U.S. 
RESPONSE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi soldiers stormed the French, Canadian and Belgian diplomatic quarters in 
Kuwait on Friday, briefly detaining a U.S. consul and several other diplomats. 
President Bush declared the crackdown "outrageous" and hinted at a possible 
U.S. response. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi troops held five Western consuls for several hours and arrested 
French citizens as the occupying forces stepped up the pressure on holdout 
embassies to close their doors in Kuwait city. The U.S. Embassy was not 
involved in the incidents, but the U.S. consul from Baghdad was detained while 
visiting at the Canadian ambassador's quarters. 
</P>
<P>
In a stern warning, Bush said he drew no distinction between the raids on the 
embassies of American allies and an attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents "underscore the brutal behavior of Iraq" and "add up to clear 
violations of international law," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
"They do raise tensions; they clearly do," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The escalation of the six-week-old confrontation interrupted a brief lull 
marked by diplomatic efforts by both sides to gather allies. It was the first 
time that foreign diplomatic compounds in Kuwait had been forcibly entered, 
although they have been under siege and denied supplies for a month. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi raids on foreign compounds appeared to be coordinated and aimed at 
breaking the will of Western diplomats to hold out amid worsening conditions. 
The U.S. and major European embassies have been denied water and electricity 
supplies for three weeks, and Iraqi troops stationed outside their walls have 
prevented anyone from entering or leaving. 
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry officials in Paris said Iraqi soldiers forced their way 
into the ambassador's residence at 7 a.m., taking the military attache, Col. 
Edouard Crespin, and three French civilians to an undisclosed location. Crespin 
was later released, but the whereabouts of the civilians were not known, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador was out of the country when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and 
the embassy has been under the command of the charge d'affaires. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand, whose country was the main Western arms 
supplier to Baghdad during Iraq's 1980-88 war with Iran, called the Iraqi raid 
"aggression." Speaking with reporters in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, during a 
state visit, he vowed: "We will respond to it." 
</P>
<P>
French officials said the government would announce its response after an 
emergency Cabinet meeting today in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
At the Canadian ambassador's residence in Kuwait, Iraqi troops forced their way 
in before dawn, according to a Canadian diplomat in Paris. The troops detained 
the Canadian consul and his counterparts from the United States, Ireland, 
Britain and Australia, along with six Irish private citizens who had taken 
refuge there. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government said the officials were released two hours later, after 
their identities as diplomats stationed in Baghdad were established. However, 
there was no word about the fate of the Irish citizens. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said the U.S. consul, whom they refused to identify, 
had visited Kuwait frequently in recent days to arrange flights home for 
American women and children. About eight Kuwait-based American diplomats, 
including Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell III, remain confined to the embassy 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disruption, another flight left Kuwait on Friday, carrying about 
300 American women and children aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways 747 jumbo 
jet. The group was expected to reach the United States today. A U.S. Embassy 
official in Baghdad said about 1,500 Americans remain trapped in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In the third incident, Belgian officials said three Iraqi soldiers entered 
Brussels' diplomatic compound and tried to force its two remaining 
representatives to abandon the embassy. The diplomats fled into the 
ambassador's residence adjoining the embassy building. 
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands, meanwhile, the government disclosed that Iraqi troops had 
forced their way into the home of its ambassador to Kuwait, Joop Veling, 
earlier this week. No details were available. 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi news agency in Baghdad denied the reports without further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Razzak el Hashimi was summoned to the ministry 
to explain the incidents in Kuwait. He denied that the 1961 Vienna Convention, 
governing diplomatic relations, had been violated. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no government of Kuwait," Razzak said. "There is no state of Kuwait. 
So the Vienna Convention does not apply. . . . These people in Kuwait are no 
longer diplomats because there are no longer embassies there." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after invading Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein's regime ordered the 
more than 60 foreign embassies there to shut down by Aug. 24 and to move their 
staffs to Baghdad. Iraq insists that Kuwait no longer exists as a sovereign 
state, that it is now Iraq's 19th province and that all diplomatic 
representation must be based in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In the month since the order was issued, more than 40 countries have complied, 
almost all under protest. The U.S. Embassy and 16 others are continuing to 
resist Iraqi pressure despite meager supplies of food and water. At last 
report, U.S. Ambassador Howell and nine of his officers were holding out by 
drinking purified water from the embassy swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent embassy to give up was that of Egypt, two days ago. Like other 
nations that have withdrawn their diplomats from Kuwait, Egypt has said the 
embassy remained operational in principle and that Cairo still recognizes 
Kuwait as an independent country. 
</P>
<P>
From Washington, Bush spoke by telephone with Mitterrand. The President said he 
told Mitterrand the matter is "of grave concern" and promised to support 
whatever action the French president takes. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the raids on the embassies would prompt an escalation, Bush said: 
"When an escalation is required from me, Saddam Hussein will know it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not rattling sabers. . . . When I rattle a saber, the man will know it," 
the President added. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher denounced the Iraqi 
intrusions as "another example of Iraq's blatant disregard" of a U.N. Security 
Council resolution instructing Iraq to respect diplomatic missions in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Friday's incidents were "only the latest in what is a 
growing number of violations of diplomatic missions in Kuwait by Iraqi 
occupation forces." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Iraq, John Wilson, had 
protested the incident to the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in London, British Deputy Foreign Secretary William Waldegrave said 
angrily: "It's another fairly grave threat. It's consistent with the illegal 
position the Iraqis have taken throughout." 
</P>
<P>
But he said it was not clear whether the Iraqi troops involved were renegades 
or were acting on instructions. He said the nations of the European Community 
have all agreed to assume responsibility for each other's nationals if it comes 
to the point that their embassies can no longer hold out. 
</P>
<P>
By moving against the French, the Iraqis attacked a potential moderating force 
in the gulf conflict. Although the French military deployment is the 
second-largest in the region after America's, France has opposed offensive 
military action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraq is known to feel betrayed by France, which was an important weapons 
supplier during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran. In much the same way that the 
United States once depended on Iran as a crucial anchor in the Middle East, 
France depended on Iraq. The relationship began to fade after Iraq fell behind 
in payments on $4.5 billion it owed France, mostly for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview on French television, Hussein was sharply critical of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
"The only blame we have is against France," he said. "We don't directly blame 
the United States or Great Britain because they were never objective. They were 
never our friends."

ALLIED FRIGATES FIRE WARNING AT IRAQI TANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
U.S. and Australian warships fired across the bow of an Iraqi oil tanker in the 
Gulf of Oman on Friday and then boarded the vessel in an incident that ended a 
monthlong cease-fire in the sea blockade and raised prospects for new 
hostilities in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation came after the Iraq-bound tanker, in a sharp departure after 
weeks of Iraqi cooperation, ignored repeated demands that it halt and submit to 
a search, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
After machine-gun warning shots were fired by the two ships, a joint American 
and Australian naval party boarded the tanker and found that it was empty. The 
tanker was permitted to continue toward Iraq in a peaceful end to the four-hour 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the United States has turned its naval guns against Iraqi 
traffic since Aug. 18. Some officials described the incident as a troubling 
indication that Iraq may have decided to mount a new challenge to the naval 
blockade. 
</P>
<P>
"We were making a point, and a rather eloquent one," a Navy official said. 
</P>
<P>
The joint action at sea came as the State Department raised new concern about 
Iraqi terrorism, warning specifically for the first time that Iraq might use 
"its own intelligence apparatus to undertake terrorist operations." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United States accused Iraq of attempting to "create 
conditions of famine" for foreigners trapped in Iraq and occupied Kuwait. And 
the White House, despite new pledges of assistance from U.S. allies, asked 
Congress for $1.9 billion to fund Operation Desert Shield through the end of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the additional spending is 
necessary even with the new burden-sharing arrangements in order "to fulfill 
America's leadership role." 
</P>
<P>
The clash in the Gulf of Oman late Friday afternoon marked the first time that 
an Australian or other non-American vessel had fired warning shots since 
Western warships began to enforce the U.N.-mandated blockade Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Although the incident was the third such shooting by U.S. vessels, it marked 
only the second time that the United States has boarded an Iraqi vessel during 
the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said they were concerned that the show of defiance by the 
Iraqi vessel Al-Fao might mark an end to the peaceful period. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the 800-foot Iraqi tanker, intercepted near the middle of the 
Gulf of Oman by the U.S. Navy frigate Brewton and the Royal Australian Navy 
frigate Darwin, reported that it was bound for the Iraqi port of Basra and was 
carrying no cargo. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon said the Iraqi captain "refused repeated requests to halt." It 
also said that the Navy vessel, after "several requests to permit boarding," 
fired warning shots from a .50-caliber machine gun at about 4:40 p.m. local 
time. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, according to the brief Pentagon statement, the 
Australian frigate fired a second round of warning shots, also from a 
.50-caliber machine gun. The master of the Al-Fao then announced that he was 
stopping his ship. 
</P>
<P>
A team of U.S. and Australian sailors spent about three hours searching the 
vessel to determine whether it was carrying goods to Iraq in violation of the 
economic sanctions. After the "coordinated investigation," however, the 
boarding party determined that the ship carried no prohibited cargo. 
</P>
<P>
In the early weeks of the crisis, the Al-Fao had unsuccessfully attempted to 
dock and load at the terminus of an Iraqi oil pipeline at Saudi Arabia's Red 
Sea port of Muajjiz. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, asked about the incident as he left the White House to begin a 
weekend visit to Camp David, Md., noted that the American vessel was acting "in 
accordance with the United Nations sanctions" in ordering the ship to "heave 
to." 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the Iraqi ship "did require a bit of a warning before the 
captain pulled over and permitted the boarding party to have a look." 
</P>
<P>
Military officials in Washington said they did not know how long the Navy 
frigate waited before deciding to fire warning shots at the Iraqi vessel. They 
also said no information was available about the actual number of shots fired, 
although one source said that "once you open up with a machine gun, it gets 
difficult to count." 
</P>
<P>
The officials, however, played down the confrontational nature of the incident. 
"You're not going to do any damage to a supertanker with a .50-caliber machine 
gun," said a Pentagon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The incident came nearly a month after U.S. warships fired warning shots across 
the bows of two Iraqi oil tankers heading out of the Persian Gulf on Aug. 18. 
The two vessels ignored the warnings and continued on their way, and the Navy 
took no further action. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects for another clash appeared to increase later in the month after 
the United Nations authorized the use of force to maintain the quarantine 
around Iraq, and the United States made clear that it would halt any vessel 
that sought to evade the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
But intelligence reports indicated that Iraq ordered its captains not to 
challenge the Western navies, and apparently only the cargo ship Zanubia, 
boarded Sept. 4 in the Gulf of Oman, sought to enter an Iraqi port. 
</P>
<P>
That vessel, loaded with tea from Sri Lanka, was diverted to Oman and then 
released Sept. 5 with a warning not to continue toward Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The joint operation against the Al-Fao came as the United States won more 
pledges of support from key allies of troops, tanks, planes, warships and cash 
for the U.S.-led gulf buildup. 
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed gratitude for what he called a "significant contribution" from 
Japan, which increased its pledge of assistance from $1 billion to $4 billion. 
At the same time, the President told reporters that he had given his personal 
thanks to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for a new British commitment of 
6,000 ground troops with expertise in desert warfare. 
</P>
<P>
The President described the assistance as "icing on the cake" that will be in 
addition to assistance already provided by Britain -- "a significant move by 
the Brits." 
</P>
<P>
In asking Congress for $1.9 billion in supplemental funding in the next month, 
the Administration injected a blunt reminder of the domestic costs of its 
military operation after days of emphasis on the new commitments by allies. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Administration officials traveling with Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III had suggested that contributions from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other 
gulf states would alone be sufficient to cover the entire cost of the operation 
until the 1990 fiscal year ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
But a White House official said the Administration had always planned for the 
United States to shoulder a significant share of the cost, particularly in the 
initial phases of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
In its new statement on terrorism, the State Department confirmed that its 
top-ranking officer in Baghdad this week warned the Iraqi government against 
sponsoring "terrorist" operations. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the step was taken in part because of 
increasing fears that Iraqi intelligence organizations might be used to attack 
Western interests or mount operations against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary source of concern must be that Iraq might use its own intelligence 
apparatus to undertake terrorist operations," Boucher told a news briefing in 
the first official warning about direct Iraqi government involvement in 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, who demanded anonymity, have said in recent days that 
intelligence reports indicated that Iraqi diplomats in Europe and the Middle 
East may be conducting "surveillance" in preparation for possible terrorist 
attacks.

THOUSANDS ENLIST IN SAUDI FORCES; SIZE COULD DOUBLE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of men have flocked to military recruiting centers over the 
past two weeks in a major public mobilization that could eventually double the 
size of Saudi Arabia's armed forces and place at least six new divisions along 
its most vulnerable borders. 
</P>
<P>
The recruitment effort comes amid controversy within King Fahd's government and 
widespread public dissatisfaction over Saudi Arabia's historic reliance on a 
relatively small army paired with a well-equipped, technologically 
sophisticated air force -- a combination that proved alarmingly inadequate when 
170,000 Iraqi troops threatened the kingdom on its northern border with Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials have sketched a new political map of the troubled Persian 
Gulf region that now shows potentially hostile frontiers not only with Iraq but 
with Jordan and Yemen as well. Moreover, they see the kingdom facing a 
1-million-strong Iraqi army that must be countered not only with sophisticated 
jet fighters, the flashy mainstays of the Saudi military, but also with 
infantry and tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, senior officials and outside military advisers have 
begun discussing a military buildup that would triple the size of the 
37,500-member army and give Saudi Arabia an overall force of at least 120,000 
men -- nearly twice the 67,500 men now in the field with the army, the national 
guard and the air force. 
</P>
<P>
Some consultants are calling for an armed force as large as 300,000 men, with 
new divisions deployed to counteract potential threats from Yemen and Jordan, 
both of which have provided some backing to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 
the conflict over Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in times when anything can happen," one Saudi official said. 
"People are saying, 'We spent billions of dollars building this whole country 
up, and now we can't defend it? What is this" 
</P>
<P>
Controversy within the Arab world over the deployment of U.S. forces in the 
kingdom also has pointed up potential weaknesses in the Saudis' quiet 
confidence that the United States, Canada, Western Europe and other nations 
dependent on Saudi oil could be counted on to send troops in the event of 
trouble -- an unwritten pact that has guided Saudi military policy to a 
surprising degree in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Saudis are suspicious of foreigners," a Western diplomat said, "and 
they're very suspicious of foreigners in their country with lots of weapons, 
and they're especially worried about a large American force that is growing 
stronger every day in an area that is most vital to them -- the eastern oil 
fields." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia found itself without a single complete division when Iraq began 
massing troops on the Saudi border after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of three divisions, or about 36,000 men, at Hafr al Baten, Saudi 
Arabia's northern military base, would have been enough to counter Iraq's 
initial movement of seven divisions into southern Kuwait, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have taken Saddam Hussein nine divisions to give us a good fight," 
one said. "It would have meant we could have probably held him off for weeks, 
if not more, instead of this situation where we found ourselves with absolutely 
no defense against him." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's military policy grew out of a decision at the beginning of the 
historic oil boom to spend the bonanza on developing the kingdom, rather than 
building a large army. 
</P>
<P>
The thinking at the time, according to Saudi officials, academics and outside 
analysts, was that Yemen and South Yemen provided the only credible border 
threats, and those, before unification, were negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Iran grew into a menace after its Islamic revolution in 1979, and Iraq had 
hinted on occasion that it had designs on the kingdom. The ill-fated solution 
to both problems was to spend billions arming Iraq as an ally against Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a secret that there was a debate in Saudi Arabia about the 
size of the army, and many people felt we should have a much larger army than 
we ended up with," said Dr. Bakr Abdullah Bakr, rector of King Fahd University 
of Petroleum and Minerals and one of the most influential personalities in 
Saudi Arabia's powerful Eastern province. 
</P>
<P>
"Some said we are surrounded by friendly nations, and there are more important 
things to spend our money on than building up a massive war machine. I think 
this argument has won in the past, but I'm not sure it will in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia spent $536 billion between 1975 and 1985 building an elaborate 
array of highways, airports, universities, skyscrapers, industrial facilities 
and communications systems. And while it put large outlays into equipping an 
air force rivaling most others in the world, the number of ground forces was 
kept relatively small -- much smaller than the armies of nearby countries in 
the region, Israel, Egypt, Syria, Iran and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Some outside analysts say Saudi monarchs deliberately kept the army small and 
separate from the national guard, which reports directly to the crown prince, 
to avoid potential military threats to the monarchy. One Saudi official said 
that was indeed a factor in keeping the two forces divided through the 1960s, 
but he and several other officials denied that it played any role in 
present-day decision making. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Saudi Arabia wagered that it would be able to counter most 
likely outside threats by building a series of large military facilities in the 
north, south and east of the kingdom from which a well-equipped air force could 
be deployed, depending on the direction of the threat. 
</P>
<P>
A key part of the strategy was an unwritten expectation that outside forces, 
particularly U.S. forces, could be called on in the event of major trouble. To 
accommodate outside help, huge military cities at Hafr al Baten and in the 
Eastern province were built far larger than would ever be needed by Saudi 
forces alone, several analysts said. And the Saudis over the years developed a 
quiet strategy of acquiring U.S. military equipment, spare parts and training 
that, according to one U.S. official, has made the armed forces of the two 
countries virtually "interoperable." 
</P>
<P>
"We always knew our friends in the United States would help us," a Saudi 
official said. "The only question was when, and how fast. Now we know." 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat equated the Saudi expectations with the kingdom's huge 
importation of foreign labor to handle many high-tech jobs and do much of the 
manual labor for which it is difficult to recruit Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis have always done that," he said. "They just buy people. The whole 
country is made up of slaves." 
</P>
<P>
But Saudi officials bristle at any suggestion that the multinational force now 
deployed in the Saudi desert consists of hired hands. One government official 
said Saudi Arabia was willing to finance a large portion of the U.S. military 
deployment from the beginning but was slow about offering direct payments to 
avoid the perception that the Americans were being bought. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans don't like to be thought of as mercenaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bakr, the university rector, said the relationship was more comparable to the 
historic, interdependent working relationship between the Americans and the 
Saudis in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between America and Saudi Arabia has been, throughout the 
past five decades, a contractual relationship, where the Saudis employed 
American expertise to help them develop and paid them well for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to overburden the American economy, if it is within Saudi 
Arabia's ability to share in the cost. We are beneficiaries here, and it's only 
fair to lessen the burden on the American taxpayer," he added. "We don't want 
to be like the Israelis and just be a sinkhole for American aid at the expense 
of American taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and subsequent outside military 
buildup, all these policies are being reexamined. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely there has been a change in the thinking, and not only at the level 
of the king and Prince Sultan (ibn Abdulaziz, the defense minister). It has 
been at the level of the people on the street," said one Saudi official close 
to the defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the military all are convinced now the armed forces have to be 
increased in number. Unfortunately, we have no choice but to have a reasonably 
large number. Definitely it's going to increase, and it's going to increase by 
a pretty large number." 
</P>
<P>
King Fahd recently ordered the opening of recruitment centers and also called 
for the mobilization of women in some military-related jobs. In the first week, 
10,000 men volunteered in Eastern province, and another 40,000 have signed up 
in Riyadh. Recruits are in four-week training courses throughout the kingdom 
and afterward will return to their regular jobs to await possible call-up. The 
king has stopped short of announcing any formal increase in the size of the 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced they've made a decision in their mind, but the political 
leadership, when they make a decision, they like to be very slow and very 
deliberate," a Saudi close to the government said. "They hate to be seen as 
reacting to a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Some outside analysts say that despite the overwhelming early volunteer 
response, the Saudis may have difficulty in recruiting a large permanent army. 
The oil boom accustomed many Saudis to seeking jobs as bankers and businessmen, 
not infantrymen, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to be officers," a Western diplomat said, "but do people like to 
be enlisted men? It's the type of thing that I think Saudis are really going to 
have to get used to." 
</P>
<P>
"We always had a problem recruiting people in the army, because the Saudis 
don't like wearing uniforms," a senior Saudi official conceded. "We don't like 
to be organized. We're better implementers than organizers." 
</P>
<P>
A Saudi recruit with a high school education can expect to earn about 4,000 
riyals a month, or about $1,050. But some Saudi officials said housing and 
children's education benefits provide attractive incentives, particularly for 
desert tribesmen who see military training as an honorable pursuit.

When Mayor Tom Bradley kicked off the Los Angeles Festival in San Pedro earlier 
this month, he stood behind a podium draped with the name of Occidental 
Petroleum Corp., a sponsor of the event since it was launched in 1984. The oil 
company's chairman, Armand Hammer, also was on hand to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Less visible to the public, however, has been the role of one group of 
executives whose support was considered crucial to this latest festival -- the 
Japanese business community. For the first time, 42 Japanese companies, from 
Aisin U.S.A. to Yamaha Motor Corp., contributed a total of $1 million, or about 
20% of the budget, for the two-week series of performances and art exhibits 
focusing on the Pacific Rim. The festival ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen A. Kindel, chairwoman of the festival, said the decision by Japanese 
business leaders to provide an infusion of money that was "not normally 
available to us" came when fund-raising prospects otherwise seemed bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"Without that commitment, there would be no festival," Kindel said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
What was a bonanza to the festival was also an important development in 
Japanese philanthropy -- one that is being eyed by cash-poor, nonprofit groups 
ranging from public television stations to fledgling theater companies. By 
championing an event that is both multicultural and non-traditional, the 
Japanese executives were not only helping to promote their own country but also 
signaling a new interest in building bridges to other ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
Almost unknown until five years ago, Japanese corporate giving to the arts, 
education and philanthropic causes has been increasing rapidly, fueled by deep 
worries about American hostility over the trade imbalance and such high-profile 
investments as Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Until very recently, Japanese contributions to the arts and education were 
largely restricted to major upscale institutions such as the Music Center, 
efforts to help Americans understand Japan -- touring Kabuki theater or bunraku 
puppet shows -- and endowed university chairs in science and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
But now, a new focus is slowly being added. Japanese companies, stung by 
criticism for not hiring enough minorities and women, are being told that being 
a "good corporate citizen" -- the phrase of the moment -- involves 
understanding the complexity and diversity of American society. Consequently, 
dollars earned in the United States by Japanese companies are starting to 
trickle in to mural projects, community-based cultural centers such as the one 
under construction in Torrance, and enrichment programs at inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is this emerging trend more obvious than in Southern California, 
according to Craig Smith, editor and publisher of the Seattle-based newsletter 
Corporate Philanthropy Report, and others. "What's distinctive about Japanese 
funding (here) is that it's spreading from the elite centers to more 
community-based organizations," he said. "We're seeing a linkage between the 
Japanese and their ethnic constituencies." 
</P>
<P>
A country with no tradition of philanthropy, Japan is now modifying its tax 
laws in order to stimulate more donations and make Tokyo officials more 
responsive when requests come in from U.S.-based executives. Both government 
and industry have dispatched representatives to study American giving 
practices. As further encouragement, 100 companies announced last spring they 
would contribute 1% of their net earnings before taxes to philanthropic causes. 
</P>
<P>
Smith estimates that Japanese companies will dole out $300 million this year -- 
a 30% increase over last year. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, Japanese philanthropy is being closely watched even though it 
is minuscule compared to U.S. corporate giving, which last year amounted to 
$5.6 billion. But while Japanese contributions are swelling, donations from 
American businesses are expected to grow only by $200 million this year, not 
enough to keep pace with inflation. With the current challenge to federal 
funding of the arts and the downturn in the U.S. economy, many arts 
organizations are trying to forge links with potential Japanese donors. 
</P>
<P>
By Smith's very rough estimate, Southern California captures only $10 million 
to $20 million of Japanese largess, but that is because the figures are skewed 
by the high cost (now estimated at $2 million each) of the chairs the Japanese 
have chosen to endow at top universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, UC Berkeley and Stanford. MIT alone has 22 chairs. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, support for community-based activities involves far more modest 
amounts. For example, Hitachi Ltd., whose Los Angeles representative, Masayuki 
Kohama, is spearheading the drive to broaden Japanese philanthropy, has 
contributed $20,000 to Social and Public Art Resources Center (SPARC), a 
multiethnic mural program headed by Judith Baca, $1,000 for a Korean Youth 
Center fund-raiser and $5,000 to a scholarship fund named for Democratic 
congressman Mervyn M. Dymally. The company's chemical subsidiary gave $15,000 
to the Orange County Performing Arts Center for a children's arts festival with 
what the center's director, Thomas R. Kendrick, described as "a strong 
multicultural orientation." 
</P>
<P>
Some of this giving is done in conjunction with the Hitachi Foundation, one of 
11 similar philanthropic organizations established in the United States by 
Japanese companies since 1984. This summer, the foundation, whose stated 
mission is to pursue "cross-cultural understanding" and "strengthen the 
infrastructure of American society," sponsored a tour by the Latino theater 
group El Teatro Campesino. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the newly articulated emphasis on grass roots America is most 
noticeable in the area of education. When American Honda Corp. set up its 
foundation, it gave grants to a wide variety of programs, from the Epilepsy 
Foundation to the JFK Performing Arts Center in Washington. Now the focus has 
been narrowed to "youth and science education." One Honda program provides 
scholarships to gifted needy students at Walter Reed Junior High School in 
North Hollywood to be set aside until the teen-agers are ready for college. 
</P>
<P>
The Panasonic Foundation is providing technical assistance to nine school 
districts, including San Diego's, which are trying to make fundamental changes 
in their school systems. Sophie Sa, the foundation's executive director, 
acknowledges that such help is not costly -- a total of $1 million a year -- 
but stresses that the long-term relationship with the school districts will 
make it easier for the program to have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan, which has been criticized for lagging behind the other companies in 
corporate philanthropy, is stepping up its efforts but has also decided to zero 
in on education by, for example, establishing literacy centers at East Los 
Angeles schools. "It' safe to say you can expect significant expansion of our 
corporate philanthropy programs," said company spokesman Don Spetner, who 
blames Nissan's slow start on the company's failure to "(perceive) ourselves as 
a part of corporate America." 
</P>
<P>
Like other Japanese companies, Nissan is sensitive about charges that the 
Japanese simply throw money at problems without really getting involved. Such 
criticism surfaced last year when the Japanese business community gave $10 
million to victims of the San Francisco earthquake. (Other critics, like former 
TRW Inc. analyst Pat Choate, argue that the Japanese are trying to expand their 
political influence in the United States through grass-roots giving.) 
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy is to have ownership in the program," Spetner said. "We get 
very involved, rather than just being a name on a list of contributors." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Nissan's self-imposed limitations, arts organizations are optimistic 
that many Japanese companies will heighten their involvement in the local 
cultural scene -- both by giving more money and by playing a more active role 
in fund raising, something only a handful of Japanese executives have done so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
Several have been partial to the Music Center. The 650-member Japanese Business 
Assn. raised more than $350,000 in the past fiscal year, with contributions 
from other Japanese companies bringing the total to nearly $1 million, 
according to Esther Wachtell, the organization's president. She said that 
figure does not include promotional activities such as the opening of "Phantom 
of the Opera," sponsored by Toyota's Lexus division, and the Hollywood Bowl 
jazz series, funded by Nissan's Infiniti division. (By comparison, however, 
Arco, whose headquarters are in downtown Los Angeles, gave the Music Center 
$200,000 during the same period and funded the opera company's $250,000 
production of "Oklahoma!") 
</P>
<P>
Jiro Ishizaka, chairman of the Japanese-owned Union Bank, sits on the Music 
Center's board along with Consul General Kiyohiko Arafune, and several other 
Japanese executives are also active fund-raisers. "The Japanese have been very 
good friends from the beginning, and we're proud of that," Wachtell said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Yukiyasu Togo, president of Toyota Motor Sales, USA, and a devotee 
of classical music, let it be known through an intermediary that he was 
interested in providing the pipe organ for Walt Disney Hall, the future home of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most other Japanese companies, Toyota, whose American headquarters are 
in Torrance, has long had a corporate giving program. And in contrast to most 
other U.S.-based officials, who have to be authorized by their Tokyo offices to 
donate more than $5,000, Togo has a free hand; no consultation was needed to 
enable him to write a $1-million check for the pipe organ, according to Jeffrey 
A. Smith, assistant to the president. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has not enjoyed quite as strong a 
relationship with the Japanese business community -- with one notable 
exception, according to development director Julie A. Johnston. Japanese 
companies raised $4 million both here and in Tokyo to aid in the construction 
of the Pavilion for Japanese Art, which opened in 1988. The group effort on 
behalf of the Pavilion, led by Toshio Nagamura, former chairman of Union Bank, 
became a model for fund-raising for the L.A. Festival. 
</P>
<P>
For most local arts institutions, Japanese companies remain a largely untapped 
resource, one that is especially welcome now that other sources of funding may 
be drying up. "I doubt whether they can make up the difference, but at least 
they can provide an additional funding source that we haven't totally 
utilized," said Frederick M. Nicholas, chairman of the Museum of Contemporary 
Art, which received $500,000 from the Shuwa Investments Corp., the Japanese 
real estate giant that owns Arco Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Although KCET, the public television station, has been receiving funding for 
cultural programming from the private E. Nakamichi Foundation for several 
years, it is only now beginning to loosen Japanese corporate purse strings, 
officials said. The first project, a documentary comparing Japanese and 
American education that will air later this year, was funded by Matsushita, 
Hitachi and the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Assn. at a cost of $536,000. 
</P>
<P>
Donald G. Youpa, KCET executive vice president, said he is optimistic about 
future funding now that Japanese understand how public television in this 
country works. 
</P>
<P>
But Alex Gibney, the Los Angeles-based executive producer of "The Pacific 
Century," a 10-part series slated to air on public television in 1992, came 
away empty-handed when he sought money from Japanese corporations. "They want 
to avoid controversy at all costs," he said, adding, however, that he did not 
yet have an American corporate sponsor either. 
</P>
<P>
Also eager for a share of Japanese support are local colleges and universities, 
where Japanese presence is so far minimal. One big exception is UC Irvine, site 
of a new $16.5-million biotechnology laboratory funded by Hitachi Chemical. 
Even before it opened in April, critics raised fears that Hitachi would use the 
lab to steal technological secrets. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, only UCLA, which has enough graduates in Japan to make it 
worthwhile to maintain a Tokyo alumni office, gets appreciable funding from 
Japanese corporations -- mostly in small amounts. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA lists two chairs endowed by Japanese corporations, one in 
Japanese-American studies and another in material science. Other corporate 
funding is helping to build an international student center. 
</P>
<P>
Despite USC's interest in Asia -- 25 of its faculty members are experts on 
Japan -- the private university "has not had a lot of success" in getting 
Japanese corporate money, said Paul Blodgett, associate vice president for 
development. He said USC is trying to interest Sony in contributing to its film 
school and is also talking to Hitachi, Toyota and Honda. 
</P>
<P>
Building relationships with the Japanese takes time, according to Gordon M. 
Berger, former head of USC's East Asian Studies Center, which has received 
about $160,000 in fellowship money from a private Japanese organization but 
little else. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese want to have a sense of a long-term relationship rather than a 
one-night stand," he said.

HOW GOODS COULD REACH IRAQ DESPITE THE BLOCKADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions against Iraq and the multinational armada enforcing them 
have succeeded in stopping virtually all of Iraq's exports of oil as well as 
most imports of bulk items. Smaller cargoes are harder to stop, and a complete 
halt to smuggling would be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Some countries that are sympathetic to Iraq have already flown in food and 
medicines, permitted for "humanitarian purposes" under the U.N. resolution. 
Here are several ways that other smuggled goods could get to Iraq and 
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Illicit transshipment via Jordan: Middlemen can import goods through Aqaba 
under the false pretense that they are for Jordanian use, and then pass them 
through to Iraq over a border that Jordan guards only halfheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
Over remote borders by truck: The main roads and border crossings are sealed. 
But the high possible fro smuggling can make it worthwhile for smugglers' 
trucks to brave hard-to-police remote tracks through Iran's Zagros Mountains, 
across the Syrian desert, or through eastern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
By air over the blockade: Short of shooting it down, there is no way blockaders 
can keep an airborne cargo jet from reaching its destination. Iraq has its own 
fleet of 78 large jets and 18 captured Kuwaiti craft that could bring in up to 
90,000 tons of goods a month from as far away as Libya. Some flights carrying 
food may already have reached Iraq from Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Up the gulf by dhow: Coastal trading boats called dhows have traditionally 
carried small amounts of cargo among Persian Gulf ports. They are hard to 
detect or stop. Dhows could say they are sailing for Iranian ports of Bushehr 
or Bandar Khomeini, then divert to Iraq or Kuwait once they are beyond the 
reach of blockading warships.

U.S., SYRIA AGREE ARABS MUST TAKE LEAD IN SOLVING THE CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: BAKER MEETS WITH ASSAD IN DAMASCUS. THE TWO ALSO AGREE THAT U.S. 
TROOPS MUST LEAVE THE REGION WHEN IRAQ LEAVES KUWAIT.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III agreed Friday with Syrian President Hafez 
Assad that the Arab world must take the lead in rolling back Iraq's occupation 
of Kuwait and that American ground troops must be withdrawn from the region as 
soon as the crisis ends. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about the importance of this being an Arab solution," Baker told 
reporters after a 4 1/2-hour meeting with Assad. "One thing, I think, that is 
demonstrated by the fact of my presence here today is that this is, indeed, 
largely an Arab solution that we are trying to implement." 
</P>
<P>
Baker gave no hint of how an Arab solution could be achieved, but his remarks 
paralleled a speech by Assad on Tuesday that called for the removal of all 
foreign troops from the region after the Iraqis are out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush late last week ordered Baker to visit Damascus. Bush decided to 
take the step after two telephone conversations with Assad, but U.S. officials 
refused to say which of the two presidents proposed the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Baker gave Bush an immediate report on his meeting, talking to him for about 15 
minutes over a secure radio circuit from the Air Force plane that carried him 
from Damascus to Rome. The quick call to the White House was unusual but not 
unprecedented, a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States and Syria find themselves on the same side in the 
gulf crisis, their overall relationship continues to be what a Western diplomat 
characterized as "adversarial." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his deference to Syria's demand for an Arab solution, Baker left little 
doubt, at a joint news conference with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh, 
that he had clashed sharply with Assad on the subject of terrorism. The United 
States has long accused Damascus of supporting international terrorism, and the 
Syrian government has been implicated in the still-unsolved bombing of Pan 
American Airways Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Syria has not expelled Ahmed Jibril and his Damascus-based Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, which has been widely 
accused of being responsible for the Pan Am bombing, Shareh said, "We don't 
have evidence so far." He said Syria would try to punish anyone linked to 
terrorism by "hard evidence." 
</P>
<P>
"There is . . . a disagreement between us on the sufficiency of the evidence," 
Baker snapped. "This is a subject that is very important as far as the United 
States is concerned. We have had, indeed, an extensive discussion of the 
question of Pan Am 103." 
</P>
<P>
He provided no additional information. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the dispute over terrorism prevented his visit -- the first to 
Damascus by a U.S. secretary of state in more than two years -- from thawing 
the frozen relationship between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy cannot and never will be amoral," Baker said. "We can have close 
relations only with countries that share our fundamental values. That is not to 
say we cannot improve relations where we have a common goal and a common 
interest, as we have in this case. We can substantially improve our 
relationship if we can overcome these problems we have with terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Assad has sent about 3,000 troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates 
to join the U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf. He is expected to send an 
armored division, between 10,000 and 15,000 troops, as soon as he can find 
transportation for them. That would make Syria's the largest Arab contingent in 
the force. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat said Assad expects to receive a substantial increase in aid 
payments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a result of the 
deployment. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, an Israeli official said his government will not try to take 
advantage of the gap in Syria's military position left by the armored 
division's redeployment. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Syria to feel safe from us," the Israeli official said, "and we think 
the fact that they are prepared to move a division indicates that it does. We 
won't do anything to take advantage of the military situation. There is a 
convergence of both our interests here." 
</P>
<P>
Although Washington and Damascus share the goal of getting the Iraqis out of 
Kuwait, their motivations are substantially different. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat who is not an American said Assad is an opportunist who expects to 
profit from the encounter both financially and by settling scores with Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein, a longtime rival. Also, Syria's participation in the 
multinational force in Saudi Arabia will help repair its relations with Saudi 
Arabia and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems clear that Syria, which has long occupied areas of Lebanon that 
Damascus claims as part of "greater Syria," cannot share Washington's aversion 
to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, which Baghdad claims as its own territory. 
</P>
<P>
By endorsing Assad's call for an Arab solution to the crisis, Baker moved far 
away from his earlier suggestion that only the United States could lead the 
campaign to force an end to the Iraqi occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Sept. 4 in a statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, "We 
remain the one nation that has the necessary political, military and economic 
instruments at our disposal to catalyze a successful collective response by the 
international community." 
</P>
<P>
In his joint appearance with Shareh, however, Baker said, "We have no intention 
or desire to establish a permanent military ground presence in this region, and 
as soon as this crisis will permit, our armed forces will be brought back to 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Baker has suggested creating some sort of regional security structure, probably 
with U.S. and Soviet participation, that would contain Iraqi ambitions if the 
present crisis ends peacefully, leaving Hussein's powerful army undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
But he has not yet spelled out the details of the idea. Asked Friday if such a 
structure would eventually include Israel, Baker said the Israeli government 
should not be rejected out of hand despite the aversion of most Arab 
governments to dealings with the Jewish state.

MILITARY: 7TH ARMORED BRIGADE FOUGHT NAZIS IN WORLD WAR II. LONDON'S MESSAGE TO 
IRAQ'S HUSSEIN: HE WILL LOSE.

<P>
In its largest deployment of tanks and artillery since World War II, Britain 
announced Friday that it is sending a full armored brigade to Saudi Arabia as a 
message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that "one way or the other he will 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's evil aggression must be reversed," Defense Secretary Tom King said in 
announcing the decision to deploy the famed 7th Armored Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
It includes 120 Challenger main battle tanks, more than 6,000 ground troops, a 
field artillery regiment with 155-millimeter self-propelled guns, an armored 
infantry battalion equipped with scores of armored cars and tanks, and 
accompanying squadrons of attack and patrol helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The move is the largest single military contribution to the multinational force 
opposing Iraq after that of the United States. King told reporters he hoped it 
would lead other Western European countries to consider making a similar 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
King emphasized that Britain, while it favors a peaceful settlement of the 
crisis, is fully prepared to join in an allied military operation against Iraq 
if the U.N. sanctions fail to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Britain decided to increase its military commitment, he said, because "now, 
clearly, there is a case for reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
The armored brigade will join three squadrons of jet fighters, 12 warships and 
3,000 ground personnel that Britain already has in the gulf region. King said 
it is meant "to make it quite clear to Saddam Hussein . . . that one way or 
another they will have to leave Kuwait, and that they better do it sooner than 
later." 
</P>
<P>
King made it clear that deployment of the 7th Brigade, the "Desert Rats" of the 
North African campaign in World War II, will take weeks or months to complete. 
Just the voyage out to Saudi Arabia will take three weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The logistics are further complicated by the fact that the Royal Navy does not 
have the ships to transport the brigade. King said the government will hire 
ships, but defense analysts in London said that many such vessels have already 
been hired by the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't answer that at the moment," the defense secretary said when asked 
to be more specific about the timing of the operation. He appealed to the media 
"to appreciate the scale of the operation." 
</P>
<P>
King was questioned closely about the cost of Britain's commitment to the gulf 
campaign. Last week he told the House of Commons that Britain was spending $2 
million a day, in addition to an initial outlay of $150 million for deployment, 
on its fighter and naval squadrons and limited ground forces. The new force, he 
said, will raise the maintenance cost to at least $4 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's firm stand against Iraq's conquest 
of Kuwait has received strong public and political support. Opinion polls have 
shown a steady increase in the popularity of both the prime minister and her 
Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Even the opposition Labor Party has given Thatcher its backing in the gulf 
crisis. Labor leader Neil Kinnock said Thursday that "we now have a noose 
around Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and that noose must stay tight." 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis has become a highly emotional issue here. According to U.N. 
figures, Iraq is holding at least 220 Britons at strategic targets in Iraq and 
Kuwait, twice the known number of Americans held in this way. Thousands of 
other Britons are either hiding in Kuwait or are prevented from leaving Iraq.

Japan is considering sending thousands of people to the Middle East to take 
part in the multinational effort against Iraq and debating whether to include 
members of the armed forces, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
No decision is expected soon, the spokesman, Taizo Watanabe, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Japan announced that it will commit $4 billion to the 
Middle East campaign, half of it for the multinational force and half for the 
countries suffering the most severe economic impact, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
The government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are debating a "U.N. 
Peace Cooperation Bill" to be submitted to Parliament. The debate is likely to 
go on for months, according to a Foreign Ministry official who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
According to Watanabe, the ministry spokesman, one of the issues being debated 
is whether to include servicemen in the personnel sent to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Japan has said it will send 100 civilian medical personnel to the 
Middle East, and Watanabe said the first 17 of these will leave Tuesday for 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe criticized the House of Representatives for voting Wednesday to demand 
that Japan pay the entire cost of maintaining American troops in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder," he said, "how many of them know that Japan is already the largest 
contributor of host nation support to U.S. forces anywhere in the world? We 
have made it clear again and again . . . that we are prepared to examine an 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes Congress would not have criticized Japan if it had known of 
the Middle East aid program Japan announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning, several hours after (Iraq's invasion of Kuwait), Japan 
made it clear that we would not condone this outrageous act," Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had not consulted Japan before sending troops to the 
Middle East and that this delayed Japan's learning of the details of the need 
for financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the need for urgent action," he said, "but for the future, there 
should be a much better framework for consultation." 
</P>
<P>
He said Japan is the only non-Arab country that has announced aid for both the 
multinational force and for Middle East countries suffering because of the 
sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Michael H. Armacost, who had urged Japan to increase its 
initial pledge of $1 billion in aid to the multinational force, issued a 
statement praising Friday's move as "a major new financial contribution." 
</P>
<P>
"This decision clearly demonstrates that Japan is a full partner in the ongoing 
efforts of the international community to work toward a just and peaceful 
resolution of the crisis," Armacost said.

BRAZIL COMPUTER SALE SPLITS U.S. OFFICIALS;

TECHNOLOGY: PROCESSOR CAN BE USED TO MAKE BALLISTIC AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

<P>
A split has developed within the Bush Administration over whether to allow IBM 
to sell Brazil supercomputer equipment that some experts contend could help 
Iraq improve its missile technology and develop nuclear weapons, according to 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the pending export is expected to go to the National Security 
Council at the White House next week. And Congress is about to jump into the 
fray with the introduction of Senate legislation to block the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment involved is called a vector processor, which would upgrade an 
existing IBM computer to supercomputer status at Embraer, the Brazilian 
aircraft manufacturer. Supercomputers are among the most powerful tools 
available for designing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
An application to export a second supercomputer to the University of Sao Paulo 
was recently returned to IBM by the Commerce Department for additional 
information, an IBM spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns have been raised about both sales because Brazil has been helping Iraq 
improve its missile capabilities and because of its past arms sales to Baghdad. 
A congressional background paper said there is "strong evidence" that 
information has been exchanged between Embraer personnel and Brazilian weapons 
experts in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
A team of 23 Brazilian arms experts remains in Iraq, along with other foreign 
engineers working on missile projects, the Wall Street Journal reported last 
week. The Brazilian government has disclaimed any knowledge of the activities 
of the engineers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed shipment of the supercomputer equipment to Brazil is part of a 
growing debate over the transfer of technology with both commercial and 
military uses to countries aiding Iraq.

"At this time, when the threat of a military confrontation with Iraq is a real 
possibility, sales of this nature to Brazil are contrary to the national 
interest in the short and long run," said Rep. Lawrence J. Smith (D-Fla.) in a 
letter he and 24 others in the House Foreign Affairs Committee sent to Bush 
Administration officials Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.) plans to introduce an amendment that would bar the 
sale of supercomputers and related technology to any country involved in aiding 
Iraq in development of chemical weapons, ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In July the Administration blocked a U.S. firm's sale of industrial furnaces to 
Iraq because of worries that they could be used on nuclear weapons projects. 
The Commerce Department had approved the sale a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, the State Department approved the export of rocket 
components to Brazil despite the concerns of some experts that they could be 
used to aid Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the IBM supercomputer equipment, the Commerce and State 
departments support the sale to Brazil, while the Arms Control and Disarmament 
Agency and Department of Energy are said to oppose the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Something is amiss at the Commerce Department," Kasten said. "We need to 
tighten domestic control on the sale of American supercomputers and other high 
technology to countries such as Brazil, who turn around and transfer it to 
madmen like (Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein."

DISSIDENT QUITS MEXICO'S RULING PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE DEFECTION OF RODOLFO GONZALEZ GUEVARA IS LIKELY TO IGNITE 
DIVISIVE DEBATES WITHIN THE PRI. HE CHARGES THE GROUP HAS BECOME UNDEMOCRATIC.

<P>
The Institutional Revolutionary Party's most outspoken dissident has resigned, 
asserting that a national assembly held this month was "a masquerade" that 
proved the ruling party is undemocratic and unwilling to separate from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Gonzalez Guevara's resignation is the biggest blow to the PRI, as the 
party is called, since leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas quit in October, 
1987, to run as an opposition candidate for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
A former secretary general of the PRI and member of the party for 44 years, 
Gonzalez Guevara spearheaded the dissident faction known as Critical Current, 
which has been pushing for an internal democratization, honest elections and a 
separation of party and state. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Guevara's resignation is not likely to provoke a mass exodus from the 
PRI, but it will produce painful and, most likely, divisive debates within the 
party. Together with the departure of the "Cardenistas," it gives the 
impression that there is no room for true dissent within the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Guevara's resignation also is a setback for President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari, who has vowed to bring about democratic reforms in Mexican politics 
but who issued a scathing attack on his critics during the PRI's 14th party 
convention, which ended Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Guevara has been critical of Salinas' neo-liberal economic program, a 
radical departure from the original philosophy of the party that grew out of 
the Mexican Revolution and has ruled for 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas has pared down the Mexican state and sold off government companies. His 
economic austerity program has eaten away at workers' salaries, and he has 
allied his government closely with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In his resignation letter, made public Thursday, Gonzalez Guevara said he was 
committed to "the ideas of the Mexican Revolution" and an independent party. He 
had been pushing for the party to switch from an organization based on tightly 
controlled sectors -- labor, farmers and bureaucrats -- to one based on 
geographic representation with secret elections for party posts. 
</P>
<P>
Most PRI leaders reacted to his resignation respectfully and with regret. But 
Fidel Velazquez, the 90-year-old patriarch of the PRI's Mexican Workers' 
Confederation, one of the three party sectors, lashed out at him. 
</P>
<P>
"When you cut a dead branch from a tree, the tree is better off," Velazquez 
said. Gonzalez Guevara responded in a radio interview that Velazquez has been 
"the principal cause of anti-democracy in the party." 
</P>
<P>
At the party convention, Velazquez's labor sector managed to stave off reforms 
that would have reduced its power and the muscle of all sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Guevara has been an undersecretary of interior; head of the ruling 
party's think tank, the Center for Social, Political and Economic Studies, and 
twice a member of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the National 
Congress. As Mexico's ambassador to Spain from 1984 to 1987, he joined Cardenas 
in forming the first dissident faction within the PRI, the Democratic Current. 
</P>
<P>
During the party convention in February, 1987, then-PRI chief Jorge de la Vega 
Dominguez announced that the party did not accept "internal currents," which he 
likened to a fifth column. After that, Cardenas withdrew from all party duties, 
and he resigned in October, when a tiny opposition party offered to back him 
for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas has since formed his own party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Guevara, who chose not to leave the party with Cardenas in 1987, 
formed the Critical Current soon thereafter. He wrote many controversial 
articles in the Mexico City daily newspaper, Excelsior, accusing the government 
of election fraud and pushing for change within the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Guevara does not rule out the possibility of joining forces with 
Cardenas, but he said he would not enlist in any party right now. He also said 
he was considering forming his own party for the 1994 presidential election, a 
move that likely would hurt Cardenas as much as the PRI.

Government troops fought house-to-house with Tamil rebels in the town of Jaffna 
on Friday, a day after Sri Lankan forces stormed a colonial fort in the rebel 
stronghold to rescue a trapped garrison. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were putting up 
strong resistance as troops advanced to clear rebel positions around the fort. 
</P>
<P>
"There's house-to-house fighting going on there," a military officer said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 soldiers stormed into Jaffna on Thursday and relieved the garrison, 
which had been under rebel siege for the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday morning, 24 soldiers, including five officers, and 130 rebels were 
killed in the first 24 hours, military sources said. About 130 soldiers were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In the farming outpost of Vavuniya, 70 miles south of Jaffna, a senior military 
officer said Tamil rebels were becoming divided and were sending peace feelers 
to the army. 
</P>
<P>
"We ignore them or pretend to have not received these messages," the officer 
said. "The rebels in this area seem to want a cease-fire. But that is for the 
politicians to decide. Until then, we will hold and consolidate our positions."

FORMER MOSSAD CHIEFS ATTACK BOOK OF 'LIES'

<P>
Former Mossad chiefs and Israeli officials Friday characterized information in 
a controversial book on the Israeli intelligence agency as "inflated out of 
proportion" and called its Canadian-Israeli author a traitor and liar. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a New York state appeals court lifted a lower court's ban on the 
distribution of "By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad 
Officer," written by former Israeli intelligence agent Victor Ostrovsky and 
Canadian journalist Claire Hoy. 
</P>
<P>
Avi Pazner, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's media adviser, characterized the 
book as "nothing more than a compilation of lies, half-truths, invention, very 
few facts and very sick imagination." On Thursday, however, Israeli Embassy 
spokeswoman Ruth Yaron in Washington said that her government felt there were 
"details that could harm the security of Israel and Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts argue that the book, which faces a ban on distribution in Canada at 
least until Sept. 17, threatens to confront Israel with its biggest 
embarrassment since nuclear engineer Mordechai Vanunu revealed in 1986 that 
Israel had stockpiled weapons-grade plutonium at a nuclear plant in Dimona. 
Mossad agents caught Vanunu in Rome and brought him back to Israel, where he 
was sentenced to 18 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Army Radio reported the current Mossad chief had been summoned to testify next 
week before a special session of the Parliament's subcommittee on secret 
services. The Mossad chief, who under security regulations cannot be named, 
will be asked to provide "clarifications and explanations" of the Ostrovsky 
affair, the radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Ostrovsky, a Canadian-Israeli who was a Mossad agent from 1984 to 1986, 
maintains Israel is waging a major smear campaign against him because of the 
book, including claims that Ostrovsky was involved in financial wrongdoings and 
the falsification of credit cards -- claims Ostrovsky denies. 
</P>
<P>
Isser Harel and Meir Amit, two former Mossad chiefs during the 1950s and 1960s, 
said they view Ostrovsky as a liar and a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not familiar with the specific data (in the book), but I know enough about 
the modus operandi of the Mossad, the division of responsibilities, et cetera, 
that I can say that some of the stories I heard are baseless," Amit told Israel 
Radio.

DEMOCRATS PLAN TO ATTACK BUSH ON HOME FRONT 
</P>

<P>
Democratic Party leaders Friday unveiled a revised campaign strategy for the 
1990 elections in the wake of the Middle East crisis: back President Bush in 
his confrontation with Iraq but challenge him on his handling of the economy, 
energy policy, the savings and loan scandal and other domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
The blueprint emerged as the executive committee of the Democratic National 
Committee, beginning its two-day annual fall meeting, unanimously endorsed a 
resolution proposed by Ron Brown, chairman of the committee, calling on the 
President to "stop (Iraqi) aggression in the Persian Gulf but start fighting a 
recession at home." 
</P>
<P>
The new battle plan reflects the transformation of the political landscape 
since Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait led Bush to order the biggest U.S. 
military buildup of the post-Vietnam era. Before the events in the Persian Gulf 
occurred, Democrats had seized the political initiative, accusing the Bush 
Administration of bungling the bailout of the debt-ridden savings and loan 
industry. The Republicans had seemed in disarray because Bush had retracted his 
"read-my-lips" pledge on no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Middle East crisis, by diverting public attention from domestic issues, 
has threatened to rob the Democratic offensive of its momentum and forced party 
leaders to shield themselves from criticism by proclaiming their support of the 
President in his role as commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we can have Iraq be an issue in this campaign," Paul Tully, 
the party's national political director, said in an interview. "If the voters 
have to make a choice on that issue, it will work only one way, in support of 
the President. We can't send any mixed signals to (Iraq President) Saddam 
Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Democrats maintain that their patriotic stance does not prevent them 
from striking out at Bush and the GOP on other issues. Friday's resolution, 
while expressing "support for our armed forces and the Persian Gulf policy of 
our commander in chief," refers to "profound differences over national 
direction" between Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution denounces the President's proposed capital gains tax cut as a 
"giveaway to the rich," contrasted with Democratic efforts "to assure a fair 
and progressive tax system with the wealthy paying their fair share." 
</P>
<P>
The closest the resolution comes to questioning Bush's management of the Middle 
East crisis is contained in a reference to the way that the burden of financing 
Operation Desert Shield is being shared. The resolution states that "our 
prosperous allies in Europe and Japan must now assume a full share of the 
burden of defending our mutual interests in peace." 
</P>
<P>
In an address to the executive committee, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: "We're going to have to ask the 
Japanese diplomatically but firmly to get off their wallets."

CONGRESS: GOP ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF SPREADING 'GARBAGE' THROUGH NEWS LEAKS.

Partisan wrangling over the impact of President Bush's proposed capital gains 
tax cut disrupted the budget summit talks Friday and slowed progress toward 
agreement on a plan to reduce the federal deficit by $500 billion over the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Bush described the 4-month-old negotiations as "like a roller coaster, kind of 
up and down," as he left to spend a weekend at his Camp David retreat. But the 
President reported that, despite the political furor, his top aides still 
believed they were "closing the gap" with congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Several Republican senators expressed outrage over news reports disclosing that 
the GOP tax proposal would lower taxes for people with incomes above $50,000 
and raise taxes for those with lower incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) accused the Democrats of spreading 
"garbage" through news leaks and declared: "I am not certain we ought to 
continue to negotiate on this basis. Frankly, I am sick of it." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, charged Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), have embarked on a "concerted, 
partisan effort to affix blame," saying he has been unfairly tagged with 
advocating unpopular changes in Medicare fees. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) responded that he deplored 
unauthorized disclosures of budget discussions but said that Republicans had 
done the same thing to advance their viewpoint in the media. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to limit the benefits that upper-income taxpayers would receive 
from the President's proposed capital gains tax cut, GOP negotiators now favor 
imposing a luxury tax on certain expensive consumer goods and a $10,000 limit 
on federal deductions for state and local income taxes. But the Republican 
plan, which GOP lawmakers defend as necessary to stimulate the sagging U.S. 
economy, still would favor wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, being held in seclusion at Andrews Air Force Base in an effort to 
preserve confidentiality, were recessed until Sunday evening after the angry 
outbursts. Sources close to the negotiations, however, said they doubted that 
the episode would doom the bipartisan attempt to achieve a deficit-cutting 
package. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal for a drastic reduction in the capital gains tax on the profit 
from the sale of assets like stocks, bonds and real estate clearly remains the 
most divisive issue. Congressional analysts said it would reduce tax revenues 
by $24.5 billion over five years, but advocates contend it would create jobs, 
stimulate the economy and add to the government's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats said 80% of the benefits from such a tax cut would go to people with 
incomes above $100,000, the same Americans who have received the largest tax 
cuts during the last decade and have the greatest ability to pay higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The latest Democratic offer would put a 20% surtax on incomes above $500,000 a 
year. It would also eliminate the current $51,300 income limit on payment of 
the 1.45% Medicare tax, raise gasoline taxes by 11 cents a gallon, add a 4% tax 
on other forms of energy and boost alcohol taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic plan calls on the wealthy to sacrifice along with others who 
will be affected by any budget-cutting measure; it would protect those making 
less than $20,000 a year while raising taxes on all other income groups by 
$26.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Unless a budget agreement is reached by Oct. 1, the Gramm-Rudman law could 
slash $100 billion from the $1.2-trillion federal budget, forcing government 
agencies to cut back their services sharply and cutting the Pentagon budget by 
one-third despite the crisis in the Persian Gulf. If no agreement is reached by 
Sept. 28, Bush plans to submit his own deficit-cutting package to Congress for 
a vote.

$100-MILLION JACKPOT CAUSES LOTTOMANIA

Prospective millionaires jammed convenience stores, supermarkets and gas 
stations from Pensacola to Key West Friday in the waning hours of a weeklong 
buying frenzy that has produced a record Florida Lotto jackpot that may yet 
grow into the richest in history. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated payoff: $100 million plus. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of winning: 1 in 13,983,816. 
</P>
<P>
The number of players who don't believe they'll win: 0. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks they're going to win," said Dave Sweezy, director of the Miami 
regional lottery office. "I guess that's human nature. But we are urging 
moderation, reminding them it only takes one." 
</P>
<P>
Try telling that to the lady who flew in from Las Vegas Friday morning and 
bought 1,200 of the $1 tickets. Or the players in Tampa and Pensacola who each 
bought $10,000 worth of tickets. Or Michael Taylor, a 21-year-old University of 
Miami student who Friday afternoon stood in line behind about 30 other hopefuls 
in a Circle K store in Coral Gables. "I already had 10 tickets," he said, "but 
then I thought of some more numbers. And I just had a feeling. So I'm back to 
buy five more." 
</P>
<P>
Despite radio spots from the lottery commission and advice from Florida Gov. 
Bob Martinez to "play responsibly," something akin to gold-rush fever continues 
to rage. "People are coming in with $100, $200, even $300, and they all think 
that, with a little luck, it could be them," said Frank Soler, owner of Frank's 
Discount in Miami. Many are first-time players. Most players normally spend no 
more than $5 or $10 a week on the lottery, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami's Latino neighborhoods, this lottery prize is called "el gordo," the 
fat one. But people from all over the country are seeing it as the chance of a 
lifetime. "I've had calls from every state," said Sweezy, including one from 
California, where a group of investors offered a check for $13.9 million in 
exchange for tickets covering every possible combination. 
</P>
<P>
Sweezy explained that it would take one terminal 63 weeks to print out 13.9 
million tickets. "These people aren't thinking," he added. 
</P>
<P>
So many out-of-state players have been driving into Florida that the lottery 
commission set up an extra 30 terminals along the Georgia and Alabama borders. 
Hundreds of Bahamians have flown into Miami this week to buy thousands of 
tickets, most for illegal resale in the islands, officials admit. 
</P>
<P>
It's been four weeks since anyone has picked the right six numbers in the 
weekly Lotto game, and the prize has ballooned to the highest since the Florida 
lottery was begun in May, 1988. The largest lottery jackpot on record is the 
$115 million awarded earlier this year in Pennsylvania. That mark could be 
topped, officials say, if sales Friday and today, typically the biggest of the 
week, continue at the current pace and if the computers hold up. 
</P>
<P>
At their peak Friday afternoon, the lottery's 7,500 terminals were spitting out 
tickets at the rate of almost 600 per second. 
</P>
<P>
While nothing is expected to slow Florida's Lottomania until sales are cut off 
30 minutes before today's drawing at 11 p.m., one tragic reminder that money 
does not guarantee happiness did surface earlier in the week. The body of a 
35-year-old man was pulled from the Miami River Thursday morning, a week after 
he had claimed $10,000 won in a scratch-off lottery game. He had $2,505 in his 
pocket and an empty wine bottle stuck in the front of his pants, police said. 
The county medical examiner Friday ruled his death an accidental drowning.

The United Auto Workers union, apparently confident a settlement is near, 
ignored a midnight Friday strike deadline and said it would keep bargaining 
toward a new contract covering 300,000 active workers at General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW notified local union leaders around the country to stay on the job or 
report to work as scheduled "until further notice," extending indefinitely the 
three-year agreement that expired at 11:59 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bargaining at GM headquarters in Detroit continued past midnight and the 
negotiators agreed to continue talks this morning. In letting the deadline 
slip, the union in effect was giving itself until Monday to conclude an 
agreement. That is when 300 union leaders convene here to vote on any new pact.

There was no indication of what was preventing a settlement, but two issues 
reflecting the steady decline of jobs at GM -- job security and limiting the 
auto company's practice of farming work out to subcontractors -- have been the 
hardest to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials would only say late Friday night that "we are continuing our 
efforts to reach a settlement." But Alfred S. Warren, GM's top bargainer, said 
he thinks "meaningful progress has been made" and that an agreement will be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the contract expired on a Friday night meant that a strike would 
have had little impact before Monday anyway. Only one GM plant, in Bowling 
Green, Ky., is scheduled to work today, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with GM covers workers at 240 plant sites in 33 states. Included 
are about 3,500 in California, of which 3,200 are at the Van Nuys assembly 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement without a strike has been expected all along in the talks, which 
have appeared unusually harmonious since the UAW last month chose GM as the 
company it would focus on first in the round of negotiations with the Big Three 
auto firms. 
</P>
<P>
The union's national contracts with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. also 
expired Friday night, but they were automatically extended. The UAW will 
attempt to duplicate its GM agreement at Ford and Chrysler, but hard-pressed 
Chrysler has served notice that it needs relief and would demand a cheaper 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Few details of the negotiations have become public. But wages and other 
traditional economic issues were secondary to the union's demand for additional 
safety nets for displaced workers and GM's emphasis on finding ways to reduce 
the cost of making cars. 
</P>
<P>
GM has tried in the bargaining to cut its health care costs, for example, 
saying the medical tab for its middle-aged work force and huge ranks of 
retirees comes to $622 per car. By comparison, the foreign auto firms that have 
set up assembly plants in this country and hired a new, younger work force face 
health care costs of just $60 per car. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest conflict was in reconciling the UAW's demand for a "no-layoff" 
policy, in effect, guaranteeing pay for workers who lose their jobs, and GM's 
goal of slashing its work force by another 60,000 workers over the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, GM's U.S. blue-collar employment has tumbled by some 170,000, or 
nearly 40%. 
</P>
<P>
The base wage for a GM assembler is $14.01 per hour. Bargainers were believed 
to be negotiating a 3% raise the first year and lump-sum "bonuses" in 
subsequent years, similar to the agreement signed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In Toronto, contract talks between Canadian Auto Workers union and Ford's 
Canadian subsidiary ended for the day without a settlement, paving the way for 
a walkout. Those talks also faced a midnight deadline, but Canadian Ford plants 
are closed weekends. The CAW represents about 12,800 Ford workers. 
</P>
<P>
A strike at Ford of Canada would quickly cripple up to seven U.S. assembly 
plants at Ford that make some of Ford's most successful vehicles. A glass plant 
in Niagara Falls, Ont., for example, makes all the windshields for Ford's 
F-series pickup truck.

TUMOR VICTIM LOSES BID TO FREEZE HEAD BEFORE DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
CRYONICS: JUDGE SAYS REQUEST IS A 'GIANT STEP' BEYOND RULINGS ALLOWING 
TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS TO REFUSE MEDICAL TREATMENT.

A Superior Court judge on Friday rejected the petition of a computer consultant 
with an inoperable brain tumor who sued the state for the right to have his 
head frozen before he dies in the hope that scientists will discover a way to 
remove the tumor and attach the head to a healthy body. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, the first of its kind in the county, could have broad implications in 
the issue of a terminally ill person's right to choose how and when he dies. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Donaldson, 46, is a longtime proponent of cryonics, the controversial 
practice of freezing people after they have died in the hope that someday they 
can be revived. While there is nothing illegal about that practice, Donaldson 
wants to take it a step further and be chemically frozen while he is alive. 
</P>
<P>
If he waits until he dies a natural death, the tumor will have destroyed his 
brain to such an extent that "there would be no point in being revived," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the current, stupid criteria, my brain could be entirely destroyed 
before I'm declared legally dead," Donaldson said Friday. "That's why I filed 
the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Ronald Stevens said that while the courts have allowed 
terminally ill patients to refuse medical treatment, it would be a "giant step" 
to allow cryonic technicians to freeze Donaldson before he is legally dead. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, those assisting Donaldson could be prosecuted for murder or 
assisting a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Atty. Gen. Kristofer Jorstad, who represented the state, said 
Donaldson can "put a bullet into his own heart. . . . But he can't have people 
associated with cryonics put that bullet into his heart. That's murder one." 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson has 30 days to amend the lawsuit and resubmit the petition to the 
judge. If he is unsuccessful, he plans to appeal the case. 
</P>
<P>
"If the case goes all the way to the Supreme Court and they turn me down, I'll 
just starve myself to death," he said. "Then I can be frozen before my brain 
goes and no one can be prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson's attorney, Christopher Ashworth, said his client has a 
constitutional right -- "the right of privacy" -- to end his life when he 
chooses. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason Thomas Donaldson should have to die screaming in his 
pillow," Ashworth said after the hearing. "He shouldn't have to endure the pain 
and degradation of waiting until the tumor slowly destroys him." 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson is seeking to prevent local and state authorities from interfering 
with his cryonic suspension. He wants to prevent those involved with the 
procedure from being prosecuted. And he wants to ensure that the county coroner 
does not perform an autopsy, which would make him "unsuitable for effective 
preservation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While most scientists are skeptical of cryonics, Donaldson believes that 
eventually there will be technology to bring him back to life and safely remove 
his brain tumor. And because only his head will be preserved, he is counting on 
future scientists to use his cells to create another body. 
</P>
<P>
The head would be surgically removed and bequeathed to the Alcor Life Extension 
Foundation, a nonprofit cryonic organization with a facility in a Riverside 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Under the procedure, Donaldson would be anesthetized and placed on a heart-lung 
machine while he is still alive. Then the cooling process would begin as 
technicians injected a chemical solution to replace his blood. The chemicals 
prevent formation of ice crystals, he said, and minimize damage caused by 
freezing. 
</P>
<P>
After Donaldson's head is removed, it would be placed in a device that looks 
like a "giant stainless steel Thermos," said Alcor President Carlos Mondragon. 
Liquid nitrogen would keep the head at a temperature of 320 degrees Fahrenheit 
below zero. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually take a more conservative position than most people who just want 
to incinerate a body or feed it to the insects," Mondragon said. "We're saying 
instead, we'll put you into the best holding pattern that we can currently 
devise, and then wait for technology to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson said he is not the sort of "flake" some people associate with 
cryonics. He has a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Chicago and 
has held high-powered computer jobs with Silicon Valley firms. But he became 
intrigued with cryonics during the 1970s when he learned of scientific 
experiments in which human organs were frozen, he said, and then functioned for 
a short time after being thawed. 
</P>
<P>
"As I see it, this is the only alternative to death," said Donaldson, of 
Sunnyvale. "I know we don't have all the technology right now, but I think it's 
entirely possible in the future." 
</P>
<P>
And to ensure that he has some company in an era when all his contemporaries 
will be dead, his wife has signed up for the program too. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Donaldson made the financial arrangements for cryonic suspension by 
naming a cryonic firm as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy. Thirteen 
years later he was diagnosed as having an inoperable brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 200 people have made the financial arrangements with Alcor for cryonic 
suspension and 16 are frozen, Mondragon said. The minimum cost is $35,000 for 
the preservation of a head and $100,000 for a full-body suspension.

Tom Fogerty, co-founder with his younger brother John of the highly successful 
1960s rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, has died in Scottsdale, Ariz., a 
spokeswoman for his record company said Friday. He was 48. 
</P>
<P>
Terri Hinte, of Berkeley-based Fantasy Records, said Fogerty died Sept. 6 of 
respiratory failure stemming from tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
The Fogerty brothers began playing music as junior high school students in El 
Cerrito, in Northern California. Their band used the names Tommy Fogerty and 
the Blue Velvets, Golliwogs and, ultimately, Creedence Clearwater Revival. 
</P>
<P>
The foursome sold more than 86 million records, with eight Top 10 singles and 
six gold albums. Among their hits were "Proud Mary," "Bad Moon Rising," 
"Travelin' Band" and "Green River." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Fogerty, the rhythm guitarist, left the band in February, 1971, saying he 
wanted to spend more time with his wife and children in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining members -- lead singer and guitarist John Fogerty, bassist Stu 
Cook and drummer Doug Clifford -- continued as a trio until disbanding in 
October, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Tom later worked as a solo artist, recording the single "Joyful Resurrection" 
and several albums. 
</P>
<P>
Fogerty is survived by his wife, Tricia, six children and four brothers.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
LUNGREN, SMITH CLASH OVER REPRESENTING STATE ON 2 ABORTION ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare joint appearance Friday, state attorney general candidates Dan 
Lungren and Arlo Smith clashed over whether, if elected, they would have the 
duty to represent the state in court on two controversial abortion law issues. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Smith, a staunch abortion rights activist, said he would refuse to 
represent the state if the Legislature approved a new law restricting public 
funding of abortions for the poor. The 11-year San Francisco district attorney 
also said he would probably not defend a 1987 state law facing court review 
that would require pregnant minors to obtain parental consent before having 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"Laws that would deprive the woman of the right to choose clearly violate . . . 
the California Constitution," said Smith, referring to the right to privacy 
provision. "The attorney general's obligation is to protect the Constitution 
and to protect the public's rights under that Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Lungren, a longtime abortion foe, agreed that both the state 
Constitution and case law clearly provide the right to abortions. But he added 
that neither rule out restrictions on teen access or Medi-Cal funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Arlo and I have a big difference here," said the former five-term congressman. 
"I mean, I am not a liberal Democrat. I don't believe because there's a right 
declared, that means that the state has an obligation to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
The Medi-Cal funding issue has come up frequently during the last decade, with 
the state Legislature repeatedly banning public funding, Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp defending the laws and the state Supreme Court concluding that they 
were unconstitutional. Two years ago, Van de Kamp refused to represent the 
state any longer. No funding restriction law is pending. 
</P>
<P>
As for teen access, Lungren called it constitutionally "defensible," but Smith 
said, "I would want to look at all the case law, (but) it probably is 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
The pair proceeded to debate how many public debates they should have at a 
breakfast session of the Friday Group, an organization of political 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Under the group's ground rules, TV cameras were excluded from the forum -- only 
the second joint appearance of the two candidates since Smith upset Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner in the June Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Before the primary, in which Lungren ran unopposed, the pair debated four 
times, in moderator-free, Lincoln-Douglas-style sessions. Days after, Lungren 
extended an invitation for a similar series of pre-election debates. Smith 
declined and said Friday his schedule provided limited time to meet Lungren in 
any type of forum. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Smith's campaign manager, Marc Dann, announced that Smith had 
reached an agreement to appear with Lungren on two 30-minute 
question-and-answer news conference programs -- on KCBS-TV and on KNBC-TV -- 
that would air Oct. 7, the same day as the first gubernatorial debate. 
</P>
<P>
A Lungren aide expressed displeasure with the format. Dann was pleased. "It's 
highly unusual," he said. "It's a debate-athon."

SOIL NEAR RECYCLING PLANT MAY BE TESTED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: OXNARD IS CONCERNED THAT LEAKING CHEMICALS FROM THE ORMOND BEACH 
FACILITY ARE CONTAMINATING NEARBY WETLANDS.

<P>
As part of a $1-million restoration project, the city of Oxnard may conduct 
soil tests to determine whether an aluminum recycling plant is leaking 
dangerous chemicals into the wetlands at Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment Director Steven Kinney said the restoration project probably will 
include soil testing around the Halaco aluminum recycling plant in the 6200 
block of Perkins Road. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the $1-million project in June when it adopted the 
1990-91 budget. The council will discuss the project and the soil-testing 
proposal sometime in the next three weeks, Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
If testing shows that Halaco has contaminated the adjacent wetlands, the 
council will be asked to direct a cleanup project, Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said Friday that she would support soil testing and 
the removal of the recycling plant from the site. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything to move that thing," she said, referring to Halaco. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Halaco has been the target of criticism by local environmentalists, 
who believe that chemicals from the plant are leaking into the wetlands, which 
are home to hundreds of species of birds and fish. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling plant includes a huge settling pond, which has spawned 
unsuccessful lawsuits by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the 
California Coastal Commission and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
However, none of the investigations preceding the lawsuits determined whether 
the plant endangers the wetlands, Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
Halaco Plant Manager Dave Gable said the plant, which melts down about a 
billion aluminum cans a year, complies with every requirement of state and 
federal environmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're an environmentally healthful group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, news that testing is being considered elicited cheers from 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy," said Jean Harris, an Oxnard resident and member of Ormond 
Beach Observers, a group dedicated to the restoration of the area. "I think 
that is a real positive move." 
</P>
<P>
Roma Armbrust, a Ventura resident who heads the group, said the Ormond Beach 
Observers requested such studies about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we made such an effort already, we therefore would definitely support 
soil testing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney said he is not sure how much the testing would cost, but said the 
council will be asked to hire a private firm to outline the necessary work 
needed to restore the area, which has been the home for several industrial uses 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money would go toward restoring a portion of wetlands near Arnold 
Road that has been devastated by off-road vehicles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the testing is to determine once and for all whether Halaco 
poses a danger to the wetlands, Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Halaco controversy surrounds its settling pond, where the plant 
dumps the byproducts of the recycling process, including dirt and aluminum 
oxide. 
</P>
<P>
Halaco's Gable said the settling pond was built on top of a huge deposit of 
clayey soil, which helps keep liquids in the pond from leaking. But even if 
there were a leak, Gable said that aluminum oxide is not harmful. 
</P>
<P>
"It comprises a major component of the earth's crust," he said. "So we are not 
putting anything new in there." 
</P>
<P>
However, Wayne Ferren, a biologist at UC Santa Barbara, said aluminum oxide is 
not completely safe. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain types of lead can be associated with aluminum," said Ferren, who has 
directed several field trips through the wetlands at Ormond. 
</P>
<P>
Ferren said he is happy to hear that Oxnard is considering testing near Halaco, 
which he called "the worst use of coastal habitat that I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Ferren oversees a saltwater reserve in Carpinteria and said development has 
eliminated almost all of the wetlands in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
He said testing near Halaco will put to rest many unanswered questions, and he 
suggested that the city also test "animal tissue to determine whether there is 
a possible contamination entering the food chain."

POLICE OFFER DECALS TO FIGHT AUTO THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning Sept. 28, Ventura city residents can register for a free voluntary 
decal program designed to fight auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
A bright 4-by-4-inch decal will be affixed to participants' vehicles, 
indicating to police that if the car is seen on the streets between 1 and 5 
a.m., when most auto thefts occur, police have reasonable suspicion to stop the 
car, said Russ Hayes of the crime prevention unit. 
</P>
<P>
"The sticker indicates to us that the owner has given police prior permission 
to stop the vehicle during the designated times and make sure that either the 
owner or someone with the owner's permission is driving the car," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is not limited to the city, and cars with decals can be stopped by 
any police agency anywhere in the state, he said. Ventura is the first city in 
the county to offer the Combat Auto Theft Program. Officials at the Thousand 
Oaks Police Department said they are planning to start the program soon. 
</P>
<P>
About one vehicle a day was stolen in the city of Ventura last year, Hayes 
said, and 253 vehicles have been stolen in the city so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fighting theft, Hayes said, the program may deter people from 
drinking and driving late at night because the possibility of being stopped is 
increased. And "moms and dads can tell their kids that they better not stay out 
past 1 in the morning because they'll probably get stopped, since the sticker 
is on the car," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Interested people can sign permission forms at the Police Department. MAJA

TRUSTEES OK REPORT ON 7TH HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the Oxnard Union High School District have approved an 
environmental impact report on the district's seventh high school, a step 
toward buying a 50-acre site in northeast Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The site, south of Gonzales Road between Oxnard Boulevard and Rose Avenue, is 
prime agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
The report notes that there will be "unavoidable environmental impacts" in 
turning such land into a school site, but because of high enrollment forecasts 
for three of the district's high schools, the board voted unanimously Wednesday 
to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1993-94 school year, the district projects that Oxnard High School will 
have a 174% jump in enrollment. Channel Islands High School will have an 
increase of 201% and Hueneme High School 163%. The newest district high school 
was built 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The land, in an unincorporated area next to the city limits, is inside the 
city's sphere of influence. It must be annexed to the city before development, 
said Robert A. Brown, district business manager. "We will attempt to purchase 
the land as soon as possible. If not, then we will take it by eminent domain." 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the property owners have submitted a development plan 
for 2,471 residential units and 66 acres of commercial use to the city. 
However, all recent city plans for the property have shown it as a school site, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed high school is planned to be operational by 1993. GERRY BRAILO

County prisoners would be used to remove graffiti on public property under a 
suggestion made by Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gillig said he would research the idea, adding that the city Parks and 
Recreation Department already has a contract with Ventura County to use 
parolees to help maintain city parks. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig said he is not sure how many parolees are involved in that program. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi, who is up for reelection in November, launched a war on graffiti last 
month, instructing city staff to draw up a plan of attack. 
</P>
<P>
In response to his request, City Manager Vernon G. Hazen recommended a week ago 
that the city offer a reward of up to $250 for anyone who reports and helps 
apprehend graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen also organized a meeting of representatives of several city departments 
to discuss the problem. One of the suggestions that resulted was to charge 
property owners for the cost of removing graffiti from residences and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Among other ideas for reducing graffiti, staff members suggested that the city 
adopt an ordinance banning the sale of aerosol paints to minors. 
</P>
<P>
Final consideration of all the recommendations will take place sometime in the 
next two weeks, city officials said. HUGO MARTIN

WORKER CRUSHED BY HIS STEAMROLLER

<P>
A 32-year-old Norwalk man, ending a workday of road repair in Simi Valley, was 
crushed and killed Friday by his steamroller when he jumped from the runaway 
machine, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Gonzalez, an employee of Imperial Paving Co. of Whittier, was pronounced 
dead at the scene about 3:45 p.m., said Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate of the 
Ventura County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez probably died of a chest injury, although an autopsy will be performed 
today, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and at least one other employee had finished work on Black Canyon Road 
in the Santa Susana area and were driving their steamrollers up the winding 
road to their vehicles, said Lt. Tony Ditzhazy of the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Ditzhazy said Gonzalez jumped from his steamroller after it had apparently lost 
power and began rolling backward down the slanting road. He said that Gonzalez 
was then struck by the steamroller and that a co-worker found the body in the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
The steamroller fell into the bottom of the canyon, Ditzhazy said. KIRSTEN LEE

LAX-PALMDALE MAGNETIC RAIL PLAN STUMBLES WITH CALTRANS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE AGENCY NAMES THE PROJECT AS AN ALTERNATE, BEHIND TWO ORANGE 
COUNTY PROPOSALS. KATZ CALLS THE REJECTION A 'POUR-CONCRETE MENTALITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed magnetic levitation rail line from Los Angeles International 
Airport to Palmdale, which had excited dreams of a commuter service connecting 
the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys to the Los Angeles West Side by 
1997, was left in limbo by Caltrans on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The state transportation agency named the project as an alternate, to be 
selected only if one of two Orange County projects fails. The agency instead 
chose highway proposals in Orange and San Diego counties and in Northern 
California to support under legislation authorizing free rights of way for a 
total of four private toll roads or railroads. 
</P>
<P>
This left Los Angeles political leaders and transportation officials 
disappointed and unhappy that the state's largest and most congested 
metropolitan area had been left without an endorsed project. They vowed to seek 
legislation that might authorize Caltrans to support additional projects later. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee, said angrily: "Caltrans cannot get away from a pour-concrete-only 
mentality. They chose four road projects and left out the only rail project. On 
top of that, to ignore a project in the largest county in the state and a 
project that is projected to move more people than any of the other projects is 
insulting." 
</P>
<P>
But Caltrans Director Robert K. Best said at a Sacramento news conference that 
one reason the maglev line ranked lower than the projects chosen was that 
Caltrans had been told operating costs might have to be subsidized by the 
government. Therefore, he said, it was uncertain whether it truly would be a 
private project. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Chiaverini, senior vice president of the Perini Corp., said, however, 
he still hopes Caltrans will eventually decide to support it. Perini leads the 
consortium, which includes the firm of Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; Mendenhall 
and the HSST Corp., that had proposed the 80 m.p.h. maglev line. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been chosen the first alternate to the Orange County projects ahead of 
two other projects," he said. "My wife said no to me the first time I proposed 
to her, and that didn't discourage me . . . . Being named in some fashion is 
encouraging, and we've got to wait to find out what those ramifications mean." 
</P>
<P>
In a magnetic levitation system, trains are propelled by electromagnetic forces 
on a slight cushion of air. The lack of friction between the guideway and the 
train allows high speeds at comparatively low energy expense. 
</P>
<P>
Chiaverini said the Perini consortium will not decide what to do next until it 
confers with the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Consortium spokesmen have said the first 36-mile stage of the line, from the 
airport to Santa Clarita, would cost a little over $1 billion, with fares of 
about $10. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, they acknowledged, a public operating subsidy might be required for 
the first 15 years. Later, county officials said they understood the subsidy 
could run $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Chiaverini said Friday that officials of the consortium had told Caltrans that 
it should still support the project because all construction costs would be 
private, and public funds subsidize most railway operations anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Linda Bohlinger, director of capital planning and programming for 
the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, said local officials still 
think "this is a viable project." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to find out now how we could go ahead," she said. "It's not been 
absolutely turned down." 
</P>
<P>
Bohlinger said that the projects chosen must work out franchise agreements with 
Caltrans by December, and there could be problems. Katz said he understood 
substantial public opposition exists in Orange County to one of the proposals 
approved there -- extension of the Highway 57 freeway in a toll road down the 
bed of the Santa Ana River toward Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Even if one of the Orange County projects does not fall by the wayside, there 
is always the possibility of persuading the Legislature to act on behalf of the 
maglev line, Bohlinger said. "At least, we'd like them to make the right of way 
available," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, however, expressed concern that Perini may soon decide to drop its 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Vallee Bunting, said, "Despite 
today's decision, we are hopeful that the merits of this new transportation 
system will encourage Caltrans to take another look at the LAX-Palmdale maglev 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"Maglev trains are the mode of public transportation for the future and will 
alleviate the congestion presently plaguing Southern California highways," she 
said.

<P>
The president of a now-defunct swimming pool company in Newbury Park has been 
indicted by the Ventura County grand jury on suspicion of misappropriating 
construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Nelson Buratti, 62, of West Hills will be arraigned on nine felony and 
two misdemeanor counts Oct. 2 and could face up to six years in prison and a 
$10,000 fine, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
John L.Geb. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1987 and June, 1989, Buratti ran Blue Haven Pools West, a franchise 
that contracted with homeowners to build swimming pools, Geb said. Buratti is 
accused of charging homeowners for subcontractors' work and never paying the 
workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By diverting the payments, Buratti is suspected of costing homeowners a total 
of $40,000 because they had to repay the subcontractors, Geb said. KIRSTEN LEE

ABSENCES MAY LEAD TO SCHOOL ON SATURDAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Paula High School students who cut class will find themselves going to 
school on Saturday under a new attendance policy. 
</P>
<P>
School officials started the new policy this year because 15% to 20% of the 
students were tardy and 6% to 10% were absent each month last year, said 
Assistant Principal Fran Meek. 
</P>
<P>
The district receives about $16 a day for each student from the state and loses 
the same amount for each unexcused absence, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten teachers met over the summer to work out the new policy, which puts the 
responsibility for attending school on the student, said Assistant Principal 
Dax Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
On the first infraction, the student will have a conference with his teacher. A 
second absence will be punished by an hourlong detention and a telephone call 
to the student's home. The third time, the student will be referred to the 
assistant principal and assigned to Saturday school, Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
If the student does not show up for Saturday School, an in-school detention 
will be assigned, he said. Detention duty requires teachers to give up their 
preparation periods to monitor the students, but teachers have volunteered to 
do it, Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
The final disciplinary step would be in-school suspension, which Bryson 
described as closely monitored detention. The advantage of in-school 
suspension, he said, is the school still receives its regular share of funds 
from the state because the student is on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers have gone over the rules with students and copies of the new 
regulations have gone home to the parents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is plenty of fear and trembling and gnashing of teeth" on campus, 
teacher Basil Augustine said. "I now see students leaping toward their 
classrooms when they hear that bell." AMELIA CHAFFEE

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUBMISSION OF DUMP AGREEMENT IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city sanitation officials said Friday they would delay taking to 
the City Council a civil agreement with regional air quality officials to 
reduce methane gas emissions at Lopez Canyon Landfill in northeastern San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached this week between the city and the enforcement staff of 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, was to have been submitted 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But those who oppose the dump's operations said there was insufficient time for 
public comment on the document and its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and residents who live near the landfill 
also asked that the district delay presenting the agreement to the council 
until the AQMD hearing board, which also must approve the document, finishes 
examining it. The hearing board has been conducting hearings into excess gas 
emissions at the dump since April. 
</P>
<P>
"Why, after all this foot-dragging, the sudden rush?" Katz asked. "If the 
agreement is a good one, it will stand up to public scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
AQMD chief prosecutor Diana Love said Friday she will meet with residents of 
Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon, where the dump is located, before 
submitting the agreement to the council in October. 
</P>
<P>
The public also will be given an opportunity to testify before the hearing 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to install additional emissions controls will cost the city 
several million dollars. The city also faces civil fines for violating state 
air pollution laws at the dump. The amount of the fines, which could total 
$700,000, has not yet been determined, Love said.

A 41-year old Van Nuys woman was killed when her car collided with a 
tractor-trailer truck in Sherman Oaks on Friday afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Fariba Solhjoe died at UCLA Medical Center, said Officer Michael Brausam. The

Beverly Glen Boulevard, a quarter-mile north of Mulholland Drive. "She veered 
left over the double yellow lines" and "went underneath the tractor-trailer 
rig," Brausam said. 
</P>
<P>
The front of Solhjoe's 1980 Nissan Sentra was run over by the left rear wheels 
of the truck.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER CONVICTED IN MAN'S SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury Friday found a 19-year-old Arleta woman guilty 
of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder for driving a car 
used in a drive-by shooting in which a man was killed and his girlfriend 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated nearly three days before finding Karen Argott guilty in 
the death of Odilon Gonzalez, 23, of Pacoima and the attempted shooting of his 
girlfriend, Irma Ortega, 21, of Van Nuys, on Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also convicted Argott of a felony charge of shooting into an occupied 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven to 16 shots were fired at Gonzalez and Ortega as they drove west on 
Oxnard Street near Van Nuys Boulevard, police said. Ortega was cut by flying 
glass but escaped serious injury when Gonzalez pushed her to the floor of the 
car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who previously had been identified by authorities as Odilon 
Navarette, was shot in the back, both arms and head, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Shellie Samuels, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant was issued for Walter Oswaldo Barillas, 23, of Sepulveda, who 
prosecutors allege fired the shots at Argott's behest. Barillas remains at 
large, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels said Argott asked Barillas to shoot at the couple in retaliation for an 
earlier incident in which her windshield was broken by bottles outside a 
birthday party for Ortega's sister. Samuels said Ortega did not take part in 
the bottle-throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unusual drive-by-shooting where it's not the shooter who had the 
motives. It's the driver," Samuels said. "But I think she was as culpable as 
the shooter in the case. The driver had the motive and the driver went and got 
the shooter and brought him to the scene." 
</P>
<P>
Argott's defense attorney, Ralph Peretz, contended that there was no proof that 
his client was driving the car.

AROUND THE VALLEY BY SEBASTIAN ROTELLA : HER AIM IS TO ARM WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are monsters out there. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Paxton Quigley bought a gun. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Quigley wrote a book titled "Armed and Female. Twelve Million 
American Women Own Guns. Should You?" 
</P>
<P>
Quigley, a firearms expert, self-defense instructor, mother of two, part-time 
bodyguard, writer and lecturer brought her crusade to the Desert Inn in 
Lancaster this week. 
</P>
<P>
Arm yourselves against the night, Quigley told a spellbound audience at a 
seminar sponsored by The Gunshop Inc. in Lancaster. She brings a message 
well-grounded in statistics, news stories, garish true-crime programs and 
hysterical voices on the 911 line: For women in the United States in 1990, the 
night lasts 24 hours a day. The troops are in the Persian Gulf, but the war -- 
with daily body counts and 2-year-old-victims -- is right here. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have finally realized that the police can't protect them, their husbands 
can't protect them, their boyfriends can't protect them," Quigley said. "There 
is more and more crime. There is a change in attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Quigley has built a one-woman industry on this theme. Her presentation is 
slick. The cover of her book shows her in a fashionable V-neck blue dress, red 
ear protectors and gold bracelets as she holds a revolver at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
Like her press clippings, the 38-year-old with big, startled eyes and a 
master's degree in anthropology describes herself as "petite and attractive." 
She says you would not expect her to own a 9mm Lady Smith semiautomatic pistol 
or to speak the arcane language of recoil and isosceles firing stances. 
</P>
<P>
That's the point. At the heart of her pitch lies a personal conversion. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated guns," Quigley told the Antelope Valley crowd, which hails from an 
area where people grow up around guns, own lots of them and often announce 
their allegiance to them on bumper stickers. "I feared guns. I was actually 
anti-gun." 
</P>
<P>
Quigley's views grew out of a liberal political upbringing and solidified after 
the assassination of Sen. Robert Kennedy in 1968, while she worked in Kennedy's 
presidential campaign, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But her gun control activism faltered, she said, after her house was 
burglarized, her car was stolen as she watched and two friends were raped. She 
learned to shoot. She embarked on a research project that took her around the 
country to hear the stories of victims, cops, self-defense experts, inmates at 
San Quentin staring from the other side of the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Now Quigley teaches self-defense, charging $125 for two-hour lessons at gun 
ranges in Van Nuys and Orange County. She recommends the .38-caliber special 
revolver with a three-inch barrel for beginners because of its "excellent 
intimidation value" and moderate weight. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach them to shoot from the prone position, I teach them to shoot 
weak-handed," she said, absently tearing at the edge of a newspaper as she 
talked. She jumped up to demonstrate how she instructs her students to "walk 
and shoot, they love the assertiveness of that." 
</P>
<P>
Quigley, a National Rifle Assn. member and promoter, told the crowd that 
carrying a gun without a permit is illegal and carries awesome 
responsibilities. But she said 250,000 "law-abiding" Californians break the law 
daily, and there are modified purses and "fanny packs" to help them do it. Fear 
transcends ideology when it comes to the broadening spectrum of gun owners, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I could never understand why it ended up being a conservative issue," she 
said. "Liberals are always pushing for the First Amendment. I don't see why 
they fall down when it comes to the Second Amendment," which defines the right 
to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the audience, some with husbands in tow, listened intently to the 
pros and cons of Mace, stun guns, knives and Ku-batons, plastic sticks attached 
to key rings that enable the holder to slash and stab with the keys. 
</P>
<P>
The woman laughed, some of them a bit nervously, at scenes in a video of women 
using combat techniques to rip and stomp mock assailants in protective padding. 
They joined in enthusiastically when Quigley asked them to practice a 
resounding, angry "No!" of the type to be shouted at would-be "perpetrators." 
</P>
<P>
"As middle-class people we are bought up to be nice," she said, stressing that 
attitude is the foundation of self-defense. "Women are brought up to be 
especially nice. . . . It's hard for them to practice for something that could 
be horrible." 
</P>
<P>
The audience was silent during an audiotape of a frantic phone call to police 
from a Kansas City woman as a man broke into her house, an example of how the 
students should not be -- defenseless, no gun, no "safe room" with reinforced 
door, no recourse. A teen-age blonde, who had been sitting next to her sister, 
got up and left. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion veered from political denunciations -- tough restrictions on 
concealed-weapon permits leave gun owners "defenseless," a man exclaimed -- to 
legal questions about when it is permissible to shoot an intruder. The law 
looks favorably on a woman who uses deadly force, Quigley said, but you are not 
supposed to shoot them in the back. 
</P>
<P>
A thin, dark-haired woman in a business suit announced calmly that two years 
ago she had been abducted from a coin-operated laundry and raped. She referred 
to the color-coded hierarchy of mental states that Quigley had outlined: white 
for a comfortable, unalert state, with awareness increasing through yellow and 
orange. Finally comes the red zone in which you make decisions, run, attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the white zone," the woman said. "I wasn't ready. I was in my own 
world." 
</P>
<P>
She thanked Quigley and the others and left. 
</P>
<P>
At a table staffed by employees of the gun shop, a line of women formed to sign 
up for shooting lessons: New arrivals in the red zone.

A PLEA FOR THE TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excess tree trimming is going on in the West Valley, where they are cutting 
over 70% of healthy branches for no reason at all. I understand that if a tree 
presents a hazard, it should be taken care of, but this is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
When I called City Hall and spoke with the person in charge of the project, he 
told me that there is not much that he could do, because these so-called "tree 
trimmers" (I'll call them "tree killers") are private contractors and they have 
to cut as much as possible to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
So, who is in charge? How can we stop them before they destroy the beauty of 
our trees and deprive us of shade on our sidewalks? 
</P>
<P>
The city should use the money to plant trees, not to kill them.

Imust disagree with Debra Cohen ("Plug for Light Rail," Aug. 25) that a

The Blue Line trains have been equipped with VERY loud air horns, which are 
sounded with traditional long-long-short-long blasts at each grade crossing.

Ms. Cohen is invited to try to carry on a conversation or watch television in a

<P>
Hats off to the Newhall School District parents for their willingness to make 
personal sacrifices in order to provide a new, much needed, school for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
If these parents can manage this monumental task, maybe there's a money 
management lesson to be learned by the state of California. Every community 
deserves the same caliber school the Newhall School District will have. Wake 
up, California. Where are your priorities?

FIREWORKS ISSUE TO BE PUT BEFORE VOTERS IN CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in Carson will be asked in November whether the city should ban a 
traditional Fourth of July feature: fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory question, placed on the Nov. 6 ballot by the City Council this 
summer, asks whether the sale of so-called safe and sane fireworks should 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Safe and sane fireworks refer to those permitted under state law unless cities 
or counties ban them. They include sparklers, smoke "snakes," cone-shaped 
fountains that spout multicolored sparks and "party poppers" which emit paper 
streamers with a satisfying pop. Nonprofit charitable organizations, which 
market the fireworks to raise money, are allowed to sell the items from June 28 
to July 6. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition F pits the fireworks industry and charity organizations against 
opponents, especially public safety officials, who are concerned about the 
potential for fireworks-related fires. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, Inglewood and Lawndale are the other South Bay cities that allow 
safe and sane fireworks. Most recently, the Lomita City Council prohibited 
sales and use in 1986 after voters endorsed a similar advisory measure against 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
This past summer, 28 charitable organizations in Carson sold fireworks to raise 
money for their various programs, netting an average of $4,000 to $5,000 each, 
according to city officials. Business license and application fees connected 
with the sales earned the city $4,200.

MOORPARK'S TAYLOR TO MISS OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bryant Taylor, one of the Moorpark College football team's top recruits, will 
miss the opener against East L.A. today and perhaps the season because of high 
blood pressure, Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting a little late," Bittner said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't make it out by next week, we'll probably call it a season. It's 
frustrating because there are no answers. They don't know what's wrong with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
A standout running back and linebacker at Oxnard High, Taylor (6-2, 210) 
tentatively had been moved to linebacker full time by the Moorpark coaches but 
had been held out of preseason practice as a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
Bittner said Taylor has continued to undergo medical testing every two days. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Taylor's blood pressure has been lowered through medication but 
that efforts to find the cause of the condition have produced nothing 
conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"He still wants to play, but until they find out what's wrong, I won't feel 
comfortable," Bittner said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was a two-year Times All-Ventura County selection, once at linebacker 
and once at running back. BRENDAN HEALEY

Hoover 21, South Pasadena 20 -- Halfback Alex Dixon's 82-yard touchdown 
reception from quarterback Rene Gabri late in the fourth quarter gave Hoover 
the victory at South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The play overshadowed the performance of South Pasadena quarterback Eric Shear, 
who completed 17 of 21 passes for 171 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover rushed for just four yards but relied on the arm of Gabri (10 of 22, 217 
yards, two touchdowns) and the leg of David Bronner, who kicked two field goals 
in the first half. ADAM BENSON

Channel Islands 30, Hueneme 19 -- A fourth-quarter comeback by Hueneme fell 
short and Channel Islands' Pharoh Milner scored on a 40-yard run on the last 
play of the game at Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands (2-0) used a strong ground game to build a 24-7 lead after 
three quarters, but Hueneme quarterback David Andrade completed 13 of 18 passes 
for 113 yards and a touchdown in the second half to lead his team back. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings cut the deficit to 24-19 when Rex Barrios scored on a seven-yard 
run after taking a pitch from Andrade with 3:20 left before Milner put the game 
away with his long touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Renard Carn of Channel Islands, who rushed for 197 yards and three touchdowns 
in last week's season-opener, left the game late in the second quarter with an 
ankle injury after gaining 46 yards in seven carries. MIKE BARTLETT

VENTURA EDGES NEWBURY PARK, 21-20, ON 68-YARD PASS ON GAME'S FINAL PLAY

Newbury Park High controlled the clock, but Ventura dominated the highlight 
film after beating the host Panthers, 21-20, on a last-second, 68-yard 
desperation pass. All three of Ventura's scoring plays were of 53 yards or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
With six seconds remaining, Ventura quarterback Jeff Dietz lofted a long pass 
to Tommy Ruelas, who caught the ball and was tackled as he fell over the goal 
line. After a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was marched off against 
the rejoicing Cougars, kicker Trevor Rumsey booted a 35-yard extra point that 
hooked just inside the right upright as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
The last-second heroics were set up by junior defensive tackle Chris Haynes, 
who pounced on a Newbury Park fumble at the Ventura 42-yard line with 55 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park (0-2) had a three-to-one advantage in time of possession during 
the first half, but Ventura (2-0) stayed close with a number of big plays. 
Ventura running back Derek Swafford burst up the middle on a 70-yard scoring 
run in the second quarter to give the Cougars a 7-3 lead. Dietz, from his 
defensive back position, picked up a fumble and raced 53 yards for a score and 
a 13-10 third-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Swafford finished with 119 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park running back Dave Roberts rushed for 126 yards and one touchdown 
in 22 carries. GREG MEADE

AS TEEN LIES DYING, 2 ROBBERS FLEE WITH THE BOOTY -- BURGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

As a South Los Angeles teen-ager lay dying in a mini-mall parking lot, holdup 
suspects robbed him of his $3.10 cheeseburger meal early Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Velos, 17, and a younger brother had just bought two dinners and returned 
to their car when two men demanded money and the food, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
When Velos refused, one of the suspects shot him, his brother said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and police, however, were unable to find a bullet wound. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a thin trickle of blood coming from his mouth," said Detective Richard 
Simmons of the Los Angeles Police Department. "He might be shot in the mouth 
and the wound is not visible." 
</P>
<P>
At least two witnesses besides 14-year-old Antonio Velos said they heard a 
single shot, and one of the other witnesses saw a gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 2:30 a.m. outside Tam's Burgers, a restaurant in 
the 4300 block of South Figueroa Street. Velos' family said he and his brother 
were returning home from a party and stopped to get something to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Richard G. Santiago said the brothers bought their food and had 
returned to their car when two men -- one of whom had a gun -- approached the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The men demanded money, and receiving none, demanded the food, said the 
detective. Antonio Velos told investigators he heard the gunshot after his 
brother pushed one of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then reached inside the car, police said, and grabbed the two bags 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Velos bolted and ran back to the restaurant, he said, as the suspects 
fled, apparently on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Velos was pronounced dead at California Hospital about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of the two youths, Margaret Dozier, sat in her tiny apartment above 
a storefront Friday with a roomful of relatives. They tried to make sense of 
what happened to Jesus, a Los Angeles High School student who was the father of 
a 13-month-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
"The police said he could have had a heart attack from the sound of the gun, 
but he has never been sick," said his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus lived with an older sister and came to his mother's house only late at 
night, the family said, because he was afraid of being attacked by members of 
the Bloods street gang who claim the mother's neighborhood as their turf. 
</P>
<P>
Dozier acknowledged that her son was a member of the rival Crips gang, but said 
he had been forced to join several years ago when the family lived in a 
different neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"They told him he couldn't live there if he didn't join," said Dozier. 
</P>
<P>
When the other gang members found out one of Jesus' relatives had been a 
well-known gang leader, she said, they exempted him from initiation rites that 
often include requirements to commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in the gang, but he didn't gang bang," Dozier said. "He was a good 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago said police are operating on the assumption that Jesus was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was shot, it was a small-caliber gun," said Santiago, "but then he may 
not have been shot." 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy, not yet scheduled, will determine the cause of death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were investigating the possibility that the suspects were 
involved in a robbery in the same parking lot a few hours before Velos died. 
</P>
<P>
If it turns out that Velos was shot in the mouth, his family said that would be 
a tragic coincidence. A cousin who was like a brother to Velos was killed by a 
gunshot to the mouth two years ago in Pomona, the family said.

MONTEREY PARK FIRE SCORCHES 4 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four expensive hillside homes in Monterey Park -- all with wood shake roofs -- 
sustained moderate damage Friday when an arson-suspected fire scorched 15 acres 
of parched brush and palm trees in a well-groomed residential area. 
</P>
<P>
It took 150 firefighters nearly two hours to control the blaze, which began 
about 12:20 p.m. at the base of a hill near the intersection of Crest Vista 
Drive and Cadiz Street. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by water drops by a Los Angeles County helicopter, firefighters beat back 
the flames, which threatened other homes on Rodman Circle, the cul-de-sac where 
the four homes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park Fire Chief Al McComb said the other homes on Rodman, valued from 
$500,000 to $750,000, were spared because they had tile roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"The moral, and we've been preaching it for years, is that a wood shake roof in 
a brush-fire situation is going to burn," McComb said. "There's no two ways 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the brushy terrain west of Atlantic Boulevard was a prime area for a 
devastating fire because of drought conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said a municipal work crew was nearby when it spotted flames 
coming from at least two different locations on a hillside overlooking 
Atlantic. The fire quickly moved uphill, damaging the four homes. 
</P>
<P>
One Rodman Circle resident, Shiro Ito, said he was on his way to lunch when he 
saw flames threatening his red-tile-roofed home. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my animals -- three cats and a dog -- and got out of there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
A tenant of one of the damaged homes, who declined to give his name, said he 
was called at work and told the house was damaged. "We're going to have to call 
the Philippines and tell the owner about the fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McComb said arson appeared to be involved because of eyewitness accounts that 
indicated the fire might have started in two or three different places near the 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate cost estimate on the damage.

SCHABARUM BLASTS DEUKMEJIAN FOR 'LACK OF EFFORT'; 
</P>
<P>
INITIATIVES: SUPERVISOR CRITICIZES GOVERNOR'S TENURE DURING LAST SEVERAL YEARS. 
MEANWHILE, SUPPORTERS OF PROPOSITIONS 140 AND 131 LAUNCH CAMPAIGNS TO LIMIT 
TERMS OF LEGISLATIVE AND STATEWIDE OFFICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum on Friday blasted the record of 
Gov. George Deukmejian as unimpressive and proof of the need to limit terms of 
legislators and other state elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's unexpected cannonade against his fellow Republican came after a 
press conference called to launch the campaign for Proposition 140 -- 
Schabarum's term-limit initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor said that Deukmejian, whose career in public office spans almost 
28 years, is unlikely to support the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I talked to Duke, he was not supportive of this (initiative)," 
Schabarum told a Times reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a career guy, as I am," said the supervisor, who put in five years in 
the state Assembly before his 18 years on the county board. "I don't agree with 
him on a lot of things, including his lack of effort in the last three or four 
years. I don't think he has a terribly impressive record, which again makes my 
point, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian would not respond to Schabarum's sweeping criticism Friday. The 
governor has not taken a public position on either of the term-limit 
initiatives on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, consumer advocate Ralph Nader and supporters of another 
term-limit measure, Proposition 131, officially kicked off their campaign by 
predicting a national movement to limit legislative terms. 
</P>
<P>
There is "a tremendous surge of public support all over the country for limits 
of terms," said Nader, citing somewhat similar measures on the ballot in 
Oklahoma and Colorado. "This is the beginning of the drive for 
citizen-legislators, not lifetime legislators." 
</P>
<P>
Backers of Proposition 131 emphasize their measure's provision for public 
financing of state political campaigns, unlike Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of both initiatives complain of the influence of special-interest 
groups and campaign contributions on state decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
A target for both camps is Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
whose powerful position has enabled him to tap special interests to raise money 
for Democratic incumbents and -- more recently -- for the campaign to defeat 
both term-limit initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Brown argues that the term limits are anti-democratic and would play into the 
hands of "sleaze-ball" special interests who would have an easy time swaying an 
inexperienced crop of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of both initiatives picketed Brown's lavish fund-raiser Thursday 
night at the Beverly Wilshire. Hundreds of lobbyists, businesses and trade and 
professional organizations paid $1,000 a plate for dinner and a show featuring 
the Temptations. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the evening, Brown expressed his annoyance with the picketers. 
</P>
<P>
"As you leave here tonight, drive carefully," he admonished the crowd, adding, 
"but I don't give a damn if you hit the pickets." 
</P>
<P>
Backers of both 131 and 140 charged that the Speaker had twisted arms to 
persuade lobbyists and others to attend the fund-raiser and to discourage 
financial support for the term-limit initiatives -- charges emphatically denied 
by a Brown aide. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the two initiatives say they expect to be heavily outspent by 
opponents, who hope to raise $5 million for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum said that he will be actively involved in fund raising for the 
campaign. He conceded that he would try to tap into some of the same 
special-interest sources that he complains about. He is planning a $500-a-plate 
fund-raiser next month. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to fight fire with fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum acknowledged that a term limit at the local level would have 
curtailed his tenure on the county board, but said he would nonetheless support 
one. Asked if he might introduce a county term-limit measure for his colleagues 
to consider, he said: "No. Those guys think they are the lifeblood of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Two competing term-limit initiatives are on the Nov. 6 ballot. Proposition 131, 
authored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Common Cause, would limit most 
state-wide elected officials to eight consecutive years in office, senators and 
Assembly members to 12 years. Proposition 140, pushed by Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, is more stringent, limiting lifetime service for the 
Legislature to eight years in the Senate and six in the Assembly. The Schabarum 
initiative would also cut legislative spending and retirement benefits. The Van 
de Kamp-backed measure would for the first time provide public matching funds 
for state political races.

PLUMBERS DISCOVER CASH FLOW PROBLEM IN SEWER; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTERFEITING: PHONY $100 BILLS ARE FOUND CLOGGING CAL STATE LONG BEACH LINE. 
SECRET SERVICE AGENTS BELIEVE 'MONEY' MAY HAVE BEEN PRINTED ON CAMPUS.

<P>
Campus plumbers investigating a clogged sewer line climbed down a manhole and 
found about $1 million in sopping wet, counterfeit $100 bills stuffed into a 
pipeline beneath Cal State Long Beach, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Secret Service agents said they were looking into the possibility that the 
money originated on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"It just looked like a bunch of bills floating on top of a mass of green mush," 
said Ron Perron, field operations lieutenant for the campus police department, 
summoned to the scene Thursday by plumbers. "It's a very difficult medium to 
work in because you're dealing with (waste) intermingling with all the 
currency." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Vann, a custodian who witnessed the discovery, said, "It was just a big 
glob." 
</P>
<P>
Secret Service agents said they recognized the currency as having come from the 
same lot as about 10 bills that were spent in Long Beach area restaurants and 
retail stores during the last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively poor quality of the currency, they said, led them to speculate 
that whoever fabricated the cash was inexperienced in counterfeiting money. 
Investigators said the counterfeiter probably decided to dump the bills after 
running into trouble passing them off as authentic. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that they decided it was (unacceptable) and tried to destroy it," 
said George Franklin, assistant to the special agent in charge of the Secret 
Service's Los Angeles office, where the bills were taken for storage. "I'd say 
they got pretty frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Secret Service agents interviewed campus police, but had not spoken to 
students, Franklin said, nor did they have any suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The sewer line where the money was found, Perron said, is connected solely to 
drains in bathrooms in two engineering buildings on the north end of the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators theorized that the bogus money was either flushed down one of the 
engineering buildings' toilets or dropped into the sewer through the manhole, 
located on a fairly well-traveled campus road. 
</P>
<P>
University officials said that the engineering buildings are open to students 
and faculty from early morning to late evening. They contain classrooms and 
laboratories related to the fields of environmental, thermodynamics, mechanical 
and civil engineering -- none that require equipment capable of printing or 
duplicating counterfeit money. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on campus, the story is different. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all the equipment to do it," said Armando Archuleta, a custodian 
familiar with the campus. "We have computers, printing machines, paper. This is 
a city in a city." 
</P>
<P>
University spokeswoman Toni Beron confirmed that some equipment capable of 
being used in the production of phony money exists on campus. There are laser 
printers and a printing press in the design department of the School of Fine 
Arts, as well as process cameras and offset presses in the graphic arts 
program. Beron said that because the equipment is used all the time, it is 
"hard to imagine how it could be used for illegal activities." That opinion was 
shared by university President Curtis L. McCray. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of dumbfounded," McCray said. "I suppose it could have been someone 
here, but I find that hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
Many students and staffers Friday seemed unaware that their university had been 
the site of a major discovery of counterfeit money. As word slowly spread, some 
jokingly referred to each other as counterfeiters and laughingly talked about 
the state of the university's budget, which is facing a potential cut this year 
of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the state cut our budget all they want," quipped Alicia Franz, a secretary 
in the engineering department. "We'll just make our own money." 
</P>
<P>
At the Secret Service office in Los Angeles, investigating agents faced a more 
immediate problem: finding a volunteer to count sodden currency. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish you could see this," Franklin said. "It's pretty pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
The green glob of money, which weighs about 40 pounds, will end up in a vault 
in Washington for use as evidence, Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that this guy will do it again. If he has the plates, he can make 
more of these bills. He'll work on it a little more and then he'll get 
caught."COUNTERFEIT MONEY FOUND 
</P>
<P>
Campus plumbers at Cal State Long Beach discovered about $1 million in 
counterfeit money while they were investigating a clogged sewer line. The 
Secret service is looking into the matter. Its investigation focused in part on 
the two campus buildings highlighted below 
</P>
<P>
1. Engineering Building 3 and Engineering Building 4 are the ohly structures 
serviced by the clogged sewage line where the money was found. Investigators 
were studying the possibility that the money was flusehd down toilets in one of 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
2. The counterfeit money was found by campus plumbers under a manhole near the 
two engineeering buildings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SETTLEMENT OKD FOR KIN OF SLAIN STORE 
MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials Friday agreed to pay the lion's share of a 
$130,000 settlement to the family of a jewelry store manager who was mistakenly 
shot and killed by a sheriff's sharpshooter during a 13 1/2-hour hostage siege 
in Beverly Hills in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The County Claims Board approved the settlement of a lawsuit filed by the 
family of Hugh Skinner, manager of the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels store who was 
mistaken for a gunman who earlier had killed two hostages during a botched 
robbery attempt at the Rodeo Drive store. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner, 63, was slain as suspect Steven Livaditis attempted to escape from the 
store using three hostages as shields, according to a report by Assistant 
County Counsel S. Robert Ambrose. Livaditis, who pleaded guilty to the murder 
of Skinner and two other store employees, is on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
The payment was among $363,500 in settlements approved Friday involving seven 
lawsuits against the Sheriff's Department.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LINDSAY HAS SURGERY TO AID HIS BREATHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve days after suffering a stroke that left his right side paralyzed, Los 
Angeles City Councilman Gilbert Lindsay underwent a tracheotomy Friday to aid 
his breathing, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, 89, remained in the intensive care unit at Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital in Inglewood, where he was taken on Sept. 2 after collapsing at his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokeswoman said his condition remained stable and good. 
</P>
<P>
The tracheotomy was performed in an attempt to remove Lindsay from a respirator 
to which he has been connected since entering the hospital, said Bob Gay, an 
aide to Lindsay. Doctors attempted to remove the respirator on Wednesday, Gay 
said, but Lindsay began choking because of fluid buildup. 
</P>
<P>
The tracheotomy will allow insertion of a tube intended to keep fluids out of 
the windpipe.

2 DEPUTIES, EX-OFFICER CHARGED IN BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two Orange County sheriff's deputies and a former Maywood police officer were 
charged in Los Angeles Friday with beating a Maywood jail inmate into 
unconsciousness while the three men were off-duty and drunk from attending a 
bachelor party. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed six felony counts 
against Deputies Ivan Budiselich, 26, and John Rice, 25, and Officer Michael A. 
Elliott, 31, who was forced to resign from the Maywood force over the March 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Each is accused of beating and threatening to hang Marino D. Martillo of 
Huntington Park. The incident, prosecutors said, occurred shortly after the 
officers left a colleague's bachelor party and went to the Maywood station in a 
chauffeur-driven limousine. 
</P>
<P>
"All were under the influence of alcohol and they entered the police station so 
they could use the Breathalyzer in order to determine which one of them was the 
most intoxicated," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey D. Oscodar, who is handling 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Budiselich, Elliott and Rice each were charged with one count of assault under 
color of authority and one count of assault and battery with serious bodily 
injury. Assault under color of authority, which can only be filed against law 
enforcement officers, carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison. The 
assault and battery charge has a maximum punishment of four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The officers are scheduled to surrender Monday at their arraignment in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney representing Rice and Budiselich declined comment Friday, saying 
he has not yet reviewed the case. But Martin Geragos, Elliott's lawyer, said 
the allegations are unfounded and that his client would be vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the officers showed up at the Maywood station about 2 
a.m. on March 23 to visit friends and play with the department's Breathalyzer. 
At the station, Oscodar said, Officer John Hoglund told the defendants that he 
had arrested a man in a red T-shirt who had argued with him and forced him into 
a chase in which his police car was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, the defendants then posed as district attorney's 
investigators and entered the jail to look for the man in the red T-shirt. When 
they asked him to come forward, Martillo, who was in jail on traffic warrants, 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
The officers then allegedly choked, kicked and hit Martillo until he was 
unconscious. One officer, Martillo recalled, pinned him to his bunk and said 
that if he did not stop harassing and complaining about officers they would 
"hang me and make it look like a suicide." 
</P>
<P>
It was later determined that Martillo, although dressed in a red T-shirt, was 
not the man whom Hoglund had arrested.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 13 ARRESTED AT PROTEST OVER EL SALVADOR 
POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen people protesting U.S. policy in El Salvador were arrested after a 
mass protest that stopped traffic and created a blocks-long jam in West Los 
Angeles Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The 3 p.m. protest, outside the office of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) at 
Santa Monica and Sepulveda boulevards, drew more than 100 protesters who 
demanded that Wilson oppose aid to El Salvador, said an organizer, Neile 
Rissmiller. 
</P>
<P>
Eight men and five women were arrested and released on $250 bail, police said. 
The demonstration, organized by the Committee in Solidarity with the People of 
El Salvador, shut down the eastbound lanes of Santa Monica Boulevard and tied 
up traffic on nearby freeway ramps.

NEXT GENERATION OF BACKS WILL CARRY ON;

<P>
FOOTBALL: GROUND GAME AGAIN IS ON SOLID FOOTING IN RUN-HAPPY LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
East Valley League teams typically feature strong running attacks and this year 
should be no different, considering the league's roster of talented 
ballcarriers. 
</P>
<P>
The league lost its heavyweights with the graduation of Sylmar's Jerome Casey 
and Grant's Marlowe Lewis and Shawn Booker. But all four of the league's teams 
-- Poly and North Hollywood are the other two -- have potentially high-profile 
running backs. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood's Leon Gable and Poly's Jonathan Campbell are at the forefront 
of the returning running backs. Gable, a scatback at 5-foot-7 and 145 pounds, 
is expected to average 30 carries a game, according to Coach Fred Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be the offense," Grimes said. "We will try to throw more, but only to 
get the ball to him in different places." 
</P>
<P>
Gable rushed for 1,081 yards and 10 touchdowns last year after missing the 
first four games of the season because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not real big, but he has ankles like a racehorse and that's what tweaked 
him last year," said Grimes, who has been making sure that Gable's ankles are 
wrapped every day. 
</P>
<P>
Poly has the league's largest and most productive running back in Campbell, a 
5-11, 190-pound senior who was the third-leading rusher in the City Section 
last year. Poly likely will keep the ball on the ground, and Campbell is the 
main reason. He rushed for 1,159 yards and 11 touchdowns last season. Only 
Kennedy's Ontiwaun Carter and Sylmar's Casey were more productive. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who rushed for 1,447 yards and scored 26 touchdowns last year, will be 
missed, but don't feel sorry for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar has the league's only returning quarterback in senior Danny Terry, who 
passed for 663 yards and six touchdowns last year. Terry is expected to run the 
option often; when he isn't running the ball himself, he probably will be 
handing off to junior Tobius Bookens (6-0, 170), whom Coach Jeff Engilman said 
is as fast as Casey. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bookens) has improved a great deal over the summer," Engilman said. "He is 
going to be a major-type running back. He'll surprise a lot of people this year 
and make people start to think about him." 
</P>
<P>
Even an average back would look extraordinary behind the strongest and most 
experienced offensive line in the league. Seniors Kenny Green (6-2, 235), Ezel 
Henry (6-1, 255), and Chris Schultz (6-0, 210) -- all of whom were all-league 
selections last year -- return. 
</P>
<P>
It might be a long season for Grant without quarterback Lewis and running back 
Booker. With them, Grant generated 3,070 yards in offense, third best among 
City Section schools and more than 500 yards more than any other East Valley 
League team. But Grant Coach Bill Foster is quick to point to those who will 
take up the slack, including senior tailback Tony Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"We as a coaching staff think (Johnson) is as good a running back as there is 
in the league," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who threw for more yardage than any other quarterback in the league last 
year (899 yards), has been replaced by senior Gerald Redmond (5-10, 165), a 
wide receiver last season. Redmond is expected to throw even more than Lewis, 
and his primary receivers will be senior Sargon Isaac (5-7, 145) and junior 
Eddie Moreno (5-7, 145).

PAST GLORY WON'T HELP AT THE COLISEUM TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
USC: PENN STATE COMES WEST OFF A LOSS. AND THE TROJANS' VICTORY OVER SYRACUSE 
HAD ITS FLAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first regular-season game between USC and Penn State, which will be played 
today before about 75,000 at the Coliseum, matches two of the winningest 
programs in college football. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, how good are these teams this season? 
</P>
<P>
A loss by the favored Trojans would negate the optimism generated by a 34-16 
victory over Syracuse two weeks ago at East Rutherford, N.J., where quarterback 
Todd Marinovich passed for a career-high 337 yards and three touchdowns but the 
Trojan running game was mostly ineffective and the defense seemed vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
A loss by Penn State would drop the Nittany Lions to 0-2 for only the second 
time in 25 seasons under Coach Joe Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State was uncharacteristically mistake-prone last Saturday in a 17-13 loss 
to Texas at University Park, Pa. Besides being penalized 13 times, the Nittany 
Lions were the victims of a blocked punt and a blocked field-goal attempt and 
an 88-yard return on the second-half kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play with much poise," Paterno said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they lost only after kicker Henry Adkins missed a 31-yard field-goal 
attempt with 5:16 left and quarterback Tony Sacca threw incomplete into the end 
zone on the last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
And though Texas drove inside the Nittany Lions' 15-yard line five times, the 
Longhorns scored only one touchdown -- after Adrian Walker returned the 
second-half kickoff to the Penn State six. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one respect, USC Coach Larry Smith said, the Penn State defense is 
no different this season than it has been in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just a bunch of hard-nosed, tough competitors," Smith said. "My 
general impression of the Penn State defense is, they just keep coming at you." 
</P>
<P>
The Penn State offense traditionally has relied on its tailbacks, including 
Blair Thomas last season. But last week the Nittany Lions were led by Sacca, a 
junior who passed for a career-high 243 yards, including 135 in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a great arm," Smith said of Sacca, who completed 13 of 32 passes 
against the Longhorns. "They have a lot of speed in their receivers, and he 
gets the ball down to them." 
</P>
<P>
Not consistently, however. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers regarded Sacca as the nation's No. 1 high school quarterback 
three years ago, but he has been erratic at Penn State, completing 39% of his 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
His completion percentage is in sharp contrast to Marinovich's, which improved 
to 63.5% in 13 games as USC's starting quarterback after he completed 25 of 35 
passes against Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as precise as anybody we've played," Paterno said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Syracuse, however, USC rushed for 100 yards, averaging 2.8 yards per 
attempt, its worst day on the ground since last season's opener against 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line graded out pretty well in the pass-protection department, 
and average to above average in the run department in the second half," Smith 
said. "In the first half, our run-blocking was terrible and our running game 
execution was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
That execution must improve today, said Smith, who described the Nittany Lions' 
defensive linemen as "big, rugged guys." 
</P>
<P>
They may be big and rugged, but like the Trojans, the Nittany Lions are young. 
Of the 86 players listed on the depth chart, only 11 are in their final season 
of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no delusions of grandeur with our present team," said Paterno, who has 
had four unbeaten teams and won two national championships at Penn State. "I'm 
disappointed -- any time you don't win, you're disappointed -- but I'm not 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a solid young team that, as I said prior to the season, might be a 
little overscheduled." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC has shuffled its secondary again. Marcus Hopkins and Stephon Pace are 
expected to be the starting safeties today, with junior Calvin Holmes and 
redshirt freshman Mike Salmon starting at the corners. . . . In the Trojans' 
opener against Syracuse, Hopkins and Howard McCowan were the starting safeties, 
and Pace and Marcel Brown were the starting cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
USC and Penn State have played twice. USC beat the Nittany Lions, 14-3, in the 
1923 Rose Bowl, and Penn State beat the Trojans, 26-10, in the 1982 Fiesta 
Bowl. . . . This is the first game of an eight-game series between the schools. 
They will play in the Coliseum again next season, then will play at University 
Park, Pa., in '93 and '94. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State lost its first three games in 1984 but rebounded to finish 8-4-1, 
including a 13-10 victory over Washington in the Aloha Bowl. . . . In the only 
previous meeting between the coaches, Joe Paterno and Penn State beat Larry 
Smith and Tulane, 9-6, in the 1979 Liberty Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State is 220-58-3 under Paterno, who ranks first among active Division I-A 
coaches in victories and second to Nebraska's Tom Osborne in winning 
percentage. . . . Penn State hasn't played in Los Angeles since Oct. 12, 1968, 
when it beat UCLA, 21-6, at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse had 333 total yards against USC, 142 running and 191 passing. Only 
Notre Dame had as much yardage against the Trojans last season. . . . Paterno 
compared USC quarterback Todd Marinovich to Brigham Young's Ty Detmer, who 
passed for 576 yards during a 50-39 loss to Penn State last December in the 
Holiday Bowl. . . . Penn State was 8-3-1 last season.

MELVIN DURSLAG: STUPIDITY IS THE MOTHER OF MAN'S EJECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG

<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Tanner, who managed the Chicago White Sox, Pittsburgh and Atlanta, used 
to lecture his players on the science of arguing a call. 
</P>
<P>
"If you tell the umpire he is a dirty . . . , the boot is automatic," Tanner 
said. "But if you say, 'If I was out on that play, I am a dirty . . . ,' you 
get the message to the ump, you get the grievance off your chest and you give 
him no case for throwing you out." 
</P>
<P>
The Tanner Theory obviously never spread, judging from the 152 ejections that 
have been recorded in the major leagues this year. 
</P>
<P>
And that figure is current through Aug. 31. Ejections are entered into the 
books at specified periods, like frequent-flyer miles. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, someone described as "personnel in uniform" is kicked out more 
than once a day. The Dodgers' Kal Daniels got it last weekend during a vital 
series with Cincinnati. It was in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
And his bat, very important to the Dodgers, was lost for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
A week or so before, something snaps within the cerebral turbine of Lou 
Piniella, manager of the Reds. He is inspired to rearrange the fixtures. He 
rips out first base and hurls it toward right field. 
</P>
<P>
Then, viewing the bag and deciding he doesn't like it where it is, he throws it 
somewhere else. You know the indecisions of decorating. 
</P>
<P>
So Lou is kicked out and, afterward, is red-faced and contrite. 
</P>
<P>
Those who populate baseball don't like to hear that they are the worst 
disciplined people in sports. 
</P>
<P>
They also reject charges that they are dumb, even though they understand fully 
what language will get them booted -- and they deliver those words anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Do baseball guys have arguments in their behalf? Mostly two. 
</P>
<P>
First, they claim their season is long and they are driven to the ledge by the 
pressures of competition. 
</P>
<P>
And their second argument concerns growing sensitivity, if not outright 
belligerence, of umpires. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to prove one time that umpires often reacted out of proportion to the 
stimulus, Billy Martin concealed a tape recorder inside his jersey and went to 
the plate to argue. 
</P>
<P>
A model of civility, uncharacteristically, he engaged in debate a militant 
umpire. He then submitted the tape to the league office. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know what happened? Billy was fined. The charge: He was out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
No one has since tried to nail an umpire on tape, but even if certain umpires 
flex muscles, you can't help but believe that the overwhelming majority of 
those they eject have it coming. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball guys are badly disciplined, often beginning in Little League. 
</P>
<P>
With moderate effort, one in the game is able to change. As a minor league 
manager, Tom Lasorda, for instance, posted a record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
He was removed from the first four games of a season -- all in the first 
inning. Players got up pools in the clubhouse, drawing for the innings in which 
Lasorda would be bounced. 
</P>
<P>
But bagging the Dodger job and informed that Walter O'Malley didn't care for 
managers who got kicked out, Lasorda quickly taught himself the art of 
restraint. He is given the foot today only infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
Television has created a problem for players and managers who burst their 
moorings. Games are taped and the tape systematically distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas in the old days a guy who went coconuts on the field was seen only by 
those in the seats, he is now watched by TV viewers throughout the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
In his base-throwing caper, Lou Piniella was seen on the 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock 
and 11 o'clock news. And he would be seen the next day on the 4 o'clock, 5 
o'clock and 6 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
And such showings will follow the poor man for maybe the rest of his life, 
because tape is forever. 
</P>
<P>
As manager of Philadelphia, Dallas Green suffered a moment of dementia on the 
field one night, going so far as to flick the cap from the skull of the umpire 
and kick it. He also jumped up and down like something suddenly unchained. 
</P>
<P>
So a year later it is announced that Green is moving into the front office of 
the Cubs and what do you see on tape? 
</P>
<P>
You see Dallas flicking off the cap of the umpire, kicking it and jumping up 
and down. 
</P>
<P>
But fear of embarrassment and acts detrimental to their teams don't seem to 
deter baseball guys from embarking on errands of lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
Those on the field appear determined to do something stupid, and they don't 
want anyone to stop them.

William Reedy testified in court in Port Crane, N.Y., that he did not drive the 
pickup truck in which Billy Martin was killed last Christmas but lied to 
officials to protect Martin, whom he claimed was driving. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit bar owner, accused of driving while intoxicated during the fatal 
wreck that killed Martin, choked back tears when recalling how the five-time 
New York Yankee manager did not respond after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to Billy, 'If you can get up, I'll push you out of the window,' " Reedy 
said of the crash's aftermath. "Billy's back was against the wall and his head 
slumped forward." 
</P>
<P>
Reedy, a longtime friend of Martin's, testified for 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In previous testimony, an FBI expert said that an analysis of the hair on the 
windshield of the truck appeared to show that Reedy was in the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Reedy faces a mandatory fine of between $350 and $500, revocation 
of his driver's license for at least six months and a possible jail sentence of 
up to a year.

The U.S. soccer team will play Trinidad and Tobago, the team the Americans 
defeated to qualify for the World Cup, today at High Point, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The United States' 1-0 upset of Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain last 
spring sent the team to the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
For the rematch, the rosters of both teams are depleted because some of the top 
players have signed with European clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The match will mark the return of forward Peter Vermes, who injured his ankle 
at the World Cup in June and has not played since. 
</P>
<P>
Another addition to the U.S. roster is Anton Nistl of Los Angeles. Nistl was an 
All-American goalkeeper at UCLA and played for the San Diego Nomads of the APSL 
West.

PHILLIES END METS' HOME WIN STREAK AT 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It figured that when the New York Mets' home winning streak ended, there would 
be a left-handed pitcher involved. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie left-hander Pat Combs held the Mets to four hits Friday night as the 
Philadelphia Phillies scored a 4-1 victory that ended the Mets' 11-game Shea 
Stadium winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets are 23-28 when left-handers start against them. 
</P>
<P>
Combs, ejected in his previous start at Shea on Aug. 9 when he hit Dwight 
Gooden with a pitch and precipitated a brawl, gave up a home run to Howard 
Johnson in the second inning but otherwise was in charge. The 6-foot-4 Combs 
(8-9) was leading, 3-1, when he hit Gooden to start the fifth inning in the 
previous effort. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies' Lenny Dykstra scored a run, drove in a run and regained the 
league batting lead at .336. Dale Murphy hit his 22nd home run and the Phillies 
beat Sid Fernandez (9-13), who struck out 12 in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, who had won four in a row, remained 1 1/2 games behind the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, who also lost, in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
Combs, 23, was 4-0 when he came up late last season. Four of his 12 victories 
have come at the expense of the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a letdown after beating the Pirates," said the Mets' 
Darryl Strawberry, who was hitless in four at-bats, striking out twice. "He 
just made some good pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Said Combs: "I am surprised. I didn't have it warming up. I was all over the 
bullpen. But from the first pitch I was good." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- There are two major factors keeping the Pirates 
from taking charge in the East. 
</P>
<P>
First is their inability to beat the Expos, against whom they are 5-11. The 
other is their inability to find a late-inning stopper. 
</P>
<P>
In a desperate move at Montreal, the Pirates brought starter Neal Heaton to try 
to save a 2-1 lead for Bob Walk. Walk gave up five hits in seven innings, 
didn't walk a batter and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton retired the first two Expos, but walked Delino DeShields. Tim Wallach 
doubled home the tying run and rookie Larry Walker followed with his 18th home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said he wasn't trying to hit a home run and the left-handed Heaton said 
he wasn't trying to throw a strike to the left-handed-hitting rookie. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to get him to chase a pitch in the dirt, but I got it up," Heaton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates' Barry Bonds hit two home runs and a double against rookie 
left-hander Brian Barnes, who otherwise was impressive in his debut. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 2, San Francisco 1 -- Mark Portugal (9-10) overcame early wildness at 
Houston to beat the Giants for the sixth time in seven decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal, who gave up four hits in six innings, walked five before being 
replaced by Juan Agosto. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Karl Rhodes doubled twice against Kelly Downs and scored both runs. The 
Giants fell to third and trail the Cincinnati Reds by 6 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal's 23 scoreless innings at the Astrodome ended in the fourth inning 
when Ernest Riles singled in the Giants' run. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Chicago 2 -- The Cardinals' new center fielder, Ray Lankford, had 
three hits and Pedro Guerrero doubled him home twice at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Cub shortstop Shawon Dunston was sidelined after suffering an injured left 
shoulder in a pregame fight with teammate Marvell Wynne. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 7, San Diego 3 -- Jim Presley doubled home the first of five Brave runs 
in the fourth inning at Atlanta and homered in the next inning. DAN HAFNER

BLUE JAYS PULL UNACCUSTOMED RALLY TO WIN, 8-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the Toronto Blue Jays' biggest problems has been their inability to 
rally in the last inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays scored three runs off Baltimore Oriole reliever Gregg Olson in 
the ninth inning Friday night at Toronto for an 8-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second time in 60 games Toronto has come from behind in its 
final at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Rance Mulliniks singled home two runs to tie the score, and John Olerud singled 
to win it and enable the Blue Jays to take a giant step in pursuit of the title 
in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Red Sox) must have looked up at the scoreboard, saw that we were 
down two runs with Olson pitching and must have felt pretty good," said 
Mulliniks, 7 for 16 as a pinch-hitter. "So they must have felt bad when they 
saw we pulled it out." 
</P>
<P>
Oriole Manager Frank Robinson was upset about the ball four call on Fred 
McGriff on a 3-and-2 count preceding Mulliniks' hit. "That was the play," 
Robinson said. "Everyone but the umpire knew it was strike three." 
</P>
<P>
Olson, who has had arm trouble recently, has 31 saves. This was his fifth 
missed save opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
With Boston losing, the Blue Jays are only three games behind with 17 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto, with Jimmy Key pitching hitless ball, led, 3-0, after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
But the Orioles scored six times in the sixth inning, four of the runs coming 
on Sam Horn's pinch grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Boston 0 -- Sammy Sosa hit a two-run home run and Jack McDowell 
(13-7) gave up only four hits in seven innings at Chicago. It was the second 
victory in a row for the White Sox over Boston, which has lost eight of its 
last 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox found that reliever Jeff Reardon wasn't ready to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon, in his first outing after back surgery Aug. 4, pitched only one-third 
of an inning, giving up two runs and four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 2, Milwaukee 1 -- Nolan Ryan gave up four hits and a run and struck out 
11 in eight innings and left with a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th inning, rookie Juan Gonzalez hit his fourth home run to win it for 
relief pitcher Kenny Rogers (9-5). 
</P>
<P>
Ryan extended his major league record to 14 seasons in which he has struck out 
at least 200 batters. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Detroit 2 -- Tim Leary (9-18) won in his bid to avoid 20 defeats, 
but the big news for the Yankees was a hit by Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly, out since July 24 with a back problem that has bothered him for two 
years, lashed a pinch double to celebrate his return. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 6, Kansas City 4 -- Sergio Valdez (4-5) gave up eight hits in 7 2/3 
innings at Cleveland, but he held hot-hitting George Brett hitless as the 
Indians won for the fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, who had climbed into a virtual tie for the batting lead, fell to .324, 
going 0 for 4. DAN HAFNER

DAMONE JOHNSON IS ACTIVATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As expected, the Rams activated tight end Damone Johnson on Friday. And in 
doing so, the team waived their right to use a two-week roster exemption for 
Johnson and -- to make room for him -- backup tackle Jeff Mickel. Mickel is a 
rookie free agent from Eastern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson ended his holdout Wednesday. In Tampa, where the temperature figures to 
be in the 90s, with very high humidity, he probably cannot be counted on to 
play more than 10-15 downs Sunday, and those will probably be during two-tight 
end sets on running plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I'm just going to play it by ear," Johnson said Friday. "I don't 
even think (the coaches) know. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be pretty hot, so I can't really say. You know, Tampa Bay is hot 
and humid, and a lot of things happen to you when it gets hot. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was pretty hot out here all week, and I didn't get tired." 
</P>
<P>
Don't count Coach John Robinson among those who fear that the two-time Super 
Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers will run away and hide in this year's NFC 
West race. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said this week that the NFC West race will be decided in the final 
four or five weeks of the season -- especially given the uneven play of the 
defending champion 49ers through the exhibition season and in their opener. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to stay close going into (the last five games) -- to me, that's 
still the key," Robinson said. "I think if the 49ers play like they're playing 
now and all through the preseason, they'll be a 10-6 team, no better than that. 
And I'm sure they would say the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
As pleased as the Ram coaches were with the play of rookie Bern Brostek in his 
emergency role as the starting right guard, they are happy that starting right 
tackle Jackie Slater is returning to solidify the right side of their offensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
With Slater out last week because of a dislocated toe, regular starting right 
guard Duval Love moved to tackle and Brostek, a center, played guard. 
</P>
<P>
"On our right side, between Duval and Brostek, you came away saying, 'They 
played good,' but there were about seven plays where something went wrong," 
Robinson said. "We ran a toss early in the game to Gaston Green, lost two 
yards, and we had everybody blocked. It was an eight-, 10-, 12-yard gain, 
except Brostek ignored the linebacker and the linebacker snuck behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Duval Love would've blocked him 10 out of 10 times. Those kinds of things, 
probably, with Duval and Jackie, we'll have very little of." TIM KAWAKAMI

The Raiders selected center Don Mosebar as captain of the offensive unit, 
linebacker Jerry Robinson as defensive captain and center Dan Turk as special 
teams captain. 
</P>
<P>
Turk replaced Stefon Adams, last year's special teams captain, who was signed 
by the Cleveland Browns after being waived by the Raiders.

Wide receiver Willie Gault was a member of a three-man team that set a track 
record Tuesday in the National Bobsled Push Championship at Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Gault teamed with Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses and Bubba Womack to post a record 
time of 5.18 seconds on one run. They won the three-heat competition in 15.68 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Herschel Walker of the Minnesota Vikings was originally on the 
team but dropped out because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Gault, a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic bobsled team, said his goal is to win 
a Super Bowl ring and an Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy, the Seattle Seahawks' No. 1 draft choice, will 
probably beplaying more Sunday against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The third player picked in the NFL draft, Kennedy was on the field for only 20 
plays during last week's 17-0 loss to the Bears in Chicago, after missing the 
exhibition season because of a holdout. CHRIS BAKER

DEREK SPARKS GRANTED ELIGIBILITY, BUT HIS COUSIN LELAND IS DENIED

Running back Derek Sparks has been cleared to play football at Santa Ana Mater 
Dei, the school announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing Sparks' official transcripts, CIF Southern Section Commissioner 
Stan Thomas said he was academically eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, one of the Southland's top running backs, left Van Nuys Montclair Prep 
last week and enrolled at Mater Dei Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said transcripts from Montclair Prep indicate Sparks had a grade-point 
average last spring semester lower than a 2.0 needed for eligibility. But he 
will be able to play because Mater Dei can put him on academic probation and 
give him one semester to improve his grades while he plays. 
</P>
<P>
Under Southern Section rules, a student on academic probation has one grading 
period to get off probation, and that period won't end until after the football 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Leland Sparks, Derek's cousin who also transferred from Montclair 
Prep to Mater Dei, won't be allowed to play football. His grade-point average 
was below a 2.0 for the past two semesters, meaning he didn't qualify for 
academic probation. 
</P>
<P>
Leland successfully petitioned the Southern Section for a fifth-year of 
eligibility this week. He will be eligible for spring sports if his grades 
improve. CHRIS FOSTER

HEARNS BREAKS LONGTIME KRONK TIE TO EMBARK ON VENTURE WITH SMITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If boxing has ever had an indivisible team, it was based at Detroit's Kronk 
Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Team Kronk. Its members weren't hard to spot -- in airports, hotel lobbies or 
fight arenas. Everyone was decked out in red and gold jogging suits and 
matching gym bags. 
</P>
<P>
And if any two Kronk members seemed inseparable, it was the team's founder, 
Emanuel Steward, and Kronk's top gun, Thomas Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
No more. Hearns has left Steward and Kronk for, believe it or not, Harold 
Rossfields Smith of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Hearns-Steward split isn't pretty. The breakup came amid name-calling and 
messy charges over money and alleged dishonesty. But then, in boxing, this is 
news? 
</P>
<P>
Steward accused Smith, the high-flying 1970s promoter who served 5 1/2 years in 
federal prison for embezzling $21.3 million from Wells Fargo Bank, of talking 
Hearns into leaving Kronk. In boxing, inducing a fighter to leave his manager 
is known as "buzzing." 
</P>
<P>
Steward said: "Harold came into town (Detroit) a few weeks ago, told me he had 
a possible TV deal for Kronk fighters and that he needed some money to put it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him $11,000. I put his hotel bills and his rental car on my credit 
card, and I loaned him $1,000 in cash, so he could have some walking-around 
money. I've got receipts for everything. 
</P>
<P>
"And the whole time, the . . . was two-timing me with Tommy behind my back." 
</P>
<P>
Steward said Hearns left over a difference of opinion on whether Hearns, 31 and 
a pro since 1977, should retire. Hearns wouldn't say why he left Steward, only 
that he "wasn't happy." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in favor of Tommy fighting again unless he could get another (Sugar 
Ray) Leonard fight," Steward said. "I got out the films of his fights since the 
(James) Shuler fight in '86, and I could see clearly the deterioration in his 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows I feel this way, and he disagrees. So now he talks only to Harold 
Smith. My attitude now (toward Hearns) is, 'Goodby, and good luck.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who will act as Hearns' adviser, had a markedly different version. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy came to me and told me he wanted me to handle his affairs," he said. 
"And he told Emanuel that, that he wanted to go out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"On Aug. 2, 1980, I promoted the show in Detroit (Hearns-Pipino Cuevas) that 
made Tommy a world champion. Ten years later, to the day, Tommy flew to L.A. to 
talk to me about my handling him. He knows he never would have got that title 
shot with Cuevas without me; Emanuel never could have done it. It took a 
tremendous amount of money to get Cuevas to fight Tommy in his backyard 
(Detroit)." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, years later, it might be questioned whose money was involved. The 
FBI said at the time of Smith's trial that the Wells Fargo case was the biggest 
bank computer fraud case in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the people I ever dealt with in boxing," Smith said, "I spent more 
money on Emanuel than anyone. Yet, during my period of incarceration, my time 
of crisis, he never contacted me once. I saw him at the Leonard-(Roberto) Duran 
fight, and all he said to me was, 'Hi, how ya' doin?' " 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rappaport of New York said he will promote Hearns' future fights. 
</P>
<P>
Many in boxing have urged Hearns to retire. His friends worry about his slurred 
speech. Since the 1986 one-round knockout of Shuler, he has seldom reminded 
anyone of the late 1970s and early 1980s welterweight who lit up boxing with 
numerous, sensational one-punch knockouts. Until he was stopped by Leonard in 
1981, Hearns had knocked out 30 of 32 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Recent shaky performances -- he was stopped by Iran Barkley in 1988 and seemed 
to have lost a lot in other appearances -- are due to unhappiness, Hearns said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't looked the same because I've been worried and unhappy; I haven't 
been able to give my all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of years, I haven't been happy. What Thomas Hearns wants to do 
now is give the people those kinds of performances he used to give." 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Mexico, Jorge Paez has gone into a prison camp-like 
setting to prepare for Tony Lopez in Sacramento next Saturday. He is said to be 
training in the mountains north of Mexico City, where there are no telephones, 
TVs or distractions of any kind. Further, only designated couriers can deliver 
messages to him. 
</P>
<P>
Forum regular Raul Perez, the World Boxing Council bantamweight champion from 
Tijuana, is a big favorite tonight to beat No. 1 contender Pepillo Valdez in 
Culiacan, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of new World Boxing Assn. welterweight champion Aaron Davis' 
fourth-round knockout of trial horse Billy Durbin in Minnesota Thursday 
described him as unimpressive. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended: Photographer Jim Britt's boxing photo exhibition, running through 
October at the Wiltern Theater Building in Los Angeles. Britt has photographed 
bantamweight Paul Gonzales extensively at 10 of his fights, and his pictures 
have captured the sport's grit and grime, as well as the prefight tension and 
anxiety. The exhibit, in the offices of Rachlin &amp; Rachlin Architects at 
3780 Wilshire Blvd., is open from noon to 5 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Shields, 34, inactive since 1983, was given a boxing license after being 
observed at a workout by commission official Dale Ashley.

4 HORSES COLLIDE AT LOS ALAMITOS IN FIRST RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chain-reaction collision marred the opening harness race Friday night at Los 
Alamitos when Lepton, undefeated in 1990 and the 1-5 betting favorite, went off 
stride in mid-stretch, stopped abruptly and was run into by three horses. 
</P>
<P>
None of the four horses involved in the wreck finished, leaving only Tracy's 
Comet and Black on Black to cross the finish line first and second. 
</P>
<P>
The show pool was divided between them, resulting in a record show payoff on 
Black on Black of $159.80. The huge payoff occurred because $23,299 out of the 
total show pool of $24,611 was wagered on Lepton. The prices for the winner, 
Tracy's Comet, were $43.80, $21.80 and $82.20; for Black on Black, $30 and 
$159.80. 
</P>
<P>
All four horses involved in the accident walked off the track. Drivers Ross 
Croghan (Lepton), Steve Desomer (Preciosa) and Rick Plano (Denali's Ginger) 
escaped serious injury. Kim Vincent (Magna Amber) was held in Los Alamitos 
General for observation with a severely bruised back.

Miss Budweiser, the defending national champion in unlimited hydroplane racing, 
regained the world closed-course speed record Friday when Tom D'Eath of Fair 
Haven, Mich., pushed the red boat to a lap at 167.224 m.p.h. over the 2 
1/2-mile Bill Muncey Memorial Course on Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The record run, during first-day qualifying for Sunday's Budweiser Cup race, 
beat the record of 166.759 m.p.h. set earlier in the day by four-time national 
champion Chip Hanauer of Seattle, in Circus Circus. D'Eath had held the mark of 
160.122 m.p.h., set July 1 at Evansville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
D'Eath also broke Hanauer's course record of 158.870 set last year in Circus 
Circus. Qualifying will continue today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. SHAV GLICK

FACES . . . : CHACONAS, CABLE'S KING OF TACK, BRINGS 'MR. PETE' TO THE MASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL WEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Chaconas started his television career on a dare from friends. 
</P>
<P>
Paying $35 per half-hour show, Chaconas signed up for the minimum nine-show run 
on Century Cable's public access channel in 1987, and launched "Take a Break 
With Mr. Pete." The Mr. Pete persona has gained wider exposure ever since, with 
appearances by Roseanne Barr and Steve Allen highlighting the cable program. 
Mr. Pete covered the Emmy awards show for a San Francisco TV station and the 
Zsa Zsa Gabor trial for Pat Sajak's defunct late-night talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Chaconas' first broadcast television program, "The Late Mr. Pete Show," airs 
Sunday nights at 11:30 on KTLA-TV Channel 5. The show, which runs for three 
more weeks, is a testing ground for Chaconas' goal of national syndication. The 
first attempt to sell it will happen early next year at the National Assn. of 
Television Program Executives' syndication marketplace in New Orleans. For 
Chaconas, the operative word in his public access career has been tacky. 
</P>
<P>
"The old shows are really incredibly tacky, which public access television is," 
he said. "It's just total tack. I just proclaimed myself the king of public 
access television, the king of all this tack." 
</P>
<P>
The KTLA shows, although slicker and free of the mistakes that made for "half 
the fun" of the public access shows, are consciously offbeat. The set is a 
garish mix of orange and checkerboard black-and-white, the house band plays 
zydeco music, and Mr. Pete wears a plaid dinner jacket, sunglasses and a bolo 
tie with his mustachioed face on it. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping to his pledge of being nothing more than a regular guy on television, 
he announces his address on the air and plugs the Authentic Cafe, where he 
still works as a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
"I get recognized all over town these days, and people tell me they feel I'm 
going to be famous," he says. "I get that all the time; it's a weird thing to 
have strangers say that. And it's a weird thing to be able to say about 
yourself." PHIL WEST

FACES . . . : FORGET SCHWAB'S, JAZZ PHENOM BROWN WAS DISCOVERED AT SCHOOL 
ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DOC ROBERTSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vernell Brown Jr. sat in at the piano one day last year for an absent friend 
during a Hamilton High School assembly called "Grammys in the Schools." Brown 
played so well that his talents were immediately recognized by the president 
and CEO of A &amp; M Records, Jerry Moss, who was in the audience. And now 
Brown has an album quickly making its way up the jazz charts. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about your fairy tales. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even scheduled to perform that day," says Brown, 19, who is 
represented by the William Morris Agency, has a contract with A &amp; M to 
record two more albums, just returned from a European tour and plays "Rhapsody 
in Blue" with the Southwest Community College Symphony Orchestra on Sunday as 
part of the L.A. Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's album is "Total Eclipse," produced by jazz musician Stix Hooper of the 
Crusaders. Brown composed all of the songs. The cut "August" was written in his 
dreams, he says. "I woke up one morning, heard most of the melody in my head, 
went to the piano and wrote it down." 
</P>
<P>
Composing music and recording albums is quite an accomplishment for someone 
who's only been playing the piano seriously for three years. Brown's fairy tale 
had a real-life beginning that started at age 4 with lessons on the piano as 
well as drums. The piano was not his favorite instrument so he concentrated on 
the drums until he was introduced to the violin as an 8-year-old. His 
instructor thought he was a natural violinist. He later became obsessed with 
the piano while attending the Los Angeles County High School of Performing 
Arts. From there, he transferred to Los Angeles' Hamilton High School Music 
Academy, where he graduated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Says Vernell: "I mainly concentrated on the drums until I was 16." DOC

ENTERTAINERS SWEETEN WALK IN GARDENS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ABOUT 15 GROUPS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT CULTURES WILL PERFORM IN DESCANSO 
GARDEN NOOKS FOR VISITORS WHO STROLL PAST TODAY AND SUNDAY.

Strolling entertainers are nothing new, but it is the audience that will do the 
strolling at Descanso Gardens during the Los Angeles Festival's closing weekend 
today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Performers will set up in nooks and crannies throughout the lush Los Angeles 
County park in La Canada Flintridge while the public circulates like diners 
sampling food from an exotic smorgasbord. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound will lead you through the gardens," said Patty Mannatt, special 
events coordinator for the county Department of Arboreta and Botanic Gardens. 
"Descanso Gardens has a lot of camellia trees that have grown into a camellia 
forest, and there are lots of little pockets that will hold 25 or 50 people who 
can stop and listen to a performer." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers opted for the unusual setup in part to give people a chance to see 
performers who have appeared at locations throughout the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups scheduled: the Chinese Classical Music Ensemble; Garba-Ras, 
Indian folk dancers who invite audience participation; the Nigerian Talking 
Drum Ensemble; the World Kulintang Institute, performers of gong music of the 
Muslim Philippines; Bibak, 130 performers from the Philippines; Los Pregoneros 
del Puerto featuring harp virtuoso Jose Pepe Gutierrez and Hawaiian dancer 
Randy Chang. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 15 groups are scheduled, including last minute additions like the 
traditional Bolivian music group, Miriam Mita and Ayllu Sankayo. 
</P>
<P>
Schedules of final times and locations of performances will be handed out at 
the park entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be something going on," said Peggy Riley, producer of the 
Descanso Gardens weekend. "It's very free-form. People can sit and listen, then 
move to a new place and hear something new." 
</P>
<P>
The park will open at 9 a.m.; entertainment begins at noon each day and ends at 
6 p.m., although Sunday's program is expected to run until dusk to mark the 
festival's closing. There are some benches, but most seating will be on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Music is presented every Sunday during the summer on the main lawn, but this is 
the first time that artists will play at various spots. Simultaneous 
performances raise the prospect of cacophony, but organizers said they expect 
no problem. The park, a popular wedding site with a waterfall, is large enough 
and the vegetation thick enough to keep the music from clashing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic and parking are not expected to present problems, either. Mannatt said 
that an annual garden festival attracts about as many people as are expected 
this weekend and that "people get in and out just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Festival organizers hope to draw 4,000 people each day. Descanso Gardens holds 
2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"If everyone came at the same time, we'd be in trouble," said Mannatt, "but 
that's not going to happen. People will be coming and going all day." 
</P>
<P>
Both Mannatt and Gail Boatwright, head of the Descanso Gardens Guild, a 
nonprofit support group, said no community opposition has surfaced to the Los 
Angeles Festival weekend. The guild sponsors all public events at the gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"We approve of what they're doing and we're cooperating," Boatwright said, 
adding that she does not fear damage by crowds to the garden's plants and 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
"That's quite a lot of people for the area, but we're hoping they'll be spread 
out throughout the day," she said. "There will be monitors to make sure that 
groups of people don't get too big." 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic food will be sold near the parking area and there are picnic tables 
nearby. Eating is permitted on the main lawn area but not in the rest of the 
park because it is a garden. Alcoholic beverages are prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $3 admission for adults, $1.50 for senior citizens and students, 
and 75 cents for children 5 to 12. Children under 5 are free.

CHINESE MUSIC STUDENTS AIM TO FORGE CAREERS IN THE WEST

<TEXT>
<P>
Xiao Wu, a former researcher, performer and teacher at the Shanghai 
Conservatory of Music, came to the United States as a graduate student in 
ethnomusicology at UCLA last fall. She does not intend to go back. 
</P>
<P>
"After June 4 (and the Tian An Men Square massacre), I wouldn't want to 
return," she said in Mandarin in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing to spend five or six years to earn a Ph.D, she hopes to get a job in 
music research after graduation, which will enable her to stay in this country. 
</P>
<P>
But she is worried that her goals may not be easy to attain because jobs are 
scarce in her field. "Music students here are worried about starving to death," 
Wu noted, facetiously. 
</P>
<P>
Not so in China. "Music graduates from reputable schools do not have to worry 
about getting a job, although their salary will be much lower because of the 
standard of living," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government allowed Wu to leave despite knowing she most likely will 
not return. She is not alone, she said: "Four out of seven in my graduating 
class (at the Shanghai institute) are in the United States. A fifth is in 
Germany." Wu left at her own expense -- her family helped to pay for her trip 
and a UCLA fellowship covers the cost of her studies. 
</P>
<P>
Studying English and doing independent research since her arrival on the UCLA 
campus in October, Wu, 29, was impressed with the university's resources and 
facilities for music research. 
</P>
<P>
Wu plays the pipa, a 2,000-year-old Chinese classical instrument. The 
pear-shaped, four-string pipa is comparable to the Western lute. Instead of 
using a bow, she will play two solos by attaching a fingernail-like substance 
to the fingertips of her right hand. 
</P>
<P>
She and three other Chinese classical musicians will perform in two free, 
outdoor concerts that the Los Angeles Festival is sponsoring in the Descanso 
Gardens from 3 to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Wu will play "The Ambush," a 2,000-year-old piece about how Emperor Liu Pung 
defeated his enemies, and "Gan-Hua-Huei" ("Flower Festival"), a Sichuan folk 
song. 
</P>
<P>
Erhu player Huaqi Han, 25, who was a principal performer on the sound track of 
the movie "The Last Emperor," will perform "Jian-He-Sui" ("Raging Waters"), in 
which a war widow tells her grief and anger to a river. "Many people cried 
while I played this piece in San Francisco a few years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With its sharp, sad tone, the 800-year-old, two-string erhu is particularly 
effective in expressing sorrow, said Han, a native of Beijing. The instrument's 
popularity and importance is comparable to the violin in Western music. But 
unlike the violin that is played while held in a horizontal position, the erhu 
is played upright with a bow. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfly harp player Zhi-ming Han, 35, who is completing a master's degree in 
Western composition at UCLA, will play two pieces: "I Love Taiwan Island," 
which he composed, and "Butterfly Loves," a traditional piece that he arranged. 
</P>
<P>
The first piece originated from a popular love song in Taiwan in the 1960s. 
"Although I've used some developmental ideas from sonatas, the composition has 
retained its Chinese folk music ecstatics," he said. The second piece is a love 
song between a young scholar and someone who he thought was his sidekick, but 
was actually a woman who dressed in men's clothes to get into school. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Shanghai who has been in the United States for four years, Zhi-ming 
Han said he was was pleasantly surprised by the immense popularity of his 
butterfly harp, or Yang-qin, in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
He has been asked to play the 600-year-old, 2-by-4-foot instrument in concerts, 
festivals, museums, art galleries, college classes, community functions, hotels 
and restaurants every week. "Although most Americans are not familiar with 
Chinese classical music, they like the sweet, melodious sound of butterfly harp 
that is similar to a harpsichord's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His career goal is to become a film music composer in the United States, as he 
was in China for five years. "I want to be a Western composer with a unique 
Chinese style, to introduce the Chinese heritage to Western instrumental 
music." 
</P>
<P>
A versatile musician, he will also play a bamboo flute solo, "Mongolia Melody," 
at the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Zheng player Hsin-Mei Hsiang, 25, a UCLA ethnomusicology graduate student from 
Taiwan, will perform "Melody of Qin-San" and "Dance of the Yi Nationality" on 
the 21-string, 2,500-year-old instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble will also be heard in duet, trio and quartet, playing such 
lighthearted tunes as "Happiness in the New Year," "Bubukao," "Purple Bamboo," 
and "Spring River and Flower in the Moon Night" -- a 20-minute ancient Chinese 
melody that describes breathtaking scenery by the waters.

<P>
Wilshire Boulevard Temple, one of the West Coast's largest synagogues, has sent 
a new, ground-breaking High Holy Days prayer book to its 2,500 member families. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Harvey Fields, the author and senior rabbi, said that by including 
photographs, the transliteration of Hebrew prayers and snatches of background 
information, the 430-page book is designed to be "worshiper-friendly" for 
congregants not well-versed in Hebrew and Jewish traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Fields estimated that at least half of his Reform temple's members can't read 
Hebrew other than a few expressions or prayers learned by rote. The rabbi said 
he knew of no other prayer book that frequently places transliterations (as 
well as translations) on the same page to let the reader to join congregants in 
reading Hebrew passages. 
</P>
<P>
Also unprecedented in a prayer book for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services, 
according to Fields, is the use of photographs, primarily of Jewish ceremonial 
objects, and the footnote-like explanations of prayers. 
</P>
<P>
The brief notes often give the biblical source, cite an appropriate rabbinical 
comment, or provide an interesting sidelight. For instance, a prayer said at 
the sounding of the shofar, which begins, "Out of the depths . . . " combines 
seven verses from Psalms and Lamentations. The verses are arranged in an 
acrostic -- the first letter of each Hebrew verse spells out a message, "Banish 
Satan." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Lewis Barth, a professor at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles, praised 
the worship book. "It tries to preserve some of the core elements of Jewish 
liturgy and yet make the Jewish worship experience accessible to people who 
have not had a lot of Jewish education," Barth said. 
</P>
<P>
Barth added that "some people might look at the explanations as something out 
of 'Trivial Pursuit,' but I really like it. It gives congregants extra 
information that connects them with the tradition." 
</P>
<P>
* STEEPLE 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Robert H. Schuller's Crystal Cathedral will dedicate its $5.5-million 
steeple and prayer chapel, designed by architect Philip Johnson, in 9 a.m. and 
11 a.m. services Sunday at the church complex in Garden Grove. The 
236-foot-high structure was named the Crean Tower after the donors of a major 
gift to complete construction. The 52-bell Arvella Schuller Carillon, named 
after the senior pastor's wife, will be heard for the first time at various 
times during the day, played by James R. Lawson, who retired last year as 
carillonneur of New York's famed Riverside Church. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a dissonant note was heard from El Cajon. The Door, a bimonthly 
evangelical/satirical magazine, gave its latest "loser of the month" award to 
the steeple. "This is not a monument to God, or even to Robert Schuller," the 
editors said. "This is a monument to Southern California, where wealth and 
materialism have become God, and where waste and insensitivity to the rest of 
the world are a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
* DATES 
</P>
<P>
Father Raymond E. Brown, one of the most honored U.S. Catholic biblical 
scholars, will inaugurate at 9 a.m. next Saturday a monthly series of lectures 
on the effect of the historic Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Author of 20 
books on the Bible, Brown retired in June from the Union Theological Seminary 
in New York City. The Vatican II lectures, sponsored by Mount St. Mary's 
College and held at its downtown Los Angeles Doheny campus, will cost $15 a 
lecture and $120 for the 10-month program. Other scheduled speakers include 
Catholic thinkers George Tavard, Margaret Brennan, Richard McCormick and 
Gabriel Moran. 
</P>
<P>
An eclectic, three-day "celebration for the Earth Mother" will begin Friday at 
the Institute of Mentalphysics grounds at Joshua Tree, 30 miles north of Palm 
Springs, with ceremonies and workshops led by Sun Bear, leader of the Bear 
Tribe Medicine Society, and others said to be versed in spirituality around the 
world. Donated food will be given to the Southern California Indian Center. 
Whole Life Productions of Playa del Rey is managing the event. JOHN DART

ROSH HASHANAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, will begin this year on Wednesday evening, 
launching Judaism's reflective Holy High Days, which culminate with Yom Kippur 
on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: The Jewish New Year is a solemn time in which each person's fate is 
said to be subject to review and judgment in the divine "Book of Life," thus a 
greeting in Hebrew that translates, "May you be inscribed for a good year." 
</P>
<P>
Central to services is the blowing of the shofar, or ram's horn, calling the 
assembled to repentance. 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVANCES: Selichot, or prayers for forgiveness, are part of the whole cycle 
of High Holy Day services and is the name of a pre-Rosh Hashanah service which 
will be held tonight at many synagogues. Rosh Hashanah services will be 
conducted in synagogues Wednesday night and Thursday, then on the second day in 
Orthodox, Conservative and some Reform synagogues. Some congregations observe 
tashlich, the custom of throwing crumbs into a stream or lake, symbolically 
casting one's sins into running water.

Orange County emerged the big winner Friday when Gov. George Deukmejian 
announced that it would receive two new private toll roads as part of a 
unprecedented effort in which entrepreneurs would be allowed to build and 
operate $2.5 billion worth of private expressways around the state. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Orange County proposals, made by a consortium headed by Texas 
computer magnate H. Ross Perot, is to build an 11.2-mile, $700-million elevated 
toll road in the middle of the Santa Ana River flood plain. It would link the 
Santa Ana Freeway near Anaheim Stadium with the Corona del Mar Freeway near 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The other proposal, by a team including CRSS Inc. and Citibank, is for a 
10-mile, $88.3-million toll road in the median of the Riverside Freeway, from 
the Costa Mesa Freeway in Anaheim to the San Bernardino County line. 
</P>
<P>
The completion date for the projects would be 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The projects were among four selected by state Department of Transportation 
after an unusual competition to see who could best plan, pay for, build and 
operate transportation projects before eventually turning them over to the 
state. The other two projects selected are in southern San Diego County and in 
a fast-growing suburban corridor east of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian hailed the winners of the competition Friday as part of a "historic 
public-private partnership" that would give congestion-weary commuters an 
alternative to overburdened public freeways. Tolls on the new roads are 
expected to range from 10 to 20 cents a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"While privatizing roads is not something totally new in the country, 
California's approach, I believe, is unique," Deukmejian said. "Rather than 
dictating which projects should be bid upon, we allowed the private sector the 
flexibility to go out and determine the projects that would best serve the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian won the right to take toll roads statewide last year in exchange for 
his support for a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans Director Robert K. Best also said that "there are a lot of economic 
incentives" for large landowners near the proposed toll roads to cooperate with 
the projects. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he had not realized before Friday that the winning proposals are 
all in heavily Republican areas. 
</P>
<P>
But that coincidence did not escape Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who 
said Caltrans' bidder selection showed "a pro-development-at-all-cost attitude. 
It's a Caltrans giveaway to Republican supporters." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's action was just the first step toward building the toll roads, giving 
the companies the right to negotiate with Caltrans. They still will have to 
seek local environmental and planning agency approval. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said he is upset that Caltrans passed over a proposal to build a 
high-speed, high-technology train system from Los Angeles International Airport 
to Palmdale. The project was the only one among seven submitted to the 
transportation agency under the privatization program that did not encourage 
the use of cars. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County deserved some extra consideration in the competition because 
its residents voted in June to support the 5-cent-per-gallon gas tax, the 
proceeds from which are being used to supplement the state's transportation 
budget, Katz argued. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County voted against the tax measure, which passed statewide 
nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
"We've definitely been screwed," Katz said of Los Angeles County voters. 
</P>
<P>
Also rejected was a proposal to rebuild San Francisco's Embarcadero Freeway, 
damaged in the Oct. 17 earthquake, and another Los Angeles-area entry, for a 
15-mile toll road through Simi Valley in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials hailed their two new proposed toll roads as crucial 
links in a freeway system overwhelmed with congestion but anemic in 
construction money. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been shocked if these two projects in Orange County didn't make 
it," said Bruce Nestande of Arnell Development and a member of the California 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's announcement brings to five the number of toll roads approved for 
Orange County, giving it the lead in private California roads. Two years ago, 
the Legislature grudgingly approved the first three such roads, which would 
serve southern Orange County. Construction and operation of these previously 
approved roads are locally controlled. 
</P>
<P>
The toll roads unveiled Friday would relieve two Orange County traffic 
pressure-points. One would cut through the heart of the county in the Santa Ana 
River flood plain, starting near Disneyland and Anaheim Stadium, through Costa 
Mesa and ending near the airport. The project would be built in conjunction 
with the Army Corps of Engineers, which is just beginning construction of an 
ambitious flood-control project along the river channel. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Erickson, attorney for the Perot group planning the project, said 
commuters can expect to pay $2.50 to travel the road's entire length. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Friday that the consortium now plans to ask Disneyland, Anaheim 
Stadium, large office towers and South Coast Plaza to chip in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to tell them," the attorney said, " 'If you want to get an 
off-ramp into your parking lot, there's some value here. . . . We may be able 
to put an off-ramp to your parking lot. Do you want to pay for it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said the proposed road could also tie into the Amtrak station near 
Anaheim Stadium, where the proposed California-Las Vegas high-speed train is 
expected to terminate. 
</P>
<P>
The other Orange County project would be a bid to deal with growing congestion 
on the Riverside Freeway, where thousands of commuters travel through newer, 
more affordable neighborhoods springing up in San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Tolls would range from $2 during peak hours to $1 during less congested 
periods; limited free access would be given to car pools, public transit buses 
and motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Other approved projects are: 
</P>
<P>
A 10-mile, $400-million toll road to be completed in 1995 from the Mexican 
border to California 54 through vacant land in southern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
A $1.2-billion, 40-mile toll road stretching from Sunol in Alameda County to 
Antioch, on the edge of Contra Costa County. The road would be the first phase 
of a proposed 84-mile loop through a fast-growing suburban corridor that 
stretches from Oakland to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Best, the director of Caltrans, said Friday that all of the toll projects would 
receive no state or federal money. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state could assist by condemning property, he said, the winning 
proposals are planned for existing public rights-of-way or are in favor with 
neighboring landowners. 
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the roads would be deeded over to the state, then leased back 
to their builders, who would have the right to charge tolls for the next 35 
years. Tolls would be set to guarantee a reasonable rate of return and would be 
changed only with state approval, Best said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the state would bail out a private project gone broke, Deukmejian 
quipped: "We'll let the next governor worry about that."

<P>
Two Orange County sheriff's deputies and a former Maywood police officer were 
charged Friday with beating a Maywood jail inmate into unconsciousness while 
they were off-duty and drunk after attending a bachelor party. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed six felony counts 
against Sheriff's Deputies Ivan Budiselich, 26, and John Rice, 25, and Michael 
A. Elliott, 31, who was forced to resign from the Maywood police force over the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Each is accused of beating and threatening to hang Marino D. Martillo of 
Huntington Park in March. The incident, prosecutors said, occurred shortly 
after the officers left a colleague's bachelor party and went to the Maywood 
department in a chauffeur-driven limousine. 
</P>
<P>
"All were under the influence of alcohol, and they entered the police station 
so they could use the intoxilizer machine in order to determine which one of 
them was the most intoxicated," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey D. Oscodar, who 
is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
Budiselich, Elliott and Rice each were charged with one count of "assault under 
color of authority" and one count of assault and battery with serious bodily 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Also filed were additional special allegations of great bodily injury, which 
could add up to three years to their sentences if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Assault under color of authority, which can be filed only against law 
enforcement officers, carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison. The 
assault and battery charge carries a maximum of four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The officers are scheduled to surrender Monday at their arraignment in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court. Oscodar said he will recommend bail of $30,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Paul DiPasquale, an attorney representing Rice and Budiselich, declined to 
comment on the charges, saying he had not yet reviewed the case. According to 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department, the two deputies have been placed on 
administrative leave pending the outcome of their criminal case and an internal 
affairs investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Geragos, Elliott's lawyer, said the allegations are unfounded and that 
his client would ultimately be vindicated. "Mike eagerly awaits the chance to 
clear his name," Geragos said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the officers showed up at the Maywood station about 2 
a.m. on March 23 to visit friends and play with the department's breathalizer, 
which is used to determine if someone is legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
According to the district attorney, Elliott, Budiselich and Rice had been out 
drinking and celebrating with a second Maywood officer, Daniel Vasquez, who was 
getting married the next day. 
</P>
<P>
At the station, Oscodar said, Officer John Hoglund told the defendants that he 
had arrested a man in a red T-shirt who had argued with him and forced him into 
a chase in which his police car was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, prosecutors charge, posed as district attorney's investigators, 
entered the jail to find the inmate in the red T-shirt and subsequently located 
Martillo, who had been jailed on outstanding traffic warrants. 
</P>
<P>
After telling Martillo's cellmate to bury his head under a pillow, the officers 
purportedly choked, kicked and hit Martillo until he was unconscious. One 
officer, Martillo alleged, pinned him to his bunk and said that if he did not 
stop complaining and harassing the officers, they would "hang me and make it 
look like a suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the attack continued for at least five minutes until it 
was broken up by a dispatcher, who feared that she could get into trouble for 
letting the officers into the cellblock. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Vasquez went to the station with the defendants but was not charged. 
Oscodar said the officer became ill from drinking and retired to a restroom 
while the alleged assault was taking place. 
</P>
<P>
It was later determined that Martillo, although wearing a red T-shirt, was not 
the man Hoglund had arrested. That man had put on another inmate's sweat shirt, 
which covered up his red T-shirt, Oscodar said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the victim's doctor and a physician hired by the prosecution, 
Martillo, 30, now suffers from blurred vision, hearing loss and dizziness as a 
result of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have done a lot to me," said Martillo, who works at Salute Auto 
Parts in Bellflower. "I don't know how all these guys got into law enforcement 
in the first place or why they have been allowed to stay. There are so many 
complaints against them, it is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Rice, Budiselich and Elliott first came under investigation in October, 1988, 
after they were involved in a brawl at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood, a 
popular rock club on the Sunset Strip. Four club employees were injured in the 
melee, but none of the officers, who were off-duty, were charged with any 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, a former deputy, joined the Maywood force last year after he was fired 
from the Orange County Sheriff's Department because of the escape of five 
prisoners from the Orange County Jail on Nov. 20, 1988. He had been assigned to 
supervise a roof exercise area from which the prisoners fled. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1989, his firing was rescinded, and Elliott was allowed to resign 
voluntarily with $8,000 in back pay to settle an accusation of unfairness 
during his disciplinary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union also had named Elliott and Rice in 
complaints alleging that they had used excessive force. None of those brutality 
allegations have been sustained, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy that charges have finally been filed," said Mario F. 
Vazquez, Martillo's attorney. "Fortunately, this was the type of incident that 
was so glaring and obvious that the authorities had to do something about it. 
My client was in jail and did not provoke anything."

In what may be the first ban in Orange County against the advertising of 
alcoholic and tobacco products in city parks, the city of Anaheim on Friday 
drew criticism for imposing such a restriction and forcing the cancellation of 
the city's first Mexican Independence Day celebration scheduled for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Diez y Seis de Septiembre (16th of September) celebration that was to be 
held at La Palma Park was called off after the sponsors, R.J. Reynolds Co. and 
the Adolph Coors Co., were told they would not be able to promote their 
products during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Although other Orange County cities prohibit the sale or consumption of 
alcoholic beverages at special events at their parks, Anaheim officials believe 
their city is the first to go a step further and prohibit promotional 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
While not directly involved in the planning of the festival at La Palma Park, 
the head of an Anaheim-based Latino business group blasted the new policy 
because it will affect future fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
Amin David, president of Los Amigos of Orange County, said the new policy -- 
not officially adopted by the City Council but imposed by the city staff -- 
applies only to city parks where fund-raising events are held, but not to 
Anaheim Stadium, the home of the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about this type of censorship and double standard," 
David said. "Why do we have free-flowing beer at Anaheim Stadium?" 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos participates in Anaheim's annual Cinco de Mayo celebration, with 
about half of the sponsorship dollars coming from R.J. Reynolds and Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
Without the ability to sell or market their products, there is no point in 
sponsoring the events, Coors marketing spokesman Jaime Velasco said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the beer business -- we have to sell beer," he said, adding that if 
the company cannot promote its product, then it cannot make the earnings that 
allow it to contribute to nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Coors marketing manager Mike Bobb also said the company spends about $1 million 
each year to co-sponsor events. By helping reduce the cost of staging 
fund-raisers, Bobb said, charitable organizations are able to raise additional 
dollars that go back into the community. 
</P>
<P>
"They (city officials) have isolated the beer and tobacco companies from being 
sponsors," Bobb said. "I don't know what that's going to attract. There are not 
too many sponsors to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Deven, city recreation superintendent, said the new rule is a "test case" 
that was based on previous discussions by council members who were concerned 
about co-sponsoring events with beer and tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
Deven said council members, who were aware this requirement would be imposed, 
may be asked to formally adopt the advertising ban. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems inappropriate to them, because the No. 1 violation of city ordinances 
that they see is the 'no-alcohol' ordinance in city parks," Deven said. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members were unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deven said the Diez y Seis de Septiembre celebration -- commemorating Mexico's 
call for independence from Spanish colonial rule -- coincidentally became the 
first event to come under the new restriction. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to making sure this event occurs in 1991," he said, adding 
that the promoter will be looking for other sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Deven said "someone else other than myself" would have to determine why other 
city facilities such as Anaheim Stadium are not subject to the advertising ban. 
"I am only concerned with the effect that these type of sponsors have on 
community parks," he said.

THOMAS F. RILEY TERMINAL OPENS TO TRAVELERS SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than five months after officials had hoped the day would arrive, Orange 
County's new and improved $310-million airport finally is scheduled to open at 
6 a.m. Sunday, giving travelers their first chance to use the cavernous new 
Thomas F. Riley Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old building that it replaces will close to the public tonight. 
</P>
<P>
New close-in parking lots, costing $1 an hour or $14 a day, will also open just 
after daybreak Sunday. The airport's remote lots, which had been scheduled to 
close, will stay open for at least the next 90 days, though the price will go 
up from $6 a day to $7. 
</P>
<P>
Where the old terminal had just a single level, the new facility features two. 
Departing passengers should head to the upper level, while arrivals and baggage 
claims will pull in below.

AIR TRAVEL: NOT ALL RECOLLECTIONS OF JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT ARE UNSAVORY. SOME

<P>
By most descriptions, it hardly seems like an airport a traveler would love. 
</P>
<P>
Lines from the airline ticket counters snake into corridors of cracked, 
speckled tile. Another line forms outside the only women's restroom downstairs. 
For the weary, there are few seats nearby. There are none at the snack bar, 
where the entire breakfast menu consists of doughnuts, coffee and orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
Once past the security checkpoint, passengers walk across a spotted, gray 
carpet to sit in tattered plastic chairs. They look out on a panorama of the 
airfield -- hulking airliners awaiting baggage, small planes taking off and 
landing, passengers trudging across the tarmac. The high-pitched whine of 
aircraft engines pours into the terminal and mixes with the sounds of flight 
announcements and babies' cries. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone who has been through the John Wayne Airport terminal in recent 
years will admit that the 23-year-old facility is cramped, noisy and outdated 
-- a far cry from the gleaming new terminal, 12 times bigger, that will open 
Sunday morning as part of the $310-million airport expansion. After all, the 
old terminal originally was designed to handle 400,000 passengers a year. In 
reality, 4.5 million a year squeeze through its tiny portals. 
</P>
<P>
But as the last hours of the old terminal draw to a close, some people say they 
would not trade it for any other airport in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I love flying in here," said Tim Hamilton, 41, a manager of commercial real 
estate based in Minneapolis, as he stood at the snack bar and stuffed a hot dog 
in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so convenient," Hamilton said. "You fly in, pick up your bags, walk a few 
feet across the street and get your rental car. Where else in the country can 
you do that?" 
</P>
<P>
It's an airport small and friendly enough that jets have been known to wait 
while a late passenger has run to catch a flight. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Sjolin, a manufacturing administrator for Coca-Cola in Houston, recalled 
this week that he once "got tied up in the bar" on the terminal's second floor 
as he waited for his flight to Las Vegas. Looking out at the airfield and 
checking his watch, he suddenly realized that his plane had already boarded, 
the door was closed and it was ready to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I literally ran to the plane. They pushed the ramp up to the plane and opened 
up the door again, just for me," said Sjolin, 41. "There were 100-plus-some 
angry people, all eager to get to Las Vegas and start gambling, who were 
looking at me when I got on. But a lot of other airports wouldn't have done 
that. They'd have said, 'Sorry, the doors are shut and we're gone.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Becky Anslynn of Dana Point got off her flight from Colorado this week, 
she and other passengers had to stand around while another jet pulled out onto 
the runway. But she did not mind in the least. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was just fine. Everything can't be slick," said Anslynn, 44, who 
will move her family to Aspen next month to escape the rapid growth of Orange 
County. "Everyone in their fancy clothes, holding their briefcases, had to wait 
for that plane to move. So what? Sometimes you have to sit back and wait. I 
realize the new terminal is necessary, and I'm sure it will be beautiful. But I 
like the older ways." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Spadoni, who has worked at the airport's cubbyhole of a gift shop for 
five years, also will miss the old terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"After five years, you grow attached," she said, selling someone a pack of gum. 
"That place" -- she nodded in the direction of the new terminal -- "will be so 
big and impersonal. Right here, everybody and everything is within walking 
distance. It feels like home." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even for those who say they love the old terminal, the transition has 
tested their affection. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the public telephone booths at the old terminal no longer have 
phones in them, and many of the ones that remain have "out of service" stickers 
plastered over the coin slots. The once-convenient public parking across the 
street from the terminal was eliminated earlier this year and the space was 
handed over to car rental companies. Since then the public has had to use a 
parking garage, a quarter mile away, that is part of the airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, it has been confusing to drive to the old terminal. Fluorescent 
orange traffic cones and construction dust line the airport entrance, and all 
the new signs directing traffic point the way to the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
And not everyone is sorry to see the old terminal close. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the junkiest airport I go to, and it's my home base," said James G. 
McWalters, a managing director of PM Realty Advisors, based in Newport Beach. 
On the shuttle bus from the old terminal to the new parking garage, he was 
asked if he had any nostalgia for the old facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Zero," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Ditto," added his colleague, Pete Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
"We catch a lot of planes, and the airport in Kalamazoo, Michigan, was better 
than this," McWalters said. 
</P>
<P>
Both are looking forward to the new $63-million terminal's extra space, 
streamlined check-ins for frequent fliers who are members of airline clubs, and 
especially the addition of "jetways" -- the covered passageways that allow 
passengers to get on and off the planes without trekking across the asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer said he will not miss the quaint walk across the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
"In bad weather, it's crazy, and an umbrella doesn't cut it," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical engineer Dawn Gregg of Santa Ana likewise has no fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disorganized, cluttered, crowded and unattractive," she said as she 
waited for her flight to Tampa, Fla. The new terminal "will be nice. It will 
give a more professional image to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
She realized that her return flight Sunday will deliver her to the new 
terminal. "That's great. So I get to say goodby to the old now and say hello to 
the new." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan McClung of Austin, Tex., 25, a J.C. Penney summer intern, was not 
displeased with the old terminal when he arrived at John Wayne Airport this 
week, only surprised. 
</P>
<P>
He had boarded his flight at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, a Texas-size, 
modern terminal. Landing in Orange County, he stepped off the plane onto the 
old-fashioned staircase pushed up next to the aircraft and walked to the tiny 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like stepping into one of those movies you see from the 1940s or '50s," 
he said. "It was kind of a shock."

NEIGHBORING CITIES VETO PARK RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition from the Fullerton and Placentia city councils has virtually killed 
plans to build a restaurant in Tri City Park that had the support of the city 
of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-acre park, which is actually within the city of Placentia, is managed by 
the three cities. A proposal such as one to develop a restaurant must be 
supported by at least two of the cities. 
</P>
<P>
Brea Councilman Wayne Wedin said the dissenting cities are missing out on a 
rare opportunity to get the land for the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The park is supported through federal funds, and commercial development of any 
portion within its boundaries is allowed only when an equal amount of land can 
be added to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal, which owns the Imperial Golf Course adjacent to Tri City Park, plans to 
develop its property into a residential neighborhood. Wedin said he is 
confident that Unocal, which must receive approval for the development from 
both Brea and Fullerton, would agree to deed to the park authority the two 
acres required by federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no other adjacent property that would be suitable for park 
use, the Unocal property represents the only opportunity for fulfilling the 
federal requirement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All Brea asked was, 'Should we look into this opportunity?' " Wedin said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Councilwoman Molly McClanahan, who also serves on the Tri City Park 
Authority, said the authority put out an invitation for restaurant proposals in 
1987 but received no response. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth exploring once and we did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McClanahan said Fullerton was also concerned that asking Unocal to donate land 
might jeopardize negotiations between Fullerton and Unocal on development of 
the golf course property. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of a restaurant at Tri City Park is an old one. An artist's 
rendering of the master plan shows a red circle designating a future restaurant 
site in the park's northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
Wedin was Brea's city manager when the restaurant was included in the master 
plan about 10 years ago. At that time, all three cities supported the idea of a 
commercial activity consistent with the park that would generate income for 
park maintainance. 
</P>
<P>
What was envisioned for the site was a "family-oriented supper house" 
overlooking the lake in the center of the park. The site is now a grassy area 
that receives little use, Wedin said. 
</P>
<P>
Wedin, who also works as an assets management consultant for various public 
agencies, said commercial use of public property is becoming a popular way for 
cities to raise money without taxing its residents. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

KIDS WEARING BIKE HELMETS REWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though some schoolmates call him "mushroom head," 8-year-old Jesse 
Alderman unabashedly straps on a neon green bicycle helmet whenever he mounts 
his bike. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom makes me," Jesse said Friday afternoon as he prepared to ride his 
bicycle home from Meadow Park Elementary School in Woodbridge village. "And I 
wear it because I like it." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse was one of six schoolchildren rewarded Friday by an Irvine traffic 
officer for resisting peer pressure and wearing a helmet. Officer Richard 
Worcester wrote out the six yellow tickets -- each good for a free order of 
french fries at Irvine McDonald's restaurants -- to reward the students for 
being safe. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's 10 traffic officers began issuing the tickets late last month as 
another prong in the city's attack on bicycle injuries and deaths. The officers 
have issued about 80 tickets so far. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the tickets, the city's Bicycle Helmet Awareness Program includes 
bicycle-safety instructions in the elementary schools and a doctor's outreach 
program that asks Irvine pediatricians and family practitioners to inform 
children about the importance of wearing a helmet when bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
Three Irvine bicyclists died this summer after accidents while not wearing 
helmets, Worcester said. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the tickets has been positive, Worcester said, although some adults 
have been upset initially that a police officer had pulled them over. Once, 
Worcester said, he used his loudspeaker to ask a man bicycling with his son on 
a nearby bike path to ride over to him. Both were wearing helmets. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing out of the father's mouth was, 'What do you think we did?' and 
the first thing out of my mouth was, 'I want to compliment you for getting your 
son to wear a helmet,' " Worcester said. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as you have this big smile on your face and they've realized they've 
done nothing wrong, that usually turns them around." 
</P>
<P>
The main problem with the ticket program is that officers haven't been able to 
spot many bicyclists with helmets, he said. "It's hard for officers to give 
them away." 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Daugherty, principal at Meadow Park Elementary, said students face stiff 
peer pressure not to wear helmets. Like Jesee, she said, they are called names 
chiding them for using a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Before school ended Friday, she pointed to a full bicycle rack outside the 
school and said that of all the students riding, only seven children wear 
helmets to school. 
</P>
<P>
Despite education programs at the school stressing the importance of helmets, 
most students still refuse to wear them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Helmets are vital because serious injuries from accidents decrease 
substantially for bicyclists wearing helmets, said Katherine Lyon, coordinator 
of the city's bicycle safety program. 
</P>
<P>
Three of every four bicycle accidents result in head injuries, Lyon said. A 
recent medical study found that helmets reduce head injuries for bicyclists by 
85% and brain damage by 88%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 38,000 children in the United States are injured each year while 
bicycling, yet studies show that only 2% of the them regularly wear helmets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most easily prevented accident," Lyon said. "Most kids don't think of 
their bicycles as vehicles. They think of them as toys and don't realize they 
can be killed. TOM McQUEENEY

RIDERS COMPETE IN ANNUAL HORSE SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Horse Show Assn. Championship Horse Show continues through 
Sunday at the Equestrian Center at the Orange County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Riders as young as 7 years old, as well as others up to age 17 -- amateurs and 
professionals alike -- will be competing for more than $15,000 in prize money 
and awards. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the competitors are from the Orange County area, although we do draw 
from as far south as San Diego and as far north as Santa Barbara," said Natalie 
Gilbert, who, with her husband, Jeff, runs Gilbert Equestrian Management Inc. 
in Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which will feature 350 horses, is in its sixth year, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Activities will run daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. On Sunday, riders will race 
against the clock in pairs and guide their horses over fences in the Santa Ana 
Feed and Saddlery/Eisers Rotating Rider Relay. That race begins at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:30 p.m., riders will compete for $4,000 in a high jump open to any class 
of rider. A bar will be raised in 6-inch increments until only one rider is 
left to clear the jump. 
</P>
<P>
Admission and parking are free. Those who attend should enter the Orange County 
Fairgrounds through Gate 5 off Arlington Drive. MARY ANNE PEREZ

A 6-year-old boy drowned in the shallow end of a swimming pool at an apartment 
complex Friday despite efforts by other swimmers to revive him, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Martinez, who could not swim, was wading in the shallow end of a pool at 
2200 E. Santa Clara Ave., accompanied by his mother, at about 5:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, they discovered he was missing. 
</P>
<P>
They found him lying in the shallow end of the pool," said Senior Deputy 
Coroner Richard McAnally. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to revive the boy were unsuccessful, and paramedics took him to 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he was pronounced dead less than two 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's parents were identified as Atapita and Jose Martinez of Santa Ana. 
The family was visiting relatives at the apartment complex, authorities said.

Police, working on an informant's tip, raided a 22-year-old woman's motel room 
and then her Encinitas home and seized about 20 pounds of methamphetamine and 
$80,000 in cash, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It was second methamphetamine bust in Buena Park in the past two days, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest raid occurred about midnight Thursday when investigators stopped a 
driver on the Riverside Freeway who had a small amount of the drug. After 
interviewing the driver, investigators were led to a motel room in Buena Park 
rented by Julia Anna Clark. 
</P>
<P>
When investigators searched Clark's room, they found a small amount of drugs 
and $43,000 in cash, police said. Officers then obtained a warrant to search 
Clark's Encinitas home where they found 20 pounds of methamphetamine and an 
additional $37,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was arrested on suspicion of possession of methamphetamines with the 
intent to sell and was being held in Orange County Jail on $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated investigation earlier Thursday, narcotics officers raided a 
methamphetamine laboratory set up in a Buena Park house, seizing between 5 and 
10 pounds of the drug and arresting a Riverside man, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
That raid capped a three-week investigation involving Brea police and the state 
Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the laboratory was capable of making of 25 pounds of 
methamphetamine worth an estimated $250,000 on the street. 
</P>
<P>
James Scigliano, 26, of Riverside was arrested on suspicion of manufacturing 
methamphetamines after investigators found him hiding in a closet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
During the raid, investigators wore special suits and gas masks for their 
protection while handling potentially toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory equipment was seized in addition to the drug and chemicals, police 
said.

ANAHEIM MAYOR REVERSES VOTE, OKS BUILDING BAN

Three days after he scuttled a building ban supported by the Disney company, 
Mayor Fred Hunter called an emergency council meeting Friday, reversed his vote 
and pushed through a one-year moratorium on development near the amusement 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who is up for reelection in November, said he had rethought his 
position after talking with city planners and officials of the giant 
entertainment conglomerate, which has proposed a second theme park near 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Tuesday, I've had an additional opportunity to not only review the 
ordinance, but meet with our planning staff and the executives of the Disney 
company," Hunter said. "The goal is to upgrade the commercial-recreation area. 
This will benefit not only the property owners in the area, but the citizens of 
Anaheim in general." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter immediately left the morning meeting for a previously scheduled knee 
operation and was unavailable for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Three City Council members followed Hunter's lead on Friday, passing the 
stricter moratorium they had preferred, but could not get approved Tuesday 
because urgency ordinances require four votes. Instead, the group had opted 
Tuesday for a weaker 90-day moratorium as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Irv Pickler, Tom Daly and Miriam Kaywood joined Hunter to pass 
the one-year moratorium 4-0 on Friday. Councilman William D. Ehrle, who had 
opposed the longer ban on Tuesday, was absent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they were pleased with the turnaround, but upset that 
Hunter had jeopardized relations with Disney officials for what they called a 
vote-getting move before the Nov. 6 council election. 
</P>
<P>
Pickler, who is vying with Hunter for the mayor's seat, called Hunter's change 
of vote "pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
Kaywood, who also is up for reelection, also took aim at the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the mayor of this city needs to understand the extremity of the issues 
and not flip-flop," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the foes of the moratorium were local developers and the Rev. Ralph 
Wilkerson, president of the large Melodyland church in the moratorium area. 
Developers have regularly contributed campaign funds to Hunter. And the 
church's congregation includes scores of Anaheim voters. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the debate, Disney officials have also contributed to the 
mayor's election coffers in the past. Last July, Hunter spent two days on a 
Disney-sponsored fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
Pickler, who along with Kaywood has also received donations from the Disney 
company and developers, said many people who attend Melodyland are not Anaheim 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was initially enacted in May for 45 days, then extended in June 
for 90 days. It expires today, and under state government code could only be 
extended once more, for a maximum of one year. 
</P>
<P>
City planners welcomed the reversal because they had said they needed more time 
to study how best to upgrade the tattered tourist area around Disneyland before 
a second development boom begins. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real pleased," City Manager Jim Ruth said. "We think it's a giant step 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Despite competition from Long Beach, which also wants to host a second Disney 
theme park, Ruth said Disney officials had assured him that a park in Anaheim 
would be feasible. "They haven't made any final determinations or anything," 
Ruth said. "What they've said is, it's a lot more plausible than they'd 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth said the full one-year moratorium is needed to allow time to complete a 
draft environmental review of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams and even gridlock already plague the area, and city officials have 
said they want to improve traffic flow before adding more development. Among 
the projects under study are widening the Santa Ana Freeway, expanding Katella 
Avenue and improving West Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic really is unbearable. Something has to be done to address 
infrastructure improvements," said Kerry Scott Hunnewell, director of 
development for the Disney Development Co. "Disneyland has been there 35 years. 
We're obviously an integral part and have a continuous business interest in 
that area." 
</P>
<P>
Hunnewell said that the company has supported the moratorium and that planning 
will be beneficial to the area even if Disney does not build another theme park 
on land it owns just west of Disneyland.

MISDEMEANOR CHARGES AHEAD IN MOOSE RAID; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY REJECTS FELONY COUNTS IN THE SEIZURE OF 
SLOT AND POKER MACHINES AT A HUNTINGTON BEACH LODGE.

<P>
At least four people will be charged with misdemeanor gambling offenses 
stemming from a two-year investigation of a Moose lodge in Huntington Beach, 
prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers at the Loyal Order of the Moose Lodge No. 1832 will be among those 
charged, Deputy Dist. Atty. Nina Rose Brice said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach police seized slot machines, poker machines, bookmaking 
documents and lottery records in a Sept. 7 raid. Officers said they also found 
$7,000 in cash and gambling receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Brice said Friday that police had gathered evidence against eight people and 
that felony charges had been discussed. But Brice said that after reviewing the 
evidence, she decided to file misdemeanor charges against four or possibly five 
people. 
</P>
<P>
She declined to name them until charges are filed, which will probably not be 
until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were so minimally involved that it doesn't seem appropriate to me 
for a filing," Brice said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, she said, some of those charged were "not only active 
participants but in a position to permit others to engage in this type of 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
Brice said she ruled out felony charges because "they were not out taking the 
public's money, and they were not being deceptive about the purposes -- there 
was never any suggestion that the money raised would be given to charity." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Brice said, "a lot of money passed hands over these games," which 
she said also included Super Bowl pools. 
</P>
<P>
"This is many, many, many thousands of dollars and many, many games, and they 
seemed to be going on all the time," Brice said. "It's like walking into a 
little casino." 
</P>
<P>
Moose officials have said the organization raises money for such charities as 
the Blind Children's Learning Institute and sponsors the Special Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said the investigation was prompted by citizen complaints against 
the lodge on Lorge Circle.

ANGELS ABLE TO OFFSET THE GRIFFEYS

<P>
When he was still known as Ken Griffey and the "Sr." wasn't appended to his 
name, he dreamed of playing in an outfield with his son. 
</P>
<P>
To imagine that he would hit the first in a historic sequence of back-to-back 
home runs by father and son was something else. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd think of it, but you're never sure it's going to happen," said 40-year-old 
Ken Sr., who joined the Mariners on Aug. 29 after being released by the Reds. 
"We had been talking about it last summer, but he was in the Northwest and I 
was in Cincinnati. I just didn't think it was going to happen. . . . We weren't 
trying for it. I was just trying to hit the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Jr. followed his father's example. After the elder Griffey lined an 0-and-2 
pitch from Kirk McCaskill 402 feet to center field in the first inning Friday 
night, 20-year-old Ken Jr. followed with a 388-foot blast into seats in 
left-center to bring the 34,180 fans to their feet. "It was fun," said Ken Jr., 
who was outdone by his father on distance but not in the brilliance of his 
post-home-run smile. "I just wish we'd have won the game." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield, who used to watch Ken Jr. frolic around Yankee Stadium when he 
and Ken Sr. played in New York, prevented the Griffeys from fully enjoying the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield hit two home runs and had five runs batted in, becoming only the 26th 
player in history to reach 1,500 RBIs, as he led the Angels to a 7-5 victory at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to ruin it," Ken Sr. said in mock sorrow. "He really hit them, though." 
</P>
<P>
The night was full of memories for Winfield, who took over the club lead with 
65 runs batted in as the Angels gained their fifth consecutive victory. 
However, because the Oakland Athletics defeated Minnesota, 9-1, the Angels were 
mathematically eliminated from the American League West race. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't spoil the occasion for Winfield, who was 0 for 19 against the 
Mariners this season until his third-inning homer off Matt Young (8-15). 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight was like keeping up with the Joneses, only it was keeping up with the 
Griffeys," Winfield said. "It was great. It was a great game. . . . It was 
special, this game," 
</P>
<P>
Ken Jr. returned the compliment. "Winny hasn't changed a bit," he said. "I just 
got taller." 
</P>
<P>
The historic moment came after Harold Reynolds led off the game with a walk. 
Ken Sr. smashed McCaskill's changeup slightly to the left of straightaway 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Jr. worked the count to 3-and-0 and was given the hit sign, at least partly 
because of the potential historic moment. "I've given him the green light often 
on 3-and-0, but I really thought they were going to try and walk him," Mariner 
Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "I almost didn't see it because I had my head 
turned. . . . What a moment. You'd like to win this game after seening Senior 
and Junior going back-to-back. You're never going to see this happen again. I 
mean, with another father and son. I hope we see it again." 
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 lead vanished in the third on a run-scoring single by Dick Schofield 
and Johnny Ray before Winfield unloaded against Young for a 5-3 lead. The 
Mariners pulled even in the seventh on a pair of unearned runs following center 
fielder Devon White's misplay of Reynolds' single, but the Angels took the lead 
for good after a double by Ray, a groundout, and Winfield's 18th homer of the 
season, off a fastball over the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The homer made a winner of Bob McClure (2-0). Bryan Harvey earned his 23rd save 
and tied Dave LaRoche for the Angel career lead with 65 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said Friday no decision has been made on whether 
Manager Doug Rader would return next season, but the delay seems to favor 
Rader's chances of getting a contract extension. It's unlikely Port would make 
Rader wait if Rader was not going to be rehired. . . . Bryan Harvey's 23rd save 
gave him 65 with the Angels, tying a club record held by Dave LaRoche. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Rose, recalled from triple-A Edmonton on Thursday, became the sixth man 
to play third base for the Angels this season. 
</P>
<P>
He follows Rick Schu, Jack Howell, Kent Anderson, Donnie Hill and Pete 
Coachman. The Angels have also used six players at first, six at short and 
seven at second: Johnny Ray, Mark McLemore,541290337

TITAN COACH BEING PROBED ABOUT CALLS; 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON: SOURCE TELLS UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS THAT PLAYERS HAVE USED COACH'S 
OFFICE PHONE IN VIOLATION OF NCAA RULES.

<P>
The Cal State Fullerton athletic department is investigating allegations that 
women's volleyball team members were allowed to use coach Jim Huffman's office 
telephone to make long-distance calls, a violation of NCAA rules, school 
officials have confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking into the phone questions," Athletic Director Ed Carroll said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said a complaint from "a single source" prompted the inquiry. Carroll 
and Fullerton Associate Athletic Director Leanne Grotke declined to say who 
made the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman told a reporter that within the past two weeks "Leanne (Grotke) asked 
me if I'd let anybody make long-distance phone calls and I said, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
Huffman, who was named head coach in 1989, said the rules prohibiting 
student-athletes from using their coaching staff's office telephones are "kind 
of nebulous." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do anything . . . for an athlete that you wouldn't do for anybody 
else," Huffman said. "I can't lend an athlete my car because I wouldn't lend 
just anybody my car. On top of that, you can't give an advantage" to a 
student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"If I let kids come in and make long-distance calls that would be an 
advantage," Huffman said. He added that such an advantage would be an improper 
enticement in recruiting athletes from out-of-state. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant volleyball coach Marlon Sano, who shares Huffman's small office, told 
a reporter that, "Sometimes there will be calls made to home" if, for example, 
a student has left something at home. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) we never gave any permission to make long-distance calls," Sano said. 
"We just flat out didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman replaced Fran Cummings, who resigned under pressure. In his first 
season, Huffman's team broke a 34-match Big West Conference losing streak by 
upsetting then-18th-ranked San Diego State. But the Titans finished with an 
8-23 record, 1-17 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the rationale for hiring Huffman was his ability to raise funds for the 
volleyball program. Huffman said that last year's fund-raisers accounted for 
about $15,000. His goal is $30,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The funds, which have been raised largely by putting on grass-court tournaments 
open to the public, have increased the volleyball program's scholarships from 
six the year before he was hired to 11, Huffman said.

NEW BUCCANEER COMES WAY BACK; 
</P>
<P>
TAMPA BAY: AFTER 20 MONTHS OFF, RUNNING BACK GARY ANDERSON PROVES HE'S NONE THE 
WORSE FOR LACK OF WEAR.

<P>
Even the most casual NFL observer has figured it out by now. No matter how many 
coaches stress the importance of attending training camp -- you know, timing, 
rhythm, conditioning, practice makes perfect and all that -- it simply isn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the Philadelphia Eagles. Holdout Lawrence Taylor returns to the New 
York Giants' practice field for a couple of days and then wreaks havoc in the 
Eagle backfield. 
</P>
<P>
The list of the training camp myth-busters grows each year. More and more 
big-name holdouts return to action apparently none the worse for the lack of 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
If this trend has your favorite NFL coach grumbling about the deterioration of 
discipline in this grand old game, don't tell him about Gary Anderson. The 
Tampa Bay running back is proof that while 40 days off probably won't hurt a 
guy, 20 months away can be downright rejuvenating. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who sat out the entire 1989 season because of a contract dispute with 
the San Diego Chargers, arrived in Tampa Bay via a trade this spring. And, last 
Sunday, he arrived in the Detroit Lion secondary with alarming frequency during 
his first game in almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
He carried 21 times for 74 yards and caught six passes for 79 yards and the 
go-ahead touchdown in the Buccaneers' 38-21 victory. On nine of the 15 times 
Tampa Bay faced a third down, Anderson got the call. Six times, he picked up 
the first down. 
</P>
<P>
"I really felt pretty good," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
So how'd he do it? Did he hire some out-of-work linemen to come over to his 
back yard so he could practice reading blocks? Did he employ the services of a 
personal trainer and a nutritionist to stay in shape? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd get up and work out between 5 and 6 in the morning, then I'd get home in 
time to take my kids to school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so he ran and lifted weights, but this was hardly a Rocky training regimen. 
These days, many people push themselves through a similar routine a couple of 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Anderson's smashing re-entry into the NFL's Sunday night highlight show 
circuit had little to do with morning jogs and weight rooms. He returned with 
the same explosive speed, instinct and exceptional pass-catching ability that 
helped him become a constant threat to break a big play with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson averaged five yards per carry and gained 1,119 yards with San Diego in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's success, according to Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, is 
more than a tribute to athleticism, however. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great athlete, but he has the ability to turn that into great 
productivity on the field and that's a rare combination," Shurmur said. "If you 
want to talk about somebody who runs, catches and blocks and does it all at a 
very high level, he's got to be in the Top 10 in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay gave up a third-round draft choice and one conditional (it could be 
as high as a second based on Anderson's performance this season) and picked up 
Anderson. The acquisition was enough to prompt some prognosticators to tab the 
perennially punchless Bucs as the favorite in the NFC Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, even Coach Ray Perkins' down-home drawl lifts an octave or two when he 
talks about Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great player, he really is," Perkins said. "He (never) ceases to amaze 
me every day in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives us the speed and cutting ability that we didn't have before in a 
running back. Plus, he also adds the dimension of a receiver coming out of the 
backfield or we can split him out wide. He just gives us much more flexibility 
on offense." 
</P>
<P>
That was clearly the case Sunday when Tampa Bay's offensive linemen and 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde spent much of their postgame interviews praising 
the Bucs' new back. Testaverde, who was not sacked by the Lions, liked the idea 
of forcing the defense to concentrate on something other than his destruction. 
</P>
<P>
And Perkins couldn't help but gloat, explaining to the media that "special 
players are supposed to play special." 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people would say he hasn't played in a year, so he's going to 
be rusty," Perkins said, unable to hold back a laugh. "I don't think that's 
true, especially about running backs. Gary is young, he's never had a serious 
injury and he takes good care of himself physically. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think the year off would make that much difference. That's why 
we didn't even play him much in the preseason." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson always believed he would play again. It was just a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute with the Chargers escalated into a war of words in the press with 
then-San Diego General Manager Steve Ortmayer. Anderson vowed he would never 
again play for San Diego and was determined to sit out until he was traded. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the biggest thing was that Mr. Ortmayer waited until just about two or 
three days before training camp and then he gave me an offer and told me to 
take it or leave it," Anderson said. "Then he sent me another that was lower 
than the first. I didn't understand how he thought he was trying to sign me to 
a contract or negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the talk in the paper and everything else, that was the turning 
point. I don't have hard feelings for San Diego. I wish them well. It was just 
that me and Mr. Ortmayer didn't get along." 
</P>
<P>
When it finally ended, it ended pretty well for Anderson. He's making $875,000 
a year and working out of his home. His professional career began in Tampa Bay 
-- a three-year stint with the USFL Bandits (1983-85) -- and he has lived there 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky we could work out the trade," Anderson said. "All the games were 
on TV (last season) and I caught quite a few of them. I knew they had a good 
team so I really felt pretty good about it. 
</P>
<P>
"They really played well and lost a lot of games in the fourth quarter. The 
offense really came around. I thought I could step in the backfield and help 
them out and all that stuff came true." 
</P>
<P>
It's a reality Shurmur and the Ram defensive unit must face. Stopping 
Testaverde no longer necessarily means a victory over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Anderson's a force," Shurmur said, "and they're doing a good job of using his 
talents. In the same formation, he could be a blocker, or a runner or a pass 
receiver, and that makes it tough." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of talk was exactly what Perkins, who has coveted Anderson for years, 
had in mind when he finally won the services of the 29-year-old running back. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can give him the ball 20 to 25 times a game, I think that will suffice," 
Perkins said. "Whether we're handing it to him or throwing it to him, I think 
that's a good load for him." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is willing to play it any way the coach calls it. He's back in his 
element, on a football field where his talents make him special indeed, and it 
feels great. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm back into the flow and so I really feel right at home," he said. "Whatever 
(role), it doesn't really matter to me. If the situation comes up like it did 
Sunday, I'd be glad to do the same things. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not going to be like that every week. We've got so many different 
weapons, it could be anybody on any Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson already has made an impact on this team. After all, when is the last 
time you heard somebody say that about Tampa Bay?

TITANS FIGURE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Another week, another Southeastern Conference voyage, another dollar for the 
Cal State Fullerton football team, which plays today at Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, one might have figured this was just another lucrative loss 
for CSUF (Cal State Under-Funded). The needy Titans will collect $150,000 to 
play the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before Fullerton's strong second-half showing in a 38-17 loss to 
Auburn last week, a performance that made the Titans believe they can come 
here, take the money and win, not run. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still definite underdogs," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "But if we 
play like we did in the second half against Auburn, we're capable of staying in 
the game. We could beat them, but it would take a great effort by us, and some 
great things would have to go our way." 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing what outscoring Auburn, 14-7, in the second half will do for your 
outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
There was virtually no talk of defeating the third-ranked Tigers last week. The 
Titans' objectives were to be as competitive as possible and not be embarrassed 
on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Mission partially accomplished. The Tigers blew the Titans away in a 31-3 first 
half, but Fullerton held its own in the second for a more-than-respectable 
final score. 
</P>
<P>
Many would have considered Mississippi State to be another heavy favorite 
today, but the Titans' play against Auburn has changed Fullerton's 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans figure if they can stick with Auburn, the SEC favorite, for a half, 
why shouldn't they stick for two halves with Mississippi State, a lower-echelon 
SEC team that lost to Tennessee, 40-7, last Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
"We have a different confidence level this week -- we feel we can win," 
Fullerton running back Reggie Yarbrough said. "They're coming off a big loss 
and are probably feeling low. We're at the point where if we put things 
together, we can beat a lot of teams." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said if last Saturday's second half was an indication of how hard the 
Titans can play, they'll do fine today. Problem is, Murphy doesn't know how his 
inexperienced team will respond. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans struggled to beat Division II Sonoma State, 38-24, in the season 
opener and actually looked better in the second half against Auburn than they 
did the entire game against Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know this football team at all," Murphy said. "We didn't play with a 
lot of emotion against Sonoma State, but we did against Auburn. The toughest 
thing to do is emotionally arouse your team to perform at its highest level of 
ability every week. So anything that would happen today would not surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
One thing working for the Titans is their offensive style, which is foreign to 
most SEC teams. 
</P>
<P>
SEC teams are used to power offenses -- most would rather line up and stuff the 
ball down your throat than pass. Games are usually won in the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the SEC's "smash-mouth" style, Fullerton's offense wags its tongue 
at defenses, pecking away with quick short-yardage passes and spreading the 
field by sending out four or five receivers. 
</P>
<P>
There are even times when Fullerton uses a no-back set -- disdainful to SEC 
fans but often effective for the Titans. Some Auburn players admitted it was 
difficult adjusting to Fullerton's offense, and Murphy hopes the Bulldogs have 
similar problems today. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't smash-mouth when your only running back is your quarterback," Murphy 
said. "If you're not used to seeing a spread offense all over the field, you're 
bound to make mistakes. It would be like us facing a wishbone team. It would 
take longer for us to prepare, because we don't see that in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton also doesn't see the kinds of athletes SEC teams face on a weekly 
basis. Mississippi State might not be the class of the SEC, but the Bulldogs 
are in a class above the Titans when it comes to speed, size and strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes (our finesse) negates a mismatch in athletic ability," Murphy said. 
"But for the most part, speed kills and athletic ability catches up to you." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
A connecting flight that was supposed to have taken the Titans from Nashville 
to Jackson, Miss., was diverted from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Mich., because of 
thunderstorms Friday, and that left the Titans stranded in the Nashville 
airport for about six hours. When the team finally boarded another plane, 
departure was delayed for another half hour because of thunderstorms. The team 
missed a scheduled practice Friday evening and didn't arrive at its Columbus, 
Miss., hotel until 11:45 p.m. (CDT). . . . Freshman kickoff returner Dwayne 
McAfee missed the bus from Fullerton to LAX Friday morning and did not make the 
trip to Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said any thoughts his players entertained 
of this being an easy victory dissipated when they watched films of the 
Auburn-Fullerton game. "It certainly made our players realize that Fullerton is 
a good team, even though we don't know much about them," Felker said. "They 
battled Auburn, played very aggressively, and they gave them problems 
offensively and defensively. . . . Fullerton has its share of problems, too. 
Considered one of its strengths in the preseason, the Titans' defensive 
secondary is hurting. Free safety Terry Tramble, an All-Big West Conference 
pick in 1989, is out for the season with a broken forearm and cornerback Nuygen 
Pendleton has been slowed by a sprained ankle. Auburn took full advantage of 
the soft spots, passing for 339 yards and four touchdowns last week. . . . 
Offensive lineman John Cotti and Tim Drevno are also questionable for today's 
game with injuries. . . . One of Mississippi State's best defensive players is 
nose guard Demetrius Hill, a cousin of former Fullerton defensive lineman Jerry 
Leggett, who was recently cut by the Los Angeles Rams. Leggett, a Titan in 
1988, played three seasons at Mississippi State before transferring to 
Fullerton. . . . The Bulldogs have a dangerous return man in Tony James, who 
had 82 yards on two kickoff returns last week and a 71-yard punt return for a 
touchdown.

Esperanza High School's strong running game offset a weak passing night by 
senior quarterback Keith McDonald and paced the Aztecs to a 30-3 victory over 
Diamond Bar Friday night at Valencia High School. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza (2-0) rushed for 218 yards and had four running backs score 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec defense added a safety late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald threw four interceptions -- his all-time worst -- and completed one of 
nine pass attempts in the second half. He completed 9 of 21 for 113 yards on 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Garrick Emry anchored the ground game for Esperanza with 92 yards on 17 
attempts and a touchdown. His performance was supported by Chris Weissman 
(three carries for 55 yards and a touchdown), Jarod Smith (five carries for 41 
yards and a touchdown) and Marcus Tayui (six carries for 24 yards and a score). 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar's (1-1) only score was a 37-yard field goal by Nate Wolford with 
4:55 remaining in the first half. The Brahmas managed 94 yards rushing and 46 
yards passing. DENNIS KAISER

PRADO'S LONG SCORING RUN EARNS EL MODENA A VICTORY

Quarterback Jose Prado found the opening when he needed it to lead El Modena 
High's football team to a 7-0 victory over Sunny Hills in nonleague game Friday 
at Buena Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 1,000 saw El Modena (1-1) take possession after a Sunny Hills' 
punt on the Sunny Hills 41. 
</P>
<P>
On first down, Prado found an opening and went 41 yards down the left sideline 
and scored with 2:45 remaining in the fourth quarter. Prado, who had attempted 
two field goals that fell short of the goalpost, kicked the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to play games like this one seven days a week I would probably be 102 
years old," El Modena Coach Bill Backstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids played above their heads and rose to the occasion. Our offense scored 
when it had to and our defense played as a unit to come up with the big plays," 
Backstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Romo recovered two Sunny Hills fumbles and had one interception for El 
Modena. Dan Biello sacked Sunny Hills' quarterback Hakeim McKenzie and 
recovered a fumbled punt. 
</P>
<P>
"They played good defense against us and we played good defense against them," 
said Sunny Hills (1-1) coach Tim Devaney, "but El Modena executed well and we 
didn't." BOB BORSUM

SERVITE SCORES WITH :03 LEFT TO TOP LOS ALAMITOS

<P>
When his team fell behind in the final 1 minute 5 seconds, Servite football 
coach Larry Toner never gave up hope. 
</P>
<P>
When his offense was penalized twice in the final 20 seconds, Toner never gave 
up hope. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be at Servite as long as I have and lose confidence," Toner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars upheld their coach's faith when running back Mike Wallock scored on 
a one-yard plunge with three seconds left for a 21-17 victory over Los Alamitos 
Friday night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (1-1) fell behind, 17-14, with 1:05 remaining when a punt by Adam 
Thomas was blocked by Los Alamitos' Josh Beeney and recovered in the end zone 
by teammate Sandy Sternshein. 
</P>
<P>
But the Friars battled back in the final minute. Michael Hill returned the 
ensuing kickoff 57 yards to the Los Alamitos 33-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Then Servite quarterback Scott Jones went to work. 
</P>
<P>
He fired a 15-yard completion to Hill for a first down at the Los Alamitos 18. 
Then two completions were wiped out by interference and holding penalties. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 seconds left, the Friars found themselves at the 38-yard line. Jones 
found tight end Eric Osterhues open on the left side for a 37-yard completion, 
setting up Wallock's last-second dive. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the play we called," Toner said. "The only thing that went wrong was 
that he (Osterhues) went out of bounds." 
</P>
<P>
Servite had taken a 14-10 lead with 6:16 left when Mike Wallock's three-yard 
dive capped a six-play, 58-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Although the offenses provided plenty of excitement in the final seconds, the 
first half belonged to the defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos quarterback John Collins, who had played well in a 7-3 win over 
Marina last week, completed only three of 11 passes for 14 yards in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins managed only 49 yards in the first half, 30 coming on a run by 
Andrew Fuentes on the last play before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
What little scoring the Griffins did, came from their defense. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Cashman intercepted a pass by Servite's Scott Jones at the Los Alamitos 
nine-yard line and returned it 91 yards for a touchdown to give the Griffins a 
7-0 lead with 8:40 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Servite answered on the ensuing possession, capping an eight-play, 56-yard 
drive with a seven-yard touchdown run by Jones with 4:11 left. Jones keyed the 
drive with a 25-yard completion to Osterhues. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos (1-1, and ranked 10th in the county) kept control of the ball most 
of the third quarter, using 18 plays to drive 59 yards to the Servite 12. When 
the drive stalled, kicker Eric Wallace came in to boot a 29-yard field goal 
that gave the Griffins a 10-7 lead with 5:29 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins' drive was highlighted by Collins' two completions for 22 yards 
and a fake punt by Cashman that netted five yards and a first down.

RETAILING: THE LIKES OF BERT AND ERNIE, BIG BIRD AND THE COOKIE MONSTER WILL 
TEST THEIR MERCHANDISING STRENGTH AGAINST DISNEY AND HANNA-BARBERA OUTLETS.

Big Bird and Ernie met baby strollers -- lots of them -- parked outside the 
nation's first Sesame Street retail store, which opened Thursday at South Coast 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Sesame Street General Store, which loosely resembles the set of the 
long-running Public Broadcasting Service television show, is the first of a 
dozen such outlets due to open in 1990. Three more stores will open this fall, 
in Glendale, Palo Alto and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Sesame Street store, operated by Sesame Street Retail Stores Inc. of 
Hayward, Calif., features merchandise based on Sesame Street characters: Bert 
and Ernie, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, Cookie Monster and Elmo. 
</P>
<P>
The store is part of a growing trend toward stores specializing in cartoon or 
TV characters. Walt Disney Co. has opened 67 Disney stores in the past three 
years and Hanna-Barbera Productions recently opened two stores. The Disney 
Store at South Coast Plaza opened in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Sesame Street concept will be a blockbuster," said Sarah Stack, 
analyst with the Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. "The 
Sesame Street characters are easily as well-known as the Disney characters." 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Plaza officials have gradually been building a children-oriented 
section near the mall's Carousel Court. The new Sesame Street store joins The 
Disney Store, F.A.O. Schwarz toy store, and the Bergstroms and GapKids 
childrens clothing stores near the carousel. 
</P>
<P>
The planning for Sesame Street stores has been in the works since 1988, said 
Eugene Platin, president and chief executive of the chain, who was at the 
Friday opening. The stores are targeting kids up to age 7 with clothing, toys, 
books, stuffed animals, arts, crafts and games, home furnishings, and bed and 
bath supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Stack said the Sesame Street store is apparently trying to distinguish itself 
from Disney by emphasizing an educational element. The Sesame Street store has 
a wall where kids can draw and has other play spaces, while The Disney Store is 
a more traditional outlet. 
</P>
<P>
She said both will capitalize on the enormous popularity of their names. "The 
name Disney or Sesame Street is a touchstone for all sorts of positive 
associations," she said.

Boycott Urged: Angered by a price increase announced last week, some users of 
the Prodigy electronic communication service asking other subscribers not to 
buy products promoted through advertisements on the service. A large-scale 
boycott could be a setback for Prodigy, a joint venture of Sears, Roebuck &amp; 
Co. and International Business Machines that has yet to turn a profit. The 
company's new pricing system raises monthly rates by $3-top $12.95-for those 
who pay on a monthly basis.

THRIFT'S CAMPAIGN TO RELY ON (FREE) FLIGHTS OF FANCY

American Savings Bank started its most ambitious sales campaign ever Friday by 
offering free and discounted flights on Continental Airlines to destinations in 
Europe, Asia, Mexico, Hawaii and 87 U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to drum up more deposits and loans, the thrift will begin advertising 
the program Sunday with a TV ad showing a silhouetted couple "Dancing the 
Continental." 
</P>
<P>
Banks and thrifts have long enticed customers with giveaways -- usually 
toasters and other small appliances. American's offer of plane trips is an 
unusually extensive promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most aggressive campaign we've ever sponsored," American 
spokeswoman Casey MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift, which has $16.5 billion in assets and earned $214.2 million last 
year, would not disclose how much the promotion is costing. 
</P>
<P>
Depositors who open certificates of deposit with $2,500, annuities, checking 
accounts and charge card accounts can get discounts on travel. A $20,000 
certificate of deposit earns a customer a free round-trip companion ticket to 
France, England, Japan, Hawaii or any of Continental's 87 U.S. destinations. 
</P>
<P>
An adjustable-rate mortgage for $50,000 or more brings two free round-trip 
tickets to anywhere Continental flies in Mexico, Hawaii or the United States.

PLAYWRIGHT REJECTS COUPLE'S BIGOTRY CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
In a phone interview Friday, playwright Christopher Durang rejected charges 
that his play "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You" constitutes 
"anti-religious bigotry," as has been charged by a Costa Mesa couple who are 
protesting a local production. 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree with calling the play bigoted, and I bristle at it," said Durang, 
who in writing the play drew from his own experiences as a student in Catholic 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're calling bigotry is really criticism," he said. "Does that mean 
that one can't criticize the church's stand on birth control?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sister Mary" was the subject of similar controversies in the early to 
mid-'80s. Durang said the uproar has died down in recent years but that he is 
not surprised it has resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
"The Feeneys (the Costa Mesa couple) are certainly in their right to protest 
and to try to change laws. I just hope they don't succeed. It's not appropriate 
to limit free speech that way," Durang said. 
</P>
<P>
John and Ernie Feeney have complained to the Costa Mesa City Council that a 
Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse production of "Sister Mary" violates newly adopted 
restrictions against "religious or political activity" by artistic groups 
receiving municipal grants. The city has given the nonprofit Playhouse $20,000 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Durang said he does not quite believe claims that the fight is over public 
funding, and not over censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"At heart," he said, the Feeneys "want to stop my play being spoken, and that 
is being a censor." RICK VANDERKNYFF

FIERY JAZZ PIANIST CAMILO TAKES NOTE OF HIS CRITICS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE DOMINICAN SAYS HIS FAST-PACED STYLE ISN'T AN AFFECTATION. HE PLAYS 
THE COACH HOUSE ON SUNDAY. 
</P>

"I guess you could call me a kind of hot-blooded person. I think quickly, I 
talk quickly, and when I play, I hear all these notes. It's not that I'm trying 
to show off, it's just the way I hear music." 
</P>
<P>
Michel Camilo, who plays Sunday night at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano, is in fact one of the fieriest pianists to come down the jazz pike 
since Oscar Peterson. His work snaps, crackles and pops with explosive 
technical energy. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm sometimes accused of having too much technique," Camilo 
acknowledged. "But if everybody played alike, music would be boring. What makes 
this life interesting -- and jazz in particular -- is personality. And that's 
what I try to bring to my playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the players I've been most influenced by, players like Phineas 
Newborn, Oscar Peterson, Bud Powell and Bill Evans. They all play a lot of 
notes too. But they also have their own kind of minimalism, and so do I, I 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
A good part of the Dominican Republic native's technical expertise traces to 
extensive classical training. A youthful prodigy in a family that already had 
two generations of composers and performers, he began writing his first 
compositions at age 5 and was playing major recitals before he was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess," he said with a laugh, "that I'd rather not throw away all those 
painful years of practice and learning to play the instrument properly." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Camilo seems to have made an effort to counteract some of the criticism 
with his new Columbia/Epic album, "On The Other Hand." 
</P>
<P>
"I chose (that title) for a reason," he said. "It's like I'm saying, 'Sure, I 
can play fast, but, on the other hand. . . .' I see it as a kind of subtle way 
of letting people know that there are different aspects to my playing. 
</P>
<P>
"They think of me as a fiery player, but the album shows that I can write for 
horns, that I love ensemble work, and that I sometimes love to play tender 
music. It's like I'm flipping over the coin to show the other possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Camilo, bassist Michael Bowie and drummer Cliff Almond will demonstrate some of 
those other possibilities at the Coach House with numbers from the new album as 
well as selections from his first two chart-topping releases, "Why Not" (the 
title song won a Grammy in 1983 for Manhattan Transfer) and "On Fire." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the pieces reflect a blending of his Caribbean heritage with his 
experiences living in New York City for more than a decade. Curiously, however, 
when Camilo arrived in the city, there were few Caribbean traces in his 
playing; he was a hard bop player, pure and simple. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I used to play in the Dominican Republic," he recalled. "I know 
that sounds strange, but when you live on an island, you tend to look outside 
for influences. And all the records I listened to were hard bop. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when I came to New York, there were so many different clubs, with so 
many musicians who came here to measure themselves. . . . If you're going to 
survive, you have to start thinking about what you can do that will be 
different, that will help you stand out from the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Camilo's solution was to dip into his own background. "I said to myself, 'Wait 
a minute, I'm not just a hard bop player. I've got all these influences, all 
this other life experience, that I can use in my music.' And that's how I began 
to write music that had a little Caribbean flavor." 
</P>
<P>
He further developed his music by applying a few methods from his classical 
training. "Classical pianists really know how to milk a melody, and I use that 
approach. I try to find a shape for a song or a solo, something that makes it 
more than a stream of notes and phrases -- something with a beginning, a middle 
and an ending. And that's another place where the facility I have on the 
instrument has helped me. 
</P>
<P>
"But the bottom line for me is this: Does it move you or doesn't it move you? 
Is it touching something inside or isn't it? It's not how many notes you play, 
it's whether you're saying something or not. Whether you're painting the right 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is a language, the language of the soul. Especially jazz music. It's so 
here, now, right at this very moment. And that's what I've always loved about 
jazz. That's why I play it -- the challenge and the excitement and the 
spontaneity of instant composition. It's living music, on the edge. That's the 
risk of it. And I love living risky." 
</P>
<P>
 Michel Camilo and Ric Flauding play Sunday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15. Information: (714) 
496-8930.

6 WORKS TO HIGHLIGHT S.D. GLOBE SEASON 
</P>

<P>
The West Coast premiere of a new play by A.R. Gurney and a California premiere 
by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner August Wilson will highlight San Diego's Old 
Globe Theatre's 1991 winter season of six new works, theater officials 
announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation of Wilson's "Two Trains Running" will mark the playwright's 
third West Coast premiere in four years at the Old Globe. Gurney's "The Snow 
Ball" will be his third world premiere here in three years. 
</P>
<P>
The other world premieres will be Lillian Garrett's "The White Rose" and Larry 
Ketron's "Sun Bearing Down," which have already been presented in staged 
readings here earlier this year as part of the Old Globe's Play Discovery 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
The Globe is co-producing Wilson's "Two Trains Running" with the Yale Repertory 
Theatre, where the play debuted earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Like Wilson's two earlier Pulitzer Prize-winning plays, "Fences" and "The Piano 
Lesson," "Two Trains Running" looks at another decade of African-American life 
in the 20th Century; it takes place in a Pittsburgh diner in 1968 after the 
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Tony-award winning director Lloyd Richards, who directed all of Wilson's 
previous works in this series, will direct the play, which will run from March 
14 to April 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe will co-produce "The Snow Ball" with the Hartford Stage Company 
in Hartford, Conn. "The Snow Ball," running here May 9 though June 16, is a 
15-character play adapted from Gurney's novel of the same name. It focuses on 
the author's familiar world of genteel but disenfranchised American WASPs. 
</P>
<P>
The season at the Globe's two indoor theaters will begin with two world 
premieres, "The White Rose" on the Old Globe main stage Jan. 17 to Feb. 24, and 
"Sun Bearing Down" at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage Jan. 12 to Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"The White Rose," directed by Old Globe executive director Craig Noel, will run 
Jan. 17 through Feb. 24. It is based on the true story of a band of German 
students who were martyred fighting against Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
"Sun Bearing Down," a story about life in a seafood restaurant along the South 
Carolina coast, will be followed by the San Diego premiere of "Other People's 
Money," Jerry Sterner's Off-Broadway comedy hit about a sleazy corporate raider 
who tries to take over a New England town, running March 9 to April 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Cassius Carter season will conclude with "La Fiaca," May 9 though June 16, 
a black comedy from the Old Globe's Teatro Meta project.

FORMICA NOT JUST FOR THE KRAMDENS ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Formica, traditionally, has had about the same effect on Americans as jail. 
We'll concede that it's probably necessary in the public sector, but we 
wouldn't want it anywhere near our house. 
</P>
<P>
When it first appeared in the 1950s, Formica was the interior lineman of 
building materials: functional, durable and nobody's idea of subtle beauty, 
able to withstand heroic amounts of grime and still come clean. It was the 
roadside diner's shield against the world, covering countertops from coast to 
coast with low-maintenance -- but nonetheless ghastly -- colors, reeking of 
fried onions and Pine-Sol. 
</P>
<P>
In the home, however, Formica was strictly for the Kramdens. It was the table 
top of choice for people with children who threw food. You could hose it down, 
but you didn't want to put the Waterford on it. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, you can use that veteran laminate material in your kitchen and 
bathroom without risking turning them into a knockoff of every beanery in the 
world named EAT. Formica has gone uptown. 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry; it's still Formica. It's still resistant to most of the slings and 
arrows of outrageous fortune, like strained beets and certain low-impact 
kitchen explosions. But instead of looking like the centerpiece of a cartoon 
nightmare, with swirls here and whirls there, all on a background of thundering 
yellow, today's Formica can be had in such incarnations as Nile Dorian Marble, 
Bronze Lacque Metallique and Vicuna Milano Stripe. 
</P>
<P>
"The patterns and the colors have been so expanded that now you have a rainbow 
of things to work with," said Mary Knott, a residential space planner and owner 
of Mary Fisher Designs in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Knott, who will speak about the uses of Formica at the Orange County Interior 
Design and Home Decorating Show at the Orange County Fairgrounds on Sept. 22 
and 23, said the popularity of the original Formica was diluted not only by the 
limited designs available at the time, but by cheap imitations. 
</P>
<P>
"The patterns they came out with at the time, like the boomerang pattern, for 
instance, were very Art Deco, with blues and pinks and yellows, and the 
appliances then followed suit in that color range," Knott said. "They were 
quite limited and they didn't have the subtle color changes they do now. And, 
as with many other things, mass merchandisers get knockoffs that are made from 
cheap materials and use them in a way that those materials were never meant to 
be used." 
</P>
<P>
What can you use Formica for now? Just about anything except a floor covering, 
Knott said. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people think of laminate materials strictly as countertops," she said. 
"But one of the best surfaces to use it on is cabinetry. That and wall 
surfacing is where I think you're going to see more and more builders and 
contractors using it." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the plain vanilla days, this doesn't mean simply slapping a sheet of 
Formica on a surface, said Knott. The Formica Corp. has come up with a laminate 
material they call Colorcore that is "solid color all the way through. You can 
literally layer these materials and make all kinds of incredible designs. The 
only limitations are your imagination and your pocketbook." 
</P>
<P>
The traditional Formica laminate -- which is still available -- is bonded to a 
dark-colored backing that is revealed when the material is cut at, say, the 
edge of a counter. Colorcore is the same thickness, but the backing is 
eliminated. The color is solid throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bevel it, you can round it off, you can do any kind of edge treatment 
you want," Knott said. "You can take layers of it and make striping and banding 
and wild stuff like pin stripes and make very creative looks." 
</P>
<P>
How creative? Any shape you can cut is fair game. Knott said she had heard of 
one application on a wall that involved layering the laminate and cutting one 
layer to resemble ripped construction paper. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she said, it's possible to pile on multiple layers and then cut geometric 
designs through the layers with a router, allowing all the colors to show 
through at the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
But kids, don't try this yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is to have a good fabricator who has worked with the material and is 
familiar with the proper tools," Knott said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a fabricator who's willing to take time and work with you and 
who knows all the wild stuff you can do with laminates. It really has to be 
handled with particular tools, so the best thing to do is to go through the 
trade." 
</P>
<P>
This generally means going to a cabinet shop, rather than a lumberyard or home 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The more generalized stores may carry some laminates, but the variety probably 
will be limited, Knott said. 
</P>
<P>
Formica isn't inexpensive. Price depends on the type and style of the material. 
But, said Knott, "it's not as (expensive) as some of the natural materials 
around. It's about neck-and-neck with wood." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Formica is doggedly contemporary, though, which ought to be good news 
for nostalgia buffs and people bent on re-creating Pop's Malt Shoppe in their 
den. In the back of the Formica color catalogue are four pages of examples with 
names like Neo Papercraft and Sorbet and Moonstone Papyrus. 
</P>
<P>
But there, at the top of the last page, is an example called Rosetta Boomerang. 
</P>
<P>
It's a deep pink shot through with intersecting yellow, blue and lavender 
parabolas. The kind of design you would have seen in Tomorrowland 35 years ago, 
a style that was known as futuristic when jet propulsion was new, the stuff 
that surely must have covered Buck Rogers' bathroom countertops. 
</P>
<P>
Formica kept it, bless them. The classics never die.

HOW TO FIX PLASTER CEILING THAT DROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Q. Our old house has a plaster ceiling that's beginning to sag in a couple of 
spots in the living room and master bedroom. What's causing it and how can I 
fix it? 
</P>
<P>
S.T., 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A. "Usually this is caused when you have a leak or some water damage from 
above," says plasterer Charles Jackson of Newport Beach. "That's probably 
causing either the plaster to pull away from the wooden lath, or the wooden 
lath to pull away from the ceiling joist. 
</P>
<P>
"The plaster will have to be chipped away and the lath will have to be nailed 
back into place and then the whole area needs to be replastered. This type of 
patch is pretty difficult, even for a professional. You'll need a lot of 
patience or you'll have to call someone in to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Q. Every time I turn on the hose in the back yard, there's an incredible 
pounding and rattling inside the house. I suspect the problem's in that 
back-yard spigot, but could that be causing all the noise inside the house? 
</P>
<P>
J.A., 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 
</P>
<P>
A. "It sounds like it's the stem on the hose bib," says Murrita Faller of 
Jordan Hardware in Santa Ana. "If there's a loose washer or if the threads on 
the hose bib are loose, it's going to make a pounding noise when the water's on 
that you'll probably hear inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, you see this problem inside the house, like in the kitchen sink when 
the bottom washer loosens and starts going up and down, making a lot of noise. 
To replace the hose bib, you're looking at a fairly easy job unless it's 
soldered on, which takes a little more skill. You'll need to melt it off and 
then resolder it on. Most of the time, bibs are just threaded onto 1/2- or 
3/4-inch pipe, and you can wrench it off." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I'd like to install a ceiling fan in our living room. However, there's no 
ceiling fixture there now and I don't know how you would hook up the electrical 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
T.C., 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
A. "In newer homes where there's no ceiling fixture, there might be a wall 
switch that turns something on, like an outlet for a lamp," says Ed Steenbergen 
of Martenet Hardware in Anaheim. "Usually, you try to tie into that switch. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't do that, you've got to run a whole new line from some other 
existing receptacle. To get to the line, you have to go through the attic and 
attach a connection for your fan to the wiring from that switch or another 
outlet. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're trying to do this in a condominium or in the first floor of a 
two-story house, you're dealing with a tougher project. Sometimes, you might 
have surface lights around the ceiling. The fan would hook into that and the 
wire runs across the ceiling. Or, there's usually a dead-air space of 6 to 8 
inches above your ceiling. You can cut a hole in there and try to work the wall 
receptacle wire up there with what's called fish tape, but that's not an easy 
job; it takes a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I'm considering putting a concrete sidewalk in our back yard myself, but I 
want to know about curing the concrete. I've seen professionals hosing down 
concrete driveways to make sure they don't dry too quickly, yet I've been told 
that with today's concrete, I just have to pour it and forget it. Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
S.A., 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
A. "After it's poured and finished, you're better off not putting any more 
moisture on there," says Ken Newland of Tustin Block. "If it's drying and 
getting wet, drying and getting wet, the concrete is constantly shrinking and 
expanding and you're apt to get hairline cracks. When you pour it, make sure 
that it's wet enough to finish and let it dry naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"Keeping it moist used to be fairly common. During construction of freeway 
bridges, you'd see workers put wet burlap bags on top of the concrete because 
the burlap retains moisture, and they'd stay wet as the water tried to 
evaporate from the drying concrete. The object was to keep it constantly wet 
until it was cured. However, to ask the average homeowner to go out and 
constantly hose down the sidewalk, that's too much to ask, especially in this 
weather."

A woolly bear caterpillar as weather forecaster? 
</P>
<P>
According to Country America magazine, people have for many years looked to 
various signs from nature, the bands on the bodies of woolly bear caterpillars 
among them, as sources for meteorological predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Some are simple indications of fact, but some have tales behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
What does an early bloom on a wildflower such as a black-eyed Susan tell about 
the weather? Fall will be coming early. 
</P>
<P>
Sun dogs -- those orange spots that appear before sunset -- are an indication 
that there will be rain within the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
What can you tell from the rings on the woolly bear caterpillar's body? The 
severity of the coming winter. If, for example, the caterpillar has black bands 
on either end and a brown band in the middle, expect the winter to begin and 
end with cold temperatures and to have milder temperatures during the middle. 
</P>
<P>
And when butterflies flit high above the rooftops in late fall? Winter will 
arrive soon. 
</P>
<P>
Spider webs on the ground are another indication that a cold, hard winter is 
coming.

Capizzi -- Remarks of Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi were characterized 
incorrectly in a story Friday about the Amber Jefferson case.

The story mistakenly said Capizzi had criticized black community leaders. In

DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT MAY BE TURNING A CORNER; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: AFTER MUCH RED INK AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL, THE MCDONNELL UNIT IS 
MAKING PROGRESS IN ITS MD-11, MD-80 AND C-17 JET PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outlook at Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach, which has suffered through a 
long darkness of financial loss and management turmoil, appears to have 
brightened somewhat in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonnell Douglas subsidiary is expected to achieve its critical goal of 
obtaining government certification of the new MD-11 jetliner by Oct. 31, 
deliver a record number of MD-80s in the current quarter and keep the Air Force 
C-17 cargo jet on its revised schedule for a first flight in March. 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas is doing fine," Douglas President Robert Hood said Friday. "All in 
all, we are on track to do the things we said we were going to do. We are 
trying to get our systems fixed. We are trying to get some experienced people 
in manufacturing positions so we can fill our $55-billion backlog." 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace company still faces massive long-term challenges. Many of its 
manufacturing systems are antiquated, although its aircraft are modern. Its 
costs are high, despite painful cuts. Morale is improving, but more layoffs are 
possible. Nonetheless, engineers, production workers and managers said in 
interviews that they sense that the company may be turning a corner, at least 
in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
"The company was a horror story before, and now we are rolling," a production 
supervisor said. "We are solving our problems, and it boosts our morale." 
</P>
<P>
Investors, responding to a series of developments at Douglas and at other units 
within McDonnell, have sharply bid up the price of the company's stock. 
McDonnell shares closed trading Friday at $51.875, up from $41.375 on Aug. 30 
and from a summer low of $34.50 on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence M. Harris, securities analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, 
observed that McDonnell shares have outperformed Boeing in the past month, even 
though Boeing is generally considered by many analysts to have a stronger 
business outlook. In the past week, Douglas shares have zipped past Boeing, 
which closed Friday at $46.125. 
</P>
<P>
At least part of the reason for McDonnell strength comes from accounting magic, 
in which the firm purchased annuities to cover future pension liabilities, a 
move that boosted the book value of the stock from $86 a share to $92 a share, 
Harris noted. Also, short-sellers, who have bet against the stock, are 
apparently fleeing their positions. 
</P>
<P>
But the investor interest also reflects an improved view of the company's 
business outlook. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait gave an immediate shot in the 
arm to the firm's C-17 transport, because it demonstrated the critical 
shortfall in U.S. military transport, a senior Pentagon official said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a decision to supply Saudi Arabia with McDonnell F-15 jet fighters 
out of the U.S. inventory could extend production of the aircraft, which was 
scheduled to end in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, Douglas appears headed for success in its MD-11 certification 
effort. The company is counting on obtaining Federal Aviation Administration 
certification by the end of next month, enabling it to deliver and book revenue 
for up to five of the $100-million jetliners this year. 
</P>
<P>
A key MD-11 official said in an interview Friday: "The flight testing is going 
really well, even though things are hectic. It is getting down to the time when 
you pray things go well, because time is limited now to fix things." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors within the aircraft industry have suggested all summer that the MD-11 
avionics system is deeply flawed, but Douglas officials insist that the 
avionics -- the cockpit electronics -- are performing well. The firm recently 
completed all testing on the first of four MD-11s, an important milestone. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the MD-11 is certified by Oct. 31, it will not be certified for 
Category III instrument landings, the most rigorous type. That part of the 
avionics system will be certified later, but officials say that will not affect 
deliveries or operation of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the MD-11 has had serious problems in its inability to achieve 
promised fuel efficiency. The company has acknowledged that the test aircraft 
burn 4% to 6% more fuel than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will meet our contractual commitments," Hood said about the 
problem. The company is trying to improve the fuel efficiency by changes to the 
engine, reducing drag and reducing weight. 
</P>
<P>
A representative for a major airline buying MD-11 said he remains "greatly 
concerned" about the fuel efficiency problem, but he senses an overall 
improvement at Douglas. "For a while, we did not feel anybody was in control," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The final month of MD-11 flight testing will include the function and 
reliability tests, which are particularly important to the FAA. Activity is so 
fast paced that a last-minute problem could derail the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Hood said the MD-80 program will be profitable for the foreseeable future. 
Douglas expects to deliver 80 aircraft in the second half of the year, up from 
59 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The massive $30-billion C-17 cargo jet program has also quickened its pace. The 
first aircraft is scheduled to be towed out of its giant hangar Sunday to a 
pressure pit, where workers will pressure-test the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has been through such a grind here, and now it looks like we are 
solving our problems," said one C-17 employee. "We really need it. We have been 
really down." 
</P>
<P>
But a knowledgeable government observer of the program still worries whether 
the problems on the C-17 are being fixed by brute force of assigning more 
people or by fixing the fundamental flaws that created the problems. Until the 
underlying causes of Douglas' troubles are fixed, profitability will continue 
to lag. 
</P>
<P>
A long series of management memorandums obtained by The Times indicated that 
Douglas itself believed that management had become lax, many workers lazy, 
conditions in the plant dirty and operations disorganized. Douglas lost $84 
million in this year's first quarter and $222 million last year. The firm's 
debt rating has been lowered twice. 
</P>
<P>
A radical management reorganization undertaken in 1989, in which 5,000 managers 
were forced out of their jobs and required to reapply for positions, has been 
revised and the most radical aspects abandoned.

Navy Exonerates IBM: The Navy said International Business Machines did not 
break federal contracting laws by providing advice and training for Navy 
personnel when it hoped to win lucrative mainframe contracts. Congress held 
hearings last November into allegations by smaller companies that IBM might be 
breaking laws in seeking military contracts. The Navy said a contracting 
official sought advice from IBM in drawing up specifications, but IBM did not 
initiate the offer.
