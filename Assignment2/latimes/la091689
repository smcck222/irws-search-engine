HARRY TUGEND; SCREENWRITER WAS ONE OF GUILD'S FOUNDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harry Tugend, whose credits cut a wide and varied swath through the early days 
of Hollywood and who was one of the founders of the Screen Writers Guild in 
1933, died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The screenwriter, producer and film executive began as a singer in vaudeville 
and wrote for such divergent stars as Fred Allen, Bing Crosby and Shirley 
Temple. He was 92 when he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Brooklyn, Tugend began creating sketches for Flo Ziegfeld's Follies, 
then joined the fabled Allen writing crew when the radio show went on the air 
in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
He went with Allen to Hollywood to make a film, "Thanks a Million," and soon 
began writing other feature productions, including "Captain January" and "The 
Littlest Rebel," for Temple in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
After he and about 100 of his fellow writers formed the Screen Writers Guild, 
Tugend, a spokeswoman said, signed the note for the guild's first building. 
</P>
<P>
Tugend's writing and producing credits include "King of Burlesque," "Little 
Miss Broadway," "Little Old New York," "Seven Sinners," "Birth of the Blues," 
"Golden Earrings," "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" and many more. His last was 
"Who's Minding the Store?" in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote the Broadway play "The Wayward Stork" and several television 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Tugend, a widower, is survived by his son, James, and two granddaughters.

KEY'S BID TO UNLOCK VOTES TO OUST MCCARTY IN DISTRICT 7 SEEMS DOOMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To mention unassuming, mild-mannered San Diego City Councilwoman Judy McCarty 
and "The Godfather" in the same breath seems thoroughly incongruous, yet 
McCarty's campaign consultant does just that to summarize her 7th District 
reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I think of Judy, I'm reminded of a line from 'The Godfather,' " said 
John Kern, who was McCarty's City Hall administrative assistant before leaving 
to start his own consulting firm. "The line is, 'Your friends should always 
underestimate your virtues, and your enemies should always overestimate your 
faults.' That's the way it is with Judy. 
</P>
<P>
"Because for someone who's been taken lightly, she's put together a pretty 
impressive record. And, for someone who was considered a pretty easy target 
this year, she drove nine people out of this race before it even began." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, early this year, McCarty's critics approached many community leaders 
throughout the 7th District, trying to find a strong challenger to block her 
bid for a second four-year term. Not only did each person approached decline to 
run, but some reported the entreaty to McCarty, who could only chuckle that her 
opponents "don't even know who my friends are." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11th-Hour Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Until shortly before the filing deadline, it appeared that McCarty might be the 
first council incumbent in nearly two decades to run unopposed. Although 
retired firefighter Kenneth Key entered the race at the eleventh hour, he is 
regarded as little more than token opposition for McCarty in the sprawling 
northern district, which includes the College area near San Diego State 
University, Allied Gardens, Grantville, Del Cerro, San Carlos, Tierrasanta and 
the Lake Murray area. 
</P>
<P>
With only two candidates on the ballot, the 7th District contest is the only 
one of the four council races that appears guaranteed to conclude in next 
Tuesday's primary. Under the new district-only election system, a candidate can 
avoid a November runoff by getting more than 50% of the primary vote. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing complacency and overconfidence as their major obstacles, McCarty's 
backers have waged an aggressive, well-funded campaign designed to produce the 
landslide victory widely expected of her. Though Key has raised less than 
$6,000, McCarty will end up spending about $120,000 -- a 20-1 disparity that 
Kern characterizes not so much as political overkill as necessity to meet the 
high expectations of an easy win. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battling Perceptions 
</P>
<P>
If the perception of the campaign as a race more in theory than in fact 
concerns McCarty, it is even more troublesome for Key, a 52-year-old Allied 
Gardens Democrat in his first race for public office. With most voters paying 
only cursory attention to an election predicted to draw less than a 20% 
turnout, Key's task of persuading them to share his view of McCarty as 
ineffectual, overly cozy with developers and preoccupied with her own community 
of San Carlos, to the detriment of the rest of the district, is all the more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. McCarty has done nothing to improve major problems such as drugs and 
traffic, and, on other issues, her actions have actually made things worse," 
Key said. "Like some others on the council, she's very beholden to developers, 
and her votes show that." 
</P>
<P>
To her supporters, however, McCarty, a former aide to then-Assemblyman, now 
state Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), is the archetypical 
citizen-politician. Professing disinterest in higher office, the low-keyed, 
soft-spoken McCarty describes herself as "just plain Judy from San Carlos." 
</P>
<P>
Having once described City Hall as being "like the PTA -- only the people are 
not as friendly," the 49-year-old McCarty approaches her job with a 
common-sense simplicity that has led critics to accuse her of lacking a deep 
understanding of complex issues. 
</P>
<P>
As highlights of her first term, the Republican councilwoman points to her role 
in securing funding for the completion of California 52 and three major 
connector roads or highways, the purchase of Rancho Mission Canyon and the 
addition of 680 acres to Mission Trails Regional Park, and pushing for creation 
of the Metropolitan Sewage Task Force, which is reviewing city plans to build a 
secondary-sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
Though she usually sides with the council's pro-growth majority, McCarty also 
co-authored, along with Councilman Bob Filner, a compromise growth-management 
plan. Rated as the council's third-worst member on growth issues by the Sierra 
Club, McCarty opposed the city's unsuccessful effort to halt the toxic-burning 
Ogden plant in La Jolla and supported the proposed SANDER trash-burning 
project, which has been withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
However, environmentalists also applaud her strong support of recycling 
programs, water reclamation and plans to eliminate products that contain 
ozone-damaging fluorocarbons. She also led the fight to preserve landscaping on 
California 163 through Balboa Park, causing state transportation officials to 
back away from a plan to remove trees because of concerns over the state's 
liability in accidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detractors' Perspective 
</P>
<P>
But, from her detractors' perspective, McCarty's own actions have undermined 
the very goals she espouses. Peter Navarro, chairman of Prevent Los 
Angelization Now, charged that McCarty has "gutted" growth-management measures 
and initially "walked blindly" into a plan that would have established "a 
dangerous precedent" by permitting a major Tierrasanta developer to shift costs 
for public facilities such as roads and sewer lines to home buyers. After a 
community uproar, McCarty and the council reversed positions and opposed the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Key has blamed McCarty for the eviction of a group of seniors from a city-owned 
campground at Hollins Lake in order to replace the habitat of an endangered 
bird displaced by the California 52 extension. McCarty, though, notes that the 
highway would not have been completed otherwise, adding that an improved 
campground will be built with state funds. 
</P>
<P>
Key's own platform includes proposals to revamp Navy ships to use as jails to 
help ease the county's longstanding jail crowding, and to alleviate parking 
woes near SDSU by having students park at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and 
take a shuttle to campus. As a corollary to the latter proposal, Key favors 
expediting the timetable for extending the trolley from Old Town to the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the funds to match the half-dozen mailers sent to voters by McCarty, 
Key has been forced to rely on simpler tactics, such as having supporters stand 
along roadsides with signs urging people to "Help Unlock City Hall . . . with 
Key." He also draws encouragement from his striking resemblance to country 
singer Kenny Rogers, describing his facial features as "one of my real 
attributes in this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Barring a major upset, however, the blues may be more indicative of what lies 
ahead for Key on Election Day.

Should Beverly Hills' most famous defendant be found guilty, Mayor Max Salter 
has a suggestion about what type of community service she could serve. 
</P>
<P>
"Zsa Zsa could rake leaves at our Robinson Gardens," said Salter, referring to 
the facility run by the County Arboretum. "She could work with the rose bushes, 
do a little digging in the garden. . . . I think it would be an interesting 
sight." 
</P>
<P>
If a telephone poll conducted by Accetta/Mosier Productions Inc. is at all 
accurate, perhaps Ms. Gabor should get her favorite pair of garden shears out. 
About 81% of the respondents supported the Beverly Hills police officer who 
cited her. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the city of Vernon won a measure of fame as the home of the 
mural-covered Farmer John slaughterhouse, poets were singing its praises. 
</P>
<P>
Today, on the 84th anniversary of the incorporation of Los Angeles' neighbor to 
the south, we reprint this poem, which appears in David Clark's "Los Angeles: 
City Apart." 
</P>
<P>
 The ode to Vernon was written by a real estate booster in 1887: 
</P>
<P>
Go wing thy flight from star to star, 
</P>
<P>
 From world to luminous world as far 
</P>
<P>
 As the universe spreads its flaming wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Take all the pleasure of all the spheres 
</P>
<P>
 And multiply each through endless years -- 
</P>
<P>
 One winter at Vernon is worth them all. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Vernon never became the Miami Beach of the west. 
</P>
<P>
With Southern California becoming more crowded, and liability concerns on the 
rise, an old custom of the automobile age appears in danger here: Teaching the 
15 1/2-year-old in your family how to drive on a secluded piece of pavement. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that more and more parking lots seem to be roped off after 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Park is even less subtle, citing an obscure city ordinance in its lot 
along with a sign warning, "No Practice Driving." 
</P>
<P>
(The ordinance applies to unlicensed motorists, not to golfers wishing to 
polish their swing before stepping onto the course next door.) 
</P>
<P>
Brad Altman even found a "No Driving Instruction" sign on spacious Lucerne 
Boulevard in the Hancock Park area, where novice parallel-parkers are a not 
uncommon sight. 
</P>
<P>
The passing of the ritual could well evoke bittersweet feelings for those who 
have attempted to learn from Dad -- and can still recall his calm, measured 
bits of advice that were mingled with screams of, "You're wrecking the car! 
You're wrecking the car!" 
</P>
<P>
Who says we live in a cold, impersonal world these days? One Long Beach real 
estate agent addresses his pieces of junk mail to: "My Favorite Resident."

AL MARTINEZ: HOORAY FOR . . . ER . . . BELLFLOWER?

Civic pride can be an ugly emotion, elevating the territorial imperative to 
plateaus of brutal conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Poke fun at a home town and you run the risk of a counterattack vastly 
exceeding the tone or intent of the original comment. 
</P>
<P>
Angry ladies hit the phone, editors of community newspapers hit their battered 
old word processors and almost everyone writes a letter. 
</P>
<P>
Not that I am unfamiliar with abuse. Just yesterday I received a note from a 
woman who attacked me for my views on mountain lions. She called me what Zsa 
Zsa Gabor is said to have called Officer Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
I was ready to defend myself when it occurred to me I hadn't even written 
anything on mountain lions. Defending an action I hadn't taken would be like 
Poland apologizing for World War II. 
</P>
<P>
When I telephoned the lady to tell her there had been no mention of mountain 
lions in my column, she chewed me out for having ignored an imminent peril to 
an entire species of animal. Then she hung up. 
</P>
<P>
Which leads, however circuitously, to Bellflower and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
I made fun of both cities recently and am busy ducking the outraged response. I 
said no one of importance ever goes to Bellflower, and there's nothing to do in 
Hollywood that doesn't require a condom. 
</P>
<P>
Katie, bar the door. 
</P>
<P>
I heard first from Bellflower, which is just south of Paramount and not to be 
confused with Bell Gardens, which is near Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Proud citizens telephoned, civic leaders wrote and a local poet tried to rhyme 
Bellflower with hell's hour in verse intended to glorify the town's ecumenical 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Of special note, however, was an editorial in the tabloid-sized Paramount News 
Tribune entitled, "Importance of Being Al." 
</P>
<P>
I knew I was in trouble with the first line: "How easy it is to make fun of 
something decent." 
</P>
<P>
The editorial refers to me as "Call-me-Al" and says I fancy myself a 
second-rate David Letterman. I'm not sure why the Call-me-Al, but that's all 
right. It's better than being called Elmer Teenez. 
</P>
<P>
"Bellflower," the editorial fumes, "is better off if the likes of Charles 
Manson, Sirhan Sirhan, gang chieftains, Tom Bradley, drug kingpins, organized 
crime figures, talk show hosts, shallow movie stars and other 'important' 
people stay the hell out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Well, I . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That's not what matters in Bellflower." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't mean to imply . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Church matters in Bellflower." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so I wasn't . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Families matter in Bellflower. Good schools matter. Friendly neighbors and 
responsive local government matters." 
</P>
<P>
The message comes across like the drums of Gotterdammerung. The editor loves 
Bellflower. It could be worse. Some editors have never known love at all. 
</P>
<P>
Fly now on the wings of incredulity to Hollywood where, I have learned, not 
everyone is involved in erotic industry. There are, for instance, cobblers in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
I heard this from Oscar and Nyla Arsianian who are both members of the board of 
directors of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
They spoke for an hour on the abundance of art and human decency in their home 
town, giving lie to whoever said, "Strip away the phony tinsel of Hollywood and 
you find the real tinsel underneath." 
</P>
<P>
The Arsianians, who are man and wife, run a public relations business out of a 
ship-shaped building in Crossroads of the World, a unique complex of offices 
built about the time Errol Flynn was entertaining teen-aged girls aboard his 
yacht Sirocco. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar and Nyla are the driving force behind a campaign that extols the virtues 
of Hollywood, from its movie industry to, well, its cobblers. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime, prostitution and filth didn't stop the 'I Love New York' campaign," 
Oscar said. "They chose to point out the city's positive aspects. That's what 
we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Urban squalor, he adds, exists in Hollywood, but so do upbeat industries and 
decent little people who whistle as they work, much like the Seven Dwarfs 
around Snow White. 
</P>
<P>
Another booster heard from was Ken Schessler, whose book "This is Hollywood," 
offers plenty of activities that do not require condoms. 
</P>
<P>
You can visit the place where John Belushi OD'd, where silent film star Lou 
Tellegen killed himself with sewing scissors or where Clara Bow made love to 
the entire USC football team. Maps provided. 
</P>
<P>
Well, OK. I was wrong. Bellflower is a swell little town, and Hollywood is 
perfect for hookers and cobblers. 
</P>
<P>
Now I'm off on vacation for a month, so tuck your causticities away until 
October. I won't say where I'm going, but I'll tell you this. It won't be 
Bellflower.

2 SIDES IN VOTING-RIGHTS CASE CAUTIONED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Friday cautioned attorneys for the Chicano Federation and the 
city of San Diego not to allow the two sides' differences over attorneys' fees 
to scuttle a tentative settlement in a minority voting rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In a hastily called hearing, U. S. District Judge John S. Rhoades told the 
lawyers that case law gives him the power to set fees using certain formulas if 
the two sides cannot agree, a statement that mirrors the Chicano Federation's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying, basically is, if you can't agree, if the council particularly 
won't agree to the fee question, that you let me do it," Rhoades said from the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides announced a tentative settlement of the 20-month-old lawsuit in 
Rhoades' courtroom Wednesday. The agreement calls for voters to decide a June, 
1990, ballot measure on whether to expand the council from its current eight 
seats to 10 and mandates a redrawing of district boundaries by Oct. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preliminary Census Data 
</P>
<P>
The reapportionment will use preliminary U. S. Census data that Chicano 
Federation lawyers contend will most accurately reflect the growth in the 
city's Latino population. The final decision on redistricting will belong to 
the council, however, and not the independent commission originally sought by 
the federation. 
</P>
<P>
The federation achieved one major goal of its lawsuit last November, when 
voters approved a ballot measure changing the city's electoral system so that 
council members are elected only by members of their districts. Previously, 
council candidates ran in primaries within their districts, followed by 
citywide runoffs between the two top vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will not be final until the council votes to approve it Monday. At 
least one council member has expressed reservations over a provision that calls 
for the city to pay $20,000 in fees to federation attorneys Patricia Meyer and 
Mike Aguirre. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the two sides huddled in a lengthy closed-door session after 
Friday's hearing. They said later that they were negotiating language of the 
settlement agreement.

OFF-ROAD PARK LEFT IN LAWMAKERS' DUST; 
</P>
<P>
OTAY MESA DEVELOPER SAYS HE'LL UP THE ANTE IN NEXT ROUND

<P>
A frantic last-minute attempt to secure legislative approval for a $7-million 
deal to build an off-road vehicle park on Otay Mesa failed Friday as lawmakers 
wrapped up their deliberations for the year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, developer Roque De La Fuente II said he considers his offer to 
lease the land "withdrawn" and that any further negotiations with the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation will have to include more money. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I don't see the off-roaders or the state doing anything until the 
first quarter of 1990," De la Fuente said. "The offer on the table is going to 
be withdrawn by me, and, if they are going to negotiate, it's going to be for 
more money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Nearby Site 
</P>
<P>
The deal being pushed by the off-roaders would entail the state leasing nearly 
1,000 acres, most of it from De la Fuente, for 20 years so that off-road 
enthusiasts could legally ride their motocross bikes and three-wheelers on 
specially marked trails north of the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Off-road enthusiasts in San Diego have long complained that the closest place 
to ride their vehicles is 2 1/2 to 3 hours away at the 38,000-acre expanse at 
Ocotillo Wells, next to Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Off-roaders have 
secured a promise from San Diego County and state officials to use proceeds 
from their special "green sticker" license fee to build a closer park. 
</P>
<P>
But the way state officials structured their deal with De la Fuente caused 
lawmakers to balk at the idea earlier this year during deliberations over the 
state budget. 
</P>
<P>
The state wanted to pay De la Fuente $5.3 million for his 920 acres up front 
and take over title for the land. But it would agree to sell it back to him in 
20 years -- when it would be worth an estimated $100 million -- for only a 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said they are willing to pay the rent up front and take title 
to satisfy De la Fuente's requirement that he not be personally liable for any 
lawsuits arising out of accidents on his property. 
</P>
<P>
That provision caused a chorus of murmurs among legislative staffers, who also 
privately questioned the amount of money being offered to De la Fuente. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
275% Increase in Price 
</P>
<P>
A state appraiser just two years ago suggested paying De la Fuente no more than 
$77 an acre to lease the property; the recent asking price was about $288 an 
acre, nearly a 275% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ham, lobbyist for the off-roaders and De la Fuente, said he and other 
proponents of the deal overcame those questions during a hastily called public 
hearing on the matter last month. Legislators were told that Otay Mesa land 
such as De la Fuente's is skyrocketing in value and that any further waiting 
could cost the state dearly. 
</P>
<P>
Ham said that, although legislators gave him the green light for the park, he 
was unable to find a suitable bill in which to insert the $7-million request. 
At one point, it looked as though it could be included in a last-minute, 
$48.2-million pork barrel arrangement between the governor and the Legislature, 
but it was set aside because other pet projects crowded it out. 
</P>
<P>
Ham said his subsequent effort to stick the proposal into yet another bill 
during the waning hours of the 1989 legislative session were unsuccessful, 
leaving off-roaders to wait to bring up the deal again in January.

HUGE DOWNTOWN PROJECT TRIMMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John G. Davies, president of San Diego's downtown redevelopment agency, said 
Friday that he is "encouraged" by revisions that Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp. 
made this week to its $950-million downtown development plan but that "much 
remains to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe announced what it calls "major concessions" in cutting back the 
proposed square footage and "undergrounding" most of the parking for its 
proposed huge development surrounding its train depot on Kettner Boulevard near 
Pacific Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The city signed an agreement with Santa Fe in 1983 permitting a 
4.2-million-square-foot hotel, office and retail complex on 17 acres around the 
depot. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Saltzer, a spokeswoman for Santa Fe, said its original proposal called 
for office buildings, hotels and restaurants covering more than 4 million 
square feet. The revised proposal reduces the plan to 3.8 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
She said the '83 proposal called for enough above-ground parking to accommodate 
4,866 cars, which would have increased the square footage to more than 6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
She said the new proposal calls for 3,800 of the 4,400 parking spaces to be 
"below grade," or underground. The revisions also accommodate a Centre City 
Development Corp. request in Santa Fe's offering to give up right of way for an 
extension of the San Diego Trolley. CCDC is in charge of downtown 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
One point of contention in the new proposal is the fate of a vacant baggage 
building now attached to the depot. Saltzer said Santa Fe executives feel the 
baggage building should be demolished; Davies said CCDC wants it preserved, 
because it is a candidate for the National Register of Historic Places, even 
though it hasn't been used in years. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, that would be an important loss," Davies said. "So, we're anxious 
to have them revise the plan still further. The baggage building is part of the 
symmetry of the building itself. Once it's gone, the building will look 
truncated." 
</P>
<P>
Davies said CCDC opposed Santa Fe's original proposal because the agency wanted 
more views of the waterfront preserved and more open spaces for "urban parks" 
included.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor said Friday that she will ask Gov. George Deukmejian for 
about $31 million to combat the city's crime and drug problem when she, 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl and Police Chief Bob Burgreen meet with the governor 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At an afternoon news conference, McColl said the city's top priority will be to 
request $12 million to fund a 200-bed pre-arraignment jail for three years. The 
jail is envisioned as a privately operated facility aimed at incarcerating the 
more than 100 misdemeanor arrestees who are now cited and released each day 
because of jail crowding. 
</P>
<P>
The city also will ask for money to hire more police officers for special 
anti-gang and drug details, and to fund youth diversion programs. 
</P>
<P>
In May, O'Connor declared that drug- and gang-related shootings had created a 
"state of emergency" in San Diego's inner city. The council asked Deukmejian 
for $34 million from the state's newly discovered $2.5-billion surplus to help 
quell the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian formally rebuffed the request in June, but not before his press 
secretary questioned whether O'Connor's unusual gambit was a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor was flanked by McColl, Burgreen and Councilman Ed Struiksma, members 
of the "emergency council" created after the state-of-emergency declaration, at 
the news conference. O'Connor denied that the event was staged to generate 
publicity for McColl and Struiksma, incumbents who face reelection primaries 
Tuesday.

RESTAURATEUR TO BE TRIED IN BOY'S KILLING

<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Beach restaurateur Roger Sing Ip will stand trial for the shooting 
death of a Mission Bay High School freshman who was fatally wounded after a 
minor traffic altercation. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz on Friday ordered Ip, 34, to stand trial, at 
the conclusion of a three-day preliminary hearing. Domnitz also refused to 
lower Ip's $1-million bail, after commenting that the shooting appeared to be 
unprovoked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to leave bail where it is. . . . I've had three days of testimony 
that puts Mr. Ip at the scene, but I haven't heard anything about provocation," 
Domnitz said. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, Kurt Von Yokes, 15; Michael W. Endsley, 19, and Debbie 
Lichty, 18, were driving home when a red Isuzu Trooper allegedly driven by Ip 
nearly collided with Lichty's car. Words were exchanged and Ip allegedly 
followed the three teen-agers to Endsley's home. 
</P>
<P>
When the youths arrived at Endsley's house, Endsley and Yokes got out of the 
car and stood at the end of the driveway. Endsley and Lichty testified that the 
driver of the Trooper fired one shot and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leena Jariwala, a San Diego County pathologist, testified that the bullet 
entered the right side of Yokes' chest, pierced his heart, both lungs, and 
liver, before exiting through the left side of his chest. Jariwala said the 
youth bled to death. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain said that Ip was a flight risk and argued 
against a bail reduction. Ip, who is from Hong Kong, is a British citizen and 
permanent resident alien of the United States. Ip fled the area after the 
shooting and hid in Los Angeles, before surrendering to San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
Before surrendering, Ip had a passport waiting for him in Los Angeles, McClain 
said. He faces an arraignment hearing Oct. 16.

'FINE-TUNING' THE MEDICARE SURTAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' advice for fine-tuning Medicare's catastrophic insurance is sound. 
However, health insurance for seniors, both government and private, needs a 
complete overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
As a 65 year old who will be paying some percentage of the surtax, I'm not 
complaining. It is a bargain. However, my secondary insurance, retained from my 
job when I retired, already will pay much of what this program does. Better 
over-insured than under-insured, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Some cautious few of us are buying long-term care insurance. Now that's what we 
really need. It's not cheap nor easy to find good policies which can cost from 
$700 to $1,200 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Those seniors who are protesting the surtax -- and those legislators who are 
tip-toeing around the issue -- should spend their energies trying to come up 
with some basic long-term care insurance. A lot of us will willingly pay.

Is Zsa Zsa Gabor trying to prove how far a "has-been" or a "never-was" will go 
to gain publicity? She must live a very boring life if she needs excitement 
this much. Mostly I resent that her nonsense is taking up valuable court time 
and the time of 12 jury members and alternates. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, she was in the wrong if she had no driver's license with her so why 
the big court deal? But maybe 60 days in jail with the "common folk" would wake 
her up. Let's hope she doesn't make a mockery of our court system.

LOWERING CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until Malcolm Forbes was taken aback by public resentment of his big bash in 
Morocco (re: Morris Philipson's "700 Guests Don't Add Up to Fun," Editorial 
Page, Sept. 2), he had expected to declare this as a business expense, as he 
acknowledged. He has a point. 
</P>
<P>
It would be poetic justice if this silly saturnalia helped to kill George 
Bush's capital gains tax cut. In order to make the rich richer, Bush seems to 
be hoping to surpass Ronald Reagan's record of more than doubling our 
deca-millionaires in a scant five years.

The creed of greed is alive and well.

DEBATE OVER FAIRNESS OF PROP. 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jonathan Coupal's column, like Proposition 13 itself, is simple, easy to 
understand, and wrong ("Proposition 13 Has Made Everyone's Tax Reasonable," 
Op-Ed Page, Aug. 29). It is also equivocal. 
</P>
<P>
Property tax laws should not contain "absolute certain(ies)" any more than the 
price of food or fuel should or could be absolutely certain. 
</P>
<P>
Plainly, it is not good social policy to throw people from their homes for 
non-payment of exorbitant taxes; but it is also poor policy to lock in 
assessment increases with no consideration of future budget requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Frank Richardson's "roughly comparable" analogy to sales taxes refutes 
Coupal's point. Sales taxes are directly related to current value. As the cost 
of goods fluctuates, so does the cost of government, and so do sales tax 
collections; to imply that one class of Californian (long-term property owners) 
should be immune to inflation at the expense of others, is not "equal 
protection under the law." 
</P>
<P>
Coupal's argument that everyone's tax is "reasonable" because of an arbitrary 
1% cap ignores the point. If our schools, our hospitals, our fire and police 
are responsive to us all, then we must all pay a fair share. The 1% tax 
currently provides sufficient funds. 
</P>
<P>
But what if housing prices had not so outrageously surpassed inflation to 
provide those funds? Are we to devise a new plan, some new Proposition 13, when 
the real estate rocket levels off? Is that "reasonable"? 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 is a Ponzi scheme, where the new entrants pay the bills of the 
older players. It is "unfair." It is shortsighted. It is not good tax policy.

LOWERING CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing -- not Liz Taylor and Malcolm Forbes' wretched excesses, not Leona 
Helmsley's disgusting defalcations, not Exxon's putrescent piggishness -- 
infuriates me half as much as the proposal to revive the tax exemption on 
capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
By what right does a democratic government tax the wages earned by the honest 
sweat of a citizen's brow at a higher rate than the speculator's windfall gain? 
What is the justification for so gross an inequity? 
</P>
<P>
Abolition of the special treatment for capital gains was one of the few good 
provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The main provision -- and the main 
purpose -- of that misnamed measure was the drastic reduction in the tax rate 
on the highest incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Thus was realized the fond old dream of the very rich -- abolition of the 
progressive income tax. In fact, the new tax rates are retrogressive; the 
incremental rate is 33% for the merely well-off, but only 28% for the really 
well-heeled. Repeal of the capital gains tax giveaway was a small price to pay 
for that bonanza. But now the Bush Administration, in conspiracy with 
congressional wheeler-dealers, is trying to nullify even that small concession 
to fairness. 
</P>
<P>
But this isn't just a low-down Republican plot to rob us poor folk. President 
Bush's chief congressional collaborator is Democrat Dan Rostenkowski. 
Rostenkowski has long been one of the top congressional beneficiaries of the 
largess of groups with a very special interest in tax matters. Small wonder: As 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the birth (or death) bed of all 
tax bills, he has been one of their chief benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
But to return to my earlier question: How do they justify this rip-off? By 
voodoo economics, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Leona was right. Only the little people pay taxes.

'FINE-TUNING' THE MEDICARE SURTAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not enough to "fine-tune" the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, as The 
Times suggested in its editorial defending this law ("All It Needs Is 
Fine-Tuning," Sept. 11). This new program needs a major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of Congress who voted against this bill, I have argued from the 
time its passage was imminent that we should scrap it and start over. Our 
original goal was right: to protect older Americans from the financial 
devastation that a major, long-term illness can cause. But we never achieved 
that goal. Instead of providing help with long-term nursing home or home health 
care -- the costs of which are feared the most by the elderly -- Congress 
provided a number of less essential benefits. It was no surprise that 
beneficiaries objected to paying very substantial fees for them. 
</P>
<P>
The only truly catastrophic benefit of this new law is the unlimited 
hospitalization. The other principal new benefits are help with physicians' 
fees and prescription drug expenses. Large bills in both cases can cause 
hardship, but rarely are the costs "catastrophic," $2,000 worth of doctors' or 
pharmaceutical bills in a year is a modest expense compared to $30,000 for a 
yearlong stay in a typical nursing home, which really is catastrophic for all 
but the most affluent elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many of the elderly have private insurance to pay for the 
hospital, physician, and prescription drug expenses that Medicare does not 
cover, but virtually none have insurance for long-term nursing home and home 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of this new Medicare program has made it all but impossible for 
Congress to address the need for help with the costs of long-term care. Because 
of the huge expenses involved in nursing home or home health care, Congress 
cannot create a federal program to pay for them without asking beneficiaries to 
bear part of the cost. But we will also be hard-pressed to ask recipients to 
pay even higher health care fees after imposing such large premium increases 
and a surtax on the elderly to pay for some of these other, less urgent 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Congress will soon be deciding whether to repeal or merely adjust the financing 
of this new law -- possibly in a way that would be detrimental to low- and 
middle-income elderly. Repeal is the right course: If we go back to square one 
and provide, instead, long-term care benefits -- the true "catastrophic" 
benefits that the elderly need and want the most (and probably thought they 
were getting with this bill) -- we're certain to see a much greater willingness 
on their part to help pay for them.

'FINE-TUNING' THE MEDICARE SURTAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the Administration wants the catastrophic care legislation left untouched 
because the tax revenues generated thereby will help reduce the budget deficit. 
What this amounts to is a new tax on seniors only to pay for a program that 
only a small number will ever use in order to save the federal budget from 
breaching spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
Read my lips on "No new taxes" -- ha!

GIANTS WILL HAVE TO WAIT; PADRES WIN, 5-3

The fans filtered into Candlestick Park Friday night preparing for the funeral. 
This was the night, they figured, that the San Francisco Giants would bury the 
Padres once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
There even was a vase of flowers, seemingly proper for any morning, from an 
anonymous donor awaiting the Padres in the clubhouse upon their arrival Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Just how confident were the Giants before the game? 
</P>
<P>
"For us not to win it now," Giant outfielder Pat Sheridan said, "we'd have to 
be hit by a plague. Look at us. We've got two of the best pitchers in the 
league in Scotty Garrelts and Big Daddy (Rick Reuschel). No one has got two 
better hitters than us with Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, there's no doubt in our mind we're going to win this thing. Our 
biggest concern is if we'll win it by the end of this home stand (concluding 
Sept. 24). We want to have it all wrapped up before we go on the road for those 
last six games." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
But please, hold onto the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, overcoming the collapse of third baseman Bip Roberts and a ball 
that bounced off the noggin of Chris James, defeated the Giants, 5-3, in front 
of 33,920 well-wishers at Candlestick, keeping their faint playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, the Padres' 18th in their past 22 games, moved them back to within 
five games of the Giants with a precious 14 remaining. The Padres say they 
still need to sweep this three-game series, but Act 1 is complete, leaving 
today's confrontation as the latest biggest game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It hardly was easy, and the hard, cold facts of the outcome were that it might 
prove to be quite costly. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, whom Padre Manager Jack McKeon was acclaiming before the game as the 
man most responsible for the Padres' surge into the pennant race, collapsed 
screaming in anguish in the dugout in the middle of the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
He complained before the game of a mysterious pain in his left side that first 
arose Wednesday while putting on a sweatshirt. It was diagnosed as muscle 
spasms, but Roberts was not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even raise my arm above my head," Roberts said. "It just doesn't seem 
to be getting any better, and really, there's not much I can do at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll keep on playing. I'll play until they have to carry me out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Well, in the fifth, they had to do just that when Roberts collapsed on the 
bench and was carried from the dugout on a stretcher into the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis was a rib-cage muscle spasm. Roberts was taken to San Francisco 
General Hospital, where he was scheduled to spend the night for observation and 
evaluation. Padre officials said that they do not believe the injury is 
serious, and that Roberts was feeling comfortable and breathing normally. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was just a coincidence. But after the Padres quietly watched Roberts 
being carried off the field, it appeared to inspire them. 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Dennis Rasmussen shut down the Giants one-two-three in the bottom 
of the fifth, and the Padres broke open the game in the top of the sixth, 
scoring three runs for a 5-2 lead that they never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
Chris James, who entered hitting .167 (six for 36) in his past 11 games, opened 
the sixth with a single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Templeton followed with a double into the right-field corner, scoring 
James. 
</P>
<P>
And Benito Santiago completed the one-two-three punch by lining a zero-and-two 
pitch into the left-field seats for a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
It was Santiago's seventh homer in his past 22 games, including his 
eighth-inning homer Wednesday in the Padres' 3-2 victory over Atlanta, and it 
hushed the crowd for the rest of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres know they still have a long way to go and still cannot be taken off 
the critical list, but at least for another day, the pulse is steady. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to take them one game at a time," McKeon said. "We had to win the 
first one, and we did. Now, we'll concentrate on the second one. We're not 
going to look ahead any further than that." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Padres' much-needed victory, there was a bonus: Gwynn went three 
for five in the game and passed Will Clark (zero for three) for the National 
League batting lead. Gwynn, bidding for his third consecutive batting title, is 
batting .341, Clark .339. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't give a damn about the batting title," Gwynn said. "Not now. I 
just want to win. And I want to win bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, that's the only thing on my mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd sacrifice all of my batting titles, and all my future batting titles, for 
a championship." 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark, who took over the batting lead Sept. 6, likewise said the batting 
race is the least of his concerns. Not now. Not when the Giants are so close to 
winning the title now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in good shape," Clark said. "Actually, we're in great shape. 
There's no pressure on us. We control our own destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres indeed were under a lot of stress, they failed to show it, 
overcoming a 1-0 deficit in the second, and taking a 2-1 lead in the third. 
</P>
<P>
It was Roberts who led off the rally with a walk. Roberto Alomar followed by 
hitting a ball to the warning track in center. Although center fielder Brett 
Butler was under the ball, he looked at left fielder Kevin Mitchell at the last 
second, and the ball dropped between them. Alomar wound up at second, and 
Roberts at third. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn grounded out to first, scoring Roberts, while Alomar moved to third. With 
the Giant infield playing in, Jack Clark failed to get the ball past him, 
grounding out to shortstop Jose Uribe, who held Alomar at third. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. James ripped a three-and-two pitch into right-center for a triple, 
scoring Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants came right back in the bottom of the third and tied the game on 
right fielder Gwynn's fielding blunder. Robbie Thompson led off the inning with 
a single into right field. Gwynn ran over to pick it up. Oops. The ball 
trickled through his legs. Thompson kept running until he reached third. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, the official scorer ruled it a triple, perhaps revealing just why 
Thompson leads the league with 11 this season. Will Clark wasted little time 
driving him in with a sacrifice fly to deep center field, tying the game at 
two. 
</P>
<P>
After the Padres scored three runs in the sixth, the Giants threatened to come 
right back when Mitchell and Matt Williams opened the sixth with back-to-back 
doubles. Greg Harris came in for relief, and calmly finished out the game, 
recording his fifth save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Security officials at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium estimated about 6,000 
people were in attendance by 8 p.m. Friday as the Padres-Giants game was shown 
on the Diamond Vision scoreboard. . . . Padre pitcher Ed Whitson, who left the 
game Thursday night after 2 1/3 innings with a mild strain of the bicep tendon 
in his right shoulder, was given a injection Friday to reduce the swelling. "I 
should be all right in about two or three days," Whitson said. "The doctors 
told me I just have a tired arm. I haven't had an extra day off in months, and 
I think it just wore on me." . . . Whitson's injury has put his growing cap 
collection on hold. There are 16 caps, consisting primarily of college teams, 
sitting atop Whitson's locker. They represent each of his 16 victories this 
season. The next one, Whitson said, will be a cap from the University of 
Alabama, with Florida, Mississippi and LSU caps waiting in reserve. "I must 
have four boxes of caps at home." 
</P>
<P>
Also hurting is third baseman Bip Roberts, who has a mysterious pain in his 
left side. It's been diagnosed as muscle spasms, but whatever it is, Roberts 
said, it's keeping him from raising his left arm above his head. "There's not 
much I can do at the plate," Roberts said, "but I'll keep going out there." . . 
. Padre Manager Jack McKeon, still marveling over rookie pitcher Andy Benes, 
who is 4-0 with a 2.88 ERA in his past five starts, said: "He reminds me so 
much of Dennis Leonard (the former Kansas City Royal 20-game winner), only this 
kid's got better stuff at the same stage in their careers. He might even be 
tougher. The thing I like about him is that he throws inside. He won't back 
down to anybody. . . . I'll tell you what, the way the kid's pitching now, I 
wouldn't hesitate to start him in the first game of the playoffs if we got 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Padre third baseman Mike Pagliarulo, visiting Candlestick Park for the first 
time in his career after spending the past 4 1/2 years in the American League: 
"The thing I hate about going to these new places is that I always have to ask 
where the bathroom is." . . . Pagliarulo was kept out of the starting lineup 
for the sixth straight game, replaced by Roberts at third, with Darrin Jackson 
playing center. . . . In backup catcher Mark Parent's past five at-bats since 
Aug. 27, he has four hits with one homer, one double and six RBIs. . . . The 
Giant bullpen has 44 saves -- three shy of their record set in 1983. . . . The 
Giants have 16 shutouts, their most since 1978, when they had 17. . . . The 
Padres will play the second game of their three-game series against the Giants 
at 1:05 p.m. today at Candlestick Park. Calvin Schiraldi (5-6) and Scott 
Garrelts are the scheduled starters.

DAVE DISTEL: PADRES FINALLY GET TO PLAY GIANT KILLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To suggest that the heat of a pennant race arrived at Candlestick Park Friday 
night would be an exaggeration. Nothing involving Candlestick relates to heat 
in any sense. 
</P>
<P>
However, in all fairness to Candlestick, the pennant race which came to visit 
is merely lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
What we had was the opening of a three-game series between The Team That Can't 
Lose and The Team That Won't Lose. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have been out of touch with the National League West for the last 
few weeks, let me identify these teams: 
</P>
<P>
Can't Lose -- The Padres came to San Francisco with absolutely no margin for 
error because the Giants . . . 
</P>
<P>
Won't Lose -- Not when they were down, 8-0, in Cincinnati a couple of weeks 
back. Not when they were down, 7-5, in the 13th inning a couple of nights ago. 
Not when they were going 12 excruciating innings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, though the Padres have veritably been trying to will the Giants to lose 
from afar, this hometown's heroes have been pulling win after win out of their 
earmuffs. 
</P>
<P>
How many times in just the last few weeks have the Padres left the ballpark 
thinking they have trimmed another game off the Giants' lead? 
</P>
<P>
"Looked like we'd gained a game is right," said Tony Gwynn. "But those guys 
keep bouncing back." 
</P>
<P>
Though Padre fans will probably relate more to those 25 innings worth of giant 
Giant wins over Cincinnati Wednesday night and Thursday afternoon, San 
Francisco's comeback from that 8-0 deficit at Cincinnati Sept. 4 was probably 
the one both the Padres and Giants will remember longest. 
</P>
<P>
If you recall, the Padres had done a little miracle-making of their own that 
day. Jack Clark's two home runs and seven runs batted in had erased an 8-3 
deficit in Atlanta and produced a 10-9 win. They knew they had trimmed a game 
off the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
No way the Giants could come back. 
</P>
<P>
Even Roger Craig had kissed his regulars good-bye and sent them to the showers. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Will Clark and Terry Kennedy to bat one more time and go on in," Craig 
said. "They both hit home runs and then everybody I put in contributed. It was 
amazing." 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that the Padres, for all of Jack Clark's heroics, simply treaded 
water for another day. 
</P>
<P>
It has made scoreboard-watching a frustrating exercise for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been playing great," Craig said, "but we've been playing pretty good 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres went into the weekend series with 17 wins in their last 21 games, 
but the Giants had won 11 of their last 15. Instead of taking large bites out 
of the deficit, the Padres have had to settle for frustratingly modest nibbles. 
</P>
<P>
And then, just on the eve of this series, the Padres slipped from five behind 
to six behind. The Giants came up with their second straight extra-inning win, 
and the Padres were blown out by Atlanta, 13-4. 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing how gigantic the difference is between six out and five out. 
</P>
<P>
But the Padres still came here with a dream. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not impossible," Tim Flannery said early in the evening, "but we do have 
our work cut out for us. We really have nothing to lose if we can pull this 
off. If we can do it, it will be something people will talk about and never 
forget. If they don't do it, it would be one of the all-time fold jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure, Flannery said, is on the Giants rather than the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"They know it," he said, "and we know it." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. No one really expects the Padres to come back and win this thing. A 
lot of people down in San Diego are hoping, but certainly not expecting. 
</P>
<P>
However, it would be stretching it a bit to suggest that the Giants are feeling 
a whole lot of pressure. If the Padres are looking at a window of opportunity, 
it is not much bigger than a porthole. Let the Padres cut the deficit to three 
and maybe the Giants would start squirming. 
</P>
<P>
Craig, for one, seemed to almost welcome the notion that this is a critical 
series. It's almost as if he is thinking it wouldn't really be right to win a 
division championship without one. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that's too bad, as much as I love San Diego, is that it boils 
down to us playing them for the championship," he said. "But that's the way it 
goes in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Craig was not being facetious. He lives in San Diego and really does love San 
Diego. His first managerial job was with the Padres, and he almost returned to 
the organization between his "retirement" as Detroit's pitching coach and his 
"comeback" as the Giants' manager. 
</P>
<P>
But, really Roger, there is no way this series can be considered crucial for 
the Giants unless they choose to look at it as the time to dispose of the last 
pesky obstacle on their path to the post-season. 
</P>
<P>
For the Padres, it is an entirely different story. 
</P>
<P>
What they have is an opportunity, which is more than they could have imagined 
only a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"You play all year to get here," said Flannery. "This is what you go to spring 
training to work for. A series like this is what you play for." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Giants were no longer an illusion to be chased from afar. For the 
first time in their incredible run, the Padres do not need to gaze longingly at 
the scoreboard and hope someone helps them with the Giants. Finally, the Padres 
have come to a time when they can help only themselves.

OILERS TRY TO MAKE IT A MOBILE HOUSE OF PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was late in the 1987 season, and captains of the Houston Oilers and 
Indianapolis Colts met at midfield before a game at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the House of Pain," said Oiler linebacker Robert Lyles, coining the 
term that symbolizes the image of the bad boys of the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the Oilers have confined their intimidating tactics to 
their home AstroTurf. Having been a notoriously poor team away from Houston, 
they declared before this season began, "We've got to take the spirit of the 
House of Pain on the road." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers absorbed a 38-7 pounding from the Minnesota Vikings in their season 
opener in Minneapolis but got in enough licks along the way to send a message 
to the Chargers in advance of Sunday's game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
As the score against Coach Jerry Glanville's team mounted in the second half, 
safety Tracey Eaton was called for two personal fouls, Lyles for one. The 
Oilers were penalized 13 times for 98 yards, putting them ahead of their 
league-leading 1,150-yard pace of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Before that game, Viking Coach Jerry Burns warned his players about the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to them if this were a street fight, I'd bet on them, but it's not," 
Burns said in a story in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. "I don't want them 
retaliating to any chippy play or late hits, because 100% of the time, the guy 
who retaliates is the one who gets the flag." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the game was over, his team's lopsided victory notwithstanding, 
Burns was convinced that the Oilers had lived up to their tawdry reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Burns: "I was impressed by the way our players kept their poise, even 
though Houston tried to intimidate us and was guilty of a lot of late hits. 
</P>
<P>
"There was holding of our wide receivers, late hits on our quarterback, late 
hits on players who were down. That type of play hurts a team in the long run. 
It hurt any chance they had of coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Viking linebacker Mark Dusbabek, who was on the Oilers' injured reserve list in 
1987 and 1988, denied Glanville had encouraged the Oilers to take cheap shots. 
</P>
<P>
"They play hard, aggressive football," Dusbabek said. "Coach Glanville has 
never coached his players to play dirty. They swarm to the ball but play within 
the rules. This upsets some people." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it upsets a lot of people, and none more than Pittsburgh Coach Chuck 
Noll. Ever since the Steeler-Oiler game of Nov. 15, 1987, Noll has given 
Glanville a priority rating on his hate list. 
</P>
<P>
In that game, defensive end Charles Martin of the Oilers speared running back 
Earnest Jackson of the Steelers, forcing Jackson to leave with bruised ribs. 
Martin is the same guy who the previous year put a body slam on Chicago 
quarterback Jim McMahon, now with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson charged Martin with a cheap shot, and Noll said, "If the league doesn't 
do something about their spearing, we may go spearing ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
When the Steelers and Oilers met again a few weeks later, Noll grabbed 
Glanville with one hand and pointed a finger at him with the other. Glanville 
tried to yank his hand away, but Noll held on tight. 
</P>
<P>
"Your damn guys jumping people, that's going to get your butt in trouble," Noll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the league meetings in March 1988, Noll described the Oilers' tactics as 
"worse than anything I saw in the Steelers-Raiders rivalry in the '70s." He 
referred to the time he labeled certain Raiders as "a criminal element." 
</P>
<P>
Noll added, "I don't think the game should be played that way. There are 
players on that team (Oilers) who are trying to do something with hits that are 
meant to end players' careers." 
</P>
<P>
Glanville reacted by saying, "That's a total, complete lie. Nobody on this team 
has ever been told to do that. We don't go after anybody's knee, ever. Noll 
ought to look at how he lost that game with Cleveland rather than look at us." 
</P>
<P>
In that game, the 1987 regular-season finale, Steeler cornerback Delton Hall 
was ejected for a flagrant personal foul. That penalty set up the Browns' 
winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Noll didn't deny that Hall had been out of line but said, "Teams have led the 
league in personal fouls wherever Glanville has been in the past. They have the 
philosophy that the officials will get tired of throwing flags." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Oilers were called cheap-shot artists as far back as 1985, the 
year after Glanville took over as coach. In an exhibition against the Rams, 
Oiler safety Bo Eason dived over the pile on a blitz and hit Ram quarterback 
Dieter Brock in such a way that Brock suffered a knee injury. Ram Coach John 
Robinson complained. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth game of the 1987 regular season, the Denver Broncos set an NFL 
record with 11 first downs on penalties against the Oilers. Several Denver 
players blasted the Oilers for what they characterized as cheap shots. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody said much about the Oilers in 1986, perhaps because they lost 11 of 16 
games, including eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, though, several San Francisco 49ers told their teammates to "keep 
their heads on swivels" to watch out for the Oilers. While nothing untoward 
happened in that game, the Steeler-Oiler confrontation came a week later. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Colts felt the Oilers' sting while drubbing them, 51-27. After 
a late touchdown, Oiler cornerback Patrick Allen nailed Colt kicker Dean 
Biasucci on the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers thought the Colts had poured it on, but the league office didn't 
look at Allen's act that way. It fined him $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after that, Oiler linebacker Walter Johnson leveled kicker New 
Orleans kicker Morten Andersen on a kickoff. Coach Jim Mora of the Saints 
charged Johnson with a cheap shot; ironically, Johnson now plays for him. 
</P>
<P>
After that incident, the Saints kept a man back to protect Andersen, one of 
their most valuable commodities. He missed two field goals, but the Saints won 
anyway, 24-10. 
</P>
<P>
On and on it went. In the 1987 playoffs, Oiler linebacker John Grimsley made a 
late hit on Bronco wide receiver Vance Johnson and knocked him out of the AFC 
championship game with a groin injury. At least Grimsley said he was sorry, 
conveying his regrets to Johnson in a visit to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Besides their actions on the field, the Oilers have incurred opponents' wrath 
by shouting insults. They seemingly have developed a "we-against-the-world" 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Heisler of The Times wrote last December: "The Oilers dote on the outlaw 
image they've worked so hard to acquire." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reilly wrote in the Jan. 2 Sports Illustrated: "It's a team that spats 
with its own fans and the local press, a team with a headhunter rep, a team 
whose uniforms come equipped with shoulder chips." 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the real hitting in football is done by tacklers, the Oilers' 
defense has been targeted with a great majority of the accusations. Their 
special teams also have gotten into the act. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the Oilers' allegedly dirty play were directed to center Don 
Macek and wide receiver Anthony Miller of the Chargers. Macek gave the Oilers a 
pass; Miller didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Macek said, "I don't know if they live up to their reputation of being 
cheap-shot artists. Their concept of defense is blitzing, attacking, somewhat 
of a gambling style. There's nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
Miller: "Sometimes they take cheap shots. You just have to forget about that 
and play hard. I won't let it affect my attitude going into this game." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Oilers themselves, a remark by cornerback Steve Brown probably sums 
up the philosophy of their defense. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was quoted in SI as saying, "I'm aggressive. Sometimes a head gets in the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, this approach has not met with full approval from the Oilers on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Warren Moon told The Times' Heisler, "Who does it come back to 
hurt? Us, the offense. It just gets the other team's defense fired up." 
</P>
<P>
Moon elaborated this week. 
</P>
<P>
"On defense, we play a more swarming style," Moon said. "When you're asked to 
run to the ball and get in on every tackle, you're going to get some late hits 
now and then. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we have to get a little bit smarter and not take those cheap 
shots. You have to back off and just let the guy go out of bounds."

Bruin heaven '89 lasted less than a week, from about Jeff George's last pass to 
the end of the third quarter of that 6-24 Tennessee nightmare on Linda Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the opener was a complete aberration, the Bruins are in a lot more 
trouble than the Trojans, who were basically beaten because of a fluke tipped 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was run over, flattened, humiliated, and not by Oklahoma or Nebraska, but 
by what is very probably a middling SEC team with not much of a passer. How 
could it happen? 
</P>
<P>
My suspicion is that Terry Donahue used a straight-up defensive approach, and 
when Bret Johnson and the offense started having trouble with the Vols' 
defensive pressure, the game was gone. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the Bruins asked for it. This might have been one of those rare 
times Terry didn't worry enough.

<P>
Year in, year out, win or lose, Terry Donahue coaches a brand of football best 
described as ho-hum. 
</P>
<P>
Along with my bifocals and my rocking chair and my lap blanket, I have fond 
memories of the most exciting football I ever saw, coached by those unique 
masters -- Tommy Prothro and Red Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
What terrific leaders. Tricky devils with strange, detached senses of humor, 
they got the most out of their troops with flair, intelligence and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, down at the Rose Bowl, we see computerized clones going through the 
motions designed by those with furrowed foreheads. They are worrywarts, fueled 
by fear, who long ago lost touch with the essence of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, give me back my gutty little Bruins of yore.

EDUCATOR SAYS SAT DESIGNED TO BE FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Marchiano's excellent article on young athletes affected by the NCAA's 
Proposition 48 shows how important it is to help these students prepare for 
college earlier, and to help them realize what adequate preparation entails. 
</P>
<P>
Should Marchiano's article give readers the impression that the SAT is biased 
against black and other minority students, let me state emphatically that this 
is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
Before a question appears on an SAT, it is scrupulously reviewed and analyzed 
by a racially and ethnically diverse panel of experts, then pre-tested by 
thousands of students under real-test conditions to detect the slightest sign 
of "item bias." It is used in a real SAT only if it is fair for students of 
similar ability of any race, ethnic background or gender.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
PIRATES' SPOILER ROLE SOURS AS CUBS EXTEND WINNING STREAK TO SIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates, who were out of the National League East race by early 
May, are having quite a bit to say about who will win the division. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend the Pirates, hampered by injuries most of the season, gave the New 
York Mets a jolt by winning two out of three in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week they put the St. Louis Cardinals into a tailspin by sweeping 
a three-game series at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Then along came the Chicago Cubs. But the story was different Friday night at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Shawon Dunston hit his first grand slam and the Cubs beat the 
Pirates, 7-2, for their sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sutcliffe (15-5) complained earlier in the week of a sore right arm, but 
he didn't pitch as though there was a problem. Although he gave up nine hits in 
eight innings, he struck out 10 and became the third Cub pitcher -- after Greg 
Maddux and Mike Bielecki -- to reach the 15-victory mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates were hanging tough through five innings. But with the score, 1-1, 
Manager Jim Leyland lifted Neal Heaton, starting after only three days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the trouble began. A walk, an error and another walk finished 
rookie Stan Belinda (0-1). He was replaced by Bob Patterson, who retired one 
batter Thursday to get the victory over the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Luis Salazar then beat out an infield hit to break the tie and 
Dunston hit an 0-and-1 pitch into the left-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
Said Leyland, whose club was eliminated from the race: "It looks like they're 
going to win it. They're the best team in the division by far now. That's why 
they're far out in front. They had a good club in the spring and they knew it. 
</P>
<P>
"Their one problem was whether they could hold leads. And Mitch Williams and 
Les Lancaster have given them the support from the bullpen to win it." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, San Francisco 3 -- Garry Templeton drove in the tiebreaking run in 
the sixth inning with a double and Benito Santiago followed with a two-run 
homer, leading the Padres at San Francisco as they pulled within five games of 
the first-place Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have five games remaining with the Giants, two more this weekend at 
Candlestick Park and the final three of the season at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have won 18 of 22 to move into the race. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen (9-10) won his fourth game in his last five decisions, 
allowing six hits in five-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Knepper (7-12) lost for the first time since Aug. 12 and is 2-2 since 
joining the Giants after his release from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, who has 13 homers this season, has seven in his last 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' Bip Roberts was carried out of the Padres' dugout on a stretcher in 
the fifth inning when he experienced spasms in his rib cage. He was taken to a 
hospital for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Montreal 0 -- Keith Hernandez kept the Mets alive in the East race. 
</P>
<P>
David Cone (13-7) gave up seven hits in eight innings at Montreal to hand the 
faltering Expos their fifth consecutive loss. Dennis Martinez held the Mets 
hitless until Darryl Strawberry singled to open the fourth. Hernandez, 
sidelined much of the season because of a broken kneecap, hit his fourth home 
run of the season and first since April 28. That was enough support for Cone. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, who has not hit a home run since Aug. 16, drove in only his fifth 
run in the last 25 games with a sacrifice fly in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have 16 games to play but play the Cubs only twice, next Monday and 
Tuesday at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 2-6, St. Louis 0-7 -- When the Cardinals left Chicago Sunday they 
were 2 1/2 games out of first and getting ready to play the two worst teams in 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
But Philadelphia and Pittsburgh proceeded to knock the Cardinals out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
When rookie Pat Combs (2-0) pitched a four-hitter in the opener at 
Philadelphia, it was the Cardinals' sixth consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Despite two home runs by Von Hayes, the Cardinals scored two runs in the ninth 
to get a split. However, they trail the Cubs by six games with 15 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero, who hit his 16th home run of the season in the first inning of 
the second game, started the rally with a single. The tying run came in on a 
passed ball, and Milt Thompson's infield hit drove in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Combs extended his string since coming up from the minors to one 
earned run in 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 4, Cincinnati 1 -- Glenn Davis' 33rd home run helped Rick Rhoden to his 
second victory of the season in this game at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Only Jimmy Wynn, who hit 37 in 1969, has hit more home runs for Houston in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden (2-6) gave up only two hits in seven innings. DAN HAFNER

SURPRISING YOUNG ORIOLES HANG TOUGH AND DEFEAT ROYALS, 5-2

<P>
The surprising young Baltimore Orioles continue to hang on in the American 
League East. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Worthington singled home the tiebreaking run in the sixth inning at 
Baltimore and rookie Gregg Olson came to the rescue again Friday night as the 
Orioles beat the Kansas City Royals, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept Manager Frank Robinson's club just 1 1/2 games behind the 
Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, who have moved into contention in the West, blew an opportunity to 
close in on the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
In five of the first seven innings, the Royals put two runners on base against 
Bob Milacki (11-12). They had 11 hits before Olson took over after a leadoff 
single in the ninth, retired three batters in a row and earned his 26th save. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the game, I really struggled with the strike zone," Milacki said. "I 
just made good pitches when it was absolutely necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles know they have to face the two Kansas City pitchers, Mark Gubicza 
and Bret Saberhagen, in the last two games with the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed this one," Robinson said. "I really like the way Milacki battled 
them. The next two games we have to play two of the best. Maybe Gubicza and 
Saberhagen will bring out the best in this club. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really proud of the way this team has battled after what we went through 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Cleveland 2 -- At Toronto, left-hander Jimmy Key (12-13) and the 
bullpen sparkled and George Bell and seldom-used Ozzie Virgil hit home runs as 
the Blue Jays ended a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Key gave up six hits and two runs in 5 1/3 innings. Tom Henke, the third 
reliever, pitched a perfect ninth inning to get his 17th save. 
</P>
<P>
Bell hit his 18th home run with two out in the first. After Fred McGriff drew 
his 102nd walk, Virgil, who spent most of the season in the minors, hit his 
first home run in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always nice to come home," Blue Jay Manager Cito Gaston said. "Not that 
the road trip was a disappointment. Anytime you go 6-4 on the road, you can't 
be too upset." 
</P>
<P>
His lineup changes involved Virgil and Tom Lawless at third. Lawless had a hit 
and scored a run. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to get a chance to play," Virgil said. "The Blue Jays gave me a 
chance first at Syracuse. Up here, Gaston isn't afraid to use his bench." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 7, Oakland 2 -- It has not been an outstanding season for Roger Clemens, 
but the Red Sox right-hander can still be tough. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens (15-10) gave up a first-inning home run to Jose Canseco but not much 
else as the Red Sox ended their eight-game losing streak with a victory at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who has played less than one-third of a season because of a wrist 
injury, hit his 15th home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody on this team is lying down," Clemens said. "We have to 
go out and prove it against teams such as the A's." 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics lead the West by 3 1/2 games over both Kansas City and the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 3, New York 1 -- Rookie Erik Hanson pitched a two-hitter at New York as 
the Mariners handed the Yankees their fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hits off Hanson (7-5) was Roberto Kelly's ninth home run in the 
eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Coles' 10th home run in the fifth inning started the Mariners on their 
way to their fourth win in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 8, Detroit 4 -- Greg Gagne homered, doubled and drove in two runs at 
Minneapolis to hand the Tigers their 14th road loss in 15 games. Kirby Puckett 
had two hits for the Twins, raising his average to .336. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins won their fourth in a row and moved into fourth place in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 6, Texas 2 -- Charlie O'Brien hit his fifth home run to open the 
third inning at Milwaukee and it triggered a six-run rally that led the Brewers 
to their seventh win in the last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Jaime Navarro (6-7) held the fading Rangers to five hits and an unearned 
run through eight innings, but he needed help in the ninth. DAN HAFNER

ROBITAILLE'S TWO GOALS HELP KINGS TIE QUEBEC IN WEBSTER'S DEBUT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luc Robitaille scored two goals as the Kings came from behind to give Coach Tom 
Webster a 3-3 tie with Quebec in his debut in an exhibition game here Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he felt relieved to have his first game as the Kings' coach behind 
him, Webster said: "Hell, yes. My palms just stopped sweating." 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille had no complaints about Webster's decision to try him as the left 
winger on Wayne Gretzky's line. Early in training camp Webster settled upon the 
Kings' acquisition from Sweden, Mikael Lindholm, as Gretzky's right winger. 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques led, 2-0, when Robitaille scored in the second period. Joe Sakic 
put the Nordiques ahead, 3-1, on a power play goal later in the period. 
Robitaille cut the lead to 3-2 just 11 seconds into the final period, and Craig 
Duncanson (who played most of last season in New Haven) tied the game at 3:55. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bjugstad needed some stitches over his left eye after he was hit by a 
puck early in the second period Friday night, but he returned to play. . . 
.Bernie Nicholls sat this game out while his right winger, Dave Taylor, 
recovered from an injury. . . .Larry Robinson sat out the first game but is 
expected to play tonight in Cincinnati against the New York Rangers. . . .Barry 
Beck, who hasn't played a game since March of 1986 because of shoulder 
problems, is expected to play his first game with the Kings Monday in Cleveland 
. . . .Among the other King veterans who chose to sit out the first game were 
Jim Fox and Chris Kontos.

NOTRE DAME ROUGHS UP KENNEDY, 31-8

<P>
Conventional wisdom holds that City Section teams have better football talent 
and Southern Section schools are more disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
That theory took a beating Friday night at Notre Dame High. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame came out, flexed its muscles and manhandled Kennedy, 31-8, in a 
nonleague game. However, the Knights also were called for 14 penalties totaling 
131 yards. The Cougars were assessed six penalties for 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They're playing aggressively," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said of his 
players. "Maybe it's the way we're teaching them." Whatever the case, the 
Knights had three touchdowns nullified by penalty, including runs of 27 and 64 
yards by standout tailback Errol Small. 
</P>
<P>
Small, who gained 213 yards in last week's win over Alemany, still managed 122 
yards and a touchdown in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The game was billed as a showdown of sorts between Small and Kennedy running 
back Ontiwaun Carter. 
</P>
<P>
However, the match-up was all but forgotten when the Knights scored on their 
first four possessions to take a 28-0 lead early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Small's four-yard scoring run gave Notre Dame a 28-0 lead with 9:08 left in the 
first half. The drive was set up on the first play of the second quarter when 
Carter fumbled on his own 35. 
</P>
<P>
Carter started slowly, gaining only eight yards in four first-quarter carries. 
However, he finished with 157 yards in 21 rushes. But while Carter 
statistically won the battle of backs, 44 of his yards came on a draw with the 
Knights in deep coverage on the game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
The teams played on almost even terms after Notre Dame took a 21-0 lead after 
the first quarter. Perhaps it was the 7:30 start. City games normally begin at 
8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a time warp," Golden Cougar Coach Bob Francola said. "I was proud 
of our kids from midway through the second quarter on." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (2-0) entered with the advantage of having started preseason 
practice earlier and the Knights also had a game under their belts. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I schedule teams like these," Francola said. "I want to do well in 
our conference and they're a good team. When I saw them play Alemany last week, 
I was scared." 
</P>
<P>
Francola's fears were well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Greg Andrachick's seven-yard bootleg accounted for Notre Dame's 
first touchdown. Fano Malieitulua followed that with a six-yard scoring run.

FRESH ERA OF WINNING BEGINS AT CRESPI, 21-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crespi High's post-Bill Redell, post-Russell White, post-high-powered offense 
era posted its first victory Friday night, smothering Hart and talented 
quarterback Rob Westervelt, 21-13, in a nonleague game at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts posted no impressive offensive statistics -- such as the ones White 
registered in three seasons as an All-American tailback before graduating and 
heading to Cal this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bill Canalez completed 12 of 20 passes for 106 yards and one 
touchdown. Tailback Lucas Freeman, the game's leading rusher, gained 57 yards 
in 14 carries, including a 25-yard touchdown run in the second quarter to give 
Crespi a 14-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Crespi totaled just 201 yards offense -- 93 on an option pass from 
running back Jerry Thompson to wide receiver Zach Rayner early in the third 
quarter that gave the Celts a 21-7 lead and broke Hart's back. 
</P>
<P>
"By no means did we do anything impressive on the offensive side of the 
football," said first-year Coach Tim Lins, who replaced Redell this season. "We 
figured we had to win this one with defense." 
</P>
<P>
And that the Celts emphatically did, smothering Westervelt into 
ineffectiveness. The Celts intercepted four of the highly touted quarterback's 
passes -- including the final three he attempted -- while sacking him four 
times for 40 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt completed just seven of 23 passes for 93 yards -- 43 on a 
third-quarter bomb to Lance Migita to pull Hart to within 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw some things at us that we weren't prepared for," Hart Coach Mike 
Herrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Like blitzing linebackers -- lots of them. The blitzes caused havoc from Hart's 
first series on, and the finishing touch came on a blitz by linebacker 
Christian Fauria in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
While Hart was playing catch-up, Fauria flattened Westervelt with a full-speed, 
blind-side sack. 
</P>
<P>
"All out!" Fauria said of the play. "The coaches said, 'Go after 'em,' so . . . 
It was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Said a somber Westervelt: "A hit's a hit." 
</P>
<P>
For good measure, Fauria caught six passes for 66 yards, including an 11-yard 
touchdown reception that gave Crespi (1-1) a 7-0 lead on the game's opening 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why people don't think we're any good this season." Fauria 
said. "I think we're the best team in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Lins would not go as far but insisted that the post-Redell and post-White Celts 
are for real. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to focus on the past and what happened when Russell was here," 
he said. "That brought us publicity, but that's in the past. We like to focus 
on what's happening now." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi made things happen early when Rayner recovered an onside kickoff to 
start the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts moved 49 yards in eight plays to take a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Canalez completed passes of eight, six and 22 yards before hitting Fauria for 
the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
On Crespi's next series, however, Canalez, who completed seven of 12 for 80 
yards in the half, threw an interception on a deep out pattern. The ball was 
returned from the 50-yard line to the one by John DePaco. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, fullback Scott Renfro pulled Hart even with a one-yard dive.

A RAGE IN THE CAGE; 
</P>
<P>
WALKER DEVELOPED NOTABLE SOFTBALL SKILLS BY TAKING SWINGS IN OWN BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dream birthday presents for the average 16-year-old Valley girl -- six pounds 
of mascara, a cellular phone, a private audience with Bon Jovi, a foreign 
sports car -- weren't even on Karen Walker's wish list. She wanted her own 
back-yard batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
"She could have had a car," her mother says, "but she chose the cage." 
</P>
<P>
That was six years ago. Even without her own car, she still managed to get to 
the Galleria. Meanwhile, her personal fast-pitch softball pitching slave 
drilled enough fat ones over the middle to help her become All-Pacific 10 
Conference at UCLA and a member of the gold medal team at this summer's U.S. 
Olympic Festival in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Had Karen selected the car and not worked on her swing, all the Walkers -- a 
family of six -- might have seen less of the country. Playing in the 
stratosphere of women's fast-pitch softball -- including summers in the 
American Softball Assn. major league -- Walker was making long trips 11 months 
of the year. Her family followed her everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We only missed two college games, when UCLA played up in Oregon," says Janette 
Walker, who has seen her daughter play hundreds of games coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
The batting cage still stands under a tall pine in the Walkers' Woodland Hills 
back yard. But fallen needles have collected like thatch on the netting and the 
pitching machine has been borrowed by one of her brothers, Kirk, an assistant 
women's softball coach at UCLA. At 22, with no college eligibility remaining, 
Walker is going through softball withdrawal. Her career -- and the pace of her 
family's life -- have slowed considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Starting this month, Walker will be finishing her undergraduate degree in 
kinesiology at UCLA, concentrating on just school for the first time. "I've 
played softball year-round since I've been 13," she says, "so I'm kind of 
excited to be a regular student. I also want to try other sports like 
volleyball and inner-tube water polo and golf. It's sad I can't play softball 
any more, but I'm looking forward to doing other things." 
</P>
<P>
Walker wasn't always so consumed by softball. As a child, she preferred playing 
with Barbie dolls. But she grew up in the wrong neighborhood -- one with lots 
of little boys, including her three older brothers. "I never wanted to play 
sports with them," she says, "but they always dragged me out." Depending on the 
sport, "They made me hike (the football) or play right field." 
</P>
<P>
When she was 7, she followed in her brothers' cleat marks and played organized 
softball at a park in Woodland Hills. It wasn't long before she traded Barbie 
for a fielder's glove. "The boys liked it that I was good," she says, "but I 
didn't like to show them up." 
</P>
<P>
At 13, Walker found herself playing on a summer traveling team, the San 
Fernando Valley Shilos. She went to ninth grade at San Fernando Valley Academy 
in Northridge but left because the school didn't have a sports program. At El 
Camino Real High, she started at shortstop for three years, becoming co-City 
player of the year as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, but I never really dreamed of playing softball," says Walker, a 
5-6 blue-eyed blonde. "I never even planned on playing college ball. But 
opportunities just seemed to keep opening up." 
</P>
<P>
Walker jumped at the chance to play with the Brakettes, a Stratford, Conn., 
team that has won 20 of the past 30 ASA women's national titles. The team won 
the gold in this year's Olympic Festival but finished second in the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
A clutch hitter who bats over .300, Walker has been a Brakette for the past 
three summers. She was recruited by one of the players, Sharon Backus, co-coach 
of the UCLA women's team. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was bothered by injuries her last two years at UCLA when the Bruins won 
back-to-back NCAA Division I titles. A knee injury in her junior year required 
surgery and a collision this season caused a major contusion on her leg. But 
she was known for her physical toughness. 
</P>
<P>
"Many other athletes would have just succumbed with injuries like those," says 
UCLA co-coach Sue Enquist, who also played for the Brakettes. "But Karen has 
the biggest heart of any player I've seen here at UCLA. She's a phenomenal 
athlete who has the ability to play through the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Enquist will miss Karen -- and her family. "They are a special group of 
people," she says. "Janette even was a volunteer at the concession stand." 
</P>
<P>
Walker will resume her softball career this summer with the Brakettes, and 
she's hoping to make the U. S. team for the Pan-American Games. But she knows 
that someday she won't be able to take the game as seriously. "They say women 
reach their peak at 25 or 26 in fast-pitch," Walker says, "although there are 
three of our women on the Brakettes who are 30." 
</P>
<P>
Walker probably will become a physical therapist, but there is also a chance 
that she will coach. "When I go to graduate school," she says, "I'll be a 
graduate assistant with a softball team to see if I want to go into coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Either way, she'll stay active. "I have to be athletic," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Which means there yet may be life left in the old batting cage. 
</P>

CLU WOMEN START OFF ON RIGHT FOOT IN SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Answer: The only squad in Cal Lutheran history to never lose a game. 
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the women's soccer team? 
</P>
<P>
That is also what many Cal Lutheran fans were asking before the women's soccer 
team beat Claremont-Mudd, 2-1, Thursday in its initial game. The women will put 
their perfect record on the line today at La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we've made history," said freshman Vanessa Martin, who scored both 
goals against Claremont-Mudd. "I feel proud. I feel proud of everybody. We 
didn't really expect to play as well as we did. We proved a lot to a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Playing at home in front of a large crowd, Cal Lutheran took a 2-1 lead midway 
through the second half and held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We just stuck to simple, basic tactics," sophomore goalkeeper Kara Lamb said. 
"I think there's a lot of interest here because it's a novelty sport." 
</P>
<P>
Men in uniform: Reggie Williams and Bill McDonald have returned to the Cal 
State Northridge football team after temporarily leaving last week because of 
undisclosed "personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a three-year starter at cornerback, will play in tonight's game 
against Sonoma State. McDonald, a starter at safety last season, will suit up 
but won't play until next week. 
</P>
<P>
Set back: Carlos Adley, a former starter at nose tackle for Cal State 
Fullerton, has failed in his attempt to join the Northridge football team. 
Adley earned his Associate of Arts degree by receiving passing grades in three 
summer school classes, but one of his grades was not high enough to push his 
overall grade-point average over the NCAA's minimum requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Adley will attend classes on a part-time basis this year and plans to play for 
the Matadors next season. 
</P>
<P>
Running on empty: The Occidental soccer team gave an almost flawless defensive 
effort during the Azusa Pacific tournament last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers held Azusa Pacific and Loyola Marymount to one goal each. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the freshmen and transfers we have, I was not unhappy that we held 
those teams to one goal each," Occidental Coach Lowell Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Now if the Tigers can score a few -- they lost both games, 1-0 -- they should 
do all right when they open conference play Monday against La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Independent days: Northridge coaches can only speculate about the conferences 
their teams might eventually compete in after moving to Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Ker, however, does not foresee an announcement forthcoming any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"My own mentality says, 'Be ready to play as an independent,' " Ker said. "I'm 
starting my scheduling for next year with that in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage is I can pick and choose more in scheduling -- and I think 
everyone will be chomping at the bit to schedule us early because everyone 
thinks they can get the new kid on the block. 
</P>
<P>
"The disadvantage is you have to make commitments for all of your matches, 
whereas a conference provides you with those. Getting matches late in the 
season can be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
In the tank: The Occidental men's water polo team will open its season today 
against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with seven freshmen on the 14-player roster. 
</P>
<P>
Senior John Reinecke, a second-team All-Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference selection last season, and junior Scott Holdsworth are the 
team's top returning players. Reinecke and Holdsworth are both All-American 
swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're inexperienced," said Tom Schmidt, who is in his fifth year as coach of 
the Tigers, "but we're playing a schedule that should make us competitive in 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental was 15-9 overall, 7-3 in conference play last season. 
</P>
<P>
In memory: Cal Lutheran football players will wear a black number 84 on their 
helmets to commemorate teammate Carlton Hines, who died in an auto accident 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Hines, a wide receiver, wore number 84 and would have been a senior. He 
transferred to Cal Lutheran from Moorpark College and attended Kennedy High. 
</P>

CROSS-COUNTRY TEAMS AT CSUN WILL RUN DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge cross-country Coach Don Strametz describes this year's 
Matador squad -- both men's and women's teams -- as his deepest in several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect either team to be at its best when the season opens with the 
Fresno Invitational at Woodward Park this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Strametz said that because he worked his team hard throughout the week, his 
expectations would not be high. "I usually don't run them too hard on a 
Thursday before a meet," Strametz said, "but I did today." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will send an 11-man and eight-woman contingent to Fresno as Strametz 
attempts to pick the seven runners from each squad who will run in next week's 
Aztec Invitational in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on workouts, there are seven or eight guys who could be our top man 
right now," Strametz said. "It seems like every day in workouts, somebody 
different stands out." 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Jorge Castro, an NCAA Division II All-American in 1987, and Derik Vett 
are the veterans on a young team that has no seniors competing for the top 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Sasha Vujic, the school freshman record-holder in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters, 
and Jeff Gilkey are the leading sophomores, and Erick McBride and Jorge 
Rodriguez are highly regarded freshmen. Gerardo Vaca, a redshirt freshman, has 
shown promise. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Arreola is Northridge's top women's runner, but the NCAA Division II 
All-American will not race until the Riverside Invitational in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomores Kelly Tremmell and Megan Warner and freshman Laura Doering are 
expected to compete for the Lady Matadors' top position in Arreola's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Gena Jauregui, who placed sixth in the Division II 1,500 meter 
championships last spring, has been ill much of the week and is questionable 
for today's meet. 
</P>
<P>
The men's 10,000-meter race will start at 9 a.m. and the women's 5,000 will 
begin at 10.

THE MANY VIEWS OF 'DAYS OF RAGE'

<P>
On every other issue of concern to Americans, no matter how controversial, both 
sides have been publicly presented: pro-life vs. pro-choice; hawks vs. doves 
over Vietnam; pro-glasnost vs. anti-communists, to name but a few. Why must the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict be the exception? Those who have protested against 
"Days of Rage" on the ground of bias should consider that sometimes the facts 
are biased.

ABC'S LATINO STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "ABC Ad Strategy Takes Aim at Latino Viewers" (Sept. 8): 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Claudia Puig quotes ABC Entertainment executive Mark Zakarin as saying 
that his father "would read a Jewish intellectual journal and point out the ads 
for Ford Motor Co. 'It was like Ford cared about Jews in American. . . . So he 
actually bought a Ford.' " 
</P>
<P>
There was a sad irony in Zakarin's remarks. Automotive pioneer Henry Ford was 
one of the most virulent anti-Semites this country has ever produced. Ford's 
irrational hatred and suspicion of Jews was comparable to Hitler's, and he did 
what he could to attack them, using his company's resources. Perhaps his most 
hateful contribution to the annals of racism was his financing of the 
publication of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," a forgery that many 
people still wrongly believe to be an actual account of a Jewish conspiracy to 
control international finance and the media. This particular bit of libel is 
still fueling racism and anti-Semitism around the world. An edition was 
recently issued in Japan, once again purporting to be an authentic document.

PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thymus vulgaris 
</P>
<P>
Common thyme 
</P>
<P>
Perennial herb with small, aromatic leaves 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the attention lavished on basil in recent years, thyme is still one 
of the most popular kitchen herbs, essential in French cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
An herb publication once advised: "When in doubt, use thyme." It enhances 
without overwhelming, the leaves are so small they don't need to be chopped, 
and, most important, dried thyme leaves are as pungent as the fresh ones. Dried 
basil is pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Thyme is also a terrific plant for Southern California; it prefers lots of sun; 
poor, sandy soil and little irrigation, except for desert areas (thyme should 
be watered at ground level; wet leaves lose their fragrance). In most parts of 
Los Angeles, thyme is a constant, never dying. Like another Mediterranean herb, 
rosemary, thyme is virtually carefree. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike rosemary, thyme isn't much of a landscape plant. It stays low, about 12 
inches, and spreads about 18 to 24 inches. Because of this compact size, thyme 
is comfortable in containers. 
</P>
<P>
In summer, tiny lilac-colored flowers almost cover the plants; for drying, cut 
the stems just before or during flowering. Hang the stems upside down in the 
shade, and when they are completely dried, strip off the leaves and flowers and 
keep in an airtight container. The leaves are so tiny and so far apart on the 
stems that they will probably yield a smaller batch than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Although thyme is best known as a culinary herb, it has other uses. The 
Egyptians used it for embalming -- and it's still an ingredient in that 
process; the Scots drank thyme tea to prevent nightmares; to the ancient 
Romans, thyme meant courage, and soldiers bathed in thyme water to strengthen 
themselves before battle. 
</P>
<P>
Common thyme can be propagated from stem cuttings, best done in spring, and it 
grows easily from seed, but many of the unusual thymes (caraway, coconut, 
lemon, among others) can't be grown from seed. Thymus vulgaris seeds are tiny, 
so they should be covered with only the barest amount of planting medium and 
kept moist (but not wet) until they're large enough to plant into the garden. 
If thyme seeds are not carried by a local nursery, any seed catalogue with an 
herb section will have them. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, almost any nursery with an herb section will carry thyme plants. 
Finding (and growing) this plant is no challenge -- but it is deliciously 
rewarding nonetheless. JUDITH SIMS

'ROBES OF CHINA' TO BE DISPLAYED IN RARE EXHIBITION AT MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rare display of "Robes of China" from the permanent collection of the 
Edward-Dean Museum will be on view at the museum from Sunday through Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th-Century court garments -- including robes, skirts and jackets 
embroidered in multicolored silk floss and gold-wrapped strands -- afford a 
glimpse into the spectacular world of pre-revolutionary China. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the fragility of the garments and materials, and the museum's 
responsibility for preservation, exhibition of the garments is uncommon. 
(Another rare showing will be Feb. 16-March 23 at California State University, 
San Bernardino.) 
</P>
<P>
The Edward-Dean Museum is at 9401 Oak Glen Road, Cherry Valley, on the grounds 
of the Riverside County Art and Cultural Center, and is open from 1 to 4:30 
p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m.-4:30 Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $1; children under 12 free.

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Rancho Days, Sunday at the Andres Pico Adobe in Mission Hills, families can 
dine on cactus stew, make candles and enjoy a day of Early California-themed 
activities. Sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Historical Society and held 
intermittently since 1970, the fiesta is a laid-back look at rancho life. Parts 
of the adobe itself date back to 1834. Many of the docents will be in period 
costumes to help visitors feel as if they are stepping back in time. 
</P>
<P>
The fiesta begins at 9 a.m. with a ranch-style breakfast. Afterward, visitors 
can watch a local Scout troop make adobe bricks or join in the candle making, 
coffee grinding and butter churning. To get a real feeling for life before 
appliances, youngsters can help wash laundry on the adobe's patio, using a 
scrub board and soap. 
</P>
<P>
The cactus-stew lunch will be served beginning at noon. Cold drinks and pan 
dulce will also be available. A children's folkloric group will perform at 10 
a.m. and a flamenco performance is scheduled for 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
There also will be children's games, a marketplace, quilt show, bake sale. The 
house will be open for tours. Pioneer families and longtime Valley residents 
are urged to sign the Pioneer Registry. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is free. The adobe is at 10940 Sepulveda Blvd. Hours are 9 a.m. to 4 
p.m. Information: (818) 365-7810.

DAY HIKE: A VISIT TO BALBOA: VIEWS FROM PRISTINE TO TRENDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Miles of sandy beach, one of California's largest pleasure-craft harbors and 
some colorful coastal history are some of the attractions of a walk along 
Balboa Beach. Balboa -- the town, beach and island -- was long ago (1906) 
incorporated into the city of Newport Beach, but has managed to hold on to a 
different look, feel, vibe than chichi Newport. 
</P>
<P>
Local boosters and real estate promoters built the Balboa Pier and Balboa 
Pavilion in 1905 with hopes of luring tourists and well-heeled settlers. They 
succeeded on both counts. Today, Balboa's sand strand hosts huge crowds of 
surfers and sun worshipers, and as one harbor cruise company boasts: "You'll 
see some of the most expensive coastal real estate in the world." 
</P>
<P>
On the Balboa walk, you'll also encounter two historic piers and a chance to 
take the ferry to Balboa Island. 
</P>
<P>
For those weekend warriors who scoff at the mere 3-mile round-trip distance 
between Newport and Balboa piers, I recommend starting your beach walk at 
popular Huntington State Beach, 3 miles north. 
</P>
<P>
If you trek this longer option, you'll begin your 10-mile walk by heading 
down-coast on Huntington Beach, once called Shell Beach because millions of 
small bean clams were washed up on its sands. In recent years, Pismo clamming 
has undergone something of a revival here. 
</P>
<P>
At the south end of the beach you'll cross the Santa Ana River on the Coast 
Highway bridge. Formerly, the river emptied into the ocean at Newport Bay, but 
was diverted to shore at this point to reduce silting after the bay became a 
great yacht harbor. Next you'll head shoreward over some sand dunes on the east 
side of the river, then walk down-coast on Santa Ana River County Beach to 
Newport Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: Head southwest on California 55 toward Newport 
Beach. In Costa Mesa, the highway empties out onto Newport Boulevard, which 
you'll follow to its end at the beach. Just as Newport Boulevard angles sharply 
southeast and puts you on Balboa Boulevard, you'll spot the Newport Pier and a 
number of parking lots. Parking in these parts is mostly metered. Beware that 
some of the meters give you only an hour; you'll need more time to enjoy this 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Begin at the historic Newport Pier, one of the oldest in Southern 
California. A wharf built here in 1888 served as a railway shipping point for 
Orange County produce. The railroad also carried passengers here from Santa Ana 
and helped foster the development of the city of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a century ago, the Newport Dory fishing fleet began working the waters 
of Balboa Peninsula. The fishermen are still at it, still headquartered at the 
foot of Newport Pier. Each dawn, the fleet heads out to sea and returns to the 
pier in mid-morning to sell its catch of rock fish and sea bass, crab and 
lobster. 
</P>
<P>
Walk down-coast along the beach. The beach, particularly the stretch north of 
the pier, looks quintessentially post-card perfect, but has occasionally 
suffered from erosion and lack of sand. Orange County's inland building booms 
diverted many streams from their normal paths to the sea; the streams were 
unable to perform their natural function of carrying a cargo of sand to the 
Pacific. More sand is lost to the Newport Submarine Canyon, located just 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
A mile and a half of beach-walking brings you to the Balboa Pier, where a 
plaque commemorates the site of the first water-to-water flight in 1912. Glenn 
L. Martin flew a hydroplane from the waters here to Avalon Bay at Catalina 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Near the pier is Peninsula Park with picnic tables. The sidewalks are a popular 
slalom course for young skaters equipped with high-tech roller blades. 
</P>
<P>
Walking into town on Main Street, you'll cross East Balboa Boulevard and come 
to the marina. Harbor tour companies are based here. You can join a short 
cruise of Newport Harbor or do it yourself by renting a pedal-boat or kayak. 
</P>
<P>
Walk along the historic Balboa boardwalk. Remodeling and new construction have 
obliterated most of the early building prompted by the extension of electric 
railway service from Los Angeles in 1905. Still standing is that landmark of 
Victorian architecture, the Balboa Pavilion. The pavilion has served as a 
Pacific Electric Railway Terminal, a seaside recreation center and a 1940s 
dance hall. Next to the pavilion is the Fun Zone, a small collection of rides 
and arcades. 
</P>
<P>
From the foot of Palm Street, right along the boardwalk, you can catch the 
Balboa Ferry, which runs frequently and is a bargain at 20 cents for adults, 10 
cents for kids. Ferry service was inaugurated in 1907 by a genial boatman named 
John Watts, who encouraged his open launch, the Teal, with great draughts from 
an oil can. Today's small auto ferries make the 200-yard or so voyage in fewer 
than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
On Balboa Island, you can follow a scenic boardwalk to boat slips and small 
sandy beaches. Balboa Island had its beginning in 1906 when W. S. Collins 
dredged bay mud onto a sand flat that appeared in Newport Bay during low tide. 
He subdivided the island and by 1914, more than one-half the 1,300 lots were 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
After you've enjoyed the island, take the ferry back to the peninsula and 
return the same way.

With a stern warning to drinkers to stay off the road, Gov. George Deukmejian 
signed legislation Friday to toughen California's drunk driving standard -- 
dropping the legal blood alcohol level from .10% to .08% beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill by Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), a few quickly downed drinks 
can mean arrest and possibly jail time for those who get behind the wheel 
despite the new law. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, Deukmejian said, represents "a strong message to (drinking 
drivers) that we are all trying to prevent further injuries and deaths. And 
they can prevent getting arrested, getting handcuffed, getting fingerprinted, 
getting taken to jail and spending time there and paying very, very strong 
fines" only if they don't drink and drive. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he will also consider signing another drunk driving bill -- one 
that would impose an even tighter standard for truck drivers by making a blood 
alcohol level of .04 the legal limit for those who drive for a living. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial driving bill, by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), won final 
approval in the Senate on Thursday. The tough measure, which would go into 
effect Jan. 1, 1992, would also apply to those who operate ships and boats for 
commercial purposes in California waters. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, commercial drivers who are caught with any amount of 
alcohol at all in their system would be kept off the job for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Seymour bill would bring California into line with new federal standards 
for commercial drivers. Failure to have those standards in place by 1994 would 
cost the state an estimated $43 million in lost federal highway funds the first 
year and $86 million each year thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian noted that increased penalties and tougher enforcement of drunk 
driving statutes have already had an effect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes Reduction 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a reduction in the number of traffic fatalities caused by drunk 
drivers," the governor said. "On the other hand we still have a far greater 
number of such fatalities than we should have in California. Despite all of the 
efforts there are some 2,239 Californians and more than 23,000 Americans who 
died last year in accidents involving drunk drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he has not decided whether he agrees with efforts in Congress 
to tighten drunk driving standards even more -- to a blood alcohol level of 
.05%. 
</P>
<P>
"Studies indicate that when somebody's blood alcohol content level is .05% or 
higher for most individuals their driving is impaired," Deukmejian said. "I 
think there's no question when it's .08% that it is definitely impaired." 
</P>
<P>
About 350,000 Californians a year are cited for drunk driving, said California 
Highway Patrol Commissioner Maury Hannigan. Drunk drivers are involved in half 
of all fatal accidents, according to highway patrol statistics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DRUNK DRIVING LAW 
</P>
<P>
 This chart shows the percentage of alcohol in the blood, for various weight 
levels, after one hour from the time the first drink was consumed. One drink is 
defined as a 12 oz. beer, a 4 oz. class of wine or a 1 1/4 oz. shot of 80 proof 
liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law that takes effect Jan. 1, a driver with .08% or higher is 
presumed to be drunk; however, those with lower levels could also be cited for 
drunk driving.

PHILIPPINE GUN SMUGGLING: THE U.S. CONNECTION 
</P>

<P>
When Philippine congressman Nicanor de Guzman flew home to Manila from Los 
Angeles last week, customs agents found some unusual souvenirs amid his shoes 
and shirts -- 314 assorted handguns plus spare parts and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Mark another case in the California connection, an arms smuggling pipeline in 
which commercial airlines are increasingly used to smuggle illegal weapons -- 
from snub-nosed revolvers to automatic weapons -- into the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
In the last six weeks alone, police have used a newly installed X-ray scanner 
at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Air port to intercept 418 guns arriving 
on a dozen Philippine Airlines flights arriving from Los Angeles and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
That figure contrasts with 144 guns confiscated at the airport all last year 
and 70 the year before, customs figures show. Officials believe far more guns 
arrived undetected. 
</P>
<P>
"How these guns passed through Los Angeles security, and why almost every day 
we get people carrying guns from Los Angeles, I don't know," complained Zafiro 
L. Respicio, chief of airport customs here. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received reports of a rampant influx of illegal weapons coming into the 
country from the West Coast," said air force Col. Claudio T. Cruz, head of 
airport security. 
</P>
<P>
According to Federal Aviation Administration officials in Los Angeles, 
screening passengers and baggage for contraband weaponry at U.S. airports is 
the responsibility of the individual carriers, whether foreign or domestic. In 
most cases, this screening is done by private security agencies under contract 
to the carriers. 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco, for example, Philippine Airlines and most other carriers rely 
on metal detectors and/or cursory "pat-down" searches to check passengers. 
Baggage is X-rayed at random. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines spokesman Enrique B. Santos said in Manila that half the 
bags on Philippine Airlines' five weekly flights from San Francisco are checked 
by X-ray. Six of the 10 flights from Honolulu also are checked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All U.S. Flights Checked 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials here now use the X-ray scanner for all flights from the 
United States. Several weapons were detected on Northwest Airlines and 
Continental flights in June and July, records show. Another 22 guns were found 
in a ship's cargo arriving from Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said most of the smuggled weapons are meant for private use or sold 
on the black market for up to four times U.S. prices. "It's a very lucrative 
business," said Customs Commissioner Salvador M. Mison. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very possible our own people (in customs) are involved," Mison added. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said larger shipments may go to private armies that rule 
rural areas here, or are destined for transshipment to organized crime groups 
in Taiwan or Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine laws require gun licenses in advance and limit each buyer to one 
handgun and one rifle. The country has a total of 453,369 licensed guns, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
But the restrictions appear more fiction than fact in a city where house guards 
openly carry sawed-off shotguns, where discos ask patrons to check their guns 
at the door and where so many guns are fired on New Year's Eve that revelers 
are routinely killed or wounded by stray bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the gun culture is so strong that 64 members of Congress tried to 
import 150 sophisticated Galil assault rifles and Uzi submachine guns from 
Israel last spring, ostensibly for their own use. The military later 
confiscated the guns as illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the guns are smuggled in balikbayan boxes, cartons Filipinos use when 
they return from abroad. Of the 18 people arrested at the airport this year, 
only one is an American. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 21, customs police arrested Dominique C. Adams, 22, of Orem, Utah, 
after the X-ray scanner detected blurry images inside six boxes of truck parts 
she took on a Philippine Airlines flight from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting open the parts containers, police found 70 .38-caliber, .45-caliber and 
.25-caliber pistols. Adams told police she was hired to model in Manila and 
agreed to deliver the boxes for her employer but did not know their contents. 
Released on $8,200 bail, she faces up to 14 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Modesto, Calif., later arrested Adams' alleged U.S. contact, Richard 
Pedrioli, an arms dealer who was already awaiting trial on federal firearms 
smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
But the De Guzman case has dominated headlines here. The House of 
Representatives, already embarrassed by its members' own shipment of Uzis, 
voted Wednesday to suspend De Guzman for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
De Guzman, 57, a former nightclub and casino operator from central Luzon, has 
denied owning the 314 guns. But customs officials said his name was on most of 
the boxes and that $490 was paid in extra baggage charges to bring them in. The 
guns were wrapped in foil and stuffed inside eight metal U.S. mailboxes.

LEGISLATURE PASSES ETHICS MEASURE TIED TO PAY BOOST

<P>
Seeking to remove a cloud of scandal hanging over the Capitol, the Legislature 
approved a broad ethics measure Friday aimed at curbing special-interest 
influence while paving the way for a substantial legislative pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed constitutional amendment easily won approval in both houses 
despite protests from some Assembly members that it would enable legislators to 
get a salary increase without ever having to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan proposal, which will be placed before voters in June, would ban 
honorariums for elected state officials, require legislators to hold their 
meetings in public and prohibit lawmakers who leave office from lobbying the 
Legislature for a year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it would create an independent commission appointed by the 
governor that would have the sole power to set salaries for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Legislature now receive $40,816 a year plus a tax-free expense 
allowance, and some hope the commission would give them a pay hike that would 
more than offset the loss of their honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an unmistakable mood throughout our state that correctly calls for 
changes in the way public officials conduct public business," Senate President 
Pro Tem David A. Roberti, author of the measure, told his colleagues. "We are 
trying our very best, in a very definitive, positive way, to respond to the 
public's call." 
</P>
<P>
However, as the Legislature rushed to take action before its adjournment, the 
measure ran into harsh criticism in the Assembly from lawmakers who objected to 
linking the issue of ethics with a likely salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that a good ethics proposal should end up being a massive pay 
increase," said Assemblyman Phillip Wyman (R-Tehachapi) in urging his 
colleagues to vote against the constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Added Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco): "I think it's a 
mistake to link a salary increase with cleaning up our act. We should clean up 
our act first and then ask for a pay increase." 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has been under mounting pressure to enact stricter standards of 
conduct ever since the FBI raided the Capitol more than a year ago in an 
ongoing investigation of political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payments Probed 
</P>
<P>
The federal probe was launched in 1985 to uncover legislators who might have 
accepted payments -- such as honorariums -- from special-interest groups in 
exchange for favorable action on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the investigation has resulted in the indictment of Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya (D-Whittier) on charges of extortion, racketeering and 
money-laundering. At least five other elected officials continue to be subjects 
of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
In private negotiations during the last several weeks, Roberti, Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown and Republican legislative leaders rejected proposals from 
some lawmakers simply to adopt new ethics rules outright, such as a ban on 
honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they agreed to push for adoption of the proposed constitutional 
amendment that would impose tougher standards of behavior only if the voters 
approve the salary commission plan. 
</P>
<P>
Some supporters of the measure argued that legislators ought to receive higher 
pay from taxpayers so they will not be so tempted to take money from groups 
that have a stake in the fate of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"They should get more public money through the front door and less 
special-interest money through the back door," said Walter Zelman, a lobbyist 
for California Common Cause, a citizens' group that supports the ethics plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Objections 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some members of the Legislature objected to the measure because it 
would limit their ability to earn outside income, such as the lucrative 
speaking fees many of them collect. Speaker Brown, for instance, reported 
receiving $89,600 in speaking fees last year. 
</P>
<P>
But during a heated debate on the floor of the Assembly, most opposition 
focused on the question of the salary commission. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argued that the Legislature is in danger of creating the same 
controversy that beset Congress earlier this year when an appointed commission 
recommended a congressional pay hike of 50%, from $89,000 to $135,000. The 
increase was linked to legislation that would have prohibited members of 
Congress from accepting honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, members of Congress planned to accept the pay raise without a vote, 
but a public outcry ultimately forced the federal lawmakers to reject the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the congressional experience, the California constitutional amendment 
won the approval of the Senate by a vote of 33 to 7. Hours later, it passed the 
Assembly by a vote of 68 to 7. The proposed amendment goes directly to the June 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Among its provisions, the amendment would require all legislative committees to 
meet in public, except to discuss personnel, security and litigation matters. 
</P>
<P>
It also would prohibit legislators and top state officials from lobbying their 
former agencies for a year after leaving office. Current members of the 
Legislature, however, would be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the measure would require the Legislature to adopt laws limiting 
the gifts that members can receive from individuals or groups with an interest 
in legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But the constitutional amendment would do little to strengthen the enforcement 
of conflict-of-interest violations in the Legislature. While lawmakers are 
prohibited from voting on bills in which they have a financial interest, there 
is no penalty for such action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Fund Curb 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the Assembly passed another measure by Roberti that would 
limit the personal use of campaign funds by elected officials and candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Many elected officials have taken advantage of lax existing laws and used 
campaign funds to pay for such things as trips and living expenses. Roberti's 
bill would require that expenditures of campaign funds be "directly" related to 
campaign purposes. On a 70-0 vote, the Assembly sent the measure to Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the ethics proposals said they would go a long way toward imposing 
new standards of behavior and improving the image of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan will help remove the cloud that some believe surrounds the Capitol 
concerning unethical conduct," said Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) during 
debate on the constitutional amendment. "It's an unequivocal declaration that 
we do not tolerate in the Legislature that kind of conduct. We make that 
statement to the world."

SALVADOR REBEL PEACE PLAN CRAFTED TO WIN U.S. FAVOR

<P>
Although El Salvador's leftist guerrillas sat down to talk peace with the 
right-wing government of President Alfredo Cristiani this week, their words 
really were aimed at their other long-time adversary -- Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel peace proposal, which calls for sweeping political reforms in 
exchange for laying down their arms, was crafted for consumption by the Bush 
Administration: It was short on rhetoric and emphasized issues that already are 
a part of U.S. policy, such as judicial reform. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed like senators and appealing directly to the U.S. Congress, the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front commanders were the picture of 
conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"(We) aspire to a Christmas and New Year with peace in our country," commander 
Schafik Jorge Handal said Thursday. "We hope that 1990 is the year the war 
definitively ends and that our country enters a new, qualitatively better era 
of its history." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, the rebels have been pursuing a two-track policy of stepping 
up military attacks to prove their strength at home while pushing 
internationally for a negotiated settlement in the 9 1/2-year war. 
</P>
<P>
After President Bush's election last November, guerrilla commander Joaquin 
Villalobos emerged from six years in the mountains of El Salvador to say that 
he believed the new Administration would be "more pragmatic" than the 
eight-year Reagan Administration and more willing to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
In the following months, the rebels increased economic sabotage and attacks on 
military installations and began a campaign of assassinations in San Salvador. 
At the same time, they offered to stop the war and participate in presidential 
elections if the March 19 vote were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas dropped their demands for power-sharing and integration of the 
rebel and government armies -- both points the U.S. government had opposed. But 
the Bush Administration was new and slow to respond, and then-President Jose 
Napoleon Duarte rejected the offer. Cristiani went on to win by a landslide and 
took office June 1, promising to seek a solution to the war. 
</P>
<P>
While the American-educated Cristiani is well-received in Washington, the 
rebels believe that his Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena party, is 
problematic for the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, U.S. officials have accused Arena's most powerful leader, retired 
Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, of masterminding "death squad" killings and plotting 
to assassinate a U.S. ambassador. Duarte, Washington's old ally, repeatedly 
accused D'Aubuisson of having ordered the 1980 assassination of the archbishop 
of San Salvador, Msgr. Oscar A. Romero. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the hard-line Arena members, meanwhile, view U.S. involvement as a 
thorn in their side. They believe the U.S. strategy of low-intensity conflict 
has failed and that by attaching human rights to economic aid, the U.S. has in 
fact hampered their war. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas apparently see the unhappy alliance between Arena and the United 
States as providing them with a chance to pursue negotiations with a U.S. 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we think there is a crisis in Washington," said rebel spokesman 
Salvador Samayoa. "It's that we think our proposal offers Washington a low-cost 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
On a global scale, the rebels are looking at the resolution of conflicts in 
Nicaragua, Angola and Afghanistan and believe the trend could also lead to a 
reduction of U.S. involvement in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"Internationally, there is less space for war not only for us but for the 
government, too," rebel commander Handal said. "You can see this in editorials 
in U.S. newspapers that ask how long the (U.S. government) is going to finance 
this war." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels have often expressed their belief that without American 
interference, they would have won the war a long time ago, either militarily or 
politically. The rebels' peace proposals apparently are based in their 
conviction that if allowed to participate in fair and honest elections, they 
would win. 
</P>
<P>
There is no empirical evidence that they are right. Rather, there is evidence 
to the contrary: The rebels' civilian allies who returned from exile to run in 
the March presidential election won a scant 4% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exhausted From War 
</P>
<P>
The rebels acknowledge that the country is exhausted from a war that has taken 
tens of thousands of lives. And while they clearly have not abandoned their 
vision of a socialist-style revolutionary state, their proposals indicate they 
believe the battles for that goal are increasingly political. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the (rebels) have made proposals that were obviously meant to be 
rejected and they were," said Sigfrido Munes Cruz, El Salvador's ambassador to 
Mexico. "This one is different. There is a new, more realistic attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The rebel proposal calls for negotiating a cease-fire by Nov. 15 and a 
permanent demobilization of the rebel army by next February. In exchange, they 
are demanding a new attorney general, Supreme Court and National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would leave the Cristiani government intact, but it calls for reforms 
to the constitution and electoral laws and for advancing the 1991 municipal and 
legislative elections. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the disarmament is the demand for a restructuring of the armed 
forces, including a dramatic reduction in the size of the 56,000-member 
military. They want the security forces consolidated into one police force 
under civilian control and security guarantees for the return of rebel 
combatants to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
At the three-day meeting, the government agreed to set up a permanent, monthly 
dialogue with the guerrillas to begin Oct. 15 in San Jose, Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
The government team, led by Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, refused to 
comment on the rebel proposal, saying officials want to evaluate it thoroughly 
first. Cristiani also has yet to respond. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most important pronouncement will come from Washington, which 
has spent more than $3 billion over the last decade to prevent a guerrilla 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has not officially responded to the proposal, although 
the initial reaction has been as negative as that of the Salvadoran military. 
"It strikes me as not very impressive," said a senior State Department 
official. "They're supposed to be negotiating without preconditions, but when 
you boil it down, they want the entire government and constitution to be 
scrapped."

E. GERMANS WHO REMAIN OPT FOR SECURITY 
</P>

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While worldwide attention has been riveted this week on the thousands of plucky 
East Germans who have fled their country for new, uncertain lives in West 
Germany, nearly 17 million East Germans have stayed behind, resisting the lures 
of a flashy, catch-as-catch-can Western society for the often stultifying 
security of the German socialist state. 
</P>
<P>
And as the numbers of East Germans taking advantage of Hungary's open border to 
the West appear to be dwindling, the question has been raised by some in the 
West as to why more have not fled the gray, prison-like regime of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Hungary with my wife on vacation a few weeks ago," one East Berlin 
construction supervisor, a Prussian who gave his name as only Karsten, recalled 
this week while waiting for overdue building materials to be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
"But we didn't give it (emigrating) much thought. I think that is a decision 
for the younger people. I don't think we resent their going -- everyone in East 
Germany has a friend or relative that has at some time gone to West Germany. 
But this flight through Hungary might make it harder on the rest of us to 
travel on vacation to that country." 
</P>
<P>
He added that, "When you have personal contact with some of the people who 
left, it makes their decision more understandable." 
</P>
<P>
Karsten, who is middle-aged, is involved in a project in the Prenzlauerberg 
neighborhood of East Berlin, a district of four- and five-story gray-and-brown 
stucco apartment buildings constructed in the early years of this century. 
</P>
<P>
On sunny days, the neighborhood seems to gleam in the northern light -- but on 
overcast days such as this one, the mood is decidedly glum. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 40 years, the buildings here bore the pockmarks of Soviet shelling 
and Allied bombing. But now, the Communist regime has decided to give priority 
to new apartments and refurbishing many of the older buildings -- often at a 
snail-like pace. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to get to work," said Karsten, pointing at the erected 
scaffolding with idle workers. "But the cement we need hasn't arrived, so we 
can't really get started." 
</P>
<P>
He stuffed some construction plans under his jacketed arm and said of his 
fellow citizens: 
</P>
<P>
"We are all frustrated here at times. We can't travel freely, and we can't do 
as we please. But people my age have built up a pretty good life. We work to 
get a job, housing, maybe a car. I just hope things get better." 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on job security was echoed by his deputy, a 25-year-old Saxon 
named Heinrich. 
</P>
<P>
"What did the refugees in Passau (West Germany) tell you?" he asked a Western 
visitor. "They say they are going to get all sorts of jobs -- but how about the 
high unemployment rate in West Germany? We don't have any unemployment here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Unemployment 
</P>
<P>
Most observers in East Germany say there is very little unemployment -- 
although many people are working at jobs that they don't like but must keep. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, we have good jobs," said Heinrich. "But there's a shortage of building 
materials, which slows us down. But if you look around the city and figure out 
something, you can usually find a way to get around the shortages." 
</P>
<P>
A third member of the group walked up, a towheaded young man wearing a jacket, 
blue jeans and sneakers, and he observed, "If you have a place to live, a job, 
a TV set and you can get butter, eggs and milk at a low price, then it's good 
to live in a country where you don't have to worry about food, housing and 
education." 
</P>
<P>
West German television makes directly available to East Germans scenes of the 
affluent capitalistic society -- but also scenes of drugs, unemployment and 
financial competition. 
</P>
<P>
Many East Germans, observers here say, are obviously opting for a society based 
on security. 
</P>
<P>
As one Western analyst based in East Germany said: "Why haven't more people 
fled? Well, it's a German trait to opt for security -- to prefer a no-risk 
society for a more adventurous one." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a young waitress said she holds nothing -- neither envy nor anger -- 
against those who had left for West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, she said she decided to get married, partly because couples have an 
easier time finding suitable apartments than do single people. 
</P>
<P>
The construction supervisors and others suggest that the young people who are 
leaving East Germany for the West are doing so to shape a better personal 
economic future, rather than escape political repression by the regime of 
Communist leader Erich Honecker. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to understand that those leaving through Hungary are 
not political refugees," said Hans-Klaus, a professional man in his mid-30s. 
"They may not like the system, but they left for economic reasons -- to make a 
better life -- and not because of political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Klaus also said he does not believe that the departure of these East 
Germans will act as a safety valve by siphoning off the dissidents in East 
German society. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were basically nonpolitical," he observed. "The people who are 
the real dissidents want to stay in East Germany and oppose the regime -- but 
they are often given a ticket directly to West Germany."

'BLOCH WATCH' BY MEDIA, FBI HAS A SURREAL AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. diplomat Felix S. Bloch, branded a suspected spy for the Soviet Union, 
slowly turns the pages of an Austrian novel as he sits quietly for three hours 
on a long park bench on a warm but breezy Washington afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of journalists sit on the same bench. A television cameraman and sound 
technician stretch and nap on the bench as well. A half-dozen FBI agents, 
dressed like college students on a frolic, chat and joke on the other side of 
the narrow street but keep their eyes on him. A young and curious boy snaps his 
picture for a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
What is churning through the mind of the 54-year-old, Vienna-born Bloch? Does 
he curse his tormentors? Does he bemoan his fate? Or does he simply absorb 
himself in his book, a novel by Joseph Roth, an Austrian who committed suicide 
in Paris a half-century ago? No outsider probably will ever know. 
</P>
<P>
A disturbing, surreal air cloaks daily scenes such as this. The violation of a 
man's privacy is obvious. The FBI pleads the security of the nation as its 
excuse. Newspapers and television plead the significance of the story as 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The victim himself does not try to avoid the distasteful surveillance. In a 
sense, he may be courting it. He could, after all, read inside his apartment. 
But he seems, in his taciturn, stoic manner, to want the world to know about 
the violation of his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
An American has to hunt in fiction for a punishment to rival Bloch's. Perhaps 
the tale of "The Man Without a Country" comes closest. In the sentimental 
Edward Everett Hale story, which Bloch might have read as a boy in New York, 
the anti-hero Philip Nolan is convicted by a naval court-martial of treason and 
condemned to spend the rest of his life on ships in foreign waters without ever 
hearing the name of the United States again. 
</P>
<P>
But there is one great difference between Bloch and the fictional Nolan: Bloch 
has not been convicted of anything. 
</P>
<P>
The case began earlier this year when French agents reportedly videotaped 
Bloch, director of the State Department office that deals with the European 
Community, as he handed a small travel bag to a Soviet intelligence agent at 
the Hotel Meurice Ciga in Paris. After receiving a report from the French, the 
FBI quickly assigned its own agents to watch Bloch in Washington, hoping to 
catch him in some act of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
But before they could catch him at anything, Bloch, according to American 
officials, received a wiretapped call from a Soviet KGB agent who warned him: 
"A bad virus is going around, and we believe you are infected." That signaled 
Bloch that the FBI was on his tail. 
</P>
<P>
With the call, the FBI had no reason to hide anymore. On June 22, FBI agents 
confronted Bloch with their evidence but failed to inveigle a confession out of 
him. Bloch reportedly insisted that he knew the Soviet agent only as a fellow 
stamp collector and denied any espionage. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, though it continued to pay his salary of almost $80,000 a 
year, then suspended Bloch from his job, lifted his security clearance and 
wrenched his nameplate off the door of his office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, news of the suspicions about Bloch was leaked to ABC-TV and then 
confirmed by the State Department. A department spokesman announced officially 
that Bloch was under investigation by the FBI for "illegal activities" 
involving "agents of a foreign government." He is the highest-ranking State 
Department official ever accused of what sounded like espionage. 
</P>
<P>
The public pronouncements ushered in the epoch of surrealism. Throughout the 
nation and the world, Bloch was branded as a suspected spy. Whenever he left 
the confines of the bugged and wiretapped apartment where he and his wife live, 
he set off a bizarre, carnival-like parade of FBI agents and cameramen and 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI obviously relished the carnival atmosphere of the surveillance. On top 
of this, officials obviously hoped that Bloch eventually would break under the 
pressure of so much public glare and confess his sins. 
</P>
<P>
But, so far, Bloch seems to have outwaited most of the press and outwitted the 
FBI. The FBI, in private, insists that it does not believe Bloch's stamp 
collecting alibi. But it is still checking it out. 
</P>
<P>
A kind of ritual orders the watch around Bloch's apartment building in the 
fashionable Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, with its embassies and 
diplomatic residences. More than a dozen FBI agents park outside in aging, 
nondescript American cars day and night. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," said one neighbor recently. "I feel as safe as President Bush." 
</P>
<P>
This surveillance probably will go on until the FBI somehow gathers enough 
evidence for a case against Bloch, if the evidence exists; or until his lawyers 
reach some kind of agreement with the government for Bloch's immunity from 
prosecution in exchange for information from him, assuming he has that 
information. In theory, the present scene could persist for years. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the surveillance, a cluster of jostling reporters and 
television cameramen followed Bloch wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
The press, wearying of the Bloch story, has covered his movements only 
intermittently in the last few weeks. On some days, he actually has walked down 
the street without a cameraman following him. The television networks, however, 
still keep messengers on duty to alert them if anything dramatic comes up. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, leading his white Scottish terrier Mephisto on a leash, stepped out of 
the front door at 2:30 on a recent afternoon. It was the first time he had 
emerged that day. 
</P>
<P>
Since Bloch was not wearing walking shoes, his followers knew that no marathon 
awaited them that day. Wearing a blue checked shirt, gray slacks and brown 
loafers, he made his way to a nub of a park on Connecticut Avenue. The little 
park, which stands opposite the Chinese Embassy, harbors a white Goddess of 
Liberty put up by protesters against Chinese oppression of students in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch read from the paperback Roth novel, occasionally consulting a large 
German dictionary by his side. Sometimes he cupped his chin like Auguste 
Rodin's sculpture of "The Thinker"; sometimes he kept his legs crossed in 
almost rigid relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
Beverley Lumpkin, an ABC News reporter who has probably spoken with Bloch more 
than any other journalist on the watch, tried to start a conversation with him. 
But he was in a taciturn mood. He took off his reading glasses, blinked his 
eyes and muttered something about the Roth novel reflecting "the process of 
life." He denied he was feeling depressed but complained of a headache. 
</P>
<P>
But, to most of her questions, he merely nodded, shook his head or shrugged. At 
5:30, after three hours on the bench, he arose and walked back to his apartment 
building, the cameraman in front of him this time, the FBI agents again behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In a quarter of an hour he reached the building and, just before slipping past 
the front door, said softly to the press and anyone else who could hear: "I'll 
be back tomorrow. I don't know where. I don't know when."

BIBLE IS REAL PAGE-TURNER AT SOVIET FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MASHA HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two lines of eager Soviet citizens stretched on either side of famous American 
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair's booth at the Moscow International Book Fair, 
but no one stopped to browse through her anti-religious literature. O'Hair 
herself, in fact, was taking a snooze. 
</P>
<P>
In one queue, about 75 people waited for their turns to flip through Jewish 
religious and cultural books. In the other, about 150 people stood, hoping to 
get a free New Testament Bible. 
</P>
<P>
It was a turn of events in this officially atheistic state that did not please 
O'Hair, a flamboyant 70-year-old non-believer who took her views to the Supreme 
Court and in 1963 won a decision eliminating obligatory prayer in public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I am completely stunned to find out the U.S.S.R. is absolutely indifferent to 
atheism," she said, shaking herself awake to talk to a journalist and quickly 
warming to her subject. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to think here that if you just leave religion alone, it will go 
away. But that's ridiculous," she fumed, slapping her knee. "The Pope is never 
going to call me up and say, 'Madalyn, I give up.' No, he won't do that. You 
have to fight religion, actively show people why religion is so dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
It was a message preached with feeling, but there were few takers at the book 
fair. O'Hair's Russian-speaking translator, intended to help Soviets with 
questions, sat idly on a chair and listened while O'Hair talked. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Soviet police helped control crowds at the Jewish and Christian 
literature booths. 
</P>
<P>
The 7th Moscow International Book Fair -- which opened this week and is 
traditionally monitored by foreigners looking for Soviet trends -- was as clear 
a sign as any of the revival of religious freedom and interest in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
It is a revival tolerated and even encouraged by President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, whose mother is said to regularly attend church and who has publicly 
acknowledged that he was baptized as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost, the Russian word for Gorbachev's policy of permitting greater 
openness, was in plentiful evidence at the fair, which will close Sunday after 
a five-day run. 
</P>
<P>
Among the books on display from 65 countries was one by former Soviet Jewish 
dissident Natan Sharansky about his years in Soviet prisons, and one by 
American hard-liner Zbigniew Brzezinski called "The Great Failure -- Birth and 
Death of Communism in the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
But the religious booths drew the biggest crowds, and it was there that the 
sense of new possibilities was the greatest. 
</P>
<P>
The distribution of 10,000 free Bibles at the Moscow fair was a first. "We 
finally felt the time was right and no one would get in trouble for it," said 
Doug Ross, executive editor of the Evangelical Christian Publishers Assn., 
based in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
And even though the Assn. of Jewish Publishers, based in New York City, has had 
a booth since the first fair in 1977, "this time the crowds are larger than 
ever," said the group's president, Charles Donald Lieber. "I guess people are 
less afraid with every passing year to be seen demonstrating an interest in 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
Both Ross and Lieber said Soviet customs officials, who in the past have 
carefully inspected and often confiscated their religious literature, this time 
generally let whole cartons of books pass unexamined. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the books were not for sale to individuals but instead were intended to 
attract publishers and distributors. People still stood in long lines just for 
the chance to finger a book. 
</P>
<P>
The Bible giveaway was the fair's biggest draw. Vera Kaprolov, 69, was among 
those who stood in line for more than two hours but still missed out on a 
chance to get a free Bible. She handed in her name and address, hoping to get 
one of the 15,000 Bibles the evangelical publishers have promised to mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Jewish, but the New Testament is better than nothing," she explained. "In 
the past, I've been able to read a few fragments of the Bible, but that is 
all." 
</P>
<P>
"The Bible is the best-selling book in the world, and this line convinces us 
that if it were available here, it would be the Soviet Union's best seller," 
Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
"One man begged me for a Bible, but I didn't have any more for that day, so I 
had to say no," he said. "He looked me in the eyes and said, in English, 'Maybe 
you will remember me.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's important," Ross added. "We should all remember him. We in the 
United States, where everybody has got a Bible on the shelf, have got to 
remember that in the Soviet Union, there are many people who can't see a Bible, 
hold a Bible, read a Bible."

THAIS TO PROBE OFFICIAL'S LINKS TO U.S. DRUG RING 
</P>

<P>
The Thai government is sending a high-ranking team of officials to the United 
States to investigate American allegations that a top Thai police officer has 
links to a Los Angeles-based drug ring, it was announced here. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Vasit Dejkunchorn, deputy chief of Thailand's police, said Thursday that 
he and his investigators will spend about a month investigating charges against 
Veth Petchborom, a police major general who was indicted by a U.S. federal 
grand jury in July. 
</P>
<P>
Veth, who has been suspended from his duties without pay pending the outcome of 
the investigation, is believed to be the highest-ranking Thai official to have 
been indicted in a U.S. drug case. At the time of his suspension, he was the 
assistant police inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, issued by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., on July 13, 
alleges that Veth was the "controlling force" in the shipment of 11 pounds of 
heroin that was seized at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York in 
November, 1984, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration statement. Two 
Thai nationals, including a second lieutenant in the Thai air force, were 
arrested at the time. 
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Veth was accused of helping to arrange shipments, 
investing personally and using his influence to "facilitate the free passage of 
narcotics shipments" through Bangkok airport. The drug cartel was said to have 
arranged 15 earlier shipments. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged mastermind of the drug ring, Suvit Taechaphanarat, was arrested 
last year, pleaded guilty to three narcotics charges and was sentenced July 21 
by a federal judge in Los Angeles to 30 years in prison. A total of 22 people 
have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant for Veth was issued in Brooklyn, but Vasit said in a 
telephone interview that U.S. authorities had made no request to the Thais to 
hand him over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a judicial treaty between the two countries, it does not 
provide for the extradition of Thai nationals to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Vasit said he wants to question Suvit and others arrested in the case, saying 
more than one witness had made allegations against Veth, one of Thailand's 
highest-ranking police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The case is considered significant because Thailand has been accused in the 
past of turning a blind eye to the drug trade from the so-called Golden 
Triangle opium-producing area of Thailand, Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Laos. 
</P>
<P>
Vasit said Veth was not arrested and emphasized that no criminal charges have 
been brought against him in Thailand.

FAA ACCUSED OF ALTERING '81 CONTROLLER DATA 
</P>

<P>
A House panel charged Friday that FAA officials lied under oath about payroll 
records prepared during the 1981 controllers' strike and in some instances 
doctored time sheets to cheat the controllers. 
</P>
<P>
The committee asked the Justice Department to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with shoddy documents to justify the firings before the Merit Systems 
Protection Board, Federal Aviation Administration officials in Chicago for 
three months created attendance records to bolster their cases, lawmakers 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on 
investigations and oversight capped a three-year investigation that included 
private hearings and documents subpoenaed from the Chicago Air Route Traffic 
Control Center at Aurora, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
John Leyden, a spokesman for the FAA, refused to comment, except to say: "The 
FAA has received the report and will review it." 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee said it was not judging the merits of the 450 firings in 
Chicago, which were among 11,500 nationwide ordered on Aug. 5, 1981, by 
then-President Ronald Reagan two days after members of the Professional Air 
Traffic Controllers Organization struck. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the subcommittee said, it was concerned with the actions of FAA 
officials while they were defending the firings in front of the board that 
considers appeals from dismissed federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
For example, FAA officials corrected some attendance records to bring them up 
to date, but altered others, in some instances recording a controller who was 
on leave at the time of the strike as being absent without leave, to cheat the 
controllers, the subcommittee said.

SENATE GROUP BACKS NEW CLEAN AIR PLAN WITH TOUGHER CONTROL OF AUTO EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a new sign of congressional discontent over President Bush's clean air 
proposal, a bipartisan group of senators Friday endorsed a rival plan that 
would impose more stringent automobile pollution controls than envisioned by 
the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, backed by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), 
rejects a White House-backed approach that calls for a forced switch from 
gasoline to cleaner-burning fuels in the nation's smoggiest cities as a 
fundamental solution to the air pollution problem. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted by Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), the proposal 
instead would significantly tighten pollution controls on all automobiles, no 
matter what kind of fuel they burn. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, every new car sold in the nation would be required to meet the 
current California emissions standard by 1993 and achieve an additional 50% 
reduction in pollutants by the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal Faces Changes 
</P>
<P>
In parting company with the White House, the senators provided another 
indication that powerful forces in Congress will attempt to reshape the 
President's proposal, with some lawmakers favoring tougher provisions and 
others attempting to relax restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The looming battles seem certain to delay approval of a broad-based clean air 
plan beyond the Administration's end-of-the-year target, advocates on both 
sides of the debate say. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) agreed this week to use the 
White House proposal as a starting point but made clear that he plans to try to 
significantly tighten its motor vehicle provisions. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the issue, House Energy Committee Chairman John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), a principal sponsor of the White House bill, has signaled his intent 
to introduce an alternative plan with watered-down restrictions on coal-burning 
power plant emissions that cause acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
The strong bipartisan support expressed Friday for the tougher anti-smog 
proposal appears to give the measure a strong chance to emerge intact from the 
Senate, congressional observers said. It was endorsed by 11 of the 16 members 
of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and two senators who are 
not on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prefers Baucus Plan 
</P>
<P>
The support of Chafee, who is also a principal sponsor of the Administration 
plan, could encourage the White House to accept a more stringent approach, at 
least on the issue of smog control. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he had lent support to the Bush proposal because it was the 
"first effort an Administration had made in eight years" to tackle the nation's 
air pollution problem, Chafee said he favors the Baucus approach to reducing 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate smog-control plan, endorsed by eight Democrats and five Republicans, 
would not significantly accelerate the rate at which air quality in the 
nation's cities would be expected to reach healthful levels. 
</P>
<P>
Under both plans, most cities would be expected to attain federal health 
standards by the year 2000. Houston, New York and Chicago would be given 
another five years, and Los Angeles -- by far the nation's smoggiest city -- 
would not be required to meet the standards until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
But Baucus and other sponsors of the rival proposal argued that its stringent 
requirements would be more likely to ensure that cities actually could meet the 
ambitious deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-Time Finish Predicted 
</P>
<P>
The Administration plan "doesn't do what it purports to do," Baucus said in an 
interview. "Our bill will get us across the finish line on time." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the senators contended that the Administration unrealistically 
pinned its hopes of achieving cleaner air on shifting to alternative-fueled 
vehicles in the nation's smoggiest cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally don't understand how you're going to get X number of people in 
Los Angeles to buy alternative cars," Chafee said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they criticized a White House-backed rule that would allow 
some automobiles to violate emission requirements as long as an auto maker's 
fleet average satisfied the pollution standard. 
</P>
<P>
Some state air quality directors have contended that such an "averaging" 
provision could permit an overall increase in emissions of air pollutants, 
despite the nationwide adoption of current California tailpipe standards. 
</P>
<P>
Citing such conclusions, the senators advocated a system that would require 
every car to comply with the regulations and called for the eventual adoption 
of thresholds twice as stringent as those endorsed by the White House. Auto 
makers would be permitted to meet the standards by improving current gasoline 
engines or by introducing new vehicles capable of burning cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Although the alternative smog control plan would also address stationary 
sources of pollution, such as factories, its primary emphasis is on 
automobiles, which produce about half of the hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides 
that are the major contributors to urban smog. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old saying," Chafee said. "You rob banks because that's where the 
money is. You regulate cars because that's where the problem is."

SUBPOENA TO BE SOUGHT TO MAKE PIERCE TESTIFY 
</P>

<P>
A House subcommittee agreed Friday to seek a subpoena for the testimony of 
former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. after he 
failed to show up for a long-scheduled appearance in the congressional inquiry 
into abuses at HUD during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"While he may run, he may not hide," said Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), 
chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and 
employment, which is investigating political favoritism and mismanagement 
during Pierce's eight years as HUD chief. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who testified voluntarily on May 25, notified the subcommittee Thursday 
night that he would not appear for scheduled testimony Friday. Pierce said he 
needed more time to prepare his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lantos noted that twice before Pierce had received long postponements 
so that he could prepare for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lantos Charges Betrayal 
</P>
<P>
"I consider Mr. Pierce's decision not to appear as scheduled to be capricious, 
deceitful and a betrayal of the good faith in which this subcommittee has dealt 
with him," Lantos said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens (R-Ohio), the ranking Republican on the panel, 
joined in supporting a subpoena for Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only is 'Silent Sam' silent, apparently today he's also invisible," Lukens 
said, referring to the nickname used by some to describe Pierce during his 
tenure at HUD. 
</P>
<P>
To call attention to Pierce's failure to appear, the House panel assembled 
before a vacant witness table, complete with microphones, pitchers of ice water 
and empty chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Three other subcommittee members joined Lantos and Lukens in supporting the 
decision to subpoena Pierce for testimony at several future hearings. But, 
under House rules, the subcommittee cannot vote on the subpoena action until 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The refusal to allow me an additional two weeks' preparation time, when 
numerous other witnesses have been granted even longer postponements, simply is 
unfair," Pierce said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Decisions Targeted 
</P>
<P>
But Lantos said that the subcommittee had gone out of its way to be fair to 
Pierce, agreeing to limit the scope of his scheduled testimony to two 
controversial decisions during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
One involved HUD financing for a $15-million housing rehabilitation project in 
Durham, N.C. Although Pierce said he had no direct role in funding decisions, a 
former high HUD official has testified that Pierce ordered her to sign off on 
the Durham project, despite objections of HUD staff aides. 
</P>
<P>
The second issue involves Pierce's ruling to lift restrictions on DRG Funding 
Corp., a mortgage broker that had been placed on probation for violating HUD 
rules in the agency's coinsurance program. Since then, DRG loans totaling $538 
million have gone sour, and the company is the subject of a grand jury 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce said he needs legal counsel because the subcommittee has dropped its 
"non-adversarial manner."

SCIENCE WRITER HEPPENHEIMER TREATED FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas A. Heppenheimer, a nationally known science writer from Fountain Valley, 
was listed in fair condition Friday with three gunshot wounds, UC Irvine 
Medical Center officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley police said that Heppenheimer, 42, was reported shot at his 
home on Thursday by his longtime companion. Police said they are not 
recommending filing of charges because they believe Angela Lee Johnson, 30, 
acted in self-defense after Heppenheimer threatened her. Johnson was not hurt, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Heppenheimer, 42, suffered two bullet wounds to the head and one to the left 
shoulder, according to UCI Medical Center officials. 
</P>
<P>
Heppenheimer is the author of several science-related nonfiction books, 
including "Earthquake," and also writes frequently for science magazines and 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Detective Steve Williams said that Johnson, who has lived with 
Heppenheimer for 10 years, had fled from him during a dispute Thursday 
afternoon and locked herself in a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Heppenheimer) forced the door open, and she said she shot him because he 
was carrying a club of some sort," Williams said. The officer said police are 
not sure how many shots Johnson fired with the .25-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
"We are turning over our information to the district attorney's office, but 
we're not recommending charges against either person," Williams said. He said 
that police found no previous arrests involving Heppenheimer.

ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT LEADS TO STIFF SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge, swayed by a psychiatric report warning that Be Tu Van Tran's 
anti-Communist fanaticism might again drive him to violence, on Friday sent the 
Vietnamese immigrant to prison for seven years for a 1986 political 
assassination attempt in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Just four months ago, when the 33-year-old Tran entered what amounted to a 
guilty plea in the shooting of a former Saigon housing minister, his lawyer 
predicted that the Santa Ana man would only have to spend a few months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald, noting Tran's 
reputed lack of full remorse, told Tran bluntly in court Friday: "If you want 
the credit for the crime, you also must do the time." 
</P>
<P>
A slight and withdrawn former deliveryman, Tran become a hero among strident 
anti-Communist factions of the local Vietnamese community after he claimed 
credit for stalking, shooting and critically injuring Tran Kanh Van, who had 
been portrayed as a Communist "lackey" by militant immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In confessing to the March 18, 1986, attack, Tran told police that he was 
driven by rage to shoot Van after the Westminster businessman was quoted in a 
Los Angeles Times Magazine piece as espousing a desire for normalized relations 
between Vietnam and the United States. Tran has since given conflicting 
statements about his role. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Robert Weinberg, maintaining that Tran took responsibility for 
the shooting only as a "badge of honor" in the fight against Communism, 
continued to insist Friday that his client may be innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg added in an interview that, in light of the stern sentence, his legal 
maneuverings have clearly backfired and that he now regrets the decision to 
have Tran enter in May what is commonly known as a "slow plea." 
</P>
<P>
Under that rarely used legal arrangement, Tran gave up his right to a jury 
trial -- which had threatened to rip open emotional war wounds among the 
Vietnamese community -- and effectively pleaded guilty to the crime of 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
He had faced a maximum nine-year sentence under the arrangement, but Weinberg 
-- raising the ire of Judge Fitzgerald -- had publicly voiced confidence that 
his client would not be ordered to spend more than a few months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said he considered Tran "a danger to society, a substantial danger, 
especially to those who would ever espouse the thought of a reunified Vietnam 
under Communist control." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans argued to the judge that Tran's attack 
and the glory he took in it are a particularly heinous affront to a society 
that values free expression. "He's proud of (the shooting)," Evans said. "He's 
not remorseful." 
</P>
<P>
In delivering the sentence, Fitzgerald cited a diagnostic study by the state 
Department of Corrections that said Tran has reluctantly expressed only 
"superficial remorse." 
</P>
<P>
The mental health professionals who examined Tran described him as a possible 
manic-depressive and said that his "fanatical" commitment to anti-Communism 
suggests that "should his political cause deem it, he will re-offend regardless 
of the consequences."

PILOT DIES AS PLANE CRASHES IN YARD; 2 IN HOUSE UNHURT

A twin-engine cargo plane crashed into a residential neighborhood shortly after 
takeoff from Ontario International Airport on Friday, bursting into flames a 
few feet from a bedroom where a 9-year-old girl was getting ready for school. 
</P>
<P>
The girl and her mother fled the house unhurt, but the pilot, identified as 
24-year-old Steve Quinto of Alta Loma, was killed. The plane, a Piper Chieftain 
operated by Ameriflight Inc. of Burbank, was en route to Santa Barbara for 
United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Wilcox, air safety investigator for the National Transportation 
Safety Board, said the pilot reported to the airport control tower shortly 
after taking off at 6:50 a.m. that he had lost an engine. The tower gave the 
pilot clearance to turn around and land on the runway he had just left. 
</P>
<P>
Jeana Shadday, 15, a sophomore at Chaffey High School, said she was walking 
down Rosewood Court, northwest of the airport, on her way to school when she 
"heard a low airplane," and looked up to see the aircraft flying with its wings 
"straight up and down," perpendicular to the ground and heading toward her 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"All the way from the corner back to my house, I was screaming and yelling and 
crying for my mom and everybody to get out of the house," Jeana said. Before 
she reached her house, the plane plunged into the front yard next door, 
bursting into flames. 
</P>
<P>
The plane had clipped the top of a tree and landed in the 800 block of East 
Rosewood, just in front of a two-bedroom house occupied by Sandra Ramirez, 28, 
and her daughter, Karina. 
</P>
<P>
Karina, a third-grade student, said, "Me and my mom were inside the house. I 
was combing my hair and then I heard a big 'bam' and so I closed my ears and 
ran." 
</P>
<P>
Karina said she fell and then looked up to her bedroom window and saw a flash 
of red. "And I started screaming and crying," she said. "And my mom and me ran 
out of the house and so did my dog." 
</P>
<P>
Karina's father, Jose, was already at work when the crash occurred. Notified by 
his sister, he raced home to find his family safe, but the front of his house 
charred, along with his car parked at the curb. 
</P>

Some residents along Rosewood said they had already been jolted awake by an

altogether," he said.

Legislation that would give Los Angeles incentives to draw less water from the 
Mono Lake Basin cleared the Legislature on Friday after lawmakers were told it 
was the first step in resolving one of California's most bitter water battles. 
</P>
<P>
With the backing of an unusual coalition that included the city, 
environmentalists, several eastern Sierra counties and state water officials, 
the measure was sent to Gov. George Deukmejian for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate . . . this is a peace treaty," said Sen. 
John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) before the legislation won unanimous Senate 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the two-bill package passed the Assembly 59 to 5 and 67 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Elated lawmakers, still marveling that they had been able to reach a consensus 
on legislation that affected such an emotional issue, saw the measure as 
representing much more than a potential resolution to the dispute over Mono 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Restore Civility' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced historically if the bill does anything at all, if . . . it helps 
restore civility to the debate over water . . . that's the benefit to the state 
of California," said Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), a sponsor of the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 75 years ago that William Mulholland went up to the Owens Valley and 
said, 'Let's take the water,' and for 75 years you have had a battle in 
California," he added. "It was not just save Mono Lake or save the Owens 
Valley. It was what that represented -- the dominance of big over small, the 
dominance of cities over rural areas." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation that encompassed two bills -- one by Isenberg and one by 
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) -- establishes a $65-million 
environmental water fund and provides that money from the fund can be used to 
preserve Mono Lake by helping Los Angeles develop alternative water sources. 
</P>
<P>
Before it can apply for grants from the fund, the bill requires the city to 
reach an agreement with one of its oldest adversaries, the Mono Lake Committee. 
The committee and other environmental groups have challenged the city in 
several court actions, complaining that its diversion of water from streams 
that feed the lake has lowered lake levels and endangered the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the support for the Isenberg-Baker legislation came from lawmakers who 
said they feared the courts would eventually force Los Angeles to reduce its 
diversions from the Mono Lake Basin anyway. The city's only alternative then, 
they said, would be to draw more from the Metropolitan Water District, which is 
served by the State Water Project. 
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell in this legislation we help Los Angeles, we help Mono Lake . . . 
and we reduce the threat on the yield of the state water (project)," said Sen. 
Ruben S. Ayala, (D-Chino). 
</P>
<P>
The only opposition to the bills in the Senate came from Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who saw them as an attempt by agricultural and other 
interests in Northern California to keep more water for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point senators from Los Angeles, if we ever decided to get together on 
an issue like water, . . . could run the state," said Rosenthal, who abstained 
from voting on the measures.

BILLS PUSHED TO LET GOVERNOR NAME AIDES TO 3 TOP JOBS

Legislation that would allow Gov. George Deukmejian to appoint top aides to 
three high-paying patronage jobs near the end of his term without Senate 
confirmation appeared headed for final approval in the closing hours of the 
1989 legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Legislature approved a bill that would allow 
lawyer-legislators who put their Bar Assn. membership on inactive status to 
qualify for judicial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs in question -- judgeships and positions on full-time state boards -- 
are regarded as political plums, and the appointments are jealously guarded 
prerogatives of gubernatorial power. 
</P>
<P>
Changing the rules for the appointments was part of the last-minute 
horse-trading as the Legislature moved toward its Friday recess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Golden Parachutes' 
</P>
<P>
Some Democratic lawmakers complained bitterly that the Republican governor 
would be able to appoint three members of his personal staff to $85,000-a-year 
jobs without Senate confirmation. The positions were variously described as 
"golden parachutes" or "soft-landing pads" for Deukmejian staffers who will 
likely lose their jobs when a new governor takes office in January of 1991. 
(Deukmejian announced earlier this year that he would not run for a third 
term.) 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian Administration officials deny that the governor will use his 
appointment powers to provide jobs for particular members of his personal 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor has not even focused on those appointments," Deukmejian Press 
Secretary Kevin Brett said. "It would be premature to even speculate about who 
would fill them." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian himself had no comment on rumors that he had specific staff members 
in mind for the posts. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Democratic legislative leaders deny that the bill that clarifies a 
state constitutional restriction on judicial appointments was intended to aid 
any specific legislators who would like to be appointed as judges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Powers 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Deukmejian appointments that are outside the review of the Senate 
would be to a new, full-time solid waste management board with broad powers 
over local governments' trash disposal and recycling efforts. The appointments 
were negotiated by Deukmejian and legislative leaders, who would also be able 
to name members to the board. 
</P>
<P>
The third job would be a seat on the Public Employment Relations Board. 
Republican Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) amended a bill to allow Deukmejian to 
fill a position on that board without Senate confirmation. The job becomes 
vacant in November, 1990, two months before Deukmejian is due to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
Several legislative sources who asked not to be named said that Deukmejian 
officials were "unabashed" about wanting to use the appointments to reward 
Deukmejian Administration stalwarts. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) was one of several legislators who argued 
against exempting the Deukmejian appointments from Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ought to Protect It' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any good, valid reason why we in the Senate should give up this 
prerogative," Dills said. "I think we ought to protect it and guard it as long 
as we can until there is a good and sufficient reason to prove that we don't do 
our job properly." 
</P>
<P>
Davis described the exemption to Senate confirmation as a "trade-off." In 
return for a one-time exemption for the Employment Relations Board post, 
Deukmejian agreed to what Davis described as "a quid pro quo" -- allowing the 
Senate to confirm the appointment of the chief of the State Police. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also carried a bill that would allow a number of legislators to qualify 
for judgeships under a constitutional provision requiring five years' 
membership in the State Bar immediately before appointment to the Municipal 
Court bench and 10 years' membership before appointment to the Superior or 
Appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than pay annual dues of $417 a year for active Bar membership, several 
legislators have chosen to switch to inactive status, which costs them $50 a 
year, according to Senate Democratic Leader Barry Keene of Benicia. Keene said 
he was one of those who had chosen inactive status. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Requirement 
</P>
<P>
Pressed by Keene and others, Davis agreed to include language in a bill that 
states that inactive membership satisfies the constitutional requirement -- 
clearing the way for Keene and others to be named to judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he expects Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson to be the next governor 
of California, which would cut Keene and most other Democrats out of hope for a 
judicial appointment. 
</P>
<P>
As originally drafted, the provision applied only to legislators, members of 
Congress and law professors. But Davis amended it to qualify any inactive 
member of the State Bar.

SENATE OKS PLAN FOR SALES TAX INCREASE FOR NEW JAILS 
</P>

Despite warnings that it could hurt ethnic neighborhoods, the state Senate on 
Friday passed a controversial measure allowing Los Angeles and five other 
financially strapped counties to ask their voters for a half-cent sales tax 
hike to pay for new jails. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata), was approved 23 to 11 and then 
returned to the Assembly for approval of Senate amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Los Angeles, the measure affects Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino, 
Riverside and Humboldt counties. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal prompted emotional debate and parliamentary bickering reminiscent 
of the acrimonious fight two years ago to keep a planned state prison out of 
East Los Angeles. Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) claimed that without a 
special prohibition, the measure will be used by Los Angeles County officials 
to add 2,408 more prison beds in the already jail-glutted Chinese and Latino 
neighborhoods of his district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critics' Arguments 
</P>
<P>
"Where will they build these jails?" Torres asked. "Right in East LA. Right in 
downtown Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have also complained for months that the sales tax increases, which 
require only a simple majority of voters in each county to approve, are nothing 
but illegal end-runs around Proposition 13 restrictions that call for a 
two-thirds majority. A similar sales tax hike, approved by San Diego County 
voters in 1988, was held unconstitutional by a Riverside Superior Court judge 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
One of the jail tax measure's chief advocates, Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), warned Friday that the half-cent increases are desperately needed to 
maintain "law and order." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Don't Have a Place' 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue to enact laws with mandatory incarceration only to turn 
people loose because we don't have a place to put them," she argued. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles alone, the half-cent hike would translate into $388 million 
annually for the county, which voted Aug. 29 to expand the men's detention 
facility by 2,408 beds. The change would expand capacity to 9,000 beds in a 
facility where prisoners are forced to sleep on the floor and even in the 
chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County stands to gain $126 million annually from the increase. In 
anticipation, county supervisors have approved the construction of a 
$700-million central jail near Anaheim Hills.

Ramon Salcido told authorities in a taped confession that he started a grisly 
wine country murder rampage by slitting the throat of daughter Sofia, 4, after 
he had learned she was "not my own," after a night of drugs and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
In the tape played at his preliminary hearing Friday, Salcido said he drove his 
three young daughters to a county dump and one by one took the girls from his 
truck, slashed their throats and threw them down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was drunk. I was out. I took my knife and I cut her throat," he said of 
Sofia. He said he then slashed the throat of Teresa, 1, killing her, and cut 
the throat of Carmina, 2, who survived. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out, I was crying also," Salcido said. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido said his wife Angela had told him that Sofia, their first daughter, had 
not been fathered by him. 
</P>
<P>
"She married me when she was pregnant and then . . . later on, when we was 
married and pregnant, she told me about the little kid that was not my own," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido said he then went to the home of his mother-in-law, Marian Richards, in 
Cotati, killing her and her two daughters, Ruth, 12, and Marie, 8. He then 
returned to his Boyes Hot Springs home and shot his wife before going to the 
Grand Cru winery and killing co-worker Tracey Toovey, which was easy "because 
I've also killed so many." 
</P>
<P>
Salcido sat tensely at the defense table in Municipal Court as the taped 
confession, taken on the April 20 airplane flight from his native Mexico where 
he was captured, was played before a jammed courtroom of about 65 people. 
</P>
<P>
On tape, Salcido said the April 14 rampage was triggered after he had an 
argument with his wife the previous night over child support papers he had been 
served with from a previous marriage. She left him alone with the children, he 
said, and he started drinking beer and taking drugs before putting the girls in 
his car and driving around Sonoma County searching for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
After he slit the throats of the girls, he said he planned to kill himself but 
then decided to murder his mother-in-law because she knew about Sofia not being 
his natural child. Later, returning to his home, he shot his wife point-blank 
in the head when she threatened to call the police. He then called his mother 
in Mexico, told her what happened and that he was going to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I was going to kill myself and she begged me not to but to come and see 
her one last time," Salcido said, adding that he then went and shot Toovey, who 
recently threatened to fire him. "I was scared. I had another shot of champagne 
and I take off. I pick up the phone and I tell my mother I was going to go 
there."

SENATE PASSES BILL THAT BENEFITS BLOOD FIRM OWNED BY ALLY OF BANE

The state Senate gave final legislative approval Friday to a bill to continue 
allowing the sale of a special blood product from paid donors, a law that would 
benefit a Sherman Oaks firm with ties to co-sponsor Assemblyman Tom Bane. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, approved unanimously without discussion, would renew for three 
years an exemption from a state law that bans the sale of blood products from 
paid donors. 
</P>
<P>
HemaCare Corp. of Sherman Oaks, which has made campaign contributions to Bane 
(D-Tarzana), is one of only two firms in the U.S. that sell blood platelets 
from paid donors, according to HemaCare officials. Platelets promote blood 
clotting and are used by patients undergoing heart surgery or chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials and private blood banks have long opposed the use of 
purchased blood, arguing that it might jeopardize public health because payment 
attracts indigent donors more likely to be infected with hepatitis and other 
diseases. The state has banned use of purchased blood in transfusions since 
1974, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blood Shortage 
</P>
<P>
However, the state Health Services Department did not oppose the exemption 
because extra blood is needed to cover a shortage in Southern California, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bane sponsored legislation in 1986 creating a three-year exemption from the 
law, allowing the use of paid platelets if blood given by volunteers was 
unavailable. He said Friday he intended to carry the new bill but was forced to 
back off because of adverse publicity over his links to HemaCare. He was listed 
as a co-author. 
</P>
<P>
Bane's involvement generated controversy because HemaCare, located in his 40th 
Assembly District, has contributed $4,850 to Bane campaign committees over the 
past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, HemaCare's medical director, Dr. Joshua Levy, is a longtime 
friend of Bane and provided important medical referrals when the lawmaker was 
stricken in 1984 with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a sometimes fatal ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Bane also drew criticism for trying to steer $400,000 in state funds for study 
of the relative safety of paid versus voluntary blood, a move critics said was 
intended to benefit HemaCare. 
</P>
<P>
Bane and HemaCare officials denied that the platelet bill, which goes to Gov. 
Deukmejian for his signature, is special-interest legislation designed 
exclusively to help the firm. "The most important thing about this is the 
benefits to patients who don't get bad blood," Bane said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harvest Process Lauded 
</P>
<P>
Bane and HemaCare insist platelets from paid donors are safer because of 
screening safeguards and the process used to harvest them, known as 
hemapheresis. 
</P>
<P>
Under it, enough platelets for a single transfusion can be taken from a single 
donor. By contrast, blood must be taken from six to 10 volunteers to get the 
same amount of platelets. Paid blood proponents argue that increases the chance 
of contamination six to 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
The state Health Services Department counters that studies have shown 
paid-donor blood is far more likely to contain hepatitis because cash rewards 
attract high-risk donors. They also argue that paid donors are less likely to 
tell the truth about their medical history during screening interviews. 
</P>
<P>
HemaCare argues that those studies are outdated and irrelevant because its 
donors are middle-class college students and hospital employees, not Skid Row 
denizens. The firm's donors must be paid because the harvesting process takes 
several hours and involves physical discomfort, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was introduced by Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin), who has said he 
carried the legislation because it represents a chance to increase the safety 
of blood supplies.

DRUNK DRIVER SENTENCED TO AT LEAST 21 YEARS IN CRASH 
</P>

<P>
A Santa Barbara carpenter received a 21-years-to-life prison sentence Friday 
for driving drunk and causing a crash that killed a Sylmar woman and seriously 
injured three people. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Edward Dewey, 36, was convicted in June by a Van Nuys Superior Court jury 
of second-degree murder in the May 21, 1988, crash that killed Sylvia Martinez, 
39. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Dewey had four prior convictions for driving under the influence of 
alcohol, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles levied the maximum 
sentence of 15 years to life. Mireles added a consecutive six-year prison term 
for two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol, causing great bodily 
harm and one count of driving with an expired license. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stiff," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Rebecca DeWees, "but if this man goes 
back on the street, he's going to kill someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Rand S. Rubin, Dewey's attorney, had asked that his client be sentenced to 
probation and ordered to attend an alcohol-treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
Before sentencing, Dewey told the judge he wished he "could turn back the hands 
of time. I'm very, very sorry," he said. "None of this should ever have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
But Marta Calderon, 29, the driver of the car in which Martinez was a 
passenger, told the judge: "He's saying he's sorry, but it's too late." She 
said that she lost an eye and that her daughter, then 8 months old, suffered a 
broken leg and had to undergo brain surgery as a result of the accident. 
Another passenger suffered stomach, neck and head injuries and required plastic

Dewey was traveling at 70 m.p.h. when he drove his truck into the back of 
Calderon's car at Hubbard Street and Eldridge Avenue in Sylmar, DeWees said.

Tests of a blood sample obtained from Dewey after the accident showed a 
blood-alcohol level of .27%, nearly three times the state's legal standard for 
drunkenness, she added.

WATER AGENCY BIDS FOR SAUGUS PARCEL; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. OFFERED $15.8 MILLION FOR SITE OF PROPOSED TREATMENT PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Castaic Lake Water Agency, trying to push forward a public-works project 
that has been stalled for months, has offered Los Angeles $15.8 million for the 
defunct Saugus Rehabilitation Center, which has 520 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The water agency wants 65 to 80 acres for a treatment plant it says is needed 
to serve the rapidly growing Santa Clarita Valley by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council wants the rest of the property for a city hall, 
a park and perhaps an arts complex. The city and water agency agreed to work 
together to buy the property, which is southeast of the conjunction of Bouquet 
Canyon and Seco Canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has been waiting for months for Los Angeles to release an appraisal 
of the property. Los Angeles officials have completed their appraisal but have 
refused to release it, said Robert C. Sagehorn, the water agency's general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Sagehorn predicted that Los Angeles' appraisal will put a higher value on the 
property than the water agency's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're a little apart," he said. The agency's appraisal was performed 
by Verne Cox, a private appraiser from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials familiar with the bid could not be reached for comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The agency directors have said they are prepared to condemn the Saugus property 
for the public good if necessary and have retained an attorney specializing in 
condemnations. But in its bid submitted to Los Angeles Tuesday, the agency 
promised not to start condemnation proceedings for at least 60 days to give the 
city and agency time to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) announced the 
death of a bill that included the Saugus Rehabilitation Center in a complicated 
land swap that would preserve Elsmere Canyon outside Santa Clarita as a dump 
site. Berman said the bill was dead for this congressional session but would 
probably be revived later. (See story, page 10.) 
</P>
<P>
To entice Santa Clarita not to oppose a dump in Elsmere Canyon, the bill 
suggested deeding the rehabilitation center to Santa Clarita. Santa Clarita 
officials repeatedly said they have not been included in negotiations over the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Sagehorn said the water agency also has been excluded from the negotiations. 
"That's always been a rather confusing activity that we have never been part 
of," Sagehorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Sagehorn said he could not predict whether the bill's demise would affect the 
agency's plans to buy the rehabilitation center.

AN UNSTICKY ANIMAL FAIRY TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's something delightfully pure and fresh about the children's film "The 
Adventures of Milo &amp; Otis" (citywide). 
</P>
<P>
This epic fairy tale about male bonding between an orange kitten and a 
pug-nosed puppy, refashioned from Masanori Hata's Japanese movie "The 
Adventures of Chatran," is full of clean sunlight and waving grass. Populated 
entirely with animals from Hata's private island menagerie -- bears, foxes and 
snakes as well as the usual barnyard assortment -- it generates the blissfully 
dry sense of wonder the best children's books or movies often do. 
</P>
<P>
Hata creates a little world, as magically detailed as Oz, Wonderland or Pooh 
Corner. And he draws us into it, serenely, effortlessly -- guiding us along a 
rushing river where the frightened kitten, Milo, is swept along in a runaway 
crate; following the puppy, Otis, as he chases along the banks; pausing 
quizzically over the antics of a fox, the stately stare of an owl and the 
relentless pursuit by a bear; lingering on the snowy forest that eventually 
imprisons Milo, Otis and their respective families. Then gazing out to the sea, 
as Otis stands stranded on a tide-lashed rock, ultimately rescued by a 
disgruntled but duty-bound sea turtle. 
</P>
<P>
The basic story deals with the friendship of all animals, exemplified by Otis's 
yearlong expedition to rescue his childhood companion. It's an idealistic 
theme. Obviously, it translates to universal community among all species. Yet 
there's nothing sticky about the movie's visual execution. In its original 
Japanese form, "Milo and Otis" may well be a classic. And even in its shortened 
American version -- with roguish narration by Dudley Moore, a bouncy score and 
a ricky-tick country-Western theme song that's a real mistake -- it's 
engrossing, genuinely heartwarming stuff. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly unique. Hata hasn't used the conventional method of training the 
animals to perform according to a pre-existing scenario, tricking or teasing 
them. The animal actors, including as many as 30 roughly identical kittens or 
puppies pressed into service as Milo or Otis, were filmed in their natural 
environment responding to situations Hata and his crew helped create. This 
makes the movie the animal equivalent of an "improvised" drama like John 
Cassavetes' "Shadows" or Henry Jaglom's "Always." 
</P>
<P>
The movie is full of what Francois Truffaut called "privileged moments": little 
jolts of charm or reality. One scene, where Milo and Otis watch a chick 
emerging from his egg and then nuzzle him as he stretches out, strikes me as a 
more impressive achievement -- at least a more heartening one -- than anything 
in "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
Hata worked on the film for more than four years, turning to one of the great 
masters of the Japanese cinema, Kon Ichikawa, to help him edit the unwieldly 
mass; Ichikawa's title here is "associate director." The director of "Fires on 
the Plain" and "The Makioka Sisters" is no stranger to animal or children's 
films. He's directed Topo Gigio, the Italian-mouse puppet, and another of his 
movies is an adaptation of Natsuke Sosemi's "I am a Cat," a Japanese literary 
classic from a cat's eye view. He has strong affinity for the material and he 
helps give the movie a seamless shape and flow. 
</P>
<P>
"The Adventures of Milo and Otis" (MPAA-rated G) is an unabashed children's 
film, made with a wit and intelligence that adults can enjoy too. It reminds us 
that sometimes it takes the purest sophistication to see with an innocent eye. 
Just as Milo and Otis, drifting kitten and determined pup, learn that they're 
not alone in the world -- so, perhaps, will the children and parents who will 
see, and love, this movie. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

STORY STRUGGLES TO RECONCILE MEXICAN, U.S VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first element one expects to be struck by in "Simply Maria, or the American 
Dream" is that it is the work of a young playwright, Josefina Lopez, who was 
only 17 when she sent the play to the California Young Playwrights Project two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
How delightful then to find that this one-act play, as seen in a KPBS-TV 
production, is a touching tale of a young girl's struggle to reconcile her 
traditional Mexican values with America. The play has rough edges, both in 
production and writing, but an unmistakably strong -- and often funny -- voice 
clearly comes through. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly autobiographical, "Simply Maria," a co-production by Sarah Luft of 
KPBS-TV and Deborah Salzer of the playwrights project, tackles the marriage of 
her parents and the lessons they try to impart in brief vignettes that move 
swiftly from reality to fantasy. To be a good Mexican girl, must Maria marry 
and have children just like her mother? As an American girl, isn't she entitled 
to compete and explore and have adventures? And can she be a hybrid, a 
hyphenated Mexican-American, walking a tightrope between two cultures, without 
compromising herself? 
</P>
<P>
What saves Lopez's strong, feminist message from being didactic is her biting 
sense of humor and her style, as witnessed in a wedding scene. The priest asks 
the woman a long litany of questions, including, "Do you promise to love him 
even if he beats you and in return ask for nothing?" and ends with "You may pet 
the bride." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's courage in following the furthest reaches of her own imagination is her 
strength. Her creation of three female figures, who serve a variety of roles 
from Greek chorus to Maria's inner and outer voices, is inspired. Her flaw is 
that she does not focus more attention on her central character. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, her youth shows in the groping way in which she tries to deal with 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
If we could see more of Maria's tenderness in her relations with her parents or 
the Mexican boy she fantasizes as marrying, the conflict in her heart would be 
more deeply affecting. 
</P>
<P>
The direction by Luis Torner and Donn Johnson keeps things flowing nicely. 
There is an innocence to the unpolished but earnest acting by the ensemble -- a 
simplicity matched by Beeb Salzer's utilitarian set design. Amy Jacobson's 
performance as Maria stands out in its exploration of the painful shadows 
lurking under the role. Lawrence Czoka's sound design weaves in a subtle, but 
unmistakably Mexican flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The playwrights project, which encourages young writers to express themselves, 
could not have found a better ambassador than Lopez, who seems so utterly 
unafraid to say what she thinks. One moment she attacks Mexican machismo, in 
the next she guns down America in a scene in which Maria's father is sneaking 
into the country. While the Statue of Liberty smiles beneficently on some 
immigrants, it is quite a different story as she turns her torch into a 
spotlight in an attempt to stop Maria's father from entering the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Lopez's complaints with her father, they have something in common -- 
there is no stopping her, either.

BRADLEY VETOES $2.5 MILLION FOR FOOT PATROLS AS TOO COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asserting his rarely used veto power, Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday cut the 
funding for a popular police foot-patrol program, calling the $2.5-million 
appropriation a "raid on the city's reserve fund." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual veto -- made even more surprising as it came four days after the 
program's high-profile kickoff in crime-ridden MacArthur Park -- raised the 
eyebrows of council members still mulling the mayor's future political 
effectiveness after the damaging findings of the city attorney's six-month 
investigation of Bradley's finances. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to put that behind him, then he has got to deal with the issues 
and play a leadership role," said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who said she 
supports the mayor's veto. "It looks like he's back with us." 
</P>
<P>
In his veto message, which aides said the mayor personally drafted early 
Wednesday morning even as the city attorney's report was being delivered to his 
office, Bradley said: "I share the council's concern that the police should 
have a greater presence in critical areas of the city." But, the mayor wrote, 
"I believe the additional foot patrols can be deployed with existing personnel 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the Los Angeles Police Department has begun sending patrols 
of 10 to 20 officers to walk beats in 18 crime "hot spots" citywide. The 
$2.5-million appropriation would have carried the program through the remaining 
10 months of the city's fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who has vetoed fewer than 20 of the hundreds of ordinances that 
crossed his desk so far this year, said he will support a scaled-down 
three-month pilot program with a budget "not to exceed $750,000." And he said 
he will consider future funding when the results of the pilot are in. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the veto, LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said, the patrols will 
continue as the issue gets hashed out in the City Council. "We're assuming the 
council will agree with the mayor's (three-month plan), and we will continue to 
field the foot beats," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
A Bradley spokesman said the timing of the veto had nothing to do with the city 
attorney's report being issued earlier in the week. "It's obviously an action 
the mayor thought was necessary, no matter what week it was," said Bill 
Chandler, a spokesman for the mayor. The mayor had until next Friday to accept 
or reject the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro speculated that despite the strong 10-2 
vote on which the council approved the foot patrols on Sept. 6, Bradley will 
likely have sufficient votes to sustain the veto because allies and foes alike 
came to the mayor's support Friday. Ten votes of the 15-member council are 
necessary to sustain or override a mayoral veto. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who voted for the original measure despite 
concerns over funding, said he will support the mayor's veto. "I supported the 
three-month plan (when proposed at council), and I will support the mayor," 
said Alatorre, a Bradley supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a frequent Bradley critic who had voted for the 
foot patrols, also plans to vote with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"He did the right thing," Yaroslavsky said. "The program should proceed, but in 
a financially responsible way. We can have foot beats and not break the bank." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he wants the program funded from a growing surplus in the 
Police Department's budget. According to a report by the city administrative 
office, the LAPD has a $1.3-million surplus in its salary account due to 
unfilled positions. 
</P>
<P>
The CAO report recommended against adoption of the program. The city's research 
office concluded that police foot patrols are typically ineffective and put 
officers at a high risk. 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the police force is budgeted for an all-time high of 
8,414 sworn officers -- representing a growth of 22% in seven years. "This 
could provide an adequate resource pool from which to draw foot patrols if they 
are effective," the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was some stiff and immediate opposition to the veto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Malarkey' 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lot of malarkey," Councilman Ernani Bernardi said. "We don't need a 
pilot program to tell us we need more cops on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, who authored the original proposal and navigated it 
through the council, said: "I can't believe it. . . . He's slapped the public 
in the face." Holden said he expects a public outcry, but it is unclear whether 
that may enable him to secure 10 votes needed to override the veto. 
</P>
<P>
But even the LAPD does not consider the foot patrol program a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say foot patrols are effective in small areas, but overall, they are 
inefficient, expensive and a "luxury," according to Booth. 
</P>
<P>
"If the council wants these beats established and wants these kinds of police 
services, we'll certainly do it," Booth said. "What they want to fund, we'll 
provide."

DESIGNER RUBEN PANIS FOUND SLAIN; 
</P>
<P>
FLAMBOYANT CLOTHIER IS STRANGLED IN HIS WILSHIRE-AREA HOME 
</P>

<P>
Ruben Panis, a high-priced fashion designer who outfitted the likes of Zsa Zsa 
Gabor and Mayor Tom Bradley's wife, Ethel, in his signature beadwork evening 
gowns, was found strangled in his two-story Wilshire District home Friday 
morning, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Family members discovered Panis, 57, in the master bedroom shortly after 9 a.m. 
There was no evidence of forced entry into the Spanish-style house on South 
Tremaine Avenue, according to Wilshire Division Detective Dan Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
Panis' cars, a 1977 Mercedes-Benz 450 SL and a 1988 Honda Civic, were missing 
from his garage and Andrews said the cars represented the only leads in the 
case. Detectives were trying to determine whether other items were stolen from 
Panis' residence. 
</P>
<P>
"The house is a very nice residence with a lot of antique furniture and 
artwork," Andrews said. "We really haven't had an opportunity to inventory it . 
. . but the house didn't look disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
Panis' friends on Friday were shocked by news of his death. The flamboyant 
designer was described as a jovial and generous man who enjoyed traveling to 
Mexico and socializing with the Hollywood stars and society matrons who 
patronized his exclusive evening wear shops. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody loved him," said Bill Sarris, a fellow designer and longtime friend. 
"He was a joy to be around. . . . I can't imagine anyone not liking him or 
wanting to harm him." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time however, those close to Panis said it was common knowledge in 
fashion circles that he was experiencing financial difficulties. His Melrose 
Avenue dress shop was seized by the Internal Revenue Service last week for 
delinquent taxes. An IRS spokeswoman said that Panis owed about $50,000 in 
employment taxes dating back to early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at his other shop in downtown Los Angeles refused to discuss the 
designer on Friday. But a Melrose merchant said Panis' employees were unaware 
of the closure until they showed up for work and found the doors locked and IRS 
seizure notices posted on the building. 
</P>
<P>
One friend, who asked not to be identified, said Panis had lost interest in the 
business he spent 20 years building and had spent most of his time traveling 
during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"He went from being a workaholic to simply not caring," the friend said. "And 
there was no reason for it, because his business had been very successful. His 
dresses were expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Panis, who was born in Manila, got his start designing costumes in Las Vegas. 
Friends said he moved to Los Angeles about 20 years ago, where he established 
himself as a top-flight local designer able to command $900 to $5,000 for his 
original creations. 
</P>
<P>
His clothes could be found at exclusive stores such as I. Magnin in the past, 
but he sold mostly out of his design shops. Commenting on his typical clients, 
Panis once said they were "at least age 50 and rich." 
</P>
<P>
Panis' clients included both Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor, as well as actress Rhonda 
Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
Sidoione, owner of Sidoione, a vintage clothing shop next door to Panis' 
Melrose studio, said: "I've seen Zsa Zsa Gabor's Rolls-Royce parked in front of 
here many times." 
</P>
<P>
One of Panis' most loyal customers was Ethel Bradley, who named him her dress 
designer for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Panis had recently served 
on the city's Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a shocking thing," said Mayor Bradley, who had appointed him to the 
commission. "Ruben Panis was a gentle, kind man."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDERER OF HAHN'S NIECE TO GET PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a plea bargain that spares him a possible death sentence, a man pleaded 
guilty Friday to stabbing to death a niece of Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn during a 1987 residential robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Ulivarri, 24, pleaded guilty in Superior Court in Norwalk to one count 
each of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder of a neighbor of 
Hahn's niece and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Ulivarri also admitted a special-circumstance allegation, murder during a 
robbery, that would normally make him subject to a possible death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But in return for his guilty pleas, the district attorney's office said it will 
not seek a death sentence against him. Instead, Ulivarri will be sentenced to 
life in prison without parole for the murder of Ramona Gayton, 40. Sentencing 
was set for Oct. 12.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAND-SWAP BILL FOR DUMP DEAD FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A complex land-swap bill that could meet Los Angeles' need for a new garbage 
dump will not be passed by Congress this year because city, county and federal 
officials have failed to reach agreement, the measure's sponsor said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are essentially past the time when we can move something through Congress," 
said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). "If we can work something out, we 
can get it through early next year." 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping bill could open the way for a new landfill in Elsmere Canyon. It 
could also provide the city with a third of its future electric power, improve 
the run-down Hansen Dam recreation area in the northeast San Fernando Valley 
and preserve scenic canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their disappointment in the delay, city and county officials expressed 
optimism that they have made enough behind-the-scenes progress in recent weeks. 
Berman will revise the land-exchange bill, a preliminary version of which he 
first introduced last February, when Congress reconvenes in early 1990.

A Vietnamese woman whose naked, screaming image as a child in 1972 became one 
of the enduring symbols of the Vietnam War has indefinitely postponed her trip 
to the United States, an American sponsor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Phan Thi Kim Phuc, 26, decided to cancel the trip she had planned this month 
primarily because of health reasons, said Merle Ratner, her spokeswoman in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The shocking black-and-white photograph of 9-year-old Kim, screaming in pain 
and horror as she ran naked down a road after a South Vietnamese air raid, 
received a Pulitzer Prize. 
</P>
<P>
What is not shown in the photo, said Los Angeles-based Associated Press 
Photographer Nick Ut, who took the picture and was instrumental in saving Kim's 
life, is that her body was "like barbecue." Kim, who had received permission 
from Vietnam to tour the United State, still suffers physical problems from the 
burns.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOCTOR'S ACCOUNTS OF DEATH DIFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale physician accused in a murder-for-insurance conspiracy gave 
authorities conflicting accounts of how a man came to die last year in his 
office, a death prosecutors now say was a well-planned murder, a Los Angeles 
Municipal Court judge was told Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor, Richard Pryde Boggs, 56, is accused, along with two Ohio 
businessmen, of killing the man, passing him off as one of the businessmen and 
then collecting $1.5 million on the businessman's life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
The businessman whose death was allegedly faked, Melvin Eugene Hanson, 48, was 
arrested earlier this year -- with a fresh face lift, varying pieces of 
personal identification and $14,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Killed was Ellis H. Greene, a 31-year-old San Fernando Valley accountant found 
with papers on him that identified him as Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
On April 16, 1988, Boggs summoned Glendale officials to his office, where they 
found Greene's body. Boggs told fire and police officials separately that the 
man was Hanson, and he died of a heart attack while in Boggs' office. 
</P>
<P>
According to Glendale Police Detective Jerry Jones, Boggs said Hanson was 
driven to the office by another person. But Glendale Fire Capt. Stuart Jones 
testified that Boggs said he had personally driven to the man's home in 
Hollywood and brought him back to his office.

BREAK WITH CATHOLIC CHURCH; 
</P>
<P>
DIGNITY 'MANIFESTO' CALLS GAY SEXUALITY A 'HOLY GIFT' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dignity, the embattled organization of gay Roman Catholics, recently adopted a 
"manifesto" on sexual ethics that makes a sharp departure from traditional 
church teaching and celebrates gay sexuality as a "holy gift." 
</P>
<P>
The document is expected to widen the breach that has developed in recent years 
between the organization and church leadership and between organization members 
who differ on the matter of opposing the church. According to a Dignity 
spokesman, there are about 5,000 members in the group's 110 chapters. 
</P>
<P>
The Dignity document, passed at a national meeting early this month, dismisses 
church teaching on sexuality that maintains that only sex open to procreation 
within marriage is morally good. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
View Held 'Unacceptable' 
</P>
<P>
That view, Dignity said, "is not in touch with human experience" and 
"increasingly is regarded as irrelevant and unacceptable" to both gay and 
heterosexual people. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to church teaching, Dignity calls gay sexuality "the holy 
gift of God. The overwhelming majority of us are able to say we are both 
sexually active and comfortable in our relationship with Christ. Being sexually 
active enables us to be more at ease with ourselves, more fulfilled in our 
relationships, more productive in our work and service. The Spirit is evident 
in a warmer and more peaceful prayer life." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger issued an official letter which called 
homosexuality "intrinsically disordered." Ratzinger also demanded that any 
group disagreeing with that assessment or supporting homosexuality should not 
receive any church assistance, including use of church property. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years that followed, Dignity groups in 17 cities, including Los 
Angeles and New York, were ordered off church property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Accepted Teaching 
</P>
<P>
During much of Dignity's 17-year history, the organization begrudgingly 
accepted the church teaching that while homosexual orientation is not sinful in 
itself, homosexual activity is. But the now famous "Ratzinger letter" of 1986 
was viewed by Dignity members and others as an effort by the Vatican to end 
that approach and to place a moral shadow on the condition of homosexuality 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
That letter had the effect of backing Dignity into a corner, and the 
organization, after an intense internal battle, decided to come out fighting. 
At the organization's last national convention in 1987 in Miami, Dignity 
members who oppose church teaching about homosexual activity gained the upper 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Dignity members at that session voted to issue a statement asserting that gay 
and lesbian relationships are morally good. 
</P>
<P>
Some Catholic bishops reacted with anger and other dozen Dignity chapters, 
including the chapter in San Francisco, were expelled from church property. 
</P>
<P>
Dignity leaders are unconcerned that the sexual ethics manifesto it issued last 
week might further alienate it from the church they say they love. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sexual Galileos," said Kevin Calegari, a San Francisco Dignity leader. 
"The church is saying the world is flat when they say the only morally good sex 
is within a heterosexual marriage aimed at procreation. Well, the world isn't 
flat, and everybody seems to know that but the church." 
</P>
<P>
The Dignity manifesto claims to offer a new sexual morality for gays and others 
"sexually disenfranchised" by the church, including "the divorced, widowed, 
handicapped and the single." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Context of Relationship' 
</P>
<P>
Sister Jeannine Gramick, a nun who has been involved in ministry to gays and 
lesbians since 1971 and was a founder of several Dignity chapters, said the new 
document "attempts to put the whole area of sexual ethics in the context of 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not sanctioning promiscuity," she said. "It is talking about the 
viability and goodness of expressing one's sexual gifts in the context of a 
love relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Dignity, in attempting to develop such an ethic for homosexuals, is caught 
between the absolute church prohibition of homosexual expression and the wider 
community of homosexuals who have no religious affiliation in which there is 
little restriction on sexual activity, Gramick said.

BRUINS LOOK TO GET EVEN

<TEXT>
<P>
When the San Diego State football team heard that UCLA lost last Saturday's 
season opener to Tennessee, it was not sure if it was reason to hope or fear. 
</P>
<P>
The hope came from a belief that the Bruin team it will play host to tonight at 
7 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium might not be as good as those that have 
soundly beaten the Aztecs in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But the fear came from a feeling that No. 20 UCLA might be a bit more inspired 
to play the winless Aztecs after that 24-6 loss to then-unranked Tennessee. 
Judging from comments by UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, that concern is justified. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say our team will go down there with a different attitude than if we had 
blown Tennessee out of the Rose Bowl," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
That can only mean trouble for San Diego State, which lost its opener, 52-36, 
two weeks ago at Air Force and has lost all five UCLA games by increasing 
margins since the series was resumed in 1984 after a 50-year break. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of those games was close -- 18-15 in San Diego in 1984 -- and the past 
three have had a combined score of 151-34. Last year's 59-6 victory in the Rose 
Bowl was the Bruins' easiest since a 62-3 defeat of Washington State in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
With recent history as a guide, the game against the Aztecs figures to be only 
an easy diversion between the Tennessee loss and next week's game against No. 2 
Michigan in the Rose Bowl. But in light of the showing against the Volunteers, 
Donahue also has issued some words of caution. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a good football team right now," Donahue said. "Some of our problems 
can be corrected, but some, quite frankly, cannot." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said he is most concerned about defense, particularly linebackers and 
the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the depth that we have had in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins yielded 376 yards to Tennessee, including 247 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
That might sound like a lot to Donahue, but it is stingy when compared with San 
Diego State. The Aztecs allowed 618 total yards and a school-record 559 rushing 
to Air Force's wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
The performance was typical for an Aztec defense that has ranked near the 
bottom of National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division I-A the past two 
seasons. But it was upsetting to Al Luginbill, San Diego State's first-year 
coach. Luginbill, a former defensive coordinator at Arizona State, took over 
the Aztec program last November with a pledge to build a strong defense after 
serving three years as an assistant athletic director at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Predecessor Denny Stolz was fired, two years after leading the school to its 
first Western Athletic Conference title, largely because of poor defensive play 
that contributed to records of 5-7 in 1987 and 3-8 last year. But despite the 
emphasis on defense in practice, Luginbill found little immediate improvement 
in his first game. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty-two points, that was a new experience," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
The showing was enough for Luginbill to shake up his starting lineup. Steve 
Matuscewicz, a 6-foot-4, 215-pound sophomore from La Puente Nogales High, will 
start at defensive end in place of junior Jason Swaney. Just two weeks earlier, 
Luginbill had said he planned to red-shirt Matuscewicz. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill expects a different kind of running game from the Bruins than the 
wishbone the Aztecs faced against Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA is as physical as I've seen them tackle to tackle," Luginbill said. "(We 
will learn) what will happen if someone hits us in the mouth, and that will 
happen Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA quarterback Bret Johnson (hip pointer), tight end Corwin Anthony (knee), 
inside linebacker Pat McPherson (hamstring), cornerback Michael Williams 
(broken thumb) and free safety Eric Turner (bruised knee) are all expected to 
play despite minor injuries. Tight end Charles Arbuckle (sprained ankle) and 
cornerback Randy Beverly (broken toe) did not play against Tennessee and are 
listed as questionable. . . . San Diego State will be without wide receiver 
Patrick Rowe, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Tuesday to repair 
cartilage damage in his right knee, and reserve defensive Milt Maples (knee 
sprain). Offensive lineman Steve Blyth, who missed the opener at Air Force two 
weeks ago while recovering from knee surgery last spring, has been cleared to 
play. The status of cornerback Marlon Andrews (ankle sprain) is uncertain. He 
has been replaced in the starting lineup by Gary Taylor. . . . UCLA leads the 
series, 11-0-1. The tie came in the third meeting, 13-13, in 1924.

A LOOK AT THIS WEEK'S RAM AND RAIDER OPPONENTS; 
</P>
<P>
AN AGING AFC RIVALRY REMAINS IN FULL FLOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After center Mike Webster of the Pittsburgh Steelers announced he was quitting 
football at the end of last season, his teammates held a retirement dinner. He 
got a gold watch, and teammates and friends roasted him. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who has played in nine Pro Bowls, more than any other center, and was 
on four Super Bowl champions, is certain to make the Hall of Fame. With his 
receding hairline and fleshy facial features, he resembles one of the bronze 
busts at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
However, Webster's retirement was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
After being hired as a Kansas City Chiefs assistant coach, Webster reconsidered 
and announced that he was returning for his 16th season. He signed a one-year 
contract with Kansas City as a Plan B free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish that Webster had stayed a coach," said Raider Coach Mike Shanahan, 
whose team plays the Chiefs on Sunday at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Webster, 37, postpone retirement? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long story," he said. "It (playing) was something that was never out of 
the question. But at my age you have to take a little bit of time to see if you 
can make it through the off-season conditioning program." 
</P>
<P>
How many more years does he plan to play? 
</P>
<P>
"Years?" Webster asked. "Take that down into a little smaller time frame, like 
minutes and days. I know when I was younger there were days when I felt like I 
was 50. Now I feel like I'm 70 some days." 
</P>
<P>
Webster's decision caught Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern was that I wanted to be sure that he wanted to play because 
I didn't want to have to cut a guy who was headed to the Hall of Fame," 
Schottenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth-round draft choice from Wisconsin in 1974, Webster spent two years as a 
reserve behind Ray Mansfield before moving into the Steeler starting lineup. 
Webster played in a record 220 games for the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
He said it has been hard adjusting to a new team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult, but I'm a professional and that's the way I would have done it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve DeBerg and Webster are the oldest starting center and 
quarterback combination in the National Football League this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think of it that way," Webster said. "We just have a job to do and we 
let other people decide whether or not age is significant." 
</P>
<P>
Webster had brought stability to the rebuilding Chiefs, who gave up more sacks 
than any AFC team except the Raiders last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's done a very good job for us," Schottenheimer said. "We feel he's 
performing at least as well if not better than he has for the past few 
seasons." 
</P>
<P>
Some think Webster's decision was financially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike took one look at his first coach's pay check and decided to go back and 
keep playing," said Raider nose tackle Bob Golic, a close friend of Webster. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike fooled me. I fully expected to run over to the sidelines and wave to him. 
I was going to ask him how he was doing and how his body felt. But now I'm 
going to have a much closer opportunity to see him Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
There were flowers waiting for Webster when he arrived at practice one day last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Webster was startled when he opened the card, which read: "Thinking of you on 
our seventh anniversary. Love, Bob Golic." 
</P>
<P>
Golic, who had been playing against Webster twice a season for seven years, 
decided to send Webster a bouquet of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was playing in Cleveland last year, somebody wrote an article that it 
was the seventh year in a row that Mike and I had been playing each other. My 
wife (Jackie) read it and said, 'You two have been playing each other longer 
than we've been married,' " Golic said. 
</P>
<P>
"So I ordered the Merlin Olsen congratulations bouquet and I sent it to him in 
Pittsburgh. I don't know if he liked it or not. He didn't play any easier 
against me." 
</P>
<P>
Webster didn't appreciate the gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't call those flowers," Webster said. "Those were kind of a makeup of 
pollen and ragweed. He knew I had allergies." 
</P>
<P>
Webster and Golic maintained a running commentary during their meetings when 
Webster was with Pittsburgh and Golic was in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"We always talked during the games, but it wasn't the violent, vicious 'I'm 
going to kill you' type of thing you normally hear," Golic said. 
</P>
<P>
"One year I hurt my knee against Seattle and I wasn't supposed to play the next 
week against Pittsburgh. But they had a special brace made up for me so I could 
play the Steelers that next week, and I was pumped up and ready to play 
(Webster). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm panting and I'm drooling for effect to scare him. And as I get down in my 
stance he says, 'Hi Bob, how's your knee?' It totally broke my concentration. 
It really threw me off. It just killed me the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Once, Webster even apologized after the Steelers triple-teamed Golic. 
</P>
<P>
"Pittsburgh did a lot of double- teaming and on one particular play Mike fired 
out and hit me and both guards came down and hit me and my heels stuck in the 
Astroturf," Golic said. "I did a somersault backward and the linebackers were 
jumping out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"The next play I said, 'Mike, that was a hell of a blocking scheme and he said, 
'Bob, I want to apologize to you. Only two of us were supposed to hit you.' He 
was really polite." 
</P>
<P>
When Webster and Golic meet Sunday, it will be the 16th time they have played 
against each other in eight years. Those battles were with Pittsburgh and 
Cleveland, but both are with different teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be strange not seeing him in a black and gold uniform, but then 
it's going to be different envisioning me in something other than a big orange 
head," Golic said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Webster: "It's going to be what I call a Turtle Day, where you've got to 
stick your neck back in your body and just start ramming it in there because 
you know you're going to be sore at the end of the day.' 
</P>
<P>
But the Golic-Webster matchups haven't been all laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Golic suffered two injuries against the Steelers, a broken thumb in a 1984 
exhibition game and a broken arm in the final game of the 1987 season, an 
injury that sidelined him for the playoffs and the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone have an edge in the Webster-Golic rivalry? 
</P>
<P>
"It's always one of the focal points of our games," Schottenheimer said. 
"They're two great competitors who are relentless in the pursuit of their 
objectives. But I couldn't say one dominated." 
</P>
<P>
Golic recalled the battles with Webster fondly. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of good battles," Golic said. "He's a tremendous lineman, one 
of the best I've ever played against. And as he gets older one thing I'm 
finding out is that his skills don't diminish. I've got the feeling that one 
day he'll retire as good a ballplayer as he was when he walked into the league, 
if not better."

IRSAY'S CHARGE OF DEATH THREATS COMES AS NEWS TO FBI OFFICIALS

<TEXT>
<P>
That anyone would, as alleged, threaten the life of Robert Irsay because, 
according to him, he won't give the name "Colts" back to Baltimore -- where it 
rightfully belongs -- defies believability. Then Irsay, via the course of 
conversation, brings the FBI into the proceedings, except for one extremely 
vital detail. The Bureau doesn't know anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario unfolded when Irsay, the Colts' owner who stripped Baltimore of 
its identity and, as a thief in the night, took the team to Indianapolis in 
1984, claimed a letter he received placed his life in danger. He said the 
unknown writer was angered because Irsay wouldn't allow the "Colts" name to 
return here when an expansion franchise is awarded. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Baltimore wants along with a new team -- its old name but not the 
buffoon known as Irsay, who now claims there has been a written demand on his 
life. The story by the Associated Press was transmitted to news outlets around 
the country. It reads: 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis Colts owner Robert Irsay said Monday he still receives occasional 
death threats concerning the team's nickname five years after he moved the 
franchise from Baltimore. The latest threat came as recently as a week ago, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Irsay did not say where the threat originated or how it was sent to him. "We're 
not letting the Colts' name go," he said at the Indianapolis News' Downtown 
Quarterbacks Club luncheon. "Legally, we have it. It's binding." Irsay, who did 
not appear worried about the threats, said the threats have been reported to 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper hosting the luncheon reacted in a strange way. It buried the 
story in the sports pages. Here was the most famous adopted son of 
Indianapolis, the owner of its pro football club, reporting his life was 
threatened because he wouldn't give up the name Colts and the development 
wasn't considered important enough to be placed in a position of prominence. In 
fact, the newspaper merely published the AP story rather than writing a new, 
and more complete, one of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, evaluating the importance of news is a subjective matter. But here 
was the "hero" who robbed Baltimore and fled to Indianapolis, given such little 
attention in the public prints when his life was on the line. Doesn't Irsay 
deserve better than that? 
</P>
<P>
A life-threatening situation always has to be dealt with on the basis of 
reality until proven otherwise. In the interest of assessing the validity of 
Irsay's claim with the FBI, there is absolutely no report in any of three 
offices -- Baltimore, Indianapolis and Chicago -- to justify the allegation he 
made. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI, alert 24 hours a day in its quest to maintain law and order, has, of 
course, heard of Irsay -- including a previous instance when he insisted he was 
shot at in Chicago while leaving a parking garage. It might have been an 
automobile motor backfiring. As for the latest report, let it be said the FBI 
doesn't have information to support such a contention. 
</P>
<P>
"As of right now," said Jim Dearborn, of the Baltimore FBI force, "we don't 
show anything like that in the records. If there is a death threat in the mails 
we do get involved." 
</P>
<P>
How about in Indianapolis, home grounds for Irsay? John Teeling, the FBI 
spokesman there, advised, "I know of no official investigation of Robert 
Irsay." An almost identical reaction came from Chicago, where FBI man Bob Long 
explained, "I don't know personally of any such complaint. I am not aware of 
it. I don't happen to know of it." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Bob was hallucinating is difficult to determine. He has, however, in 
the past, been guilty of some astonishing assertions. He claimed he was a 
football player at the University of Illinois. But the school had no record he 
ever drew a uniform for a single practice drill. 
</P>
<P>
When coughing, or clearing his throat, he often reminded those around him the 
condition was caused by the malaria he contracted while fighting with the 
Marine Corps on those hellish island campaigns of World War II. It turned out 
he was never in combat and was asked to leave the Marines during the height of 
the war when every available body was so desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
And then, other times, he would exclaim, for no purpose at all, "I'm a good 
Catholic boy." But his brother attempted to correct the record by explaining he 
couldn't understand why Bob was saying that since they were from a Jewish 
family and had gone to the synagogue together. 
</P>
<P>
It remained for his mother, who hadn't seen him for what she said was a period 
of 35 years, to sadly announce to the world that "my son is the devil." What a 
woeful pronouncement. In plundering Baltimore of the football team, Irsay took 
the name that had been linked to the franchise since its 1947 inception in the 
All-America Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The name was supplied by a Baltimore fan, one Charles Evans, who reasoned that 
Baltimore's association with the thoroughbred horse, the fact the team was new 
and the conciseness of the name counted only 4 1/2 units in a headline was 
reason for it being a natural nickname. That's what Irsay took away ... the 
team, the name "Colts" that fit Baltimore so well and his own outlandish 
distortion of the truth.

Melido Perez pitched a two-hitter and struck out 12 as the Chicago White Sox 
ended the Angels' five-game winning streak as they beat them, 3-1, Friday in 
the first game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the third-place Angels 4 1/2 games behind Oakland in the AL 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Perez (10-13) walked two in his first complete game of the season. He held the 
Angels hitless until Devon White got an RBI single with two out in the sixth 
inning, and also allowed Brian Downing's two-out double in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott (11-11) gave up three runs on seven hits in seven innings. Carlos 
Martinez doubled with one out in the second, advanced on a grounder and scored 
on Abbott's wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox made it 2-0 in the fifth when Sammy Sosa led off with a bunt 
single, moved up on a sacrifice and scored on Gallagher's single. Carlton Fisk 
and Martinez opened the seventh with singles, Sosa walked and Karkovice blooped 
a run-scoring single for a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McLemore drew a leadoff walk in the sixth, stole second and scored on 
White's single.

CORNERBACK DARRELL GREEN -- HUMBLE MAN IN A HUMBLING JOB 
</P>

<P>
Twenty years from now, when Jared Green is 20 1/2, he may be quick and fast 
enough to play cornerback. But his father may talk him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a never-relaxing position," said Washington Redskins cornerback Darrell 
Green. "You're always vulnerable. And it doesn't matter how great you were the 
week before." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, there won't be any "vanilla" offenses left in the National Football 
League by the time Jared grows up. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many now, Green said the other day. "Now there are so many mobile 
quarterbacks," he said. "The receiver always has the advantage over us, for the 
simple reason that he knows where he's going and we don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the mobile quarterback can buy that extra tick on the clock, and the 
receiver can make one more move." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday at RFK Stadium, Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham, the most mobile 
quarterback of them all, will be buying time while Green is paying attention 
("and respect") to wide receiver Mike Quick. The Redskins take on the Eagles 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, a five-time Pro Bowler, has caught more touchdowns than anybody active 
in the NFC. He has caught at least one pass in every game he has played since 
Nov. 18, 1984, when Darrell Green shut him out. They know each other well. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a glamorous job," Green said. "Yes, I enjoy it, because I am the 
most fortunate defensive back there is. I get to go against all the best 
receivers in the world: Jerry Rice, Roy Green, Mike Quick. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike and I have become friends and we respect each other," Green said. "Hey, 
Mike Quick can tear me up. I have to approach him with respect or I'll get 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
In his seventh season, with three Pro Bowl elections behind him, Green finds an 
almost chivalrous respect between warriors between the lines. 
</P>
<P>
"After the touchdown Monday night, the guy said, 'That was your ball,' " Green 
reported. "He wanted me to know my coverage was good." 
</P>
<P>
The guy was the New York Giants' Odessa Turner, who had a touchdown when Phil 
Simms' 30-yard pass inexplicably went through Green's hands on the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times I say 'great catch,' or 'good move,' " Green said. "No, I don't 
have bad dreams about getting beat. Every cornerback who ever lines up is going 
to get beat. Mike Haynes, Ray Clayborn, all of them. 
</P>
<P>
"For a guy my size (barely 5-foot-8, maybe 170) to make it, I have to dream big 
dreams, positive dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"I do a good job of not taking negative things home," Green said. "It would 
affect my home, and this is only my job. I am first a servant of God, second a 
husband and father." 
</P>
<P>
The Bible teaches of the uses of adversity, and Green has found value in the 
high visibility, and the sometimes unfairness, of cornerbacks' embarrassments. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes my speed brings me to a play (outside his responsibility) and they 
say, 'Oh, he got beat.' They don't know what defense we were in. Linemen blow 
plays all the time and nobody says, 'He got burned.' 
</P>
<P>
"But it makes a good tool when I speak to the kids," Green said. Besides his 
Darrell Green Foundation, he is active in Big Brothers and other youth programs 
in which he addresses age groups from age 7 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I can walk off the field as 'the guy who lost the game,' " Green said, "and 
know it's not my fault. I would never blame somebody else, so what can I do? 
</P>
<P>
"Beat my wife? Kill my dog? Give up? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the difference between being a great cornerback and a good one: 
the ability to be secure in who you are, not to be a different person because 
you got beat. 
</P>
<P>
"So how about these kids?" Green said. "One who can't talk well, one who 
doesn't do well in school. Another who's not handsome, doesn't have good 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not their fault either, I tell them. So what should they do? Put their 
head in the sand? Drop out of school? Take drugs, or drink alcohol? 
</P>
<P>
"They've got to go on, and do their best. I think they get the message."

David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Assn., said that the Board 
of Governors will further study the need for a weighted lottery at their next 
meeting in early October at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, in Palm Springs at a meeting of NBA general managers and officials, said 
that with the recent NBA expansion of four teams there may be a need for 
changes in the annual lottery. Currently, the worst team in the league can have 
no higher than the fourth pick in the draft. Stern believes there should be 
more study as the lottery goes to 11 teams.

Welsh soccer fans rampaged through a seaside suburb early Friday, fighting 
Greek fans and damaging three taverns before police arrested 14 of them, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor George Koliokostas charged the 14 fans of the Swansea City soccer 
club with causing damage to property and said they would remain in custody 
until their trial today before a three-member magistrates' court. 
</P>
<P>
The Welsh club lost, 3-2, to Panathinaikos of Athens in a European soccer 
championship match Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Welsh fans were arrested after going on a drunken rampage that authorities 
said caused $13,000 in damage to three taverns at the seaside suburb of 
Glyphada, 15 miles from Athens. 
</P>
<P>
They also damaged six parked cars and were involved in fights with Greek soccer 
fans before a squad of riot police arrested them.

FOX HOPING TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL RETURN; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER WORKING IN FRONT OFFICE, KING RIGHT WING EAGER FOR ICE TIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Fox hobbles out of the dressing room with huge ice bags taped to both 
knees, limiting him to the kind of stiff-legged gait that the Frankenstein 
monster made popular. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the monster, Fox is smiling his way through this camp d'entrainement 
as they say around here. 
</P>
<P>
The long year, the tough year, is behind him. The knees have been mended. It's 
going to be like old times. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what he's hoping for. It's up to him to make good use of every 
minute of ice time this fall to persuade the coaches that he can still do it. 
</P>
<P>
It's risky business sitting out a whole season. People tend to think you're 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
After undergoing arthroscopic surgery on both knees, Fox spent all of last 
season in the Kings' front office. Not just sitting there, but working. 
</P>
<P>
He'd show up every day in his suit and tie, carrying his leather appointment 
book. He would busy himself setting up appearances and luncheon speeches for 
the players, seeing that they showed up, seeing that they had all the materials 
they needed, then filing reports on how it went and how he thought the Kings' 
organization had benefited. 
</P>
<P>
Now, is that any way for a jock to act? That's how you launch a second career. 
Jocks on the injured list hang around the bench in sweat clothes, looking 
wistful and pathetic and saying how bored they are. 
</P>
<P>
So when, at the end of July, the Kings signed Larry Robinson and Fox came 
forward and voluntarily gave up his No. 19, there was some reason to think that 
he could give it up because he had no further need for it. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, how he cringed at those suggestions. And how he cringed when he was 
introduced as a "former King." And how he cringed when he even had to be 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
How soon they forget. 
</P>
<P>
Fox played for the Kings for eight seasons. In three of those seasons, he 
scored 30 goals. He still ranks fifth on the Kings' all-time scoring list with 
477 points on 185 goals and 292 assists. 
</P>
<P>
He was a pretty darned good right wing for a lot of years. Unfortunately for 
his fame factor, all those years pre-dated the trade for Wayne Gretzky, and a 
lot of L.A. fans hadn't yet tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
While on the speaking circuit, Fox could always get a laugh by asking if 
everyone noticed the marked improvement of the team during the 1988-'89 season, 
trying to take credit because "it was the year I sat out, that made a big 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Rodney Dangerfield approach is a twist for Fox, who is remembered in these 
parts as a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
Fox had been the 1979-80 player of the year and the leading scorer in the 
Ontario Junior Hockey Assn., playing with the Ottawa 67s. 
</P>
<P>
Fox was hailed in Hull as the hometown boy, seeing as how Ottawa is just across 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings drafted him out of Ottawa, made him a first-round draft selection 
after that season and signed him in August of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He came in with record numbers, a reputation as a "scoring machine," and with 
comparisons to King star Marcel Dionne, another small but productive scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Fox jumped right into NHL action, playing in 71 games his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
Even with his 1985-'86 season shortened to 39 games because of injury, he has 
averaged 71 games for his career. 
</P>
<P>
"After carrying the team for eight years, something was bound to go," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
His knees went. First one, then the other. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1987-'88, he started getting a sharp pain in his right knee and 
missed the last 10 games of the season. He had surgery to correct the arthritic 
condition, the wearing away inside the knee. He has had arthroscopic surgery 
twice on each knee to smooth out the surface and make them glide more easily. 
</P>
<P>
"My left knee is 100%, but it's the one that is more sore now," Fox said. "When 
I'm on the ice I feel good, and it doesn't feel like I'm favoring either leg, 
but the next morning, my left knee is more sore, so I guess I am putting more 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm on the ice, I feel 100%." 
</P>
<P>
If he can skate like that throughout the exhibition season, Fox could get back 
on the team in time to bask in some of the new-found glory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, mentally, to lose for eight years," Fox said. "All of a sudden, we 
make the acquisitions we need to make the team that much stronger, and I'm not 
there. I would like to have been part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working to get back into the NHL. You know the old song -- 'You don't know 
what you've got 'til it's gone? I used to think I wanted to play two more years 
in the NHL. Retire after 10 years. When you're out, and you're missing the game 
you say, 'hey, I want to play as long as I can.' " 
</P>
<P>
If only the knees hold up. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think my legs are fine," Fox said. "I've worked awfully hard on them. 
They just get a little bit achy at times. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that working 16 months in therapy wasn't a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>

AGASSI WITHDRAWS FROM L.A. EVENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Agassi withdrew from next week's Volvo/Los Angeles tournament Friday, 
citing a strained muscle in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
The sore leg caused the No. 5-ranked Agassi to default to Tim Wilkison in an 
exhibition at Amelia Island, Fla., in the second set of their match Wednesday 
night. Agassi, who reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open, said he hurt his 
leg in his quarterfinal match with Jimmy Connors. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi also said he aggravated the injury when he played Mats Wilander in an 
exhibition, Tuesday night at the new Assn. of Tennis Professionals headquarters 
in Ponte Vedra, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told several times that it's the sort of injury that only gets worse 
(with use)," Agassi said. "I don't want it to cost me four months of tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, 19, was a finalist in last year's Volvo/Los Angeles tournament, where 
he lost to Mikael Pernfors. He joins Johan Kriek (elbow), Dan Goldie (leg) and 
Jim Grabb (back) as withdrawals because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying for four spots in the $420,000 event is this weekend at the L.A. 
Tennis Center at UCLA. The Volvo/Los Angeles tournament, which awards $59,500 
to the winner, has a field that includes Mats Wilander, Michael Chang, Brad 
Gilbert, Tim Mayotte, Aaron Krickstein, Kevin Curren, Christo van Rensburg and 
Pernfors. THOMAS BONK

QINTEX WINS MGM/UA WITH A SWEETENED OFFER; 
</P>
<P>
MURDOCH GROUP BELIEVES IT WAS USED BY KERKORIAN TO SQUEEZE OUT HIGHER PRICE 
FROM RIVAL BIDDER

The price for MGM/UA Communications rose even higher Friday as controlling 
shareholder Kirk Kerkorian accepted a $1.5-billion purchase offer from 
Australia's Qintex Corp. over an 11th-hour bid from two firms controlled by 
media mogul Rupert Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was viewed on Wall Street and in the entertainment community as yet 
another financial magic trick by Kerkorian, who over the years has repeatedly 
sold and repurchased MGM/UA assets and now was profiting handsomely from a 
final bidding war. But the week's drama has sparked rancor between some of the 
players, with the Murdoch camp essentially accusing Kerkorian of soliciting the 
bid to jack up Qintex's price. 
</P>
<P>
The $25-per-share Qintex offer topped a $23.16-per-share bid made earlier this 
week by Murdoch and the $20-per-share price that Qintex had previously agreed 
to pay for MGM/UA. The latest Kerkorian agreement with Qintex seemingly ends an 
18-month auction for the studio and concludes Kerkorian's 20-year reign over 
MGM. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian was not available for comment, and his lawyer wouldn't say whether 
the financier had approached Murdoch or whether Murdoch had approached him 
about making a last-minute purchase offer. Regardless, several hard-bitten 
commentators in Hollywood and Wall Street concluded that Kerkorian had indeed 
come out on top. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirk has done it again. It's unbelievable. I don't know how he induced Rupert 
to come out of the woodwork and (prompt Qintex Chairman Christopher C.) Skase 
into paying $5 more a share," said one professional investor. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex, the owner of an Australian television network and resort properties, is 
best known in Hollywood as a television programming supplier that scored a big 
hit last season as co-producer of the miniseries "Lonesome Dove." 
</P>
<P>
Executives at several major studios questioned whether Qintex can raise the 
$1.5-billion purchase price, and then raise additional operating funds, since 
MGM/UA's activity has been stymied by the 18-month auction. In addition, Qintex 
is assuming $400 million in MGM/UA debt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if (Skase) knows how tough it is to be in this business and (to 
obtain) the $400 million or $500 million (needed) to get back in the movie 
business," declared one industry veteran. 
</P>
<P>
"This company will only earn about $75 million annually," warned another studio 
veteran who also estimated that MGM/UA will need $400 million in operating 
funds over the next 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Skase did not return a reporter's call, but David Evans, the Qintex executive 
who is slated to become president and chief executive of MGM/UA, said the 
company has no intention of selling assets to pay for its new purchase. Evans 
expressed confidence in the firm's ability to raise financing from European and 
Asian sources as well as its banks. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the week, the original Qintex deal appeared to be on track 
with its recent announcement of $400 million in bank financing and a closing 
date set for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weren't Ambushed 
</P>
<P>
Then came news of the Murdoch bid, which smacked of predatory behavior, even by 
Hollywood standards. The town buzzed because Murdoch had hosted a party to 
introduce the Qintex chairman to Hollywood bigwigs -- and then apparently tried 
to buy MGM/UA out from under his fellow Australian. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, however, Evans conceded that Qintex officials were not ambushed by 
Murdoch. Qintex was notified by MGM/UA several weeks ago that "interest was 
being expressed by News Corp. or Fox," Evans said. "Who solicited the bid, I 
simply don't know."

U.S. SUES EX-LINCOLN S&amp;L OPERATORS FOR $2.4 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators filed a civil lawsuit Friday in Phoenix charging that the 
former operators of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan devised a 
racketeering scheme to siphon $1.1 billion in federally insured deposits from 
the now-insolvent thrift for their own use. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, is the largest ever filed against 
directors and officers of failed institutions. With punitive damages and 
trebling provisions under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act, the government is seeking to recover up to $2.4 billion from 
the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts estimated that Lincoln's collapse will cost taxpayers up to 
$2.5 billion, which would make it the costliest S&amp;L failure in history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pattern of Deception' 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental 
Corp., and other executives bought the S&amp;L in 1984 and began "to divert . . 
. Lincoln's deposits and assets to themselves" through a wide range of 
"illegal, fraudulent and imprudent acts," including false and misleading 
statements to regulators, forgery and concealment of illegal cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
The racketeering scheme was devised to fuel the operation's "speculative" 
business ventures, from securities trading to real estate deals, the suit said. 
And to further the scheme, the suit claims, the defendants "engaged in a 
pattern of deception to mask prohibited and sham transactions from regulatory 
scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
The suit also seeks to freeze the assets of Keating, who is a multimillionaire, 
and others, allowing each to live on $3,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Keating was out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Phoenix-based American Continental called the racketeering charges 
"mean-spirited" on the part of regulators and denied that Keating and the other 
36 defendants were liable for any of the 14 claims made in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized in April 
</P>
<P>
"There are no surprises here," said Melvin A. McDonald, a lawyer for the 
company, about the allegations. "This is the same old wine in the same old 
bottles -- the same information regulators have had for years. They're just 
trying to put new labels on the bottles." 
</P>
<P>
The suit stemmed from an in-depth investigation by regulators, said Alan 
Whitney, spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures 
deposits at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental filed 
for bankruptcy. Regulators declared the S&amp;L insolvent on Aug. 2 and put it 
in receivership. The suit is the first major legal action brought by the 
Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created last month by a new federal law to 
handle failed banks and thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges four RICO violations and three violations of Arizona's 
racketeering laws against Keating and six executives, including his son and two 
sons-in-law. An additional seven allegations accuse the defendants -- 20 
individuals and 17 companies -- of fraud, conspiracy, negligence and violations 
of regulatory laws. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants include William J. Keating, a former congressman and former 
publisher of the Cincinnati Enquirer. He is Charles Keating's brother. Their 
spouses and those of several other defendants were also named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Defendants 
</P>
<P>
Keating and the other defendants are accused of wrongdoing in transactions 
involving high-yield corporate securities known as junk bonds, corporate stock 
bought by American Continental's employee stock ownership plan, land sold to 
related parties allegedly for above-market prices and straw borrowers and straw 
purchasers allegedly used to avoid direct investment regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also claims that American Continental wrongly appropriated money from 
Lincoln to pay corporate taxes, resulting in a $125-million loss of income to 
the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the alleged wrongdoing, the suit said, was the result of Keating's 
effort to get around federal regulations that limited the amount of money that 
Lincoln could use to invest in such things as real estate and securities. 
</P>
<P>
In one example cited in the suit, Keating and others sold a residential 
development to R.A. Homes in Phoenix. The transaction was financed through 
Lincoln, and Keating entities maintained control over the development. R.A. 
Homes is operated by Ron Ober, who has been campaign manager for Sen. Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cheap Sale Alleged 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that the defendants manipulated a number of stock 
transactions that will result in more than $22 million in damages to Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In one transaction, the defendants allegedly caused Lincoln to sell stock in 
Memorex International to a third party for $1 million -- after the investment 
banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert sent a letter saying the stock was worth 
$2.8 million. The third party soon sold the stock to American Continental for 
$2 million, and the company later sold the stock at its market value -- $13.3 
million. The suit claims the company misappropriated $11.3 million in profits 
that should have gone to Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
And the defendants also tried to avoid regulations limiting loans to insiders, 
the suit said. The primary example involved funds that Lincoln made available 
to Southmark Corp. in Dallas and its subsidiaries and about $35 million in 
loans that Southmark's thrift subsidiary, San Jacinto Savings &amp; Loan Assn., 
made to a Keating-led partnership that owns the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was angered that the suit named the spouses of some American 
Continental executives as defendants. Though not named as racketeering 
defendants, he said, the spouses named in the suit suffer the same "powerful" 
stigma that attaches to other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Several sources said regulators had been debating internally for a month about 
whether to bring racketeering claims and seek to recover of damages from 
Keating's assets or sue only for fraud and work out a more certain settlement 
with the insurance carrier covering director and officer liability.

WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX DECLINE MASKS INFLATION OF 6% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wholesale prices fell for the third consecutive month in August, the government 
reported Friday, but economists noted that plummeting energy prices masked a 
continuation of moderate inflation for most wholesale goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said its producer price index dipped 0.4% last month, 
following an identical drop in July and a 0.1% decline in June. The index of 
wholesale prices is considered a good indication of where consumer prices are 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
The August decline was attributable in large part to a 7.3% plunge in energy 
prices, which have fallen for several months after a sharp run-up in the 
spring. Food prices, another volatile component of the index, increased 0.3% in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding energy and food, producer prices rose 0.5%, indicating that the 
"core" rate of wholesale inflation is running at an annual rate of more than 
6%. For that reason, economists were somewhat less than ecstatic about the 
August figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Inflationary Psychology' 
</P>
<P>
"This looks better on the surface than in detail, because inflation at more 
than 6% is no bargain," said Donald Straszheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch 
in New York. "The key here was the decline in gasoline, but energy prices have 
now turned around again. We could get a hike in gasoline next month." 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts echoed Straszheim's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"With core inflation at a 6% rate, we're getting close to the point where 
consumers and producers alike begin to fall into an inflationary psychology, 
where a fair amount of inflation is expected," said Dirk Van Dongen, president 
of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors in Washington. "We've had core 
increases for three of the past five months, so we can't simply declare victory 
and hang it up on inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State 
University in Atlanta, said, "This was probably the last PPI drop for a while. 
And energy has probably done its last hurrah for now." 
</P>
<P>
Ratajczak noted that of about three dozen categories of finished goods, 
excluding food products, only five declined in August. Of those, three were 
energy products: gasoline, natural gas and fuel oil. The other two were 
household glassware and costume jewelry, hardly major factors in the nation's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weakness Feared 
</P>
<P>
Since energy prices are expected to rebound in the months ahead and other 
wholesale products are unlikely to decline significantly, Ratajczak said he 
expects wholesale prices to increase in September, with consumer prices soon to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, analysts said the likely uptick in prices will not signal another 
inflation scare such as the one earlier this year because the economy is 
growing too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York, 
said that he is concerned that the economy is weaker than many analysts think. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen the PPI down three months in a row and the last time that happened 
the economy declined," Kellner said. The previous three-month decline was 
January through April of 1986. The economy subsequently declined at an annual 
rate of 1.8% in the second quarter of that year. 
</P>
<P>
Kellner noted that while the volatile ups and downs of energy prices often are 
discounted, they exert a "ripple effect" throughout the economy. "In fact," he 
said, "it was a collapse in energy prices that killed the economy in the 
Southwest in 1986 and caused that near-recession." 
</P>
<P>
But few economists, including Kellner, expect an outright recession now. 
Straszheim reflected the apparent consensus in predicting relatively sluggish 
economic growth of about 2% and manageable inflation of about 5% for the next 
year or two. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason for people to celebrate about this report," Straszheim said. 
"But no reason to panic, either." 
</P>
<P>
With August's figures included, inflation as measured by the producer price 
index has settled down to a manageable 4.4% annual rate for the year so far.

JULY BUSINESS INVENTORIES INCREASE 0.6%; SALES FALL 0.9%

<P>
Business inventories climbed 0.6% in July, the biggest gain in three months, 
while total business sales fell by 0.9%, the Commerce Department reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
While the combination of falling sales and rising inventories would normally 
spark recession fears, analysts for the most part dismissed the report. 
</P>
<P>
"The rise in business inventories is potentially a problem, but when it is 
taken in context with other data, it is not very worrisome," said Allen Sinai, 
chief economist of Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting this view, the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, reported that industrial 
production posted a 0.3% increase in August, the best showing in four months, 
reflecting a rebound in production at auto plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moderate Gains Expected 
</P>
<P>
Economists said this increase in industrial output, along with a rise in retail 
sales in August, was an encouraging sign that factories would not scale back 
production plans for fear that output was getting ahead of demand. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that outside the auto industry, inventories have been 
kept at fairly lean levels, and they predict that overall production will post 
moderate gains for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
For July, the 0.6% rise in inventories, the largest since a 0.9% May increase, 
pushed the total stockpile of unsold goods to a seasonally adjusted $785.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
It was led by a 1.1% rise in inventories held by manufacturers. Inventories at 
the retail level rose 0.3%, while wholesale inventories were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.9% plunge in total sales matched a similar decline in February and was 
the largest sales setback since a 3% drop in January, 1987. The July decrease 
left total sales at a seasonally adjusted level of $511.09 billion 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retail Sales Strong 
</P>
<P>
Sales at the manufacturing level fell by 1.8% while sales by wholesalers were 
off 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales were the only area of strength, rising 0.5% in July. In an 
indication of further improvement, the government said Thursday that retail 
sales in August were up 0.7%, reflecting a surge in auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of falling sales and rising inventories pushed the ratio of 
inventories to sales to 1.54 in July, meaning that it would take 1.54 months to 
exhaust inventories at the July sales pace. 
</P>
<P>
August's production rate represented an increase over revised figures showing 
increases of 0.1% in July and 0.2% in June. Production was flat in May, after 
rising 0.7% in April. (The Fed originally reported that production rose 0.2% in 
July after falling 0.1% in both May and June.) 
</P>
<P>
The Fed credited almost all the August growth to a rebound in auto factories 
and coal miners returning to work after a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"Excluding motor vehicles, output of both consumer goods and business equipment 
was sluggish during the summer," it said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Fed said the operating rate of factories, mines and 
utilities remained unchanged at 83.8% of capacity in August. The operating rate 
measures not only output but also changes in productivity levels. 
</P>
<P>
Factory use had declined 0.1 percentage point in June, the Fed report said, 
after reaching a 10-year high of 84.3% in December, 1988, and last January. 
Last month's operating rate also was unchanged from August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operating Rate Up 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said its industrial production index in August stood at 142.4% of its 
1977 base, up from 142% in July. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the operating rate rose 0.1 percentage point to 84% at 
manufacturing plants. The rate had peaked at 84.7% in January. 
</P>
<P>
The rate at factories producing durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to 
last more than three years -- rose 0.2 percentage point to 82.6%. The rate at 
factories producing non-durable goods fell to 86.1% in August from 86.4% in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
"Unchanged capacity utilization in August signals the likelihood that 
inflationary pressures have declined substantially in the last several months," 
William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
said.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: REMARRYING AFTER A TAX-AVOIDING SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Can you handle one last question on the $125,000 profit exemption 
allowed senior citizens when selling a home? You have already said that if a 
couple divorces but continues to live in their home, each spouse is entitled to 
claim, upon sale of the house, the full $125,000 exemption, instead of sharing 
the single $125,000 exemption that they would be entitled to if they were still 
married. What I am wondering is: How long after the sale could the couple 
remarry? -- E. S. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The Internal Revenue Code does not address the strategy you suggest. 
But the law, as it is currently written, does permit each divorced spouse to 
claim a full $125,000 profit exemption, allowing them to shelter a total of 
$250,000 in property appreciation. The only requirements are that both sellers 
be at least 55 years old and have lived in the house for three of the last five 
years. (In the case of a married couple, only one spouse must be 55 or older.) 
</P>
<P>
When can this loving, but profit-sheltering, couple remarry? For starters, they 
wouldn't want to do it in the same year they were divorced, because that would 
nullify the whole strategy. And they probably wouldn't want to remarry too soon 
after divorcing because the IRS does pay attention to such ploys. 
</P>
<P>
Our experts recommend, if your heart is absolutely set on this strategy, that 
you wait a decent interval -- three to five years -- before tying the knot 
again. They further suggest that you be extremely careful when offering your 
reasons for remarrying. Something like "it's better the second time around," is 
probably the safest explanation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Property Sale as Installment Deal 
</P>
<P>
Q: I sold my rental property this year and was paid 50% of the sales price when 
escrow closed and took back a note for the remaining half. The note will be 
repaid in five years. Am I allowed to report this transaction as an installment 
sale on my state and federal income tax returns, and, if so, will I be charged 
interest on the amount of the note? -- J. G. 
</P>
<P>
A: With one possible exception, you are free to report the transaction as an 
installment sale. The only potential roadblock would arise if you took an 
accelerated depreciation on the property. In that, case you would have more 
gain to recognize -- and pay taxes on -- than otherwise. If this is your 
situation, you should consult your accountant or tax attorney. If you 
depreciated the property in the usual way, you may report half of your gain 
this year and half when the note is repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the sale price of the property was more than $5 million, the IRS will 
not require you to pay interest on the second half of the gain you will 
recognize in five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Get the Most Out of Social Security 
</P>
<P>
Q: All your recent discussion about Social Security benefits got me to 
thinking. Can my wife retire at age 62 on her own small Social Security and 
then, at age 65, switch over to the higher benefits as my spouse? -- C. S. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. At age 65, your wife is entitled to spousal benefits equal to 50% of 
your benefits, regardless of the amount she would be entitled to on her own 
account and regardless of the fact that she started taking her own benefits at 
age 62. However, if your wife decided to enroll for spousal benefits at age 62, 
she would receive 20% less than she would get if she waited until she was 65. 
By taking benefits on her own account at age 62, she preserves her right to 
receive full benefits as your spouse at age 65. 
</P>
<P>
It's OK to Transfer Your IRA Account 
</P>
<P>
Q: When I retired, I rolled over my pension distribution into an individual 
retirement account, and over the years, the value of the account has grown to 
significantly more than $100,000. I am aware that the amount in excess of 
$100,000 has no federal insurance protection, so I would like to put this 
excess into another IRA at a different institution where I would be entitled to 
the insurance coverage. My accountant has expressed concern that the IRS might 
view this move as a distribution of the account and subject it to income taxes. 
My accountant isn't sure, and I can't seem to get a straight answer from the 
IRS. -- J. C. H. 
</P>
<P>
A: You have nothing to worry about. The IRS allows you to transfer funds from 
one IRA to another without paying taxes. You can make this transfer in one of 
two ways: 
</P>
<P>
You may ask the institution holding your account, your trustee, to make the 
transfer to another institution of your choice. This is called a "trustee to 
trustee" transfer, and you are allowed to make as many of these transfers as 
you want without any tax penalty, so long as you do not withdraw any of the 
funds for your own use. 
</P>
<P>
You also may withdraw any amount from your IRA and redeposit it in another IRA 
within 60 days without facing a tax penalty. This is called a roll-over, and 
you are allowed one such transaction a year without tax penalty. What you do 
with the money during the 60 days is your business, and if you redeposit the 
money within the allotted time, no questions are asked and no tax is assessed.

Although it is risky, some people have been known to tap their IRAs to get 
themselves over a temporary cash crunch. This strategy can work if you are 
virtually 100% certain that you can redeposit the full amount within the 60 
days. However, if you miss the deadline, even by one day, you will have to pay 
income taxes, and perhaps an early withdrawal penalty, on the account's 
proceeds.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: JUNK BOND SUBSTITUTES THAT OFFER GOOD YIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If this week's selloff of high-yield junk bonds has you scared of junk bond 
mutual funds, you're not alone. Investor withdrawals, which picked up in July 
and August, have accelerated in recent days amid sharp price declines in issues 
of Campeau Corp. and other troubled firms and urgings by some investment 
experts to avoid these funds. 
</P>
<P>
Fund groups such as Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and others are reporting a surge in 
outflows this week, with much of the cash going into money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
Are there other alternatives? Unfortunately, there are not many other types of 
mutual funds that offer the 10% to 15% yields of many junk bond funds. There 
are, however, several other types of funds that provide reasonably decent 
yields or the potential for capital gains along with yields. 
</P>
<P>
And don't write off all junk bond funds because they are not all the same. Some 
invest in higher-quality issues that are not considered as risky as others. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at junk bond funds and some alternatives: 
</P>
<P>
* Junk bond funds. Some funds have been reducing their risk in recent months by 
sticking to the safest and most salable issues. They also have been raising 
cash levels to meet possible investor withdrawals without resorting to panic 
selling. Others, however, continue to favor riskier issues to prop up their 
yields. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Lucas, an analyst at Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago publisher of fund 
information, lists several conservative junk funds. They include Eaton Vance 
Corporate High Income, Kemper High Yield, T. Rowe Price High Yield, Putnam High 
Yield and Cigna High Yield. On the other hand, funds that have sought high 
yields at the expense of safety include Alliance High-Yield, Venture Income 
Plus, American Capital High-Yield, Keystone Custodian B-4 Series and Bull &amp; 
Bear High Yield, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the risk exists that a massive panic such as this week's could lead to a 
selloff of even the safest issues, hurting conservative funds, analysts 
caution. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a liquid market," says William E. Donoghue, publisher of 
Donoghue's Moneyletter, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter. In a panic, "there may 
not be a buyer at a fair price out there. The last person out will get a whole 
lot less than the first person out." 
</P>
<P>
* High-grade corporate bond funds. These invest in blue chip corporate bonds, 
far safer than junk bonds. But they don't yield as much either, now paying 
about 1 percentage point above Treasury issues of comparable maturities, 
compared to premiums of close to 6 percentage points for junk bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
And high-grade corporates are not entirely risk free. They can lose value 
through so-called event risk, when the issuing corporation takes on greater 
debt through a takeover, leveraged buyout, restructuring or other transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based advisory service 
that publishes Mutual Fund Values, suggests Boston Co. Managed Income and 
Strong Income as high-grade corporate bond funds with strong track records. 
</P>
<P>
* Government bond funds. These usually invest in safe Treasury securities, so 
the bonds are free from default risk. But funds investing in long-term bonds of 
say, 10 years or longer in maturity, are not free from fluctuations in value. 
That is because when interest rates rise, as they have in the past two months, 
prices of long-term bonds fall. 
</P>
<P>
Another drawback on long-term bonds: Their yields now are not that much greater 
than on shorter-term bonds. Thirty-year Treasury bonds, for example, are 
yielding about 8.10%, compared to about 8% for six-month or one-year Treasury 
bills. So unless you are convinced interest rates are heading downward in the 
coming months, most experts advise sticking to short- or intermediate-term 
government bond funds for now. But if you think interest rates are heading 
south, long-term bond funds can be very profitable because their prices rise 
when rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
* Ginnie Mae funds. These funds, which invest in securities of the Government 
National Mortgage Assn. that are backed by mortgages of ordinary homeowners, 
are a good choice for conservative investors, many advisers say. Their yields 
are about 0.5 to 1 percentage point higher than Treasuries, and they are less 
volatile, not rising as much as Treasuries when interest rates fall but not 
falling as much when interest rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
"In a flat or down market, you'll be fine," Mansueto says of Ginnie Maes. 
"These are good for those who don't know where (interest rates) are going as a 
way to hedge their bets." 
</P>
<P>
Among Ginnie Mae funds, Mansueto suggests Benham GNMA Income, Vanguard GNMA 
Portfolio, Fidelity Mortgage Securities Portfolio and Fidelity Ginnie Mae 
Portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
* High-yielding stock funds. Some analysts argue that junk bond funds are 
really more like stock funds than bond funds because prices of junk bonds -- 
like stocks -- rise or fall according to the financial fortunes of their 
corporate issuers. Therefore, you might consider mutual funds investing in 
utility stocks or other issues that stress high income along with modest 
potential for price appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Fund analyst Mansueto suggests Dodge &amp; Cox Balanced Fund, Fidelity Puritan, 
Founders Equity Income, Lindner Dividend, Mutual Qualified, T. Rowe Price 
Equity Income or Wellington Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Among utility funds, he suggests Fidelity Select-Telecommunications, 
Prudential-Bache Utility Fund or Fidelity Select-Utilities. 
</P>
<P>
* Money market funds. If this week's junk bond rout has you scared of anything 
even remotely risky, stick to money market funds. At Fidelity Investments, the 
nation's largest mutual fund group, most investors moving out of its junk bond 
fund in the past two days have gone into money funds, reports Neal Litvack, 
vice president of marketing. These funds are virtually as safe as bank 
certificates of deposit or Treasury bills because they invest in them. 
</P>
<P>
Several money funds, including Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, Fidelity Spartan and 
Vanguard Money Market Reserves-Prime, are paying annualized compounded yields 
at or above 9%.

DOW RISES 9.69; RUMORS ROCK OTHER MARKETS

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market turned in a mixed showing Friday, exhibiting few ill effects 
from the quarterly "triple witching hour." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 9.69 to 2,674.58, reducing its loss 
for the week to 34.96. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume soared to 234.87 million shares from 149.27 million Thursday, 
and it was the heaviest total since 244.51 million changed hands at the last 
witching hour on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances, however, by about 5 to 4 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 651 up, 837 down and 505 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy activity at the opening and again at the close was prompted by the 
witching hour, involving the last trading in a group of expiring options and 
futures on stock indexes. 
</P>
<P>
There had been concern that professional traders engaged in multiple strategies 
involving those contracts would depress the market with a barrage of sell 
orders for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
But the market got a boost from the latest data on the producer price index and 
the trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Shares prices fell sharply in relatively active trading on London's Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, closed down 15.5 at 
2,366.5, its lowest close since it finished at 2,360.0 on Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell sharply in panicky domestic dealings characterized by wild 
rumors and price swings, erasing gains posted in earlier foreign trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current 
delivery jumped to $363.90 an ounce, up $3.40. Republic National Bank's late 
quote was $362.50, up from $359.35. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rallied sharply in foreign trading, climbing above the benchmark 
2.00 level against the West German mark after a better-than-expected report on 
the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But traders at home said the euphoria was short-lived. By mid-afternoon, the 
market was hit with a string of outrageous rumors ranging from the 
assassination of President Bush to the failure of Wells Fargo &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen was not traded in Tokyo, where markets were closed for a 
holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 148.65 yen, compared to Thursday's 
close in Tokyo of 145.85 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 146.35 yen, 
down from 146.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $356.25 an ounce, compared to late 
Thursday's $362. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold fell to $356 from $361.75 late 
Thursday. Hong Kong's gold market was closed Friday for the Chinese mid-autumn 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices gyrated before finishing higher in a session dominated by mixed 
economic news and rumors. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up in early trading, down slightly at 
midday and back up by the close. It finished 15/32 point higher, or nearly 
$4.70 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield fell to 8.07% from 8.12% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.6125%, up from 8.875% late Thursday.

<P>
NEWPORT HARBOR COMBINES TRADITIONAL SUMMER EVENTS FOR A BIG 10-DAY CELEBRATION 
OF THE COMMUNITY'S NAUTICAL CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If it looks as if the water level in Newport Harbor is a little high for the 
next few days, don't be too quick to blame it on the tide. It could be the 
effects of SeaFest. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of antique and classic wooden boats, tall ships, electric boats, wind 
surfers, sailboats, runabouts, yachts and one 522-foot Navy vessel do, after 
all, displace a lot of water. 
</P>
<P>
They also are expected to attract more than 50,000 boat buffs and other salty 
types to the harbor and its environs for the first 10-day celebration of its 
kind in Newport Beach history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Juggling the Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Newport SeaFest, which began Friday and ends Sept. 24,, is the first 
consolidation of several traditional Newport Beach summertime nautical events 
with a handful of new festivities designed to highlight the waterborne nature 
of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It all started with suggestions from a couple of (Newport Harbor Area Chamber 
of Commerce) members who were sitting around talking about how we could pull 
together a big community-wide event with the cooperation of service groups and 
agencies as well as the chamber," said Richard Luehrs, president of the Chamber 
of Commerce, the sponsor of SeaFest. 
</P>
<P>
"This was coupled with questions about why we couldn't do some of the things 
later in the year that we normally do in the middle of summer, like the 
Character Boat Parade and the Wooden Boat Festival. In mid-summer, there's so 
much traffic and congestion down here. We thought if these things were 
scheduled later, it'd be a little less hectic on people." 
</P>
<P>
So they did, and in the bargain added new events such as the Taste of Newport 
(which features live music and samples of food from 40 area restaurants), a 
fishing tournament and kite contest -- and the SeaFest Marine Art Festival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seamanship and Silliness 
</P>
<P>
The centerpieces of the festival are the traditional boating events, which show 
off seamanship, precise marine architecture, creativity and, in one case, plain 
silliness. 
</P>
<P>
The first of these is today's third annual Great Electric Boat Race, in which 
more than 40 electrically powered boats will compete in a rally around the 
harbor and in a "Rhine Channel Drag Race." The rally will begin at the Cannery 
restaurant (3010 Lafayette Ave.) at 11:30 a.m., where each skipper will be 
given a set of clues to solve which will lead to points around the bay, where 
the skippers will collect tokens. The final "drag race" will be held at the 
Cannery following the rally. 
</P>
<P>
The first visit to the Newport Harbor area of a Navy vessel in more than 25 
years will take place today and Sunday. The 522-foot-long U.S. amphibious dock 
landing ship Fort McHenry will be anchored off the Newport Harbor jetty for the 
weekend and will offer free tours. The Chamber of Commerce will offer 
transportation to the ship both days for $5. Transport tickets, good for a bus 
trip from Newport Center to the Harbor Master's dock and a launch from there to 
the ship, are available in advance only from the Chamber of Commerce offices 
(1470 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach), the Balboa Pavilion (400 Main St., Balboa) 
and the Meridien Hotel (4500 MacArthur Blvd., Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Next weekend will see the arrival of several old-timers and a few very 
old-timers as part of the Tall Ships Festival and the Wooden Boat Festival, 
both of which will take place at the Boy Scouts Seabase at 1931 W. Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Next Saturday, the tall ships "Pilgrim," "Resolution," "Argus" and others will 
be tied up at the Boy Scouts Seabase and will be open to boarding and tours for 
$3 (children 12 and under free). They are scheduled to sail into the harbor 
about 5 p.m. the day before, along with other classic and antique boats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wooden Boats on Display 
</P>
<P>
The same day, the third annual Wooden Boat Festival begins with a display at 
the Boy Scouts Seabase of more than 60 classic wooden craft, from sailboats to 
motorized runabouts. All boats are available for inspection for $3 (children 12 
and under free). 
</P>
<P>
Events during the day will include a wooden-boat sailing regatta (noon), a 
boat-building contest for children and adults (11 a.m.), and wooden-boat 
cruises (ongoing). 
</P>
<P>
Several of the wooden boats scheduled to be on display are owned by members of 
the Antique and Classic Boat Society, an international organization of wooden- 
boat fanciers. Roger Huebner of Newport Beach, the president of the Southern 
California chapter of the society, said that he would be sailing his own 1939 
Chris Craft runabout. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these old boats have their history right here in Newport Beach," 
Huebner said. "There's real enjoyment in seeing something that's old but looks 
new and is fully functional. People look at these boats and say, 'Where did you 
get that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Steele, chairman of the Wooden Boat Festival, said: "Some of these 
runabouts are worth about $150,000, and they're only 20 feet long. We're 
probably going to have about $7 million or $8 million worth of boats out there. 
Everybody's been spending the last few months sprucing their boats up. The 
owners have really gotten into this. There's so much pride in these boats, and 
love for them, that the owners won't put them in the show unless they're in 
great shape." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boat Owners Play Dress-Up 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 24, the final day of the festival, the zaniest of the events, the 
Character Boat Parade, sets sail. "Newport Harbor in the Roaring '20s" is the 
theme of the 29th annual bay cruise in which local boat owners decorate their 
boats in often outlandish ways. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will follow a new route, beginning at the Lido Marina turning basin 
at 1 p.m., continuing through the harbor and ending at the starting point (tall 
ships will sail with the parade for part of the route). The boats will be 
judged on best decorations, best sound, best animation, best costumes and best 
interpretation of the parade theme. There also is a "Dirty Old Manifold" award 
for the oldest boat. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the parade was hatched by local cartoonists Virgil Partch and Dick 
Shaw, who inaugurated it by sailing their 24-foot tug "Michigan" around the 
harbor with a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Partch and Shaw were Disney cartoonists at the time, and they painted the boat 
to look like Little Toot," said Jim Dale, a local restaurateur whose family now 
owns the "Michigan" and sails it each year in the Character Boat Parade. "They 
said, 'Let's do something for fun and get all the people with boats out there 
who want to get a little crazy and have a good time and all end up at a bar 
after the parade's over.' Now that the Commodore's Club of the Chamber of 
Commerce has taken it over, it's become real organized, but it's still a lot of 
fun. Our family likes to take the boat out and kind of wave the flag a little 
bit." 
</P>

As vice president of costuming for Disney's theme parks and resorts, Bob Phelps 
helps a lot of people get dressed every morning. Five thousand employees at 
Disneyland in California and more than 15,000 employees in Florida's Walt 
Disney World wear a complete suit of clothing ("We provide everything but the 
underwear") designed, manufactured and regularly laundered by Phelps and his 
bicoastal staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Our apparel operation has got to be Disney's best-kept secret," Phelps muses. 
"Look at us -- we have an inventory of 3 million wardrobe pieces for 
restaurants, hotels, security, retail -- everything you can imagine. And yet, 
to the clothing industry, we're virtually unknown." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Completes the Settings 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the operation's low profile may be the strongest indicator of 
Phelps' success. Disneyland costume designer Tom Pierce explains: "Our parks 
offer highly themed settings: a turn-of-the- century Main Street, a subtropical 
jungle, and so on. The clothing worn by cast members (Disney's vernacular for 
its theme-park employees) complements the setting. In fact, if we're doing our 
jobs correctly, the costume almost disappears into the scenery." 
</P>
<P>
While visitors to the Disney parks may not always see what employees are 
wearing, the themed apparel still contributes to their experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to give a bit of theatrical flair to almost everything we create," 
Pierce says. "That way, every contact a visitor has with a cast member has a 
built-in element of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Although the costumes may communicate a subtle message to park guests, their 
effect on employees is unmistakable. As Phelps explains it: "Take a 19-year-old 
guy and put him into our steamboat pilot costume. It's very detailed to the 
period and the role: a navy blue vest and jacket, lots of brass buttons, a 
visored cap. He can't put it on without also putting on the mantle of authority 
and responsibility that go with it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Than Employee' 
</P>
<P>
Phelps and his staff call their product costumes; the word uniforms is not in 
their vocabulary. He adds: "We also refer to all public areas of the parks as 
'on-stage.' When you go on-stage, you're more than an employee -- you're a 
performer." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Disney, designer Sandra Huber pursued a stage career, creating 
costumes for Southern California's top theaters. Although she now may be called 
upon to outfit waiters and tour guides, they receive the same design 
consideration she once reserved for Broadway stars. 
</P>
<P>
Huber says: "We first ask ourselves, 'What story are we telling in this area of 
the park? What are we trying to communicate to our guests?' " 
</P>
<P>
Disney's costumers, feeling that the fabrics commonly used in creating career 
apparel offer too limited a design palette, frequently send a staff of buyers 
on cross-country searches for just the right colors, patterns and weaves. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm designing clothing for sales clerks who will work in a shop 
themed to Los Angeles in the 1940s," Huber mentions. "The women will wear plain 
cotton-print dresses, World War II vintage, nothing very fancy. Believe it or 
not, we just couldn't find fabric that looked or felt authentic -- until our 
buyers discovered a small firm in the Midwest that markets to rural 
communities, where styles change very slowly. Sometimes the simplest designs 
require the most effort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trial Wearings 
</P>
<P>
As soon as a new costume comes off the drawing boards, several prototypes are 
assembled and are then wear-tested by the people who will be performing their 
jobs in them. The designers receive detailed reports on the garment's fit, 
appearance, comfort, possible safety problems, adequacy of pockets and dozens 
of other details. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Haynes, who directs the operation of the department, says that a negative 
report from the field "can send the costume back to Square 1 -- extensive 
redesign. As an in-house supplier, we can't just take the money and run. We 
live with our accomplishments -- and our failures -- every day. That's how you 
really learn." 
</P>
<P>
A green light from the garments' users does not necessarily mean a costume is 
ready for production. First, it will undergo testing at Walt Disney World, 
where the hot tropical sun and humidity (and, inevitably, perspiration) create 
the ultimate durability test for clothing. While there, the garment is sent 
through industrial laundry and dry-cleaning equipment at least 25 times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Durability Test 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the fashion industry requires its clothing to retain its appearance 
after five launderings," Haynes explains. "If a garment can keep its looks 
after 12, it is considered indestructible. We expect our costumes to look great 
after more than 100 cleanings." 
</P>
<P>
A typical day's work for a Disney costumer is anything but typical; the parks 
might need a tuxedo for Mickey Mouse . . . or a 15-foot-long spangled cape for 
a circus elephant . . . or an eye patch for a robotic pirate. The costumers 
have been asked to re-create famous costumes from the past, including Judy 
Garland's gingham dress and ruby red slippers from "The Wizard of Oz" and 
Bogart's famous trench coat and fedora worn in "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, outside Disney, the designers remain unknown. Phelps comments: "We've 
been approached a few times by other corporations who would like to give their 
people -- the employees who have contact with the public -- a little bit of the 
Disney flair. It always surprises us, because we really don't promote 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Phelps and his staff may not linger in anonymity for too much longer. 
One day the world may discover -- in the case of Disney -- clothes really do 
make the mouse.

WALLYBALL: WHOLE NEW BALLGAME; 
</P>
<P>
ENTHUSIASTS GO TO THE WALL TO ADD SPIN FOR HYBRID SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not quite volleyball, and it's certainly not racquetball. But it's 
something like volleyball, and it's played on a racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like playing volleyball in your bedroom," said one convert to the new 
hybrid sport called wallyball. That's the feeling wallyball players get when 
the walls seem to close in on them. 
</P>
<P>
Use a slightly smaller, softer, rubber-textured wallyball, string an 
8-foot-high net across a racquetball court and you have the makings of 
wallyball. 
</P>
<P>
It's the walls that give wallyball its name, its character and its fun. The 
walls put a spin on the sport of volleyball that "humbles the best of 
(volleyball) players," says Pete Martinez, recreation director at the Thousand 
Oaks Community Center. The wallyball caroms off walls, intentionally or not, at 
weird and unpredictable angles, creating ample opportunity for farce among 
inexperienced players. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requires Finesse 
</P>
<P>
"The big bashers who come into wallyball from volleyball find out wallyball 
requires more finesse," says Martinez. Rules allow hitting the ball off one 
wall per hit; if it hits two walls or if it hits the opponent's back wall at 
all, a point goes to the other team. Hence, any similarity to the wall-bashing 
sport of racquetball diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
Wallyball can be played with teams of two, three or four. The game proceeds 
much like volleyball. After the serve across the net, the opposing team can hit 
the ball as many as three times. Any or none of the hits can be off a wall. 
Smart players set the ball up to one another, culminating in a "kill," or final 
hit, that the team with the ball hopes will be unreturnable. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the kill can be quite different in wallyball than volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walls Come Into Play 
</P>
<P>
Again, the walls form the crux of the game. A wallyball kill might be a 
downward smash off a wall. It might also be a "dink" off a wall, designed to 
nick the wall and die before it can be dug out by an opponent. Clever players 
will add a bit of spin to the ball, just to confuse the issue. 
</P>
<P>
And wallyball can get confusing. Or at least confounding. "If you want to look 
really foolish, play wallyball," one Thousand Oaks player says. Martinez, who 
has been playing wallyball for five years and organized a Friday night league 
in Thousand Oaks, says he's never seen a game in which a player didn't catch a 
wallyball in the face or head at least once, the result of misjudging a carom. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost always hear laughter on the court," Martinez says. "It tends to be 
a more casual game than league volleyball or basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Wallyball is the creation of Joe Garcia, who in 1979 was managing a racquetball 
facility in Calabasas and looking for a way to fill up empty court time. He set 
about trying to devise new games that could be played on a racquetball court. 
One day Garcia and some workmen played around with a volleyball on an empty 
racquetball court, and Garcia realized he was onto something. He also realized 
that his volleyball-with-walls would be like a pinball game unless he limited 
the number of walls the ball could strike. He also had to limit the number of 
players on the smaller court. 
</P>
<P>
Refinements ensued, and by the end of 1979, Garcia formalized the rules, 
registered the name and started Wallyball Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Sports companies like Voit and Mizuno began making official blue wallyballs, 
and racquetball court managers, like Garcia, found they could fill otherwise 
dead time. 
</P>
<P>
The game has a small but growing number of participants nationwide. President 
Bush reportedly has taken a fancy to the game and plays for relaxation at Camp 
David. Many racquetball courts in Southern California make at least one court 
available for wallyball. 
</P>
<P>
A hotbed for wallyball is Holiday Harbor Racquetball Club in Marina del Rey, 
where half the courts are outfitted for wallyball. A footwear store in the 
Marina has organized a Wednesday night league at Holiday Harbor. The league 
season began Wednesday and runs through Nov. 15. Friday night is drop-in 
wallyball night at Holiday Harbor, when players can get involved in informal 
play. 
</P>
<P>
According to league co-manager Dan Brown, the Wednesday night games can be very 
competitive. "We have some beach pros and former collegiate players in the A 
division; these folks take the game pretty seriously," Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
However, B and C divisions provide places for players of less ability. The 
Holiday Harbor league is composed of 24 three-person, co-ed teams. Teams of 
four play in the Thousand Oaks Friday night league. 
</P>
<P>
For information on the Starting Line league, call (213) 827-3035. For 
information on the Thousand Oaks league, call (805) 492-2461. Or contact your 
local racquetball court or community center.

Father Eleutherius Winance is the first to admit his garden is "a little 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the dry, high desert, midway between Littlerock and Big Pines, 
where temperatures in the summer normally stay in the high 90s every day, his 
quiet, cool, green haven on a few sloping acres is a thriving anomaly, often 
ill-kept, he says, and even contains some items "stolen" from the church. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the assortment of flowers and a dozen varieties of trees provide one of 
several peaceful sanctuaries at St. Andrew's Priory in Valyermo, established by 
the Benedictine monks in 1956 and situated 3,600 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
"It's chiefly the trees," Eleutherius said. "One man comes here every Sunday 
from Sunland to picnic and listen to the wind. And children love the sound of 
the wind through the trees. On festival weekend, just watch: Children will come 
here to play or just sit quietly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Event to Benefit Youths 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 visitors are expected at the 500-acre monastery, about 20 miles 
southeast of Palmdale, when St. Andrew's hosts its 33rd annual Valyermo Fall 
Festival next weekend, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday and Sunday. As in 
previous years, the event will benefit the priory's retreat house and 
youth-center programs and promises to offer a variety for all ages. 
</P>
<P>
In the children's world, youngsters can romp on large bouncers, pan for gold, 
have their faces painted by clowns, ride ponies and visit a petting zoo stocked 
with animals from 4-H clubs from Pearblossom and Littlerock. 
</P>
<P>
Artists from throughout the Southland and the Northwest will be represented in 
a variety of media, and craft demonstrations will be given on the grounds in 
weaving, pottery, wood carving, stained glass and jewelry. A highlight of the 
art works is the ceramic plaques by Father Maur van Doorslaer, an 
internationally renowned painter of monochrome studies. 
</P>
<P>
Mass will be celebrated at 10 a.m. Saturday, on the hour from 7 a.m. to noon 
Sunday, and at 5 and 6 p.m. both days, in a cozy building that was once a barn. 
Also on both days, John West will lead the Valyermo Dancers of Reseda in 
liturgical dances at 3:30 p.m. to celebrate vesper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fun for Young and Old 
</P>
<P>
Roaming the grounds will be costumed mimes, dancers, jugglers and musicians. 
"We'll have bingo games for seniors who may want to sit and rest," said Father 
Werner de Morchoven, 72, chairman of the festival, whose organically grown 
apples from 1,000 trees will be on sale. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the weary in search of solace can always visit Father 
Eleutherius' garden, where the temperature is often 20 degrees cooler than 
other parts of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Belgium, the 80-year-old cleric recently visited his homeland for 
two months in honor of his birthday, and recalled when he first saw poplars in 
southern Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked them because they grow fast," he said. "When I was in St. Cloud, 
Minn., I saw many trees. But here in Valyermo, no trees. No poplars, only 
desert. Someone gave me a poplar in 1963. I planted it and from that one tree, 
all of these (grew). But my garden is purely a hobby. I have no time." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 26 years, in between his writing, teaching philosophy classes at 
Claremont McKenna College in Pomona, celebrating weekly Mass at the monastery 
and Saturdays at Mira Loma County jail, Eleutherius has found time to plant 
other trees -- three varieties of pine, weeping willow, cedar, cottonwood, 
maple, a sycamore and a cherry, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Watering twice a day is mandatory. "When it's very hot and when trees are very 
young, three times a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lovingly Planted 
</P>
<P>
He laid out the carpet of grass throughout the garden by hand, beginning with a 
square of sod taken from the monastery's pastures near the gate. Several 
varieties of cacti, including one group from Arizona, border one side of the 
garden and were either begun from a few leaves or were gifts from monastery 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
And the flowers, only a few of which are in bloom now, got their start as 
seedlings in Eleutherius' room. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor flowers," he said. "I put them in pots because they were being eaten 
by the rabbits." 
</P>
<P>
Neither manure nor pesticides are used and yet, several weeks ago, with flowers 
in bloom, the garden was splashed in color with petunias, roses, sweet peas, 
chrysanthemums, dahlias, irises, crocuses, daisies and tulips, among others. 
Now only the Easter lilies, a few cosmos and marigolds remain, the former also 
"pilfered" from the church. 
</P>
<P>
"My garden is the garden of the poor, but God loves my flowers anyway," he 
said. "I wanted to show that if you work and water and have patience, you can 
achieve something." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a serious gopher problem, Eleutherius refuses to use anything stronger 
than water to combat the rodents. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the gophers," he said, comparing them to marauding urban gangs as they 
destroy roots. "We have lost at least 25 trees to the gopher. When I see a 
gopher attacking a tree, I water and water and water. Then he won't come back." 
</P>
<P>
Being located in the middle of the high desert also means there are snakes, but 
the snakes at the priory are "good snakes," he said. To keep the lawn trimmed, 
he uses an old-fashioned lawn mower because the noise and fumes of an 
engine-powered one would disturb the garden's peace and quiet. At night, the 
cottontail rabbits help keep the grasses trimmed too. 
</P>
<P>
As visitors approach the monastery from the winding hillside road, the 
80-foot-high Lombardi poplars and Sequoia giganteas can be seen from afar, an 
incongruous oasis of green in the brown desert. In recent years, the state 
forestry service has offered Eleutherius a number of shrubs and grasses to test 
their fire resistance in the desert clime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thriving in Garden 
</P>
<P>
Herbs, such as mint, sage and rosemary, thrive in the garden, but are not used 
to supply the priory's kitchen with flavorings and spices. Each of the 27 monks 
who reside at the facility takes his turn in the kitchen, preparing and serving 
meals to guests. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Father Maur's King David, red delicious and golden delicious apples, a 
variety of foods will be sold next weekend. A farmers market will offer produce 
from local growers, fast food from hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, soft drinks and 
beer to finer, more leisurely cuisine including Continental, Oriental and 
Mexican dishes. The Teahouse of the September Moon, for example, will serve 
Chinese fare at one corner of a lake populated by ducks. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, the Benedictine monks served as missionaries in Taiwan, Malaysia, 
the Philippines and in China where they were expelled by the Communists in 
1952. They were publicly humiliated and forced to march from western Chengdu in 
Sichuan Province to the Hong Kong border. Leaders of the order, based in 
Belgium, chose Valyermo and established St. Andrew's Priory with the idea of 
eventually returning to China. 
</P>
<P>
They never returned. Eleutherius spent four years in Rome, before assuming 
philosophy teaching posts in Zaire, Africa; Bangador in south India, and at St. 
John's College near St. Cloud, Minn. When he started his garden in Valyermo, he 
was 53. 
</P>
<P>
"But Father Phillip is the real gardener," Eleutherius said. "For myself, it's 
only a hobby. When I am not here and have no time to take care of it, I ask 
people to water it. The rest, I leave to God." 
</P>

BALLET FOLKLORICO DE MEXICO AMAZES AT SHRINE AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The classic symbols of Mexican identity are, of course, the serpent and the 
eagle: creatures portrayed at the very start of the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico 
performance Thursday in Shrine Auditorium. However, for Amalia Hernandez's 
spectacular company (in Los Angeles through Sunday afternoon), the iguana and 
the deer may be equally significant. 
</P>
<P>
The iguana turns up in "Tarima de Tixtla" at a moment when the whole 6,000-seat 
theater is vibrating from the energy of 12 couples furiously fanning themselves 
with scarfs while pounding the stage with percussive, high-velocity footwork. 
At just the point where it doesn't seem possible for the dancing to become more 
galvanic, one man and then the others begin to twist and slither on the floor, 
surrounding the women, eyes popping and tongues a-quiver. 
</P>
<P>
It's an amazing metamorphosis, one that makes us suddenly reappraise the corps 
dancers as individuals while reminding us of the deep links to the animal 
kingdom that underpin so much Mexican folk art. 
</P>
<P>
The Yaqui Deer Dance, of course, represents the noblest expression of this 
kinship, suggesting not merely animal motion but a different way of 
experiencing the world. Other Mexican and Mexican-American companies present 
narrative versions ending with hunters killing the deer, but Ballet Folklorico 
chooses to offer its "Danza del Venado" as a ritual of coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
This decision is daring -- the usual death throes obviously create a more 
dramatic conclusion than the group pose seen on Thursday -- but Hernandez has 
never exactly been timid about making a personal statement with this company. 
In her new "Feria de Carnival en Tlaxcala," she takes her biggest risk of all. 
</P>
<P>
Subtitled "Folklore of America," this extended suite attempts to sample the 
overlapping cultural influences in contemporary Mexico and so rejects any 
pretense of ethnic purity. We hear a tango, a polka and even rock 'n' roll. We 
see improbably elaborate and anachronistic costumes from some sci-fi Mayan 
Melrose. We follow an archetypal Don Juan parable (complete with a puppet show 
on the seven deadly sins) about a seducer carried off to hell. And we are 
blitzed by wave after wave of decorative, exhausting group dances. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the mix never really ignites, but it proves highly revealing as 
it sputters from one effect to another -- objectifying the passion for theater 
that has always shaped Hernandez's approach to folklore. For all her 
anthropological research, she is essentially a social muralist and in "Feria de 
Carnival" she creates a broad panorama of entertainments for the modern 
campesino. From a diminutive vaudeville-style automobile to an expansive 
bull-ring procession, she embraces them all, and her finale confirms that even 
funerals can be quite a show. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the program has its share of traditional pleasures -- ranging from 
the formal depictions of pre-Columbian ceremonies in "Tenochtitlan" and "The 
Concheros," to the explosive Tlacotalpan and Jalisco fiestas with their 
exciting live music (in contrast to the over-amplified tapes that accompany 
some of the other suites). But even here, Hernandez's stylization of her folk 
materials proves distinctive and characteristically bold. 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Folklorico is, indisputably, her vision of Mexican culture (not just 
Mexican dance). Other valuable approaches exist, but this is the one with 
enough heat and savvy to make the uninitiated into aficionados -- to send 
dazzled, middle-class Anglos scurrying off to bookstores and record shops and 
travel agencies. Even to other folkloric companies, too. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Latinos identify with the company for different and, doubtless, more 
profound reasons, but to some of us, the appeal of Ballet Folklorico remains as 
irrational and overwhelming as first love. It pulled us out of our predefined 
ethnic identities into a magnificent civilization that spoke to us more deeply 
than we could have guessed. It still does. 
</P>
<P>
Political footnote: At the end of the performance, embattled Mayor Tom Bradley 
presented Hernandez with a city commendation -- and was given a mask by tour 
co-producer Julio Solorzano "to ward off evil spirits." He seemed very 
appreciative.

FACES . . .: TAMING ACTION ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"It's much bigger than Arnold Schwarzenegger," Jean-Claude Van Damme says 
jokingly about the length of his name. "It looks better on the screen." And 
with his current martial-arts movie, "Kickboxer," it is the movie screen where 
the 1980 middleweight Full-Contact Karate World Champion is now on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Contending for a place in the action-adventure genre, the 28-year-old 
Belgian-born actor knows he has aligned himself against powerful adversaries. 
Still, Van Damme is not thrown off by the likes of Sylvester Stallone or Chuck 
Norris. He is going to be different. "Too much macho is no good," he says in 
his heavy French accent. "They (the audience) want to see someone human." 
</P>
<P>
It was Van Damme's prowess in shotokan karate that scored him his first 
starring role, a break that took three years to come. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted me because my English wasn't good and the only thing I had to 
show was the karate," he says. Finally, the weight-trained Van Damme got a 
chance to show off his physique and his flexibility to producer Menahem Golan. 
Golan was impressed and handed him the script to "Bloodsport." But Van Damme 
remembers more about the meeting: "He saw in my eyes that I was hungry." 
</P>
<P>
A young man with a successful gymnasium business in his native Brussels, Van 
Damme decided in 1981 to try for his childhood dream and, as the cliche goes, 
he sold everything and struck out for a new title: star. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody, even my father, was very upset that I wanted to go to America to be 
a movie star. It was very difficult when I came to this country." Van Damme 
recalls having to take odd jobs such as a bouncer in Newport Beach and as a 
pizza deliveryman. 
</P>
<P>
But even now, with three movies under his black belt and a fourth in 
production, Van Damme is still hungry. "I'm in the same state now when Arnold 
was when he did 'Pumping Iron,' " he says leaning forward, serious. "I have a 
lot to do to make it. . . . Now that I'm here, I have to keep going. I have to 
be better." MITCHELL SAM ROSSI

'NIGHT GAME' A TRIP TO SLASHERVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years after directing Geraldine Page to an Oscar in the poignant Horton 
Foote drama "A Trip to Bountiful," director Peter Masterson crashes out of type 
with a slasher movie set in Galveston, Tex., about a maniacal hook-handed 
stalker who kills beautiful blondes on a lonely, deserted stretch of beach 
immediately after Houston Astros victories. 
</P>
<P>
In "Night Game" (citywide), helicopters relentlessly circle skyscrapers. The 
police -- regular guys with gamy home lives -- are puzzled, angry. They scream, 
bash each other on the noggin in frustration. Every time they arrive on the 
scene to investigate, two or three of them have to be pulled apart from 
strangling each other in a wild melee. 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder they're frustrated. The crazed killer has so little respect for 
their intelligence that he sends messages of apology to local sportswriters 
whenever he botches up his own serial pattern. And, meanwhile, beautiful young 
blondes -- including the petulant fiancee (Karen Young) of investigating police 
Lt. Mike Seaver (Roy Scheider) -- keep trotting down that lonely beach like 
lemmings, or wandering down dark streets, or disappearing into the crazy house 
-- always in oblivious ignorance that the Houston Astros are about to win 
another one. 
</P>
<P>
There's no way to make this work -- short of finding a new Ed Wood Jr. ("Plan 9 
From Outer Space") to mess it up amusingly. "Night Game" answers the burning 
question: Would bad, improbably plotted slasher movies be any better if they 
had humor, strong characters and pungent dialogue instead of incessant 
car-crashes and blood-letting? The answer, surprisingly, is no. 
</P>
<P>
There's one near-excellent performance, though: Richard Bradford's sly, sodden, 
dyspeptic old police chief. It's a shame that directors like Masterson and 
actors like Bradford have to get hornswoggled into nonsense like "Night Game" 
(MPAA-rated R for sex, language and violence), when there's wonderful Texas 
material lying around just aching to be made. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

POP BEAT: FUNKY GEORGE CLINTON AND CREW ARE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jail or no jail, James Brown is Soul Brother No. 1, but his hits have been 
harvested so relentlessly by rap producers in the last few years that fresh 
grooves are near-impossible to find. 
</P>
<P>
So if you've watched an episode or two of "Yo! MTV Raps" lately, you've heard a 
lot of George Clinton, Soul Brother No. 2, instead, as rappers are mining riffs 
from the various divisions of Clinton's vast P.Funk combine. 
</P>
<P>
You probably recognize the obvious stuff: MC Hammer's version of Parliament's 
"Mothership"; De La Soul's cop of Funkadelic's "Knee Deep"; Eazy-E's take on 
Bootsy Collins' "We Want Bootsy" among other subtler examples. These days 
P.Funk's bottom-heavy dance-thuds set the funky agenda for everything from 
go-go to hard-core rap to commercials aired on Saturday morning TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you hear something in the commercials, (the P.Funk sound) is in 
there," Clinton said in an office at Warner Bros. Records' Burbank 
headquarters. "That Hershey's chocolate jam is the funkiest thing I've heard in 
years." 
</P>
<P>
George Clinton is a formidable guy, scowling from beneath dark trapezoidal 
shades, puffing out his bomber jacket like a Big 10 left tackle. He undoes his 
ponytail, and loosens a majestic, cherry-red hair extension that makes Twisted 
Sister look like Paul Schaffer. When you reach to shake his hand, he throws 
about a half-dozen arcane variants of the soul shake at you before settling on 
a straight high-five. Which you miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been gone for a while, hunting quail on his Michigan farm. But 
this fall the funk is back: three re-released early Funkadelic albums are 
available for the first time since the beginning of the '70s; there's a new 
Funkadelic LP due on MCA and a new solo album, "The Cinderella Theory," is out 
on Prince's Paisley Park label; and Clinton has taken a re-formed P.Funk 
All-Stars on the road (they're at the Palace on Tuesday and Wednesday). 
</P>
<P>
"Why Should I Dog U Out?", the first single from the solo album, is the usual 
P.Funk blend of cranked bass and howling-pun lyrics, overlaid with a truly 
encyclopedic collection of sampled hip-hop snips. Another track features raps 
from Public Enemy's Chuck D. and Flavor Flav. The Funkadelic LP includes a 
monster-jam version of Cream's "Sunshine of Your Love." 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, P.Funk sired more hit spinoffs than Norman Lear. By the end of the 
decade, it was less accurate to talk of Clinton's position within the world of 
R&amp;B than of his dominance of it. The late-'70s Mothership Tour played 
Coliseum-size venues across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bottom dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hot as fire," Clinton said. "We were signing groups up, getting 
$700,000 for an album, spending $100,000 a week to keep us on the road -- and 
it was working. We'd just, like, walk into the record company office and say, 
'Here's the record.' 
</P>
<P>
"But like with anything, there's a planned obsolescence that comes around. When 
you get to that stage, there's nothing you can do short of a freak situation. 
Prince was there -- he's lucky 'Batman' came along when it did. After so many 
records, it's time for somebody else. And we knew the nostalgia thing would 
bring us around again." 
</P>
<P>
Clinton was as famous for his lucrative game of record-company roulette as he 
was for his edge-of-the-universe concept albums; at its peak P.Funk managed to 
sell its spinoffs to as many as five labels at once, permutations with 
essentially the same personnel and awesomely funky outer-space raunch conceits. 
</P>
<P>
"Warners used to ask us why we didn't give them 'Flashlight.' Casablanca used 
to ask us why we didn't give them 'One Nation Under a Groove.' They both had 
hit records, and they even did co-promotions together -- they got off cheap. 
But now, the young A&amp;R guys don't even realize that Funkadelic is basically 
the same kind of thing guys like Living Colour are noted for." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Clinton has a longer and wider perspective on these things than most 
people in the pop industry. Now 48, he began his career as a Frankie 
Lymon-influenced doo-wop singer in the mid-'50s, floated in and out of a 
songwriting gig at Motown in the early '60s, and had a Temptations-style hit, 
"(I Just Want To) Testify," with the Parliaments in 1967 on an obscure Detroit 
label. The label went belly up, and he formed Funkadelic with his backup band. 
</P>
<P>
"Motown mixed with our own psychedelic cult thing," is how Clinton described 
the Funkadelic approach, which also sported simple, dominant bass lines, 
wacked-out cosmic lyrics and mind-bending fuzz guitar wilder than Hendrix. Its 
classics had titles like "Maggot Brain" and "America Eats Its Young"; spiritual 
heirs include Cameo, the Ohio Players and Prince. 
</P>
<P>
Now Prince is repaying the debt, though Clinton is mum about the Purple One's 
role in the recording of "The Cinderella Theory." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you about that, man, it's in my contract. Prince was very 
instrumental in vibes, and direction, and what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
So Prince hung out? 
</P>
<P>
"Mmmmmm . . . He'd be there," Clinton said. "It's his studio, man. 'Slammin' ' 
sounds like Prince. I used his horn section and his keyboardist. I tried to be 
as close to a thing Prince could sell as I could, considering I'd cut most of 
it before we started to work together -- that was enough to identify us with 
Paisley Park." 
</P>

FANCY FOOTWORK RESCUES PRETENTIOUS JACKSON SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Jackson's ambitious new "telemusical," possessively titled "Janet 
Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814," is much like the upcoming album of the same name 
-- pretentious but fun. What little script there is in this half-hour "message" 
film is deadly, but plenty of fancy footwork saves the day. (The expensive 
project premieres on MTV at 6:30 tonight and airs again on Sunday and 
Wednesday, never to be seen again till its Oct. 17 home video release). 
</P>
<P>
The can-humans-really-do-that? choreography in the three dance numbers is on a 
par with, and may even top, the best of brother Michael's hoof-happy videos. 
"Miss You Much" is full of joy and giddy goofiness, and establishes shyly 
grinning Janet -- a real team player in this big production number -- as 
winsome and human after some of her earlier ice-goddess poses. "The Knowledge" 
and "Rhythm Nation" are angrier performances; the former is a bravura solo 
rooftop dance, with Jackson breaking windows and knocking over objects in rage 
at the dying of the light. 
</P>
<P>
What connects these numbers is an anti-drug story, unfortunately bolstered by 
the glitziness-among-the-L.A.-ruins imagery of "Blade Runner." Director Dominic 
Sena's slick penchant for neato futuristic grime hardly contributes any saving 
realism to the drug saga. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson intones some silly narration and spoken-word slogans in a voice that 
renders her well-intentioned sincerity somewhat campy. When it comes to 
pretentiousness, Janet, just say no! But the big-bass songs and the dazzling 
dancing say what the hokey script can't. Her feet, her body, her grace and her 
lightning speed are fine arguments for sobriety indeed. CHRIS WILLMAN

'CAPITOL STEPS' LEAD TO GOOD-NATURED D.C. SATIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Multiply Mark Russell by eight and you get an idea of who "The Capitol Steps" 
are and what they're about, in a show that airs at 6:30 tonight on KCET Channel 
28. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe is a musical and comedy ensemble that satirizes some of the 
characters and issues streaming through Washington like perpetual works in 
progress that seem structurally flawed, or never quite headed anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Since they began in Washington as a group of young political staffers putting 
on a Christmas show for Sen. Charles Percy, Capitol Steps' topicality and 
outlook have a distinct inside-the-beltway frame of reference. Their sketches 
are adaptations of popular songs. 
</P>
<P>
There's a collegial, musical revue fondness in their style, which is broad and 
cheery enough to spare them censure on the part of the political establishment 
-- they deal in broad cartoon strokes, as, for example, when a Ronald Reagan 
character nods while a George Bush character sings "In the jungle, there's been 
a bungle, while Reagan sleeps tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Their work lacks real sting, therefore, except in one number that suggests Dan 
Quayle isn't the scariest successor to the presidency, it's his wife Marilyn. 
But it does have enough point about government waste and stupidity to make you 
wonder what the audience, a "stellar crowd of political VIPs," as their PR 
release tells us, is laughing at. LAWRENCE CHRISTON

LAWMAKERS WILL ALLOW ORANGE COUNTY TO VOTE ON TAX TO BUILD JAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Legislature passed a hotly contested bill shortly before midnight 
Friday which would allow Orange County residents to vote on a half-cent sales 
tax increase for new jail and court facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The measure passed by one vote in the Assembly on the third roll-call in the 
waning hours of the 1989 session. The bill now goes to Gov. George Deukmejian 
for his signature. If signed, the Orange County Board of Supervisors could put 
the sales tax increase on the ballot as early as next June. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate had voted earlier Friday, 23-11, for the same measure, which is 
intended to help finance a $700-million jail in Gypsum Canyon near Anaheim 
Hills, followed a round of emotional debate and bickering that pitted state 
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) against her Orange County rival, Sen. 
John Seymour (R-Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
Both are seeking the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor next year, 
and the fate of a new Orange County jail could be a factor in the race. Orange 
County supervisors voted last month to spend the sales tax money on a new 
6,720-bed jail in Gypsum Canyon -- in Seymour's district -- allaying fears that 
it would be built in Santa Ana -- Bergeson's district. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Bergeson and Sheriff Brad Gates have vigorously pursued the sales 
tax measure because it would yield $126 million a year in crucial seed money 
for the new jail and a courthouse in Santa Ana. Gates has said the average 
Orange County family will end up paying about $25 a year, with the rest of the 
tab being picked up by tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Without the money, Gates says, his deputies will be forced to continue the 
early release of more than 50,000 criminals a year because of overcrowded jail 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
County voters also will be asked in November to consider a half-cent sales tax 
increase for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County jail tax increase proposal that was passed Friday by the 
Senate was part of an omnibus bill, created just this week, that also would 
allow Los Angeles and four other financially strapped counties to ask voters 
for similar half-cent sales tax increases to build more cells. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the measures have complained that the sales tax increases, which 
require only a simple majority of voters in each county to approve, are efforts 
to circumvent Proposition 13 restrictions that call for a two-thirds majority 
vote on all tax increases. A similar sales tax increase, approved by San Diego 
County voters in 1988, was held unconstitutional earlier this year by a 
Riverside Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
During Assembly debate on the measure, Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) 
attacked the proposal, saying: "This bill is a frontal assault on Proposition 
13. I urge a 'no' vote." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata), sponsor of the omnibus package, responded: 
"This is the only game in town. A sales tax is the only option these counties 
have. Nobody likes a sales tax, but this is one bill that will solve their 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents also have lambasted the measures for not including provisions 
against putting expanded jail facilities in Latino communities, such as Santa 
Ana and East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns about have bedeviled the Orange County measure since Bergeson 
introduced it earlier this year. Three times the bill appeared to be dealt 
fatal blows by opponents. But Bergeson was able to revive it and push it 
through the legislative process, arguing that the sales tax increases were 
needed to preserve "law and order." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue to enact laws with mandatory incarceration only to turn 
people loose because we don't have a place to put them," Bergeson told her 
Senate colleagues Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Her comments came when debate over the concerns of ethnic neighborhoods -- 
particularly in Los Angeles -- flared once again and prompted state Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles) to plead with his colleagues to hold the measure for 
study next year. 
</P>
<P>
Torres contended that without a special prohibition, the measure would make it 
easier for Los Angeles County to add 2,408 prison beds in heavily Chinese and 
Latino neighborhoods of his district, where there are already jails. 
</P>
<P>
"Where will they build these jails?" Torres asked. "Right in East L.A. Right in 
downtown Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, while Torres hit the measure because of the threat of jails in the 
Latino community, Seymour also criticized it because it would put prisoners in 
a predominantly Anglo area of Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour also accused Bergeson of having a hidden agenda for pushing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill doesn't call for it there (but) Sen. Bergeson made a deal in which 
she said, 'I won't move this bill until the supervisors decided that this jail 
will be built in Gypsum Canyon,' " said Seymour, a former Anaheim mayor. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It's an area that is environmentally sensitive, sensitive to the 
residential areas. . . . And I have always been opposed to that as a location." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson -- who has steadfastly maintained that any decision on where to put 
the jail rests with the county supervisors, not state lawmakers -- bristled at 
Seymour's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"No process has been violated, and I deeply resent that charge," she shot back. 
</P>
<P>
While defending her motives in pushing the tax measure, Bergeson also came 
under attack for the parliamentary tactics she used to allow the sales tax bill 
to slip out of the Senate and go back to the Assembly for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
On the first round of voting, Senators voted, 21-10, to pass the measure. 
Bergeson had captured the requisite majority of the 40 Senators to move the 
bill along. 
</P>
<P>
But Torres, in a last-ditch effort to keep the sales tax package bottled up, 
used the parliamentary procedure to put the measure on hold so he could try to 
"work the bill" and change votes so it would fail. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, such a hold -- known as a "call" -- is placed on a bill until it is 
lifted by the senator who requested it. That is considered common courtesy in 
the more sedate upper house. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bergeson shocked Torres and others opposed to the sales tax measure by 
standing up a few minutes after debate and asking on her own that the Torres 
call be lifted on the bill. Before Torres realized what she had done, a roll 
call vote had begun and the Senators tallied 23-11 in favor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
When it was ruled that Bergeson's actions were within Senate rules, Torres 
began shouting and pointing at the Newport Beach Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be the rules, but it is rude!" he said, glowering at Bergeson. 
</P>
<P>
When the Senate reconvened after lunch, Bergeson apologized for the breech of 
etiquette and offered to subject the bill to a third roll call. But Torres, 
conceding he didn't have the votes to stop it, said he wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
As a peace offering, Bergeson sent Torres a box of candy, legislative staff 
members said.

VIETNAMESE IMMIGRANT GETS 7-YEAR SENTENCE FOR ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A judge, swayed by a psychiatric report warning that Be Tu Van Tran's 
anti-communist fanaticism may again drive him to violence, on Friday sent the 
Vietnamese immigrant to prison for seven years for a 1986 political 
assassination attempt in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Just four months ago, when the 33-year-old Tran entered what amounted to a 
guilty plea in the shooting of a former Saigon housing minister, his lawyer 
predicted that the Santa Ana man would only have to spend a few months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald, saying he would 
not condone violent attempts to prevent free expression, told Tran bluntly in 
court Friday, "If you want the credit for the crime, you also must do the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
A slight and withdrawn former deliveryman, Tran became a popular hero among 
strident anti-communist factions of the local Vietnamese community after he 
claimed credit for stalking, shooting and critically wounding Tran Kanh Van, 
who had been portrayed as a communist "lackey" by militant immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In confessing to the March 18, 1986, attack, Tran told police that he was 
driven by rage to shoot Van after the Westminster businessman was quoted in a 
Los Angeles Times Magazine piece as espousing normalized relations with 
Vietnam. Tran has since given conflicting statements about his role. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Robert Weinberg, maintaining that the passive but 
politically fiery Tran took responsibility for the shooting only as a "badge of 
honor" in the fight against communism, continued to insist Friday that his 
client may be innocent. 
</P>
<P>
And Weinberg added in an interview that, in light of the stern sentence, his 
legal maneuverings have clearly backfired. The attorney expressed reservations 
about having Tran enter in May what is commonly known as a "slow plea." 
</P>
<P>
Under that rarely used legal arrangement, Tran gave up his right to a jury 
trial -- a trial that could have reopened war wounds in the Vietnamese 
community -- and effectively pleaded guilty to the crime of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
He had faced a maximum nine-year sentence under the arrangement, but Weinberg 
-- raising the ire of the judge -- had publicly voiced confidence that his 
client would not spend more than a few months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
That prediction proved wrong Friday as Fitzgerald first rejected Weinberg's 
motion for a new trial and then refused to set the defendant free on probation 
or give him minimal jail time. Weinberg said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald, unswayed by Weinberg's claim that newly discovered evidence proved 
his client's innocence, said he considered Tran "a danger to society, a 
substantial danger, especially to those who would ever espouse the thought of a 
reunified Vietnam under communist control." 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was a victory for Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans, who 
told Fitzgerald that Tran's attack and the glory he took in it afterward are 
particularly heinous affronts to a society that values free expression. 
</P>
<P>
"He's proud of (the shooting)," Evans said. "He's not remorseful." 
</P>
<P>
In delivering the sentence in the Santa Ana courtroom, Fitzgerald cited a 
diagnostic study by the State Department of Corrections that said Tran has 
reluctantly expressed only "superficial remorse." The mental-health 
professionals who examined Tran described him as a possible manic-depressive 
and said that his "fanatical" commitment to anti-communism suggests that 
"should his political cause deem it, he will re-offend regardless of the 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Weinberg said he was puzzled by Tran's lack of remorse in the 
corrections report. "He's intelligent enough to fake it," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
While Tran told state and local health officials that he did not shoot Tran, he 
was quoted in the corrections report as saying that the shooting was "a good 
lesson" for the victim "because he was a traitor, he worked for South Vietnam, 
(and) now he supports North Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Tran Khanh Van, now living in hiding, wanted to attend Friday's 
sentencing but did not at the urging of local prosecutors who feared for his 
safety. Those present at Tran's sentencing, including half a dozen of the 
defendant's supporters, had to pass through a metal detector before entering 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Van, ambushed as he walked from his Westminster real estate office to his car, 
was shot twice and seriously injured. The attack came about 10 weeks after Tran 
was quoted in The Times' magazine as saying: "The only way to change Vietnam's 
repressive Marxism is to work with those who will become the next generation of 
leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Van has insisted he was misquoted but told officials preparing the Tran report 
that he has nonetheless been subjected even today to continued threats and 
harassment from extremist anti-communists. 
</P>
<P>
Tran, meanwhile, became the subject of a laudatory book after taking credit for 
the crime and has been revered by some in the local Vietnamese community as an 
inspiring role model in the bid to take back their native land from the 
communist regime.

EX-CONVICT CHARGED IN ACCIDENTAL POLICE SHOOTING OF TODDLER 
</P>

<P>
A convicted bank robber whose flight from officers allegedly led to the 
accidental police shooting of a 10-month-old Anaheim girl was charged Friday 
with the baby's wounding and ordered held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Paul Harston's arraignment was continued for two weeks, but prosecutors 
filed a criminal complaint charging him with kidnaping the 
</P>
<P>
baby and her mother and assaulting the baby and the officer, who was identified 
in court documents Friday as Leonard Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Capt. Randall Gaston would only identify the officer as 36 years 
old and a 15-year veteran of the Police Department. Gaston said this was the 
first shooting of Rivera's law-enforcement career. 
</P>
<P>
The officer declined through supervisors to be interviewed but was said to be 
concerned for the baby's welfare. As is routine in shootings by officers, 
Rivera is on paid leave and has seen the police psychiatrist, who will decide 
when he is ready to return to duty. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, Michelle Olmos, was released Thursday from the hospital with a 
wounded buttock and is expected to heal with only the faintest of scars. She 
was wounded once in the 
</P>
<P>
right buttock as she sat strapped in the front passenger seat beside her 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
As Jody Olmos, 31, idled Wednesday morning in traffic on State College 
Boulevard, a man climbed into her car, pointed a gun at her head and reportedly 
said, "Drive, or I'll shoot you." Police say the gunman abandoned his rental 
car and was fleeing officers who chased him for running a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, a motorcycle officer, ordered the gunman to surrender. Police say the 
gunman did not. Seeing the intruder pointing a semiautomatic handgun at Olmos 
and then Rivera, the officer fired from 10 feet behind Olmos' Mercury, and two 
shots shattered her rear windshield, authorities said. One slug lodged in a car 
seat, the other pierced the passenger seat and struck the infant, who was in 
front because she constantly climbed out of her safety seat. 
</P>
<P>
The Olmos family criticized the officer for firing at the gunman when, they 
said, he should have seen the child safety seat in the rear of the car. They 
said it is frightening that Rivera could fire twice from "so close" and miss 
his target. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael W. Nunn said Friday that results 
so far of his department's investigation of the shooting show that Rivera 
"acted properly and according to procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Gaston said the Anaheim Police Department's policy on use of deadly force holds 
that an officer may use a gun to protect himself or others from what the 
officer "reasonably believes is an imminent threat of death or serious bodily 
injury." Such force is also considered justified in order to "prevent the 
escape or arrest of a fleeing felon if the officer has reasonable cause to 
believe the crime" caused serious harm to someone. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera's actions, Gaston and Nunn said, were within those guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston said there is a variety of hostage scenarios to which an officer might 
react differently, depending on his position in relation to a suspect and his 
ability to seek cover. Because the intruder pointed his gun at Rivera, police 
said, he did not have that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"It is to our advantage not to rush the situation or create an immediate need 
to use a gun," Gaston said. "However, there are some situations where an 
officer is vulnerable and has to decide . . . 'Do I stand there and let them 
drive off or try to shoot and stop them?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a millisecond of a decision," Gaston said, "and it's the longest 
millisecond of your life." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Harston, 24, was charged in Municipal Court in Fullerton with seven 
felonies. They were one count each of evading arrest, being a felon in 
possession of a gun, assault on an officer, assault with a firearm on an 
officer, assault -- for the baby's shooting -- and two counts of kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the kidnaping charges alone, Harston, an unemployed drifter 
with a history of drug use, could be sentenced to life in prison without the 
possibility of parole, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Harston violated his parole on a federal bank robbery conviction, 
Municipal Judge Kazuharu Makino ordered him held without bail in Orange County 
Jail pending his arraignment Sept. 29. He was assigned a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he charged Harston with assaulting the child with a deadly weapon 
because "the child got hurt as a result of his actions." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting would never have occurred had Harston not threatened people with 
his own gun after bolting from traffic officers Wednesday morning, Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the guy had driven off with the mother and baby, everyone would be saying 
he should have shot the guy," Nunn said. Rivera "did the best he could do. Any 
way around it, that (officer) is going to lose. But the officer is not on trial 
here. Mr. Harston is. And I would like to get him sent to jail for the rest of 
his life."

AN ACE WRESTLER'S LIFE CUT SHORT;

CSUF ATHLETE IS KILLED ON MOTORCYCLE

Erin Millsap, a champion wrestler at Cal State Fullerton who started in the 
sport at age 5 and dreamed of making the 1992 Olympic team, died early Friday 
when he was thrown from a motorcycle he was riding near campus. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old junior was a passenger on a motorcycle driven by Paul Reutzel, 
a former teammate. Reutzel lost control of the vehicle as they were traveling 
east down a steep slope on Bastanchury Road just east of State College 
Boulevard, throwing them onto the pavement, said Fullerton Police Sgt. Rex 
Strickland. Millsap was dead at the scene at 12:12 a.m. Friday. Reutzel, of 
Diamond Bar, was in guarded condition Friday with a mild concussion at St. Jude 
Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
News of the accident hit Millsap's friends, teammates and Sigma Pi fraternity 
brothers hard Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 118-pound athlete had been in training for a new wrestling season, 
scheduled to begin in November. Cal State Fullerton wrestling coach Dan Lewis 
canceled Friday afternoon practice and met with the team, most of whose members 
were aware of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for us all to believe," Lewis said. "It will take a while. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a real good motivator to the athletes," Lewis said. "It's so 
unfortunate for such a young player." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the wrestling gymnasium, about a dozen of Millsap's teammates sat, some 
silent, others crying, still stunned by the news. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so young -- it's hard to imagine," said Ramon Diaz, 21, who said he and 
Millsap were best friends. "I thought it was just a bad joke when someone told 
me. It's hard for me to know he's gone. This was our year." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz said that he and Millsap had high hopes of being teammates in the 1992 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"He had so much talent," Diaz said. "He could have been on top of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Millsap competed in the NCAA Wrestling Tournament at Oklahoma City in March but 
did not place in the 118-pound class. He had a season record of 36-8-2 as a 
sophomore and 22-13 as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Millsap took third in the freestyle Espoir Cup championship, an 
international competition of five countries in Newfoundland. He also finished 
fourth in the six-country Greco-Roman championships in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
Millsap often competed against larger opponents. What he lacked in size, 
Millsap told the Times in a January interview, he made up for in strength, 
speed, good technical skills and a quality he called "slickness." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he made the national Top 20 by the Amateur Wrestling News. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always the underdog," Millsap said at the time. "I'd rather prey on 
sympathy than have to go out there and be No. 1. . . . Now I'm going to have to 
get past that." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that Millsap had been on his way to becoming an All-American, which 
was one of his goals before finishing college. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz remembered the help he got from Millsap when he was thrown from a 
motorcycle last year and was hospitalized for a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always there to walk me through the bad times," Diaz said. "He was 
always cheering me on. 
</P>
<P>
"God teaches you things in funny ways. I don't know what I'm going to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Millsap was always on the go, Diaz said. A picture sticks in his mind, Diaz 
said, of a time when they were staying at a hotel in St. Louis to compete in a 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Diaz said, Millsap got up early in the morning and shouted, " 
'Good Morning, St. Louis!' " mimicking the movie, 'Good Morning Vietnam,' and 
that is how I remember him, standing in front of that window." 
</P>
<P>
Former Sigma Pi fraternity President Eric Gustafson described Millsap as a 
"zestful kind of person." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Jacques, the fraternity's president, said that Millsap had had problems 
financially and in school and wrestling but lately "everything was coming 
together for him." 
</P>
<P>
Millsap was born in Saigon in 1968. His parents, Leonard and Iam Millsap, met 
while his father was a U.S. Marine in Vietnam. They have another son, Erick, 
22. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements were pending Friday. Leonard Millsap, who is in the 
merchant marine, was returning home from Japan to handle the details. 
</P>
<P>
Millsap had been living for the past three months about a mile away from campus 
with five other men, many former wrestlers, in an old Victorian home on East 
Ameridge Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Zele, 24, who lived in the house and was a former teammate, said that news 
of the accident "really hasn't sunk in yet." 
</P>
<P>
In his senior year in high school, Millsap was the undefeated state high school 
champion in his division. He also was the national freestyle champion in his 
junior and senior years. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a super individual," said Lon Gwyn, Millsap's coach at South Hills 
High School in West Covina. "He was like a family, he was like my son. I'm 
going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
Millsap started competing in wrestling when he was 5 years old, Diaz said, and 
from then on it was a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
"Wrestling was his only identification," Diaz said. "Wrestling was his life."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE ARRERST MAN AFTER 4-HOUR STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a four-hour standoff Friday morning, police arrested a 31-year-old man 
wanted on suspicion of parole violation and auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph Green Islas, whose last known residence was in Diamond Bar, 
surrendered after police forcibly entered the house in the 1900 block of North 
Bush Street, said Maureen Thomas, a Santa Ana Police Department spokeswoman. 
Islas was being held in Orange County Jail in connection with the theft of a 
car from the Garden Grove area and on suspicion of a parole violation in a 
narcotics-related conviction, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Santa Ana police surrounded the Bush Street house about 8 a.m. 
Friday after receiving a tip that Islas was in their area. They called to the 
man inside to come out and surrender, but the man did not comply. After about 
four hours, police entered the house and found Islas hiding a rear bedroom. "He 
was then arrested without incident," Thomas said.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
FAA AWARDS $950,000 TO IMPROVE SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has awarded the county $950,000 to pay for 
security improvements at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The grant will be used for radio communications, card reader and video 
surveillance systems. 
</P>
<P>
"They were persuaded by the county's need," Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach) said Thursday. "This will spare the expense to county residents." 
</P>
<P>
Cox is one of two Republicans who sit on the House subcommittee on government 
activities and transportation, which will begin hearings Sept. 25 on aviation 
security in response to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally we are updating airline security across the country," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The county will also receive $3.25 million this fiscal year to pay for airport 
improvements including roadways, taxiways, and aircraft rescue and firefighting 
vehicles. That money is part of $10 million budgeted for the airport through 
1992, but will be delivered earlier than expected.

LATINOS CRITICIZE D.A. ON PACE OF POLL-GUARD INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Latino Democrats, angry with the pace of an investigation into the 
Republican Party's use of uniformed poll guards during last November's 
election, had some sharp words for the Orange County district attorney's office 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We express our outrage, our anger, and our shame at the absence of criminal 
charges filed against those responsible for posting uniformed security guards . 
. . at predominantly Hispanic polling places," said Rueben Martinez, county 
Democratic Party treasurer, at a news conference in Santa Ana. "It has been 10 
months since our pride as American citizens was violated; the district attorney 
has yet to file charges." 
</P>
<P>
The county Republican Party spent about $4,000 to station uniformed guards at 
polling places in 20 largely Latino precincts in Santa Ana last Election Day. 
They were hired at the suggestion of a political consultant for state 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who won the 72nd District election 
by fewer than 900 votes. 
</P>
<P>
County Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes has said he authorized the hiring 
of the guards because of rumors that illegal voters were to be bused in to aid 
the Democratic candidate in the Assembly race, Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach. 
</P>
<P>
County Democrats and Latino groups say the stationing of the guards at the 
polling places, and the guards' questioning of voters about their citizenship 
status, violated state and federal laws against interfering with elections and 
intimidating voters. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said Friday he was not pointing a finger at Pringle or Fuentes 
specifically, but only wanted the district attorney's office "to use the same 
diligence against those who steal our rights as those who steal our property." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade, who is heading the county's 
investigation into the incident, said no decision has been made yet on whether 
to file charges. And, he said, he could not predict when the decision might be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation's still going on," Wade said. "We have been doing 
interviews, we've done some within this month. . . . We're analyzing some 
written materials. . . . I can understand if some of the community members are 
anxious to know what our conclusion is." 
</P>
<P>
Wade said one reason the investigation has not gone more quickly is that it is 
being conducted jointly with the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office. "We have 
to coordinate with other agencies," he said. "There are just a whole bunch of 
factors." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law a measure 
prohibiting armed or uniformed security guards at polling places. The measure, 
which met little resistance in the Legislature, was written in reaction to the 
Santa Ana incident. 
</P>
<P>
A civil lawsuit against Pringle, Fuentes and several other Republicans, which 
was filed by six Latino voters who claim they were intimidated by the guards, 
is also pending. One defendant, the security firm that provided the guards, 
settled with the plaintiffs earlier this year for $60,000.

WEATHER LIKELY TO CHANGE AN OCTAVE: FROM MUGGY TO WET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, Times Staff Writer

<P>
Tropical Storm Octave, the moody creature that delivered alternate punches of 
wilting heat, pounding surf and muggy air the last few days, is expected to bow 
out of Orange County this weekend with a final, soggy farewell: a good chance 
of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said Octave was losing its power and that its final gesture 
probably would be scattered showers today as the storm moves onto land. The 
National Weather Service predicted a 60% chance of rain today, decreasing to 
40% on Sunday. If the rain materializes, it could be the first measurable 
rainfall in Orange County since June 10. 
</P>
<P>
Although temperatures were lower and the surf was calmer on Friday, it still 
felt hot and muggy. Anaheim, where the thermometer was 96 degrees, posted a 
countywide record high for a Sept. 15, breaking the previous record of 94 
degrees set in 1956, also in Anaheim, according to Jim Sleeper, a county 
historian. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said Octave, which was flinging its moisture at Southern 
California as it spun north off the coast, was weakening as it departed. 
</P>
<P>
Today's temperatures were expected to be about 80 degrees inland and in the low 
to upper 70s near the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's big waves had died down at most beaches by Friday, leaving a two- to 
four-foot surf, only moderately higher than usual. Newport Beach was the 
exception: Lifeguards there saw a second day of six- to eight-foot sets. 
</P>
<P>
Smog eased off too. Two first-stage alerts were called by the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District on Thursday, and not issued Friday. Air quality was 
considered good in the El Toro area and moderate in all other parts of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures were generally cooler Friday throughout most of Orange County. In 
El Toro, where the mercury topped out at 94 degrees Thursday, it was only 88 
Friday. In San Juan Capistrano, where it was 100 Thursday, temperatures peaked 
at 83 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the heat and high humidity produced an uncomfortable mugginess. 
</P>
<P>
Candace Sims, 25, who works for Eastern Onion Singing Telegram Co., said her 
first job of the day was "awful" in the heat: dressed in a bright pink, furry 
gorilla suit, she had to sing and dance at a gas station in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"It was this guy's birthday," she said. "I was trying to look good and all, but 
my makeup was melting. I was roasting. I had to jump around with my tambourine 
while I sang and played the kazoo. Then I had to do the bunny hop." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after she got back into her car, Sims pulled over and stripped down to 
the bathing suit she wore under the gorilla get-up. Then she bought a cherry 
slush for the ride home. 
</P>
<P>
Aspiring tanners who thought the heat might promise them a darker shade of 
brown were frustrated by the gray skies. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather's not too good for tanning," said Ellyn Horak, who works at Alpha 
Tan in San Clemente. "It's really humid and overcast. People are saying it's 
hot, but they're not getting any color laying out (in the sun). So they're 
coming in here." 
</P>
<P>
Others were unfazed by the heat. Paul Bottalico, 34, a salesman at a Santa Ana 
Honda dealership, said Friday's combination of heat and humidity was "nothing 
compared to Dallas, where I come from." 
</P>
<P>
By early evening Friday, Octave was about 360 miles south of Los Angeles and 
moving north at about 10 m.p.h., said Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the storm was expected to move onto land Saturday, Dittmann 
said. By that time, Octave will have lost most of its strength, but will trail 
with it cloudy skies and scattered rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
Left to its own devices, the storm probably would have moved out to sea and 
died without bringing rain to Southern California, Dittmann said. But a 
low-pressure system off the coast steered Octave to the east and kept up its 
strength, forcing the storm to disperse its moisture over land, Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though there were no smog alerts called Friday, the weather was enough to 
keep many seniors indoors. Some nursing homes restricted their residents' 
activities to protect their health. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Thomas, 74, who has lung cancer and lives in an Anaheim nursing home, said 
he usually sits outside on the deck, but Friday he watched soap operas inside 
because he "can't stand the heat or the smog." 
</P>
<P>
Mattie Crawford, 81, another resident of the home, said the heat doesn't bother 
her, but she stayed inside on her doctor's orders.

800 IN BREA TO BRAINSTORM REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
About 800 Brea community representatives will join city staff members and urban 
planners in brainstorming sessions to plan an extensive redevelopment of 
downtown Brea, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference announcing the redevelopment project, City Manager Frank 
Benest called the partnership between residents and professional planners 
unique and said it would "develop a downtown that isn't anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
The planning session will take place Oct. 6 and 7 and will culminate at the end 
of the year in a "vision for the downtown," Mayor Gene A. Leyton said. 
</P>
<P>
After coming up with ideas and proposed improvements, the city staff will meet 
with developers in a separate session Oct. 8 to determine which suggestions are 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff for Resources 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a community-driven project with a resource team (the city staff) to 
flush out the resources needed," Leyton said. 
</P>
<P>
A planned shopping center on the 22-acre site at the northwest corner of 
Imperial Highway and Brea Boulevard will be a main focus of the redevelopment 
plans, Benest said. Three "major developers who have shown they have a vision 
other than a cookie-cutter shopping center" will create proposals for the 
center based on the suggestions from the community, Leyton said. 
</P>
<P>
The companies will submit detailed master plans for the site that also allow 
for the future development of an additional 40 acres surrounding the shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow Co., Watt Community Developers and the Alexander Haggen Co. will 
compete for the project when they display their sketches and designs to the 
community on Nov. 29 in the theater of the Brea Civic and Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
Benest said a developer would be chosen near the end of the year in a "major 
economic decision" for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to develop a residential type of downtown in the midst of a busy 
industrial boulevard, Benest said. 
</P>
<P>
Community members and staff will discuss the possibilities of "multi-use 
buildings," which might include both residences and businesses, Benest said. 
</P>
<P>
The actual work is scheduled to begin in March or April of 1990, Leyton said.

CHAPMAN COLLEGE EVENT; 
</P>
<P>
CONFERENCE TO EXPLORE COUNTY HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The second annual Conference of Orange County History will be held at Chapman 
College Sept. 23 and 24, featuring discussions on traditional subjects of 
archeology and preservation as well as on such contemporary topics as the 
history of gays and ethnic groups in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The conference's highlight will be a dinner of traditional Spanish-Mexican food 
at the Mission San Juan Capistrano. The dinner will include tortillas, prepared 
by the participants, baked in the mission's clay ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Conference organizers said they expect about 750 people to attend, a 50% 
increase over last year's conference at Chapman, which was the largest history 
conference gathering in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The panel discussions will include presentations on archeology, video history, 
library archives, businesses, labor, historical preservation and railroads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gentry to Chair Panel 
</P>
<P>
A panel will also be chaired by Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry on the 
history of gays in Orange County. Members of the Gay and Lesbian History 
Project of Orange County will participate. 
</P>
<P>
Other sessions will look at the history in the county of American Indians, 
Southeast Asians, Latinos and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Apodaca, curator of folk art at Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, said his panel 
will examine the American Indians of Orange County. Indians have often been 
ignored in books and articles about Orange County history, he said at a press 
conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the conference will examine archeology along the path of the 
planned San Joaquin Hills toll road and explore the history of Laguna Beach, 
Mission San Juan Capistrano, the Irvine Coast, Bolsa Chica and Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks Cost $15 
</P>
<P>
The panel discussions will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sept. 23, and from 
1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Sept. 24. Cost is $15, including a sack lunch, for advance 
registration. Registration at the door will begin at 7:30 a.m. and will cost 
$20. 
</P>
<P>
The conference will move to the mission at 6 p.m. Saturday, beginning with 
docent tours of the grounds, the church and the museum. "Living history 
players" will re-enact scenes of early mission life. 
</P>
<P>
A dinner of tamales, carnitas, traditional beans, rice, tortillas and dessert 
will be served beginning at 7 p.m., with the guests helping to prepare their 
own food. Pamela Hallen Gibson, president of the San Juan Capistrano Historical 
Society, will speak at 8:30 on "little-known facts" about the mission. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner, presented with the assistance of San Juan Capistrano restaurants, 
will cost $27. Preregistration and additional information about the conference 
can be obtained from the history department at Chapman College in Orange.

CRASH PROMPTS BUENA PARK MAYOR TO CALL FOR STRICTER CONTROLS ON FULLERTON 
FLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH CARPENTIER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buena Park Mayor Donna L. Chessen on Friday called for stricter controls 
regulating flights from Fullerton Municipal Airport, saying a rash of plane 
crashes has left residents living in "a nightmare" of fear. 
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to become more populated, and our residents don't deserve 
this," Chessen said. "It comes close to being an earthquake, but it is actually 
worse in one respect. You can't prepare for it. It's a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Joined at a press conference by City Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune, Chessen 
expressed concern over a series of accidents involving small airplanes flying 
in and out of the Fullerton airport. 
</P>
<P>
The latest accident came Wednesday shortly before 4:30 p.m. when a two-seat 
Cessna 152, carrying an instructor and a student pilot, lost power about a 
minute after takeoff and crashed at the intersection of Artesia Boulevard and 
Darlington Street in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
The student pilot, Moyra Pimm, 29, of Great Britain, remained in critical but 
stable condition Friday at UCI Medical Center with burns over 50% of her body. 
The instructor, Bradley Pearce, 28, of Garden Grove, was treated for burns on 
his arm and released. 
</P>
<P>
The accident is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the third plane crash to occur in Buena Park since December, and the 
11th since 1966," Chessen said. "And because of the flight pattern, it is more 
likely that a crash will occur in our city than in Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
While stopping short of calling for the Fullerton airport to be closed, Chessen 
nevertheless expressed outrage over the number of accidents and called on 
Fullerton officials to work with the Federal Aviation Administration to review 
airport procedures to make sure everything is being done to prevent more 
accidents from happening. 
</P>
<P>
Chessen said she had directed the city staff to research and inquire into the 
FAA's methods and policies to find a way the agency can better regulate flights 
at the Fullerton airport. 
</P>
<P>
"While Buena Park realizes dealing with a huge federal entity such as the FAA 
is no small task, we believe it is our responsibility to the residents and 
businesses in Buena Park to do all we can to ensure their safety." 
</P>
<P>
As an example of what can be done, Chessen noted that the city of San Diego 
prohibits evening "touch and go" landing practices, the standard learning 
technique used most frequently by student pilots. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that occupants of the last two plane crashes in Buena Park were 
students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Joining a chorus of other Buena Park officials, Councilwoman McCune called on 
the Fullerton Municipal Airport to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Fullerton's City Council does not care about us," McCune said. "They have not 
done one thing to show any concern. I want to see Fullerton airport closed 
down, but at the very minimum, they should at least change the flight pattern." 
</P>
<P>
McCune said the city would like the FAA to impose stricter regulations 
regarding touch-and-go landings and look into the possibility of prohibiting 
student pilots from using the airport. She also complained that planes 
continually fly too low in approaching and leaving the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we are reaching a day when stronger controls should be made in regard to 
pleasure flying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chessen noted that some critics had proposed that Buena Park change its zoning 
laws "and move people out from under the flight pattern of the airport." She 
called that "an impossible option with thousands of people, homes and 
businesses located adjacent to the airport." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton officials said earlier they were satisfied with the facility's 
operation, with City Manager William C. Winter describing the airport as "a 
very safe place. The record of incidents does not reflect an alarming 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Paoli, chairwoman of Fullerton's Airport Users Task Force and a pilot 
for two decades, called the reaction by Buena Park officials unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish people would try to step out of themselves a little bit and realize the 
airport is not unleashing an atom bomb on Buena Park," she said.

SON SUES INS IN FATAL STROKE OF MOTHER, 66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The son of a Santa Ana woman who suffered a fatal stroke while being 
interrogated by an immigration agent at Los Angeles International Airport has 
filed a federal lawsuit against the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Shih Tsung Hwang, a U.S. citizen and orthopedic surgeon, claims his 
mother, Chen Seu-Ing Hwang, 66, died because of "the harassment and unnecessary 
pressure" put on her by the INS agent. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang is asking for $1.5 million for his mother's estate and $1.5 million for 
himself. The suit was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Kice, an INS spokeswoman, said the agency has no comment on Hwang's 
lawsuit because it is pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Resident 
</P>
<P>
Hwang, who was a legal resident of the United States, arrived at the airport 
Sept. 17, 1987, on a flight from Taipei, Taiwan, said Howard Hom, an attorney 
representing the son. 
</P>
<P>
She was returning from a stay of almost a year in Taiwan, where she went to 
handle her husband's estate after he died on a visit to Taiwan, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, the immigration agent, identified as Inspector Craig 
Porter, "interrogated her at length and tried to get her to admit she was not a 
United States resident and had been away more than a year." A resident alien 
forfeits his or her permit, or "green card," if abroad 12 months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
"But she wasn't gone longer than 12 months and although she could not 
communicate in English, her relatives in Taiwan had written a note explaining 
the purpose of her trip," Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issued Warning 
</P>
<P>
"After being unable to extract those false admissions from Mrs. Hwang, (the 
agent) informed Mrs. Hwang that if she went back to Taiwan, he would confiscate 
her green card," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The agent got a Japan Airlines employee to help interpret for Hwang. But, the 
suit alleges, Porter then asked Hwang if she would be going back to Taiwan at 
any time in the future. When she replied she would, he repeated his threat, the 
suit said. At that moment, she collapsed and suffered the stroke, the suit 
said.

MISTAKES ARE FATAL TO EDISON; 
</P>
<P>
CAPISTRANO VALLEY'S DEFENSE FORCES SIX FUMBLES IN 37-10 ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capistrano Valley's defense sacked, harried, rushed and intercepted Edison 
quarterback Donnie Smith while defeating the Chargers, 37-10, Friday night in 
front of 1,400 at Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Psaros and Dave Josker each sacked Smith twice. Tackle Mike Christian and 
linebacker Motor Mosebrook, whose engine was in high gear, also dominated 
defensively for the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were good. They had eight starters back on defense," Edison Coach 
Dave White said. "I told the kids (Capistrano) might be the best defense they 
would face all year." 
</P>
<P>
White was disappointed in his team's intensity, saying, "We played with no 
emotion. They were a real good football team that came to play and we were an 
average football team that didn't come to play. Maybe now people will stop 
saying we're number two (in Division I)." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, already lacking in depth, were without wide receiver/defensive 
back Mike Cunningham and center David Rider, who were injured in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Jeff Aselin, filling in at center, and Smith had trouble on the snaps, 
with Smith bobbling the ball numerous times, and fumbling it three times. The 
Chargers had a total of six fumbles. Capistrano Valley recovered two of them. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano's Chris Tarnowski recovered one of the fumbles at the Edison 42 late 
in the first quarter. After a four-yard run by Paul Shaheen and a 29-yard pass 
from Tony Solliday to Dan Zamora, Shaheen ran 25 yards for a touchdown to put 
Capistrano Valley ahead, 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, the Cougars moved the ball freely with the help of a few key 
Edison penalties sustaining them whenever their drives came close to faltering. 
They scored on their first three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Solliday completed 11 of 20 passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns. Zamora was 
on the receiving end of five of them for 59 yards and a touchdown. Dave Poltl 
caught three passes for 59 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton was surprised his team dominated. "We were 
very fortunate to jump out in the lead like we did and score as quickly as we 
did. I knew we were quick and had some team speed, but I did not know how well 
we would match up with their size and running game." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley limited running back Shane Sherman to 65 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Edison quarterback Smith rushed for minus 30 yards in nine carries. He 
completed 18 of 30 passes for 194 yards, one touchdown and was intercepted 
once. 
</P>
<P>
To add insult to injury, the Edison players and coaches had their clothing 
stolen from the visitors' locker room at Capistrano Valley sometime during the 
second half. "We already lost our tails tonight, then we lost everything in the 
locker room," White said. "We got everything ripped off. We lost all our 
jewelry, rings, money, wallets. It was all there at halftime."

BALANCE KEYS ESTANCIA VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People know the Estancia High School football team can run the ball. Friday 
night the Eagles showed they could kick it, too, in a 26-7 victory over Laguna 
Hills at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Senior tailback Josh Wojtkiewicz carried the ball 17 times for 138 yards and 
two touchdowns. His running mate, senior Gary Burrows had 69 yards on 14 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
But Estancia (2-0) also benefitted from kicker Alex Vazquez and the passing of 
senior quarterback Danny Ucker. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez had two 23-yard field goals and two extra points and Ucker completed 14 
of 17 passes for 131 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal this year was to have a balanced attack," said Estancia Coach John 
Liebengood. "That way, people can't key on (Burrows) and (Wojtkiewicz)." 
</P>
<P>
Credit also goes to the Estancia defense. It shut down Laguna Hills most of the 
night with one mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills tailback Darrin Chapman broke loose on a trap up the middle and 
dashed 71 yards for the loser's only score early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given up seven points in two games, so I think you could say our defense 
is strong," said Liebengood. "Except for that trap, we stopped them all night."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Gaw scored three touchdowns to lead Mission Viejo High School to a 56-6 
nonleague victory over University Friday night at Irvine Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Gaw rushed for 68 yards in nine carries for the county's No. 2 ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (2-0) jumped out to a 42-0 lead in the second quarter and breezed 
the rest of the way against University, which fumbled eight times and lost 
possession on six of them. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, which has outscored its first two opponents, 98-6, also got an 
excellent effort from Jason Pappas, who rushed for 76 yards in 11 carries and 
scored one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo quarterback Don Disbro, who came out of the game in the second 
quarter, completed four of eight passes for 45 yards and rushed for 42 yards in 
five carries. Teammate Ryan Darke rushed for 59 yards in five carries and also

FOR LOARA, THIS VICTORY OVER ANAHEIM IS A SNAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pity Anaheim High School punter Abe Gomez. From the first snap he took on 
Friday night, he was on the run. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Gomez had controlled the high snap from center, a pack of Loara 
defenders was upon him and his kick was not so much blocked as it was 
smothered. 
</P>
<P>
"I just looked back and I saw everybody (coming after me)," Gomez said. "It was 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez' terror was representative of Anaheim's night, as Loara (2-0) overwhelmed 
the Colonists 36-7 in a nonleague game at Glover Stadium in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
And it got worse for Gomez, who spent much of the night chasing errant snaps 
and attempting to elude Loara rushers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the blocked punt, which led to the first Loara touchdown, Gomez had two 
snaps clear his outstretched arms. The first time, in the first half, Gomez 
managed to get off a short, bounding kick. But the second time, in the fourth 
quarter, he was tackled in the end zone for a safety, which provided Loara's 
last two points. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a touchdown pass on a fake field-goal attempt at the end of the 
first half, Anaheim (0-2) was moribund on offense. Halfback Sammy Serna 
completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to fullback Ernie Akau, fooling the Loara 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
But little else fooled any Saxon defenders. Anaheim's running plays were 
stuffed and Colonist quarterback Robert Jones was harassed into two second-half 
interceptions, both of which were returned for touchdowns by Greg Ramsey and 
Brett Banta. 
</P>
<P>
Loara's offense had taken a 21-0 lead in the first half behind the running of 
tailback Coy Collins and quarterback Sean Conner. Collins gained most of the 
Saxon yards in the half, scoring on runs of 1 and 34 yards. Conner kept the 
ball on the option and scored after a 45-yard run.

CANYON COMES BACK TO EARTH IN 14-3 LOSS TO DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS KAISER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The honeymoon is over for the Canyon High School football team. 
</P>
<P>
After snapping a 17-game losing streak with a victory over Corona last week, 
the Comanches were beaten by the Diamond Bar Brahmas, 14-3, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, it was a stingy Diamond Bar defense that kept Canyon from winning their 
second in a row. Canyon quarterback Chuck Nickerson was sacked seven times for 
38 yards in losses, and the Brahmas secondary wasn't any kinder. They 
intercepted Nickerson twice and covered his receivers so tightly he completed 
just two of eight passes. 
</P>
<P>
"We just made a lot of mistakes . . . self-destruction," Canyon coach Loren 
Shumer said. "We couldn't give the quarterback enough time. Then when we did, 
he couldn't find his receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just going to have to improve our passing game or we're going to face 
9- and 10-man fronts all season. They (Diamond Bar, 2-0) sent a lot of people 
and we just couldn't block them." 
</P>
<P>
The Comanches (1-1) were more successful rushing, however. They gained 115 
yards, with sophomore running back Jeff Brunswig getting 85 of them in 20 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't enough to produce any touchdowns, though. And it also wasn't enough 
to offset Diamond Bar quarterback Tito Quiles (8 of 15 for 95 yards) -- who 
kept the offense moving at just the right times -- and touchdowns by running 
backs Mike Jones and Frank Delgadillo. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's only score was a 24-yard field goal by Chris Snitko with 3:42 
remaining in the first quarter. And that was the only score by either team 
until Delgadillo scored from two yards out late in the third quarter.

RIDDLE RUNS RANCHO ALAMITOS TO 9-7 VICTORY OVER COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Riddle rushed for 317 yards in 37 carries to lead Rancho Alamitos High 
School to a 9-7 victory over Costa Mesa in a nonleague football game Friday at 
Garden Grove High School. 
</P>
<P>
Riddle scored Rancho Alamitos' only touchdown on a 95-yard run in the first 
quarter. Playing inside linebacker, he also gave Rancho Alamitos two points 
with a fourth-quarter safety. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a 48-yard run called back because of holding in the third quarter," 
Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller said. "It's too bad we had so much called 
back or he could have had 400 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa scored on a 56-yard pass from Duby Ostina to David Phillips in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In other nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 21, Whittier 0 -- The Indians (2-0) scored two first-quarter 
touchdowns and used a strong defensive effort in front of 2,100 at Cal High. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the first quarter, Fullerton fullback Marcus Roberson ran 75 yards 
with a short pass from Rene Arias for the first touchdown. Later in the first 
quarter, tailback Chris Escalera ran five yards on an option play for the 
second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Arias completed a three-yard pass to Bobby Patel for the final score midway 
through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The defense "did a superb job stopping the run all night long," Fullerton Coach 
Reginald Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Troy 46, El Dorado 0 -- Chad Brasington scored three touchdowns to lead the 
Warriors (2-0) in front of 2,000 at Fullerton High School. Brasington scored on 
runs of 35, 11 and four yards and finished with 75 yards rushing. Quarterback 
Greg Windle threw a pair of touchdown passes, both to wide receiver Ryan 
Russell. Windle connected with Russell on a 30-yard touchdown pass in the first 
quarter. The two teamed again on a 17-yard scoring play in the second quarter. 
Eldon Davis also scored two touchdowns on runs of one and four yards. Troy 
forced seven turnovers in posting its second consecutive shutout. El Dorado is 
0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 20, Barstow 6 -- Senior tailback Lance Brown ran for two touchdowns 
at Valencia High School. Brown finished with 128 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Mayfair 26, Garden Grove 9 -- Quarterback David Partin completed five of 15 
passes for 69 yards and two touchdowns and fullback Marvin Morton rushed for 
102 yards in 18 carries as Mayfair won its second consecutive game. Garden 
Grove is 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut 20, Magnolia 9 -- Linebacker Dave Flores, a 5-foot-5, 150-pound junior, 
led a stingy Mustang defense with a 85-yard interception return for a 
first-quarter touchdown to pace the visitors in a nonleague game at Western 
High School. Flores also had a fumble recovery as the Mustangs held Magnolia to 
minus 35 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
For the Sentinels (0-2), senior running back caught four passes for 97 yards 
and Magnolia's lone touchdown. Magnolia quarterback Elliott Parker was nine of 
16 for 168 yards, but had two interceptions, including the one by Flores. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, visiting Walnut (1-1) featured a balanced rushing attack which ran 
up 183 yards and saw four players gain more than 40 yards apiece. Corona del 
Mar 9, Marina 0 -- Fullback Jerrott Willard caught a 10-yard touchdown pass 
from quarterback Todd Kehrli and kicked a 44-yard field goal to account for all 
of Corona del Mar's scoring at Davidson Field. 
</P>
<P>
In eight-man nonleague football: 
</P>
<P>
Claremont-Garden Grove 34, Ambassador Baptist 8 -- Eric Tessaorre scored three 
touchdowns and had nine rushes for 82 yards to lead visiting Claremont. 
Claremont was in control the whole way and had a 26-0 lead at halftime.

SANTA MARGARITA SHUTS OUT JURUPA VALLEY FOR FIRST WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Margarita High School won its first varsity football game on Friday, a 
41-0 victory over Jurupa Valley in front of about 1,200 spectators at 
Saddleback College Field. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita (1-1) lost its first varsity game last week, to Trabuco Hills, 
50-14. This is the third year the school has been open and it has yet to have a 
senior class. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore running back Josh Ireland and junior quarterback Trevor Yankoff 
proved to be enough offense for Santa Margarita, playing only the first half 
because of the lopsided score. Santa Margarita led, 31-0, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland scored two touchdowns, one on a 77-yard run in the second quarter. 
Yankoff completed five of eight passes for 136 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita led 7-0 at the end of the first quarter on Ireland's one-yard 
run and put the game away with 24 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The first score came on a 50-yard pass reception by Eric Brown. Ireland's 
77-yard run, a 32-yard field goal by Travis Lucero, and Louis Pavlovich's 
20-yard run after recovering a fumble completed the second-quarter scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita's final 10 points came in the third quarter on a one-yard run 
by Ryan Zalta and Lucero's 37-yard field goal. VINCE AGUL

MADISON RALLY TOO MUCH FOR SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Clemente High School football team outplayed visiting San Diego Madison 
for three quarters, but was itself outplayed in the fourth and ended up on the 
short end of a 20-10 score in front of about 1,000 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons (0-2) were in front, 10-6, at the half, but after a scoreless third 
quarter, they gave up two touchdowns to the Warhawks (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of the quarter, quarterback Mike Jones passed 32 yards to 
James Cole for a 13-10 lead. The play completed a 61-yard, five-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Warhawks put the game out of reach with a 26-yard touchdown run by fullback 
Bryant Craig with 1:21 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Madison scored first on Cole's 60-yard interception return of a Mario Watkins 
pass midway through the first quarter. The conversion try failed and Madison 
led, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was all San Clemente until halftime. Triton fullback Larry Brophy tied 
the game on the next play from scrimmage, scoring on an 80-yard run up the 
middle. A successful conversion gave San Clemente a 7-6 lead. Derek Marshall's 
39-yard field goal gave the Tritons a 10-7 lead at the intermission.

FEDERAL LAWSUIT CLAIMS EX-LINCOLN S&amp;L OFFICIALS SCHEMED TO DIVERT FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators filed a lawsuit Friday in Phoenix charging that the former 
operators of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan devised a racketeering 
scheme to siphon $1.1 billion in federally insured deposits from the 
now-insolvent thrift for their own use. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, is the largest ever filed against 
directors and officers of failed institutions. With punitive damages and 
trebling provisions under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act, the government is seeking to recover up to $2.4 billion from 
the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts estimated that Lincoln's collapse will cost taxpayers up to 
$2.5 billion, which would make it the costliest S&amp;L failure in history. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental 
Corp., and other executives bought the S&amp;L in 1984 and began "to divert . . 
. Lincoln's deposits and assets to themselves" through a wide range of 
"illegal, fraudulent and imprudent acts," including false and misleading 
statements to regulators, forgery and concealment of illegal cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
The racketeering scheme was devised to fuel the operation's "speculative" 
business ventures, from securities trading to real estate deals, the suit said. 
And to further the scheme, the suit claims, the defendants "engaged in a 
pattern of deception to mask prohibited and sham transactions from regulatory 
scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
The suit also seeks to freeze the assets of Keating, who is a multimillionaire, 
and others, allowing each to live on $3,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Keating was out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Phoenix-based American Continental called the racketeering charges 
"mean-spirited" on the part of regulators and denied that Keating and the other 
36 defendants were liable for any of the 14 claims made in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no surprises here," said Melvin A. McDonald, a lawyer for the 
company, about the allegations. "This is the same old wine in the same old 
bottles -- the same information regulators have had for years. They're just 
trying to put new labels on the bottles." 
</P>
<P>
The suit stemmed from an in-depth investigation by regulators, said Alan 
Whitney, spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures 
deposits at Lincoln. "We have a clear responsibility to take legal action where 
appropriate to reduce any losses to American taxpayers growing out of 
fraudulent financial activity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental filed 
for bankruptcy. Regulators declared the S&amp;L insolvent on Aug. 2 after 
disclosing $788 million in losses in the second quarter, which ended June 30, 
and put Lincoln in receivership. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is the first major legal action brought by the Resolution Trust Corp. 
since it was created last month by a new federal law to handle failed banks and 
thrifts. The RTC brought the suit as receiver for Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges four RICO violations and three violations of Arizona's 
racketeering laws against Keating and six executives, including his son and two 
sons-in-law. An additional seven allegations accuse the defendants -- 20 
individuals and 17 companies -- of fraud, conspiracy, negligence and violations 
of regulatory laws. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants also include William J. Keating, a former congressman and former 
publisher of the Cincinnati Enquirer. He is Charles Keating's brother. Their 
spouses and those of several other defendants were also named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is in bankruptcy, American Continental itself was not named as a 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and the other defendants are accused of wrongdoing in transactions 
involving high-yield corporate securities known as junk bonds, corporate stock 
bought by American Continental's employee stock ownership plan, land sold to 
related parties allegedly for above-market prices and straw borrowers and straw 
purchasers allegedly used to avoid direct investment regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also claims that American Continental wrongly appropriated money from 
Lincoln to pay corporate taxes, resulting in a $125-million loss of income to 
the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the alleged wrongdoing, the suit said, was the result of Keating's 
effort to get around federal regulations that limited the amount of money that 
Lincoln could use to take ownership positions in numerous investments, such as 
real estate and securities. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has been an outspoken critic of the limitations on direct investments 
and has battled with regulators over various rules almost since American 
Continental bought Lincoln in February, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid complying with the limitations, the suit said, Keating and others 
disguised the investments as loans or sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manipulation Alleged 
</P>
<P>
In one example cited in the suit, Keating and others sold a residential 
development to R.A. Homes in Phoenix. The transaction was financed through 
Lincoln and, despite the sale, Keating entities maintained control over the 
development. R.A. Homes is operated by Ron Ober, who has been the campaign 
manager for three election campaigns of Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to real estate transactions, the suit alleges, the defendants 
manipulated a number of stock sales and purchases that will result in more than 
$22 million in damages to Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In one transaction, the defendants allegedly caused Lincoln to sell stock in 
Memorex International to a third party for $1 million -- after the investment 
banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert sent a letter saying the stock was worth 
$2.8 million. The third party soon sold the stock to American Continental for 
$2 million, and the company later sold the stock at its market value -- $13.3 
million. The suit claims that the company misappropriated $11.3 million in 
profits that should have gone to Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Insider Loans 
</P>
<P>
And the defendants also tried to avoid regulations limiting loans to insiders, 
the suit said. The primary example involved funds that Lincoln made available 
to Southmark Corp. in Dallas and its subsidiaries and about $35 million in 
loans that Southmark's thrift subsidiary, San Jacinto Savings &amp; Loan, made 
to a Keating-led partnership that owns the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was angered that the suit named the spouses of some American 
Continental executives as defendants. Though not named as racketeering 
defendants, he said, the spouses named in the suit suffer the same "powerful" 
stigma that attaches to other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see racketeering charges against family members, I think it's being 
used to break Keating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freeze on Assets 
</P>
<P>
Racketeering claims also may prevent the defendants from turning to their 
corporate insurance policy for their legal defense and any damages, he said. 
And any freeze on assets could hinder Keating and other defendants from hiring 
effective counsel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several sources said regulators had been debating internally for a month about 
whether to bring racketeering claims and seek to recover damages from Keating's 
assets or sue only for fraud and work out a more certain settlement with the 
insurance carrier covering director and officer liability. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also could bolster ongoing investigations by the FBI and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. The FBI's criminal investigation, which 
started in Los Angeles, has been transferred to Phoenix because Lincoln's 
assets were primarily in Arizona property and the S&amp;L's investments were 
overseen by American Continental management. The SEC has been probing 
allegations of securities law violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senators Intervened 
</P>
<P>
The racketeering claims against Keating also may further blacken the eyes of 
five senators, including DeConcini and Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who made 
inquiries on his behalf with regulators in the past. None of the legislators 
were mentioned in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his executives contributed at least $300,000 to election campaigns 
of the senators and, at Cranston's request, gave an additional $850,000 to 
three nonpartisan voter registration groups, one of which was formed by 
Cranston's son. 
</P>
<P>
The senators twice intervened at Keating's behest two years ago to question 
regulators about an unusually long financial examination of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A RECENT HISTORY OF LINCOLN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN 
</P>
<P>
February, 1984: American Continental Corp., a Phoenix-based real estate 
development company headed by Charles H. Keating Jr., purchases Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan in Irvine for $51 million. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1986: The Federal Home Loan Bank Board begins a lengthy audit of 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1986: American Continental wins approval from the California 
Department of Corporations to sell subordinated debentures -- essentially 
corporate IOUs -- at Lincoln's 29 branches in Southern California. Over the 
next two years, some 22,000 people buy nearly $200 million in debentures. 
</P>
<P>
April, 1987: Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John 
McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) meet privately with Edwin J. Gray, 
then the bank board's chairman. They question the unprecedented length of the 
Lincoln examination and a proposed regulation that would hinder Lincoln's 
operations. A week later, the senators, joined by Sen. Donald Riegle (D-Mich.), 
question bank board examiners about the audit. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1988: Lincoln Savings settles its long-running dispute with thrift 
regulators by agreeing to raise up to $160 million in new capital. In response 
to Lincoln's request that oversight of the S&amp;L be transferred to another 
field office, the bank board's main office in Washington took over supervision 
from San Francisco. The bank board immediately initiates a new audit. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1988: The California Department of Corporations approves more sales of 
debentures despite objections from the California Department of Savings and 
Loan. A short time later, the thrift regulatory agency refuses to allow the 
company to sell the bonds at Lincoln branches. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1988: American Continental agrees to sell Lincoln to a Southern 
California investment group headed by longtime industry executive Spencer Scott 
in a stock transaction valued at $288.75 million. Soon after the agreement is 
announced, federal regulators claim that Lincoln does not have enough capital 
to support its operations and should stop all non-traditional S&amp;L 
activities until they can review the sale. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1989: After the sales agreement for Scott's group expires in February, a 
new group of investors, headed by former U.S. Rep. John Rousselot, reaches a 
tentative agreement to buy Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
April 13, 1989: American Continental files for protection from creditors under 
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. In an unusual twist, it also puts 11 
Lincoln subsidiaries in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
April 14, 1989: The bank board seizes Lincoln, saying its parent firm was 
operating it unsafely, and immediately asks the FBI to investigate allegations 
of criminal activity that may have caused the S&amp;L's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
August, 1989: Regulators announce that Lincoln lost $788 million in the second 
quarter and declare Lincoln insolvent. Regulators put it in receivership, 
cutting off all rights of owners and debt holders to S&amp;L assets. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 15, 1989: Regulators sue Keating and other American Continental directors 
and officers in a racketeering suit that seeks $1.2 billion in damages, the 
largest amount ever sought by regulators in litigation over a failed S&amp;L.

BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS PLANS TO ELIMINATE 150 POSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a worldwide slump in government spending on medical research programs, 
Beckman Instruments said Thursday it will eliminate about 150 positions, or 2% 
of its 7,400 jobs, by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
All the cuts will be in the company's bioanalytical group, which produces 
esoteric instruments used largely in university and government medical and 
biological research programs. In addition, the approximately 2,850 remaining 
employees of the group will be required to take five days of vacation or unpaid 
furlough by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman, based in Fullerton, has facilities throughout Europe and Asia as well 
as in the United States. The job cuts "will be spread around all our facilities 
and will be across the board, including salaried and hourly people," 
spokeswoman Elke Eastman said. About 2,400 employees work in Orange County, but 
Eastman was unable to say how many of them work in the bioanalytical group. 
</P>
<P>
She said that some of the jobs will be eliminated through normal attrition but 
that most will be trimmed in layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Steffenhagen, director of investor relations for Beckman, said the 
bioanalytical group is expected to show a drop in sales this year. 
Traditionally, the group accounts for about half of Beckman's total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported sales of $770 million for 1988 and earnings of $42.5 
million. For the first six months of 1989, the company reported sales of $399.5 
million, up 5% from a year earliers, and unchanged earnings of $22.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman's diagnostic instruments group, however, has posted strong sales growth 
this year, Steffenhagen said, and as a result the company's total sales "will 
show modest growth." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement Friday, Louis T. Rosso, Beckman's chairman and 
president, said the conditions affecting the company's bioanalytical group 
reflect "a worldwide phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
Steffenhagen said Beckman has tracked significant declines in government grants 
to biomedical research programs in the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, 
China and West Germany in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Yost, an Atlanta-based health supplies industry analyst with 
Interstate/Johnson Lane, said a variety of factors, including currency 
fluctuations and the soaring cost of medical care, have caused many governments 
to trim spending on health research as they struggle to balance their budgets.

GASTRONOMES' DREAM;

<P>
TRUE BOUILLABAISSE ARRIVES FOR BRIEF STAY AT LE MERIDIEN HOTEL WITH FISH FLOWN 
IN FROM MEDITERRANEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was exactly 20 years ago that I experienced my first bouillabaisse, the 
Provencal fish soup that gastronomes everywhere dream about. I wandered the 
docks of Marseille until I found the grubbiest fishmonger's shack advertising 
the dish, and there experienced one of the most memorable meals of my life. 
Platters and platters of whole fish came out of the kitchen, along with a broth 
that surpassed anything I had ever tasted. Little did I realize that it would 
be 20 years before I had the dish again. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that a true bouillabaisse is virtually impossible to prepare away from 
the Mediterranean does not deter countless American chefs from trying to 
reproduce it, despite the lack of rascasse, vive (weever), rouget (red mullet), 
and other fish that the recipe requires. American chefs throw just about 
anything into their stock pots, even shellfish, a departure that borders on 
blasphemy. It makes me redder than a lobster to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
This week, thanks to Le Meridien Hotel, Newport Beach's "SeaFest" and Chef 
Sylvan DuParc of the Carlton Hotel in Cannes, you can have a real bouillabaisse 
without going to the south of France. Cafe Fleuri in Le Meridien will be 
preparing the dish throughout this week at dinner time, and Chef DuParc is 
having the fish flown in from France on a daily basis, using the exact recipe 
from his own kitchen. It's fabulous, and you even get the recipe with the 
dinner. Good luck doing it at home. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to eat it. You will be served a large soup bowl filled with a rich, 
ruddy, fennel and saffron infused broth, on top of which are steaming chunks of 
white fish, angler fish, John Dory, spiny lobster (the one shellfish that can 
be included), conger eel, and the rascasse, vive and rouget. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside, on small plates, are croutons waiting to be smothered in rouille (a 
garlic and red pepper mayonnaise) and mounds of finely grated Gruyere cheese. 
You plunge the doctored croutons into the soup bowl, spoon up a big chunk of 
fish, and voila!, you're an honorary Marseillaise. It's a taste sensation 
you'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>
Should you run out, waiters are at the ready to ladle more of Chef DuParc's 
nectar-like broth into your bowl. There are also several Provencal 
accompaniments to complement the meal. Begin with tapenade, an anchovy and 
olive puree, here served with a platter of baby vegetables for dipping. End the 
meal with a clafouti aux prunes (a custardy fruit tart made with mirabelles -- 
the irresistible little yellow plums that grow everywhere in rural France). A 
Provencale rose wine will make a charming compliment. 
</P>
<P>
The bouillabaisse will be available for dinner only from today until Friday. 
The price is $30, and the Cafe Fleuri is in Le Meridien Hotel, 4500 MacArthur 
Blvd., Newport Beach. For reservations call (714) 476-2001.

WHAT HE SAW IN LAGUNA CANYON'S 'TELL' TOLD HIM A THING OR TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Calendar's two-page laudatory but very questionable coverage of 
Laguna Canyon's "The Tell" (Sept. 3), I revisited the site just to make certain 
my eyes hadn't deceived me. 
</P>
<P>
Second time around, you can ignore the sheer ugliness of that 600-foot strip of 
plywood pictorial bologna and the rubbish about it being "poetry" or "depicting 
family life as it is now" and concentrate on the anti-development statement 
"The Tell" is supposed to be making. 
</P>
<P>
Do photos of bikini bottoms and Coke stands, Barbara Walters and Chinese dogs 
make a forceful statement about the necessity to preserve the beauty of Laguna 
Canyon? I think your reporter wore rose-colored glasses or maybe his lemonade 
was spiked by the photographer-promoters. 
</P>
<P>
He made no mention of the destruction of the land or the tearing up of animal 
habitat. The duped city, of course, first began that damage with earthmoving 
equipment, both machine and man-hours paid for by taxes. The city fathers (and 
mothers) who approved this venture, committing resources to it, should have 
their heads examined. 
</P>
<P>
In a community where you almost have to file an environmental impact report to 
put out a garbage can, I doubt an EIR was even considered for this canyon rape 
job of which an admitted goal is a Guinness record. 
</P>
<P>
Mention was made of a $10,000 contribution by the Festival of Arts. To see what 
their $10,000 bought or wrought, I hope the committee members have driven out 
to "The Tell" -- unmistakably marked by a junked car half buried in sand. From 
there, the artistic endeavor goes down. The festival was likewise duped. 
</P>
<P>
The late Ansel Adams would rotate out of his grave at the sight of what has 
been done in the name of conservancy and photography.

WIDE-ANGLE WIZARD'S PHOTOS GO ON AND ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SILK, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This guy sure doesn't seem to be taking pictures. In fact, he looks downright 
suspicious, hanging out of a hovering helicopter and dangling sinister-looking 
contraptions over unsuspecting cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
Wide-angle wizard Michael Lawton, prince of the panoramas, is a master at 
producing startling photographs that encompass more of a scene than you can see 
with your own eyes. Right now, he's taking a circular portrait of Norwich, 
Conn. -- all of it -- that will make the city look like a planet floating in 
outer space. 
</P>
<P>
Up here in the blue sky 800 feet above Norwich, the Glastonbury, Conn., 
image-impresario is working color-coded ropes that control a fisheye camera as 
if it were a Buck Rogers-type marionette. (The only way to avoid including the 
helicopter in the finished picture is to suspend the camera on ropes that allow 
it to hang below the chopper. Once deployed, the camera is operated as if it 
were a puppet on strings.) 
</P>
<P>
Lawton's fisheye camera is a hatbox-size black cube bristling with black and 
silver cylinders. Hidden in the futuristic-looking gizmo are whirring 
gyroscopes (to stabilize the camera), a whooshing vacuum pump (to hold the film 
perfectly flat, thereby ensuring the sharpest possible image), purring motors 
(to advance the film after each picture is snapped) and a shutter that clicks 
each time Lawton presses the red button at the end of a long gray cord. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tackles 'Impossible' Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Lawton designed and built this crazy camera, and it's one in a long line of 
continually evolving prototypes that he has developed to tackle seemingly 
impossible photographic tasks, jobs like photographing a group of astronauts 
inside a claustrophobic space capsule or Fenway Park, showing both the cheering 
guy in the next seat and an outfielder snagging a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
To get those kinds of photographs, Lawton has designed and built cameras that 
take panoramic pictures (encompassing a full 360 degrees); fisheye cameras 
(whose omnivorous lenses swallow up 180-degree views and render them in 
circular images), and all sorts of esoteric picture-taking gear constructed by 
cannibalizing such traditional cameras as Nikons and Hasselblads. 
</P>
<P>
But, Lawton says, "I'm not building cameras; I'm building pictures." 
</P>
<P>
Each of his cameras has been designed to solve a specific photographic problem. 
He says he has developed a way to capture at least one photograph many consider 
impossible: the space shuttle engulfed in a shower of sparks as it re-enters 
the Earth's atmosphere. Astronauts have seen the glow, but they can't get a 
decent photo from inside the shuttle. "I've figured out a way to do it," Lawton 
says. "But that's my little secret." 
</P>
<P>
Lawton embarked on his singular photographic specialty with one of his first 
commercial assignments in the early '70s. Attempting to photograph a stadium in 
San Diego, he realized that it was impossible to get a good, undistorted 
picture showing the whole stadium on a single frame of film. He used three, 
then tinkered for hours in a darkroom to combine the separate negatives into a 
single, acceptable black and white print. Great, his client said, but wanted to 
see one in color. It took three months and $1,700 worth of retouching, but 
Lawton finally succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
He also realized that there had to be a better way to do this sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panoramic Photos 
</P>
<P>
Holing up with a model-making buddy, he went to work to develop a camera that 
could take panoramic pictures. "We kind of went nuts for three years," he says. 
The inventors were so single-minded that Lawton's thriving $40,000-a-year 
business nose-dived to one netting only $5,000 a year. But one day, the duo 
emerged from Lawton's garage with a piece of film worth processing -- a picture 
of the garage. At the photo lab, technicians were bowled over by seeing a 
continuous, seamless strip of film that showed the back and side walls inside 
the garage and the house across the street (seen through the open garage door) 
-- again and again. 
</P>
<P>
Lawton's invention was a vast improvement over commercially available panorama 
pictures: It included more of the scene and rendered razor-sharp images. 
</P>
<P>
Thus his career was launched. "I figured if I could excite people with the 
inside of my garage, what could I do with the Grand Canyon?" Lawton says. 
</P>
<P>
So he photographed the Grand Canyon, then the Golden Gate, then Yosemite, and 
on and on. He made and sold a slew of posters. The idea was to shoot the 
cliches with a new twist and prove to the publishing world the viability of 
panoramic photography. 
</P>
<P>
But all he met was resistance. The problem was that those long, skinny 
panoramics didn't work with any of the book or magazine formats in the '70s. To 
be best appreciated, the pictures have to be large. (Only in the past 10 years 
or so has National Geographic, for example, perfected the technology needed to 
publish multiple-page fold-out panoramic photographs on a regular basis.) 
</P>
<P>
Lawton, 46, spent the early part of his photographic career working as a 
free-lancer for National Geographic, but his association with the magazine 
ended before it was able to easily print the kind of pictures he makes best. 
Along the way, he also represented Canon cameras in a splashy ad campaign that 
capitalized on his photographic involvement with NASA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shoots Everything 
</P>
<P>
Today most of Lawton's work comes from developers and advertising agencies. 
Using his unique aerial fisheye and panoramic perspectives, or more traditional 
photo gear, Lawton shoots everything from junkyards to jungles. 
</P>
<P>
Such day-to-day work is merely a springboard to Lawton's real passions: 
exploration and adventure. Not only does his free-lance work pay the bills, but 
it also helps him hone his techniques. "I'm practicing with someone else's 
money," says Lawton of his free-lance assignments, "so when I'm out in the 
middle of the sticks I can come back with something." 
</P>
<P>
Lawton's last trip was to the Roraima complex in southeastern Venezuela, the 
alien landscape that inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tale of adventure 
entitled "The Lost World." 
</P>
<P>
Once at Autana, a mesa-like sandstone monolith, Lawton's group descended to 
explore a cave so vast that a daring helicopter pilot flew right into it. It 
was a luxurious sort of expedition -- twice the group sent helicopter pilots on 
a 2 1/2-hour mission for cold soft drinks and ice. There was an element of 
daring whimsy as well -- sky divers parachuted off the monolith's summit, 
plunging nearly a mile to reach the rain forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
Lawton returned with a series of stunning photographs he hopes will help focus 
attention on the endangered rain forests of the Amazon Basin. One of his 
mural-size prints shows a vast tract of tropical jungle punctuated by a tiny 
burned-out, chopped hole -- perhaps the beginning of a farm or ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to start to build upon that theme -- the destruction of the 
rain forest," Lawton says. "There are some estimates that there could be no 
rain forest in Venezuela in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Ancient cities also intrigue Lawton, who might like nothing better than the 
chance to do a high-altitude, infrared scan of, say, the Peruvian Amazon, in 
search of communities lost to time.

It has been said that one man's trash can be another man's treasure. The myriad 
of swap meets in Orange County lends some credence to that viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Vendors, open-air stalls, an array of colorful gadgets, eager-beaver shoppers, 
junk dealers, new and "previously owned" wares give the swap meet attendees an 
almost old-fashioned carnival atmosphere. Haggling is expected and is part of 
the excitement.

DISCOVERY: OLD WORLD VILLAGE

While Orange County is called home by people of many cultures, finding a 
European flavor in one stop is a tough order. But at Old World Village, at 
least, visitors can douse themselves in all things German -- from lederhosen to 
oompah music. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 families live in the village, above the shops and restaurants they 
own and operate. The ethnic charm of the place is abundant -- the cobbled 
walkways, the painted designs on the stores' exteriors, and the wooden signs 
hanging from wrought-iron posts above the doors. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of goods are available at the village's 30 or so shops, including 
German clothing and shoes, collectibles, crystal, porcelain, flowers and 
clocks. Two restaurants, a deli and a bakery tempt visitors with the smells of 
bratwurst, sauerkraut and other traditional German treats. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-room Hotel Europe can accommodate guests wishing to stay overnight. The 
150-seat Old World Village Chapel offers Sunday services in both English and 
German and is available for weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The village in Huntington Beach celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The 
year before the shops opened, the first Oktoberfest was held on the grounds. On 
an average weekend 500 people visit the village, but the crowds number in the 
thousands during Oktoberfest weekends. This year's Oktoberfest kicks off Sept. 
24 with a parade at 2 p.m. and will continue through Nov. 12. Music, dancing 
and lots of German food and beer will be available, which seems the perfect 
time to visit Old World Village and revel in German culture. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: Shops are open from 10 or 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. They will stay open 
later during Oktoberfest. 
</P>
<P>
Address: 7561 Center Ave., Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
Telephone: (714) 895-8020 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous information: Restaurants open daily at 11 a.m. There will be live 
entertainment during Oktoberfest (Sept. 24 through Nov. 12) performed by oompah 
bands from Germany. Oktoberfest hours are 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, 7 
to 11 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 6:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday and 
2 to 9 p.m. Sunday.

REPAIR COMPLAINTS -- GETTING THAT CAR ON THE ROAD AGAIN

Car repair customers who feel ripped off have a place to turn: the state Bureau 
of Automotive Repairs, created in March, 1972, with passage of the Automotive 
Repair Act. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the BAR generated $3.5 million for consumers from June, 1988, to 
May, 1989. In that time, the Orange County office received 1,800 complaints and 
assisted consumers in recovering $121,000 in refunds, rework on automobiles and 
bill adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
All new car dealers with a service department, automotive repair shops, 
independent automotive repair facilities, service stations (that do repair 
work, not just pump gas) and motorcycle shops are required by law to be 
licensed with the BAR. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County BAR has given licenses to 2,596 automotive repair shops, at a 
cost of $100 per year, and 735 smog certification centers at a cost of $10 per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
From July 1, 1988, to June 30, 1989, the BAR checked up on 1,300 smog stations 
by sending in cars with missing parts. They found 290 stations in violation and 
the owners were cited and fined. They also found 57 stations with second and 
third violations and five stations at fourth level violations. These five 
stations stand a good chance of loosing their license. Violators receive a $250 
fine for the first violation, $500 on the second violation and $1,500 on the 
third violation. A fourth violation can result in a hearing and the station can 
loose its license, but the licensee does have the right to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT: 
</P>
<P>
Automobile repair customers who take their car to a licensed automotive repair 
shop only to leave feeling that it was either not repaired, repaired 
incorrectly or subjected to unapproved repair work have a recourse -- filing a 
complaint against them to the Bureau of Automotive Repairs (BAR). 
</P>
<P>
To file a complaint: 
</P>
<P>
1. Call (800) 952-5210 or file in person to the local BAR office at 710 N. 
Euclid Ave., Suite 125, Anaheim, (714) 558-6414, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
2. Submit to the BAR all available paper work: invoices, written estimates, 
warranties, guarantees, bill of sale, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The formal signed complaint along with any other paper work will be turned over 
to a complaint handler, who determines if the Automotive Repair Act has been 
violated in any way. If so, the two parties try to work out an amicable 
agreement with the complaint handler as intermediary. If no agreement is 
reached, a civil suit is filed.

TAXIDERMISTS HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF

<P>
The art of taxidermy is a technique for preserving and showing animals as they 
appeared when they were alive. It requires a knowledge of anatomy, sculpture, 
tanning, dyeing, painting and natural history. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County at one time had enough professional taxidermists to require 
counting with both hands. Today there are just three. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be a trend in bereaved pet owners who are turning to 
taxidermists in order to keep their beloved animals with them forever. Most 
taxidermists refuse to work on pets because, they say, the owners are never 
really satisfied. Taxidermists say they can make animals look like they're 
alive, but they can't put personalities in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three are willing to handle pets. Some of those they have worked on 
include iguanas, hamsters, dogs, cats and snakes. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, it's against the law to stuff a human being (though the request is 
still made). The prices listed below include mounting.
