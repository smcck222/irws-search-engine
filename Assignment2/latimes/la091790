<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Voss knows all about the aerial spraying of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
As a San Joaquin Valley farmer, he occasionally hires an airplane to spray his 
peach orchard -- and his house in the middle of the orchard -- with 
fungus-killing pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Voss ordered 
the spraying of malathion over homes in Southern California to eradicate the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
"We in agriculture have to live with pesticides," Voss said in a recent 
interview. "Most of us live on the farm. We have to live in an environment 
where pesticides are used from time to time. We're not without concerns, but 
when applied properly, most of us feel it's safe." 
</P>
<P>
Voss, a genial 57-year-old grower, typifies a long California tradition of 
appointing farmers to run the agency that regulates the agriculture industry. 
The former head of the California Farm Bureau -- the state's largest farm 
organization -- now presides over a department that has a profound effect on 
the safety of the food people eat, the water they drink and the air they 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the Department of Food and Agriculture is charged with a dual mission. 
It has the job of "promoting and protecting the agriculture industry." It is 
also responsible for "the protection of the public health, safety and welfare." 
</P>
<P>
But when the two goals come into conflict, the department has a history of 
siding with the interests of the $17.5-billion industry, its critics say. 
Environmentalists, farm worker activists and even some Deukmejian 
Administration officials contend that the department acts as the guardian of 
agriculture at the expense of the public health. 
</P>
<P>
In urban Los Angeles, the role of the department in protecting the interest of 
farmers has become abundantly clear this year as helicopters hired by the state 
agency have sprayed malathion repeatedly over residential neighborhoods to 
eradicate the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Now, both candidates for governor, Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein, have called for change in the way the state regulates pesticides. 
Feinstein supports stripping the department of its pesticide regulation program 
and turning it over to the Department of Health Services. Wilson proposes 
creating an Environmental Protection Agency that would include pesticide 
regulation among its functions. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a major portion of Proposition 128 -- the sweeping environmental 
initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot -- is aimed directly at Voss and his 
department. Among its many features, the proposition would ban the use of 19 
cancer-causing chemicals on crops and curb the department's authority over 
pesticides and farm worker safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Voss comes from the agriculture industry and he views his role as acting 
on behalf of the big growers, not on behalf of the public," charged Al 
Meyerhoff, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council and a 
co-sponsor of the initiative. "It's just like having the agriculture industry 
itself regulating pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
The department was created by the Legislature in 1880 to help growers stem an 
outbreak of phylloxera, a devastating disease that attacks grape vines. First 
known as the Board of Viticultural Commissioners, the agency now has 2,141 
employees and a budget of $210 million. 
</P>
<P>
It regulates weights and measures, inspects produce, controls farm pests and 
animal diseases and promotes the sale of farm products in California and 
abroad. At the same time, the department has the primary authority within 
California for deciding what pesticides can be used and what exposures are safe 
for farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
Voss, appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian in April, 1989, rejects the notion 
that the department unfairly favors agriculture. At times, he points out, the 
department has banned pesticides or imposed restrictions on farmers that make 
it tougher to compete with growers in other states. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to go out and ask people in agriculture, they would tell you we're 
trying to put them out of business," Voss said. "In many cases, they think 
we're their enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Merlin Fagan, a lobbyist for the California Farm Bureau, put it a little 
differently: "What we see is this agency has a very difficult task because it 
tries to make decisions involving worker safety, environmental safety and also 
maintain some type of viable production. . . . Food and Agriculture has made a 
lot of decisions on issues that farmers were not happy with." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the interests of agriculture are well represented within the 
department. In addition to Voss and other top officials drawn from the ranks of 
industry, a myriad of advisory boards set up to guide the department are 
dominated by farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Of 1,072 positions on these boards, 889 are filled with members who represent 
the agriculture industry. Another 126 are filled by government staff members or 
academic experts on agriculture. That leaves only 57 positions -- or 5% -- for 
individuals designated to represent the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
"The medical world is regulated by medical people," Voss said. "They don't 
bring in garbage collectors or attorneys. The legal profession is regulated by 
legal people. I don't think it's particularly unusual that people from an 
industry are involved." 
</P>
<P>
One of the department's most controversial actions was the decision by Voss 
last year to permit farmers in most of California to continue using a pesticide 
known to contaminate ground water. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of state scientists, including representatives from the Department of 
Health Services and the State Water Resources Control Board, recommended that 
the pesticide aldicarb be banned because of its ability to contaminate ground 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Aldicarb is perhaps best known for causing the widespread poisoning of 
California consumers in 1985 after the chemical was illegally applied on 
watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide has been found in ground water in Humboldt County, where the 
water table is higher than in most areas of the state. A study by the product's 
manufacturer, Rhone-Poulenc, showed the chemical moves easily through soil to 
ground water 50 feet below and lasts for at least two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Voss overruled the committee of scientists and said aldicarb could be used 
safely. To counter the panel's findings, the department conducted its own 
survey of wells 200 to 300 feet deep and found no evidence of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Voss defended his decision, saying farmers in the San Joaquin Valley should be 
permitted to continue using aldicarb because soil conditions there are 
different than in Humboldt County. 
</P>
<P>
"The director is not here to blindly accept all the advisory committee's 
advice," Voss said. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar case, Voss' predecessor, Jack Parnell, approved the continued use 
of atrazine, a popular herbicide found in ground water in Los Angeles and other 
parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Implementing a 1985 law intended to prevent the contamination of ground water, 
Parnell banned the use of atrazine within a mile of wells found to be polluted. 
But he placed no restriction on the use of atrazine in uncontaminated areas. 
</P>
<P>
By that logic, environmentalists protested, the use of atrazine is prohibited 
only after contamination occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Parnell, now deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, explained 
his view of the law in a 1987 interview with California Farmer Magazine: "We're 
trying to make sure we can keep the tools we need," he said. "We're being as 
lenient as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists point to the decisions on atrazine and aldicarb as examples 
of how life would change under Proposition 128, which supporters call the "Big 
Green" initiative. If approved by voters, the power to ban such a pesticide 
would be transferred to the Department of Health Services -- whose experts 
recommended banning aldicarb and placing stricter restrictions on atrazine. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Food and Agriculture also is under fire for allowing the 
continued use of 19 pesticides identified by the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the state of California as causing cancer or birth defects. All 19 
would be phased out if the initiative passes. 
</P>
<P>
Voss defends use of those pesticides, saying it is still unclear how much of a 
risk they pose to humans in the amounts used on California crops. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to look at each one of those chemicals and look at what the risk of 
cancer is," Voss said. "Some of those chemicals in the dietary process you 
would have to consume truckloads of them every week." 
</P>
<P>
Meyerhoff, the Natural Resources Defense Council attorney, countered: "His 
comment is probably the best evidence of why we need this initiative. It 
reflects the logic of the nation's big pesticide companies and food producers. 
That's not good science." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a study by the Senate Office of Research concluded that the 
department was violating standard scientific procedures in approving the use of 
hundreds of chemical products in California that were not proven to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations by the department's own health experts have been ignored, 
overruled and even changed by non-scientist staff members in their rush to 
approve pesticide products for use, the Senate Office of Research reported. 
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence of these problems, Californians are not warned about known 
and unknown hazards that exist as a result of pesticide exposure," the report 
concluded. "It is likely that hundreds of pesticide products currently 
registered for use in California contain inappropriate warning labels or lack 
adequate and complete health effect studies to evaluate potential hazards." 
</P>
<P>
In at least one case, Senate researchers said, a scientific report was altered 
with White-Out by department officials to cast a chemical in a more positive 
light. Scientists within the department's Medical Toxicology Branch, which 
conducts scientific review of pesticides considered for use in California, have 
complained of interference by department officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who lack expertise and training are attempting to compromise the 
scientific integrity of Ph.D.s with considerable experience," protested 10 
department scientists in a 1986 letter to their superiors. During the 
Deukmejian Administration, the Medical Toxicology Branch has been plagued with 
high turnover among scientists, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 128 and Wilson's proposal, the department would lose the 
medical toxicology unit and its authority to conduct the scientific review of 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
But Voss, in defending his department against charges that it is biased, 
praised the quality of scientists and health experts that work for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the people who really make the judgments and write the recommendations 
. . . and it's very seldom that their recommendations are not accepted," Voss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Voss rejected many of the charges contained in the Senate Office of Research 
report, but acknowledged that his department had not properly conducted the 
review of some chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"There's obviously some errors made and some mistakes," Voss said. "A couple of 
cases actually did slip through." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Food and Agriculture has long been criticized for its 
handling of worker safety laws. For years, it resisted such proposals as 
banning the short-handled hoe and requiring the wider posting of signs in 
fields to notify workers when crops had been treated with pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the department has come under fire for allowing farm workers to 
be exposed to hazardous levels of pesticides when working in the fields. 
Department officials acknowledge that at least 257 farm workers have suffered 
cases of pesticide poisoning since 1986 because standards set by the Department 
of Food and Agriculture allowed them to enter treated fields before it was 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the department moved to extend the quarantine period or prohibit 
use of the pesticide after the workers became ill. For example, repeated cases 
of poisoning forced the department to increase the quarantine period for 
methomyl in grape fields first from one day to seven days, then to two weeks 
and now, at certain times of the year, to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But Ralph Lightstone, an attorney with the California Rural Legal Assistance 
Foundation, charged that the department has been too lax in setting safe 
standards that would have prevented the poisoning cases in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Farm workers are being treated like guinea pigs," Lightstone said. "Over the 
years, hundreds, maybe thousands, have been poisoned. The quarantines are 
inadequate and they are not enforced adequately." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael O'Malley of the department's worker health and safety branch said 
the agency uses theoretical models to predict when it is safe for workers to 
re-enter fields, but acknowledged that the models are not always accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear from these episodes there were some gaps in the existing 
regulations," O'Malley said. "Some of the models used were not adequate for 
predicting the safe re-entry time." 
</P>
<P>
But when cases of illness arose, he emphasized, the department moved quickly to 
protect workers' health. "The crucial point to me is that the surveillance 
system works well and that when we identify problems we can respond 
adequately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, state records show that few farmers are severely punished for 
violating pesticide regulations or farm labor safety laws. The department takes 
the view that it is better to persuade farmers to comply with the law than to 
cite them. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the responsibility for enforcing pesticide regulations is delegated to 
county agriculture commissioners who are appointed by county boards of 
supervisors but are accountable, in part, to the director of Food and 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide in 1988-89, 517 violators were fined and eight were the subject of 
civil or criminal complaints. By contrast, 5,766 violators received 
non-punitive sanctions such as a letter of warning, a notice of violation, a 
cease-and-desist order or a personal interview with county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Some counties that are heavily agricultural were even more lenient in their 
enforcement activities. Kern County, for example, took non-punitive action in 
357 cases, levied only 13 fines on agricultural offenders and referred no cases 
to county prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Los Angeles County, with a smaller farm community, levied fines in 
89 cases, referred two cases to the district attorney and issued 267 
non-punitive warning notices. Even heavily urban Alameda County fined 17 
farmers -- 31% more than Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances of being caught are extremely low, and the chances of being 
punished are even lower," Lightstone said. "We need some law and order and 
tough pesticide enforcement in agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
Voss, however, explained the department's rationale: "First of all, you have to 
decide whether you're trying to build a record of catching people and fining 
people or whether you're trying to assure a safe use of chemicals. And if 
you're looking for a safe use of chemicals, then I think education and working 
with industry in the long term will be a lot more productive . . . than having 
stiff penalties and pointing to the number of penalties." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the state is lenient when it comes to licensing pesticide 
applicators. 
</P>
<P>
The state routinely issues licenses to pesticide applicators without reviewing 
their record of violations, officials said. In fact, the department keeps no 
centralized record of the enforcement actions taken against violators of 
pesticide laws. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the state issued a license to San Joaquin Helicopters -- and hired 
the company to spray malathion over homes in Southern California -- without 
checking the company's record of violating pesticide laws. Records kept by the 
Kern and Fresno County agricultural commissioners showed that the firm was 
cited 13 times since 1986 for such things as spraying crops with prohibited 
pesticides and discharging chemicals on a county road. 
</P>
<P>
Voss acknowledged that the failure to keep a centralized record of violations 
is a flaw in the department's operations and indicated the state should check 
each operator's record before issuing a license. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a good point and we ought to look at it seriously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To its critics, the department's handling of the Medfly crisis illustrates the 
agency's reliance on pesticides and its willingness to help farmers at the 
expense of urban dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the constant threat of infestation during the last decade, the 
department was not prepared to handle the massive invasion of Mediterranean 
fruit flies in Southern California during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The state's breeding facility for sterile fruit flies -- which are used to 
thwart the pest's spread -- was woefully inadequate for the scale of the 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to rely on the sterile flies, the department resorted to repeated aerial 
spraying of malathion in an attempt to keep the insect from spreading to rural 
areas of the state where crops could be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
While Voss and his colleagues were comfortable with the aerial application of 
pesticides in residential areas, the spraying of malathion alarmed thousands of 
Southland residents who worried that it would be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said the handling of the Medfly illustrates the department's 
subservience to agribusiness. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression of the California Department of Food and Agriculture is that 
they put economic decisions above health decisions and they put industry and 
the old-boy network above the general public," said Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), an opponent of the spraying. "I think the Medfly is a perfect 
example of economic concerns outweighing health concerns. The department has 
maintained from Day 1 that they knew what they were doing, but they didn't do 
their homework." 
</P>
<P>
But Voss defended his department's handling of the infestation, saying it had 
little choice but to halt the Medfly with malathion. In retrospect, he said, 
the department's mistake was in not launching a public relations campaign to 
persuade residents of the need for the spraying and its safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's an awful lot the department would have done differently, 
all the other circumstances being the same," he said.

DANSON, BERGEN WIN EMMYS FOR COMEDY SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Danson, nominated eight times for the Emmy Award as best actor in a comedy 
series, finally won it on Sunday in the nationally televised 42nd Annual 
Primetime Emmy Awards. Candice Bergen won top honors for best actress in a 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess this means you'll be saying 'You were robbed' to some other boy," 
Danson kidded the black-tie audience in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. He plays 
Sam Malone, the womanizing bartender in the NBC comedy "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
His co-star, Kirstie Alley, earlier had ribbed Danson about his poor track 
record, likening it to a sexually unfulfilling trip to the drive-in theater. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly what happened to me in the drive-in," Danson said when he won. 
"The whole drive-in stood up and cheered." 
</P>
<P>
Bergen, who won for the title role on CBS' "Murphy Brown," thanked her fellow 
cast members "for helping me with my marks every week." 
</P>
<P>
"Delta (Burke) is going to be waiting for me in the parking lot," Bergen said, 
referring to a fellow nominee. "I really feel twice blessed." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Rocco won the Emmy as comedy's outstanding supporting actor for his 
portrayal of sleazy talent agent Al Floss in "The Famous Teddy Z." The 
supporting actress award for a comedy went to Bebe Neuwirth, the self-possessed 
psychoanalyst on "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, lady," said a stunned Rocco upon accepting his statuette. "My gratitude 
to Hugh Wilson for creating Al Floss, the most fun character I ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Said Neuwirth, who plays Lilith on "Cheers": "I'm overwhelmed. I'd like to 
thank all my friends and family who said go ahead and take the job in 
television in Los Angel es." 
</P>
<P>
"The Wonder Years" collected trophies for best directing (Michael Dinner) and 
writing (Bob Brush) in a comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence McNally won the writing honor miniseries or special category for 
"Andre's Mother," on American Playhouse (PBS). 
</P>
<P>
The award for supporting actor in a miniseries or special went to Vincent 
Gardenia for "Age-Old Friends" on HBO. Director Joseph Sargent won the trophy 
for a miniseries or special for "Caroline?" on the Hallmark Hall of Fame on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Eva Marie Saint won in the supporting actress category for a miniseries or 
special for her role on NBC's "People Like Us." 
</P>
<P>
Bergen, Jay Leno and Jane Pauley were hosts of the gala event. 
</P>
<P>
ABC took an early lead in the 42nd annual award presentation, winning 13 Emmys 
in the non-televised segment of the program leading up to Sunday's nationally 
televised show. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday night's creative arts Emmys, ABC had 13 trophies, NBC had 11 and 
CBS had 6. 
</P>
<P>
ABC and NBC had tied for the most nominations with 95 selections. CBS had 73 
and Fox drew 23. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's quirky drama "Twin Peaks" won two awards in Saturday's non-televised 
program -- for editing and costume design. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's "The Simpsons" was selected top animated program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Twin Peaks," multiple winners from Saturday's festivities were 
Fox's "The Tracey Ullman Show" and HBO's "Carmen on Ice," with three awards 
each, and NBC's "The Phantom of the Opera," with two. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday's broadcast, Leonard Goldenson was selected as the recipient of 
the annual Governor's Award. Goldenson, founder of the American Broadcasting 
Cos., joins such previous winners of the award as Grant Tinker, Lucille Ball, 
Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and Alistair Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
The Emmy for outstanding achievement in casting was announced in August. It 
went to Randy Stone and Holly Powell for CBS' "The Incident." 
</P>
<P>
The Fox network, which has broadcast the Emmys for the last three years, is in 
the first year of a new three-year contract with the television academy. 
Despite attracting smaller ratings than the three major networks, the Fox 
broadcasts have helped to establish the fourth network as a significant 
television presence. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast was seen in more than two dozen countries, representing a global 
audience of 150 million. Nations receiving the show included Bangladesh, Costa 
Rica, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

REFUGEES FROM KUWAIT TELL OF GROWING PANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convoy of overloaded Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs and Chevrolets streamed across the 
border into Saudi Arabia on Sunday as thousands of Kuwaitis rushed for a newly 
opened border station amid a growing atmosphere of panic in the Kuwaiti 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 5,000 or more Kuwaiti refugees fled over the weekend in what 
officials here said appears to be a new effort by Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein to drive Kuwaitis out of their homeland and establish an immovable 
Iraqi foothold in the embattled gulf sheikdom. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's government in exile, alarmed at the growing exodus and the atmosphere 
of terror that has prompted it, is considering a move to call for 
U.N.-sanctioned military intervention to check the crisis, according to 
diplomatic sources in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
Residents fleeing Kuwait say Iraqi soldiers over the past several days have 
shot 21 Kuwaitis who refused to display a picture of the Iraqi president, 
gunned down 12 doctors for allegedly inadequate treatment of an Iraqi soldier 
and shot and killed several young Kuwaiti men at their homes in front of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of thing that some people call genocide, and if people wanted 
to construe it as such, it could be cause for some kind of military 
intervention," said a Western diplomat in close contact with the Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
Military intervention "is not inconceivable at all to me if some of the things 
we're hearing are true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuwaiti government in exile was noncommittal in its official 
statement, calling the Iraqi-inspired exodus "a new political game" designed to 
drive Kuwaitis out of the country and replace them with Iraqis. "Its aim is to 
get all of the Kuwaiti people out of Kuwait," the government said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also fear that Iraq may use the refugee influx to plant terrorists 
inside Saudi Arabia, a scenario that kept refugees queued up at the border for 
hours Sunday as Saudi officials carefully searched their cars, including trunks 
and undercarriages, and pored over whatever personal documents they had 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Because nearly all the Kuwaitis' passports and other identification documents 
were confiscated by Iraqi soldiers at checkpoints near the border, a Kuwaiti 
committee was set up on the Saudi side of the border to interview incoming 
refugees and determine -- by listening to accents and asking detailed questions 
about their families, jobs and backgrounds -- whether they were true Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials for the past several weeks have feared that Iraq is attempting 
to establish a large core group of Iraqis within Kuwait who hold Kuwaiti 
passports, a scenario that could allow Hussein to establish a pro-Iraqi 
government in Kuwait even if his troops are ultimately withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
"In another six months, you can dislodge Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, but you 
won't be able to get Kuwait back," a Saudi official said in an interview before 
the weekend exodus began. "Six months from now, the emir (of Kuwait) can come 
back and the Kuwaitis say, 'Hell no, we don't want him.' And most Kuwaitis 
saying this would be Iraqis, and guess who they would vote for?" 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and government officials said it is also likely that the Iraqis are 
seeking to cause problems for Saudi Arabia, which is already seeking to house 
an estimated 120,000 Kuwaiti refugees in hotels, apartments and temporary 
housing all over the kingdom. More than 80,000 refugees of other nationalities 
also fled into the kingdom before Iraqi soldiers slowed traffic at the border 
to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees who streamed across the border Sunday represented a broad cross 
section of the Kuwaiti middle class -- merchants, business executives, 
management consultants and engineers, most of them traveling in upscale cars 
laden with stuffed suitcases, boxes of baby bottles and diapers and children 
hanging their heads out of back windows. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome America, welcome everybody in the world to help Kuwait. We ask God to 
let them help us," declared a man who identified himself only as Jaber as he 
stepped out of his car in Saudi Arabia. "I have nothing there. Everything is 
finished. Better I come to Saudi Arabia to hold the gun. Better that than die 
there, an animal." 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Sharyan, who escaped with her brother, said Iraqi troops were breaking 
into private homes to steal food and had shot three Kuwaiti teen-age boys in 
her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's horrible. You can't believe it," she said, breaking into tears. "They are 
animals inside, not soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the Kuwaitis said their passports had been confiscated, but some 
said Iraqi soldiers appeared to be encouraging them to leave. "When anybody 
asked them on the border if they can go out, the Iraqi soldiers say, 'Yes, you 
can go. We prefer you get your family outside.' They want all of the families 
out," said one refugee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they want to change everything to Iraqi," said Hamad al Jariba, a 
Kuwaiti Airlines employee. "They want to remove all the Kuwaitis and move 
Iraqis in and tell the world, 'Now see how Kuwait is happy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials said 1,800 Kuwaitis had crossed the border by Saturday night, 
and diplomatic sources in Riyadh said that as many as 5,000 to 8,000 had 
crossed the border over the weekend. It was not known how long the border would 
remain open. Some of the refugees camped out near their cars in Khafji, but 
most appeared to be driving on to Dhahran or Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
Western officials said they are still investigating reports of atrocities in 
Kuwait and added that many appeared to be well-documented and supported by 
enough eyewitness accounts that they could be considered true. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, refugees reported that incubators for premature babies were 
confiscated by Iraqi troops and the babies inside were piled on the floor and 
left to die. In another, a number of refugees and Kuwaiti resistance leaders 
reported that Iraqi soldiers broke into a traditional gathering of Kuwaiti men 
Friday night and shot to death 21 people who refused to put up a poster of 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Western, Saudi and Kuwaiti government officials say they have received reports, 
corroborated by interviews with refugees in Khafji, that Iraqi soldiers had 
taken five young Kuwaiti men into custody, tied their hands and then took them 
to the doorsteps of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"When the parents answered, they said, 'Is this your son?' They shot him on the 
spot and left his body on the doorstep," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
At the border Sunday, there was an air of frustration at diplomatic efforts to 
resolve the crisis. Some refugees talked of seeing their families safely into 
Saudi Arabia, then going back to join the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
A man who identified himself only as Abdullah began yelling as his family 
pulled him toward the desk where entry documents were being examined. "We need 
your help!" he shouted at reporters. "Please! Without American and European 
help, Kuwait will go. Arab will not help us. Never. Never, never, never. 
Please."

CONGESTION FAILS TO DRIVE MOTORISTS TO CAR POOLING; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: INTEREST IN RIDE SHARING IS ACTUALLY LESS TODAY. INCENTIVES 
NEED TO BE STRONGER, EXPERTS SAY.

<P>
For years, the gospel according to car-pool prophets went something like this: 
Once the gridlock on Southern California's web of freeways got nasty enough, 
motorists would surely abandon the single-occupant automobile and team up with 
fellow commuters for the ride to work. 
</P>
<P>
Well, things are pretty miserable out there these days, but most motorists are 
still clinging to that long-cherished Southland credo: One person, one car. 
</P>
<P>
For proof, look no further than the other cars sardined on the freeway during 
rush hour. From Audis to Nissan Zs, they are, by and large, occupied by a solo 
motorist. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989, nearly 4 out of 5 people in Southern California commuted alone, 
and only about 14% car-pooled, experts said. The average number of occupants in 
cars has actually dropped during the last decade, falling on Los Angeles 
freeways from 1.22 people per vehicle in 1980 to 1.19 so far this year. A 
recent survey showed that the percentage of people interested in car pooling 
plummeted from 62% in 1988 to 41% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing those trends could prove a tall order. Transportation experts say the 
reasons for ridesharing's lackluster performance are about as varied as the 
daily mix of cars on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have more car pooling in large part because people don't clearly 
perceive any advantages," said Peter Valk, president of Transportation 
Management Services, a Pasadena-based consulting firm. "I call it WIFM -- 
what's in it for me. WIFM is what motivates all of us in our daily lives. 
There's economics, personal logistics, all sorts of factors. The WIFMs have to 
be strong enough to compel someone to change the routine." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the routine for most motorists has not varied much, and that bodes ill 
for the region. If public transportation and ride sharing do not catch on, 
experts warn that in the next 20 years there could be a fivefold increase in 
congested freeway miles. Average speeds on roads and highways would drop to 
less than 20 m.p.h. from about 35 m.p.h. now. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to almost double the number of people ride sharing to absorb the 
growth we face and maintain the level of mobility we have now," said Bob Huddy, 
associate transportation planner for Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The disappointing percentage of car poolers varies little from county to 
county. In Orange County, about 12% of the motorists car-pooled at least once a 
week in 1988, about the same percentage as residents of other Southland 
counties. The average occupancy of cars in Orange County is estimated at 1.13 
people per vehicle, only fractionally lower than Los Angeles and San Diego 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the greatest variations can be seen from freeway to freeway. Although 
they are two of the busiest highways in the world, the Santa Monica Freeway and 
the Santa Ana Freeway from Orange County typically have the lowest vehicle 
occupancy, according to Caltrans. The Hollywood, Pomona and Harbor freeways, 
meanwhile, have the highest rates. 
</P>
<P>
As transportation gurus see it, several factors have in recent years 
extinguished any embers of hope for a marked upswing in car pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively low gas prices through most of the 1980s and the unwavering practice 
by most businesses of subsidizing employee parking have eased the financial 
costs of driving a car and kept workers commuting alone instead of jumping with 
both feet into ride sharing. 
</P>
<P>
Many motorists grumble about the inconvenience of car pooling -- the time lost 
picking up passengers or the potential hassle of not having a way to run 
errands during the workday. 
</P>
<P>
Others jealously guard the inner sanctum of their cherished vehicle. Car 
pooling, they worry, could mean opening the door to strangers who, God forbid, 
might have bad breath or a penchant for rock music instead of radio news. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it was the White Shoulders perfume," explained Martha Washburn, a 
legal assistant in Newport Beach who gave up car pooling after seven months. 
"It sounds like picky stuff, but in the morning the smell of this woman's 
perfume would just linger. I'd sometimes get nauseous, especially if I didn't 
have breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
Status can also play a role. The task of prying someone from their Mercedes or 
BMW and putting them into something as sensible as a car pool has proven 
particularly vexing in car-crazy Southern California, where what one drives 
often equates to who one is. 
</P>
<P>
"During the go-go '80s, people felt they would lose a few notches on the social 
scale if they even thought about ride sharing," said Peter Everett, a Penn 
State University marketing professor who has done extensive research on car 
pooling. "You're not going to get a guy out of his $30,000 car to save a few 
dollars and lose an incredible amount of social status. Prestige is a big 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of car pooling are the first to admit ride-sharing fever is not 
exactly sweeping the Southland. But they see reason for hope. 
</P>
<P>
The passage in June of a state gas tax increase to finance transportation 
improvements will fund construction of more car-pool lanes that should help 
encourage ride sharing along traffic-choked freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Commuter Transportation Services Inc., the nonprofit outfit that 
helps match car poolers in Southern California from a list of 500,000 commuters 
registered with its Commuter Computer service, is planning a campaign early 
next year stressing that occasionally ride sharing can help. 
</P>
<P>
One day a week is all they ask. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd see an immediate reduction in traffic by 20%," said Jim Sims, the 
agency's president. "It would mean free-flowing traffic, less pollution and a 
shorter trip to work for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is too soon to tell the long-term effects, car-pool promoters are 
encouraged by an increase in the number of drivers calling for ride-sharing 
information since the Persian Gulf crisis created a price increase at the gas 
pump. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the driving force of Regulation 15, the region's new air quality 
provision that requires employers to try to reduce the number of automobile 
trips to the workplace. The rule requires businesses with more than 100 
employees to submit ride-sharing plans to the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. While the companies are required to promote ride sharing, 
employees are not obligated to participate. The full effect of the regulation 
has yet to be felt, but many businesses already have embraced car pooling as 
their prime tactic for easing congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for most companies, car pooling is certainly the cheapest way to meet 
the goals," said Claudia Keith, an AQMD spokeswoman. "Employers have found car 
pooling helps get workers to the job on time and not as stressed out. A lot of 
companies are realizing it can be a bonus instead of a hindrance." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say Southern California companies are not taking aggressive enough 
measures to promote widespread ride sharing. They argue that the battle to win 
car-pool converts must begin in the company parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Studies by SCAG show that if more commuters had to pay for parking in pricey 
high-rise lots, where the monthly tab can run upward of $200, ride sharing 
would surge. Many employers seem reluctant to embrace the notion. When Los 
Angeles recently imposed a 10% parking tax, many companies simply absorbed the 
extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, workers tend to balk when their free parking is threatened. Los 
Angeles County officials encountered stiff resistance from unions over a plan 
to make county employees pay for parking. But last week, they instituted the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Southland cities have not helped matters, doggedly sticking to the timeworn 
practice of requiring plentiful parking at new office buildings instead of 
advocating ride sharing and other alternatives. Most cities are reluctant to 
adopt the more progressive posture, fearful that businesses will move down the 
block to municipalities that do not limit parking. 
</P>
<P>
Some ride-sharing advocates are pushing another tactic, urging companies to 
stop underwriting parking and instead offer workers a "transportation 
allowance" of perhaps $100 if they car-pool or use public transit. Under this 
scenario, workers who continue to drive alone would be hit by a double whammy 
-- they would pay for parking and not reap any monetary benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"The way parking is now, it's a use it or lose it proposition for most 
workers," Huddy said. "Our evidence shows that given the choice, people would 
tend to keep the money and try to find another way to work." 
</P>
<P>
Other factors -- both philosophical and psychological -- have conspired to stem 
the growth of car pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Although freeways are getting more congested, the day-to-day changes are so 
minute that commuters are not spurred to take evasive action such as joining a 
car pool. Moreover, most do not perceive ride sharing to be a financial boon, 
even though studies by Commuter Computer indicate that it can save as much as 
$2,000 in wear and tear on the car and gas costs. 
</P>
<P>
Research also shows that many commuters are afraid to take the leap because of 
an initial shyness with strangers. Promoters have found that the most lasting 
car pools spring from the home or workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Some people cannot seem to even buy a car-pool mate. 
</P>
<P>
George Davidovich, a legal secretary at a downtown Los Angeles law firm, said 
he has come up empty handed after searching for a year. During the hunt, he 
advertised in the company newsletter, offered to make espresso each morning, 
and even promised to pay the full tab for parking. 
</P>
<P>
"I found nobody," he muttered. "I'm still kind of shaking my head about it." 
</P>
<P>
The workaday world can also infringe on car pools. A big overtime project may 
cause problems, or dropping the kid off at child care can get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Car pooling is not very flexible," said David Stein, principal planner for 
SCAG. "If one person has to work even five minutes late, they either have to 
delay their partner or find another way home. For a professional, that's 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Bauer, a car-pool veteran of two decades, has a ready remedy. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't wait for people if they're late," said Bauer, human resources manager 
for Arco in Los Angeles. "We have specific times and we leave at those times. 
And we leave people. It's amazing. You may leave someone once or twice and all 
of a sudden they get the message and aren't late any more." 
</P>
<P>
Many commuters stay out of car pools because they think they would waste time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's faster to go out into your garage, hop into the car and drive to work," 
said Elizabeth Deakin, a professor at UC Berkeley's Institute of Transportation 
Studies. "If you have to stop and pick someone up you can add five or 10 
minutes to the trip. Unless there's some countervailing force like a car-pool 
lane to save a bit of time, it's hard for most people to justify that they're 
doing it for the good of society." 
</P>
<P>
With the looming threat of Regulation 15, some businesses have retaliated by 
guaranteeing workers a ride home via taxicab if they miss their car pool. 
Others, such as IBM in downtown Los Angeles, have contracted with rental car 
firms to provide employees midday wheels if they need them. 
</P>
<P>
Many firms continue to push car pooling with incentives such as mugs bearing 
the company logo or parking spaces a few steps closer to the office. Some 
authorities say it is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we restrict the incentives for car pooling to things that are 
really rather mild, like prizes and free lunch once a month, we're going to get 
a rather mild response," said Genevieve Giuliano, an associate professor of 
urban and regional planning at USC. "It's not enough to offset the extra time 
and loss of convenience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Car-Pooling in Southern California 
</P>
<P>
Through traffic is worse than a decade ago, car pools now make up a smaller 
percentage of the vehicles on the road, according to Caltrans. As a result, the 
average number of people per vehicle has dropped slightly since 1980.

TODDLER 'REAL WELL' AFTER A NIGHT TRAPPED IN HOLE

A toddler trapped for 14 hours in a shaft dug for a construction project busied 
himself making mud balls and listening to his mother sing nursery songs before 
rescuers reached him at dawn Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really difficult. I could hear him crying, but I couldn't touch him and 
I couldn't help him," Lisa Davis, mother of 20-month-old Kevin, told reporters 
as she fought back tears. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue workers cheered when the boy was brought to the surface shortly 
after 6 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"When he clinched my fingers, I felt a tingle in my heart," said firefighter 
Joe Cipri, who pulled him out. "It's still there." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin was taken to Denver General Hospital, where he was treated for mild 
hypothermia, dehydration and scrapes on his elbows. 
</P>
<P>
About eight hours later, he was sent home, wearing a T-shirt and shorts and no 
visible bandage or other sign of his ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Murray, the emergency room physician who treated Kevin, said the 
toddler was given food and fluids to counteract dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate any psychological problems down the road. He came through 
this real well," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
It all started at about 4 p.m. Saturday, when Kevin fell into a hole, 18 inches 
wide and 12 feet deep, that was dug for a remodeling project. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters worked through the night to keep the boy warm and dry. They pumped 
oxygen into the hole and used lights to keep the temperature at about 70 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
His mother said that Kevin kept himself amused by rolling mud into balls with 
his fingers and spinning himself around in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers first dug a vertical shaft, then delicately tunneled through the 
five feet of earth to where Kevin was. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Davis, the boy's father, said he did not have a permit to dig.

The Suez Canal, one of Egypt's main sources of badly needed hard currency, is 
expected to lose 10% of its revenues this year as a result of the U.N. blockade 
of Iraq, an official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Izzat Adel, chairman of the Suez Canal authority, told the state-owned 
Middle East News Agency that before the embargo was imposed in August, Iraq and 
Kuwait accounted for the annual export of 7 million tons of oil through the 
canal. 
</P>
<P>
Their imports through the international waterway were also halted as a result 
of the embargo, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.

Pressure increased Sunday on the United Auto Workers to strike General Motors 
as around-the-clock negotiations failed to produce agreement on a new contract 
two days after a strike deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
Bargaining continued into the night, extending a marathon session that started 
Saturday at 9 a.m. as the two sides haggled over ways to protect the jobs of 
some 300,000 GM workers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by UAW leaders to ignore the midnight Friday strike deadline had 
little meaning until today, when the workweek begins at about 240 GM sites in 
33 states. 
</P>
<P>
The union leadership is scheduled to meet today with about 30 local union 
leaders, some of whom are calling for a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW's caution contrasts with its 12,800 Canadian counterparts whose 
separate auto workers union struck Ford of Canada after failing to reach a new 
agreement Friday night.

MAN DISTURBS HIS NEIGHBORHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
TUJUNGA: FOR 13 YEARS, LUDOVIT SALKA HAS BEEN WATCHING PEOPLE HE SAYS BELONG TO 
A HUGE DRUG RING. AUTHORITIES SAY IT'S HIS IMAGINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atop a mountain in the Tujunga Hills, Ludovit Salka stood hunched behind a 
small pine tree, peeping into the next yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Now!" he said, his 6-foot, 200-pound frame nearly shaking with excitement as a 
middle-aged man emerged from a garage and entered the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is Monday! People should be at work!" he whispered loudly. "What are 
they doing?" he asked, then answered his own question: "Producing drugs!" 
</P>
<P>
Ludovit Salka has spent the better part of the past 13 years watching, 
photographing and taking notes on his neighbors' movements. The 72-year-old 
Czechoslovakian immigrant is convinced that the entire middle-class 
neighborhood surrounding his comfortable Estepa Drive home is part of an 
elaborate ring that produces "tons" of cocaine, PCP and other illegal drugs. He 
believes members of the "ring" are trying to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Salka has told nearly everyone who will listen -- police, fire and health 
officials, City Council members, county supervisors and Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley -- about the elaborate clandestine drug labs. He also has told them 
about the underground tunnels used to transport drugs all over the city, and 
about the toxic fumes emitted from the labs. The fumes, he says, have killed 
huge pine trees in his yard and driven away the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say such claims are as far-fetched as they seem and, except for the 
effect on Salka's neighbors, could be dismissed as nothing more than harmless 
delusions. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Salka earned the dubious distinction of being the first person ever 
in Los Angeles County to be prohibited by a court order from using the 911 
emergency number to report narcotics activities. The Los Angeles Police 
Department sought the order after he called a record 582 times during July. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unusual step," Deputy City Atty. Mary E. House said of the restraining 
order. "But this is an unusual situation." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Salka said the fumes also make it impossible for him to stay overnight 
in his home, and for the past seven years he has slept in his rickety brown van 
in various parking lots on Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"The fumes are so deadly," he said with a pained expression, rattling off a 
list of illnesses he and his wife say they have suffered as a result. "I only 
call when my life and the life of my wife are in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Jeffrey Harkavy said of Salka, "He's a very tortured and 
tormented man, but there's just no foundation in reality" for his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Salka has pursued his claims doggedly, and, ironically, has created a 
textbook example of how to use the legal system and governmental agencies to 
combat a neighborhood problem, real or perceived. 
</P>
<P>
His crusade, neighbors say, has made them feel under siege and powerless, 
despite attempts to fight back in court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really unfortunate," Jackie Tanker said. "He knows how to use the legal 
system really well. It's sad we have to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Salka's neighbors have won a series of restraining orders against him dating to 
1982, court records show. He has been convicted of illegal burning and served 
134 days in jail for violating terms of a probation order. Other cases, some of 
which were dismissed, have dealt with charges of disturbing the peace. The 
court cases number at least 14 -- all related to Salka's belief that his 
neighbors are manufacturing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents show that Salka normally starts out representing himself in 
legal proceedings, but is then ordered by a judge to hire an attorney. 
Neighbors complain that he has managed to delay cases for years, by requesting 
continuances, firing attorneys and attempting in vain to subpoena the entire 
city attorney's office or Foothill police division. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Linda Paugh and 17 other residents of Salka's neighborhood won a 
restraining order prohibiting Salka from harassing and molesting them. But they 
say it and other similar orders have not stopped him. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been the victims," said Paugh, who lives directly across from Salka on 
a cul-de-sac in the 7200 block of Estepa Drive. "We have been punished on a 
day-to-day basis. It's just been a nonstop battle." 
</P>
<P>
According to Salka, Paugh is the "ringleader" of the drug conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 feet, 11 inches, wearing shorts and with her hair pulled back, Paugh looks 
more like a high school cheerleader than a drug dealer. Sitting at her kitchen 
table, the walls covered with photographs of her new grandchild, she sorted 
through a mound of court papers and photographs and the business cards of all 
the governmental agencies that have investigated her and her family over the 
years because of Salka's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I'm going to put this all in a box and burn it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with Salka began around 1977, when Paugh and others noticed increased 
police patrols in their quiet hilltop neighborhood. She asked one of the police 
officers what was going on and was told that she and her neighbors were being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it just kept getting worse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Paugh and others began receiving regular calls and visits from the Police 
Department, the county Health Department and others investigating Salka's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had the Health Department in my house about six times," said Dennis 
Nicholson, who lives next to Salka. "I've had the narcotics squad, the police 
came up regularly. Virtually every city agency has been up here." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the increased police activity, Salka began patrolling the streets 
in his van, apparently trying to spot and interrupt drug activities, Paugh 
said. Even now, he drives slowly up and down the streets, parks in front of a 
house and watches. 
</P>
<P>
Then came what they dubbed "smell-o-meters" -- homemade noisy contraptions that 
apparently are supposed to detect drugs in the air. He also has made attempts 
to prove scientifically that drugs were being produced. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he has walked up and down Estepa Drive in the early morning, 
swinging a lantern or shining a flashlight into houses, causing dogs to bark. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 Salka tried to smoke the drug dealers out -- literally. On several 
mornings during that summer Paugh and her neighbors awakened to the stench of 
rubber burning and saw thick black smoke coming from Salka's yard. 
</P>
<P>
Salka served a 21-day jail sentence for illegal outdoor burnings, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
Paugh, an accountant, and Dan Drake, a friend of hers who is an auto mechanic, 
said Salka constantly photographs them and their visitors and jots down the 
license plate of every strange car parked on the street. 
</P>
<P>
But his nighttime sermons are perhaps the most disconcerting of all Salka's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in his yard, which overlooks the street, Salka shouts at the top of 
his voice the addresses of his neighbors followed by a rambling diatribe 
accusing them of being murderers, drug manufacturers and criminals, Paugh said. 
"My daughter never had company over, and he was the reason why," she said, 
recalling the impact Salka's accusations had on her life and the lives of her 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 California law requires that homeowners disclose to buyers all defects 
as well as all litigation that involves the property. 
</P>
<P>
So when Jim and Jackie Tanker bought their house across the street from Salka 
three years ago, the seller had to tell them about their new neighbor's 
behavior. But they had no idea the problem was so extensive. 
</P>
<P>
"He met us on the first day and told us there were people manufacturing drugs 
in the neighborhood . . . that we should join forces with him," Jim Tanker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, the Tankers were added to the enemies Salka shouted about 
nightly. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, in connection with a court proceeding for violating a restraining 
order, Salka was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. A court-appointed 
doctor found him competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not crazy," Nicholson said. "He's just obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his home, dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and slacks and a tie, 
Salka does not look the part of a madman. 
</P>
<P>
But he readily admits to the behavior his neighbors describe. "What am I 
supposed to do? I have to shout because I get no help from nobody," he said, 
accusing the police, fire, and health departments of conspiring with the drug 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
On request he displays photographs he has taken that he believes prove his 
claims, letters he has written to officials requesting assistance and a neatly 
drawn map of his neighborhood: Red arrows indicate what he says is the flow of 
toxic fumes being shot from drug labs toward his house. 
</P>
<P>
Salka and his wife, Kristina, 67, own a seven-room house on a wooded 3/4-acre 
lot. Salka built the home and decorated it with ornately carved antique oak 
furniture, red Persian rugs and brightly colored couches that seem brand-new. 
</P>
<P>
But Salka no longer sleeps in his house. Nor does he entertain company there. 
"After a while the house feels like a gas chamber," Salka said in a lilting 
Czech accent. "We have to flee to escape a certain death." He returns every 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Kristina Salka claims to have suffered temporary blindness from the fumes. She 
said when the fumes are too strong, she leaves the house, walking with her dog 
in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
But the Salkas say that even outside the house, they fear for their lives. 
Kristina Salka said she has been the target of drive-by shootings many times. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they follow me for 2 1/2 hours," she said in broken English. 
</P>
<P>
A retired real estate broker and mechanical engineer, Salka served with Axis 
forces during World War II and immigrated to the U.S. in 1952. Now he spends 
much of his time and "a terrible amount of money" attempting to prove what many 
others, including many city agencies, have dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"Every police officer in the Foothill area knows Ludovit Salka or knows of 
Ludovit Salka," said Detective Jim Soles. "Never has it ever been . . . found 
that what he is complaining about is happening in his neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1985, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services 
conducted at least six investigations into Salka's claims and found nothing. 
The city Fire Department and the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
also investigated, with no result. 
</P>
<P>
But Salka vows to continue his fight. "I've been to court 14 times and to jail 
seven times," he said, almost proudly. 
</P>
<P>
In one criminal court case he submitted letters from 30 people supporting his 
claim, and says there are at least 20 others who support him as well. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse R. Williams, a private investigator, wrote that he "experienced a burning 
sensation in my nostrils and throat" when in the neighborhood. "It is my 
opinion someone in this neighborhood is working with toxic chemicals." 
Williams, whose company, Delta Investigations, is based in Sacramento, was paid 
by Salka, and some of the others who have written letters in support were hired 
by Salka through newspaper ads. Neighbors and others have dismissed their 
testimony as meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the restraining orders against Salka, his surveillance activities 
continue and neighbors say they have run out of options. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a very sick man and we're really not sure what to do at this point," 
said Paugh, who has lived in her house for 25 years. "It is not just a hoax. . 
. . He is very serious -- that's the saddest part of it. He does believe it." 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, they are incredibly tolerant people," Harkavy, the deputy city 
attorney, said of Salka's neighbors. "Mr. Salka is fortunate that these people 
are working through the legal system and not taking matters into their own 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors fear that he may one day turn away from the system that he has placed 
so much faith in, perhaps becoming violent. Drake, Paugh's frequent visitor who 
has been watched and photographed by Salka, said, "His obsession is dangerous."

POLICE LEAVE BREAKFAST TO CHASE SUSPECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
That was to go, right? 
</P>
<P>
Four uniformed Los Angeles police officers had just sat down to breakfast at a 
North Hollywood restaurant Sunday morning when a man allegedly grabbed an 
envelope full of cash from a drawer under the cash register and ran out the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Abandoning their coffee, the officers gave chase and apprehended 30-year-old 
Jerald Patrick McMurray of Studio City a few blocks from Sitton's Restaurant at 
11329 Magnolia Blvd., Lt. Michael Ranshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found $63 and McMurray was held in lieu of $5,000 bail on suspicion of 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can figure is he just didn't see them sitting there," Ranshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers returned to complete their meal. It was on the house.

THE CAUSE THAT'S BEING HINDERED BY ITS LEADER; 
</P>
<P>
ARAFAT'S SUPPORT OF IRAQ SETS BACK PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and nominal 
president of a nonexistent Palestinian state, was jetting around the gulf 
recently and decided to drop in on one of the oil-rich sheikdoms that until now 
had always been pleased to receive him. This time things were different. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat's plane was flatly denied permission to land; only when its fuel began 
to run dangerously low was it finally allowed to put down in a nearby state. 
There was, however, a condition attached. Arafat was ordered not to leave the 
plane. His former friends, it seems, no longer wanted to see him. 
</P>
<P>
The story defines how Arafat's -- and the PLO's -- standing has sunk since the 
organization refused to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, an act of aggression 
that repelled most of the Arab world and terrified Kuwait's immediate 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO was one of only three members of the Arab League -- Iraq and Libya were 
the others -- that voted against supporting the U.N. embargo on Iraq and 
endorsing Saudi Arabia's invitation to American forces. 
</P>
<P>
It has long been noted of the PLO that it seldom misses an opportunity to miss 
an opportunity. By casting its lot with the most aggressively radical of the 
Arab regimes and simultaneously alienating some of its most important backers, 
the PLO has committed a major and perhaps crippling blunder. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat himself has probably thrown away whatever claim he had left in the 
non-Arab world to be accepted as a serious and responsible -- not to say 
trustworthy -- leader. When he issued his disavowal of further terrorism in 
Geneva in December, 1988 -- an essential prelude to the opening of a U.S.-PLO 
dialogue -- Arafat solemnly promised to respect the integrity and sovereignty 
of every Middle East state. The declaration was aimed at Israel, though Israel 
was never named, but its wording clearly covered all countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost all. As events showed, Kuwait was to be made an exception. The 
question is almost too painfully obvious to ask: If the PLO is ready to see 
Kuwait's borders violated and erased, how can its pledge to respect the borders 
of Israel ever be trusted? 
</P>
<P>
The PLO's siding with Iraq has of course done more than give those suspicious 
of the organization's intentions a new chance to say I-told-you-so. It has also 
done direct economic and political harm to Palestinians, those living in the 
gulf area -- 300,000 in Kuwait alone -- as well as those living under Israel's 
West Bank rule. 
</P>
<P>
By gratuitously putting itself in opposition to its longtime benefactors, the 
PLO has probably sacrificed most of the hundreds of millions of dollars a year 
in financial aid that it had been able to solicit or extort from Saudi Arabia 
and the other gulf states. Some of that money went to subsidize high living by 
PLO executives. But much of it went to needy Palestinians -- whose serious 
needs now seem certain to become all the more intense. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO, for all of its internal divisions and for all it has lost by offending 
its gulf bankers, along with Egypt and other moderate Arabs, remains the 
dominant voice in Palestinian affairs. The question is whether its unseemly and 
eager embrace of Saddam Hussein's aggression leaves it the Palestinians' most 
effective voice. The answer clearly seems to be no. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his colleagues have chosen to put themselves morally and politically 
on the wrong side of not just a dispute among Arabs -- as some Arabs would have 
it -- but of a confrontation that pits Iraq's despotic expansionism against the 
norms of international law. That's not going to be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat can go on claiming to be the Palestinians' leader. The Palestinians, who 
have a case that deserves the respectful attention of the world, deserve better 
than that.

BEER SALE BAN AT UCLA GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This fan got more exercised than the Bruin football team at the Rose Bowl on 
Sept. 8. Certain actions, supposedly taken out of consideration for public 
safety, apparently had more to do with making up for the loss of beer sale 
profits to UCLA and the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
As in past years, I had a "sipper cup" in my hand as I entered the gate. The 
gate staff told me containers were forbidden. I pointed out that the cup was 
empty, the temperature was 100 degrees and I wanted to drink water. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we'll sell you a bottle of water," they said, "but you'll have to check 
your container at the gate and pick it up after the game." Boy am I stupid! I 
cooperated. I anticipated a wait at the claim check booth and left the game 
early. After standing in line for 30 minutes, I handed in my claim check and 
was told by the girl, "Oh yeah, I remember seeing one like that, but it's not 
here now." 
</P>
<P>
I've promised myself that I will not spend one nickel at the concessions stands 
this year. Next year, they'll probably ban bringing food into the stadium, but 
that's OK because I don't plan on renewing my season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the sanctimonious talk about encouraging a "family" atmosphere at 
the Rose Bowl, the real driver here was the profit motive. 
</P>
<P>
Alums can still get loaded on beer for a buck at the private party in the 
parking lot and hypocrisy, not football, is the name of the game.

COURTING A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
NEW STUDY MAKES A COMPELLING CASE FOR MORE CIVIL-COURT JUDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ancient ritual among people who enjoy the protection of even the most 
primitive system of law is poking fun at the system. The Romans had a saying, 
"The more law, the less justice." But, joking aside, the current state of the 
civil courts in Los Angeles County is simply no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
A new RAND Corp. study shows a congealing of movement of civil cases in 
Superior Court that should alarm anyone worried about making our justice system 
work. For there is little difference in a society based on constitutional 
rights between the consequences of a loss of respect for the law and a loss of 
faith in it. 
</P>
<P>
Some statistics tell the story dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, the number of plaintiffs who have been willing to wait for a trial 
rather than settle out of court or drop a case altogether has plunged by more 
than half and is lower than in many other states. In that same time, civil case 
filings have doubled, and the time it takes to actually get into court has 
grown to nearly five years. There are more judges than in 1970, but Los Angeles 
still needs 106 more just to keep the backlog of cases from growing next year. 
On top of that, the county would need 66 temporary judges or commissioners to 
spend two years dealing with backlogged cases. 
</P>
<P>
The RAND study, one of many valuable ones it has produced on public 
institutions in recent years, says that improved management of cases has helped 
but that more improvements are possible. 
</P>
<P>
One existing experiment directed by the state Legislature is "fast track" 
management, where one judge moves a case from start to finish, much like the 
federal system. The fast-track style is being tested in Los Angeles, Orange and 
San Diego counties. RAND now proposes adding other experiments, including 
having judges spend more time at the outset on cases likely to go to trial and 
less on those likely to be settled. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers maneuvering for tactical advantage also contribute to delays. But the 
most important reason for what RAND calls a "severe" problem is another law 
entirely: that of supply and demand. There is too large a demand for court 
services and too small a supply of judges. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the burden of financing Superior courts has been shifted to Sacramento 
in recent years. In one sense, the judicial shortage is just another reason to 
review priorities for allocating scarce resources. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a question to be taken lightly because, in a very real sense, 
confidence in the legal system is a condition of faith in society.

GUN LAWS AND VIOLENT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial cites a few recent events and then calls for "more effective gun 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
There are already laws against everything you mentioned. It is illegal to "pack 
a piece," to threaten anyone with a gun, to shoot guns in public, etc. Most 
gang members have criminal records preventing them from legally even owning a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
Our problem is not needing more laws -- it is enforcement of existing laws. 
Tougher judges, more prisons, the death penalty, etc. are the solutions. Why 
doesn't The Times take the lead on these issues? Without enforcement and 
punishment, laws are useless. Our gang and drug problems are proof of that.

GUN LAWS AND VIOLENT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have two suggestions in response to your editorial. First, mandate gun safety 
courses in schools to teach safe and responsible use of guns. 
</P>
<P>
As a shock lesson, show films of the real damage that can be inflicted with a 
gun. Second, restrict the use of guns and the distorted portrayal of their 
effects on television and in movies. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is in gun education, not gun legislation.

CONRAD ON NIXON LIBRARY WING

<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Conrad is awesome! His ability in a single cartoon to puncture the hoopla 
and hype of contemporary political culture borders on sheer genius. 
</P>
<P>
However, his cartoon depicting a proposed new wing of the Nixon Library as a 
prison named after convicted Watergate accomplices includes the name Mardian. 
In fact, Robert Mardian's conviction of Watergate wrongdoing was overturned on 
appeal.

On the Ropes: Sugar Ray Leonard, who rarely lost in the ring, has been dealt a 
blow in divorce court. Judge William Miller in Rockville, Md., has ruled that 
Leonard must turn over financial records to attorney Marvin Mitchelson, who is 
representing Leonard's wife, Juanita. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson, asked if he is concerned about facing the pugilist, quipped: "If I 
was in the ring, I would be."

Dog Design: Barbara Bush was presented in Washington late last week with an 
outfit specially designed for White House dog Millie. The outfit, designed by 
Denise Ervin, includes a pink satin quilted jacket tufted with pearls and gold 
trim and pajama pants. And does it have a pearl necklace, like the kind Bush 
herself wears? Yes, indeed.

Cooked Book: Washington author Adrian Havill is writing a book on sports empire 
builder Jack Kent Cooke, but Havill thinks the self-made, often-abrasive owner 
of the Washington Redskins may not cooperate on a book he doesn't control. 
Asked what kind of response he expects from Cooke to requests for interviews, 
Havill said in Washington: "I may get a one-sentence letter -- 'May you rot in 
hell!' "

Rancho Resale: A New Hampshire real estate company plans to buy the former 
ranch-commune home of the late Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Hanover 
Investment Corp. put down an undisclosed deposit on the 64,229-acre, $6-million 
central Oregon property, which the firm may turn into a health spa. The commune 
folded in 1985, after the Rolls Royce-loving Rajneesh was convicted of 
immigration fraud and deported to India, where he died in January.

What a Really Big Shoe: Ed Sullivan will be back on television for the first 
time since 1971, when the legendary CBS Sunday night variety series was 
canceled after 23 years. Producer-director Andrew Solt said last week he had 
purchased every episode of "The Ed Sullivan Show" and is negotiating with 
syndicators and networks for a series and a two-hour special featuring 
excerpts. BETH KLEID

'HARDWARE': RELENTLESS HIGH-TECH BLOOD BATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hardware" (citywide) isn't a movie that can be comfortably recommended to 
anyone but hard-core sci-fi movie violence buffs: people for whom the sine qua 
non of cinema is "The Terminator," "Blade Runner" or "RoboCop." But they'll 
probably like it, perhaps even elevate it to minor cult status. 
</P>
<P>
It's a relentless, banging, slashing, robo-trap of a movie: a lady-in-distress 
thriller about a dystopic future Britain, in which the world has succumbed to 
nuclear holocaust and lies submerged in eternal reddish dusty haze, in which 
scavengers prowl deserts, while a scabrous radio deejay (the ferocious Iggy 
Pop) screams out cynical diatribes. People huddle behind triple-locked metal 
doors and barter the shards of a smashed society. And the wreckage that one 
scavenger brings back to his junk-artist wife proves part of a self-repairing 
military robot, which has become that horror movie staple: the bogeyman you 
can't kill. 
</P>
<P>
That's what limits the movie: the whole over-familiar form of the unkillable 
monster-splatter-thriller. Though it works here, it constricts the story. 
"Hardware" isn't long on ideas, emotions or character; it degenerates into a 
mindless slaughterhouse crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
But, given obvious limitation of means and budget, it's executed with murderous 
kinetic intensity and considerable mean, glitzy style. Writer-director Richard 
Stanley is someone to watch. He gets impressive performances from his 
beleaguered heroine (Stacey Travis) and one fat sybarite of a voyeur-villain 
(William Hootkins) and he creates a consistent grim, paranoid tone, a world 
almost as all-of-a-piece as the post-Apocalypse desert of "Road Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
The flaws of "Hardware" are the inherent blemishes of the techno-thriller 
genre: It treats its blood baths as if they were endless choruses in a Rolling 
Stones rocker, it reduces life to rhythm, event to a crushing cataract of 
images. 
</P>
<P>
You have to be somewhat inured to its all-out violence: the accelerating 
assaults, cliff-hangers and gory decapitations that initially earned this 
R-rated film (for extreme violence, language, nudity and sex) an X. But it's 
not without ideas. "This is what you want, this is what you get," drones under 
the credits, obviously Stanley's point. Insane exaggerations and all, this 
barbarous hell of wanton destruction and bleak post-industrial Darwinism is 
what may face us. That nasty notion pulls "Hardware" up above all but a 
fraction of its competition in the techno-thriller blood-bath sweeps. MICHAEL 
WILMINGTON

'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' Wins: British playwright Tom Stoppard won the 
Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion Award Saturday for his first film, 
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead." 
</P>
<P>
The jury, headed by American writer Gore Vidal, announced the award for 
Stoppard's screen version of his 1966 stage fantasy about two minor characters 
in Shakespeare's "Hamlet." Martin Scorsese's gangster movie "GoodFellas" won 
the Silver Lion Award for best director. The jury awarded a special prize to 
director Jane Campion of New Zealand for "An Angel at My Table." BETH KLEID

MELISSA ETHERIDGE PUTS BLUES, LEVITY INTO FOLK, ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Melissa Etheridge's most popular songs is "No Souvenirs," but don't tell 
that to the merchants in the Wiltern Theatre lobby, who were doing a reasonable 
business Saturday during the opening of her four-day stand. Many of the shirts 
and scarves were emblazoned with the title of her year-old gold album, "Brave 
and Crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Some other equally appropriate manifestoes, suitable for album title or 
T-shirt, came to mind -- like "Co-Dependent and Bluesy" or "Obsessive and 
Raspy." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Raitt may be the pre-eminent blueswoman in pop music nowadays, and 
Etheridge, a former folkie who still usually strums an acoustic guitar in front 
of her minimal band, can hardly be said to work in that genre. 
</P>
<P>
But she's got the tenor of the blues down as pat as any prominent female rocker 
out there,in her own '70s-based, singer-songwriterly style. 
</P>
<P>
She has also learned to be wary of those who would type her as a perpetual 
"wronged woman," even if that is part and parcel of the cathartic blues well 
she gets her sustenance from. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through Saturday's show, Etheridge began introducing a song from her 
debut album that she claimed she was reluctant to continue to perform. It 
reinforces, she said, the public misunderstanding of her image as a self-made 
victim who thrives on romantic torture. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, she began describing a lonely situation -- "Pretty soon all you've 
got is you, yourself and your precious pain." And with that, she launched 
unabashedly into the ballad of that name, which, as might be expected, 
romanticizes the hurt of heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
It's a narrow canvas indeed that Etheridge paints on, and whether you see it as 
unduly tragic or not, it's a mightily self-obsessed one as well in this day of 
social consciousness. On the other hand, her second album marks a great leap 
forward from her first, being less a pity party of the "Precious Pain" sort and 
more a rich, involving, personal exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, her persona takes on a distinctly different color live thanks to her 
consistent playfulness, be it in a dramatic dart of the eyes or a witty turn of 
her terrific barroom growl. The needed levity is more clearly there on stage. 
</P>
<P>
At least two-thirds of Saturday's sold-out crowd was female, extremely unusual 
for a rock show, New Kids concerts and other under-18 attractions withstanding. 
They no doubt respond to Etheridge's dual qualities of victim-ness and defiant 
aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't Etheridge's most triumphant night as a performer. The set was 
almost identical to the one last October when she headlined five nights at the 
Roxy, and it's no surprise that she doesn't have quite as much fire to put into 
the same material after another year's worth of touring. Her highly charged 
version of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" -- sandwiched between "Bring Me Some 
Water" and "Like the Way I Do," her two most favored numbers -- is now, as 
then, the highlight of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Martin Stephenson &amp; the Daintees is the opening act on most of 
Etheridge's tour. Their Celtic-soul-influenced set picked up extraordinary 
steam in its last two numbers with the introduction of an all-important tuba. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Wiltern shows on Tuesday and Wednesday, Etheridge plays Saturday at the 
Santa Barbara County Bowl.

RUTH BROWN STEALS THE SHOW AT BLUES FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Stormy Monday" figured to be a mighty popular song at the 11th annual Long 
Beach Blues Festival at Cal State Long Beach on Saturday. This year's event was 
dedicated to T-Bone Walker, who wrote that classic blues, but none of 
Saturday's headliners mentioned Walker. Nor were there any references to 
another Texas blues guitarzan, the late Stevie Ray Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
The attendance, officially estimated at 10,000 but looking a little more, was 
the largest first-day crowd since the event expanded to two days in 1984. 
Headliners Johnny Winter's and Bo Diddley's drawing power with rock fans 
probably accounted for the turnout, but the day's high point was R&amp;B queen 
Ruth Brown, whose smooth, horns-and-organ sound downplayed six-string heroics. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran singer completely captivated the audience. Brown, who opens a 
two-week engagement at the Cinegrill at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on 
Tuesday, has been riding high on the strength of the Broadway hit "Black and 
Blues," and her 40-minute set Saturday came straight from the 
blueswoman-as-font-of-wisdom school. 
</P>
<P>
Brown played to her audience, mentioning late-'40s artists Buddy Johnson and 
Ella Johnson, who were undoubtedly unfamiliar to the Diddley-Winter crowd. But 
vintage Brown hits like "5-10-15 Hours" and a final double-entendre blues, "If 
I Can't Sell It, I'm Going to Sit on It," galvanized the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Diddley's half-hour set was a major letdown. Bo may know Diddley but apparently 
he still doesn't know how to find a backing band that can play even a passable 
Bo Diddley rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Winter's hourlong headlining set was a time capsule that could have 
happened back in his blues trio days 20 years ago. The heavily tattooed albino 
guitarist put his signature cascade of notes on an assortment of originals and 
standards like Robert Johnson's "Kind Hearted Woman." 
</P>
<P>
His blues feel is undeniable, but Winter's solos always sound like the full 
repertory of licks that could possibly be played in a given solo -- he leaves 
everything in, where others might edit phrases out. Also appearing were Lonnie 
Mack, the Bernie Pearl Blues Band and the festival talent search winner, Beto 
Lovato &amp; the Neato Banditos.DON SNOWDEN

NEW KIDS PRESIDE AT RITE OF PASSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember those stadium-filling weddings the Rev. Sun Myung Moon used to 
perform? Something similar happened on Friday at the New Kids on the Block show 
at Dodger Stadium. But it was more like a mass bas mitzvah or a confirmation, 
as thousands of pre- and barely pubescent girls experienced a major modern rite 
of passage: their first pop concert. 
</P>
<P>
The shrieking, the staging, the lasers, the fireworks, the heavily pitched 
souvenirs, what could be heard of the music and -- most importantly -- the 
puppy-love sex-tease of the New Kids, bare-chested and wiggling their rears. . 
. . It'll all be part of the conversations that Nychol Thornton, 13, and her 
sister Jennifer, 12, said would fill the schoolyard at Sandberg Junior High in 
Glendora today. (For the record, both said they like hard rockers Faith No More 
better, but that their favorite New Kids are Jonathan and Joe, respectively.) 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this was also a rite of passage for many accompanying parents. Some 
marked the occasion by waiting glumly in the parking lot, others sitting 
silently with their children, bemused and/or perturbed, with fingers in ears. 
But Anthony and Anita Marco of Lomita beamed proudly as daughter Mandy, 10, 
jumped and clapped and screamed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen her unwind like this," said her dad. He reminisced about his

"The New Kids are leading them in a safe direction," he said. "These kids can 
loosen up without all the cultural things we went through in the '60s and 
'70s."

They also did it without the food fights of their older siblings that marred 
concerts here by Depeche Mode last month and the Cure last summer. But just 
wait until adolescence sets in. STEVE HOCHMAN

ROBERT WILSON STAGES AN ABSTRACT VISION OF 'ALCESTE' IN CHICAGO

Remember Robert Wilson? Remember his "CIVIL warS," the 12-hour, $7-million 
avant-garde quasi-opera that was supposed to be the highlight of the Olympic 
Arts Festival in Los Angeles back in 1984? 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately the victim of a financial fiasco, Wilson's magnum opus never made it 
to Shrine Auditorium. In fact, it has never been performed in toto anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Wilson has rebounded with an imposing series of productions that 
have become the rage -- literally and figuratively -- of Italy, Germany and 
France. It is only in his own conservative country that the designing director 
from Waco, Tex., remains something of a prophet without honor. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually that could change, thanks in part to Ardis Krainik, the enterprising 
impresaria of the Chicago Lyric Opera. Friday night, when she opened the local 
opera season, she could have soothed the 3,500 savage breasts in attendance 
with something familiar and easy -- something like the sleepy "La Boheme" that 
will inaugurate the Met season next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Krainik likes to think modern, on occasion. She likes to think dangerous. 
She also likes to think glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, she had invited Peter Sellars to stage a revolutionary 
"Tannhauser" and Yuri Lyubimov to direct a provocative "Lulu." Under the 
circumstances, no one could have been shocked to learn that she had brought 
Wilson home to update the noble formulas, anno 1776, of Gluck's "Alceste." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's interpretation of the opera had been controversial when it was 
introduced in Stuttgart four years ago, with Dunja Vejzovic in the title role. 
It will, no doubt, remain controversial here, with Jessye Norman portraying the 
sacrificial heroine. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this is not an "Alceste" for historical purists. Wilson does not go 
for baroque. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks in terms of monumental abstraction. He plays with scrims on a bare 
stage, ornamented with modernist symbols. Symmetrical shafts of color define 
the playing areas. An ever-changing cube rotates mysteriously on wires in the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
Outfitted in stark costumes by Joachim Herzog that defy period identification, 
the cast either freezes in stylized agony or glides through the open space in 
mechanical slow-motion. The chorus is banished to the pit, while an ensemble of 
dancers -- trained by Suzushi Hanayagi -- tries to convey expressive urgency in 
body language that fuses Grahamesque contortion with Kabuki ritual with basic 
semaphore. 
</P>
<P>
The statuesque protagonist, draped magnificently and generously in crimson, 
enjoys the services of a dramatic alter ego -- a dancer in white who mimes the 
diva's inner emotions. At what used to be the happy end, Wilson introduces the 
shock of ambiguity, leaving Alceste alone and possibly forsaken on her own 
doorstep. She enjoys no blissful reunion with her husband, Admete, who -- as 
played by Chris Merritt -- resembles a clumsy, giant automaton. 
</P>
<P>
Mercifully, the directing auteur lowers the curtain before there can be any 
celebration. The cliche of the final festive dances is cut. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson invokes simple, strikingly beautiful, remarkably fluid images. He 
creates exquisitely outlined, impeccably balanced compositions. In 
collaboration with Jennifer Tipton, he paints with light. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't invariably responsive, however, to the dynamic pulse of the score, or 
even to the text. His choreographic mannerisms, when executed by ordinary 
singers rather than inspired actors, can tend toward the risible. In his 
mythological arena, a thin line separates character and caricature. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one must applaud the boldness of his imagination, not to mention the 
stubborn clarity of his vision. Wilson stimulates the viewer, even when he 
blithely contradicts the source. 
</P>
<P>
The dressy Chicago audience applauded politely. If one noted any grumbling, it 
involved the absence of the now de rigueur supertitles. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson refused to allow his carefully gauged stage pictures to be adorned with 
captions. He did compromise on the projection of a few expository sentences at 
the beginning of each scene, but even these malfunctioned in Act II. 
</P>
<P>
The musical elements proved less compelling than the theatrical impulses. Gary 
Bertini conducted with busy competence, without hinting at a unifying 
perspective of the score or demonstrating much concern for the inherent Gallic 
style. 
</P>
<P>
The title role has flattered such diverse divas as Germaine Lubin, Marjorie 
Lawrence, Kirsten Flagstad, Maria Callas, Eileen Farrell, Heather Harper and 
Janet Baker. Norman moved through the physical and vocal platitudes with 
self-conscious grandeur and considerable dignity. Although she sang the 
introspective passages with exquisite, sensuous point, especially at mid-range, 
she was severely taxed by the heroic outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
Merritt partnered her conscientiously as a bigger-than-life Admete, and sang 
with power that never flagged at high altitudes. Suavity, alas, is not his 
forte. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast included John Brandstetter as the High Priest, Mark S. Doss 
as Hercule, Henry Runey as Thanatos and Gary Lehman as Apollon. All turned out 
to be competent. None mustered sufficient magnetism to compete successfully 
with Wilson's scenery.

'REVOLUCION' SHOWCASES EAST L.A. TROUPE

Just in time for Mexican Independence Day, the East L.A. Choreographers 
Showcase offered a reprise of Carola de la Rocha's ambitious pageant, "La 
Revolucion," in the cozy Playhouse at Cal State Los Angeles. Nearly 30 members 
of her Los Angeles Mexican Dance Company traced, in dance terms reminiscent of 
"The Red Detachment of Women," the transition from aristocracy to people's 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with barely a pause, the fledgling folkloric group performed its take on 
a traditional "Danza del Venado," with Alfonso Escalante as the skittish deer 
and a brilliantly costumed tableau, "Matachines," choreographed by Rocha and 
associate director Victor M. Durazo. 
</P>
<P>
They've come a long way since last year's show on a bare platform at the Casa 
del Mexicano. Properly supported by the production crew, the company, whose 
founders hail from the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, displayed the rewards of 
diligent application to traditional and original material. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the evening consisted of nine short dances, three of them by the 
concert's producer, Frank Guevara. Ranging from the mawkishly sensuous 
"Recuerdo" to the aptly titled "Strictly Commercial," his slick work bracketed 
offerings by six other artists. Most of these worked to popular tunes in styles 
derived from music and workout videos. Snatches of voguing, street dance 
offered by a very young ensemble under the direction of Domino Fernandez and 
Louis J. Vela's production number rounded out a remarkably diverse program.

<P>
While the L.A. Festival billed a coming together of the world's culture, Rachel 
Rosenthal concerned herself with continental drift: a process that began 250 
million years ago when all land was a single mass named Pangaea. 
</P>
<P>
But since the mere exploration of eco-geography would not satisfy a performance 
artist of such solipsistic bent, Rosenthal used the above as a metaphor for her 
own disintegration Friday at the Santa Monica Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what gears and goads Rosenthal in most of her compelling, 
hyper-stimulated work, and especially in this latest epic, "Pangaean Dreams," 
is a need to plant herself in the cosmos and divulge the findings -- through 
sociopolitical commentary and fearlessly funny self-psychoanalysis ("I'm a gay 
man locked in a woman's body; feminists are women who resent not being men"). 
</P>
<P>
No scale is too grand to encompass. On a "shamanistic journey" she wafts 
through drugless but demonic altered states. Autosuggestion brings this 
daughter of Wotan to an encounter with Gaia, the Earth Goddess "who gives birth 
to and devours herself." 
</P>
<P>
And all of it is ingeniously realized through Rosenthal's great craft and 
virtuosity. Taking both parts of a dialogue between Pain and its Victim, she 
personifies the ferocious beast with a grizzled realism. 
</P>
<P>
But it is humor -- a hip, sardonic, tough-guy type -- that ultimately keeps 
"Dreams" from lapsing into unrelieved melodrama, as well as Leslie Lashinsky's 
superb musical collaboration and Dain Olsen's videos.DONNA PERLMUTTER

<P>
Of all the companies to have appeared in this sprawling populist picnic that 
was the L.A. Festival, few worked their way into our hearts and minds as 
unself-consciously as the Bread and Puppet Theater of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
That group's final show, "The Uprising of the Beast," took place over the 
weekend in a giant hangar at the Santa Monica Air Center before a sold-out 
audience of more than 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
They had all they could do to keep up with constantly shifting playing areas 
(Bread and Puppet is running-shoe theater; you earn your rewards). But the 
chase Saturday delivered a visually arresting, morally chastening plea for more 
sanity in the conduct of our lives, more respect for our planet and our fellow 
creatures on it. 
</P>
<P>
It was not always a pretty sight. After a lighthearted pre-show outside the 
hangar, the huge doors parted and the audience followed the company inside. 
There, its members were introduced to a large family of endearing goats that 
were eventually attacked, wrenched from their young (to simulated screams) and 
subjected to the rituals of the slaughterhouse. In the end, there was a mass 
insurrection and a quaking of the Earth during which dining tables rattled, and 
a Divinity (that shapes our ends?) swooped from the rafters to protect, reject, 
embrace all naked and misguided souls. 
</P>
<P>
A large, printed manifesto warned of the doom we are negotiating unless we mend 
our ways, ending the proceedings on a poetic, quasi-spiritual, quasi-didactic, 
quasi-beatific note. 
</P>
<P>
All was not perfect. The undefined playing areas caused some traffic jams. The 
audience did not always know where it was supposed to be and sometimes got in 
the way of the players. As peripatetic as this show gets, B&amp;P seemed less 
well in charge of crowd management if not control (which it would find 
abhorrent). 
</P>
<P>
But of all the festival shows that B&amp;P presented, this was the most 
technically and philosophically complex -- a more finely engineered, if still 
deliberately paced, ceremonial theater of images. 
</P>
<P>
The giant 40-foot puppet representing the enfolding Divinity was manipulated by 
a sophisticated network of pulleys. The systematic slaughter of the goats was 
achieved with another pulley device that slipped the goat's head and "hide" off 
its frame leaving a cowering skeleton behind. The slaughterhouse butchers, in 
blindfolds and bloodied aprons, looked intentionally like executioners. 
</P>
<P>
It was no accident that the piece is subtitled "The 1989 Insurrection 
Oratorio." An a cappella chorus was an integral part of the performance, along 
with the B&amp;P's unconventional mix of percussion and music. As usual, the 
company employed traditional instruments combined with others made out of 
nothing less imaginative than a chain touching a hubcap or an old Pepsi can 
rattling with seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everything this company of rags and tatters utilizes is the clever 
recycling of something else. 
</P>
<P>
The climax of "Uprising" found the company leaving the hangar in an emblematic 
"boat" of blue and white cloth borrowed from the show they did at Griffith Park 
called "The Same Boat." Advancing hordes -- a strong image -- consisted of 
painted flats made of nothing more mystique-laden than corrugated cardboard. 
When artistic director Peter Schumann says he believes in Cheap Art he's not 
talking out of both sides of his mouth, even if he does play two trumpets at 
once that way. 
</P>
<P>
Although this company -- a 30-year-old national treasure -- has toured the 
world over, this L.A. Festival engagement was the first time it was invited to 
be part of an American festival or of our city. Let's not wait another 30 to 
invite it back.

A PASSIONATE RENDITION OF ALLENDE'S SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In "El Gran Circo de Chile" at the Santa Monica Pier Saturday and Sunday, 
Rodolfo Pulgai looked remarkably like the late president Salvador Allende, the 
leftist president of Chile from 1970 to 1973, and masterfully expressed the 
man's rare moments of relaxation as well as his gravity and his passion. 
</P>
<P>
Like its acclaimed romance, "La Negra Ester," El Gran Circo Teatro de Chile and 
director Andres Perez Araya adapted their commedia style to the story about 
Allende. It was presented in Spanish in many short scenes, with a fiercely 
emphatic acting style. The action was almost always accompanied by a driving, 
haunting musical score, performed live with remarkable delicacy and precision 
by Guillermo Aste and Jorge Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
The set design, by Eduardo Feuerhake, was even more spartan than that for 
"Ester," consisting of a red carpet for most of the action, a narrow curtain at 
the back of the stage that was scaled as well as opened, and a coppery backdrop 
that perhaps was a subtle reminder of the role of copper in Chile's economy and 
Allende's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
However, another important contributor to Allende's troubles, the United States 
as represented by the CIA, was hardly mentioned. The English-language synopsis 
indicated a scene in which Richard Nixon vowed to thwart Allende, but it was 
omitted from the opening-night performance. A festival spokesman, quoting a 
company member, reported that the scene was "cut fairly early in the rehearsal 
process" for the show, which made its bow 20 days ago in Zurich, and there are 
no plans to restore it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a baffling omission, considering how much U.S. citizens have heard about 
their government's intervention in Chile. Perhaps it was simply decided to keep 
the show as Chilean as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the English language synopsis was inadequate; it covered only the 
first half of the show and omitted most of the essential historical background. 
</P>
<P>
Rented headsets offered a live translation, but publicity about this service 
was virtually non-existent, and some of the potential renters remained unaware 
of the headsets until the show was over. 
</P>
<P>
There was no intermission, which might have helped non-Spanish speakers 
discover the headsets -- and given everyone a break from the bleacher-style 
seating.

SPECIAL SCREENING: LEWIS KLAHR'S VINTAGE GRAPHICS TELL 'FUTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For his highly evocative "Tales of the Forgotten Future," which Filmforum 
screens tonight at 8 at LACE, filmmaker Lewis Klahr digs into a treasure-trove 
of vintage graphics to bring the past alive with a powerful emotional effect. 
</P>
<P>
A master of decoupage, Klahr cuts out figures from old magazines, comic books, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
-- the list of his source materials is endless -- and animates them against 
backgrounds of photographs, engravings and so on. 
</P>
<P>
However, for all its reprocessing and layering, his work is fundamentally a 
rigorous example of achieving maximum impact through minimal means. 
</P>
<P>
What he achieves is two-fold: to evoke the American experience through popular 
culture, especially of the '40s and '50s, and to tell us little stories, often 
merely narrative fragments, to create the effect of eavesdropping on life. 
</P>
<P>
He takes us into the idealized, homogenous world of advertising and 
commercials, in which everyone is WASP-y, well-dressed and well-fed, only to 
reveal beneath impeccable surfaces a whole range of emotions -- fear, 
loneliness, sexual craving. 
</P>
<P>
Most poignant is the endless parade of pert, smiling Jon Whitcomb/Barbie 
doll-like creatures, calling attention to an image that straitjacketed a 
generation (or two) of young American women.

ETHNIC VIOLENCE: XHOSA CHIEF JOINS IN ON THE UNUSUAL APPEAL. RALLIES OCCUR IN 
THE MIDST OF A POLICE CRACKDOWN.

<TEXT>
<P>
The traditional leader of the Zulus, King Goodwill Zwelithini, traveled far 
from the center of his kingdom Sunday to urge thousands of his followers at 
rallies to "put out the fires of violence." 
</P>
<P>
"I have come to tell my father's people . . . that I, as king of the Zulus, 
will not tolerate violence perpetrated in the name of" the Zulu nation, said 
Zwelithini, a highly respected figure among South Africa"s 7 million Zulus. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody must lay down their arms and take their brother's hand in 
friendship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zwelithini was joined by Xhosa paramount chief Tutor Ndamase in the unusual 
appeal at rallies in Soweto and Tokoza, south of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
A month of fighting in those and other area townships, which has killed nearly 
800, has been primarily between Zulu supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party 
and Xhosa and other followers of the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Ndamase appealed to the crowds to look behind their differences, which he said 
were being stoked by unknown people out to upset the country's peace process. 
</P>
<P>
"Freedom is your goal, not bloodshed," he said. "Unity is your goal, not 
division. Power is your goal, not this bloody weakness." He added: "We must 
refuse to be used. Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
However, attendance at the rallies was overwhelmingly Zulu. Thousands armed 
with homemade spears and shields arrived under police escort. No efforts were 
made to disarm them. Police said later that they had agreed to allow 
"traditional weapons," but no machetes or axes. Some more dangerous weapons 
were seen, however. 
</P>
<P>
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok visited the Tokoza rally and later spoke 
with residents at the nearby Phola Park squatter camp, where 800 shacks have 
been burned down and dozens have died in six attacks by Zulus. Militant ANC 
supporters in Phola Park have driven Zulus out of a migrant worker hostel, 
which has now closed, and they also have attacked and killed passers-by whom 
they suspect of being Zulus. 
</P>
<P>
The rallies occurred in the midst of a police crackdown on the violence. 
Roadblocks were set up at township entrances, police helicopters circled 
overhead, and a heavy police presence was evident. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities reported no serious incidents. Two burned bodies were found in 
Tokoza on Sunday morning and a man in Soweto was stabbed and burned to death on 
Saturday by a mob of ANC supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The show of Zulu force and the king's remarks worried some township residents. 
Although Zwelithini said the "killing talk" must end, he drew cheers when he 
added that the Zulu nation "will not, I repeat not, be forced out of 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
Zwelithini added, however, that "any tendency for Zulus to strike out at Xhosas 
and Xhosas to do likewise must be eliminated now." 
</P>
<P>
Inkatha, led by Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, is the ANC's main political rival. 
The ANC has support among most ethnic groups, including Zulus, but Xhosas hold 
many important leadership positions. Zulu supporters of the two groups have 
been locked in a three-year battle in Natal Province that has killed nearly 
4,000.

THOUSANDS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST PREMIER IN MOSCOW; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S RESIGNATION ECHO OFF THE KREMLIN'S 
WALLS. THE RALLY IS UNPRECEDENTED.

<P>
Thousands of demonstrators, protesting severe shortages of food and consumer 
goods, marched to the Kremlin on Sunday to demand that Premier Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov resign and a new government be appointed to carry out radical economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Ryzhkov, resign!" and carrying banners that declared "The Economy Is 
a Disaster," the demonstrators mounted a fierce attack on Ryzhkov, who has been 
premier since 1985, and denounced as "a betrayal of perestroika" his proposals 
for gradual transition to a market-based economy. 
</P>
<P>
The participants, who endorsed a resolution at the end of the rally, also 
criticized President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for "indecisiveness and 
inconsistency" and warned: "Gorbachev, you now have your last chance to be with 
your people!" 
</P>
<P>
Gavriil Popov, the Soviet capital's radical mayor, told the crowd gathered in 
Manezh Square just outside the Kremlin that the country is "living through the 
chain reaction of the collapse of an obsolete system" and said the Ryzhkov 
government was only prolonging the nation's agony. 
</P>
<P>
Popov, one of the most prominent of Soviet economists, called on the Supreme 
Soviet, the national legislature, to adopt the controversial program by which, 
in just 500 days, the country's economy would be transformed from state 
ownership and central planning to private entrepreneurship and market forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow mayor, who quit the Communist Party in July to protest what he 
called its conservatism, also called for a coalition government, including 
members of other parties and political movements, to replace the Ryzhkov 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet is expected this week to resume debating the "500-Day Plan" 
of Stanislav S. Shatalin, one of Gorbachev's economic advisers, and Ryzhkov's 
recent proposals. The rally was intended to step up pressure for adoption of 
the more radical program. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the relatively small turnout -- 10,000 to 12,000 people at the rally and 
perhaps twice that many marching the five miles through central Moscow in a 
cold drizzle -- deprived the radicals of the massive support they had earlier 
this year, when about 250,000 people took part in one protest demonstration and 
more than 100,000 joined another. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a political rally with cadenced shouts for the government's 
resignation echoing off the Kremlin walls and up into Red Square was 
unprecedented in Soviet history. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's promises are not and can never be fulfilled," Mikhail 
Poltoranin, the information minister of the Russian Federation, told the crowd. 
"Ryzhkov is loyal to the generals of the partocracy. He is a Trojan horse of 
those generals in the camp of perestroika. Nikolai Ivanovich (Ryzhkov) must, 
for once, become a man and say, 'I am quitting.' " 
</P>
<P>
The unremitting attack on Ryzhkov, 60, who had defended his policies on 
television Saturday evening, continued throughout the 90-minute rally. Sergei 
B. Stankevich, a political scientist who serves as Popov's deputy, called on 
him to "leave with peace." 
</P>
<P>
"Respected Nikolai Ivanovich," Stankevich said, addressing the Council of 
Ministers building just inside the Kremlin walls, "you did something useful for 
your country, but you have lost the main opportunities (for progress). Your 
three programs went bankrupt. We do not have revenge in our hearts, but our 
Mother Russia needs more than you can accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
By continuing in power, Stankevich said, the government was only compounding 
the crisis, because no one had confidence in it, no one would even accept that 
its proposals were perhaps mistaken but were put forward in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Stankevich was cheered, as were the other speakers, by a crowd of mostly 
middle-aged, middle class people. There were more maiden aunts and professors 
in berets than radical youths at the rally and in the march, and intellectuals 
and staff employees of the many government offices clearly outnumbered 
blue-collar workers and the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a government in whom we have faith, a premier who gives us hope," 
Natalya Boiko, a high school chemistry teacher, said as she marched down 
Tvarskaya Street (formerly Gorky Street) toward the Kremlin. "Ryzhkov's plan 
may have merits, but it will fail because no one believes in him." 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov, until now, has retained the confidence of Gorbachev, who appointed him 
premier in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
What the radicals sought to stress at the rally was that the economic crisis 
was too severe for half measures, that the time for compromise was past and 
that Ryzhkov, an industrial manager for most of his career, was yesterday's 
man. 
</P>
<P>
"We are moving to a catastrophe," Telman Gdlyan, a prominent radical deputy, 
told the rally. "Chaos and illegality have taken over the country, and it has 
become unmanageable. . . . There is no government in the country now -- they 
are just a puppet group fulfilling the orders of the president and the 
Communist Party's Central Committee." 
</P>
<P>
With social discontent rising amid creeping political paralysis, civil war and 
widespread bloodshed are quite possible, Gdlyan warned. "I do not exclude the 
possibility of a coup d'etat and the establishment of a military-party 
dictatorship," he said.

A toddler trapped for 14 hours in a shaft dug for a construction project busied 
himself making mud balls and listening to his mother sing nursery songs before 
rescuers reached him at dawn Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really difficult. 
</P>
<P>
I could hear him crying, but I couldn't touch him and I couldn't help him," 
Lisa Davis, mother of 20-month-old Kevin, told reporters as she fought back 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue workers cheered when the boy was brought to the surface shortly 
after 6 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"When he clenched my fingers, I felt a tingle in my heart," said firefighter 
Joe Cipri, who pulled him out. "It's still there." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin was taken to Denver General Hospital, where he was treated for mild 
hypothermia, dehydration and scrapes on his elbows. About eight hours later, he 
went home.

The head of security for deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega on 
Sunday abandoned Panama's Vatican Embassy, where he had taken refuge after last 
December's U.S. invasion, and immediately went into hiding, Panamanian 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The escape of Eliecer Gaytan, who was Noriega's chief bodyguard, prompted a 
full-scale manhunt by U.S. and Panamanian authorities, a local radio station 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Television news reports showed the embassy ringed by American troops and 
Panamanian police. 
</P>
<P>
Gaytan took refuge on Dec. 23 in the Vatican Embassy, joining Noriega, who 
later handed himself over to U.S. authorities to stand trial in Florida on 
drug-related charges. Gaytan remained for the next nine months.

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
In a videotaped address broadcast over Iraqi TV, President Bush said he has "no 
quarrel with the people of Iraq" but warned that "Iraq stands isolated and 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and 
America," Bush said. "In fact, it is Iraq against the world. . . . Let me say 
clearly, there is no way Iraq can win." The talk was followed by an Iraqi 
commentary in which Bush was called a liar who wants to be "dictator of the 
whole world." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the U.N. Security Council adopted another resolution condemning 
Iraqi actions, specifically the raids on French, Canadian and Belgian 
diplomatic compounds in Kuwait on Friday. The resolution was passed 
unanimously, 15-0. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister arrived in the Soviet Union. The official Tass 
news agency said he will sign a treaty re-establishing diplomatic ties broken 
more than 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of rapprochement, a senior Iranian delegation arrived in Iraq, 
apparently to discuss prisoner-of-war exchanges, border matters and the 
reopening of embassies. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
Israel displayed alarm at the proposal to sell Saudi Arabia $20-billion worth 
of U.S. weapons. Israel views the purchase as a security threat, and analysts 
said the deal could spark a MiddleEast arms race. Officials said Defense 
Minister Moshe Arens will raise the matter in talks today with his U.S. 
counterpart, Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank announced plans to increase its lending to the developing world 
over the next year and is exploring ways of helping nations hurt by the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
One just-announced effect of the U.N. blockade: Revenues from the Suez Canal 
will drop 10% this year, cutting into one of Egypt's main sources of badly 
needed foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
Hostage Front: 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis continued to flood into Saudi Arabia. An estimated 5,000 crossed the 
border over the weekend after Iraq opened it for the first time in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi soldiers confiscated all identity documents, including car registration 
forms, refugees said, apparently to make it difficult for anyone to return. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three more Americans fleeing the conflict arrived at the 
Baltimore-Washington Airport. 
</P>
<P>
And India continued an evacuation effort thought to be the largest ever. More 
than 150,000 Indian citizens are trapped in and near Iraq and Kuwait. A 50-bus 
convoy will begin running this week to evacuate about 2,600 Indians daily. 
Several hundred more will be taken home aboard a ship now headed for Iraq with 
10,000 tons of food and medicine for Indian refugees there.

ARAB LEAGUE OFFICIAL SEES NO HOPE FOR UNITY; 
</P>

MIDEAST: 'CONFLICTS HAVE SUBMERGED OUR SHARED PRIORITIES,' SAYS ENVOY WHO HAS

Describing the Arab world as "fragmented to a terrible and unprecedented degree 
by the events in the gulf," the man who for 11 years represented the Arab 
League in the United States and the United Nations has explained his recent 
resignation by saying that he sees no prospect that the league can recover its 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
Clovis Maksoud, a former Lebanese journalist, said in a telephone interview 
over the weekend that he will remain at his post until the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout my term of office I have looked upon the Arab League as the Arab 
national home," Maksoud said in a letter made public late last week. "Now the 
Arab house has fallen on itself, and the conflicts have submerged our shared 
priorities. Unable to rationalize or analyze these developments, I am no longer 
able to cope with them." 
</P>
<P>
His letter faulted Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, as well as Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait for immediately calling for U.S. troops, rather than seeking an "Arab 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, I cannot accept the violation of an established legality -- 
the invasion of Kuwait," the envoy wrote in a letter addressed to Chedli Klibi, 
who had earlier resigned as secretary general of the 22-member league. "On the 
other, I cannot accept the rush towards the internationalization of the crisis. 
The original action was wrong and the ensuing reaction is wrong. . . . I feel 
in all honesty unable to do my duty after the Arab world has been dragged into 
the depths and fragmented in such a way." 
</P>
<P>
The worst of it, Maksoud lamented in the telephone interview, is that what he 
considers Arab national interests -- such as Palestinian rights, the return of 
territories occupied by Israel and the restoration of Lebanon's unity -- will 
be indefinitely postponed by the clash in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"In 11 years here I have established some credibility," the normally buoyant 
Lebanese declared bitterly. "I can't say there is an Arab position on anything 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Maksoud said Lebanon's Prime Minister Salim Hoss has told him that Lebanon will 
ask other Arab states to join in calling for his withdrawal of the resignation.

TEXT OF BUSH'S TALK TO IRAQI PEOPLE: 'I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU WANT WAR'

<P>
Here is the text of President Bush's address to the people of Iraq, as released 
by the White House: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm here today to explain to the people of Iraq why the United States and the 
world community has responded the way it has to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. My 
purpose is not to trade accusations, not to escalate the war of words, but to 
speak with candor about what has caused this crisis that confronts us. Let 
there be no misunderstanding. We have no quarrel with the people of Iraq. I've 
said many times, and I will repeat right now, our only object is to oppose the 
invasion ordered by Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, your leadership made its decision to invade, an unprovoked attack on 
a small nation that posed no threat to your own. Kuwait was the victim; Iraq, 
the aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
And the world met Iraq's invasion with a chorus of condemnation, unanimous 
resolutions in the United Nations. Twenty-seven states, rich and poor, Arab, 
Muslim, Asian and African, have answered the call of Saudi Arabia and free 
Kuwait and sent forces to the gulf region to defend against Iraq. For the first 
time in history, 13 states of the Arab League, representing 80% of the Arab 
Nation, have condemned a brother Arab state. Today, opposed by world opinion, 
Iraq stands isolated and alone. 
</P>
<P>
I do not believe that you, the people of Iraq, want war. You've borne untold 
suffering and hardship during eight long years of war with Iran. A war that 
touched the life of every single Iraqi citizen. A war that took the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of young men, the bright promise of an entire generation. 
No one knows better than you the incalculable costs of war, the ultimate cost 
when a nation's vast potential and vital energies are consumed by conflict. No 
one knows what Iraq might be today, what prosperity and peace you might enjoy 
had your leaders not plunged you into war. 
</P>
<P>
Now, once again, Iraq finds itself on the brink of war. Once again, the same 
Iraqi leadership has miscalculated. Once again, the Iraqi people face tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein has told you that Iraqi troops were invited into Kuwait. That's 
not true. In fact, in the face of far superior force, the people of Kuwait are 
bravely resisting this occupation. Your own returning soldiers will tell you 
the Kuwaitis are fighting valiantly in any way they can. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and 
America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world. When (Soviet) President 
(Mikhail S.) Gorbachev and I met at Helsinki we agreed that no peaceful 
international order is possible if larger states can devour their neighbors. 
Never before has world opinion been so solidly united against aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, until the invasion of Kuwait, has the United States been opposed to Iraq. 
In the past, the United States has helped Iraq import billions of dollars worth 
of food and other commodities. And the war with Iran would not have ended two 
years ago without U.S. support and sponsorship in the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein tells you the occupation of Kuwait will benefit the poorer 
nations of the world. In fact, the occupation of Kuwait is helping no one and 
is now hurting you, the Iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor. 
Instead of acquiring new oil wells by annexing Kuwait, this misguided act of 
aggression will cost Iraq over $20 billion a year in lost oil revenues. Because 
of Iraq's aggression, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign workers are 
fleeing Kuwait and Iraq. They are stranded on Iraq's borders, without shelter, 
without food, without medicine, with no way home. These refugees are suffering, 
and this is shameful. 
</P>
<P>
But even worse, others are being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait. Hostage 
taking punishes the innocent and separates families. It is barbaric. It will 
not work. And it will not affect my ability to make tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
I do not want to add to the suffering of the people of Iraq. The United Nations 
has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the Iraqi people, but as a 
peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from Kuwait. That 
decision is in the hands of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The pain you now experience is a direct result of the path your leadership has 
chosen. When Iraq returns to the path of peace, when Iraqi troops withdraw from 
Kuwait, when that country's rightful government is restored, when all 
foreigners held against their will are released, then, and then alone will the 
world end the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps your leaders do not appreciate the strength of the forces united 
against them. Let me say clearly, there is no way Iraq can win. Ultimately, 
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
No one -- not the American people, not this President -- wants war. But there 
are times when a country, when all countries who value the principles of 
sovereignty and independence, must stand against aggression. As Americans, 
we're slow to raise our hand in anger and eager to explore every peaceful means 
of settling our disputes. But when we have exhausted every alternative, when 
conflict is thrust upon us, there is no nation on Earth with greater resolve or 
stronger steadiness of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The actions of your leadership have put Iraq at odds with the world community. 
But while those actions have brought us to the brink of conflict, war is not 
inevitable. It is still possible to bring this crisis to a peaceful end. 
</P>
<P>
When we stand with Kuwait against aggression, we stand for a principle well 
understood in the Arab world. Let me quote the words of one Arab leader -- 
Saddam Hussein himself: "An Arab country does not have the right to occupy 
another Arab country. God forbid, if Iraq should deviate from the right path, 
we would want Arabs to send their armies to put things right. If Iraq should 
become intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm another Arab state, the 
Arabs would be right to deploy their armies to check it." 
</P>
<P>
Those are the words of your leader, Saddam Hussein, spoken on Nov. 28, 1988, in 
a speech to Arab lawyers. Today, two years later, Saddam has invaded and 
occupied a member of the United Nations and the Arab League. The world will not 
allow this aggression to stand. Iraq must get out of Kuwait -- for the sake of 
principle, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the Iraqi people.

HUGE ENROLLMENT JUMPS IN SCHOOLS FORESEEN FOR '90S

<P>
Huge enrollment increases in California public schools will continue at least 
until the end of this decade, the state Department of Finance has predicted. 
</P>
<P>
New figures released Friday by the department's population unit show that 
enrollment in kindergarten through 12th grade will grow from almost 5 million 
this fall to 6.8 million in the fall of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The increase this year over 1989 was 193,000 pupils, which is 10,000 more than 
the department was projecting last May and almost 40,000 more than was 
predicted a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
These huge annual enrollment jumps are the underlying causes of problems such 
as overcrowded classes, the shaky financial condition faced by 20 to 30 school 
districts and a $5-billion backlog in unmet school construction needs. 
</P>
<P>
The department's population experts said the enrollment increases are due to a 
continuing rise in the state's birthrate, which has been climbing since 1974, 
and to continued heavy increase of out-of-staters moving to California. 
</P>
<P>
The highest projected percentage increase would be in Riverside County, where 
school enrollments are expected to increase by almost 107% -- from 201,600 this 
year to 417,100 in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County is expecting a 91% increase in the next 10 years, San 
Diego County 55%, Santa Barbara County 49%, Orange County 44%, Los Angeles 
County 36% and Ventura County 30%.

AFTER YEARS OF WORK, CHANGOVER HAPPENED IN HOURS

<P>
The construction of the Thomas F. Riley Terminal at John Wayne Airport may have 
taken years, but the switch from the old terminal to the new facility happened 
literally overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the last planes touched down for the last time at the Eddie Martin 
Terminal, work crews, airline managers and car rental agencies started racing 
the clock to get their new operations up and running in time for the 6 a.m. 
opening of the gleaming new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of the work of moving equipment, installing computers and 
stocking shops and restaurants had already been done in recent weeks, crews 
still had to put in a full night's work from late Saturday evening through the 
wee hours of Sunday morning to tie up loose ends and otherwise put the 
finishing touches on the nation's newest air transportation center. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a chronicle of the passing into history of the Eddie Martin 
Terminal, and the first fledgling steps in the new life of the Thomas F. Riley 
Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, 10 to 11 p.m.: Bernie Fougnie, senior supervisor of the night shift 
for Ogden Allied Security, which screens passengers and X-rays baggage at the 
airport, had already begun overseeing the transfer of metal detectors to the 
new terminal even before United Airlines Flight 997 from Chicago became the 
last plane to land at the old terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had a penny for every passenger that went through there," Fougnie 
said, pointing to the last metal detector to be shipped down the road. Fougnie 
might also have wished for a penny for each of his memories of the small 
waiting area where only ripped chairs and stuffed trash cans remained. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we were a close-knit family," he said. "In a bigger place like the new 
terminal you don't have the charm of a smaller place. It (the old terminal) 
holds a lot of memories." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was wistful about the impending passing of the old terminal, 
however. Jayne Mallette stood behind her counter at National Car Rental -- 
housed in a ramshackle trailer near the curb -- counting the last few minutes 
as workmen bustled around her, disconnecting terminals and moving furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"In here, the air conditioning works in the winter and it doesn't work in the 
summer," Malette said. "When (employees) wanted to eat before, we had to drive 
so far. Now there'll be restaurants and Pizza Hut, so we can just go right out 
(in the terminal) and eat. I cannot wait to get in there." 
</P>
<P>
At the next counter, Avis employees began packing away rental contracts which 
they were forced to fill out by hand while their computers were connected at 
their new location. Next door, USAir employees scrambled to move out a few 
computers, office furniture and other equipment, carefully but swiftly loading 
the gear into pickup trucks. For both airlines and car rental firms, the move 
was almost complete. 
</P>
<P>
11 to 11:30 p.m.: By 11:15, operations had all but ceased. The baggage carousel 
had stopped. The repetitive announcement informing travelers that "the white 
zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers -- no parking," was 
silenced. An airport worker used the now-useless public address system -- 
useless because there was no public to address -- to send forth an ominous 
message: "Mine is the last voice you'll ever hear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, his was not the last voice that boomed from the loudspeakers. At 
11:30, a disembodied voice delivered a message to the few employees left in the 
terminal. "Ladies and gentlemen," the voice intoned, "Elvis has left the 
building." 
</P>
<P>
The Eddie Martin Terminal was effectively out of business. And indeed, Elvis 
was no where to be found. 
</P>
<P>
Midnight to 2 a.m.: The Don Pardo wanna-bes continued their public address high 
jinks inside the new terminal. And while Elvis may have left the old building, 
he turned up in the new one -- or at least a pale imitation of him did, as a 
seemingly frustrated entertainer belted out his rendition of "Heartbreak Hotel" 
for all the building to hear, followed by not-bad imitations of Ronald Reagan, 
Michael Jackson and Pee-wee Herman. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the smiles and giggles of workers, the countdown toward 6 a.m. continued. 
On the upper level, the color-coded arrival/departure board was tested -- the 
"status" column on each screen showed two words that the airlines probably hope 
is an omen: "On time." The message at Gate 7, was also somewhat optimistic -- 
it read "Now Boarding" for an 8 a.m. USAir flight to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, security personnel ran tests on the X-ray scanners and metal detectors, 
which were on-line early to run checks on the handful of workers active in the 
gate areas. A "test bag" containing fake guns, replicas of bombs and other 
deadly devices proved the equipment worked -- the outlines of two pistols and a 
time bomb clearly showed up on the security screens. "This is the kind of stuff 
we don't want to find in the airport," a technician said. 
</P>
<P>
On the lower level, technicians for the car rental firms -- which seemed to 
have the most extensive jobs of the night -- began installing and connecting 
the all-important computer terminals. At National Car Rental, Jayne Mallette 
sorted out green-and-white signs reading "Next Position Please" and "Other 
Transactions," which were later stripped into a board above the counter. Sounds 
of drilling emanated from the otherwise quiet terminal as Hertz workers put the 
last touches on their facility. 
</P>
<P>
2 to 4 a.m.: Airports are usually associated with lots of hustle and bustle and 
sometimes downright chaos, but the Riley building was eerily quiet. The only 
sounds were a few scattered voices on the lower level and the gentle whirring 
of floor waxers run by the cleaning crews. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the customer-service areas were ready for the first travelers as 4 a.m. 
approached. Computers had been installed in most spots and were brought on 
line. A few clerks and managers started to leave, with a few others staying 
behind to hand over the reins to the morning shift. Security personnel quietly 
held down the fort, keeping eyes peeled for unauthorized intruders, but mostly 
biding time, waiting for the first passenger. 
</P>
<P>
4 to 5 a.m.: The security guards didn't have to wait long for the first 
passenger. He showed up at 4:15 a.m., nearly two hours before the terminal's 
scheduled opening and nearly five hours before his 9 a.m. flight to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my flight was going to be at 7 o'clock, now it's 9 o'clock," said 
Ronald M. Dreier, a Chicago resident who was in Orange County for a meeting of 
Century 21, explaining his pre-dawn arrival. 
</P>
<P>
OK -- but isn't 4:15 a little early to arrive even for a flight at 7 o'clock? 
Dreier was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy being at the airport earlier," he said. "Different strokes, right?" 
</P>
<P>
While Dreier was by far the first passenger at the airport, he didn't hold the 
distinction of being the first member of the public to be there. That prize 
went to Bob Morse, driver of Coast Yellow Cab Co. taxi No. 64. Morse, 
resplendent in a sort of Panama hat gone wild, drove up to the taxi stand at 4 
a.m. -- just a bit early for the first scheduled flight arrival at 7:25. 
</P>
<P>
So why did Morse show up 3 1/4 hours early? "For that spot," he said, pointing 
to first place in line at the curb beneath the sign marked, "Taxi Only." "I 
wanted that spot, and I got it." Half an hour later, a second cab arrived to 
take its place in line -- surprised, no doubt, that the honor of carrying the 
first fare out of the new terminal was already secured by somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
5 to 7 a.m.: With an hour left before its scheduled opening, the dormant 
terminal began to stir to life. Employees of restaurants, snack bars and shops 
began to arrive, quickly setting up shop for early-morning fliers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to answer your questions, but I just don't have the time," said Bob 
Elling, manager of the Orange Grill, as he hurried to load ice and wipe down 
the bar at the new restaurant. Still, Elling did find a minute to explain why 
he was so frenzied. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be the biggest thing in Orange County for a long time," he 
said. "This is a fantastic airport." 
</P>
<P>
Around the terminal, the final spit-and-polish touches were applied. 
Technicians checked the power at several gates, while restaurant workers 
started brewing coffee for the first bleary-eyed travelers. Airline counter 
clerks took their positions, and at 6 a.m., a few passengers started trickling 
into the airport. As the terminal officially opened, it was clear that 
everything had gone smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
7 to 8 a.m.: And then came the fog. 
</P>
<P>
Just after 7 a.m., a thick blanket of fog enshrouded the airport, leaving many 
to wonder if the textbook-perfect transition would be marred by an untimely act 
of nature. And while it did have a minor effect -- the first scheduled arrival, 
a Skywest flight from Los Angeles, didn't come in at 7:25, thereby delaying the 
7:35 departure of a Skywest flight to Fresno -- the fog did not prevent the 
first plane at the gate from leaving on time. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:22 a.m., an agent at Gate 12 made the pre-boarding announcement for Delta 
Flight 750 to Dallas-Ft. Worth and Tampa, Fla. Despite the fog, the passengers 
were quickly boarded. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:49, the first jetway ever used at John Wayne Airport rolled back from the 
plane, and a moment later, Delta Flight 750 taxied onto the runway. 
</P>
<P>
The transition from the antiquated terminal to the terminal that will carry 
Orange County into the 21st Century was successful. The operations of the new 
John Wayne Airport were officially under way. 
</P>
<P>
Postscript: Cab driver Bob Morse's industriousness paid off. At 7:51 a.m., he 
was seen driving off with the first passenger ever to hail a cab at the new 
terminal.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: IT'S DAY 1, AND 'EVERYBODY'S LOST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
From the new freeway exit ramp to John Wayne Airport, it was evident Sunday 
that the new Thomas F. Riley Terminal, its multiple parking areas and 
double-deck concourses for arriving and departing passengers would take some 
getting used to. 
</P>
<P>
A top-of-the line white BMW slowed to a near stop on the broad curving roadway 
as its driver leaned over to glance at the terminal's giant Quonset hut-style 
roof shimmering in the noon sun. There followed the sound of squealing brakes 
and a few vivid gestures. Yet even the impatient quickly found themselves among 
the befuddled as they darted this way and that, trying to determine exactly 
which parking lot or curb they needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's lost," said Stacy Purcell, an America West Airlines customer 
service representative who was barely able to contain a grin when asked if it 
had been a busy day. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no central information booth, so people are stopping anyone with a 
name tag," said Lora Wright, a waitress at the Orange Grill, a neon-decorated 
sit-down bar and restaurant centrally located on terminal's upper tier. 
</P>
<P>
The two most asked questions, say airport employees: Where is the statue of 
John Wayne? And where is such-and-such a flight arriving? 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, that is just gorgeous," gushed Pat Cottingham of Irvine, one of a steady 
stream of people clustered around the newly colorized bronze statue of John 
Wayne in the new terminal's central foyer. 
</P>
<P>
She usually just drops husband Grant off at the curb for his weekly business 
trips. But since Sunday was opening day for the spanking-new terminal, both 
wanted a little tour around first. Top of their "must-see" list was "The Duke." 
</P>
<P>
"We'd seen it before when it was outside, but we wanted to see what it would 
look like in here," explained Grant Cottingham, western regional vice president 
for Best Products Co. who was on his way to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Waller had the other question on her lips. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this place, but I see a flaw in their screens," said the elementary 
school teacher from Laguna Hills as she went from one video display screen to 
another, and finally to a white courtesy telephone to find out where to meet 
her daughter's flight from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of hundreds stymied by the lack of arrival gate information, a 
not-so-subtle message apparently aimed at discouraging people from meeting 
passengers at the gates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a guessing game," said Waller. "It doesn't make sense that they wouldn't 
tell you what gate to meet passengers. You'd think they would want to show this 
place off!" 
</P>
<P>
Even airport employees faced some glitches. 
</P>
<P>
Zenaida Torres, American Airlines' head baggage agent, arrived plenty early 
Sunday. It was a good thing, she said. She and a host of other employees 
discovered that their card keys didn't work. It seems their code numbers had 
been voided in the security system somehow, she said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10 travelers complained about the dearth of mail boxes. Airport 
employees said the two mail drops were tough to find, but that they'd have to 
wait a day for a solution. It seems moving a mail box without authorization is 
a federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the clock dominating the northern end of the terminal. Though 
there were no numerals on its face, it was fairly easy to make out the time as 
10:07. Trouble was, it had been 10:07 all day. 
</P>
<P>
One thing was consistent, though. Employees, however harried, seemed dedicated 
to retaining that solicitous hometown feel that had characterized the cramped 
1960s-era terminal. 
</P>
<P>
As one visitor took a big bite of a broccoli and cheese croissant, a stranger 
inquired about the taste. 
</P>
<P>
"Excellent," was the muffled reply as she tried not to splatter him with 
crumbs. "Is it hot enough?" he asked. When she nodded, he said: "I'm with the 
restaurant. Just checking on your meal. Enjoy." 
</P>

notebook.

BEN FRANK, 56; TV, FILM AND STAGE ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Frank, a veteran character actor who recently starred in California's 
controversial anti-smoking commercial, has died from a heart attack. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
Frank died Tuesday in Los Angeles, his wife, producer Bobbi Frank, announced 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, who characterized himself as part of "the long gray line" of character 
actors whose faces but not names are well-known, recently told The Times that 
he was proud of his nameless starring role in the television spot produced by 
the California Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time in my life I felt like I was doing something good," he 
said of his part as a tobacco-industry executive who encourages his underlings 
to enlist more smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the commercial portrayed tobacco leaders as evil, some television 
stations refused to run it. The spot, which attracted national attention as the 
first government effort of its kind to curb smoking, concluded with Frank's 
ominous laugh as he admonishes his colleagues: "We're not in this business for 
our health!" 
</P>
<P>
Although Frank never achieved top billing, he had a successful career from his 
early childhood. Born in New York City, he sang on stage from age 6 through 12. 
Later, he boxed professionally, winning 20 bouts and losing only twice. 
</P>
<P>
His 28-year acting career included 125 television roles, 20 motion pictures and 
20 stage plays. Frank also estimated that one-third of his income was from work 
in commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that an actor's real job is looking for a job," Frank jokingly told 
The Times. "When you have a job, you're on vacation, so enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe," he added, commenting on the constant auditioning an actor must do, 
"when you die and go to heaven, St. Peter's going to ask you to read." 
</P>
<P>
In television, Frank guest-starred on popular series such as "L.A. Law," 
"Growing Pains," "Cagney &amp; Lacey" and "Who's the Boss?" 
</P>
<P>
His film roles included "Thelma and Louise," "Hollywood Vice Squad," "Death 
Wish II" and "Don't Answer the Phone." His stage credits included "Three Men on 
a Horse," "King of the Schnorrers" and "Decisions, Decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Frank had recently made his directing debut with a comedy series of one-act 
plays, "Zeitgeist," at Studio Barbara Feldman in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, Frank is survived by his daughter, Modi Frank, his 
mother, two sisters, two stepchildren and one step-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services will be conducted at 7 p.m. Wednesday, at the Hollywood 
Roosevelt.

TEACHER PAY IN HUENEME IS AT HEAD OF CLASS; 
</P>
<P>
WAGES: MOST NEW INSTRUCTORS IN THE ELEMENTARY DISTRICT ARE STARTING AT $26,700, 
WHICH CAN NEARLY DOUBLE IN 12 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sharon Schiro, the daughter of two schoolteachers, has always known that she 
wanted to follow in her parents' path with a career in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
This month, Schiro, 24, began her first year as a full-time teacher, 
instructing fourth- and fifth-grade students at Fred Williams Elementary School 
in the Hueneme Elementary School District. 
</P>
<P>
Schiro's beginning salary is $26,700 a year, not exactly a king's ransom. But 
one of the factors that led her to apply in the Hueneme district, she said, was 
the potential for eventually earning nearly twice that amount -- and several 
thousand dollars more than in other Ventura County districts -- if she remains 
with Hueneme for at least 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The higher salaries are a symptom of the whole district," said Schiro, who was 
a substitute teacher in Hueneme and other nearby districts. Schiro's mother is 
a reading specialist at Williams, and her father teaches social science at 
Hueneme High School. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hueneme district officials, Schiro is not alone in preferring a 
job with the Hueneme district. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the past 15 years, the 7,300-student district has been the 
highest-paying elementary school district in Ventura County. School officials 
said the greater earning potential in Hueneme has made it easier to recruit 
good teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very attractive to teachers, particularly to new teachers coming in," 
said Jeffrey L. Baarstad, administrative assistant for management and business 
services. "They look at the salary schedule and see how much they would be 
making five years down the road." 
</P>
<P>
With a 3.7% raise this school year, the starting salary in the Hueneme district 
is $25,400 a year for teachers with a college degree but without teaching 
credentials, Baarstad said. But most new teachers have both a degree and a 
credential and start at $26,700, Baarstad said. 
</P>
<P>
The average minimum starting salary for the county's other elementary districts 
is just over $22,000, according to figures compiled by the county's 
superintendent of schools office in May. Some of those districts have since 
implemented cost-of-living raises averaging about 3%. 
</P>
<P>
School officials cautioned that it is difficult to compare salary schedules 
among districts because the complex systems for computing pay are based on 
education and experience and vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials in other districts acknowledged that Hueneme's salaries have 
been at or near the top among the county's districts for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost two to three teachers a year to Hueneme," said Kent Patterson, 
assistant superintendent of the Oxnard elementary district. "They go because of 
the salary, they've told me. It's hard to turn down when it's $1,500 to $2,000 
a year more." 
</P>
<P>
However, Patterson said a recent 6.5% pay increase may help the Oxnard district 
retain more teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts said teachers are not leaving to go to Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not losing teachers to Hueneme that I'm aware of," said Leean Nemeroff, 
assistant superintendent of the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Ventura County school officials said there is a surplus of 
credentialed teachers, although teachers with special ties in mathematics, 
science or special education or with bilingual credentials are still in short 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
For teachers in the Hueneme district, the difference comes at the higher end of 
the pay scale: Teachers with a master's degree and 12 years of experience make 
$49,500, Baarstad said. 
</P>
<P>
The next closest district in the county is the Oxnard Union High School 
District, where teachers at the high end of the salary range make $47,561. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard and Hueneme, as in most other districts, teachers with at least 15 
years of continuous experience with the district also receive annual bonuses of 
$300 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Growth in other industries sometimes benefits the school districts. Some 
couples who move to the county include a spouse with a teaching credential, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Chadwell is one. 
</P>
<P>
"The high salary is why I settled on Hueneme," said Chadwell, who taught for a 
year in the Pomona Unified School District before her husband transferred to 
Ventura County because of his job. She began her first year at Hueneme's 
Parkview Elementary School this month. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwell, who also has a bilingual credential, earns $27,900 a year, about 
$5,000 less than she made in Pomona, she said. But Chadwell said the salary is 
more than was offered in Oxnard Elementary, Ventura Unified, Pleasant Valley 
Unified and Rio school districts. The offers were from $700 to nearly $3,000 
less than she was offered by Hueneme, she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of reasons for Hueneme's higher salaries, Baarstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is the amount of money the Hueneme district has received from the 
federal government over the past 15 years because the Naval Construction 
Battalion Center is in the district's jurisdiction, Baarstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Such federal impact aid is given to all school districts where there are 
military bases, federal prisons or other government property, and is intended 
to make up for property taxes that the districts would ordinarily receive from 
residential and other property. 
</P>
<P>
When the district started receiving impact aid 15 years ago, it amounted to 
about $1 million annually, much of which was used for teachers' salaries, 
Baarstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the impact aid has dwindled to less than $400,000 of the district's 
$27-million budget, but the district is still committed to the salary schedule, 
Baarstad said. 
</P>
<P>
But Baarstad said higher salaries have a price. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs us more in real dollars to give a 1% raise than if our salary 
schedule peaked at $5,000 to $10,000 lower," Baarstad said. The district pays 
about $130,000 for each 1% in salary increases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the historically higher salaries, both Hueneme teachers and 
district administrators said, is a strong teachers union, the Hueneme Education 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a lot to do with the attitude of the district and the school board," 
said Donna Branstrom, president of the 300-member association. "They really 
realize that the teacher is the core of the instruction, and that's where they 
want to put their money." 
</P>
<P>
But some teachers said that although the district pays teachers more on 
average, it is difficult for experienced teachers to get a job in the Hueneme 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"It's well-known that unless you have a bilingual credential it's hard to get 
hired in the district if you have more than five years of experience," said a 
teacher who has taught in the district for 17 years and who asked not to be 
named. She said she believed several highly experienced teachers seeking jobs 
in Hueneme have been turned down because it is more expensive to pay them than 
teachers with less experience. 
</P>
<P>
However, Baarstad said the district's only criterion is hiring the 
best-qualified person. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at candidates based on credentials, experience and the needs of the 
district," Baarstad said. "We try to get the best person for the job."

1ST-TIME DRUG OFFENDERS RARELY GET JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
LAW AND ORDER: OFFICIALS SAY PENALTIES SHOULD BE STIFFENED BUT THEY STOP SHORT 
OF ENDORSING L.A. POLICE CHIEF DARYL GATES' STATEMENT THAT CASUAL USERS SHOULD 
BE SHOT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Casual drug users -- the people Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates says 
should be shot -- rarely receive jail sentences on their first offense in 
Ventura County despite the county's tough law and order image. 
</P>
<P>
Possession of a gram of cocaine on first offense, a felony that carries a 
possible one-year jail term, probably will land the casual drug user in the 
county probation department's diversion program, prosecutors said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The rules there: Obey all laws for two years, attend drug education classes and 
pass about two urine tests during that time. If all conditions are met, the 
charge is purged from the user's record. 
</P>
<P>
According to law enforcement officials, first-time felony possession 
convictions for heroin, PCP, LSD or methamphetamines also usually go to 
diversion instead of jail. If the offenders behave, their slates are wiped 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
And in Ventura County, as throughout California, possession of less than an 
ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor that costs little more than most speeding 
tickets; it carries a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Was Gates right to suggest shooting casual drug users? 
</P>
<P>
"It was, at first blush . . . an irresponsible statement," said Sheriff John V. 
Gillespie, whose own preference is to jail them instead in a proposed "tent 
city" that he would like to see built on the Seabee base at Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
But while Gillespie excused Gates as trying to shock lawmakers into focusing on 
America's drug addiction, he also advocated the firing squad for smugglers, 
"who bring in tons and tons of cocaine and . . . see that it gets peddled on 
junior high school campuses, and the people behind the assassination of more 
than 200 judges in Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Police Chief Richard Thomas said: "Casual drug users are in large part 
responsible for the predicament that this country's in with drugs today. And I 
think that they ought to be dealt with as severely as we can deal with them, 
but I would stop short of shooting them." The answer, Thomas said, is "severe 
jail sentences." 
</P>
<P>
And Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said, "I don't really 
believe that he as an individual or as a police chief would advocate the 
execution of anybody for casual drug use." 
</P>
<P>
But the casual drug user's money is feeding the traffickers, and that must be 
stopped, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
While Ventura County law enforcement officials drew the line this week at 
endorsing Gates' firing squad solution, many said jail is more appropriate for 
casual drug users than the second chance they now receive on first offenses. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the current diversion program has about a 45% failure rate -- measured 
by dropouts and continued drug use -- and is widely referred to as a joke by 
law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Officials find the program so unsuccessful that the Municipal Court and the 
offices of the public defender and district attorney are working to help the 
county Corrections Services Agency, the official name of the probation 
department, to revise it. 
</P>
<P>
In a June 29 letter, Presiding Municipal Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr. wrote the 
department: 
</P>
<P>
"A program that does not do anything particularly worthwhile is a waste of 
money. For courts to place people into such a program is a fraud on them and 
the public we serve. . . . If we do not see a substantial improvement in the 
program immediately, we will seek an alternative provider for a program of 
substance." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to diversion program Director Calvin Remington, is that 
the courts are feeding mostly hard-core cocaine addicts into a program that was 
designed 15 years ago for casual users of drugs ranging from marijuana to 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they don't report in, they move, they leave the area," Remington 
said Friday. "I have to assume, if they're leading a nice, productive life, 
they would tend to report in and take care of business, so I think the 45% that 
fail are continuing to use drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Jean L. Farley said recent budget cuts have forced the 
probation department to focus its dwindling resources on hard-core addicts, 
which means less attention is paid to casual drug users -- who she said fall 
off diversion more frequently as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Remington said about 70 to 75 people per month go into the diversion program. 
The majority of people sent into diversion last year -- 625 or 85% -- were 
arrested for drug intoxication, while the remaining 110 or 15% were arrested 
for simple possession charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And about 2,160 people were arraigned on possession charges alone, court 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 900 to 1,000 drug users now in diversion, 80% were arrested for cocaine 
charges, 10% for amphetamines, 5% for heroin and 5% for marijuana, Remington 
said. Seventy-five percent are employed. Eighty percent are males earning an 
average of $18,000 a year, while 20% are females earning an average of $9,000 a 
year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Remington said probation officials hope to get a revised diversion program in 
place within 60 days. They also hope it will reduce the number of people who 
"fall off" diversion and are rearrested on drug charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan would have two levels: the first for casual drug users who are not 
found to be addicted and the second for more hard-core addicts, Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
The first level would replace the current minimum 5 1/2-hour drug education 
program with a minimum 26 1/2 hours of counseling and education, and would 
subject participants to drug tests at least once a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the person tests dirty, they may be prosecuted, or they may get a chance 
from the court to go to Level 2," Remington said. "Level 2 hasn't been designed 
yet, but it's going to be a very lengthy program, somewhere between nine and 12 
months" of education, counseling and treatment, plus frequent and random drug 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
The increased attention for drug users could be subsidized by fees levied 
against people who opt for diversion instead of jail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the probation department is working with the RAND Corp. of Santa Monica 
to experiment with more accurate drug tests which could make it more difficult 
for someone's drug use to escape detection, Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine shows up in tests for only seven to 10 days after it is used, and the 
user often has some advance warning of when he or she will be tested, Remington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But while Remington says the people on diversion get "a very good deal from the 
system" if they follow the rules, prosecutors say casual drug users will be hit 
hard if they "fall off" diversion and are rearrested. 
</P>
<P>
Diversion participants who "fall off" are prosecuted for the original charge 
and any additional charges for which they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Second offenses for possessing carry a maximum penalty of up to three years in 
jail, and convicts in Ventura County often serve a sentence of 60 to 120 days, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward F. Brodie. 
</P>
<P>
And reoffending on intoxication charges will land the casual user in jail for a 
mandatory minimum of 90 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald C. Janes said he supports diversion for first-time 
offenders so they can get treatment. But he added, "The second time, we should 
come down on them like a ton of bricks." 
</P>
<P>
However, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said, "Diversion is the worst thing 
that's happened to the war on drugs." Diversion "basically immunizes" 
first-time offenders for whom their arrest "is clearly not the first time" they 
have used drugs, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury and Gillespie have drafted an extensive -- and expensive -- plan for 
dealing with casual drug users. If the U.S. Department of Justice and federal 
drug czar William Bennett approve the $7-million proposal, the county would get 
federal aid to increase drug treatment and education, hire more prosecutors, 
boost staff in the sheriff's crime lab to test more urine and blood samples, 
and build a tent jail to house so-called "recreational users" who are 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
But while all the police chiefs of Ventura County have signed off on the drug 
plan and support jail time for second offenders, they have varied ideas on how 
to treat first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens proposes stiff fines and formal probation for 
first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Chief Thomas advocates mandatory jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
And Santa Paula Police Chief Robert Adair supports Bradbury's and Gillespie's 
drug strategy, adding: "If I had my druthers, the programs would be adequately 
funded, and there would be sufficient rehabilitation programs out there. But 
unfortunately there are not." 
</P>
<P>
But some officials have questioned the soundness of the plan provisions that 
would increase prosecution and punishment for casual drug users. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman conceded that "casual cocaine use is very 
serious. . . . But I do not feel that taking those casual users and pumping 
them into an overcrowded court system and making criminals out of them is going 
to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he endorses the plan to improve the diversion program and favors 
putting drug users who fall off of it into the county's work-furlough program 
so they could sleep in barracks at night and work at their regular jobs by day. 
</P>
<P>
Farley said of the tent jail plan, "Studies have shown that, if you put 
somebody in jail who is a first-time drug user and you sentence them to six 
months in hard labor, when they come out, they're not going to have anything 
different than they had when they went in. . . . They're going to be introduced 
back into the same social situation they have been in before." 
</P>
<P>
And Judge Cooper said, "I don't have a lot of problem with that tent idea, but 
what they were trying to do is to get to the casual drug user. And I put to 
them, 'If you're not getting to them now, how are you going to get to them with 
this program in place?' "

<P>
VENTURA: ABOUT 60,000 VEHICLES PASS DAILY THROUGH VALENTINE ROAD AT VICTORIA 
AVENUE, THE CITY'S MOST TROUBLESOME TRAFFIC SPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Jim Salzer opened his record store near the intersection of Valentine Road 
and Victoria Avenue in Ventura in 1972, there wasn't much traffic -- or 
anything else -- in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very quiet and sedate," he said. "There was very little going on here. 
People criticized me for building my store in the middle of nowhere. In five 
years, all of that changed." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Salzer lost his curbside parking when Valentine Road was widened to 
include a left-turn lane. The same year, the Ventura County Government Center 
opened a few blocks down, on Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Those changes, coupled with rapid growth in the area, are blamed for creating 
what is now the busiest and most troublesome intersection in the city and 
possibly all of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the worst as far as intersections," said Nazir Lalani, Ventura's 
transportation and traffic engineer. "That is definitely it." 
</P>
<P>
Lalani said an average of 60,000 vehicles pass through the intersection daily. 
The figure does not include vehicles exiting from the Ventura Freeway onto 
Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
He said his office receives about 600 traffic-related complaints a year, and 
about a fourth of them involve the Valentine Road-Victoria Avenue intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Police Department is the source of many of those complaints. Police 
said they frequently have to send officers to direct traffic at the 
intersection because its traffic signals break down. 
</P>
<P>
Lalani said the highly complex, computerized traffic signal has broken down at 
least once a month since January. A recent power outage left the traffic 
signals out of sync for two days, even though power in the area was restored 
within five minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lalani said he wrote a letter to Caltrans, which is responsible for operating 
the signals, suggesting that it either "do a better job" or let the city 
monitor the lights. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Ciriaco, a Caltrans electrical engineer, said one reason the lights keep 
breaking down is because of power outages, which foul up the traffic light's 
programming system. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a power outage about every three weeks," Ciriaco said. "We really 
don't know what's going on with Edison." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Olson, an area manager for Southern California Edison, said the city has 
had four power outages near the intersection since January. Two were caused by 
cars running into utility poles elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the last outage, Ciriaco said, Caltrans has installed wiring that will 
keep the traffic lights working during a power failure. 
</P>
<P>
Salzer said the city should find a way to reduce the volume of traffic that 
passes through the intersection every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen this finger-pointing exercise before," Salzer said. "The city is 
extremely slow to act, and no one seems to hold them accountable. They should 
have been looking at this 10 years ago. We've basically seen our business 
strangled by traffic, and the city does nothing about it." 
</P>
<P>
Salzer said most of the traffic is the result of overdevelopment in the city's 
industrial and business park area, located on and southwest of Valentine Road. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Millais, Ventura's community development director, sees things a little 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rapid growth in the district during the late 1970s and through the 
1980s, Millais said it was not until 1988 that the city began collecting fees 
from developers to help solve traffic problems created by their projects. 
</P>
<P>
The system worked well until March, when the City Council passed a water 
conservation ordinance that has temporarily eliminated new development in the 
city. The result is that the city is left without some revenue for traffic 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said about 10,000 people work in the district, and many of them 
use the Victoria Avenue and Valentine Road intersection to get to work every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more people employed there than in any other part of the city," said 
Mark Stephens, senior planner for the city. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the massive amount of growth that has occurred in the city south 
of the Ventura Freeway, Millais said the Ventura County Government Center is 
responsible for funneling a large amount of traffic through the Victoria Avenue 
and Valentine Road intersection. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,400 county employees work at the center, located at the corner of 
Victoria Avenue and Telegraph Road. The center, which attracts hundreds of 
visitors throughout the county daily, moved from what is now Ventura City Hall 
to its present site in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to point the finger, you could blame the County Government Center 
for a lot of the traffic," Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
Millais said that before much new development is allowed along Victoria Avenue 
and Valentine Road, the city probably will require that funding for traffic 
improvements be in place. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lalani, however, that could be another 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
He said funds that the city will receive from Proposition 111 have already been 
earmarked for other projects that have been delayed over the years because of a 
lack of funding. Proposition 111, which was passed by voters in June, raised 
the gasoline and diesel tax to help finance traffic improvements statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The additional tax money is expected to generate an estimated $18.5 billion 
statewide for transportation projects over the next 10 years, with Ventura 
County receiving about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lalani said work on realigning Valentine Road and reconfiguring the on-ramps 
and off-ramps of the Ventura Freeway could begin sooner -- in four to five 
years -- if county voters approve a ballot measure in November that is 
basically a companion piece to Proposition 111. 
</P>
<P>
State and county transportation officials said about $2 billion of Proposition 
111 funds will be distributed to those counties that can come up with matching 
funds. They said if voters approve the half-cent sales tax increase, the county 
could receive another $130 million over the next 10 years.

Belmont Park's New Night Life Raises Philanthropist's Memory 
</P>
<P>
Hello. 
</P>
<P>
 May I speak to John D. Spreckels, please? Yes, of course I know he died in 
1926 at age 73. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I think he deserves to know what's become of those 17 seaside acres in 
Mission Beach where he built such a nifty amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
After all, his family willed the site to the city in the late 1930s to be kept 
for the general good. 
</P>
<P>
John, you old sugar-newspaper-land-railroad baron, is that you? 
</P>
<P>
I was out at the new Belmont Park on Saturday. The place was hopping late into 
the night. That hasn't happened in nearly a generation. 
</P>
<P>
The city may have bumbled into something fun. 
</P>
<P>
A place where teens and young adults can buy a slice of pizza or a chocolate 
cookie, maybe dance at the Club Red Onion, maybe ride the renovated roller 
coaster. 
</P>
<P>
Is it the highest and best use for the site? Who knows? That's yesterday's 
question. It's here now, let's enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
It's not Disneyland, John. There is a certain gaminess. 
</P>
<P>
A college student from Clairemont named Jim Wegeforth told me, "It's a hangout 
place, man. The malls don't want us." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd is eclectic: fully integrated, football lettermen, upscale teen-agers 
from Tijuana, arm-in-arm couples, sailors in mid-boot camp, guys on unicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the beach can be weird, John. A fellow came roller-skating through 
wearing only a lavender G-string. 
</P>
<P>
A radio station was having a dog contest. A golden retriever won the best 
costume category. I asked if he always dresses like this. 
</P>
<P>
"Only for formal occasions," a guy named Wayne Borin told me. His nephew, Tommy 
Taylor, who is 9 and lives in Oceanside, owns the dog. 
</P>
<P>
Owner and dog drifted away. Nobody noticed a dog wearing a pink tutu. 
</P>
<P>
It's that kind of crowd these days (and nights) at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
You might like it, John. Then again, you've been gone a long time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blowing in the Wind 
</P>
<P>
There's meaning here somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
* North County bumper sticker: Isn't it time to pull over and check the air in 
your head? 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego attorney David Mulliken will represent San Diego City Councilman 
Bruce Henderson in his 11th-hour fight against the billion-dollar sewer plan. 
Pro bono. 
</P>
<P>
Mulliken last year forced the council to reverse its denial of a proposed 
hazardous-waste incinerator for La Jolla and won a $1.25-million judgment from 
the city. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Picketing, Politicking, Pontificating

<P>

$5.3 MILLION WON BY WOMAN IN GM FAULTY BRAKE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury last week awarded $5.3 million to an Encino teacher who was severely 
injured in a traffic accident when a pickup truck's brakes failed, and the 
teacher's attorney contends that there are dangerous design flaws in thousands 
of the trucks still on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills attorney A. Tod Hindin urged a recall of an estimated 200,000 
1977 General Motors heavy- and medium-duty trucks with single hydraulic brake 
systems, calling them "time bombs waiting to go off." 
</P>
<P>
GM officials said they have no intention of recalling the trucks, which they 
say are perfectly safe. 
</P>
<P>
Hindin's client, Lois Gass, suffered a broken neck, a ruptured spinal disc and 
an eye injury when the car in which she was riding was rear-ended by a 1977 
Chevrolet C-65 truck July 31, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, Ron Wood, an employee of a Chatsworth T-shirt 
distributor, Clothes for Heroes, testified during the trial that he was 
traveling about 55 m.p.h. when the brakes on the 12,000-pound truck suddenly 
failed at the top of the Sepulveda pass on the northbound San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
As Wood pumped the brakes and furiously honked the horn, the truck, going about 
70 m.p.h., slammed into a Honda Prelude carrying Gass and two other teachers, 
then smashed into another car and pickup truck before coming to rest on the 
center divider. 
</P>
<P>
Wood was not hurt but Gass and five other people suffered injuries ranging from 
minor to serious. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the California Highway Patrol showed that a hole developed 
in the truck's brake line allowing brake fluid to escape. This essentially left 
the truck without brakes, court documents indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Gass, 46, and her husband, Mervyn, filed a product liability lawsuit in Van 
Nuys Superior Court contending that the GM truck was defectively designed 
because it contained a single, rather than a dual, hydraulic brake system and 
that the brake line burst because it was too close to an exhaust manifold. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as defendants were the T-shirt company, which allegedly failed to 
properly maintain the truck; Gene Berg GMC of Van Nuys, which sold the truck, 
and Murray's Truck Service of Chatsworth, which the Gasses contended 
negligently failed to inspect the brake lines while servicing the truck 45 days 
before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
GM's attorney, Eugene R. Grace, argued that the single brake system is safe and 
that a dual brake system was not required by federal law until six years after 
the manufacture of the truck involved in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
GM blamed the accident on Wood's driving and poor maintenance of the truck, 
which had formerly been owned by a truck rental outlet. The auto maker also 
contended that Gass is not disabled and could return to work. 
</P>
<P>
After a six-week trial before Judge Thomas Schnider, the jury absolved Gene 
Berg GMC of any blame in the accident but ordered GM and Murray's Truck Service 
to pay $5.3 million to Lois Gass and $350,000 to her husband. The jury said GM 
should pay 85% of the judgment, with the truck service paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance company for the T-shirt manufacturer earlier paid the Gasses 
$750,000 in an out-of-court settlement but since the jury did not find the 
T-shirt company at fault, GM and Murray's will be required to reimburse the 
money, Hindin said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury did not award the Gasses punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the other five people injured in the accident also filed suits but 
settled out of court for about $600,000 from GM, the truck company and the 
T-shirt manufacturer, said Hindin. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokesman Sharon Hines said the company may appeal the verdict, which she 
called "wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the truck was properly designed and we have no intention of 
recalling trucks similar to the one involved in this case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dual hydraulic brake systems -- which provide a backup brake system in case the 
primary brakes fail -- have been required by the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration on passenger cars since the 1967 model year but were not 
required on medium- and heavy-duty trucks until the 1983 model year, said Tim 
Hurd, the highway administration's chief of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Auto 
Safety, founded in 1970 by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, agreed with Hindin 
that the single system is defective, adding: "A system that is as vital to the 
operational safety of the vehicle as the brakes should have a backup." 
</P>
<P>
Hurd said the highway administration cannot order an auto maker to 
retroactively install safety features that were not required when a vehicle was 
manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
The agency keeps no statistics on the number of single-brake system trucks 
involved in accidents, Hurd said. But he noted that the agency has seen "no 
indication of a safety defect trend with these trucks." Even if a defect were 
to be found, the statute of limitations on recalls is eight years, Hurd said.

5 GOP INCUMBENTS ARE VIRTUAL SHOO-INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, with a pair of vacant congressional seats up for grabs, Orange 
County's political stage featured a host of candidates battling it out for the 
rarely available, highly secure federal offices. 
</P>
<P>
This year's county congressional races haven't provided voters with the same 
kind of spectacle. There are no open seats, and all five of the county's 
congressmen are heavy favorites to win. 
</P>
<P>
In two of the races, the incumbents face no active major party opposition at 
all. No Democrats surfaced to challenge 43rd District Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad), who represents southernmost Orange County and northern San Diego 
County; his only opponents are Libertarian Richard L. Arnold, a retired Army 
officer, and Peace and Freedom Party member Doug Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, 38th District Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) confronts a 
Democratic opponent who dropped out of the race before the primary election -- 
too late for her name to be pulled from the ballot -- but won anyway. Planned 
Parenthood spokeswoman Barbara Jackson said last spring that she withdrew to 
protect her nonprofit employer, and last week she reiterated that "nothing has 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
In the county's other three congressional races, the incumbents at least face 
spirited, though under-funded, opponents of decidedly different political 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Francis X. Hoffman, the Democratic candidate in the 39th District, said he is 
running against Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) to give voters a 
choice and to raise certain issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any illusions about a landslide in November," said Hoffman, a 
Garden Grove attorney and Democratic Party activist. "But I'd like to see him 
(Dannemeyer) answer for the votes he's taken. . . . Two years ago, he wasn't 
opposed (by a Democrat) and he wasn't made to answer for anything." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Hoffman takes exception to Dannemeyer's persistent attacks on 
homosexuals, especially the congressman's reading into the Congressional Record 
explicit descriptions of homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
"If my kid came across this, I'd punch Mr. Dannemeyer right in the nose," 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer called Hoffman's position "ridiculous" and said he read the 
descriptions into the Congressional Record so that the public would know 
exactly what homosexuals do. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more bizarre tactics Hoffman has employed in his campaign was taking 
and releasing the results of an AIDS test and a lie-detector test, in which he 
was asked if he had ever engaged in sex with another man or if he had ever been 
unfaithful to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The answers were all negative, and Hoffman wants Dannemeyer to submit to a 
similar test. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't normally consider doing something like that, but he seems so severe 
in his criticism," Hoffman said. "Leadership should be by example." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer, when asked if he would consider Hoffman's challenge, said his blood 
was determined to be free of the HIV virus three years ago when he donated 
blood. As for taking a lie-detector test to prove his heterosexuality and 
faithfulness to his wife, Dannemeyer said Hoffman "has the whole concept of due 
process turned upside down. I'm presumed innocent until someone proves me 
guilty or even suggests that I'm guilty of something." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer and his wife celebrated their 35th anniversary last month, the 
congressman pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer said he intends to focus his campaign on such issues as the need for 
a balanced budget amendment, reduced government spending and a more secure 
southern border 
</P>
<P>
A third candidate, Peace and Freedom Party stalwart Maxine B. Quirk, is also in 
the race and brings with her a call for action. A 68-year-old apartment owner 
who lives in Orange, Quirk said the electorate should sweep out the entire 
Congress, along with Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to get out all the incumbents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 40th District, freshman Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) is also 
facing a candidate who says he is running primarily to keep the Democratic 
Party name and philosophy afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody had to do it," said Laguna Beach attorney and Democratic Party 
activist Eugene C. Gratz. "Particularly in the 40th District, somebody had to 
be willing to do it to focus voters on the issue of choice." 
</P>
<P>
Cox -- whom Gratz describes as "bright" and "an effective legislator" -- 
supports abortion rights but opposes government funding for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
But Gratz, an issues-oriented candidate who taught English and theology before 
getting his law degree, says the distinction is irrelevant. "You can't 
seriously say that you're not anti-choice if you're anti-funding," Gratz said. 
"The deprivation of funds is tantamount to the deprivation of the procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, whose main domestic issues are budget reform and fiscal responsibility, 
called Gratz's argument "fallacious." 
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers need not subsidize yet another new spending program," Cox said. "The 
notion that the government must subsidize something because it is someone's 
personal choice is not logically compelled." 
</P>
<P>
In the coastal 40th District, occupied by freshman Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Long Beach), Democrat Guy C. Kimbrough is not quite ready to lump himself 
with candidates running solely to make a point or keep the party name on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go into this race as some sort of Pollyanna to raise some issues," 
said Kimbrough, a political science instructor at Mt. San Jacinto College. "I 
entered to win." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough hopes to raise money from arts supporters nationwide who may be 
angered by Rohrabacher's much-publicized opposition to the National Endowment 
for the Arts. He said that he will also focus on the issue of a woman's right 
to an abortion, which Kimbrough supports and Rohrabacher opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, however, said Kimbrough is on the wrong side of both issues. "If 
he leans toward using tax dollars to subsidize pornography and sacrilegious art 
in order to get money out of the Hollywood left, I think he's making a 
mistake," Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said he will not focus his campaign on the NEA, but rather on 
his support of the aerospace industry and his views on tax and spending issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of things I want to try to cut out of the budget," 
Rohrabacher said.

SOME RENTERS NOT AT HOME WITH COMPLEX CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: RENOVATIONS AND RENT INCREASES AT 548-UNIT LOMA PALISADES APARTMENT 
COMPLEX ARE DISPLACING MANY LONGTIME TENANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty-year-old Leonard Henneveld admits that when millionaire Ernest Rady and 
his partners first bought the Loma Palisades apartments in July, he paid little 
attention. After 17 years in the sprawling Point Loma complex, the retired 
accountant figured it would take more than a new landlord to upset his life. 
</P>
<P>
Then the rent went up 10% -- from $600 to $660 for a two-bedroom unit and up to 
$680 for a three-bedroom. As part of a landscaping plan, Rady's management 
company, American Assets Inc., poisoned the grass, turning it brown. Seventy of 
Henneveld's neighbors were told they would have to move out to make way for 
renovations. 
</P>
<P>
And then, to Henneveld's amazement, a crew ripped the roof off the second-story 
unit he and his ailing wife share, showering their possessions with gravel and 
dirt. Henneveld made "a scene" in the management office and was recompensed 
eight days' rent for the roofing fallout. But still, he has decided to move 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"First, I decided, 'I won't pay a dime (in rent).' But I won't make a scene 
about it anymore. I have to think of my own heart," he said, explaining that he 
plans to move by the end of this month. "The new owners don't care. It's an 
investment object, not a home." 
</P>
<P>
Henneveld is not alone. On recent weekends, the 30-year-old property -- what 
some called Point Loma's last truly affordable housing -- has been dotted with 
moving vans and yard sales. Local liquor stores have noted a run on cardboard 
packing boxes, and Barnard Elementary School, many of whose students live in 
the 548-unit complex, has seen a decline in enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our families who have been with us for some time have indicated that 
they can't afford the rent hike and they won't be able to continue," said 
Principal Pat McGann, who says the school has fewer kindergartners and 
first-graders this year than in the past. "We are monitoring it very 
carefully." 
</P>
<P>
A few residents even believe that the rent hike, which took effect Sept. 1, 
played a part in the Aug. 28 suicide of Lester Finkelstein, a 62-year-old 
grandfather and seven-year resident who drowned himself in one of the Loma 
Palisades pools. While he left no note, his roommate, Scott Rohter, says he is 
convinced that fear of homelessness made him do it. 
</P>
<P>
"My roommate was down to his last few bucks," said Rohter, who is leading a 
one-man rent strike, hanging a banner off his balcony that reads, "Rent Strike, 
Not Rent Hike." "He didn't want to be homeless and he was ashamed of having to 
borrow money from his family." 
</P>
<P>
Rady, a minority owner of the Padres, a director of Western Financial Savings 
Bank and chairman of the Insurance Company of the West, did not return 
telephone calls last week. But officials at American Assets, which manages 
2,100 apartments countywide, firmly rejected the suggestion that they are 
ushering in an era of heartlessness at Loma Palisades. The repairs they are 
making are essential, they say, and even after the increase, rents remain lower 
than other apartments in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Change is difficult. And certainly some people that currently live there 
(will) not be able to continue to live there," said Allen Garrett, an American 
Assets vice president who himself lived in Loma Palisades 23 years ago, when it 
was what he called still a "lovely, first-class garden-style apartment 
complex." 
</P>
<P>
"But due to the previous management's lack of care for the property, it has 
turned into an eyesore -- and could turn into a ghetto if something wasn't done 
about it," he said. "It is within a number of years or months before minor 
problems start turning into very major problems." 
</P>
<P>
"We assure you, it is all going to be worthwhile," Mike Austin, the complex's 
new resident manager, wrote to Henneveld and his neighbors last week in a memo 
commanding that they close the windows and doors in their non-air-conditioned 
apartments so workmen could water-blast the exterior paint. "Loma Palisades is 
going to be (once again) the place to live." 
</P>
<P>
But several tenants -- among them single mothers, retirees and military 
personnel -- lament that as Loma Palisades becomes the place to live, they will 
no longer be the tenants who live there. Most acknowledge that the dingy 
apartments could use improvement. But new roofs, remodeled kitchens, spiffier 
lawns and fresh paint will mean little, they say, to those who cannot afford to 
stay and enjoy them. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalie Gilliland, a bartender and single mother of four, contends that is part 
of the new management's plan -- to clear out the current tenants to make way 
for upper-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
"They're blaming the condition of the building on the tenants -- and equating 
tenants who make more money with a better quality of tenant," she said, adding 
that since she was told to expect her 30-day "notice to vacate" just before 
Christmas, she, too, has been looking for new lodgings. "It's becoming more and 
more clear: We're not wanted here, folks. They're doing everything to drive us 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett denies this, saying that American Assets is doing "everything possible" 
to accommodate those people who already call Loma Palisades home. He admits, 
however, that the rents will likely go up again before the renovation process 
is over. Eventually, Garrett said, the company plans to charge $710 and up for 
a two-bedroom and $830 or more for a three-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the intent of such a hike, Gilliland says, the result will be the 
same: She will be priced out of Loma Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the rent went up, Gilliland was skimping to make ends meet. In 
July, she put a deposit on a two-bedroom unit and told management she wanted to 
switch to a three-bedroom when one opened up. Anticipating how crowded things 
would be, she sent her youngest child to live with her sister -- just until she 
could save a little to move into the bigger unit. 
</P>
<P>
But when she picked up her keys on Aug. 1, she learned that new owners were 
raising the rents and that she would soon be asked to move out. With the moving 
van idling outside, she says she had little choice but to move in. But now, she 
is running out of hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm living paycheck to paycheck. All the money I have goes right into 
survival," she said, adding that she lives in fear of unexpected expenses, like 
her car breaking down. "Now, with the three-bedroom at $800 and up, I have no 
hope in hell of getting my baby back." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is so desperate. Many tenants are choosing to stay and move into 
the renovated units as they open. Those who can afford to pay more say the 
improvements will come not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was going to crumble the way things were going," said Queenie Murphy, who 
has lived at Loma Palisades since 1960. "I'm sorry for people who can't pay the 
higher rent. But if we're going to upgrade and renovate so we can be proud of 
how we live, then you have to, naturally, pay more. Let them get after the 
government to build more low-cost housing." 
</P>
<P>
When some residents came door-to-door trying to organize a tenant organization, 
Murphy says she gave $10. But she does not support those who bash the new 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for them. It could happen to me," she said. "But attacking men who want 
to invest money -- that's not right. They are not the ones to be attacked for 
improving the neighborhood. I think the new people have done all they can do. 
They've been cooperative, they've been humane. They've gotten rid of some of 
the undesirables, which I am happy about." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliland feels that while she doesn't have much money, she should still be 
considered desirable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a good tenant. I pay my rent. I don't let my children destroy the 
property," she said. "But this is tight for me. At $60 (more), I could probably 
hang on. But at $110 and up, there's no way." 
</P>
<P>
Especially for Gilliland and others whose bare-bones budgets are barely 
balanced, the first edition of the Loma Palisades newsletter was hard to 
stomach. Published by the new owners, the September issue offers tenants 
cheerful suggestions about water conservation -- not to mention an opportunity 
to "get rich on us" by winning $50 for each new tenant referred. 
</P>
<P>
"Loma Palisades isn't just an apartment building, it's an apartment community, 
and we want everyone to be part of it," the newsletter said, urging residents 
to submit their birthdays, wedding anniversaries and baby announcements for 
publication. Tenants who pay their rent on or before Oct. 1, it said, will be 
eligible to win $100 -- "You could be the next BIG WINNER," the newsletter 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the "PROVEN STRESS REDUCERS," a short list that included 
these helpful hints: "Get up fifteen minutes earlier in the morning. That way, 
when something goes wrong (and doesn't it always) you'll have more time to deal 
with it . . . Prepare for the morning the evening before . . . Don't rely on 
your memory . . . Always carry a small pad of paper and a pencil or pen." 
</P>
<P>
"Stress reduction? Ha! If they want that, why did they raise the rents? It's 
laughable," said a woman in her 70s who asked that her name not be used because 
she is moving out and, after more than 20 years as a tenant, wants to get her 
security deposit back. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett says he feels for such people, but wishes they would consider his side. 
</P>
<P>
"The landlord is always caught in a vise. We're caught in the middle because 
we're the new guy, and thus the bad guy," he said. "Not only do we not want to 
manage substandard properties, but by law we can't. . . . If somebody didn't 
step into this property, the county of San Diego would (soon) be saying, 'You 
cannot rent the units.' 
</P>
<P>
"Candidly, I'm very empathetic. But especially when you have senior citizens 
who are living in apartment units that are huge, on a cost-per-square-foot 
basis these are some of the lowest rents in the county," Garrett said, noting 
that Loma Palisades units range from 950 to 1,200 square feet. "Usually senior 
citizens are looking for places that are a little smaller." 
</P>
<P>
If they weren't already, they say they are now. Nanette Scherzer, a 57-year-old 
widow who has lived at Loma Palisades for 11 years, just finished moving from 
her two-bedroom apartment into a less expensive one-bedroom unit in another 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Scherzer didn't want to leave the home she shared with her late husband. When 
he died three years ago, she recalls, the old management offered her a job in 
the rental office -- a gesture of kindness that she has not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
The new management left a different impression. When she told them she could 
not afford the rent hike, she says, they "said, 'Why don't you get a roommate?' 
I said, 'I don't like roommates.' " 
</P>
<P>
With a fixed income of less than $1,000 a month, she had no choice. She hired a 
moving company, said goodby to her neighbors and piece by piece, sold off 
treasured possessions that will not fit in her new 600-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
Once she unpacks, she will return her cardboard boxes to Loma Palisades -- 
they're hard to find these days, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll empty them and pass them on to someone else," she said.

MAKING A POLITICAL SPLASH; 
</P>
<P>
FUND RAISING: ELECTED OFFICIALS PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FOWARD -- ON A LONG 
SURFBOARD -- AT A CELEBRITY SURFING EVENT IN HUNTINGTON BEACH. THERE ARE SOME 
THRILLS, MANY SPILLS.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a conservative approach, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) stayed in 
the low surf and rode the smaller waves. Mayor Thomas J. Mays and Councilman 
John Erskine, on the other hand, shot for glory. They tried to ride the 
crashing, dashing waves close to the pier. The results were mixed: some 
thrills, but many more spills. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lone female in the event, Rhonda Carmony, a 20-year-old aide to 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), used fancy footwork to outscore the five 
other politicos competing in the Mayor's Invitational Celebrity Surf Contest at 
the Huntington Beach Pier. Judges noted, however, that Erskine came in a very 
close second. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine, 39, wowed the cheering crowd on the beach by turning backward on his 
board as it soared on a high wave. The judges gave Erskine a perfect 10 score 
for that feat. But Mayor Mays, 36, said he was not impressed. "That turkey 
Erskine was hotdogging," said Mays, with a big smile. 
</P>
<P>
Mays organized the event to raise money for the city's new Surfing Museum, 
which was launched earlier this year. "Businesses sponsoring this Celebrity 
Contest have donated $3,500, and it's all going to the museum," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
For the crowd at the Huntington Beach Pier, the Celebrity Contest provided 
color and comedy, but few moments of surfing grandeur. The six contestants 
spent more time flailing around in the water than riding on their long-style 
surf boards. And some of the contestants came perilously close to whacking the 
barnacle-covered pier pilings. Nonetheless, the judges said they were 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I didn't expect any of these guys to stand up on their boards," said 
one judge. "So they did a lot better than I predicted." 
</P>
<P>
The contestants, in addition to Rohrabacher, Carmony, Erskine and Mays, were 
former Huntington Beach Mayor Bob Mandic, 49, and Orange County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Chris Evans, 35. Most said they were badly out of shape for surfing, 
having spent more time of late in smoke-filled rooms than in the ocean. They 
poor-mouthed their chances before entering the water for the half-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the longest board, so I should get the biggest handicap," Mays said 
jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the oldest in this thing, so the others ought to be required to surf with 
one hand tied behind," Mandic said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not used to surfing on a long board," Carmony said. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, Rohrabacher said, "I'm used to body surfing, but I haven't 
done any board surfing for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Erskine complained of aging. "It's been five or six years since I was an active 
surfer," he said. "I ought to get a 20-stroke handicap." 
</P>
<P>
The excuses ended abruptly as the air horn signaled them to get into the water. 
The six contestants waded into the surf near the pier, and the judges watched 
from their tents on shore. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't quote us by name," one judge warned. "We don't want to get in trouble 
with these politicians." The judges were surfing experts who had scored 
competitors in the city's two-day 20th Annual Summer Surf Contest. The 
celebrity event was a last-minute addition to the contest. 
</P>
<P>
The judges watched as Mays, out by the pier, rose briefly on his board, only to 
pull back as the wave rolled by him. Said a judge, jokingly, "Typical 
politician. Pulling out at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later Erskine thrilled the crowd with his turn-around steps on 
his surfboard. But one of the judges had a cynical joke: "Now there's a 
politician changing his position. What else is new?" Despite the joking, 
however, the judges said they were genuinely impressed with Erskine's feat. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Ball of San Diego, one of the judges, allowed himself to be quoted by name 
for these comments: "Erskine was the only one to score a 10. Rhonda (Carmony) 
won slightly on points because she was able to stay up longer on her board. But 
actually, all these guys did well. That was a bumpy, choppy, 3- to 4-foot surf 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
The choppy surf pulled the surfers towards the pier pilings. Erskine saved 
himself from injury by throwing up his surfboard like a shield just before a 
wave dashed him against a barnacle-covered pier piling. The collision with the 
piling broke off the rear fin of Erskine's board. "For a while out there I was 
thinking that it might be embarrassing to come back to shore all blood 
covered," said a sheepish Erskine after the event. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mays had jokingly proclaimed there were five second-place finishers, 
the judges' combined tally showed Carmony first, followed in order by Erskine, 
Evans, Rohrabacher, Mays and Mandic. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said he would now go back to Washington and stake his claim to 
fame. "I may not be the best surfer in Huntington Beach," he said, "but I'm 
certainly the best surfer in Congress." 
</P>

CAFETERIAS TASTEFULLY REVAMPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For generations, school cafeteria food has been the butt of campus jokes. Tuna 
Surprise may be nutritious, but it doesn't sell well. 
</P>
<P>
But lunches in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District these days are a little 
different. In an effort to compete for the lunch money of students accustomed 
to eating at fast-food restaurants, the district has opened "food pavilions" in 
its high school cafeterias. Now a student can buy pizza, salad or a stuffed 
potato without having to leave campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to meet the needs and wants of the students," said Jackie 
Kravitz, assistant food services director for the district. "The menu reflects 
food in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
The cafeterias resemble the food courts found in malls, with individual 
stations for each type of food. 
</P>
<P>
And the students seem to agree with the changes. The lunch lines at Estancia 
High School last week were packed. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go off campus last year, but not any more," said 18-year-old R.C. 
Arce, adding that the pizza and Mexican food were his favorites. "This is what 
you'd choose to eat, if you could." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a variety of foods to choose from now, not just one food," said 
15-year-old Naazma Malik. "Last year a lot of people just brought their lunch 
'cause they didn't like the sight of the food." 
</P>
<P>
The district also plans to introduce pushcarts with hot dogs and Chinese food 
and an outdoor grill for hamburgers, Estancia supervisor Jean Mechem said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Kravitz said, "if they don't want peas, they don't have to have peas. But 
this is food they'll eat. Why make a nice nutritious trash can?" 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the new program is to increase revenues. The food services 
department, with an annual budget of about $3 million, cost the district about 
$250,00 last year, according to Assistant Supt. Thomas Godley. With an increase 
in prices of about 15% and the increased participation of students, the 
district hopes that it can make up that loss. 
</P>
<P>
But seniors at one table said the new fare would not be enough to keep them at 
school during the lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the decorations are really funky," said Shannon Curren, 17, "but we 
prefer to eat out. Let's just put it that way." 
</P>
<P>
"It's more fun to go out, and to get a break from school," Kristen Hall, 17, 
added. LAURA MICHAELIS

The percentage of donated blood in Orange County that must be destroyed has 
been climbing and reached 8% last year, according to the American Red Cross. 
Blood is destroyed if it is "reactive" or out of date -- more than 42 days old. 
</P>
<P>
Reactive blood has not necessarily been tainted by AIDS. Red Cross technicians 
also, for example, test blood for reaction to alanine amino transferase (ALT), 
which is a liver enzyme. The presence of ALT is often an indicator of liver 
disease. However, positive reactions can also be produced by the donor having 
consumed one beer the night before, or by taking four Tylenol tablets the day 
of the donation. Thus, one doesn't have to have liver disease to test positive 
for ALT. However, the donated blood will be destroyed as a matter of 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 tests take lab workers up to nine hours to complete. Also, during 
the screening process, donors have several opportunities to confidentially 
self-exclude their donated blood. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at Orange County's recent donation trend and the amount of blood 
that must be destroyed:

POLICE SEARCH AREA OF STABBINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Police conducted an extensive air and ground search Sunday in the 
area where two University City women were slain late last week. 
</P>
<P>
From 6 a.m. until almost 3 p.m., homicide units, in addition to canine, horse, 
helicopter and foot patrols -- a total of 35 officers -- searched canyon areas 
near the murder scene in the 5800 block of Honors Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Pamela Gail Glark, 42, and Amber Michelle Clark, her 18-year-old 
daughter, were found stabbed to death inside the family's residence. The elder 
Clark worked as an assistant to her husband, Joseph Lazzaro, a Mission Hills 
acupuncturist. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Clark was a student at Mesa College and a recent graduate of 
University City High School, where police set up a command post Sunday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the latest slayings may be related to three previous 
stabbing deaths in Clairemont, all involving young women. 
</P>
<P>
In the stabbing death of Holly Suzanne Tarr on April 3, a suspect was seen 
running from the scene.

ARBITER TO DECIDE WHO MUST PAY FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials have signed an agreement to enter into arbitration over who will 
pay $145,000 in legal fees accumulated by former Councilman John Kelly and 
Councilman Earl J. Prescott during a battle over Tustin election dates. 
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Prescott and Kelly are dropping their pending lawsuit and a 
retired judge from outside Orange County will decide who should pay their legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
The fees resulted from two lawsuits Prescott and Kelly filed against the city 
hoping to block the election date change as well as a lawsuit filed against 
them by the city clerk. About $126,000 in fees accumulated by the city already 
have been paid.

TREE ORDINANCE UP FOR VOTE TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council Tuesday will consider a new street tree ordinance that would 
make it clear that the city -- and not its residents -- owns the trees on 
parkways. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance has been years in the making but received new attention when the 
city chopped down about three dozen 70-year-old oak and ash trees on the north 
side of Broadway a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who had lived there for decades were upset and formed a group that 
managed to save the trees on the south side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, residents may plant or remove trees with city permission. The new 
ordinance would leave that to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal allows residents to appeal decisions to the department director, 
who may consult an outside arborist. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, residents had recommended that the appeals be made instead through a 
residents committee, a proposition the council may consider. LISA MASCARO

A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL FOR ALL THE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana's Centennial Park will be the site of a candlelight vigil on Sept. 23 
that will attempt to bring attention to the needs of children throughout the 
world. It is one of 2,400 such vigils being held worldwide on that day. 
</P>
<P>
The event, sponsored by the city of Santa Ana, UNICEF and a coalition of Orange 
County organizations and citizens, will feature speeches, entertainment, 
singing and a candle-lighting ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, more than 40,000 children under the age of 5 die, and most die from 
such preventable causes as malnutrition and dehydration," said Shirley 
Williams, chairwoman for the local vigil. "The world's children need a better 
chance at life." 
</P>
<P>
The vigils are being held to demonstrate public support for the World Summit 
for Children, to be held Sept. 29-30 at the United Nations in New York. More 
than 75 heads of state, including President Bush, are scheduled to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"The summit's goal is to put children high on the agenda of the 1990s, giving 
them priority on our global resources," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the vigil will be devoted to the reading of the "Convention on the 
Rights of a Child," a document which sets minimum standards for the survival, 
health and education of children and also seeks to protect children from 
violence and exploitation, said Barbara Sullivan, program chairwoman for the 
vigil. 
</P>
<P>
The needs of homeless and impoverished children in Orange County will be 
addressed by Jean Forbath, a founder of Share Our Selves, a Costa Mesa-based 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
The event is open to the public. For more information, call (714) 720-0279.

<P>
Into the west-blowing wind, Marianne Wellington sprints uphill, flapping her 
arms up and down. She is calling, "Prrrr! Prrrrrr!" rolling the r's in a 
high-pitched trill. 
</P>
<P>
Behind her follow eight cinnamon-brown chicks on two-foot-long pinkish legs, 
leaping and flapping. From eggs laid in the wild in Northwest Territories, 
Canada, and hatched in captivity in Wisconsin, the chicks, ranging in age from 
7 to 9 weeks, are just discovering what their newly feathered wings are for. 
</P>
<P>
Crane mothering is tiring. "I can only take so much running and then I have to 
rest," said Wellington. 
</P>
<P>
At least she knows her colleagues will not laugh at her. At various times, many 
of them have run around wearing crane costumes and frog-walked backward while 
operating a crane puppet. 
</P>
<P>
For here at the International Crane Foundation, no challenge is too great -- 
nor any effort too silly looking to try -- when it comes to breeding and 
raising cranes, one of the world's most endangered family of birds. Today at 
the facility, the endangered whooping crane is the beneficiary of one of the 
most intensive and innovative efforts staged to protect an American species. 
</P>
<P>
Whooping cranes, the tallest birds in North America, once whitened the skies 
with their migrations. Nearly as tall as a man, with a wingspan that Icarus 
would envy and the voice of a siren's wail, the whooping crane is one of the 
most spectacular birds in North America -- and one of the rarest. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 235 whooping cranes left on the planet, victims of shrinking 
wetland habitat. All are descendants of the remnant population of 15 birds 
counted in 1941 at their summering grounds at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge 
in Texas -- a population that is now protected by U.S. and Canadian law. 
</P>
<P>
"The whooping crane's return from the brink of extinction is one of the most 
encouraging stories in conservation," said George Archibald, founder of ICF. 
</P>
<P>
To save the crane, aviculturists and ornithologists here have dressed up like 
cranes, incubated crane chicks under chickens, and treated birds with deformed 
legs with hydrotherapy. Archibald has even acted as surrogate mate to a captive 
female, performing the species' elaborate courtship dance -- and personally 
incubating a crane egg under his sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation staff have successfully bred 14 of the world's 15 crane species. 
They were the first in the world to breed the rare Siberian and hooded cranes 
native to Asia; the first in North America to breed Brolga cranes, native to 
Australia, and the first -- just last month -- to hatch a black-necked crane 
chick outside of its native China. 
</P>
<P>
Because of ICF's success, the private foundation was selected this year to 
receive 12 crane eggs removed from the nests of whoopers breeding in Canada's 
Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest Territories. Jim Lewis, director of 
the National Whooping Crane Recovery Team, said that whooping cranes normally 
lay two eggs per nest, but only one chick typically survives the summer. 
Artificially incubating the eggs allows twice as many cranes to survive as 
would in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, they hatched out of brown-speckled, greenish eggs warmed and 
moistened in incubators. The whooping chicks were fed by puppets so the chicks 
will know they are whooping cranes and be able to select appropriate mates, 
said Wellington. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a white-sleeved glove with a crane-faced head and scissors-like beak, 
crane aviculturists learn to walk backward, squatting, trying to get the 
uncoordinated babies to eat moistened crane chow off the red spoon protruding 
from the puppet's mouth. All the while, they must play a tape recording of the 
purring brood call of the adult female crane -- a sound solicited for the 
recording by stroking a captive female's back and tail, mimicking the 
pre-copulatory behavior of the male. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret to breeding these birds in captivity is a lot of tender loving 
care," Archibald said. 
</P>
<P>
For a captive female whooper named Tex, that tender loving care extended to 
Archibald actually becoming her mate. Tex, born at the San Antonio Zoo in 1967, 
had been raised in the living room of zoo director Fred Stark. The result of 
its craneless chickhood was a lifelong preference for people instead of 
whooping cranes. When it was passed on to Patuxent Wildlife Research Center 
near Laurel, Md., Tex was unrelentingly cold to potential mates. So the 
Wildlife Service gave it to Archibald in 1976, who at that time was beginning 
to gather crane species for breeding. 
</P>
<P>
To bring Tex to breeding condition required a suitable suitor, but a real crane 
would not do. So Archibald courted the human-imprinted crane. He moved in with 
it, sleeping on a cot in its pen for a month. Tex fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
When spring came, Archibald's attentions increased. Imitating the balletic 
leaping, bowing, bobbing, wing-spreading and neck-flinging of the male partner, 
he performed the crane courtship dance for it. To his joy, Tex responded, 
dancing its part. 
</P>
<P>
The dance, researchers believe, is a necessary step in getting the crane to 
ovulate. It was artificially inseminated with semen from a male whooping crane 
at Patuxent, and in 1982, after several failures, it laid a fertile, healthy 
egg. In the territory Archibald and Tex had staked out on a grassy hillside, 
the two gathered nesting material, foraged together, danced and co-incubated 
the precious egg. Archibald piled his sleeping bag on the nest and set up a 
card table so he could read and write while keeping the egg warm. Meanwhile, 
Tex went foraging. 
</P>
<P>
Later that season, Tex was tragically eaten by a raccoon, but the egg survived 
in an incubator. Gee Whiz hatched on the first of June. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Gee Whiz is "a great big beautiful whooping crane," Archibald said with 
a father's pride. Unlike its mother, Gee Whiz knows it is a crane and will be 
able to select and court an appropriate mate. 
</P>
<P>
Instilling "whooperness" in the cranes is a science of its own, as Patuxent 
staff discovered when it began its breeding program in 1973. Until last fall, 
Patuxent had the only captive breeding flock of whoopers in the nation; last 
year, 22 birds -- half of the Maryland flock -- were moved to Baraboo, to 
protect the captives from a single disaster or disease wiping out the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
These chicks will stay at ICF as breeding stock, but their offspring are slated 
for release in Florida in 1992, forming a new, non-migratory flock of birds 
where a vanished flock once wintered. Because today's chicks are tomorrow's 
breeders, these cranes are taught to tolerate, not fear, their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
For others slated for release into the wild, different protocols are used. That 
is where the crane costumes come in. 
</P>
<P>
Wild cranes are justifiably afraid of humans, who may illegally hunt them or 
disturb their nests. To make sure the group to be released retains that healthy 
fear, ICF ethologist Robert Horwich makes sure he is not mistaken for a human. 
He dresses up his full body in the garb of a crane. 
</P>
<P>
The costume he designed looks like something you might see in a Halloween 
parade -- one sleeve ends with a puppet head, the other is covered in cloth 
feathers. Horwich's body is draped with a gray sheet, and his face is covered 
with an opaque black patch to mimic the sandhill's markings. 
</P>
<P>
Horwich worked with five sandhills until they were fledglings, 10 weeks old, 
and outfitted with radio collars for tracking. They were moved to Necedah 
National Wildlife Refuge, 55 miles north of the foundation's headquarters, 
where they joined a wild group and migrated south to winter in Florida. "It 
makes me feel we've done the right thing, to release them and have them join 
their own kind," Horwich said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, his method has been successfully tried on three other 
captive-hatched species slated for release: red-crowned cranes, Siberian cranes 
and Eastern Sarus cranes. 
</P>
<P>
As less-developed countries begin their captive-breeding programs, the 
foundation offers expertise and advice. Because countries such as China are 
less likely to have newfangled incubators on hand, ICF is experimenting with a 
low-tech solution: chickens. Cochin hens will happily incubate crane eggs, and 
this year's experiments with red-crowned, white-naped and sandhill cranes will 
determine if the method works. 
</P>
<P>
For foreign conservationists, the whooping crane's comeback, and ICF's success, 
are welcome models. "The whooper is like the legendary phoenix bird that rose 
from the ashes," said Archibald. "Not all endangered species are doomed."

SICKLE-CELL TRANSFUSIONS RAISE MEDICAL, ETHICAL ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
BLOOD: A STUDY SUGGESTS THAT DONATIONS FROM BLACKS ARE BETTER FOR VICTIMS OF 
THE DISEASE. BUT IDENTIFYING DONORS MAY VIOLATE PRIVACY AND STIR RACIAL 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors have become embroiled in a delicate ethical debate after a recent study 
suggested that patients with sickle-cell anemia may avoid transfusion 
complications if given blood donated by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether blood banks should ask donors to volunteer information 
about their racial backgrounds, making the search for compatible blood easier, 
and whether blood banks should routinely provide extensive protein-matching of 
donor and recipient blood. Both procedures would decrease the chances of 
sickle-cell patients developing transfusion complications, but they would also 
require more money and raise serious issues of confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the nearly 60,000 people nationwide with sickle-cell disease 
-- an inherited blood disorder that affects blacks almost exclusively -- have 
received at least one transfusion before the age of 18. Roughly 30% of these 
patients, however, develop antibodies against foreign proteins called antigens 
in the blood they receive, a condition known as alloimmunization. 
</P>
<P>
Once antibodies form, it becomes increasingly difficult -- and sometimes nearly 
impossible -- to find compatible blood for subsequent transfusions, increasing 
the likelihood that recipients will suffer from transfusion reactions such as 
jaundice, severe anemia and kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
The research suggests that genetic differences in certain blood antigens 
between whites and blacks may explain, in part, why sickle-cell patients make 
antibodies, said Dr. Elliott P. Vichinsky, co-author of a recent study 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Children's Hospital in Oakland found that 30% of the 107 black 
sickle-cell anemia patients studied who received transfusions developed 
antibodies. Moreover, the scientists discovered that 82% of the antibodies 
sickle-cell patients produced were against four antigens that commonly occur in 
blood donated from whites. In the study, 90% of the blood transfused was 
donated by whites. 
</P>
<P>
"For sickle-cell patients who have already developed antibodies, knowing which 
donors are black could mean a smaller haystack to go looking for the needle 
in," said Dr. Samuel Charache, a hematologist at Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine in Baltimore. In an accompanying editorial, Charache 
encourages blood banks and physicians to debate the merits of asking donors to 
indicate their race, and keeping the information confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Despite suggestions that blacks with sickle-cell anemia may benefit from blood 
donors volunteering information about race, the procedure also raises ethical 
issues. "Black blood for black people and white blood for white people sounds 
like a white water fountain for white people and a colored water fountain for 
colored people. It could be twisted into something totally awful," Charache 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of providing sickle-cell patients with racially matched blood is 
compounded by a tremendous lack of black donors. A 1986 American Red Cross 
survey found that 95% of all blood donors surveyed were white, while 4% were 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Some medical experts, while agreeing that knowledge of a donor's race may help 
in finding more compatible blood for sickle-cell patients, worry about the 
misuse of such information. Dr. Darlene Powers, a pediatric hematologist at the 
USC Medical Center, is concerned that, because blacks tend to carry fewer of 
the most potent antigens that cause transfusion reactions, it is possible that 
blood designated for the benefit of sickle-cell patients might be given to 
whites for a variety of reasons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid such controversies, some physicians recommend that blood banks simply 
provide antigen-matched (rather than race-specific) blood to sickle-cell 
patients even before antibodies develop. But for various reasons, blood banks 
argue that such a service would lead to increased costs and unnecessary delays. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Steven Kleinman of the Los Angeles County American Red Cross said providing 
antigen-matched blood is less expensive and better matches can be found if 
matching is done only for those who develop antibodies to previous 
transfusions. Moreover, transfusing all sickle-cell patients with 
antigen-matched blood would probably exhaust the rare blood supply and result 
in transfusion delays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gerald Sandler, medical director of the national American Red Cross in 
Washington, D.C., remains firm in his stand against altering the Red Cross 
blood banking program, which provides half of the nation's blood supply.

Sandler remains confident that the Red Cross can continue to meet the needs of 
sickle-cell patients through the rare-donor registry program. "We don't have to

Yet Vichinsky says the crisis for sickle-cell patients "will increase with time

A man armed with eight-inch scissors robbed a Thousand Oaks drugstore Saturday 
night, and a 27-year-old transient was arrested a few blocks away, a Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn O'Barr, described as a transient from the San Diego area, was arrested on 
suspicion of armed robbery and was being held Sunday at the Ventura County Jail 
in lieu of $20,000 bail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Mike Kipp said the robber entered a Thrifty Drug Store on North Moorpark 
Road at 8:20 p.m. posing as a customer. He pulled out the scissors in front of 
a cashier and demanded cash, Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber fled with an undisclosed amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
O'Barr was arrested nearby and was identified by witnesses as the thief, Kipp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The money and scissors were not recovered. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

COUNTY DEMOCRATS VOW VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THEY CLOSED THEIR WEEKEND CONVENTION BY REPUDIATING THE PARTY 
CHAIRMAN'S EARLIER CALL TO PURSUE ONLY MODEST ELECTION GOALS.

Orange County Democrats ended their weekend convention on an optimistic note 
Sunday, pledging party unity and surprising results at the polls in November. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not conceding any seat in any race to any Republican," said James 
Toledano, the Democratic candidate trying to unseat Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle 
(R-Huntington Beach). "We have a minimum goal of winning every single race." 
</P>
<P>
Toledano's closing comments came in response to Orange County Democratic Party 
Chairman Michael Balmages' statement Saturday that the party should focus its 
efforts on the modest goal of winning one of 13 state and federal legislative 
races in the county this November -- Thomas Umberg's bid to unseat freshman 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
That statement upset several candidates. While they conceded that they are 
heavy underdogs, they bristle at the suggestion that they have no chance 
whatsoever, and they think that party leaders should refrain from conceding 
their races six weeks before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Toledano and five other candidates confronted Balmages in a meeting Saturday 
evening that both sides described as frank and productive. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages opened Sunday's breakfast meeting by introducing state legislative 
candidates Toledano, Fred Smoller, Peter Mathews, Luanne Pryor and Evelyn Colon 
Becktell, all of whom had been at the Saturday meeting, as "the best group of 
candidates" the county party has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, I found out just how aggressive they are," Balmages said. "They 
indicated to me that they do not have modest goals in this election. . . . They 
will be part of Orange County's new delegation to Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Toledano drafted a resolution calling on the party to abandon any 
"minimum goals" and drop the "negative and self-defeating attitude" displayed 
by some members. 
</P>
<P>
After clearing the air with Balmages and finding strong support from other 
candidates for his resolution, however, Toledano withdrew it, saying it was not 
necessary to put it to a convention vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We are united, and Mike is with us," Toledano said. "We're going to surprise 
everyone in November." 
</P>
<P>
Balmages criticized the media for exaggerating candidates' displeasure with his 
statement Saturday but said that whatever misunderstanding there was had been 
cleared up. "We have not written off anything," he said, adding that, 
"realistically, we won't win them all." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy addressed the convention Sunday, telling delegates that 
this year's election is crucial to the future of the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we'll be a serious factor in California in the 1990s unless 
Dianne Feinstein is elected governor this year," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy himself is being challenged by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach). On Sunday, he acknowledged that she will be "a tough opponent," but 
criticized her for her opposition to abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any candidate for statewide office can be so stridently in favor 
of government intrusion instead of a woman's conscience on the issue of 
abortion," he said.

UNDESERVED SANCTUARY FOR CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
A JUDGE HARUMPHS, AND A PRUDENT GAMBIT TO GAIN CUSTODY OF A MEXICAN NATIONAL IS 
VOIDED.

<P>
Last month, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ordered the federal government 
to follow the genteel Queensberry rules in fighting international drug 
trafficking and terrorism. In the case, U.S. vs. Rafael Caro-Quintero, he 
harumphed against a prudent gambit by the Drug Enforcement Administration to to 
seek custody of a Mexican national indicted here for complicity in the torture 
and murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Mexico. If Rafeedie's 
muddle-headed ruling survives appeal, a legal sanctuary abroad will have been 
erected for despicable crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, DEA agent Enrique Camarena was kidnaped, tortured and murdered by a 
Mexican drug trafficking ring. Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain and a score of 
others were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of collaborating. 
Representatives of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police offered to deliver 
Alvarez to the United States for trial if a $50,000 douceur was paid in 
advance, but the DEA demurred. 
</P>
<P>
A DEA agent had simultaneously offered a handful of his Mexican contacts a 
$50,000 reward if Alvarez were delivered to the custody of the United States. 
The monetary enticement brought about the abduction of Alvarez. The Mexican 
government protested the kidnaping to the State Department three times, on the 
grounds that it circumvented an extradition treaty between Mexico and the 
United States. Rafeedie took notice of the protests, ruled that the treaty 
violation deprived the United States of jurisdiction to try Alvarez and ordered 
him repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court declared in Frisbie vs. Collins (1952) that it "has never 
departed from the rule . . . that the power of a court to try a person for a 
crime is not impaired by the fact that he had been brought within the court's 
jurisdiction by reason of forcible abduction. . . . There is nothing in the 
Constitution that requires a court to permit a guilty person to escape justice 
because he was brought to trial against his will." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, as Rafeedie conceded, if no extradition treaty had existed, Alvarez's 
jurisdictional claim would have failed. Rafeedie's conclusion that a treaty 
violation frustrates jurisdiction perversely discourages extradition 
arrangements because they add to the defendants' legal arsenal to circumvent 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Extradition treaties are constructive adjuncts to international law 
enforcement, and are ordinarily preferable to abduction or other stratagems for 
gaining custody of a defendant. The latter, however, are sometimes imperative 
if the extradition process has been corrupted, or if the nation of sanctuary 
would resist extradition to escape political embarrassment. The "anti-Yankee" 
political culture and government venality pervasive in Latin America thus make 
U.S. reliance on extradition to obtain jurisdiction over fugitives foolish. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie's ruling usurped authority to decide a foreign-policy question fit 
only for President Bush. International obligations stemming from extradition 
treaties confer rights on nations, not individuals. The Mexican government 
formally protested Alvarez's abduction to the State Department, not to 
Rafeedie. The department, as the foreign-policy voice of the President, denied 
Mexico's demands for Alvarez's return. 
</P>
<P>
Bush might have believed that Mexico's demands reflected insincere political 
posturing for the benefit of a Mexican constituency, or that Mexican 
retaliation was unlikely because its failure to cooperate with the United 
States in fighting drug trafficking would trigger losses in American trade and 
economic benefits. In any event, the U.S. response to accusations of 
international law transgressions turns on quintessential political 
considerations alien to the understanding, expertise and responsibilities of 
federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie also errantly held the DEA responsible for Alvarez's abduction by 
private individuals solely because of its reward offer. That responsibility was 
the linchpin of his finding of an extradition-treaty violation. But a financial 
inducement to private conduct is no justification for imputing government legal 
responsibility. The United States offers rewards of up to $500,000 to persons 
furnishing information leading to the arrest of terrorists, but it is not 
legally answerable for private searches, seizures or surveillances occasioned 
by that allurement. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie's decree that the United States play exclusively by Queensberry rules 
in attacking international criminals has a place in Utopia, but not in a world 
that must cope with unsavory criminal acts.

DRIVER FLEEING ATTACKERS SHOT, KILLED AFTER HITTING FIRETRUCK

A motorist apparently fleeing from gang members was shot to death early Sunday 
after his car collided with a firetruck near the USC campus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim tried to run from the scene but was "felled by multiple gunshots" 
fired by a masked man in a pursuing car as firefighters looked on, Los Angeles 
police Detective Dick Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Valenzuela, 22, was pronounced dead on arrival at California Medical 
Center shortly after the 2:10 a.m. incident. 
</P>
<P>
"This appears to be a gang-related shooting," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the chase began after Valenzuela and an 18-year-old friend were 
shot at from a passing vehicle carrying at least two other men while they sat 
in their car at a gas station at Hoover and 23rd streets. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela and his companion then drove south on Hoover, toward the USC campus 
10 blocks away, with the gunman's car following, Simmons said. When the 
speeding cars turned onto West Jefferson Boulevard, however, they encountered a 
firetruck pulling into Fire Station 15 after completing an emergency run. 
</P>
<P>
Although a firefighter was in the street stopping traffic, "the first vehicle 
struck the firetruck as it was backing into quarters," Los Angeles City Fire 
Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men got out and ran as a passenger in the second car, wearing a ski 
mask, exited with a shotgun and began firing. Firefighters immediately called 
police, but Valenzuela was felled on the sidewalk near the northern border of 
the USC campus, Simmons said. No one else was hurt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not know the identity of the gunman or the motive for the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
There was only minor damage to the firetruck, Acevedo said.

NO CHARGES FOR PREACHER IN DEATH OF TRANSVESTITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A minister for the homeless has been released from County Jail after 
prosecutors decided not to file a murder charge against him in the death of a 
transvestite prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Ray Belloff, 58, was arrested Tuesday by San Diego police investigating 
the death of a man dressed as a woman. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Donald Pierce, 36, was struck by a car and dragged about 50 feet by 
a brown station wagon at about 3:30 a.m. Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 38th Street and University Avenue, where Pierce 
reportedly worked as a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the case, the district attorney's office decided not to file a 
murder charge and Belloff was released from jail Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney spokeswoman Linda Miller said Friday that witnesses to the 
incident told police that Pierce apparently had robbed the minister. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently Mr. Pierce ripped off Mr. Belloff, took his money, and left his 
vehicle," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Belloff) hit Mr. Pierce (with the car) but didn't know it. We had no way 
of showing Mr. Belloff intended to hurt Mr. Pierce." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said she did not know why Pierce was in Belloff's car, but another 
witness who was also present and slightly injured verified to prosecutors that 
Pierce had robbed Belloff. 
</P>
<P>
Belloff, who has a ministry for the homeless under the name of Christ's 
Missionary, said two of his followers who came to the county courthouse 
Thursday. The two young men told a reporter that Belloff's congregation is 
larger at certain times of the year due to weather conditions, because the 
congregation is composed of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The minister's wife, Beth Belloff, told a reporter Sunday that her husband's 
arrest was a mistake. She said her husband was in the area that night looking 
for homeless people who needed jobs. She said her husband's ministry is near 
the corner of University and Euclid avenues in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Belloff was robbed by Pierce, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said reports of her husband's arrest were embarrassing to their ministry 
but that they would continue their programs for the homeless in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce was the fourth transvestite to die violently in San Diego since June, 
but even before Belloff was released, police said this incident was not related 
to the other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Two transvestites were shot to death in June near the San Diego Wild Animal 
Park, and another was killed in Normal Heights in early July.

The instant-replay rule is a great idea, but the execution -- or non-execution 
-- of it still stinks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were lucky when a failure to communicate kept the press box 
official from looking at a replay that showed Mervyn Fernandez didn't have both 
feet in-bounds on what was ruled a 45-yard completion from Jay Schroeder during 
a touchdown drive early in the fourth quarter in Seattle Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Was that Jay Schroeder or Joe Montana on the Raiders' winning touchdown drive? 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough call, but the Raiders should have gone for the sure three points 
from less than a yard out when it was 3-3 late in the first half. If you don't 
score a touchdown most of the time in that situation, at least you've pinned in 
the opposition. But, in this case, the Seahawks only had to run one play before 
halftime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Besides, once the Raiders lined up, everybody in the Kingdome knew that Marcus 
Allen was going over the top. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to believe that Jim Everett already has passed for more yardage in 
his Ram career than Bob Waterfield. . . .

Tom Lasorda left Mike Morgan in too long Sunday. . . .

This is the year of lost opportunity for the Dodgers, who blew leads of 10 and 
seven runs at home to Philadelphia and Houston, respectively, and left the 
bases loaded three times in the most important game of the season in 
Cincinnati. . . .

<P>
Oh well, when the Dodgers fell behind, 8-2, in the fifth inning, I was able to 
give the remote control a rest and concentrate on the Raider-Seattle game. . .

Washington, which held Purdue to zero net yards rushing. . . .

Ty Detmer's remarkable start means most of the nation, including L.A., will get

Quite a hat trick for Oregon State -- consecutive losses to Montana, Kansas and

If you think the Notre Dame-Michigan game was long, you should have watched the

<P>
When the Washington Redskins kicked off to the San Francisco 49ers Sunday, 
there was a perception that the 49ers, Rams and Redskins are the NFL's three 
best teams -- if not in that order. 
</P>
<P>
Before the end of the third quarter, however, the Redskins had dropped out -- 
at least for the time being -- when they couldn't score a touchdown against a 
San Francisco linebacker, ex-Raider Matt Millen, with first and goal at the San 
Francisco one-foot line. 
</P>
<P>
As the 49ers returned toward respectability after a slow Monday night in New 
Orleans, their timely goal-line stand made the defensive team a partner with 
Joe Montana and the offense in a 26-13 conquest of one of the East's best 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Montana passed 44 times, completing 29 for 390 yards and two touchdowns, to 
keep the champions ahead from the first quarter on, although, at a critical 
moment in the second half, he threw the only interception of a game that was 
played with no fumbles and no sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big step up from the way we looked (in New Orleans)," Montana said. 
"You can't throw without great protection." 
</P>
<P>
Said 49er Coach George Seifert: "This was the best we've played as a team 
(since the Super Bowl), but we did give up some big plays." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest, potentially, was Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien's 40-yard 
third-quarter pass to wide receiver Gary Clark, who was driven out of bounds at 
the 49ers' one-foot line by their new safety, Dave Waymer. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were leading, 20-10, but they hadn't made a first down since the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Waymer's touchdown-saving tackle was followed by the goal-line stand that 
featured Millen on all three downs. On the third, he crashed through to sack 
Rypien for a two-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins took a field goal there, closing to 20-13, but they had lost an 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
In his big third quarter, Rypien twice moved the Redskins into touchdown 
position before the 49ers twice forced them into field-goal formation, and then 
blocked one of the two field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have gotten more than three points there," Rypien said. "We got 
ourselves back into the ballgame, but. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Too much defense. 
</P>
<P>
Said Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs: "We had our opportunities, but we just didn't get 
the job done. When we blitzed (Montana), he hit the slants (pattern pass 
routes)." 
</P>
<P>
Too much Montana. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, it seems likely that the 49ers' indifferent game in the 
Louisiana Superdome Monday night was because it was the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
"We hardly ever played our starters more than a quarter in the preseason," 
Seifert said. "So against the Saints, we were out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
Most noticeably in New Orleans, Montana was "out of sync" with his wide 
receivers, Jerry Rice and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
But after practicing with them then and through another week, Montana threw 
eight passes to Taylor for 160 yards and six to Rice for 74. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they outproduced Washington's so-called posse -- wide receivers Art 
Monk, Ricky Sanders and Gary Clark -- of whom only Clark stood out, with seven 
catches for 106 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington problem seemed to be Rypien's nervousness. He is an accurate 
passer, and he has the arm to throw the football as far as he wants to, but on 
the same field with Montana he seemed to lack some confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien drove the Redskins repeatedly -- and often impressively -- but only once 
all the way. Typical of the lapses that hurt Washington was Rypien's 
second-quarter pass to a well-covered deep receiver, Monk, when another 
Redskin, halfback Kelvin Bryant, was open 10 yards away in Monk's direction. 
</P>
<P>
Montana would have seen Bryant easily, and quickly. Rypien only had eyes for 
Monk, who couldn't catch it when surrounded by 49er safety Ronnie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Redskins) had us reeling," 49er linebacker Millen said in a reference to 
Rypien's numerous long drives. "But on the big plays, we had just the right 
(defensive) calls from the bench." 
</P>
<P>
It was a game in which Montana had the 49ers ahead in the first quarter, 3-0; 
in the second, 10-0; at halftime, 20-10; after three quarters, 23-13; and early 
in the fourth, 26-13. 
</P>
<P>
Second-quarter 49er touchdown drives of 67 and 80 yards were followed before 
halftime by the longest scoring drive of the game, Rypien's. It lasted 83 yards 
and ended with a 35-yard pass to Monk in the end zone on fourth and six. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien and the other offensive players were walking off the field after a 
third-down incompletion when Gibbs waved them back in to go for it on fourth 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Montana's touchdown passes were thrown to Rice for 12 yards and to Taylor for 
49. Rice was running a slant pattern in front of Redskin cornerback Darrell 
Green when Montana hit him in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was running down the left sideline -- with the other 49ers massed right 
-- when Montana's pass reached him after he had raced past a single-covering 
Redskin cornerback, Martin Mayhew. It was a 20-yard pass followed by a 29-yard 
sprint. 
</P>
<P>
On Montana's only interception, Rice was waiting for the ball instead of 
fighting for it when Green stepped in front of him and took it away. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been a serious mistake, but not Sunday. The Redskins aren't yet 
ready to play on even terms with the 49ers -- or with the Rams.

AFC: ESIASON'S THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES HELP CINCINNATI COME BACK FROM A 13-0 
DEFICIT AND WIN, 21-16.

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Chargers lost another close one Sunday, falling, 21-16, to the 
Cincinnati Bengals before 48,098 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' last 14 games have been decided by seven or fewer points, with 10 
ending in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like reaching for that stick so you don't fall off the cliff, and then 
someone moves the stick away from you," Charger safety Vencie Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers squandered a 14-10 fourth-quarter lead a week ago to lose to 
Dallas, 17-10, and then Sunday had a 16-14 edge go by the wayside down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals (2-0), known not so long ago in their own right as a bungling 
fourth-quarter outfit, got three touchdown passes from Boomer Esiason, with the 
third completing the come-from-behind victory. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-yard scoring pass to James Brooks early in the second quarter cut a 13-0 
San Diego lead to 13-7, and a 30-yard scoring pass to Eddie Brown just before 
haltime made it 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
Then a questionable touchdown pass to Brown from 23 yards out less than three 
minutes into the fourth quarter gave the Bengals the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those games where we were going to find out if we could win," 
Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche said. "It was a game of big plays, and Eddie Brown 
is a name that jumps out at you when you think of big plays." 
</P>
<P>
Brown caught 10 passes for 178 yards, including his disputed 23-yard touchdown 
reception on third down and 20 with 12:08 to play. Brown maneuvered his way 
behind cornerback Donald Frank and appeared to push off the rookie just before 
falling back to make the winning catch. 
</P>
<P>
"They called interference on us," Coach Dan Henning said. "Some of our players 
came off saying it was the other way around, but that's the way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals' first score was to a wide open Brooks, the former Charger running 
back, who was supposed to be covered by Byrd. Byrd was also on the coverage 
when Brown hauled in Esiason's 30-yard touchdown pass later in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing soft out there, I was just flopping around the field like I was 
in another world," said Byrd, who had an interception -- his career 26th -- to 
move into second place on the team's all-time list. "I should have made that 
play on the ball to Brown; it cost us." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' popgun offense, which has scored more than 30 points but once in 
its last 43 games, jumped out to a 13-0 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joe Tolliver, who was starting in place of Mark Vlasic, hit Plan B 
acquisition Ronnie Harmon for a 36-yard touchdown pass play on the team's first 
offensive series. After an Esiason pass was intercepted, the first of three, 
Tolliver went 17 yards to fourth-year H-back Joe Caravello for Caravello's 
first NFL touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
On the extra-point try, however, defensive lineman George Hinkle was penalized 
for illegal use of the hands. After being pushed back 15 yards, Fuad Reveiz's 
try for the extra point was blocked by James Francis.

IN WILSON VS. KRAMER, IT'S NO CONTEST; VIKINGS ROLL

<P>
Wade Wilson passed for 212 yards and three touchdowns and connected on two key 
passes just before halftime Sunday to turn a close game into a rout, leading 
the Minnesota Vikings to a 32-3 victory over the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Wade was probably as alive as I've seen him," Viking Coach Jerry Burns 
said. "He had a take-charge attitude." 
</P>
<P>
While Wilson was completing 16 of 24 passes and starring for the Vikings, his 
former teammate and adversary, Tommy Kramer, was a goat for the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer was signed by the Saints during training camp after having been cut last 
off-season by the Vikings. He spent 13 years in Minnesota, the last three as 
Wilson's rival in an often bitter quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Saint starter John Fourcade sustained a concussion in the second 
quarter, forcing Kramer into the game for four series. He was one for three for 
two yards, was sacked twice and threw an interception during the Vikings' key 
spurt just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings were thrilled to see the nimble Fourcade exit in favor of the 
35-year-old Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs were dancing," nose tackle Henry Thomas said. "I said, 'Oh good, we 
don't have to chase that other guy.' 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't wait. For years in practice, all I heard was, 'Hank, don't hit the 
quarterback.' But, oh, this time I could. And I got him." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he felt sorry for Kramer, Wilson said: "No. Why should I? I don't feel 
sorry for him. I don't feel happy for him. I don't feel anything for him." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer, who often fanned the flames of competition in the past, had nicer words 
for Wilson this time: "I thought he played extremely well. I want him to do 
well -- against other teams." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson wasn't the only star for the Vikings (1-1), who have won 13 straight 
home games. Mike Merriweather had two interceptions, Mark Dusbabek recorded a 
safety and Minnesota forced five turnovers. Hassan Jones had four receptions 
for 103 yards. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans, still without a touchdown this season, is off to its first 0-2 
start in Jim Mora's five seasons as coach.

STEELERS OVERCOME THEIR ANEMIC OFFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
AFC: DEFENSE AND SPECIAL TEAMS KEY FIRST HOME VICTORY AGAINST A CENTRAL 
DIVISION TEAM IN NEARLY THREE YEARS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With an offense that has proved inept this season, the Pittsburgh Steelers 
turned to their defense and special teams for touchdowns Sunday night against 
the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
David Johnson returned an interception 26 yards and Rod Woodson returned a punt 
52 yards for touchdowns as the Steelers beat the Oilers, 20-9, for their first 
home victory against a Central Division opponent in nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers (1-1), whose offense has not produced a touchdown this season, had 
not won against a division team at Three Rivers Stadium since beating 
Cincinnati, 23-20, on Oct. 25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler quarterback Warren Moon completed 24 of 48 passes for 284 yards, but he 
threw four interceptions as Houston, thwarted by turnovers for the second 
consecutive week, lost at Pittsburgh for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Moon has thrown six interceptions in two games after throwing seven in his 
previous 350 pass attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"We still haven't scored points, but the defense bailed us out again," 
Pittsburgh running back Tim Worley said. "But you can't expect them to do that 
every week. The offense has great practices, but then I don't know what happens 
in the games." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers (0-2), who outgained the Steelers, 309-123, have seen four of their 
turnovers returned for touchdowns -- three in a 47-27 loss to Atlanta and 
former Coach Jerry Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Anderson added 31 and 27-yard field goals for the Steelers, who were 
coming off a 13-3 loss to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, subbing for the injured Delton Hall, intercepted Moon's first pass of 
the game, which deflected off the hand of receiver Ernest Givins. Johnson 
bobbled the ball momentarily, then grabbed it and ran into the end zone 
untouched at 11:31 of the first quarter for the Steelers' first touchdown of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:11 left in the game, Woodson went 52 yards down the left sideline for 
Pittsburgh's first punt-return touchdown since Louis Lipps' 71-yarder on Nov. 
10, 1985, against Kansas City. The punt-return score was the first against 
Houston since 1978.

JUDGING A FOOTBALL TEAM BY ITS COVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clothes may make the man, at least in terms of public perception. When it comes 
to football, however, uniforms rarely shape the team. Sometimes, the best they 
can do is disguise it. 
</P>
<P>
In a world of changing fashion, the majority of NFL teams are content to wear 
last year's threads. Consider that only four of the 28 clubs reported additions 
to their basic wardrobe for the 1990 season. Note that the San Francisco 49ers, 
the current dynasty in progress, were not among them. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, teams that are successful are reluctant to make even minor 
alterations. For those at or near the bottom of the standings, a new look is 
symbolic of an impending change in fortune. At the very least, it offers 
evidence that management is willing to do something in order to reverse the 
decaying process. "It's a lot easier to change a helmet, a jersey and a logo," 
noted one team official, "than the won-loss record." 
</P>
<P>
Add one more disposable item: the coach. It so happens that all four NFL clubs 
that have varied their outward appearances this year also introduced new 
coaches last Sunday. Among them, the New York Jets, Atlanta Falcons, Phoenix 
Cardinals and New England Patriots were 17-47 in 1989, which indicates that the 
former coaches and uniforms just weren't doing the job. Three of the four clubs 
suffered defeats in their first games of the new season. 
</P>
<P>
The team that made the most dramatic cosmetic change, the Falcons, also 
demonstrated the greatest improvement last Sunday in a crunching victory over 
the Houston Oilers. Was it the new black-on-black hats and black jerseys? Was 
it the presence of Jerry Glanville on the sideline? Was it the pair of tickets 
the new head man left for Elvis? Perhaps it was a combination of all three and 
the emotion of opening at home against the coach's former employers. Now comes 
the tough part: a road encounter at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
New England informed NFL Properties, the marketing arm of the league, that it 
was planning to wear red pants with its white road jerseys, as it did earlier 
in the decade. Phoenix is introducing a similar concept. And the Jets began the 
Bruce Coslet era in Cincinnati last week with a new item of attire, pants of a 
bright green hue usually confined to country clubs, matched with their white 
jerseys. Alas, they did not sport the usual collection of whales, lobsters or 
sailboats favored by the golfing set.

<TEXT>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, the New York Jets waived Freeman McNeil, the team's 
all-time leading rusher with 7,146 yards. 
</P>
<P>
When the former UCLA standout went unclaimed by another team, the Jets brought 
McNeil back for his 10th season. 
</P>
<P>
The move paid off Sunday against the Cleveland Browns as McNeil rushed for 62 
yards and caught three passes for 80 yards as the Jets beat the Browns, 24-21, 
to give Bruce Coslet his first victory as the team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Freeman's too old," Coslet said with a big smile creasing his face after his 
successful home debut. "He can't do it anymore. You saw that." 
</P>
<P>
McNeil has been a starter in both of the Jets' games this season because Blair 
Thomas -- the Jets' No. 1 draft pick -- has been slowed by a hamstring injury, 
and Johnny Hector is just approaching peak shape after arthroscopic knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil and quarterback Ken O'Brien connected on a 59-yard pass play in the 
first quarter that was the longest of McNeil's career. He ran all the way to 
the one and Brad Baxter got the touchdown two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets' defense was stingy in the first half and pressured Bernie Kosar 
throughout the game. Cleveland, which had only 80 yards rushing last week, was 
limited to 44 against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar completed 24 of 41 passes for 233 yards. O'Brien completed 13 of 21 
passes for 218 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns (1-1) got off to a fast start when Eric Metcalf returned the opening 
kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But the Jets (1-1) came right back with a 68-yard, four-play drive highlighted 
by Thomas' 55-yard run with a screen pass that set up McNeil's two-yard scoring 
run. 
</P>
<P>
New York went ahead, 14-7, with a 90-yard drive that took just six plays. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Thomas was a key figure with a 25-yard run. On the next play, Anthony 
Blaylock was called for pass interference at the Cleveland 27. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Hector scored from the six. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Leahy added a 47-yard field goal after the Jets recovered a Metcalf fumble, 
giving the Jets a 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised at how they came back after Eric's touchdown," Browns 
Coach Bud Carson said.

MATADORS LOSE 2ND SAN DIEGO MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 1-0 nonconference loss to the University of San Diego on Sunday left the Cal 
State Northridge men's soccer team scoreless for its San Diego trip. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors began their two-game San Diego set with a 1-0 double-overtime loss 
to San Diego State on Friday, and their offensive woes continued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
USD scored the game's only goal with less than nine minutes remaining in the 
first half. Forward Paul Gelvezon scored the goal, his sixth of the season, 
when he headed in a corner kick from midfielder Toby Taitano. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge managed only five shots on goal and had its best chance to tie late 
in the second half. The Matadors' Danny Daniels kicked a bullet shot that hit 
the left goal post square and bounced back from the goal. Granted the reprieve, 
USD goalie Tom Tate recorded his third shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
USD finished with nine shots on Northridge goalies Joel Entrenken and Jason 
Cherry. Entrenken was removed after receiving a yellow card around the 37th 
minute of the match. Cherry played the remainder of the match. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge fell to 2-4-1 and 0-2-1 in its last three games. San Diego, tied for 
fifth in the Western Region coaches' poll, is 4-0-3. 
</P>
<P>
In another soccer match: 
</P>
<P>
Southern Colorado 5, Occidental 2 -- Dirk Hogan and Cam McInnis scored 
second-half goals for visiting Occidental in the nonconference match. Southern 
Colorado led, 2-0, at halftime.

in sudden death overtime to open the season last Tuesday. Long shots to crack 
the Top 10 include San Clemente, Buena Park, Canyon and Edison. San Clemente 
won the 15-and-under section of the Junior National tournament but still might 
be a year, or even two years away from the finals. . . . Corona del Mar has a 
new pool that might be the best in the county. UC Irvine's tournament was held 
there last weekend. The Sea Kings, three-time defending 4-A champion, will face 
their first big test Tuesday when they play host to defending 3-A champion El 
Toro. . . . Edison looks like the top team in the Sunset League with four 
returning all-league players. . . . The season's best indicator of top teams 
will come Sept. 27-29 in the South Coast League tournament.

USC PILOT PROJECT WILL CUSTOMIZE COLLEGE TEXTBOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A technological revolution is brewing on college campuses. And if the 
insurgents win, the venerable college textbook, as well as the traditional 
campus bookstore, will be forever changed. 
</P>
<P>
Textbook publishers are offering new computer and printing systems that allow 
professors to custom-design textbooks by handpicking course materials from 
electronic databases stocked with traditional textbooks, magazine articles and 
other published information. These customized books can be printed in limited 
quantities by the campus bookstore and distributed to students, sometimes 
within hours -- not weeks or months -- after ordering. 
</P>
<P>
The first of these systems nationwide, to be operated at USC in partnership 
with McGraw-Hill, is to be announced this morning on the Los Angeles campus. 
During the three-year partnership, USC and McGraw-Hill, the nation's 
second-largest college textbook publisher, will also develop new electronic 
course materials and explore ways to link the customized publishing system to 
an electronic library under development at the university. 
</P>
<P>
USC's first customized textbooks are scheduled to roll off the campus 
bookstore's new presses next January. Although just a few books -- including 
business and law texts -- will be available initially for customization, 
university officials said they expect dozens of professors to participate in 
the program for the fall, 1991, semester. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real revolution in how we deliver the textbook to the student," said 
Carl Tyson, president of McGraw-Hill's college textbook division. "We have been 
talking about doing this for 20 years, but this is the first real step." 
</P>
<P>
With the USC pilot project, McGraw-Hill is taking the early lead in a battle to 
bring new computer and publishing technology to the $2-billion-per-year college 
text market. If the experiment succeeds at the university level, publishers 
say, it will be only a matter of time before elementary and secondary schools 
are offered textbook customizing services. 
</P>
<P>
Customized teaching materials are nothing new, particularly on campus, where 
professors have long created anthologies of printed materials for their 
classes. But with advances in computers, databases and printing, professors 
have access to a greatly expanded range of materials, allowing them to put 
their personal stamp on their curriculum through creative packaging of course 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
The new technology is particularly important in fast-moving fields such as law 
and science, where developments can render portions of textbooks outdated 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The new technology also could permanently alter the role of the traditional 
campus bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
After years of losing business to the copy shops that ring a campus, bookstores 
can fight back by getting into publishing and, perhaps, eventually into 
managing on-line database services. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Green, a senior researcher at USC's Center for Scholarly Technology, 
said students and professors will some day dial up texts and other software 
data from personal computers on campus and in their dormitory room, bypassing 
the bookstore entirely. However, the bookstore's role would be to manage the 
computer systems and keep track of student usage and charges. 
</P>
<P>
Already at USC, students are issued magnetic-tape-encoded identification badges 
that can be used as "debit cards" to pay for purchases at the bookstore and 
campus eateries. Green envisions that students would use these same cards to 
gain access and pay for services at the university's new electronic library and 
database. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw-Hill isn't alone. Simon &amp; Schuster, the nation's largest textbook 
publisher, and Follett Corp., the nation's largest operator of college 
bookstores, are working together to print customized textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw-Hill said the new customized textbooks can be a bargain for students 
because professors will typically only want to reprint a portion of the 
traditional textbook, and prices will be based on the amount actually inserted 
into the customized version. For example, the first book in McGraw-Hill's 
project, an accounting text by Robert and Walter Meigs, usually costs $43.95. 
But the first customized versions have included only a fraction of the text and 
cost far less. 
</P>
<P>
Because McGraw-Hill also pays royalties to authors based on the amount 
reprinted, authors -- particularly those of widely used introductory texts -- 
could find their royalty checks shrinking as professors use only part of their 
tomes.

DID EPILADY FLEECE MORE THAN LEGS?;

<P>
BANKRUPTCY: HOPE AND HYPE HELPED PUSH EPI PRODUCTS OVER THE EDGE. LESS 
CHARITABLE CREDITORS BLAME FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rich young Krok sisters were masterful at selling the success story that 
made them famous. 
</P>
<P>
Even as their family's legal problems mounted and their firm sank into Chapter 
11 bankruptcy last month, the four sisters appeared smiling on the cover of 
Family Business magazine. The publication credited the Kroks with creating "an 
important force in the personal care products industry." 
</P>
<P>
For the Kroks' Santa Monica company, EPI Products USA, glamorous, enticing 
images were essential sales tools. Its one-time smash hit product, the Epilady, 
was an electric hair removal gadget that promised women soft, silky legs -- 
that is, if they used the device every two weeks, an ordeal that some said was 
excruciating. 
</P>
<P>
"You had Johnny Carson and Arsenio Hall on television talking about how painful 
it was, but you had millions of ladies buying it. It became bigger than the 
Hula-Hoop," said Richard L. Faun, a senior sales executive with EPI until 
quitting Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Today, EPI's collapse is an example of the hazards of hype, over-optimism and, 
some creditors allege, of wild spending and financial fraud. Consumers got so 
caught up in the Epilady fad that many who shouldn't have bought them -- women 
who couldn't tolerate the pain -- got the gadgets anyway, only to return them 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The South African-born Krok sisters, meanwhile, may have let their meteoric 
rise go to their heads. Business people who dealt with the Kroks and their 
associates say they ignored suggestions on how to manage EPI more 
professionally -- advice that, critics contend, was needed badly when the 
firm's annual sales (after returns) zoomed to more than $150 million quickly 
after Epilady was introduced in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, a batch of private lawsuits accuse privately held EPI and some of 
the people behind the firm -- notably Solomon Krok, the sisters' father -- of 
looting the company and cheating business associates out of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"EPI's officers and controlling shareholders used EPI as their personal piggy 
bank," charges a suit by the Bank of New York, Daiwa Bank and Bank One. The EPI 
principals, the suit says, secretly diverted "more than $20 million into other 
enterprises in which they were personally involved," including a Broadway play, 
real estate and automotive supplies. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit filed in New York Thursday, a Bank of New York vice president 
contends that he was told by an EPI lawyer that Solomon Krok this spring 
received a "preferential transfer" of at least $3 million from the company. 
According to the affidavit, the payment was authorized because the elder Krok 
"had been threatened with prosecution under South African law for violation of 
currency control regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Allan Browne, an attorney for the Kroks, said he knows of no investigations of 
the Kroks, either in the United States or South Africa. He said the banks' suit 
consists of "wild and reckless charges that have no basis in fact." 
</P>
<P>
Browne maintained that the Kroks never misrepresented how they were going to 
use their $25-million bank loan. In fact, he said, the investments in the play 
and other ventures were intended to diversify EPI and promote the company. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have been, in retrospect, that those investments were not wise and 
didn't pay off, but that's not fraud," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through Browne, the Kroks blamed EPI's collapse mainly on softness in 
the entire retail industry, over-optimistic sales projections and the 
money-losing investments. They also cited what now appears to be excessive 
advertising spending and the high cost of developing new products. 
</P>
<P>
"The company simply grew too fast, and in the process of growing too fast, it 
consumed its capital too quickly," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the raft of litigation and so soon after EPI's fall, what really happened 
is unclear. The Kroks declined to be interviewed, but they authorized Browne 
and Geoffrey D. Lurie, a turnaround specialist EPI hired just before the 
bankruptcy filing, to comment. 
</P>
<P>
What emerges from legal documents and interviews is a picture filled with 
contradictions, a family that was warm, friendly and close-knit but also nasty 
at times toward outsiders. The sisters are described as deft marketers and 
unrelenting negotiators, yet naive about other aspects of business. Their 
father is portrayed as philanthropic yet someone who, the banks allege, 
orchestrated a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Even the matter of who really ran EPI is murky. The three sisters with EPI from 
early on -- 30-year-old Arlene Krok, Sharon Krok Feuer, 32, and Loren Krok, 25 
-- all worked long days and indisputably played significant roles. Arlene, who 
carried the title of president, was considered the street-smart leader, while a 
fourth sister, Bernice Krok, 26, didn't come aboard until a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In EPI's bid to capitalize on its winning "women making products for women" 
image, some key male executives stayed out of the spotlight. EPI's banks 
maintain that the sisters' father was the true boss, even though he professed 
to be no more than a consultant. Solomon Krok, known to his acquaintances as 
Solly, was said by a former company insider to call EPI daily to instruct 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
One executive who did business with EPI said that when he talked with the 
firm's principals, "it was always 'Solly said this, Solly said that.' " 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Solly is the original source of the family's wealth. He made a 
fortune with Twins Pharmaceuticals, a company he has run with his twin brother, 
Abraham, and whose stock is traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Solly, a 61-year-old father of seven, is no stranger to controversy. In South 
Africa, Twins has dominated the market for skin lighteners, which are popular 
among black consumers there but have come under fire from health authorities. 
Twins contested, unsuccessfully, a recent order by South Africa's health 
minister requiring any skin lightener containing a substance called 
hydroquinone to be sold only by pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
Twins also is expected to clash with South African officials over its reported 
plans to export some of the restricted creams, which the company contends are 
harmful only when misused. A Twins official was quoted in a South African 
newspaper as saying that the company intends to sell the products to nearby 
countries, including Zambia, Namibia and Botswana, none of which ban these skin 
lighteners. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after daughter Arlene came to Los Angeles in her late teens, Solly set 
her up in business by giving her the U.S. rights to a product for bathing 
infants called the Baby Sitter. Beginning in 1981, Arlene, a partner and later 
Sharon marketed the Baby Sitter through a small but apparently successful firm, 
A-Plus Products. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Solly heard about a beauty product that was the rage in Israel, a 
gizmo with a revolving coil that pulled hair out by the root. After 
negotiations with the Israeli kibbutz that manufactured the device, Solly 
acquired the rights in the United States and Canada, along with some overseas 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Solly put the business in the hands of Arlene, Sharon and their 
associates. Only this time, the product was a giant success. 
</P>
<P>
The firm that came to be known as EPI turned Epilady into a hit by, among other 
things, persuading upscale department stores to sell the device at their 
high-traffic cosmetics counters rather than at their slower-going housewares 
sections. After the $90 Epilady developed an avid following at high-end stores, 
EPI brought out a cheaper model for mass merchants such as K mart and Target. 
</P>
<P>
Millions were spent on advertising, pitching the Epilady as an innovative 
product for the modern woman. As sales soared -- and even after they started 
falling over the past year -- glowing accounts of the high-flying sisters 
appeared on television and in magazines and newspapers, including The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were living in the United States between 1987 and 1990, you knew about 
Epilady," Faun said. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said, however, that the sisters "did not seek out publicity for their 
own self-aggrandizement" but that "the press was very interested" in them. 
</P>
<P>
"The public likes to know about women, particularly young women, who are 
successful in business," Browne said. The sisters "were willing to go along 
with it for the benefit of the company." 
</P>
<P>
In time, Epilady tripped over its hype and success. It didn't take long before 
most of the women who wanted an Epilady owned one. In fact, so did many other 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie, EPI's newly hired turnaround specialist, said the product should have 
been aimed principally at women who regularly wax their legs to remove hair. He 
explained that waxing involves the same kind of trade-off that an Epilady does 
-- you get smooth, silky legs in exchange for a painful removal process. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie said women who shave their legs typically are willing to put up with 
stubble but not the sort of pain that an Epilady inflicts on some users. Once 
lots of women who shaved their legs started buying Epilady, the product's 
popularity waned and returns mounted. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to Epilady's problems were concerns raised by health officials that the 
device could cause skin infections. 
</P>
<P>
Other firms have survived the demise of hot-selling items by coming out with 
new products. EPI tried to do the same, but it moved too late and came out with 
too many flops. The most promising items it sells today, Lurie said, are 
EpiSmile, a tooth whitener selling for $12 a tube, and EpiDent, a fancy 
electric toothbrush. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources said, the family resisted advice to adopt proper systems for 
keeping track of bills, inventory and cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Kline, the owner of a Los Angeles firm that buys merchandise for 
retailers, said EPI was "incredibly" disorganized. He said retailers he 
represented would return defective Epiladys and then would have to wait months 
to receive replacements or credit. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to call and call and call them, and then, finally, maybe the store 
would get a new one," Kline said. 
</P>
<P>
According to lawsuits, chicanery also may have played a pivotal role in EPI's 
fall. A suit by EPI's banks accuses the company and some of its principals of 
an array of abuses. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the banks' federal suit in Los Angeles charges that EPI invested 
and lost nearly $7 million on a Broadway play that bombed, "Meet Me in St. 
Louis." The investment, the suit says, was misrepresented as "prepaid 
advertising" in the company's financial statements and actually was intended 
for the personal benefit of Solly and Arlene Krok. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the suit maintains, $11 million that EPI officials said was 
allocated to distribute the firm's personal care products in Europe was in fact 
money put into Solly Krok's personal, and unsuccessful, "Quickwheel" venture. 
The Quickwheel has been described as "a skateboard for a car," a device 
enabling motorists with a flat tire to get to a service station without 
changing the bad tire themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the banks charge, Solly Krok and daughters Arlene Krok and Sharon Krok 
Feuer siphoned more than $2 million out of EPI to pay for their personal credit 
card bills and home mortgages and for "exorbitant" pay for Arlene and Sharon. 
</P>
<P>
According to a deposition in another case, Arlene and Sharon received bonuses 
of $1.1 million each from EPI in March, 1989. Three other executives, including 
Loren, each got $900,000 bonuses, according to the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
Browne, the Kroks' lawyer, characterized the banks' suit as an "outrageous" 
attempt to trump up a case against EPI principals to collect money that EPI 
itself can no longer pay because it is insolvent. The banks, he said, had "a 
straight-forward collection matter and turned it into a cause celebre." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the banks were fully aware of how EPI was using its money because 
they performed a thorough due diligence review of the firm's finances. 
</P>
<P>
A separate pending suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against EPI was filed 
last year by Patricia Jones, a 20% partner with the Kroks in A-Plus who 
contends that she was cast aside by the Kroks when EPI's business took off. 
Jones' suit maintains that EPI was an outgrowth of A-Plus and that she was 
fully involved in developing EPI's business. Consequently, she contends, she is 
entitled to 20% of EPI's past profits, which one of her lawyers suggests could 
be $40 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only after EPI got off to a rocket-like start that they forgot who our 
client was," said Victor Rosenblatt, one of Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Jones suit further alleges that Solly Krok withdrew millions in supposed 
royalties from EPI to "fraudulently avoid the payment" of U.S. taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Browne denied Jones' allegations and said her suit was motivated by "greed and 
jealousy." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another federal suit in New York against EPI was filed by Michael Ackerman, 
a sales agent in New York, who contends that EPI reneged on a commission 
agreement under which it may owe him as much as $1 million. Browne denied the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
EPI's future is being fought over in bankruptcy court. Lurie has reached a 
tentative agreement with a New York investment firm interested in financing EPI 
and eventually acquiring majority control, but the banks are challenging the 
deal as a possible fraud intended to benefit Solly Krok. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Kroks maintain that the company still has an attractive 
image, product line and distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
One part of the product line that could disappear, however, is the Epilady. The 
Israeli manufacturer has gone to court to take away EPI's marketing rights for 
the device. 
</P>
<P>
EPI, meanwhile, continues to wind down. Its Santa Monica headquarters on Ocean 
Park Boulevard is for sale, and employment, which peaked at 250 or more, now is 
around 25. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the family say the home the Kroks bought for $3.7 million last 
year in the flats of Beverly Hills, where Solly and his wife are now staying 
and where some of the sisters have lived, is about to go up for sale too. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Kroks pull EPI out of bankruptcy, there is still the matter of the 
family's tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
Faun, the former EPI executive, fears that the Krok sisters, after getting so 
much publicity when EPI was flying high, now will be viewed as failures. He 
says that the sisters followed the poor advice of their public relations 
department, which he faults for making them, not the company, the focus of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of that kind of PR campaign, yesterday's geniuses became today's 
jerks," Faun said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, "their setback is just a temporary one. These girls have just 
begun to live."

<P>
California Medi-Cal patients with high cholesterol now have easier access to a 
widely known but expensive cholesterol-lowering drug. 
</P>
<P>
Mevacor was added to the list of drugs that doctors can prescribe for Medi-Cal 
patients without prior authorization because its manufacturer, Merck &amp; Co., 
was willing to bargain with the state to lower the price. 
</P>
<P>
In a reversal of past practices, drug companies have recently started offering 
discounts to Medicaid, the federal/state health insurance program for the poor 
known in California as Medi-Cal. They say they are motivated to provide rich 
and poor with the same access to brand-name drugs. But they are also clearly 
acting under the threat that the federal government will make them bid for 
Medicaid work -- in effect, forcing discounting. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach may carry unintended risks for the companies. Some analysts 
say it may increase pressure for more drug discounts from public and private 
customers. By emphasizing discounts, these analysts say, the drug companies are 
also inviting probing questions about how drugs are priced in general. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the strategy seem to be deterring those in Congress who want to find 
ways to cut deeper into the burgeoning cost of Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) has introduced a bill that would force drug companies 
to bid for Medicaid business in an effort to help cut 1991 Medicaid expenses by 
$300 million. 
</P>
<P>
States, which share the cost of Medicaid, are also looking for ways to lower 
their prescription drug expenses, said Bob Hodgsen, an analyst with 
Boston-based Cowen &amp; Co. "There is a lot of momentum at the state level. 
There is a realization that cost containment is going to be applied to drugs," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts say, Medicaid discounts will not cost manufacturers much 
and will likely expand their Medicaid market. 
</P>
<P>
Rahway, N.J.-based Merck, the world's largest manufacturer, has signed about 20 
agreements with states since it said in May that its Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme 
unit would offer discounts for Medicaid prescriptions. The company said it will 
save Medicaid programs more than $20 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
California, which spent a half-billion dollars on Medi-Cal prescriptions last 
year, signed its third discount contract last week -- with Chicago-based G. D. 
Searle &amp; Co. Maryland has just signed an agreement with Kalamazoo, 
Mich-based Upjohn Co. that provides a standard $1.35 rebate on all Medicaid 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to discounts, companies are asking states to lift restrictions on 
all their drugs, potentially increasing their overall sales to Medicaid. About 
19 states have devised Medicaid formularies -- lists of drugs that may be 
prescribed without prior approval -- that tend to eliminate many expensive 
brand-name drugs. In order to prescribe a drug not on the list, a doctor 
generally has to provide written proof that only that brand will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
California did not agree to blanket acceptance of all Merck drugs, said Jim 
Parks, chief of the Medi-Cal drug-discount program. "We tell people up front 
that we will not agree to any drug sight-unseen," he said. California agreed 
that if Merck gets Food and Drug Administration approval of a new drug, the 
state will give it "some special consideration," expediting the process for 
adding it to the Medi-Cal formulary, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
In the Searle agreement, Medi-Cal agreed to add four Searle drugs to its 
formulary. They include Calan SR (180-milligram tablets) and Kerlone, both for 
the treatment of hypertension; Demulen, an oral contraceptive, and Cytotec, 
which is prescribed for patients who are at high risk for ulcers, particularly 
those taking aspirin-type medication for problems such as arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say their discount contracts contain provisions barring them 
from disclosing the amount of the discounts. Without the Searle discounts, a 
standard Calan prescription would cost $36.60, Cytotec $54.28, Kerlone $54.32 
(for 10-milligram tablets), and Demulen $17.23. The regular Mevacor price is 
close to $20 for a month's supply. 
</P>
<P>
The Medi-Cal formulary is based on five factors, including "essential need," 
effectiveness and cost, Parks said. Now that the state has the ability to 
negotiate drug prices, "cost will take a less important role," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland does not have a restricted list of Medicaid drugs, but that may 
change, said Nelson Sabatini, deputy director of the Maryland Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene. Upjohn has given notice that its rebate deal is off 
if the state develops a restrictive formulary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini says the discount programs are very positive, but the department 
believes that the state needs to establish other criteria that consider both 
the cost and therapeutic value of drugs to ensure that Medicaid patients are 
getting cost-effective care. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug companies are arguing that if we do (restrict some of their drugs), 
that the discount deal is off. We will continue to develop a therapeutic 
formulary, and if I find I save money that way, I will do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to force some price competition in this business," he added. 
"There is tremendous competition toward getting doctors to write prescriptions. 
But it is not competition that will benefit consumers." 
</P>
<P>
David F. Saks, a New York-based analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, says 
offering Medicaid discounts carries risk to drug companies, despite the 
possible advantage of increasing sales in a market that is now about 10% of the 
prescription drug business. For one, he said, "this issue has unearthed a whole 
question about how drugs are priced." Such questions may just increase pressure 
to discount, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Merck's share price dropped when it first announced its program because Wall 
Street perceived that the door had been opened to more discounting and thus a 
squeeze on profits, Saks said. 
</P>
<P>
Less attention had been given to the fact that drug companies have for years 
offered discounts to such large customers as the Department of Veterans Affairs 
and the Department of Defense -- and discounts to private customers in the form 
of lots of free samples and rebates based on volume. Saks said he doesn't 
believe that the drug companies' initiatives on Medicaid will stop 
government-mandated discounting. "It just adds more fuel to the fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Private health care concerns are also pressing for more specific discounts, 
said William R. Boyles, publisher of Health Market Survey, a Washington-based 
trade publication focusing on health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"HMOs and insurers all consider drugs third in line behind hospital and 
physician charges for cost containment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of discounting is unclear, but HMOs have obtained "extensive free 
samples, which amounts to a discount," Boyles said. Drug companies have tried 
to get by with so-called value-added items such as free pens, pads and 
seminars, he said. But more and more, HMOs are bringing the discussion back to 
bottom-line prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A relatively small percentage of HMOs have their own pharmacies, but those that 
do "consider discounts the only reason to talk to a pharmaceuticals firm . . . 
I'm pleased to see the turn of events on Medicaid," Boyles said. "Drug 
companies have overcharged for years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FLEXIBLE PRICE OF DRUGS 
</P>
<P>
The pricing of drugs is a mystery to people outside the industry. Drug 
manufacturers acknowlege providing discounts to certain large customers. But 
many discount contracts contain clauses prohibiting disclosure of the terms.

Engine Cleaner Inventors Sue Automotive Firm: Two holders of a patent for an 
internal combustion engine scrubber sued Parker Automotive Corp. of Costa Mesa 
on grounds that Parker obtained a patent on a similar product after receiving 
an exclusive license to make their scrubber. 
</P>
<P>
In their federal lawsuit, Maurice Carmichael and Janis Binatena asserted that 
in 1987 they gave Parker the right to manufacture and sell the scrubber in 
return for royalties -- which were never paid. A condition of the agreement was 
that all modifications on the scrubber would be the property of the patent 
holders, the suit says. (Case No. 90-4920. Filed Sept. 13, 1990)

Few Mid-Sized Firms Plan Capital Spending Cuts: Three-quarters of mid-sized 
American manufacturers plan to spend as much or more on plant and equipment in 
1991 as they did this year, the New York consulting firm Grant Thornton said. 
Only one in five manufacturers with annual sales of $10 million to $200 million 
plans to cut capital spending, Thornton said.

Asahi Buying Stake in Australian Brewery: Japan's Asahi Breweries will pay $770 
million for a 19.9% stake in Australia's largest company, Elders IXL, the maker 
of Foster's beer. The linkup between Japan's second-largest brewery and Elders, 
the world's No. 4 beer maker, paves the way for an Asian powerhouse in the 
brewery business. Elders Chairman John Elliott agreed to sell 446.6 million 
Elders shares held by his Harlin Holdings Ltd. and relinquish majority control 
of the company in order to reduce a $1.6-billion debt.

MARKET BEAT: INSIDER BUYING RUSH IS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damn the bears, full speed ahead! 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty much the motto of a lot of corporate insiders today, at least 
where their stocks are concerned. While the market continues to sink, 
executives and directors are in there avidly buying their own companies' stocks 
for their personal portfolios. They apparently think they're getting great 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
The Insiders newsletter of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., tracks open-market insider 
transactions via the officers' required filings with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Editor Norman Fosback says a "flash" index of insider 
maneuvers shows 77% of their stock transactions over the past 30 days have been 
purchases, and only 23% have been sales. 
</P>
<P>
The buying spree appears to be accelerating: A reading over the last 20 days 
alone shows 84% purchases, Fosback says. That's getting close to the 
record-high 89% flash index reading recorded immediately after the October 1987 
market crash, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the insiders have had a pretty good sense of when to buy and sell 
their own stocks. That's what you'd expect, given that they ought to know best 
how prospects look for their companies. But Fosback notes that insiders aren't 
infallible, and they're often early. They were wildly bullish all during the 
market plunge of 1974, not just at the bottom. And they bought heavily early in 
1982, well before the market bottomed that August. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, buying by insiders in one industry group -- banking -- has been 
extremely strong for the past year, even as the stocks have sunk ever lower 
each month, Fosback notes. The banking industry has an "Insider Rating" of 6.9, 
highest of all industry groups on Fosback's 1-to-10 rating scale, with 10 being 
rampant insider bullishness. The system is based on a weighting of insider 
purchases versus sales over the last year, and also factors in the importance 
of the executives involved, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never noticed such concerted buying in any one industry like this," he 
says of the banks, also noting that S&amp;L executives too have been major 
buyers of their own shares. Yet the bank and S&amp;L stocks' dismal performance 
in the face of that buying has been "discouraging," Fosback says. It suggests 
that the insiders have just been plain wrong, in this case, to be so 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the complexity of the banking and S&amp;L industries is such that the 
insiders don't understand the real value of their stocks anymore," Fosback 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders at CalFed, parent of California Federal Bank, proved to be good timers 
early in 1984, when they bought shortly before the stock tripled. Now they're 
buying heavily again. 
</P>
<P>
Seven CalFed officers and directors boosted their holdings substantially in 
late July and early August. They included Chairman Jerry St. Dennis, who bought 
5,000 shares on July 31 for $10.375 apiece, raising his total to 17,224 shares. 
At that point, the stock was already off 64% from its 1989 peak of $28.50. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, CalFed stock closed at $6.875, down $1.125 for the day, as 
investors continued to mercilessly sell financial stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders at other finance and real estate firms also have bought into their 
slumping shares, to little avail so far: 
</P>
<P>
* At Security Pacific Corp., Vice Chairman David Lovejoy bought 5,000 shares on 
Aug. 24 at $26.375 apiece, raising his stake to 36,912 shares. And Nicholas 
Binkley, president of the company's Financial Services System unit, added 1,400 
shares to his holdings on Aug. 29 at $27.625 each. The stock now is at $26. 
</P>
<P>
* At Del Webb Corp., a major developer of retirement communities in the West, 
Controller John A. Spencer picked up 2,000 Webb shares on Aug. 16 for $6.375 
each. He bought 2,000 more shortly afterward, for $5 each. The stock now is at 
$6.25. It was as high as $15.75 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock price got to the point of being ridiculous," Spencer says. The real 
estate market's short-term slide notwithstanding, he says, "We're extremely 
confident about our company." 
</P>
<P>
It may well turn out that the insiders have been right to be so bullish. A few 
years from now, assuming that the banking and real estate industries recover, 
those stocks could be double or triple where they are today. 
</P>
<P>
But as in the past, it also may be that insiders are too early, across the 
board. And in the worst case, they may be viewing their businesses less with 
special insight than with a hopefulness based on pure emotion instead of fact. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: The market may have been preordained to plunge this year, according to 
some chart work done by Ralph Acampora, technical analyst at Prudential-Bache 
Securities. He notes that the Dow Jones industrial average reached major 
bottoms every four years consistently from 1962 to 1986. The years 1974 and 
1982 provided the most memorable bottoms in that sequence of four-year cycles. 
You have to look at the 1987 crash as an aberration to entirely buy this cycle, 
but it's interesting anyway. . . . With the departure of bullish market 
strategist John Connolly, Dean Witter Reynolds has cut its recommended 
"balanced account" portfolio weighting to 60% stocks, from 70%. The firm raised 
the bond weighting to 30% from 20% and kept cash at 10%.

SMALL-STOCK INDEXERS STILL WAITING FOR SHIP TO COME IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investing with Rex Sinquefield and David Booth is a form of existentialism: A 
stock exists, therefore they own it. 
</P>
<P>
Their strategy also has been a form of masochism for seven years running, 
because the stocks that they buy are those of small companies -- which have 
painfully lagged the broad market since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Sinquefield and Booth's $5-billion investment firm, Santa Monica-based 
Dimensional Fund Advisors, is the nation's largest index investor in small 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
They do no original research, no projections of earnings trends or other 
fundamentals. They don't care what the companies produce. Shares of 3,200 small 
U.S. companies and 2,800 small foreign companies sit in their portfolio -- just 
because. 
</P>
<P>
Index investing, which rose to prominence in the 1980s, is the antithesis of 
active stock picking. Instead of trying to outperform the market by picking the 
best stocks, indexers seek to match the market by owning all of the stocks that 
make up key market indexes or subgroups. 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds like joining 'em because you can't beat 'em, that's exactly what 
it is. Index investors believe in an efficient market. Therefore, it's 
impossible for a money manager to beat the market over the long term, indexers 
argue. Better just buy the whole market. 
</P>
<P>
When the witch in "The Wizard of Oz" wrote "Surrender Dorothy!" in the sky over 
the Emerald City, it might as well have been these guys taunting the money 
managers who try to make a living picking stocks. Says Booth: "Nobody is out 
pushing the index concept like we do. We actually believe this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Investors associate index investing mostly with the big stocks that make up the 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. Booth and Sinquefield, both schooled at the 
University of Chicago and both true believers in that institution's free-market 
philosophies, founded DFA in 1981 to extend indexing to small stocks. 
</P>
<P>
It was, Booth admits, "a salesman's dream" of an idea. Big investors, he says, 
"agreed they should have it (an indexed small-stock portfolio), but they didn't 
have it" because no one offered it. By the end of 1981, DFA had $234 million 
under management. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, DFA bought only the smallest 20% of the stocks on the New 
York Stock Exchange, measured by market capitalization (stock price times 
number of shares outstanding). In 1984, the firm began adding over-the-counter 
stocks. In 1985, with business booming, Booth and Sinquefield moved DFA to 
Santa Monica from Chicago, for the quality of life. Their Ocean Avenue offices 
now are home to 40 staffers. A London office has a staff of 14. 
</P>
<P>
Behind DFA's success in attracting money is a basic tenet long respected on 
Wall Street: the idea that small-company stocks outperform big stocks over the 
long term. No one can say exactly why the so-called small-stock effect occurs. 
The simplest theory is that, because small companies by nature grow faster than 
big companies, their investors are better rewarded. For whatever reason, it 
works: 
</P>
<P>
* In the 50-year period ended in 1989, the average annualized return of small 
stocks was 14.1%, versus 11.8% for the blue-chip stocks in the S&amp;P 500, DFA 
calculates. 
</P>
<P>
* Over the past 20 years, small stocks also did better, though not by as much: 
11.8% versus 11.6% for the S&amp;P. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1980s, the trend reversed itself. In the five years ended in 1989, 
the S&amp;P sharply outperformed small-stock indexes, 20.4% to 12.4%, 
annualized. Every year since 1984, investors have kept telling themselves that 
it's only a matter of time before small stocks return to the fore. They're 
still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong? Sinquefield and Booth have no concrete answer. "But on some 
level, it has to be earnings-related," Sinquefield says. One argument is that 
big companies operated more efficiently than small companies in the 1980s 
because of the big firms' drastic restructurings. Takeover mania also helped 
big stocks. 
</P>
<P>
A few years of under-performance, however, can't erase the long-term proof of 
small stocks' better returns, DFA says. "The logic is unassailable," Booth 
says. Yet, he admits, "people are frustrated because we've done so poorly." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, most of DFA's major clients -- names like Blue Cross of California, 
the City of Seattle and British Aerospace -- have stayed put. Why? "Well, we 
think small-cap stocks will turn around someday," says Georganne Perkins, an 
analyst in the Stanford University treasurer's office. Stanford, which has been 
with DFA since 1984, has $32 million invested with it. 
</P>
<P>
A strong argument for DFA's approach is that foreign small stocks continued to 
outperform their big-stock rivals in the late '80s, even though U.S. small 
stocks lagged. DFA began investing overseas in 1986, and its expertise with 
those small stocks has attracted U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps equally important is the fact that DFA's clients know that, despite the 
U.S. portfolio's dismal showing, DFA knows the tricks of managing a small-stock 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
That's no small feat. By their nature, small stocks are difficult to buy and 
sell because there are few shares outstanding. DFA owns stakes of 5% or more in 
about 500 of the 3,200 U.S. companies in its portfolio. A big investor who 
fails to move nimbly and quietly can send a small stock's price way up when 
trying to buy and way down when trying to sell -- defeating the paramount goal 
of getting the most efficient price. 
</P>
<P>
DFA has a "buy" list of small stocks that it wants to add to its already huge 
universe. Rather than throw money at the stocks, it takes a patient approach, 
Booth says -- cultivating relationships with brokers, spreading buy orders 
among 40 or 50 brokers nationwide and waiting for "motivated" sellers to 
surface. Transactions involve plenty of haggling, and DFA engages in undercover 
work to avoid transactions in which would-be sellers know something it doesn't 
-- such as an upcoming event that might crush the stock. 
</P>
<P>
"They've shown they're very adept at trading," says DeWitt Bowman, chief 
investment officer for the California Public Employees Retirement System, which 
has $600 million invested with DFA. 
</P>
<P>
The same kinds of patient strategies apply when DFA sells. And the firm sells 
only when a small stock outgrows the "small" definition, which now ranges from 
$140 million to $400 million in market capitalization, depending on the DFA 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the ironies of DFA's index approach: A company doesn't exit DFA's 
portfolio by going bankrupt, but by becoming so successful that its stock hits 
the big leagues. Do well, and you're out. 
</P>
<P>
That may make it sound as if DFA is investing backwards. And partly because 
their approach isn't easy to swallow at all times, DFA doesn't seek out small 
investors. The minimum investment it accepts is $50,000, and individual clients 
can invest with DFA only through certain financial planners. 
</P>
<P>
While they wait for small stocks to return to their historical performance, 
Sinquefield and Booth have another concern to contemplate: Whether index 
investing might be a trend whose time has passed, after booming in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Could the '90s belong to the stock picker rather than the market buyer? You'll 
never get Sinquefield and Booth to believe that anyone can be smarter than the 
market over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Asks Sinquefield rhetorically: "What is it that's changed in the 1990s that 
suggests markets won't work anymore?" If you need further proof of market 
logic, he says, just ask the Soviet Union's communists -- who have decided to 
junk the alternative after 73 years of failed results. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KEEPING THE FAITH IN SMALL STOCKS -- BUT FOR HOW LONG? 
</P>
<P>
Measured over 50 years, small stocks have produced far better returns than big 
stocks -- in the United States and abroad. But the past 10 years have seen U.S. 
small stocks lag badly. Their fans are betting that will change in the 1990s.

MERCHANDISING'S BIG LEAGUERS; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS SPECIALTIES' CAPS HAVE MADE FANS WORLDWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By James S. Granelli, Times staff writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Sports Specialties Corp. is going through some pretty heady times as it rides 
the wave of international demand for American sports and sports products. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine company makes the popular Pro brand cap, authentic headgear that 
the pros wear. It holds licenses from all the major professional sports leagues 
and college associations, as well as the International Baseball Assn., which 
covers about 80 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The international link has become a major factor in the private firm's 
continued growth. Four years ago, the company was filling occasional orders 
from fans in foreign countries. Today it gets more than 10% of its $40 million 
in annual revenue from overseas sales. By the time the 1992 Olympic Games roll 
around, the firm expects to be generating 20% of its revenue in foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports Specialties, founded in 1928 in Chicago by David Warsaw, introduced the 
nation to sports merchandising. Warsaw hawked a variety of sports souvenirs in 
Wrigley Field and Soldier Field. In the 1950s and '60s, the firm sold the 
popular spring-neck bobble-head dolls out of the Los Angeles Rams novelty shop. 
</P>
<P>
 As his two sons, James and Robert, started to take roles in the company, 
Warsaw sold the novelties operations to concentrate on producing high-end caps. 
The firm now makes caps in three foreign plants and in Winslow, Ariz., using 
wool, corduroy, cotton twill, polypropylene and, catering to the fashion set, 
leather. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warsaws sold their firm to MacGregor Sporting Goods in 1986, but after an 
acrimonious year with the New Jersey company, they engineered the sale of their 
division to a New York investment firm. The family retained a minority interest 
in the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman, Robert A. Warsaw, 41, oversees production and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 James H. Warsaw, the company's 42-year-old president, heads up the company's 
marketing efforts. He recently spoke with Times staff writer James S. Granelli 
about the company's effort to cash in on foreign demand for Pro caps. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How necessary are international sales to your business? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it's extremely important for our company's presence to grow and 
flourish overseas. We are committed to being the leader in authentic, 
high-quality caps in world professional sports as we are in American 
professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How did you get interested in the overseas market? 
</P>
<P>
A. It goes back many years. When the O'Malleys (team owners) took the Dodgers 
in the late '50s and early '60s to Japan every year, my father would make that 
trip too. And later Sandy Koufax and Joe DiMaggio went down to Mexico on 
separate trips with American baseball organizations and became American heros. 
They were baseball heroes overseas. So that was kind of inbred in me growing up 
25 to 30 years ago. However, I saw it as a definite asset from a business 
perspective at the American Bowl three years ago, when the Denver Broncos and 
the Los Angeles Rams played in London. More than 85,000 people in Wembley 
Stadium watched, and less than maybe 10% of the people attending fully 
understood what was going on. But they were totally involved in the hoopla of 
the bands, the cheerleaders and the big blokes, as they called them, hitting 
each other through the line. And finally, of course, I saw the merchandise 
being sold successfully, and the people getting enjoyment out of that. I felt 
that that was definitely a market to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Did you start in England? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Then later the NFL had games in Japan, and last year the (San 
Francisco) 49ers and the Rams played an exciting game in the Tokyo Dome. And 
this year we're marketing our NFL goods in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Long before you went to London, though, you had been filling small, personal 
orders for people around the world. Didn't that indicate that there was a 
broader market for you? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, what has happened is that the satellite generation and the global 
economy have created a worldwide awareness of American sports. And this is not 
just on the field; it's off the field. It's the mannerisms; it's the fashion; 
it's the look; it's the lifestyle that is America. That creates an opportunity 
for this company to be successful overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How did you learn about foreign markets? 
</P>
<P>
A. My brother and I got our training from our father, who started importing 
from Japan in 1936. He brought in the bobble-head dolls, the baseball gloves, 
the bats, the balls, the T-shirts, the whole line of American sports souvenir 
products and merchandise that this company pioneered. When we graduated 
college, he said it was time for his Ph.D. program, and that was to live 
overseas -- my brother in Taiwan and myself in Hong Kong -- for several years 
in the early 1970s. What we learned about developing foreign markets there has 
been very, very instrumental in our initial success in marketing overseas in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But foreign trade wasn't the intent of this "doctorate" program, was it? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. It was learning about the factories, the people, the business. The other 
thing that we learned then, that we feel is paramount now in our relations with 
other countries, is that their habits, their traditions, their mores, their 
customs are very important to respect and honor in our business relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Once you decided to put that experience to work in foreign trade three years 
ago, what steps did you take to develop sales overseas? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, we developed it through our relationships with the (professional) 
leagues, simultaneously with the inquiries we were getting by fax, by 
telephone, by mail from overseas. I'd say we now average between 50 and 100 
faxes a week, inquiries from all over the world. We've developed a very 
exciting market in Australia, partially because of TV exposure of the major 
special events in the United States, like (the) Super Bowl and World Series. 
This fuels excitement, enthusiasm, American lifestyle, American sports 
overseas. That is what we are getting in these faxes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In developing your international strategy, did you hire consultants or 
anyone else to help or did you believe you had enough experience to sell 
overseas? 
</P>
<P>
A. Basically, the international experience has to be well coordinated with the 
leagues and the leagues' consultants and the leagues' experience. Their people 
sort of paved the way for a smooth overseas distribution of licensed products, 
including Sports Specialties caps. For example, we made a decision that we were 
not going to take our own people and our own warehouses and tell the people in 
Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy or Spain how to do business with their own 
people. However, with the demand that's been created with our advertising . . . 
and our point of purchase materials, we offered sales technique assistance that 
has been very beneficial. So as a team, we feel we could generate maximum 
results in local foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Did you have to tailor either your caps or your marketing strategy for any 
particular markets or for overseas in general? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, it's interesting. Last year, for example, we met with representatives 
in baseball from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania. Dealing with 
their needs first had some political constraints. A year later, those problems 
have become a lot less severe with the opening up of the Eastern Bloc 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So you had structural adjustments to make, but the caps -- and the American 
sports culture that fosters their appeal -- sell themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. One of the very important things that appeal to international interest 
and Sport Specialties is the International Baseball Assn.'s success in 
developing Olympic medal sport status for baseball, starting with the Barcelona 
games in 1992. That has fueled interest all over the world. Nigeria and 
Ethiopia started teams recently. Romania, Bulgaria and other Soviet bloc 
nations that never had teams before are being helped by the Olympic movement in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you supplying caps to IBA teams? 
</P>
<P>
A. We've developed a sponsorship with the IBA about two years ago, and we have 
developed national team caps for 35 to 40 countries right now. We'll be in the 
process next year of developing the balance of IBA's membership, which is 
almost 80 countries. The other interesting thing to look at in this whole 
marketing segment is the cultural exchanges of professional sports teams and 
athletes. You have Yugoslavs like Vlade Divac, for instance, playing with the 
Lakers. Playing for professional sports teams here provides a tremendous 
impetus and demand in their native countries for U.S.-related sports products, 
including our caps, and team-identified merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What caps are selling overseas? 
</P>
<P>
A. The new polypropylene hats that we introduced a year ago are more accepted 
in Europe than they are in the United States. For example, the Pro workout 
polypropylene cap has very unique properties that help to keep you cool when 
it's hot, warm when it's cold and dry when it's wet. Professional football 
players loved it last year in training camp because as much as they'd sweat it 
would dry off quickly. In conveying this to the American consumer, we had a 
more difficult time than we did overseas. It's been very well accepted 
overseas, and we don't have to mention the properties of the fabrics and how 
they work. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What merchandise hasn't worked overseas? 
</P>
<P>
A. We haven't been as successful in Europe with our cotton twills, for example, 
probably because of the cold winters. We've been more successful in the heavy 
caps: the corduroys, the wools, the polypropylene. The cotton twill fabric is 
not as readily accepted as it is here. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Have you found any other differences in marketing Pro caps in foreign 
countries? 
</P>
<P>
A. This is very interesting. What we found out was that the most important 
factor was color. We're selling colors. We're in the fashion business, and our 
overseas marketing is ahead of our domestic marketing in that. It's the fashion 
element. It's the whole understanding that you don't have to be a fan of this 
team to wear the cap because this is matching with an outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Have you had to make any major tactical or marketing adjustments? 
</P>
<P>
A. We've been very successful in promoting the authenticity of our caps. But we 
ran into a problem in some European and Scandinavian countries. Some countries 
did not want us to use their native tongue. They said this would be great in 
English and would promote the authenticity of the American sports. So where we 
had thought we would translate an American ad into a foreign language, we found 
it would be more effective, because of the cultural message we're trying to 
convey, if we did it in English, which is often spoken by Europeans anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You also make and sell foreign team and university caps. Have you found 
anything different in selling those caps? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. We make the official team caps for various countries, and we're just 
begining to market those overseas. The names of all the teams, except for one, 
are in English. The only team that wanted its name in the native language is 
Italy. They wanted 'Italia' on their blue and white caps. I said to the head of 
the team, 'Aren't Italy's colors different from blue and white?' He said, 
'Yeah, but we saw the Dodgers.' They took the blue and white. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much time and money did you invest before you began to see any returns 
from overseas sales? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, ironically, the people were always there prior to a formal structure 
of our system. And this was because we wanted to have our structure carefully 
set before we went out and marketed both our products and our name -- our brand 
name and our family name -- overseas. So we had the ducks in the pond long 
before we were swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Wasn't there a financial drain in doing this? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, because the financing was there, and we had monitored the market looking 
for the right time to enter. And the right timing came in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where did you go for financing? 
</P>
<P>
A. We financed from existing cash flow in the company. One of the strengths of 
this company over the years has been cash flow. And once again, it came to our 
very good assistance in developing this market. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So you hit a market ripe for your caps. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. And there was another timing factor. The leagues themselves became more 
aware of the demands of the international markets. For example, Major League 
Baseball just formed a partnership called Major League Baseball International 
Partners with NBC's London-based affiliate.

ANN CONWAY: HILTON A SAFE HARBOR FOR COMMITTEE

Finally, a hotel they can call home. In Orange County, a social tribe without a 
ballroom is like a socialite without a diamond -- she can paint the town 
without it, but it's a little harder to shine. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the new Waterfront Hilton in Huntington Beach, the 
Huntington Harbour Philharmonic Committee -- the single largest annual 
contributor to the Orange County Philharmonic Society -- can kick up its heels 
without leaving home, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-room resort, just a swim away from Huntington Harbour, boasts not only 
an elegant ballroom but also a pool area with a surf-and-sand view, something 
no other major Orange County hotel can claim. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, about 300 members of the Huntington Harbour committee 
schmoozed around the undulating pool, sipped something cool, and dug into a 
generous array of appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
Guests were hard-put to believe that they were in Huntington Beach. The hotel's 
structures were on either side and straight ahead: the deep-blue ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "This doesn't feel like Huntington. You can't see any oil wells!" 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but an oil tanker lurked on the horizon, giving Leonard Catalano -- the 
hotel's catering manager -- fits. "What can you do?" he asked, rolling his 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
If you're Catalano, you distract guests with the Pandemonium Steel Band, a duet 
of dolphin ice sculptures, and enough floral exotica to camouflage the Exxon 
Valdez, now called the Exxon Mediterannean. You pass tulips of wine and bubbly 
on silver trays. And finally, you bid guests into the ballroom for dancing and 
a repast that includes warm duck-breast salad, lamb chop, grilled tuna, and 
fruit tarts drizzled with champagne sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Guests included Philharmonic board president Robert Searles and Huntington 
Harbour Committee Chairwoman Doris Willis, attending with her husband, Dr. 
Burton Willis. (Holiday entertaining tip: the committee's annual Cruise of 
Lights -- open-to-the-public boat tours of Huntington Harbour to view homes 
decorated with lights -- is set for Dec. 13 through Dec. 21. Proceeds to the 
Philharmonic Society are expected to exceed $140,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Also on the party scene: Erich Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society; Philharmonic board member Bobbitt Williams with her 
husband, Bill; Joanne and Howard Fernbach; Joyce and Mark Weiss; Sherry and 
Dale Skerik and Isabel and Paul Greenwald. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, members of the Little Mermaid Guild -- also a Huntington 
Beach-based group -- of Children's Hospital of Orange County helped launch the 
new hotel. After a pool-side reception, guests filed into the ballroom for 
dinner, an auction conducted by Lyle Waggoner and a surprise performance by 
singer-songwriter (the "Rocky" theme) Carol Conners. 
</P>
<P>
Another highlight for guests: the chance to gaze upon posters up for auction 
that showcased the touching "Secrets" painting created by Laguna Beach artist 
Ivan Anderson. Each "Secrets" poster -- an impressionistic portrayal of a boy 
and girl whispering as they walk down a path -- displayed the signatures of 
celebrities. The party was themed "Celebration for Children." Among guests: 
gala co-chairwomen Lori Bobo and Jackie Teichmann, Joyce Graham, Barbara Alter, 
Joyce Berneart, Ginny Bowman, Sarah Faber, Ellen Pook, Lotus Williams and Kathy 
Brandt, president of the Little Mermaid Guild. 
</P>
<P>
Super scoops: Vice President Dan Quayle will appear at a $1,000-per-person 
fund-raiser for the local and statewide chapters of the GOP on Sept. 25 at the 
home of John and Donna Crean of Santa Ana Heights. (Imagine the Secret Service 
trying to safeguard the jillion nooks and crannies of the luxurious Crean 
"hotel" -- more than 35,000 square feet of Tara-esque grandeur that, among 
other things eye-popping, features a dance studio, screening room, and a 
private apartment for the owners. . . . Talk about a social coup. The Center 
Dance Alliance, a support group of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
has landed the post-performance party of 1990. On Sept. 30, the group will 
stage a "Stars and Stripes Gala" at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. Up for 
gawking: members of the super-hot New York City Ballet, including its 
Adonis-like master-in-chief, the Danish-born Peter Martins (There is nothing 
like a Dane). Guests at the $125-per-person, black-tie preferred event -- which 
is open to the public -- will enjoy cocktails at 6 p.m. (the party follows the 
company's final matinee at the Center) and dinner at 7 p.m. The New York City 
Ballet appears at the Center from Sept. 25 through 30. During its engagement 
the company will perform the West Coast premiere of a work by Martins entitled 
"Ecstatic Orange." How appropriate. . . . The Viba Guild of Opera Pacific is 
staging a bus trip to Los Angeles on Oct. 7 to see the opera "Nixon in China" 
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center. (John Taylor, 
the new director of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, 
saw the show in New York. But he may decide to take in the L.A. production 
soon, says library spokesman Kevin Cartwright, who saw the production last week 
and claimed it interesting and confusing. Personally, I got a kick out of 
watching Pat Nixon arrive in China in those '60s-style boots we all wore. 
Remember?). . . .

<P>
MEDICINE: AN ARCADIA MAN IS ADDRESSING THE PAIN AND TRAUMA OF HIS 
HARD-TO-DIAGNOSE KIDNEY DISEASE BY RAISING FUNDS FOR KIDNEY REASEARCH AND A NEW 
PROFESSORSHIP AT USC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
David Thornton visited 26 doctors before physicians at USC Medical Center 
diagnosed his rare kidney disease. He was told he might have intestinal cancer, 
blood clots in his lungs or lupus before USC surgeons removed one kidney and 
operated on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say patients undergoing that kind of trauma frequently try to forget 
their disease -- or deny it -- but Thornton, 24, responded by starting a 
foundation to raise $2.5 million for kidney research. He wants to endow a 
research suite and a professorship in a new tower at USC's Kenneth Norris Jr. 
Comprehensive Cancer Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mainly because of my pain," Thornton said recently in the Pasadena office 
he opened in July. "When I went to all those different places for answers, the 
answers weren't there. I want to do what I can to make sure other people don't 
have to go through what I went through. And it might be a way to find something 
to keep me alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not received a death sentence. I have just been given a new outlook. I 
want to do what I can to help others today because I don't know if I'll be in 
bed with pain all day tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The Thornton Kidney Research Foundation will hold a free kick-off reception at 
4 p.m. Wednesday, in the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the expected 130 guests will be family and old friends, but USC 
president Dr. James H. Zumberge and members of the school's board of directors 
will also attend. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton, who lives in Arcadia, is confident this group will help him reach his 
goal. "These men are well-known in the community," he said. "They will get the 
information out about what the foundation is doing. The guests are not just my 
family and friends. It's also the hierarchy of USC." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton began working on the foundation in January after sounding out his 
physicians on his plans. He used his savings and a grant from another 
foundation for expenses and relied on the USC Comprehensive Cancer Center 
development office for advice on direct mail, solicitation of major gifts and 
other matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people can write a check or make a commitment over five years," said 
Bill Watson, director of development for the Comprehensive Cancer Center. "But 
for someone to put in the time and energy that he has is very unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some techniques a professional development officer would need to 
use," Watson said, "whereas the sincerity David represents is obvious. I've 
seen how people react to him. To be successful is to really understand your 
product and what you're asking a donor to give toward, and he's obviously lived 
through what he's representing." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jeffry Huffman, the associate professor of urology at the USC School of 
Medicine who is Thornton's physician, said he and other doctors were impressed 
by Thornton's plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he had a lot of resources as far as family and as far as knowing a lot 
of people willing to support a foundation," Huffman said. "When he had surgery, 
he had 20 to 30 family members waiting for him after the operation. You could 
tell there was a lot of support." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton's father, Franklin, is a Pasadena architect, and his mother, Patricia, 
directs a preschool and middle-school in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will succeed," Huffman said. "Everything I've seen is very 
positive. His resources are his internal drive and his hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman met Thornton in 1988 when he was a senior speech communication major at 
Cal State Long Beach. It was a year after his pain had begun and after Thornton 
had been through a long trail of other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman examined him with a 3-millimeter endoscope that he had helped develop. 
He discovered the source of Thornton's internal bleeding was an abnormal blood 
vessel and learned that Thornton's condition, a disease associated with pain 
and bleeding from the kidneys, was so rare that it "doesn't fit in the normal 
category of disease entities." 
</P>
<P>
"He was the only one who saw the abnormal bleeding from the blood vessel in the 
kidney," Thornton said, "and he was well known for his procedures in looking 
for that condition. I just felt comfortable with him. He was like the 
quarterback. He took control of the situation and saw the whole picture. Before 
that I was going to specialists for each area of my body." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said Thornton's disease most closely resembles angio dysplasia or 
hematuria loin pain syndrome, "but we have been unable to really prove it 
because he tends to bleed a lot from other organs such as his lungs or 
gastrointestinal tract." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said surgeons first removed part of the left kidney, which was causing 
most of the bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
"He was virtually normal on the left side for about a year before the pain 
resumed and it was necessary to remove the rest of that kidney," the physician 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first surgery he did well and was off medications and went back to 
work and school for four to six months," Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton was graduated from college in 1988 and worked as a vice president for 
an Orange County firm before resigning when he started having pain on the right 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"So we removed the nerve supply to the right kidney to eliminate the sensation 
of pain," Huffman said. "He was healthy for about a year but now he's starting 
to have some discomfort on that side." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton, who spent 70 days in the hospital during a two-year stretch, will 
soon be readmitted to the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center so doctors can 
monitor his reaction to new pain medication. Doctors will watch him carefully 
because he reacted to medications twice with cardiac arrhythmias and had to be 
resuscitated. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said that although medical literature is limited, Thornton's condition 
does not appear fatal. "What I've told him all along is that I don't expect 
this to be a life-threatening problem," he said. "It is not a cancer. It will 
not metastasize. He is able to carry out a fairly normal daily routine. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it is a major problem. There is a lot of uncertainty and that tends 
to affect your mind set. There is the possibility that we will have to move his 
kidney to another spot, put him on dialysis or do a transplant from someone 
else somewhere down the line. But I tend to be optimistic about his prognosis." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Thornton appears healthy. The former lifeguard retains good coloring 
and, at 6-foot-1 and 165 pounds, looks as if he could still maneuver through 
hundreds of feet of waves to rescue a swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'You look well and you look happy,' " he said. "I think that's a 
great plus. I do not want to come across as a sick person who wants sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
But appearances are deceiving, Thornton said. Fatigue prevents him from working 
more than six hours a day, and he winced during a recent interview, recalling 
the pain that awakened him the previous morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like a knife moving inside the organ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton is determined that the pain not prevent him from orchestrating a 
money-raising campaign rarely pursued by someone his age. 
</P>
<P>
In his office, he displays a signed picture of George Bush and a large American 
flag. His large, efficiently organized wood desk holds only a personal computer 
and several neatly stacked piles of paper. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton appears all business in neatly trimmed hair, a bold-patterned tie and 
a crisply pressed summer suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking on my condition as fatal," he said. "If I were looking on it 
that way, I don't think I'd be doing this. I think I'd be depressed somewhere. 
If it were so close, I'd be giving into it. And I'm not going to give in. I'm 
going to fight it and remain positive."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the parlor below the deck of her houseboat docked on the Potomac, a youngish 
woman -- blond and dressed in white -- recounts the dream and nightmare of her 
search for her long-hidden legend-filled past. 
</P>
<P>
Among the framed old photographs decorating the wood-paneled room, there is 
only one that really matters to Jett Williams: a black-and-white picture of a 
handsome young man in a cowboy hat with a dreamy expression on his face. 
</P>
<P>
It is no ordinary face, no ordinary family photograph. The man is famous, an 
immortal icon of popular culture. Pictures just like this belong to his fans 
all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
But this 37-year-old married woman, who has embarked on a show business career 
of her own, is more than an overzealous fan. The man in the photograph is the 
object of a 15-year obsession that has taken her down a long, lonesome road of 
legal battles and family feuds that have resulted in a complete transformation 
of her identity. 
</P>
<P>
He is the legendary country singer-songwriter Hank Williams. And she -- unaware 
of it until she was 21 -- is his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams is more than just a singer and composer; he can be credited, with 
the equally legendary Roy Acuff, of being a founder of country music. His songs 
emphasize the poetic beauty of romantic misery. Such Williams classics as "Your 
Cheatin' Heart" and "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" formed the basic vocabulary 
of the country repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Jett Williams -- adopted at age 3 -- and her struggle to establish 
her identity as her father's daughter is a tale of more pathos, more twists and 
turns, than a country ballad. 
</P>
<P>
It is a story that has the ingredients of a Southern Gothic novel: a baby whose 
father dies five days before she is born and whose mother abandoned her; 
betrayal by relatives who placed her for adoption; a fight over an inheritance; 
the refusal of the legitimate son to recognize his illegitimate sibling; 
persistence in the face of great odds; a fortuitous discovery of a hidden 
document; and, for good measure, a love affair with and eventual marriage to 
the lawyer who helped right the wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond and above all the maneuverings and scheming is the transcendent theme of 
the love of a daughter for a father she would never know and her belief in his 
love for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that I've had a guardian angel -- I really, really do. And I've 
implied that I think my father is my guardian angel, and that he's looking 
down," Williams says in her Alabama accent. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of ghostwriter Pamela Thomas, Williams has written about her life 
in "Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My Baby" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich). The book's 
publication date is today, the birthday of Hank Williams Sr. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one thing Jett Williams has learned from her decision to get to the 
bottom of the truth about her past, it is that her efforts to establish herself 
as who she really is -- Hank Williams' daughter -- have been met with less than 
sentimental appreciation by many people, including relatives in her real and 
adoptive families. 
</P>
<P>
Her half-brother, Hank Williams Jr., 42, a celebrated country singer in his own 
right, refuses to acknowledge his half-sister, although he and his lawyers have 
been aware of her existence for at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
They declined to discuss the case. "Since there is ongoing litigation between 
us, our policy is not to comment," said attorney Chris Horsnell of Wyatt, 
Tarrant, Combs, Gilbert &amp; Milom, the Nashville firm that represents Hank 
Williams Jr. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Jett Williams -- as she is known professionally and to most of her 
friends but whose legal married name is Cathy Deupree Adkinson -- established 
in Montgomery County Circuit Court in Montgomery, Ala., that she was the 
biological daughter of Hank Williams. 
</P>
<P>
But she has yet to succeed in laying hold on the corollary to that fact: her 
share of her father's estate and his royalties -- which are said to amount to 
about $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who knew Hank Williams Sr. and have met his daughter agree that 
she resembles him. She has the same distinct features and steady gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Her quest for her father has a character of almost religious intensity that 
represents an unsettling precedent for other families with adopted children who 
decide to seek out their roots. 
</P>
<P>
She always knew she was adopted because she could remember arriving at the home 
of her adoptive parents, a prosperous Mobile, Ala., businessman named Wayne 
Deupree and his wife, Louise. When Jett Williams was 21, her adoptive parents 
visited her at the University of Alabama in Montgomery to tell her about a 
$2,000 legacy left her by a relative of her real father. 
</P>
<P>
With a clumsiness that only well-meaning relatives can achieve, Louise Deupree 
informed her adopted daughter that her real father was famous, a famous 
musician from Montgomery, and suggested that she take a guess at who he was. 
The then-Cathy Deupree guessed Hank Williams quickly, not an odd coincidence in 
view of his celebrity in Alabama. Her mother went on to tell her that there was 
no proof. 
</P>
<P>
In her 20s, Williams married and worked as a recreational officer in the parks 
system of Montgomery. The idea of Hank Williams would not go away, and she set 
about trying to garner information about her past. She encountered many brick 
walls. Finally, as she was about to give up, she was introduced by a relative 
to a Washington lawyer, F. Keith Adkinson, who had served as chairman of 
Democrats for Reagan in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Adkinson took an interest in the case and, subsequently, a 
personal interest in Williams. After Williams was divorced from her first 
husband, she and Adkinson married in 1986, and Williams says much of her 
strength is due to her relationship with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, she and Adkinson had initiated legal action in Alabama and New York. 
In July, 1989, the Alabama State Supreme Court found that Williams had been the 
victim of fraud and ruled that the estate of Hank Williams Sr. be reopened, 15 
years after it was closed. Williams has been judged an heir of equal dignity 
with her half-brother; his application to have the case appealed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court has been denied. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed earlier orders 
denying Williams a claim on her father's royalties and the Federal District 
Court, Southern District of New York, has judged that she should be given a 
jury trial to hear the merits of her claim. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Adkinson are understandably delighted with their legal 
achievements. For five intense years, they have lived with the emotional 
repercussions of intra-family litigation. Since that time, Williams has also 
sued her adoptive family over the contested will of her adoptive mother, who 
died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There have been few questions in Williams' mind as to whether it has been worth 
it. "I feel I'm a more positive person now," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't choose your real parents. For me the point is finding out what my 
father wanted and then carrying out his wishes," says Williams, and she returns 
to this idea, over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, she says, her life, from the time she was adopted, has always been in 
the power of the courts. "My life is still being decided by the stroke of pens 
-- somebody signs an order, and all of a sudden 'Bingo.' " 
</P>
<P>
There have been many personal changes as a result of the pen strokes that have 
brought her closer to her real father. 
</P>
<P>
She has adopted a stage name made up of the last names of both her natural 
mother (Bobbie Jett) and father. She moved from Montgomery to Washington after 
she met and married Adkinson. And she has long since ceased being a recreation 
officer and embarked on a singing career that emulates that of her father, 
including singing his songs, and wearing white, his signature color. 
</P>
<P>
Williams recognizes that her quest has not been without its complications: "On 
this hand, I got this, and on that hand, I lose that. You win a father and you 
never saw him." 
</P>
<P>
Her story is different in several respects from that of the typical adoptee. 
Although her natural parents were not married, they never planned to put her up 
for adoption. She was put up for adoption because of the action of her father's 
sister, contrary to wishes he had expressed in writing. This distinction has 
given extra credence to her camp's legal arguments that she is a legitimate 
heir. 
</P>
<P>
Before her birth, Williams' parents signed a contract that provided for her 
custody, partly with her father, Hank Williams, and partly with her mother. 
This document had been hidden for 30 years and came to light in circumstances 
that Adkinson will not divulge except to say that it was found in 1984 in 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
For Williams, who never dreamed she would see written, signed, notarized 
evidence that she was her father's daughter, it was the high point of her 
search. "When I got that contract and I knew that he wanted me and that he was 
my father, I just knew that I had to carry out his wishes, which I feel weren't 
carried out." 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams' songs aptly reflected a life of emotional confusion. Williams' 
mother, Bobbie Jett, was six months pregnant with her when Hank Williams 
married his second wife, Billie Jean Eshliman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, five days before his daughter was born, Williams died in the back of a 
baby blue Cadillac. The cause of death, though never definitely established, 
has been presumed to have been from complications brought on by alcohol and 
drug addiction. He was 29 years old. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hank Williams had considered what would happen to his daughter should 
he not be around to take care of her personally. He had asked his mother, 
Lillian Stone, to adopt the child should such a situation arise. 
</P>
<P>
This she did. But her action did not protect the little girl, then called Cathy 
Yvonne Stone, from the state adoption system. In a second twist, Lillian Stone 
also died a short time after the adoption was legal. Provisions that had been 
made to care for the baby in the Williams' family by Hank's sister, Irene 
Smith, were not taken up. Hank Williams' daughter went to the state for 
eventual adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly why Irene Smith chose not to keep me. I think it might 
have been because of wagging tongues, but I'll never know for sure," Williams 
says. Contacted by telephone in Texas, Irene Smith said she did not want to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
As part of her battle to assemble the truth about her past, Williams has had to 
face unpalatable facts. "I guess, as an adopted child, once you cross the 
barrier of 'I want to know' then you pursue it. It's the 'want to know' 
strength that keeps you going, even when you hit a dead end." 
</P>
<P>
But Williams cautions other adoptees to think carefully before pursuing a 
course like hers: "I wanted to warn adopted children to be careful when you do 
this because it doesn't always turn out. You have to prepare yourself for the 
worst-case scenario. I encourage adoptive parents that if the time comes, you 
should be a part of it -- if you can be a part of it, then you don't alienate 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
In Williams' own case, her adoptive father, Wayne Deupree, who died in 1983, 
had been able and willing to support his daughter in her search. Her adoptive 
mother found every part of her daughter's efforts toward her parents 
emotionally painful. 
</P>
<P>
Now that she knows who she is and where she came from, Williams' life has some 
of the trappings of celebrity that her father knew. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after they met, Adkinson had the idea that Williams should consider a 
singing career and saw to it that she was introduced to country music producers 
in Nashville. Owen Bradley, who produced Patsy Cline and other country stars, 
listened to her sing and felt she had potential. 
</P>
<P>
Williams received voice coaching and took steps toward her own singing career. 
Members of her father's original backing band, "The Drifting Cowboys," play for 
her whenever she performs, which she does with increasing frequency at state 
fairs, nightclubs and charity events. She says Hank Williams fans seem 
fascinated to see what she calls "the little more of him" that she represents. 
</P>
<P>
The Adkinsons live on a restored house boat, "The Jett Stream," moored on the 
Potomac in sight of the Washington Monument. Although her legal battles have 
yet to bear financial fruit, she hopes she is on her way to becoming Jett 
Williams, country star. 
</P>
<P>
"They say my father was the king of country music, which makes my brother the 
prince, the crowned prince," says Williams. "But I'm Cinderella, not that I 
marry the prince but that my life is totally transformed into being the 
princess. 
</P>

"To be a celebrity in the United States is like being royalty. Fairyland is the

MUSLIM SOLDIER ON A MISSION OF MERCY; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM FIGHTER: MOUJAHEDEEN REBEL MIRWAIS WARDAK HAS COME TO THE UNITED STATES 
SEEKING SEEDS AND MACHINERY TO REBUILD HIS NATIVE AFGHANISTAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
He is a long way from home, this dark, lanky Afghan in the flowing white 
clothes and bushy, untrimmed beard. As a devout Muslim, he is nervous to be 
photographed walking along the boardwalk at Laguna Beach, worried that the 
background will feature the oiled flesh of half-naked sunbathers, concerned 
that the photo won't play well in Peshawar. 
</P>
<P>
That worry, though, is gnat-sized compared to the monstrous problem that 
brought Mirwais Wardak here from Pakistan. He has not come to California to 
ride the Matterhorn, or to surf the waves, or to ogle the beach-goers. He has 
come to the land of the well-fed to ask for food, or rather, for the seeds, 
fruit tree cuttings, pesticides, irrigation equipment and farm machinery that 
will enable his people to feed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Wardak is a moujahedeen, a soldier of Afghanistan's Islamic resistance, which 
lost its most visible enemy when the Soviet Union ended its 10-year occupation 
of the country early last year. His last name -- Wardak -- is the name of his 
province. It lies perilously close to the capital of Kabul, where the 
Soviet-installed government of President Najibullah is still in power. The 
government was the target of a failed military coup in March, possibly 
motivated, said some analysts, by Najibullah's attempts to make peace with the 
Islamic rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan seems gripped by ideological confusion -- the moujahedeen are 
fighting less, the regime has not attempted to expand the mostly urban areas it 
now controls. Now, after more than a decade of war, the commercial and 
agricultural life has been so weakened there is barely a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
Wardak, a rebel commander and tribal leader, has come to the United States to 
talk plowshares, not politics. He wants to make it possible for his people -- 
many of whom have taken refuge in Pakistan -- to move home. 
</P>
<P>
Strolling with him on the boardwalk is his unlikely American host, John Kountz, 
a 55-year-old peripatetic librarian who first saw Afghanistan 31 years ago on a 
round-the-world trip and was so overwhelmed by the hospitality of its people 
that he is now repaying an emotional debt by orchestrating Wardak's three-week 
trip. In 1959, Kountz had been driving across Asia when he was turned away from 
India because he had no car insurance. He returned to Afghanistan, and found 
work at the University of Kabul with a team from the University of Wyoming, 
installing language labs. "Anything I can do for these people, I will," Kountz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He has offered his time, his telephone line and his home, a Laguna Beach cliff 
dwelling with a magnificent view of the hills and coastline. He has also 
offered his cooking, but after experimentation with dishes such as vegetarian 
pizza led to his guest's gastronomic distress, the fare has been simplified: 
beans, noodles, bread and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
This unusual pair met in 1982, when Kountz was hired as a sound man by 
free-lance filmmaker Mike Hoover, who was shooting the Afghanistan war for CBS 
News. (Hoover would later be accused of selling staged battle footage to the 
network.) During the expedition, Wardak was Kountz's guide and bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Kountz returned to Afghanistan, which, despite the war, allows 
foreign travelers to enter the country, and was appalled by what he found. 
</P>
<P>
"I went because I wanted to see what had happened since the Russians pulled 
out," he said. "When I saw the plight of the people, which is malnutrition, a 
destroyed country and an inability to go home (from Pakistan) because of all 
the land mines left by the Soviets in 13 years of occupation, I thought, 
'Something has to be done.' One night, Mirwais and I were sitting on a water 
tank in an area between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Mirwais said, 'I want to 
come to the United States to seek help.' " 
</P>
<P>
That is how an Afghan freedom fighter and a senior associate for library 
development in the California State University chancellor's office -- neither 
of whom knows a thing about securing tons of grain, let alone shipping them to 
the other side of the globe -- came to be collaborating on what they hope is 
nothing less than the regeneration of an entire Afghan province. 
</P>
<P>
Wardak, a 35-year-old father of three and scion of an influential Afghan 
family, has, like an estimated 3 million Afghans, spent the last decade living 
as a refugee in Pakistan, fighting the Soviets and the Communist-installed 
government of Najibullah. (An estimated 2 million Afghan refugees live in 
Iran.) Najibullah was expected to fall after the Soviets pulled out, but, with 
an estimated $300 million a month in aid from Moscow, he has proven resilient. 
The moujahedeen joke that when the Soviets withdrew, they sent 200,000 uniforms 
back to Moscow for dry cleaning. (Actually, the official number of troops 
withdrawn by the Soviets is about 110,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Now that the situation has degenerated into Afghan fighting Afghan, American 
support for the rebels -- who have received a reported $2 billion in weapons 
funneled through the CIA -- is waning. Many war-fatigued Afghans, such as 
Wardak, want simply to move home. Without the means to feed themselves, 
however, that will be impossible, and that is why Wardak has come calling in 
America. He is by himself, part of no official delegation, no formal tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The Afghan government wants people to be able to return," said Len Scensny, 
the State Department's Country Officer for Afghanistan. "But if there's 
fighting going on, it's a question of being able to restart their lives without 
interference. There's a definite mine problem, not just in farmers' fields, but 
on roads themselves. The roads are very dangerous. Wardak (Province) is quite 
close to the capital and fighting has continued there." 
</P>
<P>
"There are many worries," said Wardak, through an interpreter, "education, 
rebuilding the highways. But now, we would just like to have the hope of 
surviving." 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan speaks little English -- although his vocabulary includes 
"superpower aggression" -- and needs a translator to make his case. Kountz is 
enthusiastic, but hardly schooled in the ways of what amounts to soliciting 
corporate charity. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a curious thing," Kountz says. "Here I am, just a citizen, turning to 
various places to get assistance." 
</P>
<P>
He began with politicians. Sen. Pete Wilson's office put him in touch with the 
Department of Agriculture, which put him in touch with a grain company in the 
San Joaquin Valley, which told him what kind of wheat he'd probably need for 
the 5,000-foot elevation and cold temperatures. Kountz has also phoned the 
universities of Nebraska, and Iowa, and the departments of agriculture in 
Minnesota and North Dakota, not only to find out who might donate grain, but to 
find out how much grain is needed and how it might be shipped. So far, they've 
figured out what kind and how much grain they need, but not much else. 
</P>
<P>
The two flew to Washington last weekend, where they made contact with a network 
of Afghans, nonprofit development agencies and government officials who might 
be of help. 
</P>
<P>
One man they saw was Tony Campaigne, founder and president of the Council for 
International Development. Campaigne's nonprofit group operates projects in 
Afghanistan, Kenya, El Salvador and Guatemala. His relief and rehabilitation 
projects have a single goal: to help the indigenous populations become 
self-sustaining. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigne was not surprised to hear that Wardak was in town on a mission that 
sounds close to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me put it this way,"Campaigne said last Monday, the day before meeting 
Wardak and Kountz. "I have learned in Afghanistan never to judge what's 
feasible and what's not feasible. The Afghans have a particular talent for 
making things you think will never work work. If Mirwais is working on it, it's 
probably not out of the realm of possibility. I would listen to him very 
carefully if he came to my office." 
</P>
<P>
After their meeting last Tuesday, Campaigne was optimistic about helping them. 
"What they're talking about to me sounds like a very noble thing. We're going 
to help them out as much as we can. Wardak Province is in a terrible state, and 
I think there is a need that can be satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Campaigne said he will intercede with a Peshawar-based United Nations food 
program on Wardak's behalf. "And there are other sources in Peshawar we can 
help him with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then surely Wardak didn't have to come to Washington to get help in Peshawar? 
</P>
<P>
"There are all different ways to skin a cat," Campaigne replied. "If he hadn't 
come here, he wouldn't have met me." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department's Scensny echoed Campaigne's optimism: "Oh, he (Wardak) 
will definitely find a way. The Afghan resistance, and Afghans in general, have 
developed many imaginative ways to get things done. I'm sure he could get the 
stuff into the country once he gets it." 
</P>
<P>
Kountz is convinced he and Wardak will succeed. They have returned to 
California, where Wardak will spend several days visiting relatives in Mission 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He was going to visit family in Texas and New York on his way home next week, 
but he was welcomed back to Los Angeles the hard way: as he used a telephone 
outside the United Airlines terminal, someone stole his briefcase. They got no 
money, but they've robbed him of his ability to go home. In the briefcase, 
besides his airplane ticket, were his Pakistani refugee registration and his 
Pakistan-issued passport. His trip home may be delayed for up to two months, 
Kountz said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll see anything delivered to Mirwais while he's here," Kountz 
said, gesturing toward the narrow street below his picture window. "At least I 
hope not. I don't know what I'd do with 10 tons of grain in my driveway." 
</P>
<P>
On the Laguna boardwalk, topless young women with gleaming backs, raised 
themselves on elbows to get a better look at the strange tall man in the long 
white tunic and pants. Mirwais Wardak looked puzzled. It was hard to tell who 
was more surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"He is still talking about naked bodies on the beach," Kountz said. "He is 
afraid that fundamentalists in the U.S. would clip a photograph and send it 
back to his area to discredit him." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just the sunbathers, though, that unsettled the Afghan. "He has been 
astonished by everything," said Kountz. "There is such an abundance of things 
here, he just doesn't understand it. I sense a sadness in the guy. He's working 
from a frame of reference that we have no way of understanding. He's on the 
other side of the Earth. What else can you say?"

MICHAEL JACKSON: A SCOUTING IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He may not look like the quintessential Boy Scout, but apparently singer 
Michael Jackson has the right Boy Scout stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Enough to earn him an award in his name: the Michael Jackson Good Scout 
Humanitarian Award. It was bestowed upon him Friday night at a benefit dinner 
at the Century Plaza as some 700 guests gave him many standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jackson is a good example to youth, helping us keep kids off the 
streets by supporting Scouting," said Ray Martin, chairman of the board of Los 
Angeles Area Council Boy Scouts of America. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but is he brave, trustworthy and reverent? Would he have made a good Boy 
Scout even though there are no badges given for glove-wearing or multiple 
buckle-fastening? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think he epitomizes what's good about kids," said Martin, also chairman 
and CEO of Coast Federal Bank. "He supports what the scouting programs are 
doing, giving kids an alternative to street gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Jackson represents the change of image that Boy Scouts have undergone. 
In Los Angeles at least, the Norman Rockwellesque vision of the freshly 
scrubbed Boy Scout in a khaki uniform and kerchief doesn't always hold true. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be such a traditional organization, dealing only with kids in 
middle- and higher-income families," Martin said. "Now we're reaching out to 
lower-income inner-city kids. We're modifying, changing with the times. If you 
go to a Scout summer camp you won't see kids with kerchiefs on, you'll see kids 
who are finding out what it's like to go swimming for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with a VIP reception where Jackson posed for pictures in a 
corner of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I feel sorry for him," said one on-looker as Jackson appeared trapped by 
the crowd around him. "It's like he's in a cage." 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the photo session was over, Jackson -- wearing a studded leather 
jacket, silver-tipped cowboy boots and sunglasses that he never took off -- 
escaped through a narrow passage in the back, and emerged later at the dinner 
in the main ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined there by Chuck Norris, Scott Baio, Telly Savalas, Fred Travalena, 
Rick Pallack (who had received his own scouting award a few months ago) and 
Barbara Davis with her children. Some of Jackson's family, including his 
mother, also were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Sportscaster Jim Hill (an Eagle Scout) emceed the show, headlined by singer 
Stephanie Mills. A Michael Jackson video showed screaming fans interspersed 
with concert footage, more screaming fans, video clips, screaming fans, 
interviews with celebrities about Michael Jackson, and more screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Eisner, chairman of the board and CEO of the Walt Disney Co., was 
dinner chairman and presented the award to Jackson, saying, "I wasn't a Boy 
Scout but I was an Indian Guide, and we all know that's a whole different 
level." 
</P>
<P>
To the delight of his fans, Jackson said more than his usual breathy, pithy 
"thank you." 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the millions of past, present and future Boy Scouts," he said, "I 
will try to abide by your motto of being prepared, and always extending a hand 
to others."

A CLOTHES CALL; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: NOMINEES TURN OUT IN AN ASSORTMENT OF STYLES -- FROM ARMANI SUITS TO 
BEADED ENSEMBLES.

Minis, micros, long skirts and offbeat tuxedos were the styles favored by the 
stars Sunday in Pasadena for the 42nd annual Emmy Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
The awards were presented on a seasonably warm afternoon, but about 300 fans 
weathered the heat to gather across Green Street from the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium hours before the festivities began. A "Fear God" banner was 
stretched across the area. 
</P>
<P>
The fans went berserk when nominee Delta Burke arrived on the arm of her 
husband, actor Gerald McRaney. The Designing Woman showed up slimmed down and 
beautiful in a black beaded dress with rose lining. McRaney wore a matching 
rose in his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters, photographers and TV cameramen lined the red carpet leading to the 
auditorium and screamed and yelled to get the nominees' attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfre!" they screamed at nominee Alfre Woodard. "Over here!" 
</P>
<P>
"Who's your date?" they barked at "Twin Peaks" bad boy Dana Ashbrook. The 
attractive woman in the gold-and-black full-length dress was his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy Brown's" Charles Kimbrough, who was nominated for his role as stuffy 
anchorman Jim Dial, was one of the first to arrive. He seemed shocked at the 
insanity surrounding him. "I'm excited," he declared to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Keenen Ivory Wayans, the Emmy-winning creator and star of Fox's "In Loving 
Color," walked up the stairs unrecognized in his sweats and T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Also unrecognized was singer Julian Lennon in his sunglasses and 
double-breasted striped suit. He was accompanying "Wonder Years" regular Olivia 
d'Abo. 
</P>
<P>
Craig T. Nelson and Jerry Van Dyke, both nominees for "Coach," mugged for the 
photographers. Nelson wore a black tuxedo embroidered with a big orange eagle 
designed by his wife. Van Dyke wore a tux with a short jacket that made him 
look more like a bellboy than a nominee. 
</P>
<P>
"Quantum Leap" nominee Dean Stockwell quipped to the crowd that "elves" made 
his white tux and bolo tie. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Danson, on the arm of his wife, Casey, looked the winner, which of course 
after eight nominations for his performance as Sam Malone, the womanizing 
bartender on "Cheers," he was. His co-star and nominee, Kirstie Alley, shed the 
tailored suits she wears as Rebecca for a Vicky Tiel leopard-print chiffon 
gown. 
</P>
<P>
When the doors of the Pasadena Civic finally opened, the stars ran in quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time winner Candice Bergen stopped long enough for some pictures. "Murphy 
Brown" wore a drop-dead Karl Lagerfeld two-piece suit from Fred Hayman. She 
scurried up the stairs with her mother, Frances Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
Swept hair seemed to be popular. A very pregnant Marg Helgenberger, named best 
supporting actress for "China Beach," wore her red locks swept into a '60s 
beehive. She designed her copper shift dress with the show's costume team. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that David Lynch?" shouted a photographer. Lynch, the multinominee and big 
loser for "Twin Peaks," casually walked over to the throng. "I feel super," he 
said in his James Stewart voice. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Hamlin of "L.A. Law" avoided the reporters as he ran up the stairs with 
girlfriend Nicolette Sheridan of "Knots Landing." 
</P>
<P>
Plain and classic, though, was the order of the day. Blair Brown, nominee for 
"The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," looked elegant in a black dress with 
matching shawl. 
</P>
<P>
The "Twin Peaks" crowd seemed subdued. Kyle MacLachlan in his Armani tux smiled 
his best FBI smile for the photographers. On his arm was fiancee and series 
co-star Lara Flynn Boyle, who also was wearing an Armani. Joan Chen was a crowd 
darling in a makeshift flapper outfit she put together from clothes and 
accessories in her closet. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Mayron of "thirtysomething," who had trouble keeping her dress up last 
year, had no trouble this year in designer C.D. Greene's black tank dress with 
bolero jacket covered in tiny mirrors. Two-time winner Patricia Wettig looked 
radiant in her Armani pant suit. She was escorted by her husband and co-star, 
Ken Olin. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin Bernsen's vest was made from Japanese kimonos. Wife Amanda Pays wore a 
black-and-white mini. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Lee Curtis wore a red full-length Armani. Her escort and "Anything But 
Love" co-star, Richard Lewis, of course, was wearing black. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to marry you, Fred!" screamed a fan as young tuxedoed Fred Savage and 
his mother walked through the crowd. He looked as cute as a button.

Fox's smash hit "The Simpsons" was named best animated program of the 1989-90

<P>
At the end of the second quarter, the Raiders had the ball on the Seattle 
one-yard line, fourth and goal, score tied, 3-3. They called a running play, a 
dive over the middle by Marcus Allen. It failed. 
</P>
<P>
Big mistake, right? You take the field goal in that situation. Take the sure 
three points. It's what the coaches call "the percentage." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, with five minutes left to play, Seattle had the ball on 
the Raider one-yard line, fourth and goal, score tied, 10-10. They called for 
the field goal. They made it. 
</P>
<P>
The right stuff, eh? Take the sure points, the lead, maybe the game? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. The right move, going-by-the-book, was like saying, "I'll play these," 
not knowing the other guys were going to draw queens full. 
</P>
<P>
Those two decisions essentially decided the Raider-Seahawk game here Sunday. 
The one, the Raiders' failure, probably begat the other, the Seahawks' decision 
not to make the same mistake. They made a bigger one. 
</P>
<P>
The words win ugly have somehow found their way into the language. It's what 
the etymologists call an "oxymoron," a contradiction in terms, a 
non-possibility. "Win" and "ugly" should never modify each other. To win is 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders make a specialty of winning ugly. They are to football what Gene 
Fullmer was to boxing. They clinch, heel, swarm. They get off the floor. They 
are like a golfer with a truck driver's swing who keeps parring -- or birdieing 
-- the hole. They are the Arnold Palmers of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Schroeder would probably be the greatest quarterback in the NFL if the goal 
line were on the 30. Schroeder throws passes so pretty they should have ribbons 
on them. They're the most beautiful spirals you ever saw. They cut through the 
air like a ballistic missile. Coaches drool. They don't make the wide receiver 
who could run out of Schroeder's range. He completes these gorgeous textbook 
throws to the fleetest wideouts in the game. 
</P>
<P>
But they kind of remind you of the story the author, Dan Jenkins, tells about 
the time arm-rich Dan Pastorini, on a dare, threw a pass from ground level to a 
12th-floor condominium's balcony in Hawaii. Jenkins was standing with the 
ex-great Bobby Layne at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see that?" Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"What?" asked Layne. 
</P>
<P>
"Pastorini threw that pass on the 12th floor balcony!" Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Layne shrugged. "But the receiver was on the sixth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, too, seems to prefer to aim for the 12th floor. When he gets around 
the goal line, he seems to have trouble keeping the ball in the stadium. He's 
like the golfing gorilla who hits his tee shot 585 yards. And, when the 
cheering stops, steps up to his six-foot putt and hits that 585 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But when Seattle took its field goal and the lead Sunday, Schroeder found his 
distance. He threw these zeppelins to Mervyn Fernandez, Sam Graddy, Mike Dyal 
and Fernandez again. One of them, a long gainer, was even called back. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder put the ball on the three-yard line. That's not Jay's distance. So, 
they gave the ball to Greg Bell, and he negotiated the final three yards in two 
carries for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
If Jay Schroeder ever gets a changeup, the league is in trouble. He could throw 
a pass across Rhode Island and hit a receiver in whichever ear you wanted him 
to. But he would probably have trouble passing you the butter. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders won because they have the only million-dollar blocking back in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcus Allen story is the Mystery Of Edwin Drood revisited. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Allen is one of the five best football players in the league. He hasn't 
had a career, he's had a coronation. Heisman Trophy, Rose Bowl star, Super Bowl 
hero, no one runs with the football any better than Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he has undertaken janitorial duties on demand. At USC, he blocked for 
Charles White before he became No. 1 tailback. On the Raiders, when the team 
signed Bo Jackson, Marcus slipped into the fullback role again. 
</P>
<P>
This year, even before Jackson shows up, Allen has become almost a non-person 
on the Raider chart. He spent much of the preseason sitting on his helmet. He 
didn't get in the opening game until the Raider offense proved non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at Seattle, they gave Marcus the ball on two dive plays on the Seattle 
one. And, on the most important play of the afternoon, they lined him up and 
said "You block the big guy." Marcus Allen, legend in his own time, was laying 
a block for Greg Bell to win the game. Marcus was playing a position he had 
never played in his life before -- tight end. He lined up in the three 
tight-end formation because he is the only Heisman Trophy winner in history who 
could block a scarecrow. He cut down two tacklers. Bell could have gone into 
the end zone on a cane. 
</P>
<P>
A team that can use Marcus Allen to block and Jay Schroeder to throw short 
probably can be said to "win ugly"at that. 
</P>
<P>
What would be more to the point would be to say Seattle "lost ugly." Now, 
losing is ugly all by itself. It's got buck teeth, it wears glasses and has 
warts. And, for the Seahawks, the game might have turned on a call where the 
instant replay booth failed to overrule a call that went against them, a 
45-yard L.A. pass. 
</P>
<P>
That, you have to say, is ugly. But the real moral of the story is, never kick 
a one-yard field goal. Even if you win, that's ugly.

PADRES BURN BRAVES ON HITS TO HOT CORNER

Garry Templeton knows all about the good and bad things that can happen on the 
field. On Sunday, he saw both. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton hit a three-run double, and the Padres took advantage of four errors, 
three by third baseman Jim Presley, to score seven runs in the second inning 
and beat the Atlanta Braves, 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for guys like that," Templeton said of Presley, "simply because I've 
had games like that myself." 
</P>
<P>
Presley said the Padres were "hitting rockets." 
</P>
<P>
"You either catch them, or you don't. It was a tough day. All you can do is 
hope we score a lot of runs and catch up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen (11-13) gave up three runs on five hits in seven innings. One 
of the hits was Dave Justice's 25th home run, most among major-league rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton led off the second by reaching on an error by Presley, and singles by 
Jerald Clark and Mark Parent tied it, 1-1, against Steve Avery (3-9). 
</P>
<P>
After first baseman Francisco Cabrera misplayed Paul Faries' bunt, Parent stole 
third and scored on a wild pitch. Rasmussen singled, and another error by 
Presley enabled Bip Roberts to reach safely. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs later, Presley's third error on Joe Carter's grounder loaded the 
bases, setting up Templeton's double. Roberts hit a two-run homer, his eighth, 
in the third for a 9-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing against the Braves, we need as many runs as we can get," Templeton 
said. "That inning helped us out a lot. We were winning, 10-2, here early in 
the season and they came back and beat us, so we weren't too comfortable I 
think until about the seventh inning. To get a lot of runs against the Braves, 
the way they hit against us, was real helpful for us." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said, "baseball is funny." 
</P>
<P>
"Jim had a great game the other night. It's a lonely feeling when this kind of 
game happens. I might have had five errors one night myself," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves scored in the first on singles by Ron Gant and Justice and Presley's 
sacrifice fly. Justice and Cabrera homered in the sixth, and Mark Lemke had an 
RBI double in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres won the season series over the Braves, 10-8. . . . The three errors 
by Jim Presley were the most by a Brave player in one inning since Bobby Lowe 
made four in one inning in 1900. . . . With four more runs, Ron Gant will 
become the first Brave to score 100 runs in a season since Dale Murphy had 115 
in 1987.

FERNANDEZ FINDS BEST ROUTE TO END ZONE; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: WIDE RECEIVER SPOTS FLAW IN SEAHAWK DEFENSE, SUGGESTS PLAY THAT LEADS 
TO A 12-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS.

<P>
Raider wide receiver Mervyn Fernandez approached Coach Art Shell to suggest a 
play early in the fourth quarter of the Raiders' 17-13 victory over the Seattle 
Seahawks Sunday at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach, I think I can beat (cornerback Dwayne Harper) on the seven route," 
Fernandez told Shell. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches looked at Mervyn like he was crazy, but they called the play for 
him," wide receiver Tim Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's play called for him to run a "corner" pass route in a seam of the 
Seahawks' zone defense. Fernandez thought it would work because of the coverage 
Seattle deployed. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that they were in 'cover eight' with the corner playing up and the 
safety playing back, and I knew that we could put the corner in a bind if I ran 
a (route to the) 'corner' (of the end zone) and (wide receiver) Timmy Brown ran 
a flat," Fernandez said. "The corner either has to jump up on Timmy or come 
back on me. Either way I thought one of us was going to be open." 
</P>
<P>
Harper saw Brown and hesitated, leaving Fernandez open to make a 12-yard 
touchdown reception which tied the score at 10-10 just 43 seconds into the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said there was no way he could get to Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a bad break on my part," Harper said. "We were in a zone and I 
had the flat, and (Brown) was coming into the flat and I didn't get a break on 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to scoring the Raiders' first offensive touchdown of the season, 
Fernandez also set up tailback Greg Bell's game-winning one-yard touchdown run 
with a leaping, 24-yard reception to the three-yard line. Fernandez went over 
Harper to make the catch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how high I was," Fernandez said. "I just got up high enough to 
catch the ball. The ball was a little high, and I didn't think I could keep 
running and get to it, so I just jumped up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Harper said he was at a disadvantage because Fernandez, who stands 6 feet 3, is 
four inches taller. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way I could make the play," Harper said. "I was on him, but he 
jumped over me. A lot of big guys don't have good speed, but Fernandez can 
really move. You can't really tell what type of speed he has. He comes out like 
he's not doing anything and all of a sudden there's a big burst." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who led the Raiders with four receptions for 93 yards, also had a 
45-yard reception in an 80-yard, eight-play drive that culminated in 
Fernandez's touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
Although it appeared from TV replays that Fernandez did not have both feet 
inbounds when he made the catch along the sideline, the reception wasn't 
reversed because of a communications mixup between referee Jerry Markbreit, 
umpire Bob Boylston and replay official Bob Beeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over now so I can say that I did have one foot in," Fernandez said with a 
laugh. "I was concentrating on the ball. I didn't know where the sideline was. 
And when I finally grabbed the ball I had one foot in and didn't have a chance 
to get the other one down." 
</P>
<P>
Although Beeks said he had planned to reverse the play and rule that Fernandez 
didn't have both feet inbounds, he was unable to contract Markbreit before the 
Raiders ran their next play. NFL rules prohibit plays from being reversed once 
play has resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Boylston killed play with seven seconds left on the 45-second clock as the 
Raiders were set to run a play after Fernandez's controversial catch, and 
Markbreit assumed that the play was being reviewed. But Boylston later said he 
halted play because the ball had been accidently kicked, and that he was never 
buzzed to call a halt so that the catch could be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
When Beeks, upstairs in the press box, saw that the play had been stopped, he 
assumed that the officials had halted play to allow him time to review the 
play. But Boylston allowed play to resume, ending the opportunity for review. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, the officials make mistakes, too," Fernandez said. "They've called stuff 
that they shouldn't have called, so I guess they owe me one." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' leading receiver with 57 catches for 1,069 yards and nine 
touchdowns last season, Fernandez has become the receiver that quarterback Jay 
Schroeder throws to in crucial situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Mervyn's a big-play receiver," Schroeder said. "It's the same thing he did 
last year. When the chips were down, Mervyn came through with big plays." 
</P>
<P>
But Fernandez downplays his role in the Raider offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'm a money receiver or not," Fernandez said. "My role is to 
catch the ball when they throw it to me, and that's what I'm doing. They 
haven't put a sign up there (above his space in the locker room ) saying I'm 
the money man." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "Mervyn . . . didn't come out of college with all the accolades. So 
people are saying, 'who is this Mervyn Fernandez guy?' But people are going to 
learn."

GWYNN TO GET MORE TESTS ON FINGER

Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn didn't want to speculate on the severity of the 
injury to his right index finger Sunday after returning to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn fractured the tip of the finger during a 5-3 Padre victory in Atlanta 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I might be able to play, I might miss the rest of the season, I might need an 
operation," Gwynn said in local television interview. "We really don't know, 
because the X-rays I brought back from Atlanta don't tell the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn will undergo further tests today at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, after 
X-rays there Sunday confirmed the fracture. A Padre spokesman said a CAT scan 
will be performed to reveal whether Gwynn sustained any damage to the first 
joint of the finger. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of that examination is likely to determine his status for the rest 
of the season. The spokesman said Gwynn will either rejoin the Padres when they 
open a series in Los Angeles Wednesday or be lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
The injury occured in the third inning Saturday when Gwynn tried to catch Jeff 
Treadway's fly ball against the right-field wall at Atlanta-Fulton County 
Stadium. Gwynn said the tip of the finger cracked when he slammed his right 
hand into the wall. He left the game immediately and was taken to a hospital 
for X-rays.

<P>
Midfielder Jacques Ladouceur, one of only two Sockers to play in all 52 
regular-season games last year, might play in none this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ladouceur said he will not be at the start of training camp today (9 a.m. at 
Folsom's Racquet Club) and that he is considering not playing this season 
because he has not been offered an acceptable contract. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ladouceur, a five-year veteran, earned $20,000, but he likely would 
have made more had he not skipped the previous season because of a business 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
"And I had no problem with (last year's salary), because I hadn't played for a 
year," Ladouceur said. "But I gave my heart and soul to the team last year, and 
I feel what they offered me this year was not a fair offer." 
</P>
<P>
Ladouceur said the club offered the same money as last year, but Coach Ron 
Newman said it actually offered a raise, though he wouldn't specify how much. 
</P>
<P>
"Jacques has been offered a contract -- in fact, he was offered a raise -- but 
he declined it," Newman said. "Maybe he's waiting for something more, but there 
is nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers spent $718,500 on salaries last year, not including traded or 
developmental players, but because of a reduced salary cap, they can spend no 
more than $630,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
In 52 games, Ladouceur scored 12 goals and assisted on 13. He also blocked 23 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Branko Segota also is not expected to be on hand today. He is signed 
and entering the final year of a guaranteed contract, but he never returns from 
Yugoslavia for the start of training. . . . George Fernandez, the other Socker 
who played in all 52 regular-season games last year, signed with Cleveland.

<P>
If Leo Durocher were to spend some time with Tom Gorman, he would quickly 
conclude that, in most things Gorman does, he would finish last. Gorman, you 
see, is the consummate nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
Being nice, and being the captain of the U.S. Davis Cup tennis team, can be 
seen as contradictory. Should this country's tennis fortunes be in the hands of 
the Mr. Rogers of racket sports, or would we be better served with someone in 
the image of Woody Hayes, or at least, Ion Tiriac? 
</P>
<P>
Can a gee-whiz, golly-yes Tom Sawyer approach get the most out of the likes of 
John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, Robert Seguso and Ken Flach, each of whom has 
established at various times that he can be, to quote McEnroe himself, "The 
pits of the world"? 
</P>
<P>
Can you motivate cobras with saccharine? 
</P>
<P>
Gorman would answer yes, but he would object immediately to the cobra imagery, 
even though he has suffered more than his share of bites in his five years of 
directing the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s Davis Cup program. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't take any of the things personally," Gorman says. 
</P>
<P>
That is a sound approach at the moment, since any grudge Gorman might carry 
into this weekend's Davis Cup semifinal against Austria in Vienna could easily 
be directed at his star singles player, Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, a finalist in the U.S. Open, has been on and off Davis Cup teams during 
Gorman's tenure. In fact, last March, during the Grand Champions tournament in 
nearby Indian Wells, Agassi was on and off the team in one day. He agreed to 
play in the quarterfinals against Czechoslovakia, then quickly backed off when 
a question arose about how much of Agassi's entourage of 
advisers/agents/coaches/brothers would be allowed close access to him and the 
proceedings during the Davis Cup practices and matches. 
</P>
<P>
When Agassi changed his mind, Gorman was quoted as wondering about Agassi's 
"commitment." Agassi quickly responded with verbal venom. 
</P>
<P>
Some samples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Gorman makes me look like an idiot by saying he wondered about my 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "He's a chameleon . . . you've got a follower in a leader's position." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I feel like Tom, in my opinion, doesn't have what it takes to get a team 
directed." 
</P>
<P>
Now, six months later, Agassi will be directed by Gorman into a match starting 
Friday that could put the United States into its first final since 1984, and 
the first under Gorman. Also on the team will be Michael Chang in the other 
singles slot, and Rick Leach and Jim Pugh in the doubles. The Austrian team 
will include Thomas Muster and Horst Skoff in singles and Muster and Alex 
Antonitsch in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The match will be played in a soccer stadium, on slow red clay, in front of a 
specially configured seating area that is expected to hold between 10,000 and 
15,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, interviewed here Friday, said that he and Agassi have no problems. 
</P>
<P>
"That situation was the most difficult I've ever had," Gorman said, "but like 
so many things, it got blown out of proportion. Things were said at emotional 
moments that shouldn't have been said. And my statement about commitment was 
somewhat misunderstood by Andre. I was talking more about him changing his mind 
so quickly, and he took what I said to challenge his long-term commitment. It 
was almost like he thought I was questioning his guts." 
</P>
<P>
To do something like that would be uncharacteristic of Gorman. He is a 
diplomat. He is sensitive to others, forgiving, quick to praise and slow to 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
His longtime friend and best man at his wedding, Stan Smith, was once asked 
about Gorman's temperment. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't get mad, ever," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
At the recent U.S. Open, Aaron Krickstein was angry at Gorman for being passed 
over for the semifinals with Austria. Krickstein was the one who agreed 
immediately to substitute for Agassi in that match against Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Then, during one of Krickstein's matches at the Open, Gorman left the stands, 
and it was widely reported that Krickstein had asked that Gorman leave. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't exactly like that," Gorman said. "I was sitting with Aaron's agent, 
Dick Dell, who also happens to be my agent. Somewhere in the match, something 
happened, like some eye contact or something with the three of us. Nothing 
loud, no big scene. And I asked Dell if he thought my being there might be 
bothering Krickstein. Dell said yes, and so I left." 
</P>
<P>
But Gorman, ever the peacemaker, said he sought out Krickstein later, talked to 
him, listened to him, told him he understood his anger and liked his 
competitive fire at wanting to be on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I had two spots, that's all," Gorman said. "Then I asked him if 
he'd be ready to step in if one of the other guys went down, and he said yes. 
Later, I went back and watched his other matches." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Gorman does it his way, which is the upbeat, positive way. And 
clearly, short of a Davis Cup championship as captain, his way has worked well. 
In his playing days, he defeated the likes of Borg and Laver and helped the 
United States win the Davis Cup in 1972. He has clothing and racket contracts 
and does corporate appearances, and, at 44, holds the prestigious position as 
director of tennis at the Ritz Carlton Hotel here. 
</P>
<P>
And through it all, he has been a master at smoothing out the ruffles. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Agassi thing happened -- and that one was tough because it was right 
here in my hometown and I'm just not used to being in the middle of controversy 
like that -- I went to McEnroe," Gorman said. "I wanted to talk to him about it 
and kind of see what he thought, because he's been through so much of it. 
</P>
<P>
"McEnroe just laughed. That made me feel a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
So all that remains to be seen is if the U.S. Davis Cup team can win it all 
under Gorman. For Gorman, that would be swell.

DUGAN TOLD PRESS OF GULF BOMB PLANS

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney fired Gen. Michael J. Dugan as Air Force chief of 
staff today after Dugan's public comments about contingency plans to unleash 
massive air raids on Iraq and target Saddam Hussein personally. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan, in the top Air Force job only three months, violated Pentagon rules by 
publicly discussing likely military targets inside Iraq and disclosing 
classified information about the size of U.S. forces in the gulf area, Cheney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain things we never talk about. We never discuss operational 
matters, such as the selection of specific targets for potential air strikes," 
Cheney told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We never talk about the targeting of specific individuals, who are officials 
in other governments. That is a violation of the executive order," the 
secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never underestimate the strength of opposing forces or reveal previously 
classified information about the size or disposition of U.S. forces. Nor do we 
ever demean the contributions of the other services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Dugan's statements as reported in the press and as confirmed by him to me 
-- failed all of those tests," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan was away from the Pentagon today and not available for comment, his 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force chief took the job in July and quickly gained a reputation for 
openness with the news media and the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan, 53, retains his four-star rank, but he is expected to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"Protocol demands that he retire," a Pentagon source said. "There's no job in 
the Air Force he could really hold now." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Defense Department official said Cheney fired the general not simply 
because Dugan spoke openly to the news media but because he said things for 
which he had no authority. 
</P>
<P>
"It's saying things that aren't true; it's saying things that weren't his 
decision to make. He's not in the operational chain of command, and the idea 
whether Saddam Hussein is personally targeted -- those are decisions that are 
up to the President to make," said the official, who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney fired Dugan after conferring with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming Air Force chief of staff, Dugan was commander in chief of U.S. 
Air Forces in Europe. He was a combat pilot in the Vietnam War, flying 300 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan's controversial comments, reported Sunday by the Los Angeles Times and 
the Washington Post, were made during the Air Force chief's trip to and from 
Saudi Arabia, where he visited Air Force units deployed as part of Operation 
Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan told the newspapers that if the United States and Iraq went to war, the 
Pentagon planned to unleash an air campaign designed to "decapitate" the Iraqi 
leadership by targeting President Hussein, his family and even his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he intends to recommend Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, the commander of 
the Pacific Air Forces, to replace Dugan.

Iraqi troops today randomly seized young men among the thousands of refugees 
fleeing Kuwait but let their sobbing wives, mothers and other women go, 
refugees said. 
</P>
<P>
"My boy! My boy!" one woman shrieked, beating her hands on her chest as she 
described watching her 17-year-old son disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just sitting in the car and they put a gun to his face. The soldier 
said if he didn't come now we will shoot him," said the 45-year-old woman named 
Fatima, tears streaming down her face. 
</P>
<P>
Aziza Abdullah, 18, cried for her 23-year-old husband, also grabbed at gunpoint 
from their car. "I've only been married a month," she sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees said busloads of men between the ages of 17 and 40 were seen being 
shipped north, toward Iraq. No explanation was given. Other young men were 
allowed to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
Many refugees feared that the detained would be killed, and they mentioned the 
names of cousins or friends who were shot on suspicion of resisting the Iraqi 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"Every five minutes there is a new rule. First the women and children can 
leave, but no men. Five minutes later, everyone can leave," said a member of 
the Kuwaiti government committee helping screen the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers manning Iraqi border posts confiscated passports and other 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the confiscation of identity 
papers "is an ominous sign that these citizens of Kuwait may not be allowed to 
return to their homes." 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the 12 European Community nations decided today to expel Iraqi 
military attaches and restrict the mobility of other personnel to protest Iraqi 
raids last week of three countries' diplomatic compounds in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Before the joint statement was adopted by the 12 nations today, Britain 
expelled eight staff members from the Iraqi Embassy and ordered the deportation 
of 23 other Iraqi citizens. Belgium restricted the mobility of Iraq's 
diplomatic personnel in Brussels.

Likening David Brown to Charles Manson, a judge this morning ordered the man 
convicted of orchestrating his wife's 1985 murder to spend the rest of his life 
behind bars with no chance of release. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Brown, you're a scary person," Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin 
told the man who was convicted in June of setting up his 14-year-old daughter 
to murder his wife before secretly marrying his wife's 17-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
Brown sought to profit from the $835,000 in insurance on his wife. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin said that Brown, unlike some killers, did it all under the guise of a 
normal personality. "It makes Charles Manson look like a piker," the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In delivering the strongest sentence open to him, McCartin also said that if 
the Orange County district attorney's office had pursued the death penalty 
against the 37-year-old computer whiz, he might well have been sent to the gas 
chamber.

Tens of thousands of Bulgarian opposition supporters massed in the city center 
today to demand the resignation of the government of former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters waving blue flags of the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces 
chanted anti-Communist slogans and blamed the former Communist Party, now 
renamed the Socialist Party, for what they called national catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
"Communists, take your hands off political and economic power in Bulgaria," UDF 
parliamentarian Alexander Yordanov said in front of a crowd estimated by 
witnesses at more than 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The rally in front of the main Orthodox cathedral was the first organized by 
the UDF since the Socialist Party won an absolute majority last June in 
Bulgaria's first free elections after 44 years of Communist rule.

Hotel queen Leona Helmsley took out a full-page ad in the New York Times today 
to berate Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for calling his hostages "guests" and 
to appeal to him to let them go. 
</P>
<P>
"I know something about how one is supposed to treat guests, Mr. Hussein," said 
Helmsley, who is fighting a four-year sentence to federal prison for tax fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"In your bizarre world where detention centers have become hotels and hostages 
have become guests, I can make one recommendation that I have never made in all 
the years I have been welcoming people: Mr. Hussein, it is time to check out," 
the ad said. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, wife of real estate mogul Harry Helmsley, was convicted in federal 
court Aug. 30, 1989, on charges of cheating on millions of dollars in income 
taxes. She was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million. Her 
attorneys are appealing.

SOUTER WOULD NOT RULE OUT DEATH PENALTY

Supreme Court nominee David Souter said today he would not rule out the death 
penalty as a violation of the constitutional ban on "cruel and unusual 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that would be an insupportable constitutional conclusion," Souter told 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"That is an opinion I could not join." 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, Souter's view would be in line with the current majority of the 
high court. His response underscored his reputation as a law-and-order judge. 
</P>
<P>
Souter, in his third day of testimony, today explained his approach to a range 
of criminal law cases, including one in which he supported police use of 
sobriety checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, it ruled against the 
checkpoints as violating people's rights. But Souter alone dissented. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony today, Souter said the checkpoints differed from other 
searches because driving a car is "a highly dangerous and regulated activity." 
He said if the checkpoints were properly conducted, police were correct in 
using them to try to prevent tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The use of police sobriety checks was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier 
this year.

<P>
It apparently would be the first national referendum ever in the Soviet Union, 
and Gorbachev's proposal reflects the deep split in opinion about how to rescue 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke a day after 50,000 protesters marched to the Kremlin and demanded the 
resignation of Gorbachev and his prime minister over the state of the economy, 
which is plagued by under-productivity and worsening consumer shortages. 
</P>
<P>
In a 30-minute address to the national Parliament today, Gorbachev said the 
fate of farmland "is too big a decision, comrades, to be made in offices, 
auditoriums or meeting halls -- even as important as the one in which we are 
working today." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev stopped short of advocating any specific proposals.

REAGAN HAILS RAPID GAINS BY SOVIETS

Former President Ronald Reagan, who once dubbed the Soviet Union an "evil 
empire," told a Soviet Parliament committee today that he was amazed at the 
rapid changes in the country since he was last in Moscow for a summit meeting 
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, if Rip Van Winkle were to fall asleep in the Soviet Union, he would 
only have time for a very short nap before finding that everything has 
changed," Reagan told the Supreme Soviet's international affairs committee 
after explaining the folk tale of the man who slept for 20 years and awoke to 
find a different world. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many changes in those two years and four months (since my 
last visit) that I am beginning to understand how Rip Van Winkle must have 
felt." 
</P>
<P>
During Reagan's two terms in office, he oversaw a major U.S. military buildup 
he said was necessary to counter the threat from the Soviet Union, which in 
1983 he called an "evil empire." He then watched as Gorbachev's glasnost and 
perestroika reforms led to the warmest Soviet-American relations in decades and 
allowed the disintegration of the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with the Supreme Soviet committee, Reagan had separate 
private meetings with Gorbachev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Reagan greeted each other warmly, embracing and repeatedly 
grasping each others forearms before reporters and photographers were ushered 
out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure you must have sensed by now during your stay here in this country 
that we and people in Soviet society hold you in tremendous esteem and 
respect," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
In his address to the Soviet lawmakers, Reagan said he realizes reforms like 
the move to a market economy being debated in the Supreme Soviet are causing an 
uproar in the Soviet Union, and he advised patience during the transition 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan praised the changes that have suddenly put the United States and the 
Soviet Union on the same side in international issues, particularly the 
international condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"I have said before that we did not mistrust each other because we were armed. 
Rather we were armed because we mistrusted each other," Reagan said. "Well, our 
mistrust has given way to what might be called cautious friendship."

EMMYS: FIRST-TIME WINNERS TED DANSON OF 'CHEERS' SAYS IT 'FEELS FUNNY' TO 
FINALLY WIN THE AWARD WHILE KEENEN IVORY WAYANS OF 'IN LIVING COLOR' SAYS, 
'IT'S NICE TO BE RECOGNIZED.'

On a night when there was no dominant winner, the talk backstage at the Emmy 
Awards in Pasadena Sunday was narrowly focused on the individuals bestowed with 
the statuettes. Those who trekked back to meet the press -- not everyone did -- 
were happy but not always expansive. 
</P>
<P>
One of the happiest was Ted Danson. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran loser Danson, finally a winner after eight previous Emmy nominations, 
said that it felt good to be recognized finally for his work on "Cheers." But 
he also noted that, "It's new to my body; it feels funny." 
</P>
<P>
Danson is committed through this season to the NBC comedy, the No. 1-rated show 
over the course of the past year. Beyond that: "It's tough to say goodby to 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He attributed his success and that of the series to great writing. "It's the 
writing, come on. Funny things are coming out of our mouths," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, some of the success is due to the fact that "we don't 
rehearse until the very last second and we play a lot of football." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he had no plans to donate his Emmy to the "Cheers" bar: "I'll 
carry it everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Marg Helgenberger had definite plans for where to put the golden statuette that 
she picked up at the 42nd annual ceremonies celebrating TV's best nighttime 
programs and personnel. "I think I am going to put the Emmy in my baby's room," 
she said, after winning as best supporting actress in a drama series. 
Helgenberger, who is expecting a baby boy in seven weeks, plays the cynical 
prostitute K.C. on "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Her pregnancy is being written into the series. "They tried to shoot around 
me," she said for a laugh. "But only on the first episode." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if this will be the last season for her series, she said, "It's so hard 
to hear things like that. We try so hard." 
</P>
<P>
"My fingers are turning white, I have been gripping this (the Emmy) so hard," 
said Keenen Ivory Wayans, whose funky Fox series, "In Living Color," copped the 
Emmy as best variety, music or comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be recognized," he said. "We came on in midseason and only have 
done 13 shows." 
</P>
<P>
No, Peter Falk said, he has no idea why his "Columbo" is such a continuing 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to understand why an Eskimo and a descendant of the Aztecs 
all relate to him. From Bulgaria to Minneapolis, it's all the same." 
</P>
<P>
Falk, who won as best actor in a drama series, said that he was pleased with 
the show's scripts because "we don't cheat as much (on the mystery clues of the 
plots) as some other shows," he said. There are "genuine twists" and most of 
the plots are plausible. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbo" was dropped from the regular ABC schedule but is scheduled to 
continue in the form of occasional TV movies, in the vein of NBC's "Perry 
Mason." The actor said that he believes he can continue playing the character 
for many years, because age will give the tricky detective all kinds of new 
opportunities. Then, he launched into a very old-man Columbo, asking a suspect, 
"Now, give me a minute. I'm not sure what case I'm on." 
</P>
<P>
Candice Bergen veritably apologized for not having much to say, because, she 
claimed, she didn't feel she'd win again this year for lead actress in a comedy 
series -- especially after "Murphy Brown" lost earlier in the evening in other 
categories. She figured that Delta Burke of "Designing Women" or Kirstie Alley 
of "Cheers" would win. 
</P>
<P>
But, generously, she said that it was the whole crew that helped win the Emmy 
and she will "try to not be too piggy and take it too personally." 
</P>
<P>
Bergen reflected over earlier years when the film community generally frowned 
on the television community. When someone such as herself departed the former 
to join the latter, she said, "I thought you would have to eat at other tables 
in restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Jimmy Smits have much to say. He was a very sullen winner for 
outstanding supporting actor for "L.A. Law"; the charm with which he infuses 
his character of Victor Sifuentes was definitely not in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do this very well," he told reporters. "All the four nominations have 
been special and winning this has been especially special. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
It was some sort of cruel justice that Alex Rocco won the Emmy as best 
supporting actor in a comedy series for his memorable Al Floss, the ultimate 
Hollywood agent -- since his first-year show, "The Fabulous Teddy Z," was 
canceled by CBS because of low ratings. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to explain the show's demise, Rocco said that he figured "the 
little guy in Idaho didn't get it, I guess," he said. He invoked the language 
that Al Floss might have understood: "Maybe it was too inside. Out in the 
boonies (the boondocks), it went right in the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
As there are men without countries, one reporter pointed out that Rocco, a 
veteran of 25 years in the acting wars, is an actor without a series. 
</P>
<P>
He firmly gripped his golden award as he faced 50 photographers screaming for 
him to look this way and that, and told reporters that many possible options 
for Al's afterlife have been discussed by agents and producers. But nothing's 
been signed, he said, and now it's up to "The Big Guy,"' as in the Deity. 
</P>
<P>
Eva Marie Saint couldn't figure what was more rewarding, her Oscar for "On the 
Waterfront" in 1954 or Sunday night's Emmy for best supporting actress in a 
miniseries. She played Lil Altemus in NBC's "People Like Us." It didn't matter: 
Her finest moment, she said, is being a grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Saint has had her ups and downs, and she quoted Cary Grant on the best acting 
attitude -- that it's important "to stay on the bus . . . that some days you 
have to give up your seat, and even stand around a while."

The July 1 German economic union has created the strongest economic boom West 
Germany has experienced in the past 20 years, the Bundesbank said in a report 
today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Bundesbank said high demand for West German goods has caused a 
severe slump in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The West German central bank also said its economic analysis for this summer 
showed that the Mideast crisis and slowing trends in the United States, Great 
Britain, Sweden, France and Italy eased the pace of the West German economic 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
But the negative influences "were more than compensated for" by higher domestic 
demand after the July 1 German economic union, which involved the introduction 
of the West German currency and economic system in East Germany.

An aluminum furnace at a wheel manufacturing plant exploded this morning, 
spewing molten metal around a room and injuring 16 workers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
One worker was in critical condition after the blast at the Western Wheels 
plant, which manufactures aluminum wheels for cars. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Fire Marshal John Kaiser said the furnace blew up shortly after 
midnight. The blast spewed hot aluminum around the inside of a furnace room and 
blew a hole in one wall of the plant. John Alamo, a worker inside the plant, 
said the explosion shook the plant and set off a huge fireball. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate estimate of damage, and the cause of the blast was not 
immediately determined.

Cuba has bought 200,000 bicycles and is negotiating the purchase of half a 
million more to help the country face its severe oil crisis, the official 
newspaper Granma today quoted President Fidel Castro as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Granma said Castro told a group of young people doing agricultural work over 
the weekend in the town of Guines outside Havana that the government is also 
studying the possibility of building three factories to manufacture bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Castro did not say where the bicycles will come from but Western diplomats said 
they understood they will be from China. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a shortfall of 2 million tons in Soviet oil shipments and the crisis in 
the Persian Gulf, Cuba on Aug. 29 announced drastic energy-saving measures that 
included further restrictions in gasoline rationing to state and private 
vehicles and an order to "optimize" the use of mechanized transport. 
</P>
<P>
Castro said Saturday the government is also considering cutting back the 
workweek as an alternative to massive layoffs. Most Cuban employees currently 
work a five-day week and every other Saturday.

TENTATIVE UAW-GM PACT OKD WITH 3% PAY RAISE;

AUTO INDUSTRY: UNION CHIEF TELLS PLEASURE WITH CONTRACT. DETAILS TO GO BEFORE 
UNION BARGAINING COUNCIL ON TUESDAY.

The tentative agreement reached early today between General Motors Corp. and 
the United Auto Workers reportedly includes a 3% raise the first year, 3% lump 
sum payment the next two and retention of a requirement that GM hire one worker 
for every two who quit, retire or die. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just delighted we got this contract settled without a disruption," UAW 
President Owen Bieber said in announcing the agreement, reached after a 41-hour 
bargaining session between the union and the world's No. 1 auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement were to be outlined at a meeting this morning in 
suburban Detroit of the union's 300-member GM bargaining council, made up of 
local union presidents and bargaining committee chairmen. But that meeting 
broke up after only 15 minutes and was rescheduled for Tuesday because the 
printing of the proposed contract had not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Bieber said at a news conference before dawn that he was "very, very satisfied" 
with the agreement on pensions, and GM Vice President Alfred Warren said the 
contract gives the company latitude to reduce its work force. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit News reported some details of the agreement today, including the 3% 
pay raise and the work force agreement. 
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that GM would push hard to remove or alter the 
1-for-2 policy and that the auto maker wants to cut tens of thousands of hourly 
jobs and close up to four assembly plants to better compete with the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three auto makers lost about 6 percentage points in U.S. market share 
during the 1980s, while the Japanese gained the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the UAW council, the contract would be sent to the rank-and-file 
for ratification, a process expected to be completed by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW's old three-year contract with GM expired at midnight Friday, but both 
sides agreed to extend its terms while talks continued.

A private investigator testified today that former major-league Manager Billy 
Martin was driving when his pickup truck went out of control last Christmas Day 
and smashed into a culvert. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's companion that night, Detroit bar owner William Reedy, is on trial for 
driving while intoxicated, but he has maintained that Martin was behind the 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
William Fischer, a private investigator from Endicott, N.Y., and Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., said his examination of the truck the morning after the 
accident showed several signs that Martin, and not Reedy, was driving. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the fabric on the left knee of the pants Reedy was wearing when 
the crash occurred was imprinted on the dashboard of the pickup truck just to 
the right of the steering wheel. That indicated that Reedy slid across from the 
passenger side of the vehicle on impact, Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the private detective said that a footprint in the foot well on 
the passenger side of the truck matched a shoe Reedy had on and that an imprint 
on Reedy's jacket that night appeared to have been made by the radio panel of 
the truck.

Guard Brian Shaw said today he will return to play for the Boston Celtics this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw played last season for Il Messaggero in the Italian league. 
</P>
<P>
He later signed a contract to rejoin the Celtics, for whom he played during the 
1988-89 season. A Celtics' first-round draft pick in 1988, Shaw had one year 
left on his Italian contract, but had an option to get out. 
</P>
<P>
But after signing with the Celtics, he said he wouldn't play for them this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics took their case to federal court, where a judge ruled that Shaw 
could play only for the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always wanted to rejoin the Celtics, but after the upcoming season," 
Shaw said at a press conference today. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was in my best interest to play in Italy this season, then finish 
the rest of my career with the Celtics. The federal court has ruled that this 
option is not available to me so I didn't want to jeopardize my future in 
Boston."

Atlanta and Athens dashed for the finish line today in the race to host the 
1996 Olympics, with Toronto hot on their heels in case the leaders stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch was scheduled 
to open a sealed envelope at 8:47 p.m. local time Tuesday (4:47 a.m. PDT) and 
deliver the verdict to a packed audience including delegates from the six 
bidding cities. 
</P>
<P>
Athens, where the modern Games were revived in 1896, is the traditionalists' 
choice because of its ancient Olympic heritage. Drawbacks are inadequate 
communications and transportation systems and antiquated sporting facilities, 
but Greece has pumped $25 million into promoting its bid. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta has made perhaps the most professional and impressive presentation, and 
IOC delegates fondly remember the most recent Olympics staged in the United 
States -- the 1984 Los Angeles Games -- as the most profitable ever. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto has also mounted an enthusiastic campaign, while Melbourne is hampered 
by having to stage the games in what will be winter in the Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of preparations picked up today, with Prime Ministers Bob Hawke of 
Australia and Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece arriving to boost the bids of 
their cities, Melbourne and Athens. Actress-politician Melina Mercouri also was 
pushing the Athens candidacy, and former English soccer star Bobby Charlton was 
on hand for Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
Belgrade had Vlade Divac of the Lakers, while Atlanta had gold-medal swimmer 
Janet Evans, a Placentia resident who attends Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
All six candidates are scheduled to make their final presentations to the IOC 
on Tuesday before the evening vote. 
</P>
<P>
With 86 IOC members scheduled to vote, the magic figure in Tuesday's secret 
ballot would be 44. The city with the smallest number of votes will be 
eliminated after each round of the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC had other business to tend to today, including announcing a 
first-of-its kind international coin program to help raise money and celebrate 
its 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC and national mints of Austria, Australia, Canada, France and Greece 
announced an agreement to mint 15 gold and silver coins, bearing the Olympic 
rings, from 1992-96. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said this was the first time such widespread cooperation has been 
reached in a private enterprise using government mints to coin legal tender, 
although the purpose is to lure collectors rather than provide loose change. 
</P>
<P>
"These will be legal tender coins -- money. They will not be medals," IOC Vice 
President Richard Pound said. "But it's not the kind of coin you carry around 
in your pocket. They are works of art, struck from precious metals." 
</P>
<P>
The session also ratified the addition of erythrotropin, used in blood doping, 
to the list of banned drugs. It has been on the list since executive board 
action in April. 
</P>
<P>
One of the committee's oldest members, meanwhile, asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's Willi Daume, 77, "expressed the desire to leave the IOC," 
committee spokeswoman Michele Verdier said. Any such request must be approved 
by the full committee, and no word on that is expected until Thursday, she 
said. Approval of resignation requests is not automatic. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the resignation request was not known.

COMICS FIND LIGHTER SIDE OF GULF CRISIS

"A human shield? Take my mullah-in-law . . . please!" Barrump-bump! From the 
Top 10 lists of "Late Night" to the political humor of Will Durst and Harry 
Shearer, humorists are finding comedy in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, Iraq invaded Kuwait and erased its Kuwaitibank Visa card's 
$10-billion tab. That same night, "Late Night With David Letterman" offered 
"Saddam Hussein's Top 10 Reasons for Invading Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 6: "To impress Jodie Foster", No. 3: "Didn't have enough fuel and 
supplies to invade the moon", and No. 1: . . . (drum roll) . . . "Because the 
sand is always grainier on the other side of the border." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody said it's easy being a jester in the court of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard coming up with the lighter side of Armageddon," said Will Durst, a 
comic who specializes in politics and writes a weekly column for the San 
Francisco Examiner. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is funny; the invasion 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"When he invaded, it was tough," Durst said. "I turned it on him and made him 
the focus: 'You know Saddam is a bad guy because Switzerland is (angry) at him. 
Imagine: Switzerland, the Aunt Bea of the U.N.' 
</P>
<P>
"I call Saddam Hussein a yuppie. His motives are something we can all 
understand: Greed. I mean, this is a corporate raider with tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"At least this guy has a motive we can relate to -- because (as Americans) we 
never got past the suicide-terrorist thing. I mean, how do those people get 
paid? Is it a union thing?" 
</P>
<P>
Durst gets serious too: "It's obvious that America would rather sacrifice its 
boys than car-pool." Saddam, he said, "is the symptom, not the problem. Taking 
out Hussein would be like whiting out a tumor on an X-ray." 
</P>
<P>
Political impressionist Jim Morris made his name portraying Ronald Reagan as an 
amiable dimwit, but these days his focus is on George Bush and his handling of 
the gulf crisis. Morris says it's a sensitive topic and he's very careful. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a lot kinder to the President in this situation than I am when he wants 
to cut funding for school lunch programs," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the voice he calls "a cross between Liberace, Jack Nicholson and 
Mister Rogers," Morris drawls, "I don't hafta defend the way I been handlin' 
the crisis. M' door's always open. 'M never there, but m' door's always open.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Some top comedians aren't using the gulf crisis. "Robert Klein has nothing on 
the Middle East," said his publicist, Glen Schwartz. Richard Belzer said he's 
too worried about the situation to find it funny. 
</P>
<P>
"My problem is that Americans have such a short attention span that they're 
going to get bored and almost will something to happen," Belzer said. "I'd 
rather be bored for the rest of my life than have one 18-year-old get his head 
blown off because we're not prudent enough to conserve oil." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Shearer, a comedian, writer, star and co-author of the pseudo-documentary 
"This Is Spinal Tap" and occasional voice on "The Simpsons," uses the gulf 
crisis in "Le Show," his weekly National Public Radio program. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Le Show' is basically a topically oriented show," Shearer said. "I'm almost 
obliged to do material about the crisis. For the last four weeks it has pretty 
much been the only subject." 
</P>
<P>
A war without fighting is funny. Shearer acknowledges that gulf crisis humor 
risks offending people when a good joke is suddenly made tasteless by events, 
but he's also quite careful about his timing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it doesn't start to get risky, really, until body bags start coming 
back," he said. "Then all the equations start changing."

Bill Cosby may face a television challenge from the Simpsons cartoon family 
this fall, but he leads all entertainers in the money-making ratings, according 
to Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby topped the business magazine's list of the world's 40 richest 
entertainers with $115 million in estimated gross earnings for 1989 and 1990. 
The magazine said Cosby made $60 million last year and projected he would earn 
$55 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
In its Oct. 1 issue released today, Forbes said the 53-year-old Cosby is making 
an estimated $4 million a month on syndicated reruns of "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
Pop singer Michael Jackson, who hasn't released an album or gone on tour this 
year, fell to second place after holding the top spot for two years. Forbes 
said Jackson had two-year earnings of $100 million, $35 million of that in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's singing sister, Janet, is a newcomer to the list, ranked 26th with 
estimated two-year earnings of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
The rock group the Rolling Stones -- with $88 million -- rose to third place 
from eighth last year thanks largely to a big concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
Movie producer-director Steven Spielberg, whose "Arachnophobia" was a 
box-office success this summer, made $87 million to slip to fourth place from 
second. 
</P>
<P>
New entrants on the list were the teeny-bopper sensation New Kids on the Block 
in fifth place. Forbes said the group would make $78 million in the two years, 
$61 million of it in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes said the estimated gross incomes were based on talks with industry 
executives, lawyers, agents and managers. It said earnings figures for 
recording artists are based on royalty payments from record and video sales and 
estimated pretax gross for concert tours. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top 10 are television personality Oprah Winfrey, $68 million; 
actor-producer Sylvester Stallone, $63 million; pop singer Madonna, $62 
million; bodybuilder and movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger, $55 million, and 
Peanuts artist Charles M. Schulz, $54 million. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to the list included former Beatle Paul McCartney, with an estimated 
income of $45 million, thanks to a yearlong concert tour; actor Bruce Willis, 
star of the two "Die Hard" movies and of the December-release "Bonfire of the 
Vanities," based on the Tom Wolfe novel, at $36 million, and actor Sean 
Connery, who starred in the film "The Hunt for Red October," at $35 million.

Ed McMahon and his wife, Victoria, have cleared a final obstacle delaying their 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the McMahons said they had "reached an amicable agreement 
to our mutual satisfaction." The obstacle was not described and there was no 
elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, the 67-year-old "Tonight Show" sidekick to Johnny Carson and host of 
the "Star Search" talent show, filed for divorce in 1989 after 13 years of 
marriage. The couple have an adopted daughter, Katherine. 
</P>
<P>
After a hearing a year ago, Mrs. McMahon's attorney said McMahon had agreed to 
child and spousal support of $50,000 a month and shared custody of Katherine. 
The lawyer said the divorce will not become final until at least January, 1991, 
for tax reasons.

'POSTCARDS' TAKES NO. 1 AT BOX OFFICE;

"Postcards from the Edge," the Mike Nichols-directed comedy about a stormy 
mother-daughter relationship, starring Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep, 
claimed the No. 1 spot at the weekend box office. With ticket sales of 
approximately $8.1 million, the Columbia Pictures title gave a promising start 
to the fall moviegoing season -- traditionally more "serious" than the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Carrie Fisher -- who wrote the 
screenplay -- "Postcards" opened on 1,013 screens, for a per-screen average of 
about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hovering at second place -- in its 10th week -- was Paramount Pictures' runaway 
summertime hit, "Ghost." With ticket sales of $5.8 million on 1,788 screens -- 
a per-screen average of $3,284 -- the romantic fantasy has now grossed in 
excess of $141 million. 
</P>
<P>
In third place, with ticket sales of about $4.9 million was MGM/UA's "Death 
Warrant." Starring Chuck Norris heir apparent, Jean Claude Van Damme, the 
action film -- about an undercover cop in prison -- opened with approximately 
$4,583 on 1,069 screens. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth and fifth places, respectively, went to the summer holdovers "Presumed 
Innocent" and "Flatliners." With ticket sales of approximately $2.7 million, 
Warner Bros.' "Presumed Innocent" has now earned more than $74 million. 
Columbia's "Flatliners" had ticket sales of about $2.6 million, for grosses of 
more than $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
The just-out futuristic thriller "Hardware," about a murderous robot, claimed 
sixth place. With ticket sales of about $2.3 million on 692 screens, the 
Millimeter Films release had a per-screen average of approximately $3,323. 
</P>
<P>
In limited release, starring Sean Penn and Gary Oldman in a drama about the 
Irish mob in Hell's Kitchen, Orion Pictures' "State of Grace" performed 
impressively. With ticket sales of $179,927 on 14 screens, its per-screen 
average was a strong $12,852. 
</P>
<P>
Another limited release, Warner Bros.' "White Hunter, Black Heart" -- a 
fictionalized treatment of the making of "The African Queen" -- directed by and 
starring Clint Eastwood, earned approximately $170,000 on 24 screens for about 
$8,333 per-screen.

Country music singer Dottie West, who lost her mansion to foreclosure, says she 
will be off the premises by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
First American National Bank bought the mansion for $800,000 at a foreclosure 
sale earlier this year. An eviction order was filed in Williamson County 
General Sessions Court on Aug. 1 when West did not leave the premises. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the matter was delayed when she filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
West has been beset by financial problems that include an outstanding debt of 
$110,000 claimed by her former financial manager. 
</P>
<P>
She is known for hit records such as "Every Time Two Fools Collide," a duet 
with Kenny Rogers.

NEW SITES TO HANDLE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

<P>
Disposing of oil-soaked rags, used insecticide cans and other hazardous 
household waste will soon be more convenient for county residents as new 
collection sites open. 
</P>
<P>
Only one site, in Anaheim, now accepts hazardous household trash. 
</P>
<P>
But within a year, at least five new sites will open in the county, including 
two in Huntington Beach and Stanton within a few months, said Janice Oest, 
coordinator for the county Fire Department's hazardous materials collection 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents of Orange County have not had an alternative to get rid of hazardous 
household materials," other than special, one-time-only collections, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Each new site in the county will accept up to 5 gallons or 50 pounds of refuse 
per person, Oest said. 
</P>
<P>
Making the collection points more accessible to county residents is important 
because it reduces the amount of hazardous chemicals that are dumped with 
innocuous waste in ordinary landfills, said Huntington Beach public works 
analyst Jim Sankey. "A lot of people are throwing stuff away that they're not 
supposed to. But now there will be a place they can take it without charge," he 
said. The Huntington Beach collection site will open in November at the Rainbow 
Disposal Co. Inc., 17121 Nichols St. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton expects to begin collections by Jan. 1, and San Juan Capistrano, Brea 
and Irvine are expected to open sites within the next year, Oest said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Anaheim Regional Collection Center remains open Tuesdays 
through Fridays from 9 a.m. to. 1 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
