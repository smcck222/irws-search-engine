NEWSMAKERS: FUND RAISING FOREIGN TO OXFORD

 -- Oxford University will begin a fund-raising campaign in the United States, 
marking the school's first such effort outside the United Kingdom. The school, 
hurt by cuts in public funding by the government of Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, hopes to raise $400 million, and already has collected $112.2 million 
in Britain and from American corporations and foundations. Queen Mother 
Elizabeth, patron of the Oxford International Development Program, was one of 
the first to make a contribution. Sir Patrick Neill, vice chancellor and head 
of the fund-raising effort, said: "Posts stand empty as there is no money to 
pay salaries for new appointees. An alarmingly high proportion of academic 
posts have no supporting endowment." Prominent graduates among the school's 
9,000 alumni in this country will join Lord Jenkins, Oxford's chancellor, at a 
dinner dance at New York's Hotel Plaza to kick off the campaign. The alumni 
expected to attend the dinner include New York University President John 
Brademas, former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, Vanity Fair Editor 
Tina Brown, former U.S. Atty. Gen. Nicholas Katzenbach, Brown University 
President Vartan Gergorian, publisher Rupert Murdoch and art historian Rosamond 
Bernier.

 -- A Pole is going from "Solidarnosc" to the Stars and Stripes. Kazimierz 
Bascik, who created the red-and-white banner of Poland's Solidarity trade union 
in 1980, is going to take the oath of U.S. citizenship in Columbus, Ohio. The 
Polish government declared martial law when he was returning to his homeland 
from a visit to Ohio, so he detoured to West Germany and eventually settled 
back in the United States. He and his mother, Cecylia Bascik, live in 
Clintonville. After he takes the oath, Bascik says: "I'm going out to dinner 
and wave the American flag."

 -- As more than 2,000 Italians with speech and hearing impairments watched, 
Pope John Paul II dedicated a statue of a priest who worked with the 
handicapped two centuries ago. Priests and nuns at the ceremony in Trevignano 
translated the Pope's words into sign language as he said: "I exhort you to 
persevere without being discouraged by difficulty." The bronze statue honors 
Tommaso Silvestri, a priest who was the first man in Italy to begin educating 
speech- and hearing-impaired people. Before the dedication, the Pope prayed at 
the priest's tomb on the 200th anniversary of Silvestri's death. The pontiff 
also celebrated a Mass for 5,000 people at the town square. DAVE JOHNSON

VALENTINA SCHLEE, 90; DESIGNED CLOTHES FOR GARBO, HEPBURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valentina Nicholaevna Sanina Schlee, designer of clothes for Greta Garbo, 
Katharine Hepburn and other theater greats and socialites from the 1930s 
through the '50s, has died of Parkinson's disease. She was 90. 
</P>
<P>
Valentina, known simply to the fashion world by her first name, died Thursday 
at her New York City home. 
</P>
<P>
Known for such maxims as "Mink is for football," and "Ermine is for bathrobes," 
Valentina also dressed Lynn Fontanne, Katharine Cornell, Mary Martin, Gloria 
Swanson, Gertrude Lawrence, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell and Norma 
Shearer. 
</P>
<P>
The critic Brooks Atkinson once wrote of her that "Valentina has designed 
clothes that act before a line is spoken." 
</P>
<P>
She was her own best publicist, wearing her own clothes with a style that led 
other women to covet them. 
</P>
<P>
"She made many wonderful clothes, but nobody looked as well in them as she 
did," said Bill Blass, who made some dresses for Valentina in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Kiev, Valentina was studying drama in Kharkov when the Bolshevik 
Revolution broke out. She met her late husband, financier George Schlee, in the 
Sevastopol railroad station as she was trying to leave the country with her 
family's jewels. He protected her as they fled. 
</P>
<P>
After briefly living in Athens, Rome and Paris, they came to the United States 
in 1923 and became prominent in New York cafe society. 
</P>
<P>
With her husband's support, Valentina opened a shop stocked with 13 of her own 
dresses on Madison Avenue in 1928. In 1933 she established her reputation as a 
theater costume designer. 
</P>
<P>
Schlee became his wife's business partner and an adviser to Garbo. He died in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Her clothes were seen in such stage productions as "Idiot's Delight" and "The 
Philadelphia Story." She also designed Clifton Webb's dressing gowns and 
pajamas for "The Man Who Came to Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
The tall, svelte Valentina, whom many said resembled Garbo, closed her business 
in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by a nephew and two grandnieces.

ERIC WHO? RAMS TAKE TO THE AIR, RIP COLTS, 31-17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real star of Sunday's game, Henry Ellard, stood on his tiptoes and tried to 
get a peek at him. A nod would have been fine. Ellard leaned over the backs of 
reporters who crowded the losing team's running back at the 15-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Showing some of the moves he used against the Indianapolis Colts for 12 
receptions, 230 yards and three touchdowns, Ellard found an opening, slipped 
between two cameramen and touched the runner's fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
It was some scene, watching Eric Dickerson leave the arena. 
</P>
<P>
The game went to the Rams, 31-17, before 63,995 at Anaheim Stadium. But one 
moment was Dickerson's. In the context of the game he was a footnote, rushing 
for 116 yards in what turned out to be a quarterback shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
In the context of the week and the final scene, Dickerson remained at center 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
As the final gun sounded, several Rams dropped their scowls and surrounded 
Dickerson near the northern end zone, hugging him openly as their own fans 
jeered Dickerson from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to let Eric know that, no matter what, you're our friend," Ram 
cornerback Jerry Gray said. "He gave the Rams the best years he had. And he's 
still a friend of ours." 
</P>
<P>
Cameras and reporters followed Dickerson off the field. As the boos grew 
louder, Dickerson hoisted his helmet in the air. As he lowered himself into the 
visitors' tunnel, the crowd above littered him with play money. 
</P>
<P>
"It should have been real money," Dickerson said. "We would have stopped to 
pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Dickerson would have only changed the final score. For lost in his 
return was a show of offensive power from the Rams, who amassed 449 total yards 
against a defense that never quite got the message. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts guessed wrongly that the road to victory would begin with all feet 
running toward Ram quarterback Jim Everett. The Colts blitzed Everett 
relentlessly and didn't seem to mind that he was tearing through their 
secondary and the Ram record book. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts stubbornly insisted on playing wide receiver Ellard with single 
coverage, using tag-team cornerbacks Chris Goode, Eugene Daniel and John 
Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
"They had four different guys on him," Everett said. "But only one at a time. 
That was the key." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard had 112 receiving yards and two touchdowns at the half. Everett had 
thrown for 200 yards in two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the score was 17-17, so the Colts decided not to change the game plan at 
halftime. Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams dominated the second half. Ellard's 230 total receiving yards were the 
third-highest total in Ram history. Everett completed 28 of 35 passes for 368 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who completed his final eight passes to close out the first half, 
continued his streak into the third quarter, when he drove the Rams 77 yards 
for what turned out to be the winning touchdown, a six-yard pass to Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
Everett set up the score by connecting on passes of 21 and 30 yards to Ellard. 
Would the Colts ever learn? 
</P>
<P>
"They had Henry Ellard in single coverage," Everett said. "I don't think you 
can do that with him." 
</P>
<P>
You can't. Ask the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to take as much away from them as possible," Colt Coach Ron Meyer 
said. "We tried to put pressure on Everett. But they were just very good 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Everett ran his consecutive completion streak to 12 with the touchdown pass and 
stretched the streak to 14, breaking the club record of 13 by Pat Haden. The 
streak was broken when receiver Flipper Anderson dropped what should have been 
a 67-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
Everett said it was like playing catch, especially with Ellard, who was nothing 
short of unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost can't wait till the next play," Ellard said. "Especially when it's 
a pass route. You can't wait to get your hands on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Everett's only mistake almost turned out to be disastrous. The Rams had 
first-and-goal at the four-yard line early in the fourth quarter when an 
Everett swing pass intended for Damone Johnson was intercepted in the flat by 
Michael Ball, who might have gone 90 yards for the tying score had Johnson not 
wrapped him up from behind. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams escaped unscathed. Then they extended the lead on Greg Bell's 
two-yard scoring run with 1:34 left. And the celebration began. They flashed 
Dickerson's picture on the big screen and the crowd loved it. They flashed a 
banner shortly before Bell's leap into the end zone: Dickerson, that name rings 
a Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The fans whooped and hollered, far more than usual for an Anaheim Stadium 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"They were into it pretty good," Ram defensive end Doug Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be nice if they could keep it up." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's not every day that Dickerson comes back to town. 
</P>
<P>
On his first carry, Dickerson ran into his old friend Reed, who offered a quick 
hello before wrestling his buddy for a three-yard loss. Dickerson would have 
his moments, although his return became somewhat muddled as the arms race 
between quarterbacks Everett and Chandler escalated. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler completed 20 of 33 passes for 266 yards in the game, but didn't reach 
the end zone in the second half when it mattered. 
</P>
<P>
Everett started the shoot-out late in the first quarter when he broke a 3-3 tie 
by driving the Rams 79 yards on four plays, finishing off the series with a 
29-yard scoring pass to Ellard, who had beaten Goode over the middle. Ellard 
beating Goode would become a familiar theme. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts blitzed Everett on all four plays, later wishing they hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
While the Rams dogged Dickerson's every move, it was Chandler who cut up their 
secondary, hitting the speedy Clarence Verdin in stride for an 82-yard scoring 
pass to open the second quarter. That tied it, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts took the lead, 17-10, with 7:52 left in the half on a two-yard 
Dickerson run, capping a 10-play, 50-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Everett responded with the drive of the half, a 90-play march that consumed 
6:22 on the clock and led to a 17-yard scoring pass to Ellard with 1:30 left. 
Everett was masterful on the drive, completing eight consecutive passes for 78 
yards, including a fourth-down, 11-yard toss to Ellard to the Colt 27. 
</P>
<P>
Everett was 15 for 18 in the half for 209 yards and two touchdowns. Chandler 
threw for 170 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson rushed for 69 yards in 14 carries in the half, dispelling any myths 
about the Ram defense shutting him down completely. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson, who is glad to have this game out of the way, 
afterward tried to patch things up with his former star runner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Eric Dickerson is the best runner I've ever seen," he said. "I used to 
think that. I still do. I want to put to bed some of the second-rate things 
that can go on." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson was appreciative. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a compliment," he said. "I've had other compliments, but thank John for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
There were never many hard feelings among Dickerson and his Ram teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"He's good friends with a lot of guys on this football team," veteran tackle 
Jackie Slater said. "Him leaving was something we'd rather not have had 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
But it happened. And that's what made Sunday's game so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know whether to slam him down or kiss him," Reed said of Dickerson. 
"So we did a little of both."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
PADRE PITCHERS CAN'T STOP GIANTS' MITCHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a day in which National League pitchers were mostly in control, Kevin 
Mitchell used his bat to handle the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have made a late-season run that has put a scare into the San 
Francisco Giants. A sweep of Sunday's doubleheader at Candlestick Park would 
have put the Padres only three games out of first in the West. 
</P>
<P>
But in a rain-delayed first game, Mitchell hit two home runs to lead the Giants 
to a 5-3 victory that all but ended the Padre pennant hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell not only leads the majors with 45 home runs, he also leads both 
leagues with 120 runs batted in. He has a chance to be the first National 
League batter to hit 50 home runs since George Foster in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst pitched a five-hitter for his league-leading 10th complete game as 
the Padres won the second game, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst (15-10) who walked four and struck out seven, worked out of a 
bases-loaded jam in the sixth. Will Clark's single and two walks loaded the 
bases, but Greg Litton flied to right. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel (16-7) gave up six hits and three runs in seven innings, walking 
six and striking out five. 
</P>
<P>
The rainout Saturday that forced the doubleheader was probably a blessing for 
Mitchell. For several weeks, he has been bothered by chipped bones in his left 
wrist that eventually will require surgery. When he is rested, Mitchell can 
come back and hit the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no big deal," said the slugger who is virtually a cinch to win the NL 
most valuable player award. "It bothers me a little, but we're going after the 
pennant. I'll have that taken care of after we're through playing." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's bat enabled Scott Garrelts to improve his record to 14-3, although 
his major league leading earned-run average climbed to 2.27. He gave up six 
hits and three runs in six innings. Steve Bedrosian pitched the last two 
innings for his 22nd save. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Jack Clark had four hits, including his 23rd home run in the first 
inning that gave the Padres a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 2, Chicago 0 -- The first-place Cubs aren't just good, they're also 
lucky. When they go into a mild slump, so does their primary opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The team that is playing the best in the East already did the Cubs a favor by 
putting challengers into a slump. With Doug Drabek pitching an eight-hitter at 
Pittsburgh, the Pirates beat the Cubs two in a row, but it did little harm. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing two of the three to the Pirates, the Cubs' magic number is nine 
and they lead second-place St. Louis by five games. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, expected to be a contender, are finally playing to expectations. 
They won two out of three from the Mets, swept three from the Cardinals and are 
7-2 against the top three teams in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"Pittsburgh's been a good club the last two weeks," Cubs' Manager Don Zimmer 
said. "They've been beating everyone. But I kind of like the position we're 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 9-0, St. Louis 5-2 -- Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog blamed lack 
of hitting for the Cardinals' slump after they cut the Cubs lead to a half game 
Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been two bigger problems -- the injury to bullpen ace Todd 
Worrell and the recent ineffectiveness of 18-game winner Joe Magrane. 
</P>
<P>
Both problems hurt the Cardinals at Philadelphia where a sweep could have moved 
St. Louis to within four games of the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, trying for the fourth time to win his 19th game in a season in which 
he has pitched more innings (214) than ever, had a 5-1 lead in the sixth 
inning. With Worrell injured, there was nobody to come in when Magrane 
faltered. The Phillies won it when John Kruk hit a grand slam with two out in 
the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 1, New York 0 -- Talking about teams having troubles scoring brings to 
mind the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
They managed to get Mark Langston out of his slump at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was only 1-4 with an earned-run average of 5.17 in his five previous 
starts. But he held the Mets to three hits and struck out nine to improve to 
12-7 and record his fourth shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 1, Cincinnati 0 -- Mark Portugal has been a fortunate find for the 
Astros. Portugal, unsuccessful with Minnesota, pitched a five-hitter for his 
first shutout in a game at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal is 6-1 since joining the Astros after an 11-19 record in four seasons 
with the Twins. Ken Caminiti's 10th home run leading off the fifth inning was 
the only run. DAN HAFNER

CHARGERS MAKE TOO MANY MISTAKES TO WIN

The Chargers made enough mistakes Sunday against the Houston Oilers to ruin the 
most statistically productive afternoon of Jim McMahon's storied eight-year NFL 
career. 
</P>
<P>
They committed 13 penalties for 117 yards. They turned the ball over five times 
without taking it away once. And for the second consecutive week, their special 
teams looked like the Keystone Cops. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Chargers lost, 34-27. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon passed for 389 yards and two touchdowns. But he also threw three 
interceptions, one of which led to a Houston touchdown. The two fumbles by 
McMahon's running backs also turned into Oiler touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have thrown for 500 yards today," McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
The only other NFL game in which he has thrown for more than 300 yards was in 
1987 against Denver. He lost on that day, too. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second defeat in as many weeks for the Chargers, who have now 
allowed 74 points in two games. And it was witnessed by the smallest crowd for 
a home opener -- 42,013 -- since absentee owner Alex Spanos bought the team in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers still had a chance to win with 55 seconds left when Lester Lyles 
recovered Chris Bahr's onside kick at the Charger 45 after wide receiver 
Anthony Miller's second touchdown reception had cut the lead to seven. 
</P>
<P>
But the officials ruled that Lyles had touched the ball before it traveled the 
required 10 yards. After prolonged delays and reviews, replay official Royal 
Cathcart upheld the original call. The Oilers promptly ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
When the game was over, Charger Coach Dan Henning and Oiler Coach Jerry 
Glanville didn't shake hands. Probably, they were too busy shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Henning had watched a 14-3 Charger lead turn into a 34-14 Houston advantage in 
less than two periods. Glanville had watched replay after replay after replay 
of the controversial onside kick shown on the stadium scoreboard screen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Henning said. "One official said his final decision was our 
player touched the ball too early. He said our guy (Lyles) took off before the 
45 and touched the ball before it went far enough. I can't argue with his 
decision if that's the way he saw it. But if that's how he saw it, it shouldn't 
have gone through two reviews." 
</P>
<P>
Charger defensive back Elvis Patterson insisted the officials shouldn't have 
called so many penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they should let us play football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When are they going to let the players get back to playing instead of the 
officials playing?" he added. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, the most penalized team in the league last year and last week, 
committed eight penalties for 70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was Patterson's block of a Greg Montgomery punt that gave the Chargers the 
ball at the Houston one on the second play of the second period. Moments later, 
the first of rookie Marion Butts' two one-yard touchdown bursts put the 
Chargers on top, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had taken the lead 10 minutes into the first period when McMahon 
found Miller uncovered on the left sideline. Miller faked out free safety Tracy 
Eaton at the Oiler 22 and raced into the end zone to complete a 63-yard play. 
Before that, the only scoring had been a 24-yard field goal by Tony Zendejas. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson's punt block was the only bright spot for beleaguered special teams 
Coach Joe Madden whose player or players: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allowed a 63-yard kickoff return on the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roughed the Houston punter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shanked a punt 14 yards out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mishandled a snap that cost the Chargers an extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the play on which return man Darryl Usher received a penalty 
when he grabbed an opponent's face mask. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to go back to work and make sure those things don't kill us," 
Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Warren Moon finished with 21 completions in 35 attempts for 235 
yards. The Chargers never sacked him. And, admitted defensive coordinator Ron 
Lynn, they didn't expect the Oilers to stay in their run-and-shoot offense 
(featuring four wide receivers) for almost three fourths of the game.

HOGEBOOM IS AT HOME, CARDINALS WIN ON ROAD

<P>
Gary Hogeboom has found a home and the Phoenix Cardinals have found a 
quarterback to replace Neil Lomax. 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom passed for four touchdowns, three to Roy Green, and led the Cardinals 
to a 34-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what my statistics were but I'm happy with them because we won," 
said Hogeboom, who gave much of the credit for his big day to receivers Green 
and J.T. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people can cover these guys man on man. They're so smart they 
know the coverages and know the openings." 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom, who spent six seasons in Dallas and three in Indianapolis, had 
touchdown passes of 59, 51 and six yards to Green, and 25 yards to Smith. He 
completed 18 of 24 passes for 298 yards. 
</P>
<P>
While Hogeboom wanted to share the spotlight, Cardinal Coach Gene Stallings 
wanted to give his quarterback much of the credit for the Cardinals' 
season-opening road wins in Detroit and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary moved the team up and down the field," Stallings said. "He's a heads-up 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom lost starting jobs in Dallas and Indianapolis, but there wasn't 
anybody to lose to in Phoenix after Lomax was placed on injured reserve for the 
season with an arthritic hip. 
</P>
<P>
Timm Rosenbach, a highly regarded quarterback prospect from Washington State, 
held out and missed most of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals also rushed for 171 yards and finished with 469 yards in total 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Dave Krieg passed for three touchdowns and 279 yards. He had scoring 
passes of 17 and three yards to Paul Skansi, and five yards to Brian Blades. 
Norm Johnson kicked a 39-yard field goal for the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seahawks' running game was nullified in the second half when Phoenix 
scored on their first possession of the third quarter for a 20-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened in Seattle's 31-7 loss in Philadelphia last week. 
</P>
<P>
"What we needed to do was get ahead of these guys so we could go back to our 
game plan," Krieg said when asked why the Seahawks abandoned their running game 
after the Cardinals built their lead.

Joe Montana didn't enjoy himself, until it was over. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, who struggled for most of the game, ran four yards for a touchdown 
with 40 seconds left Sunday to give the San Francisco 49ers a 20-16 victory 
over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not fun to play that way, and it wasn't fun to have to come back from 
behind," Montana said. "But a lot of us have been in those situations before 
and we didn't get rattled." 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde gave the Buccaneers (1-1) a 16-13 lead with an 18-yard scoring 
pass to Mark Carrier with 3 1/2 minutes left, but that is too much time to give 
Montana with the game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
The final scoring drive featured completions of 15 yards to John Taylor and Tom 
Rathman as well as an 11-yarder to Jerry Rice, whose two-yard touchdown catch 
gave San Francisco (2-0) a 13-9 lead with 8:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a team that's done it so many times," Testaverde said of the 49ers' 
decisive 10-play, 70-yard drive. "It was a sick feeling watching them do it 
live." 
</P>
<P>
Montana and the 49ers' offense didn't get on track until after Tampa Bay went 
ahead, 9-6, on Donald Igwebuike's third field goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Montana completed four of seven passes for 53 yards on the game-winning drive. 
He rolled around right end for his touchdown two plays after a holding penalty 
on Tampa Bay's Donnie Elder nullified a third-down incompletion that would have 
forced the 49ers to try for a game-tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Montana finished with 25 completions in 39 attempts for 266 yards, one 
touchdown and two interceptions. Rice had eight receptions for 122 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde, coming off the best game of his brief career in Tampa Bay's 
season-opening victory over Green Bay, minimized errors for the second straight 
week with a short passing game. 
</P>
<P>
He completed 14 of 35 for 146 yards and a touchdown with two interceptions, 
both by Ronnie Lott. However, both came on desperation throws, on the last play 
of the first half and the last play of the game.

PATRIOTS CAN'T KICK IN 24-10 LOSS TO MIAMI

Things have never been easy against the New England Patriots for Dan Marino, 
until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Marino threw three touchdown passes in the first half and the Miami Dolphins 
capitalized on botched punt plays on the Patriots' first two possessions for a 
24-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We got field position early and kept moving the ball well," Marino said. "When 
we got ahead, they had to throw on nearly every down." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (1-1) ended a 10-game losing streak against AFC East rivals and a 
seven-game string of setbacks against the Patriots (1-1), who last lost to 
Miami on Dec. 16, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Marino is 4-8 against the Patriots in his career. 
</P>
<P>
New England mistakes gave Miami the ball inside New England's 30-yard line 
twice, leading to 10 early points and a 24-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The first half was a thing of beauty," Miami Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
Patriot quarterback Tony Eason was sacked seven times, the most by the Dolphins 
since Sept. 14, 1986. Miami extended its NFL record to 14 straight games 
without allowing a sack. 
</P>
<P>
New England tried to surprise Miami with a fake punt from its own 20 after the 
Dolphins stopped the Patriots on their first series. However, punter Jeff 
Feagles overthrew Sammy Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Marino capitalized with a 16-yard scoring pass, the first of his two touchdown 
passes to utilityman Jim Jensen, giving the Dolphins a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, the Patriots botched another punt minutes later. A poor snap to 
Feagles led to another incomplete pass by the punter and gave Miami the ball at 
the Patriot 29. This time, the Dolphins settled for a 31-yard field goal by 
Pete Stoyanovich, making the score 17-0 with 4:04 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Clayton, who began practicing with the Dolphins Tuesday after missing 
training camp and the first game of the regular season because he held out in a 
contract dispute, caught a 15-yard touchdown pass from Marino on the first 
series of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We played together for six years," Clayton said. "(Marino) knows what I think 
and I know what he thinks." 
</P>
<P>
Miami's final score of the first half came on a nine-play, 65-yard drive capped 
by Marino's 10-yard touchdown pass to Jensen 7:45 before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
New England scored on Greg Davis' 28-yard field goal in the third quarter and 
Eason's 10-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes on the 
last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Marino completed 17 of 28 passes for 226 yards but had three interceptions to 
go with his three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The three touchdown passes gave Marino 200 for his career in only 89 games, 
establishing an NFL record for reaching that plateau in the fewest games. 
Johnny Unitas of the Baltimore Colts set the record of 200 in his first 121 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough," Patriot cornerback Raymond Clayborn said of Marino. "That's how 
he set the record. He can throw it over anyone when he's hot." 
</P>
<P>
Forced to throw most of the second half, Eason completed 25 of 49 passes for 
341 yards and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Morgan caught six of those passes for 88 yards, giving him 10,028 
career receiving yards and making him the seventh NFL player to reach 10,000 
receiving yards.

SIMMS GIVES GIANTS WAKE-UP CALL

<P>
A year ago when the Detroit Lions made the New York Giants look bad for a half, 
Harry Carson woke up the team by throwing a few chairs in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lions did the same thing to the Giants on Sunday, Carson, who has 
retired, wasn't around to stir things up. 
</P>
<P>
So the job fell on quarterback Phil Simms, who completed 12 of 14 second-half 
passes to set up three touchdowns and rally New York from an 11-point deficit 
to a 24-14 victory over the Lions. The Giants (2-0) have won their first two 
games for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't make mistakes, like we did in the first half," said Simms, who 
finished with 20 of 26 for 218 yards and two touchdowns. "In the first half, 
the plays were there and we blew it, missed passes and the fumbled at the goal 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Simms said there is no comparing this year's victory to the 30-10 win here a 
year ago. In that game, New York scored 23 second-half points to rally from a 
10-7 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Simms hit Odessa Turner on a nine-yard, go-ahead touchdown pass with 
43 seconds left in the third quarter and found tight end Mark Bavaro on a 
24-yard scoring pass with 9:42 to left. 
</P>
<P>
Ottis Anderson rushed for 85 yards in 25 carries, including an 11-yard 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit quarterback Bob Gagliano, who completed 21 of 31 passes for 344 yards 
and three interceptions, gave the Lions a 7-3 halftime lead on a 71-yard 
scoring pass to Richard Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions stretched it to 14-3 with 9:55 left in the third quarter when rookie 
Barry Sanders bounced off two tackles to score on a four-yard run, but the 
Lions were shut out the rest of the way.

It took failure for Chip Hanauer to fully realize what he has accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
His hopes of winning an eighth consecutive American Power Boat Assn. Gold Cup 
disappeared shortly before he reached the first turn of Sunday's unlimited 
hydroplane final at Mission Bay. The hot end of the turbine engine in his 
Circus Circus lost power, making room for Tom D'Eath of Fairhaven, Mich. to win 
in Miss Budweiser. D'Eath had a six-lap average of 124.593 m.p.h. on the 2 
1/2-mile oval course for his first Gold Cup victory since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
While D'Eath completed the first three laps, Hanauer attempted to re-start 
Circus Circus until his battery indicated to him that enough was enough. Then, 
he watched. 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer, a Seattle driver with 29 unlimited victories, has a history of 
worrying himself through race weekends, so he never really took time to reflect 
on nearly equaling Bill Muncey's record of eight consecutive Gold Cup 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
As he was towed back to the pits by a patrol boat traveling 185 miles per hour 
slower than an unlimited hydroplane, he finally thought to himself: "Hey Chip, 
nice going." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was wrong to look back because yesterday's home run is no good to 
anybody," Hanauer said. "The last 15 minutes is the first time I've allowed 
myself to look back and say, 'That's pretty neat looking.' I think we left a 
pretty high mark for everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
After the race, D'Eath took a moment to clasp his hands in prayer and look 
toward the sky before he climbed from Miss Budweiser to the open arms of his 
ecstatic crew. When Miss Budweiser ran low on fuel at the end of the fourth lap 
and lost speed, it appeared George Woods Jr. of Seattle would score his second 
consecutive victory at Mission Bay.

SAILING AT SAN FRANCISCO; 
</P>
<P>
LEWIS IS A RACE SHORT AS RANDY SMYTH WINS

Cam Lewis said he had the feeling all week that "somebody's looking over my 
shoulder," but Sunday the specter of Tom Blackaller must have been kicking him 
in the backside. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't fill Tom's sea boots, but Tom's a competitive guy," Lewis said. "I 
think he'd be proud of us for what we did." 
</P>
<P>
If it wasn't quite enough to prevent Randy Smyth of Huntington Beach from 
winning his second Salem ProSail championship for 40-foot catamarans, few could 
fault Lewis and his six-man crew for their effort. He had moved from bowman to 
inherit the tiller from Blackaller, who died of a heart attack while practicing 
for a sports car race at Sears Point 11 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
By winning two of the three previous ProSail events, Blackaller had led Smyth 
by one point coming to San Francisco, and after three races Friday and two 
Saturday, Lewis started the final round Sunday trailing Smyth in the regatta, 
five points to 10 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't over yet," Lewis warned. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 32, of Newport, R.I., steered the boat around a three-mile course in San 
Francisco Bay to three victories in the first four of five races Sunday and, 
for a time, seemed within reach of a dramatic victory. 
</P>
<P>
What neither sailor knew was that Lewis had run out of races. He needed to beat 
Smyth in two more, but organizers had planned only one, and Smyth won that with 
a remarkable comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth, a 1984 Olympic silver medalist, was feeling the pressure when he jumped 
the starting gun in the final race and had to perform a 360-degree turn in the 
uncharacteristically light Bay winds. 
</P>
<P>
But then he started picking off the five-boat fleet one by one and streaked 
past the finish line between Pier 39 and Alcatraz nearly a minute in front. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth, 35, wound up the winner, 13 1/2 to 17. Overall in the four-event series, 
Smyth broke the 2-2 tie by beating Blackaller/Lewis head to head, 19-16. 
</P>
<P>
For the series, Smyth won a total of $100,000, including $26,000 for the 
overall title. Blackaller/Lewis won $88,000. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the usual strong and tricky Bay currents, the competitors had to 
contend with shifting winds and rain. They started the first two races eastward 
toward Oakland, and when the wind turned they switched the course toward the 
Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis called it "one of those weird San Francisco days. These races may take 
only five or 10 minutes, but it's a lot more grueling than 12-meter racing 
because you're pushing every second." 
</P>
<P>
Smyth said: "What Cam didn't realize is that it just wasn't the loss of one 
person on board but two. With Cam in the back of the boat, they also lost the 
best foredeck guy they had." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic sailor Pete Melvin of Seal Beach, with Steve Rosenberg of Long Beach as 
crew, had a victory and two seconds Sunday to claim the Hobie 21 title among 21 
boats and win $21,300.

Kathy Rinaldi had eight service breaks during a 7-5, 7-5 victory over 
second-seeded Pam Shriver in the rain-delayed All-American tennis championships 
Sunday at Amelia Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver countered with six service breaks of her own, but the baseline style of 
Rinaldi prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a lot of pressure on each other's serves," Rinaldi said. "At first I 
thought I was going to lose because I was playing too safe instead of going for 
it. But looking back, I feel I played really well."

The nation's broadcasters have been urged by the new chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission to tune out "shock radio" programs that use sexually 
and racially oriented humor to attract audiences. "We are not simply recorders, 
transmitters and antennas," Alfred Sikes said at the National Assn. of 
Broadcasters' radio convention in New Orleans. "We are what we broadcast." 
Sikes, a former owner of several radio stations, said that the association 
should revive its programming code, dropped in the early 1980s as the result of 
a federal anti-trust lawsuit against provisions regarding commercials. Such 
standards should be drawn up by the industry without government pressure, said 
Sikes, who took over the FCC chair in August. ALEENE MacMINN

Denver rock impresario Barry Fey, hired by Denver Symphony musicians to help 
them set up a new orchestra, says he has never been to a symphony concert and 
prefers the Beatles over Bach but he's still confident he can do the job. 
Rescuing the financially beleaguered symphony should be "a walk through the 
park" compared to dealing with the super-egos and super-salaries of rock stars, 
he said. After months of uncertainty in the face of a financial crisis for the 
orchestra, the musicians voted to sever their ties with the 55-year-old Denver 
Symphony Assn. and band together under the banner of the Colorado Symphony 
Orchestra. Part of Fey's low-overhead plan would pay each musician about 
$22,000 a year, reportedly twice the figure offered by the Denver Symphony 
Assn. Fey said he would leave it to the musicians to choose conductors and 
music for a proposed 26-week season starting about Nov. 1. ALEENE MacMINN

"Miss Saigon," an updated version of Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" set in 
Vietnam as the Americans are fleeing Saigon, opens at London's Theatre Royal 
Drury Lane on Wednesday. It's the new show from the French team that reworked 
Victor Hugo into the theatrical hit "Les Miserables," librettist Alain Boublil 
and composer Claude-Michel Schonberg. Comforted by a hefty $7.5-million advance 
sale, Boublil and Schonberg now await the judgment of the critics. "Naturally, 
we are nervous," Schonberg confesses. "Miss Saigon" marks the first time the 
two have written in English. In the story, "Miss Saigon" is a teen-age 
prostitute who falls in love with an American G.I, has his child, ends up 
working in a Bangkok nightclub and commits suicide to give her son a new life 
in the United States. Lea Salonga, 18, a child star in the Philippines with 
extensive experience in musicals, plays the title role. ALEENE MacMINN

 HALIM OPENS SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To close the first day of activity at the UCLA Piano Festival and Competition, 
Eduardus Halim, a winner of the Young Concert Artists International Auditions, 
made his Southland debut Saturday evening in Schoenberg Hall Auditorium. His 
playing, alas, fell far short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
In the all-Romantic program leaning heavily on transcriptions, the 
Indonesian-born pianist brought splash and glitter but little depth to his 
playing. He over-pedaled almost constantly, and as a result delivered unfocused 
performances almost devoid of detail. While he dispatched an impressive array 
of notes, his playing so lacked clarity that it became the musical equivalent 
of the din at a very large, very loud party. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Halim's playing was loud: The 28-year-old Juilliard graduate did 
display a remarkably wide dynamic range. But there was little shape to his 
playing, and he appeared to have no concept of how to shape a melodic line. 
</P>
<P>
Most successful was Schumann's "Humoreske", Opus 20 (the only 
non-transcription), where Halim capitalized on the work's myriad contrasts. His 
playing, however, exuded no discernible spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
The Liszt transcriptions that made up the second half -- and the encore -- 
received flashy, often bombastic and entirely superficial performances. The 
pianist showed a capacity for fast finger-work, but rhythmic unevenness and 
technical errors detracted. The university's Steinway, moreover, sounded overly 
bright. 
</P>
<P>
Halim opened with murky readings of three Bach/Busoni chorale preludes.TERRY

POP CAPSULES: THIS CAT'S JUST A KITTY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More Josie and the Pussycats than Cat Scratch Fever, the L.A.-based Faster 
Pussycat -- which played at the Palace on Thursday -- is the sort of band your 
9-year-old daughter might like: a mop-headed, neo-hard-rock quintet of dudes 
who move as if they'd learned to perform by watching Saturday-morning cartoons. 
(If Guns N' Roses had ever made an animated show like KISS, it would have been 
like this, even if Faster Pussycat is cuter.) 
</P>
<P>
The band sounds a little like a trashed-out Sweet, or a heavy-metal version of 
the 1910 Fruit Gum Company. Give 'em points for goofiness, though at one point 
during the sold-out show, unambiguously named lead singer Taime Down said, 
"This has to be one of our best shows ever; we're great up here," which makes 
ironic intent somewhat harder to infer. 
</P>
<P>
The stage set looked like an art director's vision of an arty teen-ager's messy 
room. The chops aren't exactly awe-inspiring -- the dudes spent most of their 
long set staring down at their guitar necks, trying to figure out whether they 
were playing the right chord or not -- not an unattainable goal for pre-teens 
to aspire to. The anti-craftsmanship is kind of punk-rock, which is kind of 
cool. And the winking double-entendres are of the sort a little girl won't pick 
up until junior high, so all the references to cat houses may only be making 
them nostalgic for Hello Kitty. JONATHAN GOLD

JEFFERSON AIRPLANE SPUTTERS, STALLS AND NEVER QUITE SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even during its best moment Saturday night at the Pacific Amphitheatre, the 
Jefferson Airplane inadvertently raised the question of just what it was doing 
out of the hangar after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
"Volunteer for anything you like, volunteer for anything you need," Grace Slick 
urged as she improvised at the end of the strong, hard-driving rendition of 
"Volunteers" that closed an uneven set for the reunited San Francisco band. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the '60s, there was nothing so open-ended about the Airplane's call for 
volunteers. The ideological lines were clearly drawn between generations 
clashing over drug use, the Vietnam War and changing sexual mores, and the 
Jefferson Airplane drew much of its lift and thrust from its role as a musical 
banner waver for the new counterculture. 
</P>
<P>
The Airplane's 2 1/2-hour show Saturday included eight new songs that showed a 
continued willingness to volunteer in service to such old ideals as 
revolutionary change and fear and loathing of conservative political authority. 
</P>
<P>
But neither those nor the older rabble-rousers among the evening's 27 songs 
gave the concert the kind of center and focus that the Airplane automatically 
could draw upon during the turbulent times (1966-71) in which it originally 
flew. 
</P>
<P>
With charged performances, the five veteran Airplane members (augmented by four 
other players) might have been able to compensate for changed times. But the 
times aren't all that have changed. Slick, who will turn 50 next month, 
couldn't approach the vocal clarity and muscularity of her prime in a 
performance strewn with missed notes and wobbly control. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Balin, the Airplane's other main voice, was less diminished, but still 
sounded brittle at times. With Paul Kantner joining in, the Airplane got 
inconsistent results as it tried to recreate its distinctive three-part 
harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a coherent concert structure is admittedly no easy task for a group 
with four lead singers and songwriters and a wide range of styles encompassing 
folk and blues, psychedelic rock and mainstream pop anthems and ballads. 
</P>
<P>
But the Airplane let much of the show progress in mix-and-match fashion, 
leaving potential unities of theme and style unexplored (exceptions were the 
hard-rocking ending and a nicely conceived post-intermission folk-blues segment 
featuring guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bassist Jack Casady). 
</P>
<P>
For all the lesser-known oldies it worked in, the group omitted its most 
famous, most-requested song, the drug anthem, "White Rabbit" (Just saying no 
after all these years? Or, more likely, just acknowledging Slick's vocal 
limitations). 
</P>
<P>
Befitting a San Francisco psychedelic band, the Airplane, which plays Tuesday 
and Wednesday at the Greek Theatre, had an inventive light show featuring 
lovely, colored backdrops and five unusual on-stage pillars that served as 
giant lighting fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
With some creative spark remaining, the '89 model Airplane doesn't quite belong 
in mothballs. But with some misfiring and poorly meshing parts, it fell short 
of a fully satisfying recreation of the powerful, soaring ride of long-ago 
missions flown in cultural combat.

better-known as the singing/songwriting minds behind England's stately pop 
group Squeeze -- proved every charming lil' bit as simultaneously dour, dulcet 
and endlessly self-deprecating as they do on their day jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Along with sparkling renditions of Squeeze's most-beloved material, Saturday's 
hour-long, first-of-two shows at McCabe's ranged from three tunes off the 
group's strong, just-released "Frank" album to a not 'alf bad take on Stick 
McGhee's vintage 1949 kozmik blues "Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee" 
</P>
<P>
Powered by Tilbrook's magnificent, sweet and soulful vocals and Difford's 
vivid, detail-encrusted lyrics, this was POP! music at its finest, never losing 
the ethereal beauty of the melody even when engaging such resolutely earthbound 
subjects as alcoholism ("Labeled With Love") menstruation ("She Doesn't Have To 
Shave"), seaside holidays ("Pulling Mussels From A Shell") and divorce ("Up the 
Junction"). DON WALLER

DIZZY GILLESPIE DOES 'A NIGHT IN HAVANA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS

<TEXT>
<P>
There's an unasked question hovering over Don Holland's "A Night in Havana: 
Dizzy Gillespie in Cuba" (at the Nuart through Tuesday) that casts an 
unfortunate shadow over an otherwise infectious documentary on the great jazz 
trumpeter's 1985 trip to Cuba to headline the fifth International Jazz Festival 
of Havana. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie himself provides the perfect opening for that question when, at the 
beginning of the film, he offers that he is the only member of his contingent 
who feels comfortable visiting Cuba in the light of so much long-held American 
hostility toward Castro. Why didn't off-screen interviewer Allen Honigberg ask 
him why he felt this way? Why didn't Honigberg then proceed to the heart of the 
matter, which would have been to ask Gillespie what he thinks about Cuba's 
sorry history in regard to human rights, and those of minorities in particular. 
The question really is pertinent because Gillespie does bring up the oppression 
of blacks in America and because he is made to look naive when he remarks that 
in contrast to Cuba during the corrupt Batista regime, "Havana now looks so 
peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
You have to believe Dizzy Gillespie is too sophisticated not to know the score 
about the history of freedom of expression under Castro and not to take too 
seriously the dictator's expansive personal welcome. Gillespie in fact emerges 
as an extremely shrewd, warm and wise man who enjoys an enviable harmony with 
himself that is reflected in his wonderfully mellow music. 
</P>
<P>
He is clearly an ambassador of good will par excellence who takes great 
pleasure in connecting with his musical roots, explaining that the drum, which 
is at the heart of African music and culture, was forbidden to slaves in the 
United States while blacks transported to Cuba were allowed to keep theirs. The 
entire film depicts Gillespie enthusiastically making cross-cultural 
connections, bringing pleasure to thousands of Cubans with his music, famed for 
its innovative Afro-Cuban motifs, and discovering in a performance of the 
Folklorico National an exuberant preservation of African traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"A Night in Havana" (Times-rated Family) concludes with Gillespie bringing his 
remarkable band together with that of a contingent of Cuban musicians, 
including pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba. It is a joyous, thrilling synthesis, one 
that Gillespie hoped to repeat in New York only last month. But Rubalcaba and 
his band sadly were denied visas by the State Department.KEVIN THOMAS

SMOKELESS FLYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress has temporarily banned smoking on domestic airline flights lasting two 
hours or less in response to medical evidence that the toxins in tobacco smoke 
harm not just smokers but the people around them, not the least within the 
closed environment of an airliner cabin. But if smoking on short flights is now 
seen as presenting intolerable health dangers to nonsmoking passengers and crew 
members, then smoking on longer flights obviously poses even greater hazards. 
The Senate has now recognized that by voting to forbid smoking on all domestic 
airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the House to go along with this prohibition won't be easy, given the 
influence of the well-financed tobacco lobby. But it shouldn't prove 
impossible, either. The House has already acknowledged the health perils to 
nonsmokers aboard airliners by voting to make permanent the smoking ban on 
shorter flights that is due to expire next February. That must be done, but not 
as a trade-off to banning smoking on longer flights. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear now that the air-filtration systems on passenger planes aren't 
effective in screening out tobacco smoke pollutants. The result is that the 
more than 80% of passengers who are nonsmokers are beset by gaseous poisons. A 
total smoking ban would of course make a cross-country flight uncomfortable for 
smokers. Millions of Americans who are former smokers can feel compassion for 
what they face. But the vast majority of passengers are nonsmokers, and they 
have a right to be protected. The Senate has seen that. The House has no 
rational reason for not doing so as well.

COUNCIL FUNDS FOR SCHOOL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council made a big mistake when it voted to give the Los 
Angeles Unified School District $4.5 million for an after-school recreation 
program for latch-key children. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong; the program reportedly is a fine one. My concern is not 
about the program itself, but how it is being financed. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council took action despite the fact that it has little knowledge 
about the school district's $3.8 billion budget. It's hard for me to believe 
that the district itself could not have spared the money for the program, an 
expense of less than one-tenth of 1% of its total budget. But, nobody took the 
time to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Equally disturbing is the fact that the City Council repeatedly cries poor when 
it comes to funding the services for which it is responsible. We can't spare 
the money to shorten the six-year backlog on tree trimming. We can't spare the 
money to buy more no-parking signs so that street sweepers can do their job, 
and as a consequence, we continue to waste tax dollars sweeping ineffectively. 
Recently, the City Council decided it couldn't spare $3 million to fund a new 
61-officer Police Department foot patrol in high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
City residents and taxpayers are not well served when the mayor and the City 
Council can't find the money for critically needed improvements in city 
services, but blindly fund another jurisdiction's program with no questions 
asked.

BRING BACK THOSE IRA DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic growth is underwritten by savings, and Americans haven't been doing at 
all well when it comes to providing for future growth. A dismally small 
fraction of personal earnings is set aside as savings; for some years now the 
rate has stayed below 5%. What can be done to expand the savings pool and so 
provide more capital for productive investment? One proposal is to discourage 
consumption by putting a special tax on many of the things we buy. An 
alternative approach is to reward savings with tax advantages. The government 
did that earlier this decade by making Individual Retirement Accounts 
tax-deductible for everyone. For many people, though, that advantage 
disappeared with the 1986 tax law. Now there's a proposal to again broaden the 
tax advantages of IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the only people eligible for fully tax deductible IRAs are those 
with incomes under $25,000 ($40,000 for couples) who aren't covered by company 
pension plans. Partial deductibility is allowed for people making up to $35,000 
($50,000 for couples). Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas), chairman of the Finance 
Committee, would let all taxpayers, regardless of income or enrollment in a 
pension plan, contribute up to $2,000 a year to an IRA and avoid current 
taxation on half that sum. In addition, Bentsen would allow penalty-free 
withdrawals from IRAs to finance first-time home purchases and college 
expenses. The cost to the Treasury, he says, would be $1.2 billion in the first 
year of the plan, rising to $4 billion after five years. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a modest loss, but on the other side of the equation offsets could 
be expected. If the economy grows more vigorously than expected because more 
capital becomes available for investment, then government tax revenues would 
rise. If interest rates are nudged down even slightly because the savings pool 
has expanded, the government's debt-servicing costs should fall. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's IRA proposal was conceived as a Democratic alternative to President 
Bush's effort to have capital gains taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 
That idea has attracted some bipartisan support in the House and won narrow 
endorsement from the Ways and Means Committee. It has also come under strong 
attack because most of the tax benefits would go to the well-off. Bentsen's 
plan is, of course, not lacking in political calculation, since its appeal 
would be to the broad middle class, but that doesn't disqualify it. The 
important question is whether increasing the tax advantages of IRAs would spur 
greater savings and so help economic growth. The evidence is that it would. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the last year fully deductible IRAs were available to all workers, the 
accounts drew $38 billion from 15.5 million couples and individuals. In 1987, 
with tax deductibility sharply curtailed, only $14 billion was contributed by 
7.4 million taxpayers. A recent study commissioned by Merrill Lynch Consumer 
Markets concluded that 80% of IRA contributions were "new" money, meaning money 
that wasn't simply transferred from other existing savings. We don't know if 
IRAs are necessarily the best way to encourage greater personal savings. But 
they do seem to be a proven way, and given the compelling need to increase the 
savings rate it seems to us that they're an idea well worth trying again.

Why is it that we consider it our "God"-given right to incarcerate, enslave, 
isolate, torture and kill members of other species simply because we are human 
and they are not, and we can benefit from these practices? ("Man vs. Dog: a 
Bioethical Trade-Off," by Sherwin B. Nuland, Op-Ed Page, Sept. 5). 
</P>
<P>
A "bioethical trade-off"? In whose opinion? What are the lab animals being 
"traded"? There is now ample evidence of animals' sentience, intelligence, 
social skills, power of communication, thinking abilities and emotional life, 
all of which differ from our own only in degree, and in many cases not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Only language separates us, and the ability to create civilizations (which, by 
the way, are responsible for the deterioration of all life on our planet). Is 
that enough to validate our treatment of animals as resources, objects whose 
sole purpose is to further our needs and welfare? Others will no doubt write 
about the vivisecting community's greed and dubious science. 
</P>
<P>
But I, in this letter, wish to raise the fundamental ethical issue: We dominate 
animals and others weaker than ourselves because might makes right, and then 
justify it through religious tenets, anthropocentric philosophy, biased 
morality, and just plain hubris. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it's easier to use live higher organisms than computers in research. 
The Nazis realized that too. They used humans. We condemn that. We can talk. 
Animals can't. I can. I condemn the use of animals.

Nuland is wrong when he says that "all the rights groups exist to stop all 
research on animals." We only want to end those experiments that are fraudulent 
and cause needless suffering and death in animals and humans alike. On second 
thought, Nuland is right. That is all animal research.

RIFT OVER TAX THREATENS UNITY IN SANTA CLARITA; 
</P>
<P>
$275-MILLION ROAD MEASURE RAISES QUESTIONS OF NEED, COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the young city of Santa Clarita are to vote in November on a 
$275-million road tax that could guide transportation planning in the 
burgeoning region for decades. And although the issue is roads, the election 
could provide a barometer of civic unity. 
</P>
<P>
The election will come almost two years to the day after four separate Santa 
Clarita Valley communities -- Newhall, Canyon Country, Valencia and Saugus -- 
voted to band together and become the county's 85th city, culminating a 30-year 
struggle for self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the last election, which showcased civic unity, this election could 
indicate whether competing interests will divide those four communities -- and 
whether similar rifts exist between the city and the unincorporated communities 
that surround it. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is Measure P, an initiative on the Nov. 7 ballot that would raise up 
to $275 million for roads in the Santa Clarita Valley over 40 years. The 
initiative, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage, would raise property 
owners' annual tax bills by $75 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
When the City Council placed Measure P on the ballot, council members said they 
hoped the issue would not pit one community against another. Valencia and 
Newhall, conveniently close to freeways, are known for better planning of 
development and generally suffer fewer traffic problems than Canyon Country and 
Saugus, communities with hodgepodge development and few main arteries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Unity an Issue 
</P>
<P>
Although some residents promise to vote against Measure P simply because they 
oppose new taxes, others say they will not tax themselves to bail out areas far 
removed from their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Valencia, Newhall -- we don't have a problem here," said Tamsie Irvan, a 
Valencia resident. Measure P, she said, will build roads that will pour 
unwanted traffic onto Valencia's well-planned streets. "All they want to do is 
siphon traffic through us." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether appeals for city unity could persuade her to change her mind, 
Irvan replied, "I never go to Canyon Country and I know people there never come 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce in unincorporated Castaic opposes the tax as well. "A 
lot of our money would go to solve their problems," said Dennis Havranek, 
chamber president. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Measure P say that view is shortsighted. Traffic is a valley-wide 
problem, they say, and the tax ultimately will help all motorists in the area. 
The proponents add that Measure P is a quick way to improve movement on the 
clogged system of roads the city inherited from the indifferent and inefficient 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, Measure P would create a giant assessment district, known as a 
Mello-Roos district after the state legislators who wrote the law allowing the 
creation of such districts. In this case, the district would be administered by 
the Santa Clarita Road Financing Authority, a joint agency consisting of Santa 
Clarita and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Quick Fix 
</P>
<P>
The tax would be levied on property roughly lying within the William S. Hart 
Union High School District. The rural community of Val Verde and senior 
citizens would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Garasi, a member of the authority and of the Roads Now Committee, 
frequently quotes a study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments that 
predicts the valley will need $340 million in road improvements to keep traffic 
moving smoothly by 2010. Measure P will not support all of the needed road 
construction projects or solve all the valley's problems, but it will raise 
millions of dollars quickly, Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
Garasi also noted that the entire Santa Clarita Valley was paralyzed last month 
when a tanker truck overturned and blocked the Antelope Valley Freeway, forcing 
traffic onto jammed city streets. "When something like that can shut down our 
valley -- that is scary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Measure P, however, said the measure reneges on pledges by 
cityhood advocates that incorporation would not result in new taxes. Many are 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to get around Proposition 13," said Tom Haner of Canyon 
Country. "The gasoline tax is supposed to build our roads." 
</P>
<P>
If he had known Measure P was in his future, Haner said, he never would have 
voted for cityhood. "I regret it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Haner also said the new roads would only promote more growth, a theory 
challenged by Measure P supporters who say new roads are needed to handle the 
growth that has already occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Other opponents agree that the valley's roads are tired and sick, but question 
whether the road tax is the cure.

<P>
"I'm not opposed to taxes, I know they're inevitable," said Kenneth Dean, an 
unsuccessful City Council candidate two years ago. But Measure P is ill-planned 
and misguided, Dean said. "These are bad taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Dean, Irvan and Haner are members of SMRT -- Stop Mello-Roos Tax, which has 
already launched a campaign against the measure. The members have begun walking 
precincts, handing out flyers, speaking before community groups and are even 
preparing a float denouncing the tax for the annual Frontier Days Parade next 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The float will depict a boat full of valley residents hitting the tip of a tax 
iceberg, suggesting that Measure P is just the first of many taxes residents 
will be asked to pay as the city grows. Haner, the float's driver, plans to 
make the ship and iceberg a familiar sight. "I'm going to be driving that all 
over town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precinct Battle Looms 
</P>
<P>
The Roads Now Committee will not have a float but has begun fund raising and 
has about $3,000 in the bank. Garasi said committee members will also walk 
precincts, speak to civic groups, set up a phone bank and perhaps hire a 
political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But as the campaign heats up, will local interests drive wedges between the 
communities that created the municipal amalgam known as Santa Clarita? 
</P>
<P>
Measure P proponent Garasi and opponent Dean each say no. "I don't think it's 
going to polarize the community," Garasi said. Both men said their campaigns 
will not pit the interests of Valencia and Newhall against those of Saugus and 
Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the fallout from a heated controversy over a bridge construction project 
earlier this year suggests how the Measure P debate could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
In that dispute, many Valencia residents opposed a bridge supported by the 
Circle J residential development in Newhall, saying the bridge would route 
traffic onto Valencia's streets. Circle J residents said the bridge would 
provide a secondary exit out of their secluded community. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council eventually endorsed the bridge, despite warnings from Irvan 
and other Valencia residents that they would retaliate by opposing the road 
tax. Some Circle J residents, saying they wanted to promote the general good of 
the city, pledged to back the tax. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some Circle J residents say they will indeed support Measure P -- but 
quietly. If Circle J gets involved, one resident said, "it may be 
counterproductive. It might serve as a lightning rod for those who are opposed" 
to Measure P and strengthen lingering bitterness over the bridge dispute. 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARITA ROAD TAX INITIATIVE 
</P>
<P>
THE PROBLEM 
</P>
<P>
Various small canyons dividing the Santa Clarita Valley prevent road planners 
from laying out grids of interlocking streets. Transportation planners have 
likened the area's major roads to the fingers of an outstretched hand. Few 
roads connect the fingers, forcing motorists to drive through the palm to get 
to destinations across town or to reach a freeway. The proposed road tax would 
raise $275 million over 40 years. The first phase of construction calls for 
seven projects to be funded entirely or partly by the tax. Future projects 
would be selected by Santa Clarita and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSED SOLUTION 
</P>
<P>
1 Newhall Ranch Road: Construction of a bridge near McBean Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
2 Wiley Canyon Road: Major roadway improvement from Lyons Avenue to Calgrove 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
3 San Fernando Road: Major roadway improvement from Bouquet Canyon Road to 15th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
4 Rio Vista Road: New road from Bouquet Canyon Road to Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
5 Via Princessa: Extension from San Fernando Road eastward to Rainbow Glen. 
</P>
<P>
6 Golden Valley Road: Extension from Antelope Valley Freeway past Soledad 
Canyon Road, intersecting with future California 126. 
</P>
<P>
7 Soledad Canyon Road: Major roadway improvement from Sand Canyon Road to 
Shadow Pines Boulevard.

BATTLE OF THE 'STUCCO MOUNTAINS' HEATS UP; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING NEEDS OUTWEIGH OBJECTIONS TO APARTMENTS, PLANNERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tom Paterson and his neighbors want their corner of North Hollywood to keep a 
low profile -- literally. But in a report released this month, city planners 
indicate that the desperate need for housing in Los Angeles looms larger than 
the homeowners' desire to severely restrict the height of apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the report would have a major impact on the development of 
Paterson's neighborhood of Valley Village, a quiet enclave in the southern 
portion of North Hollywood where four years ago residents began fighting to 
keep tall apartment houses, known locally as "stucco mountains," from 
overshadowing their expensive houses. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners in Valley Village, like those in Van Nuys and elsewhere in the San 
Fernando Valley, have become concerned that the growing number of apartment 
houses is destroying the character of their neighborhood of single-family 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, planners recommended raising the height limits suggested by 
Paterson and other members of a citizens advisory committee who met for nearly 
two years to draw up a special land-use plan for the area. The plan covers a 
one- by 1 1/2-mile area bounded by the Hollywood Freeway on the east, the 
Tujunga Wash next to Coldwater Canyon Avenue on the west, the Ventura Freeway 
on the south and Burbank Boulevard on the north. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Cop-Out' 
</P>
<P>
"They're calling their plan a compromise between us and the developers, but we 
say it's a cop-out," said Paterson, who is president of the Valley Village 
Homeowners Assn. and a 21-year resident of the area. "They're trying to drive 
the middle-class out of Los Angeles, while we're trying to preserve the country 
atmosphere of our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Sutton, the city planner in charge of neighborhood planning, pointed 
out that Valley Village, parts of which are tree-lined and lack sidewalks, is 
only 11 miles from downtown Los Angeles, making it "part of a major 
metropolitan area, not the country" like it might have been 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you can lock the gates of California and say, 'No more people,' then 
you have to provide housing throughout the city, and densities have to be 
higher along major and secondary streets," Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the version of the land-use plan recommended by Sutton and his staff, 
apartment buildings on major streets, such as Riverside Drive, and separated 
from single-family homes by alleys, could be 45 feet tall, or up to five 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments directly adjacent to homes would be restricted to 35 feet, or three 
stories with lofts. Multifamily residences on smaller streets could not be 
higher than 30 feet, or two stories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the citizens advisory group had suggested limiting all apartments 
and condominiums to two stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission is set to review the plan Thursday. If it is approved, 
the plan will be sent to the Planning and Land Use Management Committee for a 
public hearing. The City Council will have the final say over whether it is 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, building in the area is restricted by a temporary ordinance. 
The moratorium in the temporary ordinance, which was approved in November, 
1986, expires later this year, but the City Council can extend it for one year, 
city planner Frank Quon said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance restricts development in several ways, limiting all new buildings 
to two stories and holding the square footage of commercial developments to 1 
1/2 times the size of the lot. Building apartments and condominiums on property 
zoned for commercial use is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expansion Blocked 
</P>
<P>
Fred Russell, a retired movie technician who owns a small apartment house on 
Whitsett Avenue, said the temporary restrictions have prevented him from 
doubling the size of his six-unit building. A resident of the area for most of 
his life, Russell, 75, said he favors the less restrictive, permanent height 
limits set by planners. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeowners on the citizen committee were zero-growth people," Russell 
said. "They should have found out about the zoning before they moved here." 
</P>
<P>
Homes in Valley Village sell for as much as $735,000, with prices starting at 
$350,000, said Karen Hunt, a real estate agent in the area for 16 years. The 
area's architectural mix of traditional, colonial, Tudor, Mediterranean and 
other styles of houses on large lots along tree-lined streets makes it an 
appealing alternative to tract housing and accounts for its popularity, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But houses located next to large apartment houses are selling for as much as 
$50,000 less than others because of the resulting loss of privacy, said Hunt, 
who favors limiting apartment buildings to two stories. 
</P>
<P>
Planners said their recommendations for the area strike a fair balance between 
the interests of homeowners and developers. They said the less restrictive 
height limits will be offset by requiring builders to provide more space 
between their projects and adjoining residential property, and by prohibiting 
open balconies and transparent windows above a height of 26 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, developers will not be allowed, as they have been in the past, to 
use loopholes in the laws to build higher than the 45-foot limit, Sutton said. 
"It will be an absolute limit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1970s, the city has approved 16 special land-use plans, known as 
specific plans, in areas such as Century City and Westwood Village, said Gurdon 
Miller, a city planner in charge of reviewing specific plans. Another 20 or so 
specific plans have been proposed, including the one for Valley Village and for 
five other areas in the Valley, he said. Other areas in the Valley include 
business districts in Van Nuys and Reseda and along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The process of getting a plan approved usually takes at least 28 months, Miller 
said. The City Council must first direct planners to study an area. Then a 
citizens committee appointed by council members who represent the area works 
with city planners to draw up a proposed plan. 
</P>
<P>
Although the process is designed to find out what citizens want, Miller said, 
"The job of the staff is to try to figure out as best as possible what would be 
a reasonable balance between all the interests." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Years' Work 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Valley Village, members of the citizens advisory group met for 
nearly two years before they arrived at a compromise over height limits and 
other aspects of the plan, including requirements for landscaping and setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Why set up a committee that meets every third Monday for years if the city is 
going to go ahead and undermine many of its decisions?" asked Larry 
Blumenstein, an area resident and apartment owner who headed the committee. "I 
think there's something inherently wrong with a system that asks for input and 
then throws it out and does what it wants anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswomen for City Council members Joel Wachs, Zev Yaroslavsky and John 
Ferraro, who represent the area, said the revision of the committee's 
recommendations were unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that there be appropriate buffering between single- and 
multifamily housing," said Vivian Rescalvo, a deputy to Yaroslavsky. "The 
45-foot limit is quite high. It's not acceptable."

An 18-year-old fatally stabbed during a fight along the seawall on Newport 
Avenue in Ocean Beach was identified by police Sunday as Lloyd Gray of Ocean 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that a witness told them that 40 or 50 people were involved in the 
fight that lead to the stabbing. Gray died at 11:26 p.m. Friday, about an hour 
after he was found between two parked cars with a wound to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
No weapon was found at the scene, police said. They are seeking a man, in his 
late 20s or early 30s, about 5-foot-7 and 180 pounds, and with a noticeable 
"beer belly."

A riot at the County Jail in Vista that left two inmates hospitalized "appeared 
to be racially motivated," a San Diego County Sheriff's Department spokesman 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 53 inmates in one module of the jail were injured in the melee which 
broke out about 3:45 p.m. Sunday. Two of the inmates, Elbon Hairston, 27, and 
Gregory Jordan, 36, were taken to a local hospital for treatment. Hairston 
received puncture wounds in his side and back; Jordan suffered a possible 
broken jaw. The remainder of the injured received cuts and bruises and were 
treated at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Scott McClintock said the fighting was caused by a racial flare 
up, reportedly between blacks and Latinos. No deputies were injured in the riot 
which lasted about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock said that the section of the jail where the fight occurred was five 
prisoners under its rated capacity of 58 at the time of the riot.

8 INJURED AS BUS SKIDS ON SLICK FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rash of morning fender benders accompanied early morning showers in San Diego 
Sunday, including an Immigration and Naturalization Service bus which went out 
of control and injured eight. 
</P>
<P>
The bus, loaded with 60 illegal aliens being transported back to Mexico from 
San Clemente, went out of control on Interstate 805 near San Ysidro Boulevard, 
skidded into the center divider and then crossed over four southbound lanes of 
the freeway before coming to rest on the shoulder of the road. 
</P>
<P>
Eight persons, including the bus driver, William Real, 61, and another INS 
officer, were taken to Chula Vista hospitals for treatment. None of the 
injuries was major, a San Diego police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In another South San Diego accident, two San Diego police cars were damaged 
when a truck stopped in front of them at Virginia Avenue and East San Ysidro 
Boulevard. One of the police cars struck the rear of the other, pushing that 
vehicle into the rear of the truck. No one was reported injured in the 
accident, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
A California Highway Patrol spokeswoman said that dozens of minor accidents 
were reported during the morning rain around San Diego County, but no major 
injuries or accidents occurred. She said that the accident rate was normal for 
a rainy day because the pavement becomes slick when the accumulated oil on the 
roadways is brought to the surface by the rain. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered showers brought .40 of an inch of rainfall to Julian, .27 to Ramona 
and .22 to Alpine. Coastal areas reported .10 of an inch or less. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service forecast is for continued breezy, cloudy and cool 
weather with a 30% to 40% chance of showers today.

A synthetic insulating material that is virtually identical to goose down in 
its insulating properties has been developed for the Department of Defense, 
according to chemist James G. Donovan of Albany International Research Co. of 
Mansfield, Mass. The key to the new material, he said, is not the composition 
of the synthetic fibers that constitute it but their size. 
</P>
<P>
The Albany team examined goose down and found that the key characteristic was 
the extremely small size of fibers on the quills. The large number of small 
fibers trap large quantities of air, providing high insulation, while the 
thicker quills provide resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
By producing polyester fibers with a diameter of 7 microns -- about one-quarter 
the size of a human hair and less than half the size of the smallest commercial 
polyester fibers -- Donovan and his colleagues were able to reproduce the 
insulating power of down. Combining these with 20-micron fibers provided 
resiliency. The material costs only "a few dollars per pound," he said, 
compared to $28 to $32 per pound for goose down.

North American forests contain only about one-quarter as much carbon as 
scientists had previously believed, according to new studies by biologist 
Daniel B. Botkin of UC Santa Barbara. If this finding holds true throughout the 
rest of the world, as Botkin believes it will, the discovery could have major 
implications in assessing the role of forests in mitigating potential global 
warming caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Previous estimates indicated that forests contained about the same amount of 
carbon as the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Through extensive sampling, 
however, Botkin and his colleagues found that the North American forests 
contain less than a quarter of the carbon found in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
These results suggest two conclusions, Botkin said: That researchers still have 
a lot to learn about the Earth's carbon cycle, and that planting more trees 
will not be an effective deterrent to global warming.

NUDGE FOR PCBS DEGRADATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Miami Beach.

Environmental scientists at the General Electric Co. reported that they have 
found a way to speed up the degradation of highly toxic polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs) by naturally occurring bacteria that live in the Hudson River 
and other waterways. PCBs were once widely used in capacitors, electrical 
transformers, inks, lubricants and other products until their manufacture and 
use was banned by the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial effluents from GE's manufacture of PCBs heavily contaminated the 
Hudson River in New York, and both GE and the Environmental Protection Agency 
have been searching for ways to clean up the river. Chemist Daniel A. 
Abramowicz of GE's Research and Development Center in Schenectady reported that 
researchers could double the rate at which bacteria from Hudson River sediments 
degrade the PCBs by the simple expedient of giving them a nutrient medium 
containing nitrogen, phosphorus and trace metals. 
</P>
<P>
By varying the relative concentrations of the nutrients and trace metals, 
Abramowicz said, the bacteria can be targeted against any one of the 209 
different PCBs. The researchers hope to begin tests in the river sometime in 
1991.

'REVOLUTIONARY" GAS ADDITIVE

Chemists at the Texaco Research Center in Beacon, N.Y., have developed what 
they call a "revolutionary" new package of engine additives that can clean up 
both the car's carburetor or fuel injection system and interior motor parts 
without increasing the engine's octane requirement. Texaco has recently begun 
marketing the additive package as part of its System-3 gasoline. The additive 
should be particularly useful in small engines and in high-performance engines 
in European luxury cars, according to chemist Rodney Sung of Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
Most gasolines contain organic chemicals that, when heated, can produce 
deposits on metal surfaces. Such deposits in the carburetor and intake valves 
reduce the flow of air and fuel into the engine, thereby degrading 
acceleration, fuel economy, power and cold-start drivability while increasing 
emission of nitrogen oxide pollutants. Most manufacturers put detergents into 
gasoline to clean up these deposits, but the detergents themselves cause 
deposits in the motor's interior, thereby raising the engine's octane 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco's new additive package is unique, Sung said, in that it cleans up both 
intake deposits and interior deposits. Studies on engines in test stands and 
cars show that the additives both prevent buildup of such deposits and remove 
those caused by use of other brands of gasoline, he said.

TOP LAWYERS GET $400 AN HOUR AS FEES, SALARIES RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember when top lawyers charged $100 an hour? Then it went to $200? Well, 
would you believe $400 an hour? 
</P>
<P>
Driven by the spiraling cost of wooing top law school graduates, major law 
firms in Los Angeles and other cities now are charging $350 to $400 an hour -- 
or more -- for the services of their senior partners. 
</P>
<P>
"They're paying more for their (first-year) 'associates' and everything 
ratchets up from there," said Michael Waldorf, a Los Angeles headhunter who 
places lawyers with firms. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries for 25-year-old associates are rising so fast that brochures printed 
for an American Bar Assn. conference last month, which said starting salaries 
in New York City were $76,000, were out of date by the time the conference was 
held. The salaries were already at $82,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles -- and other second-tier legal markets -- they are running at 
$65,000 to $72,000 at the highest-paying firms. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers' fees have been rising steadily at annual rates of 5% to 10% and, 
propelled by rising costs, there is no limit on how high they could go. 
</P>
<P>
"Four hundred dollars isn't a big deal in L.A. for senior lawyers -- or 
anyplace," said John Weil of Altman &amp; Weil, a consulting firm for lawyers. 
"If you go to the top firms and you look at the really top partners, you're 
going to get rates in the $400 to $425 range." 
</P>
<P>
Fees of $350 an hour are relatively commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
"For a top partner . . . we're in the ($350 an hour) range and I'm sure most of 
the people are," said Michael H. Diamond, managing partner for the Los Angeles 
office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, the world's third-largest 
law firm, with more than 1,000 attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The only brake on ever-rising fees in California is a court ruling that says 
lawyers cannot impose charges that "shock the conscience." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very vague standard," said Erica Tabachnick, one of the State Bar 
attorneys charged with enforcing it. A fee "can shock one guy's conscience and 
not another's." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, it is rare for anyone to be disciplined for charging 
unconscionable fees. 
</P>
<P>
All this is seen as wretched excess by some. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge's Pay 
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. District Judge John V. Singleton, after 23 years on the bench in 
Houston, earns $89,500 -- or less than some 26-year-old, second-year associates 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not get as much respect from young lawyers as he once did, and 
he thinks salaries have something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that escalating salaries have had maybe a subliminal impact on young 
lawyers," the judge said. "They think to themselves . . . 'Why in the world 
should I pay a lot of attention to you? I'm making as much or more than you are 
-- you dumb ass!' " 
</P>
<P>
Not all legal services cost this much. Surveys show that senior partners in all 
firms nationwide average $150 an hour. On the Westside of Los Angeles, for 
example, a few family lawyers charge $400 an hour, but hourly fees for most 
legal problems typically run from $150 to $250. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many lawyers take cases on contingency -- charging only if they 
win. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate clients rarely complain about what senior partners charge because 
these lawyers tend to work fast and give good advice, analysts say. But clients 
are driven mad by hefty bills for the slower and less sophisticated work of 
gangs of inexperienced associates. 
</P>
<P>
Young lawyers typically remain associates for 7 to 10 years. At first, they 
help the partners by doing grunt work, then graduate to more responsible tasks, 
then are typically made partners themselves or asked to leave. 
</P>
<P>
In large firms, it is standard to bill clients for the work of the youngest 
associates at rates ranging from $75 to $95 per hour, and some firms are 
billing at $110 an hour or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything above $95 for a low associate I think is outrageous," said Larry 
Smith, managing editor of the trade publication Of Counsel. "The client has 
absolutely no assurance that the person billing at that rate merits that 
amount. . . . He got here yesterday. I think he knows where the courthouse is, 
and I think he knows what the tax rates are." 
</P>
<P>
But firms want to bill as much as they can for their associates, because 
associates are the partners' profit centers. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, law firms have maintained ratios of three associates to one 
partner -- with the higher-paid partners using associates to generate a high 
number of "billable hours." 
</P>
<P>
Partners at the country's six most-profitable firms now earn in excess of $1 
million a year, according to a recent survey by the American Lawyer magazine. 
At Los Angeles' most profitable firm, Latham &amp; Watkins, profits-per-partner 
average $645,000, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, law firms reap their largest rewards by billing according to the 
results they achieve, rather than the hours they work. This method is typically 
used when stakes to corporate clients are particularly high. 
</P>
<P>
"Clients will say, 'If I'm being sued for dumping toxic wastes, or I'm the 
object of a hostile takeover, I don't care what it costs to pay the lawyer. I 
just need to get out of this problem,' " said Lawrence Bright, vice president 
of Hildebrandt Inc., a consulting firm for lawyers and the corporations that 
use them. 
</P>
<P>
In a classic example, New York's Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz last fall 
charged Kraft Inc. a reported $20 million for two weeks' work. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal translated that to $5,000 an hour for each of the 
couple of dozen lawyers on the case, assuming that each worked around the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers have said that their fee, under the circumstances, was cheap. 
Representing Kraft while it was being taken over by Philip Morris Cos., they 
pried out of Philip Morris an extra $2 billion for their client. 
</P>
<P>
Work on mergers and acquisitions requires lots of hardy bodies with sharp 
minds. Wall Street law firms that specialize in it are among the fiercest in 
recruiting new law school graduates. They are looking for people who will drop 
everything to focus on a client's pressing problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of takeover work requires lots and lots of bright people who can 
manage stress and and work at speed," said Dennis J. Block, a partner at New 
York's 508-lawyer Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges. 
</P>
<P>
To handle it, Block said his firm tries to recruit at least 60 new law school 
graduates a year. 
</P>
<P>
The process of wooing them begins long before they graduate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Summer Work 
</P>
<P>
"We have a summer program in which we hire . . . 60 to 70 second-year 
students," Block said. "And we pay them something like $1,500 per week." 
</P>
<P>
But rather than put them to work, the law firm treats the youngsters like 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, it shows them depositions and hearings, and allows them to 
observe deals being negotiated. In the evenings, Block said, "buses leave for 
the movie, the show, the baseball game, the picnic, the museum or . . . 
whatever the evening entertainment (is that) we're providing." 
</P>
<P>
Top firms in Los Angeles and other cities run similar programs, in which they 
compete with the Wall Street firms for the small pool of graduates from top law 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
One side effect of the competition is that it is getting easier for students 
with relatively poor grades to get lucrative jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you happen to be at the right schools, and if you have either good grades 
or good interpersonal skills, it's a remarkably easy path," Yale Law School 
associate dean Stephen Yandle told the recent American Bar Assn. conference. 
"Sometimes law firms don't even look at grades when recruiting for summer 
clerkships. . . . If you do well as a clerk, no one may look at your grades."

BEST-SUPPORTING ACTOR HONORS GO TO HARRELSON, PERLMAN FOR COMEDY AND MAYRON FOR 
DRAMA

<P>
ABC's "thirtysomething" and NBC's "Cheers" each picked up two quick awards as 
the 41st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards got under way Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Woody Harrelson and Rhea Perlman of NBC's "Cheers" were honored as best 
supporting actor and actress in a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"thirtysomething," last year's top drama series and nominated for 13 awards 
this year, won Emmys for best supporting actress in a drama -- Melanie Mayron 
-- and writing. 
</P>
<P>
Best supporting actor in a drama went to Larry Drake of NBC's "L.A. Law," which 
was the top-honored drama series with 17 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
In all, NBC, which has dominated the Emmy nominations for the last six years, 
led with 103 nominations, trailed by CBS' 95 and ABC' 85. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies were televised from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium by Fox 
Broadcasting Co., Channel 11 locally, in the United States and on a live or 
taped basis to 21 other countries, reaching a foreign audience of about 300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Emmy hopes hung on the surprisingly popular "Lonesome Dove," based on 
Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about an aging cowboy. The 
miniseries earned 18 nominations -- including acting honors for stars Robert 
Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Diane Lane and Anjelica Huston. 
</P>
<P>
At the non-televised portion of the awards held Saturday, "Lonesome Dove" 
earned six craft Emmys, including honors for costumes, makeup, music and sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy Brown," the most-honored new series with 11 nominations, won two of 
CBS' 21 non-televised awards Saturday. NBC trailed with 13 Emmys and PBS and 
ABC picked up seven each. 
</P>
<P>
To win best actor in a miniseries or special, Duvall and Jones had to out-duel 
John Gielgud, nominated for his performance in ABC's "War and Remembrance," 
which was up for 15 awards. The nod also could go to James Woods for his 
performance in the "Hallmark Hall of Fame" special "My name is Bill W." about 
the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. It was nominated seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Lane and Huston competed against Amy Madigan and Holly Hunter, of "Roe vs. 
Wade," and Jane Seymour of "War and Remembrance." 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "The Wonder Years," 1988's top comedy and the recipient of 14 nominations 
this year, was slated to match wits with NBC's "Cheers" and "The Golden Girls" 
and CBS' "Designing Women" and "Murphy Brown," the most-honored new series with 
11 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "thirtysomething" defended its 1988 best drama series crown against "L.A. 
Law," network mate "China Beach," and CBS' "Beauty and the Beast" and 
"Wiseguy." 
</P>
<P>
The trio of "Golden Girls" -- Betty White, Rue McClanahan and last year's 
Emmy-winner Beatrice Arthur -- vied for top comedy actress with Candice Bergen 
of "Murphy Brown" and Blair Brown of "Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," which was 
reborn on Lifetime cable after being dropped by NBC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Win 
</P>
<P>
Ted Danson of "Cheers," nominated six times previously without a win, hoped No. 
7 would be magic but faced stiff competition from 1988 comedy actor winner 
Michael J. Fox of "Family Ties" along with "Empty Nest's" Richard Mulligan, 
"Roseanne's" John Goodman and newcomer Fred Savage of "The Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
In the dramatic actor category, Michael Tucker of "L.A. Law" went up against 
Ron Perlman of "Beauty and the Beast," Edward Woodward of "The Equalizer," 
Carroll O'Conner of "In the Heat of the Night" and Ken Wahl, "Wiseguy." 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. Law" co-stars Susan Dey and Jill Eikenberry, "Beauty and the Beast's" 
Linda Hamilton, "China Beach's" Dana Delany and "Murder She Wrote's" Angela 
Lansbury were up for best actress in a drama series. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences planned to hand out 28 primetime 
awards Sunday for the period June 1, 1988, to May 31, 1989. Presenters included 
Duvall, Bob Hope, Arsenio Hall, Jimmy Smits, Angela Lansbury and Kermit the 
Frog. 
</P>
<P>
Hope was to present the prestigious Governor's Award posthumously to comedienne 
Lucille Ball. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four other awards, most for technical achievement, were handed out 
Saturday at the non-televised portion. 
</P>
<P>
PBS was up for 32 awards, mostly for arts or science programming. Fox 
Broadcasting received 12 nominations, 10 of them for "The Tracey Ullman Show," 
including top variety program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HBO Leads Cable 
</P>
<P>
HBO was tops in the cable categories with eight nominations, trailed by the 
Disney Channel and MTV with a pair each, and Lifetime, TBS, TNT and USA with 
one apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's televised spectacle marked the end of a 3-year contract between 
the Television Academy and newcomer Fox. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 show was a ratings disaster. Last year's Nielsens showed improvement, 
but still embarrassed academy officials. 
</P>
<P>
"This year should be much better," predicted John Moffit, co-executive producer 
of the telecast. "Fox has been very strong on Sunday night." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's ratings showed Fox's "Married . . . with Children" in the 17th 
position and "Totally Hidden Video" in 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, the academy and the producers also sent letters to, and called, the 
nominees to try to prevent a repeat of 1988's parade of no-shows. Last year's 
"designated accepter," Tony Danza, came to the stage so many times he finally 
exclaimed, "What's the matter with you people? Where are you?" 
</P>
<P>
Production designers Moffit and Pat Tourk Lee strove for a new look and a 
tighter show. Gone were the meaningless production numbers and the endless 
number of nominee clips. But Moffit admitted that certain elements cannot be 
regulated, particularly the acceptance speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"We urged the nominees to be scintillating and succinct in their acceptances," 
said the veteran producer-director. "You always hope for that spontaneous 
reaction, like when Alan Alda won a writing award and did a cartwheel on his 
way to the stage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right of First Refusal 
</P>
<P>
There was hope among academy executives that the Emmycast would return to one 
of the three major networks for a ratings rejuvenation next year when bidding 
reopens. However, Fox has the right of first refusal before ABC, CBS, NBC and 
others can enter the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Emmy ratings plummeted while on Fox was that the young network's 
coverage of the country is far less than that of the big three networks. Many 
TV academy officials think their annual Emmy show deserves broader exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Strong counter-programming was the rule of thumb Sunday night on the three 
major networks. ABC scheduled the Jack Nicholson-Kathleen Turner hit movie 
"Prizzi's Honor." CBS scheduled a preview of its new fall shows and the Steve 
Martin-Daryl Hannah film comedy "Roxanne." NBC struck back with reruns of the 
"Family Ties" finale and "Bionic Showdown."

AUSCHWITZ: JEWS, POLES DIFFER ON ITS PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE

OSWIECIM, Poland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the Polish tourists glanced a few yards to their left as they emerged 
from the "Block of Death" where special prisoners of Auschwitz once awaited 
execution. There, past the barbed wire and the watchtower, on the other side of 
a 12-foot concrete wall, they could see the upper floors of a recently 
refurbished, four-story brick building and, next to it, the top of a large 
wooden cross. 
</P>
<P>
"That building houses the Carmelite cloister that the church authorities are 
fighting for," said their tour guide. 
</P>
<P>
That remark triggered much angry murmuring among the seemingly passive Poles. 
"This is our country!" grumbled one. "Poles were also murdered here!" a second 
said. "It's not right that they should be protesting!" declared a third. 
</P>
<P>
"They" are the Jews who view a Roman Catholic convent at the site of Nazi 
Germany's most infamous World War II death camp as a religious desecration and 
an assault on the memory of their unique suffering as the target of the most 
brutally systematic attempt at genocide in recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials in this predominantly Roman Catholic country have unilaterally 
suspended an earlier agreement with world Jewish leaders to move the 
five-year-old convent to a planned interfaith center to be located farther from 
the Auschwitz site. They said they did so because of what they assert were the 
agreement's "unrealistic" terms and "aggressive" actions on the Jewish side. 
</P>
<P>
There were indications over the weekend that some compromise may be in the 
offing to defuse what has proved to be an explosive and acutely embarrassing 
squabble for a Polish nation that is elsewhere basking in Western admiration 
for installing Eastern Europe's first non-Communist government in more than 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But as the comments by the Polish tourists suggest, here at Oswiecim -- as the 
town and camp are called in the Polish language -- it looks as if no matter 
what is finally decided, divisions will remain between the Polish and Jewish 
understanding of each other on the matter of Nazi atrocities inflicted on both 
peoples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Enormous Evil 
</P>
<P>
As enormous as is the evil that Auschwitz represents, it is as if it is still 
not big enough for Poles and Jews to share. 
</P>
<P>
Both peoples see Auschwitz and the adjacent death camp known as Birkenau as 
monuments to unfathomable hatred and cruelty. But for Poles, it is a national 
memorial to extraordinary wartime suffering little appreciated by the outside 
world; a reminder of a conflict that not only laid waste to their country and 
killed millions of its non-Jewish citizens, but which then handed them over to 
the domination of another alien power, the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
To Jews, Auschwitz is a symbol that transcends war and nationhood. It 
represents the culmination of 2,000 years of irrational persecution and 
contempt by a Christian world which accused an entire people of deicide. And 
any action seen as diluting this central theme is considered unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
"The state museum of Oswiecim-Brzezinka is a monument of the martyrdom and 
struggle of the Polish and other nations," according to a sign at the entrance 
to the complex that employs the Polish names for the two camps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Hebrew Version 
</P>
<P>
There is no special mention of the Jews, who numbered at least 2.5 million of 
the 4 million murdered here. And while the sign is translated into several 
languages, including Italian, Danish, German, and Russian, there is no Hebrew 
version. 
</P>
<P>
Through the end of last year, more than 19 million people had visited the 
museum since its opening in 1947. While many of the nearly 4 million foreign 
visitors have been Jewish, the great majority who come here are Polish 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
One of about 200 groups that came this past weekend was on a pilgrimage 
organized by a parish church in the Poznan area. Auschwitz was one of several 
stops on a three-day tour that also included Poland's holiest shrine at 
Czestochowa, the former home of Polish kings at Krakow and the birthplace of 
Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if I'm going through the occupation again," said Lucja Mikula, 67, who 
was here for the first time. "The young people don't know," she added as she 
began to weep. "But we remember it. We lived through it. I worked five years 
(as a forced laborer) for the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
Polska Lucyna, 63, from the same tour group reached behind her neck and also 
started to cry. "The pain, here," she explained as she recalled her arrest 
during the occupation. "I feel they are beating me again." 
</P>
<P>
Several Poles stayed outside while their groups entered Block 11 -- the 
so-called Block of Death. "I can't go in," said Kristin Wielgosz, 52. "I don't 
want to go through the experience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everybody Should Come' 
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Skowronski, who was a wartime courier in the Polish underground, said 
he has visited Auschwitz many times from his home in Rabka, near Krakow, often 
escorting family and friends from abroad. "I think everybody should come here 
and experience this in his own way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He knew many who died at Auschwitz, Skowronski added -- "Poles. And Jews as 
well." And he sighed audibly when asked about the controversy over the 
Carmelite convent. "I think it's totally unnecessary," he finally said. "My 
personal opinion is that whoever prays here, it won't hurt those who died 
here." He blamed "groups who come here shouting and screaming" for whipping up 
trouble. "It's out of place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rabka man was alluding to a group of American Jews who trespassed on 
convent grounds in mid-July to protest the failure of the Polish church to live 
up to a 1987 agreement meant to resolve the issue. The nuns were supposed to 
have been moved to a new interfaith prayer center by last Feb. 22 under that 
agreement, but so far, no work on such a center has even begun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doused With Water 
</P>
<P>
The protesting Americans were forcibly ejected by Polish workmen who roughed 
them up and doused them with water in an ugly scene captured by television 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, the Polish cardinal who 
helped negotiate the 1987 accord, said that he was suspending it because of 
"aggressive" demands and protests of Jewish activists. 
</P>
<P>
Then, three weeks ago, the Polish primate, Cardinal Josef Glemp, voiced during 
a sermon what apparently were extemporaneous remarks in which he alluded to 
alleged Jewish control of the media and a Jewish role in spreading communism. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp asserted that anti-Semitism in Poland would disappear if Jews would cease 
anti-Polish remarks and actions. And regarding the convent, he said: "Dear 
Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation elevated over all others 
and do not put to us conditions which are impossible to meet." 
</P>
<P>
The primate's remarks angered Jews further and shocked many non-Jewish 
observers as well. A trip he was scheduled to make to the United States later 
this month was canceled because of "circumstances not favorable" for his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is Polish-born, said that Glemp's 
remarks were indicative of a national anti-Semitism that Poles "suck in with 
their mother's milk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Our Own Stupidity' 
</P>
<P>
Adam Michnik, a deputy in the Polish Parliament who had earlier condemned 
Glemp's statement, was equally incensed by Shamir's, calling it "absurd" and 
"an offense to all Poles. . . . Let us remember that no hatred -- be it 
anti-Semitism or 'anti-Polandism' -- can be 'sucked in with mother's milk.' 
Hatred is always a product of our own stupidity and immorality." 
</P>
<P>
Glemp met over the weekend with Zygmunt Nissenbaum, the head of a family fund 
that restores Jewish monuments in Poland, and according to the official PAP 
news agency, "a draft of a satisfying solution of the Auschwitz conflict was 
shaped." 
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports, Nissenbaum will help finance the proposed 
interfaith prayer center, where the convent would be located, a distance away 
from the Auschwitz camp.

100,000 HOLD MASS IN UKRAINE; 
</P>
<P>
RALLY FOR OUTLAWED CHURCH MARKS 50TH YEAR OF ANNEXATION 
</P>

LVOV, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outlawed Ukrainian Catholic Church demonstrated its massive power here 
Sunday as tens of thousands of worshipers knelt on the ground and prayed in an 
outdoor service and then spilled onto the main avenues, singing hymns and 
holding lighted candles. 
</P>
<P>
The Mass and a subsequent march to the central cathedral, in which more than 
100,000 people took part, was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the Soviet 
annexation of Western Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate demonstration Sunday evening, about 30,000 Ukrainians, many 
dressed in black, ringed the central square across from the Opera Theater, lit 
candles and observed 30 minutes of silence in memory of the victims of Soviet 
dictator Josef Stalin's repression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Candles in Windows 
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday night, apartments through Lvov went dark at precisely 10 o'clock 
as residents in unison switched off their electricity and put candles in their 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians were jailed, executed or sent into exile 
during Stalin's rule. 
</P>
<P>
In this city where religion and nationalism are intertwined, demonstrators 
cited dual aims: to demand that Moscow legalize the Eastern-rite Ukrainian 
Catholic Church and that the citizens be given greater freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour Mass, held in a central park with worshipers standing 
shoulder-to-shoulder beneath a canopy of chestnut trees, was for many an 
emotionally charged event. 
</P>
<P>
"We never expected such a miracle would happen to us," 67-year-old Maria 
Laskeuv said with tears in her eyes as the service ended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Had to Pray in Homes' 
</P>
<P>
"For years we had to pray in our homes like mice," said Laskeuv, who served 11 
years in a labor camp from 1944 to 1955 for religious and political activism. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, at last, we are out in the open," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The service was attended by entire families. People openly wore crosses on 
their chests, saying "Hallelujah," and held icons depicting Jesus and Mary. 
They swayed back and forth, singing and praying. "Freedom for the Catholic 
Church," read a sign held by one man. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest show of force ever by the Ukrainian Catholic Church in this 
officially atheistic country. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Hel, a church activist who spent 18 years in prison for his religious 
beliefs, estimated the crowd size for the afternoon procession at 150,000 to 
200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"But the numbers don't matter very much," he said. "This is a moral victory. 
Look at how powerful our church is. We've waited a long time for this, and now 
our time has come." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4 million believers in the Ukraine are members of the Ukrainian 
Catholic Church. In the late 1940s, Stalin knew he could not kill religion in 
the Ukraine entirely, but he repressed the Catholic Church because it looked to 
Rome for direction. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, Soviet authorities accused the Catholic Church of widespread 
collaboration with the Nazis. All the Catholic cathedrals were taken over by 
the Russian Orthodox Church. Many of those who resisted the changeover were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"Until just two years ago, believers prayed in homes, in the woods, even in the 
cemetery, trying to dodge the KGB," Hel said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Ukrainian Catholic Church is still legally banned and thus has no 
cathedrals, officials over the last two years have tolerated services held 
outdoors, sometimes even next to churches that were confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's service also was held with permission of local authorities, but only 
on condition that the speeches and songs be of a religious -- and not a 
nationalist -- nature. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, more than 300 yellow and blue Ukrainian flags, once strictly 
banned as being anti-Soviet, were hoisted above the heads of a wave of people 
walking to St. Yuri's Cathedral, and many of the worshipers wore yellow and 
blue armbands. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, you could have gotten 25 years for wearing such an armband," said 
Peter V. Kohan, 53, who spent two years in exile in Siberia in the 1950s for 
Ukrainian nationalist activities. 
</P>
<P>
Kohan, a retired teacher, said that although only religious hymns were sung 
during the march, the radio began playing nationalist songs first thing in the 
morning, including some that had not been heard on radio since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I both cried," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen police officers monitored the worshipers along the three-mile 
route they followed after the service on their way to St. Yuri's, the city's 
largest Ukrainian-language Russian Orthodox church. 
</P>
<P>
Police also stood guard during the candle-lighting ceremony in the central 
square. But they were armed only with bullhorns and did not intervene in the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Leaders Assailed 
</P>
<P>
In the square, flowers were scattered and a poster referred to former Soviet 
leaders as "despots of the 20th Century who brought the population of the 
U.S.S.R. to a spiritual, economic, and political crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities in the Ukraine have demonstrated increasing tolerance 
toward religion and nationalism, some protesters gathered in the square 
contended that repressions continue. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a week ago, two policemen beat me because I raised the Ukrainian flag," 
said Orest F. Karelin, a 42-year-old nationalist activist who showed a reporter 
a cut on his thumb. 
</P>
<P>
Karelin is a member of a radical nationalist group, the Ukrainian Helsinki 
Assn., which called for outright secession from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But spirituality was the main theme of the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been struggling for a long time to get our church legalized," said a 
33-year-old factory worker who would give only his first name, Ivan. "This can 
be considered the peak of our struggle. We want Moscow to acknowledge our right 
to pray in our own way, in our own churches, without fear."

In Moscow, the Supreme Soviet has drafted a decree that will give amnesty to 
Soviet soldiers who were taken prisoner during the war in Afghanistan, the 
government newspaper Izvestia reported. The amnesty also will offer a chance to 
return home to soldiers who fled service in Afghanistan and ended up in the 
United States and Canada, the newspaper said. Izvestia did not give any 
numbers, but the Soviets officially list 311 soldiers as missing in action in 
Afghanistan. The Soviet Union fought for nine years in Afghanistan, withdrawing 
the last of its estimated 115,000 soldiers last February.

A man and woman were killed when their twin-engine Cessna aircraft crashed in 
steep terrain in the Cajon Pass, San Bernardino County authorities said. The 
unidentified couple were killed instantly when their Cessna 310-I burst into 
flames when it crashed in the mountains about five miles south of Hesperia near 
Interstate 15, Sheriff's Deputy James Carney said. A passing motorist saw the 
flames and notified deputies. It was not immediately known from where the plane 
had taken off or where it was headed, FAA spokesman Jerry Acosta said.

Afghan President Najibullah asserted that U.S. officials are trying to bolster 
their aid to anti-Communist rebels by meeting with deposed Afghan King Mohammed 
Zahir Shah in Italy. However, radical Afghan guerrillas with bases in Pakistan 
threatened to assassinate the former monarch if he tries to return and head a 
postwar government in Kabul. The warring sides in Afghan's civil war commented 
after reports that a U.S. envoy met with the exiled king in Rome. After months 
of trying to forge unity within the guerrilla coalition, Washington reportedly 
is considering alternatives. But the rebels are split over a possible role for 
the 74-year-old king.

Coast Guard personnel and others rescued at least nine kayak riders who were 
dumped into chilly, rain-swept San Francisco Bay after their Polynesian-type 
outrigger boats swamped during a race, Golden Gate National Recreation Area 
police reported. A spokesperson said at least two of the outriggers racing from 
Sausalito and around Alcatraz "cut it too close" to the island in the middle of 
the bay and swamped, and that the riders were helped or made it themselves to 
Alcatraz where they were picked up. Ian Wilson of Sea Trek Ocean Kayaking 
Center was quoted as saying one boat filled with water during the paddle, but 
the center declined later to give details of the incident. An original report 
indicated about 25 people were involved in the ditching.

The incidence of drug abuse during pregnancy among middle- and upper-income 
women may be widely underestimated, according to a study released at a national 
conference on drug abuse and parenting in Miami. Many reports have suggested 
the problem is largely confined to poor, urban minority groups. But a study of 
715 women who received prenatal care at various public health clinics and 
private practices in Pinellas County, Fla., during the first six months of this 
year found no significant difference in the rate of drug use during pregnancy 
among women at the public clinics that serve a largely indigent population and 
those visiting private doctors who cater to upper-income patients.

Five South Americans arrested in Canada last week were planning to help two 
accused Colombian drug smugglers break out of jail in Fredericton, New 
Brunswick, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Inspector Al 
Hutchinson said the men will appear in court early this week to be charged. 
Four of the men were seized Wednesday in the Atlantic province, along with an 
arsenal of weapons. The fifth was caught Thursday in Saint John, New Brunswick. 
Hutchinson said the men were trying to free two Colombians who were arrested in 
April after police seized 1,100 pounds of cocaine stashed in a small airplane 
that crash-landed at a private airstrip near Fredericton.

Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, leading pleas by leaders of the legal 
profession for action on the drug problem, called Sunday for more courts and 
judges to handle a soaring increase in drug-related cases that threatens to 
clog the California judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, appearing at the annual meeting of the State Bar of California, called 
President Bush's drug program "laudable," but noted that efforts to arrest more 
drug dealers inevitably would lead to greater reliance on the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"One expected result, of course, is more convictions, but there has been little 
provision or discussion of the need for more judges and courtrooms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asks for More Resources 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that only 1.5% of all state and local budgets are devoted to 
judicial operations, Lucas urged that "additional resources" be devoted to the 
courts to assure prompt resolution of both criminal and civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' call, issued in his annual State of the Judiciary address, followed a 
dramatic plea by a Los Angeles judge for concerted action by the legal 
profession to help the courts deal with the impact of cocaine and other illegal 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Candace D. Cooper, president of the California Judges 
Assn., said that criminal cases in downtown Los Angeles courts had increased 
from 7,684 in 1981 to 16,965 in 1988, with a "substantial majority" of the 
increase attributable to drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
On another front, she said, the number of murder cases in that area -- many of 
which involve drugs -- was up 43% in the first seven months of 1989 over the 
same period last year. At any one time, half or more of the trial judges are 
involved in murder proceedings, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"These cases are overwhelming the criminal justice system," Cooper said. If 
judges are forced to work at an even faster pace, she said, "we're going to 
sound like a chorus of Alvin and the Chipmunks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Reform Urged 
</P>
<P>
Cooper also made an appeal for personal reform within the judicial profession. 
"If you are a recreational user of cocaine, quit," she said. "If you have a 
more serious problem, seek some assistance. If you know others in that status, 
work with them as their friend." 
</P>
<P>
The speech drew a warm response from the hundreds of assembled delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas later diverted from his own prepared remarks to praise Cooper. "I want to 
say amen and right on to everything she said," the chief justice said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over drugs was also a dominant theme in a speech by Los Angeles 
attorney Alan I. Rothenberg, the incoming president of the State Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg said the courts are "overwhelmed" by criminal cases, largely as the 
result of increased drug-trafficking, and that the civil justice system "is 
teetering on the brink of collapse." 
</P>
<P>
He pledged a wide-ranging inquiry into ways to ease court congestion and impose 
other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Among questions to be studied, he said, are whether to decrease the size of 
juries, limit pretrial questioning of prospective jurors by attorneys and 
eliminate preliminary hearings or merge them with arraignments. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg also said he would create a special Bar task force to study 
substance abuse within the profession. Among other things, it will create model 
programs for law firms, legal departments and other groups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Lucas said there was an urgent need for education, prevention 
and treatment programs to combat drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"Courts alone cannot stem the tide," he said. "Increased reliance and pressure 
on the courts to handle the drug problem without affording adequate resources 
to do the job or address the root causes for this pervasive intruder in our 
society can harm our entire legal system." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racial, Ethnic Bias Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, in his capacity as head of the state Judicial Council, also said he 
would create an advisory committee to study bias against racial and ethnic 
minorities in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to California's changing ethnic mix, Lucas said the committee would 
"consider how best to deal with any problems that may already exist and to meet 
additional challenges that are sure to develop in the future." 
</P>
<P>
A similar committee already has been at work on a study of sex bias in the 
courts.

COMMUNITY AT LOGGERHEADS OVER A BOOK BY DR. SEUSS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a little tale about trees that's quickly become required reading all 
across timber-laden Mendocino County -- not just in the classroom, but in the 
coffee shops and service station waiting rooms as well. 
</P>
<P>
It's not about the stately redwood, the towering symbol of a once-thriving 
economy in this depressed lumber town of about 900 residents -- a place without 
even one traffic light, a mere eyeblink along U.S. 101, about 150 miles north 
of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The fascination is with the bright-colored Truffula trees, the imaginary plants 
that play a major role in "The Lorax," a 1971 book by Dr. Seuss, the children's 
author from La Jolla who for decades has charmed young readers with his rhyming 
whimsy about green eggs and ham and cats with hats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Run on 'The Lorax' 
</P>
<P>
Folks here say you can't find the book anywhere within 100 miles, that you have 
to drive clear up to Eureka to find a bookstore that hasn't already been 
cleaned out. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a run on 'The Lorax' all across the county, that's certainly safe 
to say," said Marianne Loeser, president of the Long Valley teachers' 
association in Laytonville. 
</P>
<P>
The critical reviews started this fall when two prominent logging families 
complained that the book -- which for a year has been required reading for 
second-graders in the 570-student Laytonville Unified School District -- was a 
thinly veiled attack on the lumber industry. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, a mossy, mole-like creature named a Lorax fights a fruitless 
battle against the ax-wielding, water-fouling Once-ler family, which wreaks 
environmental havoc on a make-believe forest by greedily harvesting all of its 
Truffula trees to make a multipurpose stocking called a Thneed. 
</P>
<P>
The fuzzy-headed Lorax suddenly disappears, presumably at the hand of greed, 
after the Once-lers -- "with a sickening smack of an ax on a tree" -- cut down 
the last Truffula. The book ends, however, on an upbeat note as the remaining 
Once-ler asks that a seed from the last tree be planted and raised with care. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, after several children came home from school to question their 
parents' lumber industry jobs, a campaign began to buzz-saw the book from the 
required reading list -- instead making it alternative reading. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a specially appointed review committee voted 6 to 1 last week to 
keep the book on the second-grade core list, "The Lorax" isn't out of the woods 
just yet. Logging advocates say they will appeal the issue to the school board, 
which meets next month. 
</P>
<P>
"To teach this book is insensitive to us as pillars of the community," said 
63-year-old Bud Harwood, whose family owned logging company in nearby Branscomb 
employs about 300 people, making it by far the area's biggest employer. "In our 
eyes, it's an attack on the integrity of our industry. It's not justified to 
have kids come home and tell their parents they're working in a bad industry, 
that they're criminals because they take the homes away from little animals." 
</P>
<P>
Without the controversy, teachers say, the book might well have been removed 
from the list soon enough. But now the issue borders on censorship, they say. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute reflects tension that has been building in the community for months 
-- even years -- residents say. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the most recent haggling is the resentment felt by many logging 
families, which have lived quietly here for generations, against the often 
college-educated outsiders from San Francisco and Southern California who have 
invaded the region in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the kids have been dragged into it," said one coffee shop waitress who 
teaches dance part-time. "One little girl came up to me recently and said 
'Teacher, are you for the loggers or the hippies?' 
</P>
<P>
"They've taught their children that anyone with an environmentalist stand is a 
hippie. They even sponsored a campaign recently to tie a yellow ribbon on your 
car to show your support of the logging industry." 
</P>
<P>
A three-hour drive north of San Francisco, Laytonville is more than a million 
miles away from the big city in character and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
It's a place where country music blares over the radio waves, where the locals 
post signs in the middle of town congratulating couples on their latest child, 
no last names needed. 
</P>
<P>
The town sits on the southern face of the Redwood Wall -- named for the tree 
that for decades has provided the area not only with an economic base, but an 
emotional cushion from the noise and pollution of the rest of California. 
</P>
<P>
In Laytonville, the redwood is king. Symbols of the tree are everywhere. Locals 
call the surrounding region, "The Redwood Empire" and the stretch of U.S. 101 
where they live "The Redwood Highway." 
</P>
<P>
On the west side of Laytonville sits Harwood Park -- built with money donated 
by the logging family -- with its dance hall, baseball diamond and rodeo arena. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, Bill and Judith Bailey, wealthy logging equipment wholesalers, 
donate half-a-dozen $1,000 scholarships to area children. The Baileys are the 
family who first pressed the school board on the use of "The Lorax." 
</P>
<P>
"They think that just because they bought the town, they can tell people how to 
think," said Kathi Cloninger, a member of the environmentalist group Earth 
First! A petition that was circulated to keep the book on the reading list drew 
at least 100 names, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Laytonville is unincorporated -- with no mayor, City Council or police 
force -- political hagglings are often played out on its school board and 
within the pages of its weekly newspaper, The Mendocino County Observer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drives New Jaguar 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who drives a shiny new Jaguar in a town dominated by pickup trucks and 
junkyard clunkers, has written letters to the editor, blasting newcomers for 
criticizing the town "even while their radiators are still overheating." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Ackermann, the newspaper's columnist retorted that, "The whole thing is a 
stab of desperation by the loggers, because they're in a dying business, simple 
as that." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the town's logging interests have taken on the school board, 
criticizing it for hiring too many inexperienced first-year teachers who come 
and go within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Art Harwood, the 36-year-old general manager of his family lumber business, 
used that theme to get elected to the five-member school board this year, 
becoming the second member with logging interests to sit on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
And then came "The Lorax" issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Baileys became upset after they discovered the journal kept by their 
8-year-old son, Sammy, about his reactions to the Seuss book, Bill Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
"He came home one day and asked my wife, 'Papa doesn't love trees anymore, does 
he?' " said Bailey, who spent 14 years as a logger before opening his wholesale 
equipment business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petition Filed 
</P>
<P>
After hearing reports from friends of their own children's similar line of 
questioning, Judith Bailey filed a petition with the school district to have 
the book removed as required reading. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever suggested that the book be banned," said Bailey, a college English 
major who says he has read and enjoyed the book. "But now they're calling my 
wife a book banner and a book burner. It's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
Theodor (Ted) Geisel, who as Dr. Seuss has written more than 40 children's 
books including "The Cat in the Hat" and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," is 
baffled by his book's role in Laytonville's environmental controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"This book isn't against logging at all," the 85-year-old author said. "In 
fact, the book wasn't even concerned with the wood in the trees, it was the 
leaves at the top of the trees, that's all the Once-ler harvested. 
</P>
<P>
"Wood was used as a symbol for many things. I don't want to throw logs on their 
fire, but the book is taken up by schools and libraries all across the country 
as a symbol of conservation." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Buckley, superintendent of the Laytonville Unified School District, said 
the book was chosen to help satisfy the history, social science and literature 
requirements for second graders. 
</P>
<P>
Several students said they won't stop reading Dr. Seuss books. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Seuss is strange, that's why you like him," said 15-year-old Jonah 
Renfort. "People grow up on him. For a little town like this, Dr. Seuss is 
about the strangest you can get."

E. GERMANY RIDING OUT REFUGEE CRISIS, SHUNS REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's Communist regime seems determined to ride out the crisis 
provoked by thousands of its citizens seeking refuge in the West and has shown 
no sign of initiating reforms that might help keep its citizens from trying to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
And, diplomatic analysts say, this policy may lead to even greater problems in 
the future for the country's aging leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"The choice is an almost impossible one for the government," a senior diplomat 
here said. "If they don't liberalize the economy and restrictions on personal 
life, the people will get more and more frustrated. But if they do, they are 
admitting that their hard-line Marxist policies have been wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma of the East German rulers was posed another way by Karl Kaiser, 
director of Bonn's Foreign Policy Institute: "Either they keep the lid on and 
sooner or later they get an explosion. Or they try to liberalize and, to a 
degree, risk popular movements arising, as happened in Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no easy way out, but the second course at least would give the 
government a chance by instituting limited reforms." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the only reaction of the East German regime has been to launch 
a vitriolic barrage against Hungary for letting the refugees cross its frontier 
into Austria without travel documents and against West Germany for encouraging 
the emigration. 
</P>
<P>
"The language the Communist press is using is remarkable," an observer here 
said. "It is almost like Nazi propaganda streaming against West Germany. The 
East German regime is even accusing Bonn of reviving Nazism." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for a lack of a coherent response to the flight of the East 
Germans -- more than 15,000 have done so illegally so far this year and another 
90,000 will legally emigrate to West Germany -- is the silence of Communist 
Party chief Erich Honecker, who is 77. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker has been recovering from a reported gallstone operation and has not 
appeared in public nor publicly responded to the refugee crisis. None of the 
other members of the ruling Politburo have publicly dealt with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The regime has been shaken up by so many people leaving," said a Western 
diplomat. "It is a rejection of the state created by these old leaders -- of 
which they are very proud -- so the question is whether Honecker has even been 
informed of the extent of the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Free Elections 
</P>
<P>
And the last kind of reform that the East German government is expected to 
introduce would be any kind of free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"This government knows what happened when free elections were introduced in 
Poland," commented a political specialist. "They know they would be at least as 
unpopular with their people as the Polish Communists were in that country." 
</P>
<P>
The East German regime is also losing the limited support it enjoyed from West 
Germany's Social Democratic Party, which had held the position that Bonn should 
be supportive of the East German leadership in the interest of inner-German 
harmony and stability. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out," says Social Democratic Party senior member Egon Bahr, 
who helped create former Chancellor Willy Brandt's sympathetic Ostpolitik in 
the early 1970s. "Stability can be reached only through the ability to make 
reforms. A regime that does not adapt can become encrusted. And when the crusts 
break off, that can be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Duisberg, a Bonn official who deals with East German affairs, says: "With 
or without Honecker, East Germany has to fear that if it brings in reforms in 
the direction of democracy and a market economy, the entire basis for its 
existence will be removed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
System Implosion 
</P>
<P>
"But if it does nothing, there will also be destabilization. People's readiness 
to make an effort for the state will fail, and over a long period, there will 
be implosion of the system." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the East German government maintained its rock-hard position because 
its economy was the most prosperous in the Communist East Bloc and, according 
to experts here, because East Germans are extremely attached to their heimat -- 
their home areas. But things are changing. 
</P>
<P>
As one commentator put it: "In East Germany the state is as solid as stone. It 
is the population that is dissolving." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the East German regime tended to deport political dissidents to 
West Germany to get rid of potential troublemakers. But now, with 100,000 or 
more young Germans leaving annually, the state is becoming denuded of the 
workers it needs most. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Keep the Young? 
</P>
<P>
So the problem of the government, in the view of analysts here, is how to keep 
the socialist state intact but at the same time keep large numbers of young 
people it cannot afford to lose from going to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The government might get tough by tightening up on visa vacations to Hungary," 
a senior diplomat said. "But this would just make the people more unhappy.

Three bombs exploded Sunday in the city of Cali, killing a security guard, and 
a newspaper that has crusaded against Colombia's cocaine barons said that one 
of its reporters was slain by thugs. 
</P>
<P>
The bombings in Cali, headquarters of one of Colombia's big cocaine cartels, 
occurred shortly after midnight at two banks and a shopping center, said Col. 
Rozo Julio Navarro, chief of the national police force in the city, 180 miles 
southwest of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro told Colombian radio that the bomb at the shopping center killed a 
guard. He said another bomb was found at a bank and defused. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police in Buenaventura, northwest of Cali on the Pacific coast, said 
journalist Guillermo Gomez Murillo was shot to death Saturday night while 
watching television in his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Editor Slain in 1986 
</P>
<P>
Gomez Murillo was a correspondent for the Bogota newspaper El Espectador, whose 
editor was slain by drug traffickers in 1986. The paper's offices were heavily 
damaged Sept. 2 in a car bomb attack. 
</P>
<P>
El Espectador said Sunday that Gomez Murillo was known "for having revealed 
anomalies in the administration of this part of the country." 
</P>
<P>
In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A rocket or mortar was fired at the U.S. Embassy in central Bogota on 
Sunday night, but it failed to explode, the embassy's Marine guard said. He 
said the projectile knocked some concrete out of the wall but caused no further 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The current leading presidential candidate of the ruling Liberal Party, 
Alberto Santofimio Botero, ortedly called for an end to extraditions during a 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not support giving up Colombians to be tried under someone else's roof," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under emergency measures imposed Aug. 18, President Virgilio Barco Vargas has 
resumed extraditions to the United States of suspected drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
So far, one person has been extradited to the United States, and extradition 
proceedings are under way against two others.

The statement by Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State Council, China's Cabinet, is 
the government's strongest indication yet that Zhao is unlikely to face a 
criminal trial. Zhao, who has not been seen in public since May 19, was removed 
from his post as party head in June for allegedly "splitting the party" and 
supporting what the government now calls a "counterrevolutionary rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
"Yuan Mu revealed that Zhao Ziyang remains free and enjoys the same pay and 
welfare as before," the New China News Agency reported. "Zhao Ziyang still 
lives in Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
Yuan added, however, that the Communist Party is still investigating Zhao and 
that he will be treated according to "the facts of his mistakes." Zhao, 70, who 
was replaced as general secretary by former Shanghai party chief Jiang Zemin, 
is still a Communist Party member, and he could be further punished by being 
stripped of his party membership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells Japanese Reporters 
</P>
<P>
Yuan's remarks were made to visiting Japanese journalists, then distributed by 
the official Chinese news agency. He was not quoted as specifically dealing 
with the issue of whether Zhao might be tried. 
</P>
<P>
But by officially indicating that there has been no decision to detain Zhao, 
even under house arrest, Yuan's statement appeared to back up more informal 
comments made to Western reporters last week by Vice Minister of Culture Ying 
Ruocheng. Ying, when asked specifically whether Zhao would be placed on trial, 
replied: "I don't think so. I don't think so. That's a personal opinion. (Not) 
unless he did something I didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
Some hard-liners would prefer to take more severe action against Zhao, who was 
widely viewed as China's most powerful advocate of rapid economic and political 
reform, in order to increase the difficulties he would face in any bid to 
return to power after paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, 85, leaves the political 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
In an important indication that some economic reforms will continue despite 
Zhao's fall, Yuan also announced the most sweeping price adjustments to be 
approved since an economic retrenchment program was launched a year ago. China 
will raise the prices of grain, cotton and some other farm produce, energy and 
some key raw materials in order to promote the development of these segments of 
its economy, Yuan said. 
</P>
<P>
While the price boosts will occur under conditions of government control, they 
will bring the costs of these key items closer to true market prices and thus 
help eliminate some of the severe irrationality in pricing that distorts 
China's economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transport Prices Hiked 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, transportation prices were raised sharply, with the average 
cost of long-distance train tickets jumping 120%. Large price jumps in the 
areas announced Sunday would be major steps toward price reform. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions for carrying out price reform, which was put on hold last summer 
amid accelerating inflation, may have been improved by a government-initiated 
economic slowdown that has begun to show signs of sharply reducing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Official statistics released Sunday indicated that during the month of August, 
there was virtually no inflation in 35 large and medium-size cities across 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Prices last December, according to official statistics, were up 26% over 
December, 1987. Figures released Sunday show that urban prices in August were 
up only 13% over August, 1987. The far greater part of that 13% rise -- perhaps 
all of it -- occurred during late 1988 and the first months of this year, when 
prices were climbing sharply. That means prices have been essentially stable 
over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that China's current restructuring program aims to strengthen 
agriculture and basic industries and infrastructure, while limiting "excessive 
development" of most light industries. The speed of expansion of small rural 
and private enterprises, which have been the most dynamic sector of China's 
industrial economy, will be slowed, while their technological and management 
levels will be upgraded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Touching on other political questions, Yuan said that martial law in Beijing 
cannot be lifted soon because it is "one of the important factors to maintain 
the stability of the capital and the whole country," the official news agency 
reported, paraphrasing his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan also said that China will insist on maintaining the dictatorship of the 
Communist Party and that no independent trade unions, opposition parties or 
opposition factions will be allowed to exist.

DEPUTIES SHOOT SUSPECTED DRUG DEALER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected drug dealer was shot and critically injured by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies in Inglewood, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified man's car was stopped by deputies in the 3300 block of 80th 
Street on Saturday evening after he was seen conducting a drug transaction, a 
sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The man refused to get out of the car and then was seen bending over the seat, 
Deputy Chris Wahla said. Fearing the man was reaching for a gun, one deputy 
fired a shotgun blast into the car, Wahla said. The man was hit by several 
pellets and taken to UCLA Medical Center in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
No weapon was recovered from the car, although deputies discovered several 
ounces of cocaine, Wahla said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was under investigation by the department's homicide bureau.

CAR STOPPED ON FREEWAY IS HIT, MAN DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The driver of a car that was stopped on the San Diego Freeway was killed when 
another car slammed into it from behind early Sunday, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who the CHP described as a man in his 40s, stopped his car in the 
far right lane north of the Redondo Beach Boulevard exit for an unknown reason 
and was sitting in his car with the lights off, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
A Toyota MR2 traveling at approximately 55 m.p.h. plowed into the stopped 
vehicle, Officer Jim Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
The first car exploded upon impact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
When fire crews arrived the vehicle was fully engulfed in flames, Los Angeles 
County Fire Department Capt. Craig Leinin said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no need to summon medical help for the victim," Leinin said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's name was being withheld until his family is notified. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the MR2, Roni Hemsley, 21, Glendora, and her passengers, Rosa 
Perdomo, 30, Los Angeles, and Glen Saputra, 30, Torrance, were taken to Robert 
F. Kennedy Medical Center, where they were treated for cuts and bruises and 
released, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP was still trying to determine late Sunday why the victim stopped his 
car on the freeway.

REISSUE A LICENSE TO KILL; 
</P>
<P>
IN THIS WAR, LIVES OF NARCO-TERRORISTS MUST BE AT STAKE, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) recently chaired a 
hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on the subject of the 
terrorist threat. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Colombian drug lords begin attacking Americans now that we've declared war 
on them and begun to extradite their partners in crime? 
</P>
<P>
The chilling answer from terrorism experts is "yes, if they want to." Oliver B. 
Revell of the FBI testified before a Senate hearing last week that "if the 
cartels want to have blood running in the streets of America . . . I can't give 
you assurances we would be in a position to preempt it." 
</P>
<P>
The question then becomes, how do we respond? 
</P>
<P>
One thing we can do is reconsider the wisdom of Executive Order 12333, signed 
in 1975, which absolutely bars agencies of the U.S. government from ordering 
the killing of specific foreign individuals. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, no matter how many acts of terrorism are ordered by leaders of 
the Medellin drug cartel or any other terrorists around the world, they can 
rest secure in the knowledge that their lives are safe from American reprisals 
or preemptive strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of narco-terrorism is quite unlike any we've confronted because of 
the unprecedented combination of greed, evil and money. It is a volatile 
mixture that has yielded deadly results. Look at the toll in Colombia: 70 
judges killed in this decade, along with dozens of journalists, hundreds of 
police and a leading candidate for that country's presidency. And look at the 
toll in America: thousands of lives -- often the youngest and most vulnerable 
among us -- ended or permanently damaged by the drugs these cartels ship to our 
shores. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike terrorists based in the Middle East or Europe, narco-terrorists have a 
criminal infrastructure in place in America -- hundreds of drug traffickers in 
virtually every city and region of the country -- ready to respond to their 
commands. In 1987, the murder of Drug Enforcement Administration informant 
Barry Seal in Louisiana was believed to be on the orders of the cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Narco-terrorists have the will and the means to attack not just innocent 
civilians, but the very institutions that form the foundation of our society. 
In that sense, they are more than lawbreakers. They are a threat to our 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot officially declare war against a group that has no diplomatic status 
as a country. But we should respond to their behavior as if we were at war. 
Placed in the context of such a conflict, Executive Order 12333 is an 
unnecessary and unwise restriction on the President's power to defend against a 
terrorist threat. 
</P>
<P>
When confronted by such a threat, the President should have the widest array of 
options available to him. It does not make sense to wage war against terrorists 
with one hand tied behind our back. Nor does it make sense to telegraph to our 
enemies what tactics we have already ruled out by law. 
</P>
<P>
Some will say that such a change in our policy would be immoral. I disagree. Is 
it more moral to let a terrorist carry out an attack that kills innocent 
civilians when the only thing preventing us from stopping him is an executive 
order? Is it more moral for us to launch a bombing raid on an area in which 
terrorists live, thereby threaten ing the lives of innocent civilians, because 
a covert mission targeted to those same terrorists cannot be authorized under 
our laws? 
</P>
<P>
The occasions on which a President would find cause to order a strike against a 
terrorist would be limited. We should continue to attempt to prevent terrorist 
acts and bring terrorists to justice through normal channels, if possible. But 
Executive Order 12333 should be revised to account for those cases in which 
force is the only means we have to prevent a tragic attack against us. To 
safeguard against abuse, such action should be taken only with the approval of 
the President and the leadership of Congress and the intelligence committees, 
as is done now for other covert operations. 
</P>
<P>
Changing Executive Order 12333 should not be seen as a panacea, but making 
terrorists susceptible to direct attack would signal the seriousness with which 
we view their acts and hopefully make them more hesitant to act against us. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, Executive Order 12333 represents a safe haven for 
narco-terrorists. While we deepen our involvement in the war against the drug 
lords, we must recognize that the price of that war will be exacted in blood as 
well as dollars. Should not their lives, as well as our own, be at stake?

SHOW EASTERN EUROPEANS WHICH SIDE WE ARE ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY F. TREVERTON, Gregory F. Treverton is senior fellow and director of 
the Europe-America Project at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American policy toward Eastern Europe seems either so befuddled by the pace of 
events that it cannot react or so pessimistic about prospects that it feels 
little need to do anything. Confusion is understandable and pessimism is 
warranted, but neither is the right guide to policy. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the pace of events is dizzying. Yesterday's impossibility becomes 
today's conventional wisdom and tomorrow's old hat. Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev himself has pushed the pace: By publicizing his telephone call to 
Polish Communists to tell them the time had come for a non-communist 
government, he toppled dominoes that will fall at least in Hungary; opposition 
leaders there who had been prepared to settle for half a loaf now say, "Why 
settle for less than Solidarity?" 
</P>
<P>
The most credible argument for American inaction is that with so much 
uncertainty, anything the United States did would be as likely to boomerang as 
to help. In particular, any action might cross the line for Moscow and look 
like meddling. Thus, the argument runs, better to do nothing than to risk 
giving Moscow or its local allies the pretext for a crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The concern is fair, but we do not seem close to the line. Gorbachev may be 
confused but does not appear worried. His government seems almost to welcome 
Western economic assistance to Eastern Europe; it hardly has much choice. So, 
too, it cannot object to technical assistance to develop managers or economic 
policy-makers. Helping train journalists or opposition party organizers 
probably skates closer to whatever line there is, but however attractive 
America remains in Eastern Europe, journalists and parties have their own good 
reasons to avoid the "made in the USA" label. 
</P>
<P>
It is reasonable to believe that, however confused Moscow may be, defections 
from the Warsaw Pact would still ring alarm bells. Plainly, the United States 
should make sure that it cannot be accused of angling for those defections. 
When the question of military alliances arises -- and it will, pushed, for 
instance, by the younger hotheads in Solidarity whom Lech Walesa strives to 
control -- Washington can say that it is a matter for the Warsaw Pact itself. 
What we care about are the political openings and economic restructuring; we 
are negotiating elsewhere to draw down the military confrontation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The other explanation for Washington's inaction is pessimism: Gorbachev's 
experiment is destined to be still-born and Eastern Europe's economic plight is 
all but hopeless. Both may be true. But for Washington to make policy as though 
it is only waiting for Gorbachev's successors is more than a little strange -- 
to America's allies and to its citizens, not to mention the Eastern Europeans 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
More immediately, doing more for Poland meets with the analogy to the 
mid-1970s. Then, Washington encouraged lending to what looked like a reformist 
Communist government, only to have the lenders find that the reforms were 
elusive and the money only disappeared down a rat hole of consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
The analogy is mistaken, however, and having made a mistake then does not 
justify making another now. This Polish government is led by non-communists, 
not Communists, even if Communist apparatchiks still weigh it down. This 
government's reforms may not succeed, but the attempt will be serious. 
</P>
<P>
And while much of what has happened in Eastern Europe is reversible, this much 
is not: If the Tadeusz Mazowiecki government in Poland fails, it will not -- 
short of the arrival of Soviet tanks -- be replaced by Poland's old Communist 
masters. If it is thrown out, another non-communist government will follow. 
Poland's Communists are -- again save for the arrival of tanks -- gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, helping Poland is now more political than economic. It is help to the 
process of non-communist governance, not a bet on a particular government. 
Whether CIA analysts conclude this government's anti-inflation plan workable is 
relevant but not decisive. Poland has become the first non-communist government 
in Eastern Europe since World War II, and the United States has offered it $119 
million in assistance, plus another $50 million in food aid. Surely, democracy 
in Poland is worth more than one-fourth of a B-2 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
American aid is not in any case going to make Poland's economic future. But the 
political case for doing more is compelling. It should not be beyond our wits 
-- or even our budgets -- to come up with a billion-dollar package and so to 
push our European allies, who are coordinating aid to Poland through the Common 
Market, to do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years of American hopes for Eastern Europe are coming true. It is time to 
bet our hopes, not our fears, and to demonstrate to those who have succeeded in 
Eastern Europe that we are on their side.

REFORM, YES, BUT CAN HE DO MIRACLES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE KIRKPATRICK, Jeane Kirkpatrick writes a syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debate about Mikhail Gorbachev's motives and intentions has been narrowed 
by the changes that have already occurred this year in the Soviet Union, Poland 
and Hungary. So far the changes are in policy rather than in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The pace and scope of change have surprised almost everyone. No one expected 
that contested elections would be held in which Communist candidates would be 
overwhelmingly defeated. But it happened. No one expected that the Soviet 
government would acknowledge the Secret Protocol of the Nazi-Soviet pact, which 
now delegitimizes the Soviet incorporation of the Baltic states. No one 
expected that the Soviet government would acknowledge the Soviet role in the 
massacre of Polish officers in the Katyn Forest. No one believed that strikes 
in a basic industry would be tolerated or permitted to spread. But it all 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
And it is now obvious that Mikhail S. Gorbachev not only wants to rule the 
Soviet Union and to enhance its international power -- but also he seriously 
seeks broad reform of his own society. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is, manifestly, a man with a vision of a different kind of socialism 
-- more successful, less coercive, more participatory. He calls it "Socialist 
pluralism." If he succeeds, we will speak henceforth of 
Marxism-Leninism-Gorbachevism. What his success or failure will mean to the 
United States and the rest of the West is still an open question. 
</P>
<P>
Success, of course, is not assured. The experience of the past year has 
illustrated how difficult it is to change a great bureaucratic society in which 
everyone works for the government. Each aspect of the system reinforces the 
rest. Centralized political power reinforces the centralization of economic 
power and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
So entrenched is state ownership that it is extremely complicated to privatize 
anything. The stagnation of the economy prevents the production of goods that 
could serve as an incentive to increased production. For 70 years, private 
initiative and private enterprise have been discouraged at best or punished 
severely. 
</P>
<P>
Le Monde correspondent Bernard Guetta has said the prerequisite for progress in 
the Soviet Union is for its citizens to believe in the possibility and 
durability of change. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they are beginning to. The Soviet people have been quick to seize the 
opportunities for greater expression offered them in the past two years. 
Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians did not hesitate to vote for Baltic 
nationalists in local elections. They have not hesitated to oppose government 
policies and advocate independence. Elsewhere, Soviet citizens have voted 
overwhelmingly against Communist Party leaders and officeholders -- showing 
little reticence about their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed the Baltic independence movement and the unpopularity of Communist Party 
candidates have become major problems for Gorbachev. So strong are both that in 
dealing with domestic affairs, Gorbachev is caught in a double bind: He 
believes more freedom is necessary for a more successful communist society -- 
but when he grants more freedom, the people reject communism and Soviet rule 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
How can socialism be reformed, yet remain Socialist? How can Gorbachev limit 
the Communist Party's monopoly of power, yet maintain it in power? How can he 
weaken the party, yet consolidate his own power? How can he grant free speech 
and prevent the conquered peoples of the Soviet Union from demanding 
independence? 
</P>
<P>
As if that were not bad enough, Gorbachev confronts a similar double bind in 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
His success is in large measure a consequence of persuading Europeans, Chinese, 
Americans and assorted others that "there is no Soviet threat." 
</P>
<P>
He has sworn that the use of force by the Soviet Union against a fellow 
socialist state, or by any European state against another, is "unthinkable." He 
has strongly implied that every Warsaw Pact country is free to choose its own 
allies and map its own future. Already the people of Hungary, Poland and East 
Germany have made clear that given a choice they prefer a non-communist future. 
</P>
<P>
If Gorbachev accepts the progressive independence they seek, the Warsaw Pact 
dissolves. If he holds them by force, he revives the Soviet threat -- in 
technicolor. 
</P>
<P>
His situation is extremely difficult. His problems are probably insoluble. 
Socialism is not a successful economic system, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
And it is probably impossible today to hold on to an empire except by force. 
</P>
<P>
Will Mikhail Gorbachev be in power a year from now? Personally, I hope so. But 
don't bet on it.

In the cold, damp air Sunday evening, the Padres walked away from Candlestick 
Park with ambivalent feelings about the pennant race, the San Francisco Giants 
and especially themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They knew they had made an impression on these Giants, winning two of three 
games in this series, including a split Sunday of their doubleheader, losing 
the first game, 5-3, and winning the second, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
They know that they are a superior team to the one that staggered along for the 
first four months of this season before going on a 21-6 spurt since Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
They also know that they're still in trouble, deep trouble. Just 12 games 
remain, and they still are five games behind the Giants, tied with the Houston 
Astros for second place. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for the first time," right fielder Tony Gwynn said, "it hit us. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't control our fate anymore. Before, we knew if we had won every game, 
our fate would have been in our own hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say that anymore. As soon as we lost that first game (of the 
doubleheader), we needed help. And that hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this never should have happened. We should have learned our lesson 
last year. We never should have been in this mess in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's happened again." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres wanted so badly to come into Candlestick for a three-game sweep. 
They so badly wanted to shut up their critics. They so badly wanted to prove to 
everyone in this town that they were wrong about them. 
</P>
<P>
They were enraged when they read a column in a San Francisco paper that read, 
in part: "The San Diego Padres are a joke. After a miserable start last season, 
the Padres surged late in the season, causing many people to pick them this 
season. Again, they got off slowly, again they put on a big push late in the 
season. But as soon as they realize they're in the race, they'll collapse." 
</P>
<P>
They cut out the column and put it on the clubhouse wall and reacted angrily 
when told that a few Giants were saying, "the only way we can lose this thing 
is if we catch the plague." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell them the plague is in town," Padre bullpen stopper Mark Davis said, "and 
we are it." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres wanted so badly to leap within three games of the Giants, putting so 
much pressure on the Giants that they would gag down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we wanted to win that first game so badly today," Gwynn said, 
"because there would have been all kinds of pressure on them. And when you have 
pressure, you start making mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Padres blew their opportunity by losing the first game and 
allowing the Giants to be quite satisfied with their split and five-game 
cushion. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very good that we're five games up instead of three," Giant Manager 
Roger Craig said. "I think now, it'll be tough for them. Anything can happen, 
but the schedule's in our favor. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just running out of time." 
</P>
<P>
Giant outfielder Pat Sheridan, who drove in the winning run and made a 
game-saving catch in Game 1, said: "The way we feel now, it's like we're 
destined to win this thing. We're more confident than we've been all season. 
</P>
<P>
"The one game, more than any other, that made us feel that way was the 
Cincinnati game a couple of weeks ago (Sept. 4). It was the first game of a 
seven-game road trip. We were down 8-0, and we knew that the Padres had won. 
When we came back and won that one, we knew it was meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt like the '84 Tigers all over again, you know, when everything goes 
your way. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we feel now, there's no way we can lose this thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres easily won the second game when Bruce Hurst pitched a five-hit 
complete game; he has now allowed just seven hits in his past 18 innings. But 
it was after the opener that the Padres were kicking themselves for wasting 
first baseman Jack Clark's dazzling power display. 
</P>
<P>
Clark went four for four, hitting a home run, two doubles and a single. But 
unfortunately for the Padres, after Clark's homer in the first, the bases were 
empty every time he came to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
He did everything in his power to single-handedly beat the Giants -- and later 
hit a bases-empty homer in the second game -- but when starter Calvin Schiraldi 
left the opener after two innings with a strained right forearm, the Giants 
teed off on the Padre bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Grant came out with a 2-0 lead in the third inning but quickly gave up 
three runs in three innings, including a home run by Kevin Mitchell. The Padres 
tied the game in the sixth on Benito Santiago's sacrifice fly in the sixth, 
which could have been at least a double if not for Sheridan's diving catch 
against the fence. But the Giants took the lead again in the bottom of the 
sixth, 4-3, on Sheridan's run-scoring single off reliever Greg Harris. 
</P>
<P>
And any hopes the Padres entertained of winning were dashed by Mitchell, who 
hit a solo homer in the seventh off reliever Pat Clements. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, yes, Mitchell. The man who was born in San Diego, raised in San Diego and 
played baseball in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Well, he plays for the Giants now, and without him and his 45 homers and 120 
RBIs, the Padres and Astros would be battling for first instead of second. 
</P>
<P>
Just how tense was Mitchell before this critical doubleheader? 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: He was sleeping in the trainer's room during the 1 hour 
25-minute rain delay before the first pitch, skipping indoor batting practice 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I was just tired," Mitchell said, shrugging sheepishly. "I just went in 
there, took my cuts, and hit them out. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we can just take care of our business and not worry about anyone else. 
It's like we didn't even lose today. They came in here talking sweep, and they 
couldn't do it. There's no way we're going to let anyone sweep us." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, not a single team has swept the Giants in any series, home or road, 
this season. They've played consistently well since June, which is why they're 
going into the final two weeks with a comfortable lead. 
</P>
<P>
"You could parallel us to the Blue Jays," McKeon said, "that's how good we've 
been playing. The only difference is that we're chasing a team that's been 
consistent for 4 1/2 months instead of the Orioles, who you knew would 
eventually fade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating, but what are you going to do. We just have to look for help, 
and hopefully, it'll come." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts, Padre third baseman-outfielder, was given clearance by Dr. Cliff 
Colwell of the Padre medical staff to join the team today in Cincinnati. 
Roberts, just as suspected by the Padre doctors, had gastroenteritis. But 
Roberts is also diagnosed as having a muscle tear in his left rib cage. The 
reason for the scare, which led to Roberts' hospitalization Friday night, was 
that he had a sudden shortness of breath while sitting in the dugout in the 
fifth inning. "That (gastroenteritis), coupled with the muscle tear in his rib 
cage," Padre General Manager Tony Siegle said, "made the two of them into 
something that scared him very much, and Bip hyperventilated." Roberts spent 
Friday night in San Francisco General Hospital, was released Saturday and 
underwent further testing Sunday at Scripps Clinic, which revealed a bacterium. 
"He just got very, very frightened," Siegle said. "Thank God he's OK." . . . 
Calvin Schiraldi said he hurt his arm in the second inning when throwing a 
forkball on the second pitch to Pat Sheridan. He had his arm massaged in 
between innings, but when he warmed up before the third, he was unable to 
continue. "I knew something was wrong right away," Schiraldi said, "but I 
thought it was a cramp or something. It didn't feel too bad when I was throwing 
my fastball, but I couldn't throw through with my slider. I thought it was best 
I came out. We had too much to gain for me to mess it up for us." . . . The 
under card featured the batting race between Tony Gwynn and Will Clark. Gwynn 
went two for nine in the doubleheader while Clark went two for seven. They part 
company with Gwynn owning the lead, .339 to .338.

2 KILLED, 6 WOUNDED AS GANG FIRES ON FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
30-YEAR TURF WAR BLAMED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING TERMED ONE OF WORST IN ORANGE 
COUNTY HISTORY 
</P>

<P>
A group of Orange County gang members, riding in a pickup truck and armed with 
automatic assault rifles, opened fire on a Garden Grove family leaving in 
several cars for the movies, killing a 17-year-old rival and a 4-year-old boy 
while wounding six others, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers, who had ventured onto turf controlled by a gang of bitter 
enemies, systematically shot at a dozen people at dusk Saturday outside a home 
in one of the bloodiest gang attacks in Orange County history, police said. The 
victims were preparing to see the movie "Lethal Weapon II." 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Miguel Lorenzo Navarro, 17, a warehouse clerk, and Frank Fernandez 
Jr., 4, whose 23-year-old mother, Irene, 2-year-old brother, Christopher, and 
18-year-old aunt, Inez Fernandez, were among those wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Fernandez and her surviving son were in satisfactory condition Sunday 
night -- the mother at Garden Grove Medical Center and her son at Fountain 
Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Also wounded in the Garden Grove attack were family friends Richard Rendon and 
Anthony Carmona, both 26, and Jennie Hernandez, 21, all of Santa Ana. Inez 
Fernandez, Carmona and Hernandez were treated for minor injuries and released. 
Rendon was in critical condition with leg wounds at the Fountain Valley 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police detectives and gang specialists from Santa Ana and Garden Grove were 
working together in the investigation. They believe members of a Santa 
Ana-based gang, known as 5th Street, carried out the attack, but they had no 
suspects in custody Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Such drive-by shootings are relatively rare in Orange County, where gangs are 
growing but thus far have not resorted to the kind of violence associated with 
the large gangs of South-Central Los Angeles, where children increasingly have 
become victims of shootings. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night along the 13800 block of La Bonita Avenue, less than a block 
from Santa Ana city limits in a working class neighborhood of second- and 
third-generation Mexican-Americans, a 30-year-old feud between two gangs was 
played out against a backdrop of what police say has been increasing activity 
and unrest among Santa Ana-area gangs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Never Forget' 
</P>
<P>
Residents have spotted gang members cruising the street in recent months but 
said there had been nothing to foreshadow the violent outburst Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be surprised if anyone sleeps on this street for a long time," said Ruth 
Macias, a La Bonita resident since the 1940s who lives three doors from where 
the shooting began. "You never forget the popping of the guns. Never." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Navarro was the primary target because he was a member of the 17th 
Street gang, which was blamed by the rival 5th Street gang for a recent 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The dark-colored pickup truck turned onto the 13800 block of La Bonita Avenue, 
across from a Pentecostal church, as members of the Fernandez family, several 
relatives and friends talked and laughed in front of a tiny stucco house. The 
late-model pickup rolled slowly by with the windows down and the occupants' 
guns blazing, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of gunfire were quickly replaced by screams and cries for help as 
the street and sidewalk were littered with bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 20 rounds were fired by the attackers who obviously had no 
concern about who their gunfire would harm," Garden Grove Police Sgt. Dan Lyons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors who had gathered outside to chat or share a beer on the muggy night 
scattered as the bullets riddled several homes and cars along a 50-yard stretch 
of La Bonita Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
One man was under his car, working on his transmission, when the gunfire 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"I just clutched my wrench and started praying," said Rodolfo Zepeda. "I just 
hugged the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Navarro, known as Smokey to his gang brothers, was sitting in the back seat of 
a black Nissan sedan parked on the street, police and witnesses said. When the 
shooting started, he lunged for the front seat, throwing his body over a 
terrified Inez Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never Had a Chance' 
</P>
<P>
"If he hadn't shielded me, I would have been dead," said Fernandez, who was 
slightly injured when her neck was grazed by an errant bullet. "The truck was 
less than 20 feet away. Mike never had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's 4-year-old nephew, Frank Jr., was shot several times as he stood in 
the back of another car parked in the family's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Sr. had just taken his family to his mother's La Bonita Avenue house 
after an outing at a nearby park. They had gone there to meet the others, who 
were grabbing coats and sweaters for the regular Saturday night outing at a 
drive-in. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's wife was driving, and had left the engine running in the gray 
sedan, believing they would be stopped no more than a minute or two. Irene 
Fernandez, in an interview from the hospital, said she was about to back the 
car out, her three children in the back seat, when the bullets started flying. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like something big and fast," said Frank Fernandez, who described 
himself as a former gang member. "Everybody (outside the car) was yelling, 'Get 
down! Get down!' I tried to put everybody down, but my little boy was standing 
up in the back and he got shot through the chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was crying," he recalled. "My sister opened the back door and said, 
'Frankie's shot. . . .' I took my son in the car and drove to the hospital. I 
wasn't gonna wait for no ambulance. My first priority was my son." 
</P>
<P>
The assault, police said, was carried out by members of the 5th Street gang, 
decades-old rival of the 17th Street gang, in retaliation for a shooting 
several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Youths who identified themselves as members of the 17th Street gang denied any 
involvement in the earlier incident, and said Saturday night's shooting was 
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Are Rules' 
</P>
<P>
Chris Lovato, a 17th Street gang member, said he was on the phone talking with 
a friend at the Fernandez house when he heard someone yell through the 
receiver, "I've been hit! I've been hit!" He ran two blocks to the shooting 
scene to find his best friend, Navarro, bleeding profusely. 
</P>
<P>
"There are rules, and one of them is you don't shoot at women and children," 
Lovato said. 
</P>
<P>
The hows and whys mattered little to Navarro's mother, Micki Camacho, who wept 
softly Sunday while holding a picture of her son, "Mikey." 
</P>
<P>
"I tried and tried to get him to quit the gang," she said. "But he wouldn't 
listen. He said it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
Navarro, his mother recounted, had been a gang member since he was 13. In 1986, 
the handsome, dark-haired teen-ager had been shot in the stomach as he stood 
outside his mother's house in another apparent gang incident. He was not 
seriously wounded, and a week later, she said, he began a 2 1/2-year sentence 
in a California Youth Authority facility for possession of a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, I felt better he was there than on the streets," Camacho said 
outside her Santa Ana home Sunday. "On the streets, I worried all the time. I 
used to spend night after night searching for him. I told him: 'This only leads 
to one thing, death.' " 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Navarro was freed and returned to live with his mother and 
younger brother and sister. Camacho said Navarro constantly warned his 
5-year-old brother not to get involved with gangs. "It's bad business. No 
good," she overheard him say. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro had even shown signs of mending his ways and "going straight," Camacho 
said. He had just begun a new job as a warehouse clerk and purchased his first 
car. Saturday night, Navarro said he would be home by 8 p.m., the curfew 
imposed by his mother. Camacho had gone to the video store to rent some movies 
that she and her son could watch when he returned. 
</P>
<P>
He was killed about 7:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It just rips families apart," she said as her 6-year-old daughter Esmeralda 
hugged her waist. "When will it stop?" 
</P>

Two North San Diego County men were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter after 
their boat sank during a fishing trip. Steve Turner, 40, of Leucadia, the owner 
of the 18-foot boat, and George Beitner, 33, of Carlsbad, were hauled from the 
water about two hours after they sent a 12:30 p.m. distress call. Coast Guard 
Chief Mark Vavra said the rescue was delayed because the location they radioed 
was in error. Rescue vessels from Oceanside and fishing boats in the area could 
find no trace of the missing men or wreckage and stopped searching after an 
hour. The Coast Guard's chopper finally found them 10 miles off Oceanside -- 
more than 5 miles from the position they had reported. Turner and Beitner were 
flown to Palomar Airport, where they were reported unhurt.

The Public Housing Authority in Butte, Mont., failed to maintain proper 
accounting records and implement budgetary controls on a building improvement 
project, according to an audit report compiled by a regional inspector general 
in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD's report said that 
because of the shortcomings, the department "cannot be sure" money awarded for 
the projects was being spent "in the most efficient and economical way." The 
housing authority operates 356 low-income housing units, and the assistance 
program provides money to improve the units' physical condition and upgrade 
their management. As of March, 1989, $4.8 million had been approved for the 
projects.

SHOWERS MAKE RARE SEPTEMBER APPEARANCE, MAY BE BACK 
</P>

Rare September showers sprinkled Orange County over the weekend, and 
forecasters say Southern California may get even more drizzles today. 
</P>
<P>
A fireworks display in conjunction with a Hollywood Bowl concert Saturday night 
was punctuated by a brilliant celestial display of lightning. 
</P>
<P>
"This weather is a preview of late fall and winter," said Bill Hibbert, a 
meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
"We've already seen discussions of snow down to the 5,000-foot level in the 
northern Sierra, and down to 8,000 feet in southern mountains." 
</P>
<P>
By midday Sunday, Santa Ana had recorded .07 inch of rain. San Juan Capistrano 
recorded .03 inch, while Anaheim had .01. Los Angeles recorded .01 inch of 
rain, San Diego reported .08, Escondido .20, and Beaumont and Big Bear Lake had 
rainfall of .04 inch and .05 inch, respectively. Even Palm Springs -- with a 
high temperature of 101 on Sunday -- had .02 inch of rain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wetter in the North 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California showers were pale in contrast with weekend weather in 
Sacramento, where 1.79 inches of rain fell during violent thunderstorms 
generated during the last gasp of Hurricane Octave. 
</P>
<P>
"The drizzle now is a result of leftover moisture from ex-Hurricane Octave, 
which dissipated over the weekend," Hibbert said. "The storm pushed moisture 
into California at the same time a strong low-pressure system began moving 
through." 
</P>
<P>
The combination of the hurricane, the normal onshore flow of moist air and the 
low pressure "create a very good opportunity for clouds and drizzle to form," 
Hibbert said. "A new low-pressure system entering the state now could pop off 
some showers in mountain and offshore areas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Below-Normal Temperatures 
</P>
<P>
Skies will be partly cloudy today, with a chance of showers or thundershowers, 
especially in the mountains and deserts, the National Weather Service said. 
Skies should begin clearing tonight and Tuesday will be mostly sunny, but with 
continued below-normal temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, with a high of 77 in Santa Ana on Sunday, should remain cool 
today, with afternoon temperatures climbing only into the mid-60s to low 70s, 
said National Weather Service meteorologist Gary Nuemann. Lows tonight will 
range from the lows 50s to low 60s. Mountain areas will see lows between the 
mid-30s and low 40s. 
</P>
<P>
Deserts will be cooler than normal today, with possible thundershowers, the 
weather service said. In the high desert, high temperatures will reach only the 
70s. The mercury in the low desert will reach the low 80s to the low 90s.

The Alice-in-Wonderland effect hit me the minute I walked onto the playground. 
</P>
<P>
It was as though I'd walked through a mirror and once again I was a child 
brimming with the jitters of my first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
I had come to James H. Cox Elementary School in Fountain Valley to write a 
story about 6-year-old Jessica Brunner starting first grade. As the children 
assembled on the blacktop all around me, it seemed to prove the adage: The more 
things change, the more they stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
Unexpectedly, I was drawn back into the swirl of feelings that are so universal 
they have become living cliches: the excitement and fear of that first day at 
school, the openness and enthusiasm of a child's approach to the world, the 
blind trust that so many good things lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Even though my first day of kindergarten was 26 years ago and 3,000 miles away 
on a cool, blustery day in New York, it wasn't so different from that hot 
California morning nearly two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
As Jessica walked silently up the school driveway holding her mother's hand, my 
own school memories of kindergarten and first grade flickered past me, as if 
through a camera lens. 
</P>
<P>
Click: The autumn wind was so strong on my first day of kindergarten that it 
swept me along as I walked to school, pushing me into a trot. Brown, red and 
burnt-orange leaves spiraled down as my mother and I made our way through the 
narrow streets of our Long Island town to join the other children streaming 
into the brick elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
I was so excited to be in a classroom that it seemed my mother had disappeared 
the instant I let go of her hand. I know now that she watched me from the door 
for a little while before she left, reluctant to let her youngest child go. 
</P>
<P>
In Jessica's classroom, her teacher showed the children how to push in their 
chairs before leaving the classroom at recess and how to stack them neatly on 
their desks at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Click: In my kindergarten classroom 26 years ago, Miss Scanapicco, our teacher, 
showed us how to spread our towels on the chilly green linoleum floor for nap 
time. Later, we got to sit at the big table and pry open little cartons of milk 
to drink with our school-issued graham crackers. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica and her class lined up by the door, anxious for playtime after a 
morning of patient concentration. Released onto the grass outside, they burst 
into shouts. 
</P>
<P>
Click: My classmates and I crowded through the coatroom, then filed onto the 
playground. It seemed impossibly big and adventurous, with a jungle gym, 
merry-go-round, slides and other things. On a visit years later, I marveled 
that the crumbling asphalt and battered play equipment had inspired such 
expansive excitement. 
</P>
<P>
When Jessica's teacher asked her bright-eyed pupils what they would like to 
learn this year, their hands shot up into the air with suggestions. They wanted 
to know all about reading, science, animals, insects, math. 
</P>
<P>
Click: In first grade I learned to tell time, practicing by pushing the arms 
around and around on the face of a huge cardboard clock. It seemed that in an 
instant I had learned a long-sought-after secret and gained entree into the 
grown-ups' world. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica and her friends practiced writing their names over and over on the 
black lines of a yellow workbook, and then drew pictures of themselves with 
brightly colored crayons. 
</P>
<P>
Click: I flashed on another first-grade memory. In this snapshot, I was 
practicing writing the letters of the alphabet on off-white paper with tiny 
turquoise flecks. Painstakingly, I squeezed the forms between the solid and 
dotted blue lines. 
</P>
<P>
These pictures sped through my mind and the characters in them began to move, 
just as the figures in separate frames of film come to life when fed through a 
movie projector. 
</P>
<P>
As I sat at the back of Jessica's classroom, watching her recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance with her class, I felt the weight of the distance I had traveled 
since my own first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed eons ago that I was as cheerful and optimistic as Jessica and her 
classmates. Somewhere along the way, I learned to guard myself, to hesitate, to 
calculate. 
</P>
<P>
And as I watched Jessica smiling at her new friends, it seemed that in learning 
those things, I had learned far too much.

POSTSCRIPT: TOO LATE FOR LITTLE VICTIM, STOPLIGHT IS FINALLY INSTALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than two years, residents in the area of El Toro Road and Normandale 
Drive pleaded for a stoplight at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
They said the accident-prone, six-lane crossing was a deathtrap. Tragically, 
the prediction proved accurate. On July 28, a neighborhood child, Andy Dao, 6, 
died in a two-vehicle collision at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Andy's death galvanized the families who live near the intersection. Last month 
they began circulating a petition to the county. They wrote letters. They made 
phone calls. They held a vigil at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Among those participating in the Aug. 8 vigil was Andy's mother, Phuong Dao. As 
tears streamed down her cheeks, she said: "If there had been a light, I believe 
Andy would be alive now. I hope whoever is responsible for lights will pay 
attention to this as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Today, a stoplight is in place. County government had authorized a light for 
the intersection more than a year ago. But delays crept in. Officials at the 
county's Environmental Management Agency (EMA) pointed fingers at a private 
development firm, the Baldwin Co., which had been assigned by the county to get 
the stoplight installed. An official at Baldwin, in turn, pointed fingers at 
county bureaucracy, saying county EMA officials were dragging their feet in 
approving plans for the light. 
</P>
<P>
Both EMA and Baldwin had predicted that it would be November or later before 
the stoplight could finally be installed. Residents groaned when told in August 
about still more delays. They complained that school would soon be starting, so 
more young lives would be endangered as students tried to cross the 
intersection to get to school buses. 
</P>
<P>
Then County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who represents the area, stepped in. 
"It's our wish to get this moving expeditiously," he said tersely on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Wheels then began to turn. To the residents' delight, work crews began 
assembling the stoplight a few days later. By Sept. 6, the stoplight was 
installed and working. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes such a difference," said Marilyn Judge, a neighbor of the Dao family. 
"I was crossing that intersection just the other day, and as I crossed El Toro 
on the green light, able to get across all six lanes safely, I was thinking 
that little Andy would be alive today if that light had been in place then." 
</P>
<P>
Judge said residents are grateful that the stoplight became operative just as 
schools were reopening. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews last week, both a county EMA official and a Baldwin officer 
credited Vasquez with breaking the impasse. "With the help of Supervisor Gaddi 
Vasquez, the work on this was expedited," said Lance Matshuhara, chief of 
signal design in the EMA's traffic engineering division. "The Baldwin Co. had 
been waiting for material to complete the job, and they got it sooner than they 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Fearns, executive vice president of Baldwin, said last week: "We had a 
meeting with Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez. We told him we were having trouble 
getting the type of poles approved by the county. Once the supervisor got 
involved, we got the poles very quickly, because he was putting pressure on the 
county staff to get those poles. . . . I think credit should go to Supervisor 
Vasquez for being the catalyst in bringing about a quick solution." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Vasquez said: "I made it clear that getting this job 
finished was of utmost priority to me. . . . It did require some personal 
intervention." 
</P>
<P>
Other county officials said much of the credit should go to the residents, who 
refused to stop pressing for action. Judge said neighbors could not forget what 
happened to Andy Dao. 
</P>
<P>
"We in this neighborhood still mourn the death of little Andy," Judge said. 
"And now that we have the stoplight, the next thing we hope to do is to install 
a plaque and plant a tree in his memory at the neighborhood park (at Vintage 
Way and Normandale Drive). 
</P>
<P>
"Andy will always be missed in this neighborhood."

DEFENSE MAKES A DIFFERENCE, AS IT USUALLY DOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most obvious difference between the Raiders and Rams this season is that 
the Rams have the personnel to play effective defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, as a 1989 defensive team, are basically inept, proving it rather 
conclusively in Kansas City Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
On a good day for quarterback Jay Schroeder, the Raiders lost, 24-19, to the 
Kansas City Chiefs because they couldn't defend against three long touchdown 
drives measuring 71, 88 and 92 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later in Anaheim, on a big day for quarterback Jim Everett and wide 
receiver Henry Ellard, the Rams won easily, 31-17, by playing a smart defensive 
game against the Indianapolis Colts -- particularly against running back Eric 
Dickerson and his very young quarterback, Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, in a stirring effort to keep the Rams off Dickerson's back, attacked 
with pass formations exclusively -- with new sets featuring three and four wide 
receivers. Their objective was to force the Ram defense to double-cover 
Chandler's receivers -- thus opening some holes for Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams simply ignored this strategy. They lined up against Dickerson, anyway. 
They knew they could beat a young passer by reacting to the ball when he put it 
up. They weren't going to let Dickerson win it. On nearly every down they met 
Dickerson with a gang regardless of whether he had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler is 23 years old. He is the youngest Colt. He was possibly the youngest 
player on the field. He is one of the youngest quarterbacks ever called on to 
lead a National Football League championship contender. 
</P>
<P>
And although he is a fine talent with, no doubt, a fine future -- demonstrating 
it with a touchdown bomb in the second quarter -- he is no threat yet. The 
Indianapolis threat is Dickerson, who gained 100-plus yards against a team that 
committed seven or eight of its 11 defensive players against him on every down. 
</P>
<P>
That is the way to defense Dickerson. That is the way to defense Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
On the Anaheim field, Dickerson, who is 29, appeared to be as fast and 
dangerous as ever. But the Indianapolis defensive team, by comparison with the 
Rams, is neither fast nor dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts seldom got a rush on Everett, who was well served, as usual, by his 
offensive line, which is probably the best in the conference. And in the 
secondary, the Colts lacked the quickness to contend with Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis cornerbacks were frequently in step with Ellard under Everett's 
passes, but they were outmaneuvered almost every time at the moment of the 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't another receiver in the league with Ellard's ability to make a 
defensive back lean one way for the ball just as he goes the other way to grab 
it. 
</P>
<P>
This game was child's play for Everett and Ellard. And what it chiefly showed 
is what all such matchups show: The best teams in the American Conference are 
no match for the best in the National Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts are a nice little AFC team, but in Anaheim Sunday they found 
themselves in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say that the Rams are a team without a weakness. On clutch plays, 
for one thing, they don't run the ball well with Greg Bell. Although a team 
coached by John Robinson will always look good in the annual rushing 
statistics, Bell is no Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
What the Rams need is Dickerson. With Everett, Ellard and Dickerson, they would 
be breezing this fall to the Super Bowl. They may be anyway. Not since the 
Waterfield-Van Brocklin-Hirsch-Fears era 30 years ago have the Rams passed the 
ball this artistically. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are fielding a lively, well-coached offensive club this season, 
unlike their recent past. With Schroeder, running back Marcus Allen and quality 
receivers, they have everything, seemingly, but a quality offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
A team that gives up back-to-back sacks in the fourth quarter when it has a 
chance to win -- as the Raiders did in Kansas City -- needs considerably more 
offensive-line depth than this team has. 
</P>
<P>
Where is 1988 center Bill Lewis, the Raiders' MVP blocker last year? 
</P>
<P>
Why did they pick up a center off the streets instead? 
</P>
<P>
Where is their defense? 
</P>
<P>
The defense, of course, is the real problem. There is almost nothing left of 
the last great Raider defensive club these days but safety Vann McElroy. 
</P>
<P>
Howie Long is no longer a factor. Matt Millen is with the San Francisco 49ers. 
Another talent, Sean Jones, was banished for mouthing off during the 1987 
strike. Some of his old teammates have aged. Some are too young. Others are 
perhaps looking forward to a new life in Oakland or Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the '80s when the Raiders came to Los Angeles, they had a Hall of 
Fame talent, Ted Hendricks, at linebacker. Now they have Jackie Shipp there, 
and, as they have discovered, any team dropping from Hendricks to Shipp is in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the Raiders under Al Davis remain the most successful American 
sports team of the last quarter century. They've done a lot -- and they'll be 
back. The question is when.

IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay Coach Lindy Infante after the Packers rallied from a 21-0 deficit to 
defeat New Orleans: "Quite frankly, I'm astounded. . . . The major thing we 
talked about at half was that the worst thing we could do was panic and say 
there was no way we could catch up against these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota defensive lineman Henry Thomas after Chicago scored 28 points in the 
fourth quarter of a 38-7 victory over the Vikings: "We laid an egg in the 
fourth quarter, it was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll after the Steelers were routed for the second week 
in a row, this time in Cincinnati, 41-10: "Either the Super Bowl team comes out 
of the Central Division, or we are very bad, one or the other. We're not a very 
good football team, but we're not as good right now as we're going to be later 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Steeler quarterback Bubby Brister on the 0-2 start: "You've got to believe. 
That's all we've got. No one can get closer than we've gotten when you go 
through two games like this." 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay safety Mark Robinson after Joe Montana's four-yard touchdown run with 
40 seconds remaining gave the 49ers a 20-16 victory: "You spill your guts. You 
are tired, you are hurting, then something like that happens. That makes the 
whole thing tough." 
</P>
<P>
Houston quarterback Warren Moon after the Oilers held off San Diego, 34-27: "We 
made too much of a game of it. . . . We just should have run away and hid." 
</P>
<P>
Ram quarterback Jim Everett on Eric Dickerson's return to Anaheim: "A lot of 
guys here involved in the trade wanted to do well because they knew the 
comparison would be made." 
</P>
<P>
Ram offensive tackle Irv Pankey, a friend of Dickerson's: "I wanted to see him 
do well but I wanted us to win the game. There are no hard feelings between 
(Eric) and the offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JUST REWARDS 
</P>
<P>
The timing couldn't have been more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
After Randall Cunningham passed for five touchdowns Sunday, to rally 
Philadelphia to a 42-37 victory over Washington, the fifth-year player 
announced that he had signed a five-year contract extension, assuring he'll be 
with the Eagles through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"Signed, sealed and delivered," said Cunningham, who passed for 447 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but team officials said Cunningham 
signed the extension at the team's hotel before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's the reason I played good today," said Cunningham, whose original 
contract was due to expire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
Denver at Buffalo, 6 p.m. -- If it were up to Jim Kelly, the Buffalo Bills 
would be throwing bombs from the opening snap. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Bills face the pass-oriented Denver Broncos tonight, it's not 
likely the Buffalo offense will be radically different. That's because the 
Bills' coaching staff dislikes the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the shotgun," Kelly said. "I love sending four receivers out on a pass 
play. . . . It reminds me of the USFL." 
</P>
<P>
It was with the USFL's Houston Gamblers that Kelly established himself as one 
of professional football's premier passers. But since he joined the Bills in 
1986, his passing has been restrained. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Bills' offense sputtered until the last 4:17 of the game when, 
from a shotgun formation, Kelly engineered two touchdowns as Buffalo defeated 
Miami, 27-24. Kelly scored the game-winner on a two-yard touchdown run, the 
first rushing touchdown of his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Denver's primary task will be to stop a Buffalo running game led 
by second-year pro Thurman Thomas, who rushed for 94 yards in the first week. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are coming off a 34-20 win over Kansas City. The Broncos' defense 
was the big surprise, accounting for 14 points on two interception returns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Eric Dorsey of the New York Giants had his foot stepped on in 
the fourth quarter of a 24-14 victory over Detroit. The the preliminary 
diagnosis was a broken bone in his right foot. Dorsey will be sidelined 
indefinitely. A similar injured has sidelined Giants running back Joe Morris 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Eddie Brown, in his first game since ending a contract holdout, 
left with a pulled groin muscle in the third quarter of Cincinnati's 41-10 rout 
of Pittsburgh. Brown is not expected to miss any games. Bengal running back 
Ickey Woods, who scored on a one-yard run in the second quarter, twisted his 
ankle in the second half and did not return.

ONE AND ONE ADDS UP PERFECTLY FOR ELLARD

<P>
It was a pregame pleasantry more than a plea, but Ram wide receiver Henry 
Ellard didn't seem to care. Asked by former teammate Eric Dickerson to "please 
don't kill us," Ellard did everything Sunday but place a toe tag on the 
Indianapolis Colts and their now-dazed and dazzled secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Colts contributed to their own demise with a defensive game plan 
that inexplicably matched Ellard against a single cornerback time and time 
again. "And let's face it," said Ram H-back Pete Holohan, "there's not many men 
in this league who can cover Henry one on one." 
</P>
<P>
Colt cornerback Chris Goode couldn't. Nor could John Baylor, who replaced a 
benched Goode in the second half. Nor could Eugene Daniel, who was considered 
the best of the bunch. Nobody could keep up with Ellard, which explains his 12 
receptions, his remarkable 230 yards and his three touchdowns -- all career 
highs. In fact, the yardage total was third best in Ram history. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best performance I've ever seen, bar none," said Holohan, who 
witnessed his share of the incredible while a member of the pass-happy San 
Diego Chargers. "You don't see numbers like that. What'd he have, 230? Oh my 
gawd." 
</P>
<P>
Unbelievable and fantastic are the words Ram Coach John Robinson used. 
</P>
<P>
"I just applauded," said Ram free safety Vince Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tossup what Colt coaches were muttering as Ellard crisscrossed the 
Anaheim Stadium turf at will. Expletives or superlatives? Shrills or thrills? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it was, the Colts had it coming, what with a scheme that practically 
invited Ram quarterback Jim Everett to throw to Ellard. Every time the Colts 
blitzed, which was often, Ellard found himself roaming free in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, as Ellard's totals increased, the Colts refused to alter their 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"They never changed anything," Ellard said. "They didn't really take away what 
we were doing. It was just a matter of me and Jim Everett playing catch from 
there on out." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard said the Rams knew early last week how they wanted to attack the Colt 
secondary. It was simple, really: wait for the blitz, look for the single 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
True to form, the Colts unveiled the same coverages they used last week against 
the San Francisco 49ers. And like last week, they lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a chance they were willing to take," Ellard said. 
</P>
<P>
By Goode's estimates, the Colts used one-on-one coverage "about 80%," which 
about equals Everett's completion rate. And while the blitz might have been a 
great idea at game's beginning, the strategy was doomed by the end of the first 
quarter. That's when Ellard said he felt he could do anything against the 
Colts. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he likened the whole experience to being a kid in an empty candy 
shop. "You walk in and you have your choice of everything and nobody's stopping 
you and you keep on going," he said. "That's kind of how it was." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Colts were in awe of the performance. Indianapolis wide receiver 
Clarence Verdin, who caught an 82-yard touchdown pass of his own Sunday, rushed 
up to Ellard at game's end. 
</P>
<P>
"You're the greatest, you're the best," he said, pumping Ellard's hand. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Verdin explained his reasons for the compliments. 
</P>
<P>
"Ellard, he runs routes," he said. "Jerry Rice (of the San Francisco 49ers), 
well, the passing offense is built around him. He basically does what he wants. 
With those two, I've got to give Ellard the upper hand." 
</P>
<P>
The assessment will be seconded by the Colt defensive backs. Goode, who 
returned to the lineup just three weeks ago after a lengthy holdout, was the 
most frequent target before being sent to the bench. Baylor fared no better. 
And Daniel, the other cornerback, was victimized, too. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a first ever for me," Goode said. "It was just one of those days. I'm 
sure I could have done better than I did today, but I was a step off and I 
could feel it." 
</P>
<P>
A step? Colt Coach Ron Meyer was less charitable. 
</P>
<P>
"For the second game in a row, we made a receiver an All-Pro," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard did his part. Best estimates had Ellard missing just two of the 14 
passes thrown his way. And it wasn't as if his 12 receptions were 10-yard 
down-and-out patterns. Ellard averaged more than 19 yards a catch. 
</P>
<P>
And so much for the ties that bind. Dickerson's friendly pregame chat, the one 
that begged for mercy, fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
"He did it anyway," Dickerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Against a Colt defense that gambled often, Ellard didn't have any choice.

NOTES: DONATIONS NOT FACTORED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business 
announced the results of a study a week ago showing that, contrary to other 
recent reports, junk bonds aren't excessively risky. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the school insist that there is absolutely no connection between 
the results of the study and the fact that Michael Milken, the former Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond chief, is an alumnus of the school and over the 
years has donated at least $2.25 million to it. 
</P>
<P>
The study by Wharton faculty members Marshall E. Blume and Donald B. Keim 
concluded that junk bonds issued in 1977 and 1978 yielded 8.5% in the 10 years 
after they were issued, after defaults on some of the bonds were factored in. 
They said this was a better return than on medium-term Treasury bonds in the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
Blume, reached by phone, said he was completely unaware that Milken had given 
money to Wharton.

NOTES: OFFICE IN HOTEL ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raise your hand if you know this story: You go away on a business trip. When 
you return, you are greeted by a pile of work that could have been done on the 
road if you had been able to see it. It's a problem all right. 
</P>
<P>
But to the owners of the Nob Hill Lambourne in San Francisco it's an 
opportunity to set their small month-old hotel apart in that competitive and 
overbuilt market. The hotel, whose rates range from $175 to $250 per night, 
offers fax machines, voice mail services and IBM personal computers in each of 
its 20 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel owners, who claim that their in-room services are a first in the United 
States, say guests appear interested in all the high-tech gizmos. However, few 
have made much use of the machines. "It's hard to tell exactly why," muses one 
clerk. "Maybe, they're too busy at night to get much work done."

THIRD WORLD'S MASSIVE DEBT GROWING WORSE; 
</P>
<P>
WORLD BANK REPORT SAYS ECONOMIC GROWTH MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Third World debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service their debts to the 
United States and other creditors last year than they received in new loans -- 
a major drain on their already cash-strapped economies -- the World Bank 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The figure, contained in the bank's annual report and made public before its 
annual meeting here Sept. 23, was almost a third larger than in 1987, when the 
net pay-back totaled $38.3 billion. The cash drain has been growing steadily 
since 1984, when it was $10.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The bank also reported that, despite the relatively buoyant economic growth in 
most industrial countries, developing countries turned in a decidedly mixed 
performance, ranging from a mini-boom in Southeast Asian economies to further 
impoverishment in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The bank said that it plans to increase its own commitments for new loans to 
Third World countries to about $16.4 billion in the current fiscal year, up 
from $14.8 billion in fiscal 1988. However, actual disbursements of loan money 
are expected to remain at about $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The figures on the cash drain showed that these "net resource transfers," as 
the bank parlance terms them, are mushrooming rapidly -- a measure of the 
mounting strain that the global debt burden is placing on Third World 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's total is approximately $7 billion higher than a preliminary estimate 
of $43 billion for 1988 that the bank published last December. "The situation 
in the Third World is getting worse, not better," a bank official said. 
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman said that part of the reason that the figure is so bloated is 
that some countries, such as cash-rich South Korea, are paying off their debts 
early. And the new U.S. plan to help countries reduce their debts is expected 
to trim the total some. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the figure is massive by any measure. The total debt burden of Third 
World countries currently is estimated at about $993 billion. The debt service 
for this total -- that is, the payments to cover interest and principal -- 
amounts to about $143 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
The bank gave a variety of reasons for the disparity in growth rates among 
developing countries. In general, however, it said that countries whose 
governments follow sensible economic policies, such as in East Asia, have 
attracted heavy new investment and have performed well. 
</P>
<P>
But others, such as those in Latin America, the Middle East and sub-Saharan 
Africa, that are heavily state-owned economies and consume more than they 
produce, have not. In particular, investment has lagged in these countries as 
residents have sent their capital abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The bank said the continuing deterioration in the debt situation underscores 
the need for further efforts by the industrial countries to help Third World 
governments pare back their debt -- a major aim of the U.S. plan offered by 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drain Began in 1984 
</P>
<P>
However, efforts under the Brady plan are going relatively slowly, and World 
Bank officials cautioned that the results may not show up for at least two or 
three more years. Some critics believe that the plan -- designed to let debtors 
swap debt for securities -- may have limited use. 
</P>
<P>
The net cash drain from the debtor countries to the richer ones began in 1984. 
Until then, the richer countries had provided more in new loans to Third World 
nations than those countries paid back. 
</P>
<P>
World Bank officials said the outflows are likely to prompt the institution to 
intensify its emphasis on programs that are designed to alleviate poverty, not 
just speed development. The bank also intends to step up lending for 
environmental projects.

VICTORIA'S SECRET WON'T KEEP SECRET ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Victoria's Secret has let the cat out of the bag. 
</P>
<P>
The Limited's successful lingerie business -- which has grown to 353 stores 
nationwide -- is about to launch its first national advertising campaign, with 
a 10-page glossy insert in magazines hitting the stands next month. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by the company and FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York, the 
advertising will appear in November issues of Elle, Vogue, Vanity Fair, 
Victoria, House Beautiful, Bon Appetit, New Woman and People magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Photographed primarily in Sledemere Castle in Yorkshire, England, the ad 
depicts a couple in romantic, but modest, situations and is meant to evoke the 
idea of "love in marriage," according to Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of 
FCB/Leber Katz Partners. 
</P>
<P>
The ad asks: "What do women really want? That's Victoria's Secret." The account 
director, appropriately enough, is named Victoria H. Alin. 
</P>
<P>
In the ad, the company will also announce its entry into the crowded toiletries 
and fragrance business, a line of Victoria's Secret products with an English 
country garden theme that ties in with the retailer's move toward store designs 
with a British look and feel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Departure for Firm 
</P>
<P>
National advertising marks a departure for Victoria's Secret, which the Limited 
bought in 1982 when it consisted of a money-losing catalogue operation and four 
small stores. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has kept a low advertising profile, the business, founded in San 
Francisco in 1977 by Roy L. Raymond, has boomed under the Limited's ownership 
because of the strength of its catalogue, word of mouth and sporadic ads in 
fashion publications. By one industry analyst's estimate, Victoria's Secret has 
$340 million in annual sales. (The Limited does not disclose sales for its 
divisions.) 
</P>
<P>
"We are of a size now at Victoria's Secret that we are in all of the major 
markets in the United States," said Alfred S. Dietzel, vice president of the 
Limited, a big specialty retailing company based in Columbus, Ohio. "Now, an 
advertising campaign makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
Dietzel said the advertising is a test. If it works for Victoria's Secret, 
other Limited divisions -- such as Limited and Express -- might be good 
candidates for national ad campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Sosnick, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Capital in New York, said 
Victoria's Secret's growth has "probably been the fastest from start to 
dominance of any chain in the history of retailing." He calls it the nation's 
largest specialist in women's lingerie and "a star in profitability." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger Stores 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the company has revamped the look of its stores. About 50 of them now 
have "an English feel," Dietzel said. The stores also sell some menswear and 
sheets, pillow cases and towels. 
</P>
<P>
The stores, which once averaged about 1,400 square feet, have been getting 
bigger. Sites being secured now are in the range of 4,000 to 4,500 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Victoria's Secret catalogue has been growing even faster than 
the company as a whole, Sosnick said. The mail-order business is run separately 
and carries some sportswear and other merchandise not available in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
Sosnick expects that the chain will end the year with as many as 395 stores, 
with sales "a tad under $500 million."

Argentina to Offer New Oil Licenses: Argentina is planning to offer licenses to 
search for and extract oil in 100 new areas as part of a policy to attract 
foreign investment, a government official said. The Noticias Argentinas news 
agency reported Secretary for Economic Coordination Orlando Ferreres as saying 
a program would encourage foreign companies to participate in the exploitation 
of other minerals. Since the government of President Carlos Menem took office 
in July, Argentina has awarded 25 contracts to private domestic and foreign oil 
companies to search for oil in marginal lands.

Air France, Lufthansa Extend Agreements: Air France and West Germany's 
Lufthansa agreed to cooperate on everything from catering to aircraft purchases 
in a move designed to better prepare two of the world's biggest airlines for 
the year 2000. Under the terms of the deal, each airline will maintain its 
separate identity and continue to compete for most routes. But they will extend 
existing cooperation agreements -- including reservation systems, aircraft 
maintenance and flights to West Berlin -- to cover sales forces abroad, a new 
catering unit, new long-haul and regional routes and joint negotiations with 
aircraft makers.

unsuccessful approach to Japan and advising them on how to make inroads there. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent you do your homework, a foreign company can be successful," 
Atarashi told a recent gathering of U.S. and Japanese businessmen in Los 
Angeles. He is one of a growing number of Japanese executives who have taken an 
uncharacteristic high profile in admonishing American businesses about their 
poor showing in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Atarashi suggested ways that U.S.-based firms could take the offensive in the 
Japanese market. He described how small packaging and design changes for 
Johnson &amp; Johnson products made significant differences in Japanese sales. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1959, Atarashi, 53, has worked for Shell Oil Co., Coca-Cola (Japan), then 
joined Johnson &amp; Johnson's Japanese unit in Tokyo in 1978. He said American 
firms face five common problems in Japan: 
</P>
<P>
* Absence of a corporate philosophy in the head office that spells out a "value 
system" for the entire company. "Typically," he explained, "no corporate 
philosophy is communicated to the Japanese subsidiaries." 
</P>
<P>
* Ignorance in the head office. "American business executives have tended 
historically not to have much knowledge about Japan." 
</P>
<P>
* Poor foreign management. He said that American firms tend to assign to Japan 
second-class executives or those passed over in home-office politics -- the 
"losers." 
</P>
<P>
* Frequent changes in top management because of short-term expectations for 
profit and sales. Atarashi advised that companies wait at least three years to 
evaluate an individual manager's performance in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
* Difficulty in attracting and maintaining high-caliber Japanese employees. 
"With the exception of IBM, foreign companies have had difficulty in keeping 
Japanese staff" because of compensation, management standards and opportunities 
for overseas experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese consumers are exceptionally demanding of product and packaging," he 
explained. "You need to adapt a product (for the Japanese) regardless of its 
success in the home country." Such adaptations should take into account the 
Japanese perceptions of value, appearance, availability and service. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced its Reach toothbrush in Japan in 1981, 
designers shortened it by 5 millimeters and gave it a thinner handle with a 
hook for hanging and offered three bristle types instead of two, as in the 
United States. The Japanese model came in a transparent package; the U.S. model 
was in a solid pack. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent one year and significant money to make sure the product met specific 
needs," Atarashi said of the Reach toothbrush, which has 9% of the $400-million 
toothbrush market in Japan and is the No. 1 seller in the premium toothbrush 
category.

FAIR GAMBLES ON A BIG PONY SHOW

Los Angeles County Fair officials have placed their bets for the future. And 
the money's on horses. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next year, the 487-acre fairgrounds will include a modern equestrian 
complex, including an 800-seat horse auction pavilion, adjacent show rings and 
nine new barns capable of housing 504 horses. The additional stables will 
increase the permanent horse-keeping capacity at the fairgrounds to 1,199. 
</P>
<P>
The $13-million facility, a joint venture between the fair association and a 
private developer, is expected to be the largest such complex west of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
But more importantly, the complex is expected to generate millions of dollars 
worth of sales of thoroughbred horses, primarily, it is believed, to Pacific 
Rim investors anxiously awaiting an auction in the western United States, a 
little closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
According to fair officials, thoroughbred sales in California have slipped from 
an all-time high of $48 million in 1984 to about $25 million last year. Their 
goal is to erase the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald F. McMahon, formerly head of sales for the California Thoroughbred 
Breeders Assn., has been picked to manage the auction facility. 
</P>
<P>
The stables are already finished and the sales pavilion is scheduled for 
completion early next year. The first auction of 2-year-olds has been set for 
March 5-6, the days immediately following the Santa Anita Handicap race. 
Additional auctions have been scheduled for May, July, October and December. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the equestrian center, fair officials are finishing plans for a 
250-room hotel and exhibition center designed to attract smaller trade shows. 
The new facility, expected to be completed in the early 1990s, will put the 
fair complex in direct competition for trade show business with smaller nearby 
convention centers in Pasadena and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Hinds, chief executive of the fair association, said the fairgrounds will 
not compete for business with larger convention centers, such as those in Los 
Angeles, Anaheim and Long Beach, because those facilities typically attract 
shows requiring hotel bookings of 1,000 rooms or more. CARLA LAZZARESCHI

ALL'S FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be fooled by all the fun and games: Fairs are big business in California. 
According to the Western Fair Assn. in Sacramento, fairs are the state's 47th 
largest industry and generate more than $60 million worth of sales tax revenue 
for state and local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 81 fairs are held each year in 54 of the state's 58 counties. (Alpine, 
Mono, Sierra and Alpine counties are not home to any fairs.) 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County fair is by far the largest, attracting about 1.4 million 
visitors last year. Not even close behind in second place is the San Diego 
County Fair at Del Mar, which had slightly more than 1 million visitors this 
summer. They are followed, in order, by the Santa Clara County Fair, the 
California State Fair and the Orange County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the largest fair of any kind last year was the Ohio State Fair, 
which attracted 3.3 million visitors. Texas was in second place with 2.9 
million visitors. In 1985, the last recorded census, fairs nationwide attracted 
158 million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Although no documentation exists, the first state fair is believed to have been 
held in the early 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, community fairs have been a great place to exhibit new products 
and technologies as well as prize pigs and heifers. Among those items first 
unveiled at a county fair are: Ford Motor Co.'s Edsel, the light bulb and the 
phonograph. 
</P>
<P>
What's a fair without a queen? Plenty, the Los Angeles County Fair sponsors 
decreed about 10 years ago when they decided that the annual beauty contest was 
not in keeping with "the changing times." Still, plenty of other fairs stick 
with tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The Yolo County Fair is home court to the Sugar Beet Queen. And Queen 
Scheherazade, complete with her two-piece, navel-baring belly dancer get-up, 
presides over the National Date Festival held annually in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
But few regal misses have it over Princess Kay of the Milky Way, who is crowned 
each year at the Minnesota State Fair. Part of the prize for the princess and 
her court of six maidens is an opportunity to spend the day in a 38-degree, 
glass-walled refrigerator posing for a sculptor who carves each of their 
likenesses in a 100-pound slab of butter. 
</P>
<P>
They're back!! Yes, those ever popular pig races -- that's right, your eyes do 
not deceive -- are off and running again this year at the Los Angeles County 
Fair. Called the "Rapid Razorback" event, the race features "road hogs" 
speeding around a miniature track. Races are held several times a day. 
Pari-mutuel betting is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The 62nd Los Angeles County Fair runs through Oct. 1 at the fairgrounds in 
Pomona. The grounds are about 2 miles north of Interstate 10 and can be reached 
from either the Ganesha or Garey exits. Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday; 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Fridays; 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturdays and 9 
a.m. to 10 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $7 for adults, $5.50 for adults over age 
60 and $4 for children aged 6 to 12. Children under 6 are admitted free. 
Parking is $3 general, $5 for preferred and $8 for valet.

<P>
COUNTY EXPOSITIONS, WHILE STILL FEATURING PIE-EATING AND GIRDLE-LACING 
CONTESTS, ARE BECOMING MORE COMMERCIAL 
</P>

<P>
Tucked away in a corner of the sprawling central exhibition hall at the Los 
Angeles County Fair in Pomona is a quiet testimony to the origins of this 
annual celebration of agriculture and merry-making: four tiny booths 
painstakingly decorated in true homespun fashion by local Grange clubs. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the San Dimas Grange -- why this affluent eastern county suburb 
still has a Grange remains a mystery -- has chosen to depict a winter camp 
scene, complete with an ice skater, sleigh and open-air fire. It's a shrine to 
the nation's rural roots and the pleasures of a simpler time. 
</P>
<P>
Although the booths are tiny and easily overlooked, the four Grange displays 
stand out amid the hoopla of the nearby fudge-making exhibit, wine-tasting 
pavilion and other commercial clutter. They are among the last traces of what 
the Los Angeles County Fair -- the largest fair in California and the sixth 
largest of the 3,238 held each year throughout the nation -- used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become pretty commercialized," muses Howard Wagner, a retired school 
maintenance supervisor who has worked in the San Dimas Grange booth in each of 
the past 30 years. "When I started here, Orange Julius was the only booth in 
the hall that sold something. All the rest were exhibiting, mostly citrus." 
</P>
<P>
To compare this year's fair, which closes Oct. 1, to those of three decades ago 
is mixing apples and oranges. The current event, whose theme is "America's 
County Fair," is big business. 
</P>
<P>
And it's getting even bigger. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Los Angeles County Fair generated revenue of about $19.1 
million, the equivalent of more than $1 million for each of the 18 days that 
the fair was open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helps Pay the Bills 
</P>
<P>
And that's just when the fair was running at full speed. Increasingly, 
Fairplex, as the 487-acre complex in the hills along the eastern edge of Pomona 
is now named, is home to a variety of special events and consumer shows during 
the remaining 11 1/2 months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense for facilities of this size to sit idle and wait for 
fair time every year," says Ralph Hinds, chief executive of the county fair 
association. "We need the other uses to help pay the bills." 
</P>
<P>
Mirroring a nationwide trend to exploit the full money-making potential of 
these huge complexes, last year the fairgrounds generated nearly $2.3 million 
in rental fees for hosting 127 events. Among them were the National Hot Rod 
Assn.'s Winternationals, the Winston World Finals of Drag Racing, the Mission 
Circuit Dog Show, the L.A. Home &amp; Garden Show, the Western States Toy &amp; 
Hobby Show and the Great Entrepreneur &amp; Franchise Show. 
</P>
<P>
There's even more going on at Fairplex. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department uses the main parking lot -- which holds a sizable portion of the 
complex's 45,197 paved parking spots -- for high-speed driving instruction. 
Technicians for Hot Rod, Car &amp; Driver and Motor Trend magazines use the 
parking lot for their annual evaluations of new cars, and Mazda and Toyota 
engineers use it for test drives. 
</P>
<P>
And even more is on the way early next year when the new, $13-million 
equestrian complex, designed to be the largest west of Kentucky, is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The fairgrounds saw its first non-fair use during World War II, initially as a 
detention center for Japanese-Americans who were eventually relocated to 
Wyoming, and later as home to troops in the U.S. 4th Army. 
</P>
<P>
The big push into year-around use began in 1982 with the $4-million renovation 
of the 105,000-square-foot central exhibition hall, the largest single-span 
building west of the Mississippi. In the ensuing years, much more has been 
done, including the addition of a 184-space recreational vehicle park and 
convenience store on the fairgrounds and a massive re-landscaping and 
face-lifting for the plazas encircling the central exhibition complex just 
inside Gate 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draws Huge Crowds 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increasing emphasis on year-around use of Fairplex, to most 
Southern Californians, the fairgrounds mean only one thing: the fair. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Fair traces its roots to a commercial and industrial 
show held along the Southern Pacific siding in downtown Pomona in 1921. The 
show proved so popular that a group of local businessmen launched a grander 
version the following year and called it the county fair. It has been held 
annually ever since, except from 1942 through 1947 due to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the fair attracted nearly 1.4 million visitors, almost equaling the 
record set in 1985. There were nearly 1,400 commercial booths that generated 
total sales of $9.3 million, including 200 or so food and beverage stands that 
enjoyed record sales of nearly $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although no scientific study of the subject has been done, fair experts 
throughout the nation agree that livestock and animal exhibits are the most 
popular attractions at county and state fairs these days. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no other place to take kids to show them farming activities and pieces 
of rural life," says Lewis Miller, executive vice president of the 
International Assn. of Fairs &amp; Expositions in Springfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, exhibits range from semi-precious gems to working bee hives to the 
traditional assortment of jams and jellies. Of course there is the expected 
complement of clowns, circus acts and fireworks. Thoroughbred racing, complete 
with pari-mutuel betting, runs throughout the fair. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the 900 or so contests, among the features that have gained 
the Los Angeles County Fair a national reputation for innovation. They include 
the usual competitions in pie making, cake decorating and sheep shearing, and 
several off-beat contests, such as girdle lacing and making home-brewed beer. 
</P>
<P>
It's these contests, exhibits and wackiness, argues Stephen Chambers, executive 
director of the Western Fairs Assn. in Sacramento, that capture the essence of 
what fairs are all about. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that fairs have become more businesslike, and they will continue to 
become even more like businesses," Chambers says. "But in the end, fairs are 
not about business. We're here to celebrate everyday life and the ordinary 
accomplishments of people. Theme parks are businesses. We're about people."

Riding high, the CBS miniseries "Lonesome Dove" corralled six awards Saturday 
night in the first round of the 41st annual Emmy Awards.

SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE-ALMOST; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN THE SURPRISES FAIL TO ENLIVEN TV'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

It's the Emmyzzzzzzz. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There were jolts -- "Lonesome Dove" losing to "War and Remembrance" and getting 
nearly shut out in the non-technical categories, and James Woods topping both 
Robert Duvall and John Gielgud for best special or miniseries actor. 
</P>
<P>
What a sad irony, however, that on the 50th birthday of American television, 
the program whose sole purpose is to honor television should be such a 
monotone. And what an irony also that Fox Broadcasting, a network that 
rightfully prides itself on being different and innovative -- from "The Tracey 
Ullman Show" to "America's Most Wanted" to "Married . . . With Children" -- 
should produce an Emmycast that was so ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
At just under three hours, it was on time, but not on target. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Walter Miller and produced by John C. Moffitt and Pat Tourk Lee 
("Not Necessarily the News"), Sunday night's program was not only largely flat 
and tedious, it was disjointed and critically in need of a single host, someone 
-- but not Milton Berle, all right? -- to tell some jokes and provide cohesion. 
There have been hosts for past Emmycasts -- although not last year -- and a 
return to the old ways is in order. 
</P>
<P>
The way comedy/variety show winner Ullman characterized the behind-the-scenes 
chaos on her own show on Fox applied to the Emmycast: "It's not funny . . . it 
could be funny . . . it's getting better." But not much. 
</P>
<P>
Even a singing Snow White would have been welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the old clips zinged. But otherwise the evening was so . . . 
perfunctory, more or less consisting of awards being announced and accepted 
without much zest or style (Annie Potts of "Designing Women" being an 
exception). Even a tribute to Governors Award winner Lucille Ball -- which 
should been the evening's emotional centerpiece -- lacked passion. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone saved the night, ironically, it was the no-shows, the seven winners 
who weren't present to accept their awards. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
By not showing up, they allowed Fox to hilariously simulate their acceptance 
speeches. The "acceptance" by HBO's "Tanner '88" directing winner Robert Altman 
-- a spoof of the controversial ABC News simulation of suspected spy Felix 
Bloch allegedly handing over government material to a Soviet agent -- was 
especially brilliant. If only the entire Emmycast would have been simulated. 
</P>
<P>
Surely the evening's biggest surprise was the Emmy that went to ABC's 29-hour 
"War and Remembrance," a towering achievement whose extravagant cost -- 
compared with relatively moderate ratings -- has been cited as putting a chill 
on long-form miniseries. "War and Remembrance" was expected to lose to the 
more-popular CBS miniseries "Lonesome Dove." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major shock," exclaimed "War and Remembrance" 
director/producer/co-writer Dan Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, many had the same reaction to that fine actor Woods winning for 
his performance in the overrated "Bill W." on ABC. It was good work, but not in 
a class with expected winner Duvall as the aging plainsman in "Lonesome Dove" 
or with Gielgud's heroic performance as Aaron Jastrow in "War and Remembrance." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Emmycast itself was not in much of any class. Next year, leave a 
wake-up call.

EMMY'S FASHION STATEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
SOME THINGS OLD, SOME THINGS BORROWED, SOME THINGS NEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Second Hand Rose would have been proud of the number of vintage, borrowed and 
home-sewn gowns that distinguished the 41st annual Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The attendees, in general, were better dressed this year than in years past. 
Most were no doubt grateful that the weekend's clouds dissipated and raincoats 
weren't needed. The usual supply of bridesmaid gowns and tarty, tasteless togs 
were in relatively short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Only one fashion disaster occurred. Daphne Reid, who stars with her husband, 
Tim Reid, in the new CBS series "Snoops," was among the first to arrive. Her 
long, glittering emerald-green gown with a diamond back cutout was a stunner, 
but she fell victim to the incident every woman dreads: Another woman showed up 
in the same gown hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Harris of ABC's "thirtysomething" wore a black French lace gown from the 
'40s that she purchased at Framm's. Harris said co-star Patricia Wettig 
introduced her to the store. Wettig, who arrived with co-star and husband Ken 
Olin, also purchased her vintage beaded butterscotch dress at Framm's, but the 
two didn't buy them together. 
</P>
<P>
Another fan of historic chic is Dana Delany, who stars in ABC's "China Beach." 
Delany wore a very sexy form-fitting black dress with chiffon sleeves by the 
late Giorgio Sant'Angelo. Though it was new, not all of her personal clothing 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Newly slender Susan Ruttan of NBC's "L.A. Law" sketched her bronze-and-black 
short dress wrapped with a black net shawl and had friend Dovie Hein make it 
for her. Ruttan, who has lost "thirtysomething" pounds and has tinted her hair 
a deeper shade of red, looked radiant. 
</P>
<P>
A friend also made NBC "Golden Girls" Rue McClanahan's black velvet dress with 
a matching jacket trimmed in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Ford, who plays beauty-queen-turned-reporter Corky Sherwood on CBS' 
"Murphy Brown," said she helped design her burgundy velvet gown along with the 
show's costumer Bill Hargate. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion plate Candice Bergen, a.k.a. "Murphy Brown" on the CBS television 
series, wore an au courant animal print full-length gown designed by Bill 
Blass. Anjelica Huston also went with her animal instinct in a sexy, leopard 
printed number. 
</P>
<P>
"thirtysomething's" Melanie Mayron almost had on a gold strapless mini topped 
with a black long-sleeve jacket. Because the dress kept slipping down, Mayron 
commented on the air that she hoped it would stay up. 
</P>
<P>
Irreverent designer Franco Moschino was the choice of Diane Lane, who appeared 
in "Lonesome Dove." Lane wore a black slim suit with witty buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna Frank of NBC's "L.A. Law" wore a gold Ungaro jacket and a black dress 
that she borrowed from her mother. She arrived with husband and co-star Alan 
Rachins. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Duvall opted for Western chic in keeping with his part in CBS' "Lonesome 
Dove." Duvall wore a brown tuxedo with a black leather tie designed and made by 
Manuel, who is based in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-bizarre Tracey Ullman continues to patronize English designers. The 
variety show star wore a black David Fielding dress with a witty headpiece. 
Ullman said Fielding shipped the dress to her from London. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a loaner. Put that in," she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine Guy glided up the steps in a white silk short dress with hemline 
flounces. Guy, who plays the snippy Whitley in the NBC sitcom "Different 
World," said her character's fashion taste bears little resemblance to that of 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
"We have totally different tastes. My character is more of an Anne Klein kind 
of girl, but my tastes run a little funkier," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Eikenberry, another member of NBC's "L.A. Law" cast, arrived with 
husband/co-star Michael Tucker in a gown from favorite designer Bob Mackie. 
Tucker, who favors unusual tuxedo shirts, wore a white shirt with interesting 
pleat treatments by Hugo Boss, whose suits are often featured on the hourlong 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Perlman of NBC's "Beauty and the Beast" arrived dressed in his usual 
romantic mode with an elegant Gianni Versace ensemble, distinguished by a cream 
tuxedo shirt worn without a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Swit was a regular lady in red in her floor-length gown, which she 
purchased at Fred Hayman Beverly Hills. Swit agreed that in past years she has 
worn the de rigueur black but wanted something "a little livelier" this year. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dramatic fashion selection was the black and gold gown worn by 
Betty White of NBC's "Golden Girls." 
</P>
<P>
"I got it at Elizabeth Arden," she said. "It grabbed me while I was having my 
hair done."

COUNTRY JOE CAPTURES WHIFF OF TROUBLED '60S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even with two decades to buffer the change, it has to be a spirit-wrenching 
experience for Country Joe McDonald to have gone from galvanizing a 
half-million people at Woodstock to playing before less than a 10,000th that 
number (we're talking about some 40 persons here) at Huntington Beach's Night 
Moves on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But the psychedelic-era veteran opened a solo acoustic show with his 
"Entertainment Is My Business," which, rather than the cynicism or hackdom that 
title might suggest, was defined by McDonald's ensuing performance as a 
tenacious statement of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tiny -- and in some quarters noisily inattentive -- audience, the 
singer-guitarist still tried as hard to connect as he did in the days when 
folks got arrested for doing his "Fish Cheer" counterculture rallying cry. 
</P>
<P>
Where he once painted his face with Day-Glo flowers and sported combat 
fatigues, on Saturday McDonald looked for all the world as if he had stepped 
out of a Montgomery Ward Father's Day ad, dressed in casual, nondescript 
sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
But the anti-war protest "Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag" and other of his 
'60s works still held pleasingly nostalgic whiffs of patchouli, including 
"Janis," "Here I Go Again" and "Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine." 
</P>
<P>
The instrumental "Section 43" from the 1967 debut "Electric Music for the Mind 
and Body," and a more recent guitar-and-harmonica piece fared less well, being 
neither compositionally nor instrumentally engaging enough to sustain the time 
they were given. 
</P>
<P>
The show's few lapses did seem to come in pairs, with songs about Florence 
Nightingale and Red Cross founder Clara Barton adding up to perhaps one more 
tune about nursing than was needed. Similarly, the back-to-back performance of 
"White Powder" and "Cocaine" only diluted the anti-drug slant of each. 
</P>
<P>
Though he obliged fans expecting his '60s-radical anthems, McDonald very much 
remained a potent topical troubadour. He brought out the timeliness of Woody 
Guthrie's Depression-era "Talking Dust Bowl Blues" with its tales of hard times 
and underfed kids who "looked like a tribe of thermometers running around." 
</P>
<P>
A Navy vet himself, McDonald has been active for decades in veterans' causes, 
and his strongest song of the evening was "Go Go Johnny Rambo," a biting slap 
at the way America embraces the Stallone interpretation of the Vietnam 
experience while ignoring the vets themselves, declaring "Loving Johnny is so 
easy, because he's only a fantasy."

PACIFIC SYMPHONY ENDS ITS SUMMER CONCERTS WITH -- LITERALLY -- A BANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony closed its summer series on Saturday with a Tchaikovsky 
evening marked by grace, good humor and a few theatrics. And, oh yes, there was 
some stylish music as well. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lighter moments of the event, at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 
were intentional: John Santana, late of KFAC (or should that be of the late 
KFAC?), announced that there would be a much-beloved mystery guest conductor 
for the introductory "Star-Spangled Banner." It was he -- and he was a lusty 
leader at that. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those lighter moments were not intentional: overzealous applause 
between the second and third movements of the "Sleeping Beauty" suite prompted 
the entire Huntington Beach Concert Band to emerge prematurely for the "1812" 
Overture that was to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Toshiyuki Shimada good-naturedly turned them back, then signaled the 
audience to expect two more movements from the ballet piece. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble was frequently infected by Shimada's energy, and in the ballet 
suite and the "1812" Overture in particular, it paid heed to his commands for 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, however, the ensemble did not heed their conductor's indications, 
allowing, for instance, a tubby string accompaniment to overshadow Leanne 
Becknell's elegant oboe solo in "Capriccio italien." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Shimada was not consistent in his demands for expression. In the opening 
Allegro of the Piano Concerto in B-flat minor, he failed to persuade the 
orchestra to match the expressive level of soloist Leonid Kuzmin. 
</P>
<P>
Kuzmin executed the crowd-pleasing chordal passages with bravura and elan, and 
he seemed to take much more enjoyment in the music than did his more sober 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The microphone arrangement also conspired against advantageous balance in the 
concerto. As on previous occasions this summer, a microphone was aimed directly 
into the piano, permitting it to dominate at all times. In the second movement, 
every twitter in the piano overshadowed solos within the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The "1812" Overture, plumped up with the band, cannons and fireworks, left the 
9,138 attendees literally shaking in their seats.

Billy Barty -- at 3 feet 9 inches, one of the nation's best-known little people 
-- believes that TV's small screen can be a great equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
Come Saturday night, when his comedy-variety series "Short Ribbs" debuts on 
Orange County's KDOC-TV Channel 56, Barty, 65, hopes the half-hour show will 
enable other little people "to act like regular people." 
</P>
<P>
For the last 60 years, Barty has played most parts available to small-statured 
actors in show business, including more than 200 movies, from "Gold Diggers of 
1933" to "UHF," now playing in theaters. He just returned from shooting a 
miniseries in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Barty said last week that he wants "Short Ribbs," besides providing 
entertainment to viewers, to offer other little people in show business roles 
for which they will not be required to be "foils" or to perform in ridiculous 
costumes, as he has had to do so many times in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-week series, underwritten in part by 7-Up of Los Angeles, is aimed at 
syndication, according to KDOC's general manager, Calvin Brack. The station is 
co-producing the series, along with Billy Barty Productions. The show is be 
shot and edited at the station's Anaheim studios, heretofore best known as the 
home of Wally George. 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken talk-show host makes a cameo appearance in an early episode, 
already shot, in which he plays an impatient therapist with a propensity for 
"short" jokes. There will be other "big" celebrity guests, Barty said, but not 
in the early episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the people to see what little people can do first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barty said that the weekly half-hour series, airing at 8:30 p.m., will lean 
heavily on spoofs of other TV series and performers. Reporters were invited to 
watch last week as the show's regular ensemble -- all under 4 feet, 5 inches -- 
rehearsed a takeoff called "Small Claims Court," with Barty as the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Another recurring character, also played by Barty, is a consumer reporter named 
David Halfowitz. The other cast members, Patty Maloney, Jimmy Briscoe and Joe 
Gieb, are all veterans of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. 
</P>
<P>
Barty founded the Little People of America in 1957 to increase understanding, 
and the Billy Barty Foundation in 1975 to raise aid money. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Barty planned to record a fund-raising anthem called "From Where 
I Stand," with little people and celebrities. Proceeds from the single and 
video are earmarked for scholarships and medical benefits, Barty said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short Ribbs" debuts Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. on KDOC Channel 56, Anaheim.

'MEDIA TALK' AT BANK'S GALLERY MAKES SOME STRONG COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a great treat to see the first-class art that Security Pacific Gallery 
assembled for its inaugural exhibition last summer. Still, as someone in the 
museum world remarked to me, it's one thing for the bank's exhibition space to 
show formally attractive work that's essentially uninvolved with social issues 
and another to curate an exhibition with real bite. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Security Pacific's new exhibit of painting, photography, installation and 
video art, "Media Talk" (through Oct. 29), is not only intelligently conceived 
and chockablock with strong, thoughtful work, it even dares to present (in a 
videotape) the viewpoint of a strongly anti-capitalist social critic. 
</P>
<P>
As arts writer Irene Borger notes in a catalogue essay rich in provocative 
aphorisms, media culture is both "seductive" and "invasive." So beguiling and 
so ubiquitous are the images and messages of TV and print that we absorb them 
without realizing it. We accept them easily; they speak with the soothing, 
authoritative voices of Truth. 
</P>
<P>
What they lack, of course, is sober, time-consuming analysis. That's what the 
artists in this show supply, in partnership with you, the viewer. You do have 
to take the time to digest and decipher this work; it doesn't just glide into 
your consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Curator Mark Johnstone has assembled an extremely varied group of American 
artists for this show. Some co-opt the look of media imagery; others dissect 
the workings of media on our minds; and still others are concerned with the 
technological aspects of the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Erika Rothenberg -- whose satirical exhibit "America, the Perfect County," is 
at Newport Harbor Art Museum through Sunday -- contributes three 
tongue-in-cheek paintings and an installation to this exhibit. Her "Celebrity 
Simulator" allows viewers to step onto a microphone-encrusted red podium and be 
broadcast to a TV set positioned in a roomful of furniture. The paintings are 
done in a simple, cheery, colorful style, and they are garnished with the kinds 
of imposing statistics the media bombards us with daily. In "Talk Shows," for 
instance, a smiling mouth with gritted teeth is juxtaposed with a text 
revealing a mind-boggling "fact": "America's 3,641 talk shows will need 8,912 
guests today." 
</P>
<P>
Martine Aballea creates parodies of advertising messages with hand-tinted bland 
photographs and deliciously weird texts. "Luminous Sauce . . . a velvety 
appetizing radiance" reads the slogan, in flowing script, that accompanies a 
nocturnal view of an urban building with bright colored lights in the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Heinecken's photographs combine fragments of advertising images 
featuring stereotypically sexy women. On the one hand, the works create a 
kaleidoscopic sensual impact of their own; on the other, their visual density 
involves the viewer in a closer examination of the insidious way the ads work 
on the psyche. 
</P>
<P>
Kathe Burkhart's vulgarly colored billboard-like paintings are deadpan paeans 
to the the visual language of Hollywood movie ads. A selection from her "Liz 
Taylor" series presents the star in scenes from "Little Women," "Butterfield 8" 
and other movies. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Rath has hooked up a group of "electronic sculptures," small TV screens 
with their electronic workings plainly in view, that display deliberately 
simple, continuously repeating imagery. In "Pow II," a hand slowly, jerkily 
forms a fist. In "Ambivalent Desire," three screens show blue images of hands 
tentatively stroking unseen objects. 
</P>
<P>
The poignancy stems from the disjunction between the "coldness" of the 
electronic devices and the human warmth of a small personal gesture. But there 
are several notions at work here -- among them, the way TV homes in on and 
magnifies images of violence and sensuality, and the sheer repetitiousness of 
TV imagery. 
</P>
<P>
Other works by Rath have no human subjects. These pieces reveal the electronic 
process as a stuttering, self-contradictory monologue ("(Not) Broken" -- in 
which the title words interrupt static patterns on two small screens") and as a 
simple-minded binary system ("Arecibo," in which a TV screen keeps flashing the 
number sequence 0, 1). 
</P>
<P>
H. Terry Braunstein is represented in an avalanche of work, all involving 
advertising imagery introduced into an alien context. The niftiest batch is 
"Adolescent Series II," photographs of goofy table-top "experiments." In one, a 
wide-eyed kid peers down a cardboard tube at The Future: a tiny couple with a 
baby carriage. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Bowers' "Dance of Life" doesn't seem to have much to do with the theme of 
the exhibit, but perhaps the point is the way it imitates a succession of movie 
frames with unlikely subjects. Each shot in this series of eight-foot-high 
color photographic prints of a robe and a jacket lying on a bed brings the two 
garments slightly closer together until they seem to embrace. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Flax summons up numbing repetitions of imagery and words in her 
computer-created ink-jet prints. In her most effective pieces, this visual 
static suggests the gap between the complexity and rawness of real-life 
emotions and the simple-minded media messages that stereotype aspects of family 
life or teen-age rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Niemanas' large multiple-image silver gelatin prints are hard to get a 
handle on, but they seem to be about the way media culture creates its own 
heroes and heroines and tends to see literary and artistic heroes of the past 
simply as grist for the mill of lowest-common-denominator taste. In Niemanas' 
"The Copy," a see-through silhouette of Michelangelo's "David" is ignobly made 
to appear as though it holds popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit also includes four videos, which visitors can ask to see. Chip 
Lord's "Not Top Gun" is billed as a critique of the militaristic values in the 
movie; it juxtaposes facts about American military spending with images from 
the "Top Gun" music video. 
</P>
<P>
"Political Advertisements," by Antonio Muntadas and Marshall Reese, is a 
compilation of selected TV political commercials made for the 1988 Presidential 
election, allowing the viewer to assess how Madison Avenue changed its approach 
as the nature of the campaign shifted. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Simon's "Production Notes: Fast Food for Thought" zips through seven TV 
commercials, beginning with a 60-second McDonald's spot set in a high school, 
and then (with the cost of the ad superimposed on the screen) takes the 
listener through the ad agency's blow-by-blow description of the relevance and 
meaning of each scene. The video is needlessly repetitious, but it does present 
a chilling look at all the calculation that goes into insidiously cheerful, 
low-key commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Williamson, the social critic mentioned previously, took a trip to a 
Target store for her video, "Judith Williamson Consumes Passionately in 
Southern California." She is a better writer than video maker or performer (the 
piece is overlong and fairly choppy, and she seems shy and nervous), but her 
analysis is keen. Beginning with "The Advertisement" -- a Burlington sock ad -- 
she muses on the absurdity of our "multiplicity of products and functions" that 
requires industry to dream up new consumer needs. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson notes that these needs are "all centered on the body," which 
capitalism examines piece by piece in its search for new areas to "colonize." 
She says the illusion of a vast array of products that are markedly different 
from one another -- such as the row upon row of socks at the Target store -- 
are substitutes for our inability to assimilate real differences, such as those 
of race or culture. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you agree or disagree, this is provocative material relevant to our 
lives -- and not at all what you'd expect to see at a bank! 
</P>
<P>
 "Media Talk" will be on view through Oct. 29 at Security Pacific Gallery, 555 
Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through 
Sunday. Admission is free, and the gallery will validate parking. Information: 
(714) 433-6001.

STUDENT, 15, TAKES 11 CLASSMATES HOSTAGE

A 15-year-old straight-A student armed with a shotgun, a .357-magnum and an 
automatic pistol stalked into a high school classroom, fired a shot into the 
ceiling and wall and took 11 classmates hostage today. 
</P>
<P>
He later released all but three hostages, and police said his only request was 
to speak to his father. 
</P>
<P>
Although several shots were fired, including one at a television news 
helicopter, no injuries were reported in the incident, which began at about 
9:50 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The youth "said he wasn't going to hurt nobody," according to Craig Eversole, a 
classmate who was the last to be released. "He said he wasn't going to shoot 
nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Police Trooper Ed Robinson also said the teen-ager apparently had held one 
hostage overnight -- the son of school Principal Betty Bond. He said that the 
two boys arrived at school in the younger Bond's red pickup and that it 
appeared that the armed youth had been holding the principal's son since the 
night before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newcomer From California 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear why the youth took over the classroom at Jackson County High 
School. Authorities described him as a newcomer from California who was living 
with his grandparents, but some students said they had known him for years. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said his only request was to speak with his father in Florida. Police 
contacted the father through a friend in Delray Beach, Fla., but did not say 
whether the boy was allowed to speak to him. 
</P>
<P>
Eversole, a 15-year-old junior, said he was in the classroom when the armed 
youth entered after reportedly firing a shot in the school parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"He never said nothing," Eversole said. "He shot the ceiling and told the 
teacher to leave and let two rows of students leave. . . . He didn't say 
nothing, why he was doing it or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Eversole was released at about 1:30 p.m. after soda was delivered to the room 
-- apparently as part of a deal with police. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the youth released one hostage in exchange for a police radio, 
then others in exchange for cigarettes, pizza and soda. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the boy appeared relatively calm. "He is not ranting, raving, 
this type (of) thing," the trooper said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Robinson said the boy fired one shot at a news helicopter from WCPO-TV 
in Cincinnati shortly before 1 p.m.

CONTROLLER REPORT RAPS TREASURER'S OFFICE, CITES 11 POSSIBLE TAMPERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city controller's report today found "discrepancies" between the accounts of 
Mayor Tom Bradley and Far East National Bank Chairman Henry Hwang regarding a 
pivotal telephone conversation about city deposits with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
In releasing an audit of the city treasurer's office, Controller Rick Tuttle 
also criticized the department for numerous management defects and said he 
found that 11 competitive bid sheets, including one involving Far East, may 
have been altered through illegal tampering. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said "there was a major breakdown in internal control" within the 
treasurer's office March 22 this year, the day following Hwang's telephone call 
to Bradley, who had been paid $18,000 in 1988 as an adviser to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Following Hwang's call to Bradley and the mayor's conversation with Treasurer 
Leonard Rittenberg, the treasurer's office reinstated a $1-million time deposit 
with Far East that had expired and added another $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang told investigators in sworn testimony that he called the mayor to ask his 
help because he had learned that the city was removing a $1-million deposit 
from Far East. He said he had no recollection of discussing other banks or 
broader city policy with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley testified that Hwang had asked him whether it was true that the city 
was withdrawing funds from "all banks." The mayor said he then called 
Rittenberg because of concerns that the city was in "serious desperate 
financial straits." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Rittenberg have both said the mayor did not try to pressure the 
treasurer into making deposits with Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Someone in the treasurer's office later tried to cover up a notation showing 
that the mayor had inquired about Far East. A bid sheet was also altered to 
hide the fact that the $2 million was deposited without competitive bids from 
other banks in violation of office policy. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle's report found that 11 of 53 other time deposits reviewed by his office 
showed use of correction fluid that "may indicate falsification and tampering 
of public records," which is a felony. The other deposits did not involve Far 
East. 
</P>
<P>
The controller said police have custody of the altered documents and are 
investigating whether there were criminal violations. 
</P>
<P>
"Our audit of the treasurer's office has disclosed that the office has major 
weaknesses that has resulted in violations of their system of internal control 
on competitive bidding and review procedures," Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
The treasurer's office has been the subject of at least three major audits or 
investigations in the past six months -- all prompted by the actions of 
Bradley, Rittenberg and his staff in the days following Hwang's March 21 
telephone call to the mayor. Each of the reports has been strongly critical of 
operations within the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
While Bradley was cleared by City Atty. James K. Hahn last week of any criminal 
wrongdoing involving Far East and other business relationships, Hahn criticized 
the mayor for lax ethical standards in his outside dealings. Hahn also filed a 
civil suit against Bradley for failing to publicly disclose, as required by 
law, six of his business investments.

A young man was found shot to death on a North Hollywood street shortly after 
going on a test drive with two men who said they were interested in buying his 
1973 Datzun 240Z sports car, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Davis, 19, was found dead in the 6600 block of Teesdale Avenue about 
9:30 p.m. Sunday. He had been shot repeatedly and was lying in the road a few 
blocks from his home, Detective Mike Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour before the body was discovered, Davis had told his mother and 
sister that he was going to give two men a test drive, Coffey said. The men 
apparently had seen the car advertised in an auto sales magazine, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were seeking the victim's car and the two men. There was no description 
of the men.

Five white defendants pleaded innocent today to charges of murder in the 
killing of a black youth. Four were allowed to remain free on bail, prompting 
an angry outcry from the victim's father. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have kept them in here," Moses Stewart, father of Yusuf Hawkins, 
shouted at Justice Thaddeus Owens at state court in Brooklyn. Owens responded 
by calling for order in the courtroom, which was filled with supporters of 
Hawkins' family. "I do a solo act here," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before, he accepted innocent pleas from the four defendants. The 
alleged triggerman, Joseph Fama, 18, appeared in court later and also entered 
an innocent plea. He was held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, 16, was shot to death on Aug. 23 when he and three friends went to the 
predominantly white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to look at a used car that 
had been advertised for sale.

Israel's defense minister told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today that 
Israel would accept an Egyptian-sponsored dialogue with Palestinians, but the 
two leaders disagreed on the composition of the Arab delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mubarak aired their disagreement publicly 
after meeting in Cairo for more than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Rabin said Israel advocates negotiations only with 
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since 1967. 
At a separate news conference, Mubarak insisted that Palestinians from outside 
the territories be included as well. 
</P>
<P>
But both leaders voiced cautious optimism about the current Israeli-Egyptian 
exchanges on a scenario for overall settlement of the Palestinian problem, 
which has kept the Middle East in turmoil for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
They said their two countries will have further high-level talks.

Lawyers for John A. Zaccaro Jr. asked the Vermont Supreme Court today to throw 
out a cocaine-peddling conviction against the son of unsuccessful 1984 
Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine A. Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys argued Zaccaro's constitutional rights were violated in 1986 
when an undercover Vermont state trooper entered his Middlebury apartment and 
bought $25 worth of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Justices took today's oral arguments under advisement. 
</P>
<P>
Zaccaro, 25, served 90 days under house arrest, performed 530 hours of 
community service and made a $1,500 court-imposed donation to a Burlington 
youth group last year after his April, 1988, conviction on a charge of selling 
a quarter-gram of cocaine to the undercover officer while he was attending 
Middlebury College.

The city editor of the Philadelphia Daily News has resigned after a joke he 
inserted into a news release was mistakenly printed, the newspaper announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Opdyke had slipped the joke into an announcement of scholarships being 
established in memory of the late NBC newswoman Jessica Savitch, who drowned in 
1983 when the car in which she was riding plunged into the Delaware Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Opdyke, 36, had electronically inserted a phrase stating that the scholarships 
in broadcast journalism would also be available to students seeking "college 
instruction in automobile-escape techniques." 
</P>
<P>
In an article in today's Daily News, Editor Zachary Stalberg quoted Opdyke as 
saying he never intended for the phrase to appear in the newspaper. Opdyke said 
he had planned to add a notation saying the phrase was not part of the news 
release, but forgot.

New York lame duck Mayor Edward I. Koch, in a blistering speech to mayors and 
police chiefs, sharply criticized President Bush's anti-drug strategy as 
"morsels from the table," calling the program more of the same failed policy. 
</P>
<P>
"How long can we allow the federal government to reject its responsibility," 
Koch asked. "How long before people rise up in this nation and say government 
is not protecting us?

"I don't think we yet have the will to do everything that needs to be done," he 
added. "And until we get that will at the federal level, we are lost."

<P>
Dean Witter Realty today announced it has acquired Pasadena Financial Center, a 
major downtown office building, for $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-story 147,000-square-foot building, located at 35 North Lake Ave., and 
six-level parking facility for 470 vehicles are situated on about 1.4 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old Pasadena Financial Center is 92% leased. It was purchased for 
Dean Witter Realty's portfolio, possibly as an asset for a future investment 
fund, according to E. Davisson Hardman Jr., a Dean Witter Realty managing 
director. "We expect the slow-growth initiative enacted in March of this year, 
limiting future office development in Pasadena, to increase the value of the 
building," Hardman said.

CoreStates Financial Corp. and First Pennsylvania Corp. today announced a

organization with nearly $23 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the tax-free $18.75-a-share deal, approved this morning by 
First Pennsylvania's board, followed a weekend during which the battle for 
control of First Pennsylvania intensified. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Meridian Bancorp Inc., responding to CoreStates' offer, said it 
intended to increase its earlier $704 million bid to buy First Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
But today CoreStates and First Pennsylvania said in a joint statement that 
their merger was approved after discussion with Meridian.

FEW ADVANCES IN GAS MILEAGE MADE BY '90 MODELS, EPA FINDS 
</P>

<P>
Imported cars dominate both the best and the worst categories in the annual 
survey of automobile gasoline mileage released today by the Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, auto makers made little gain in gasoline mileage in the 1990 model 
year although the number of cars -- mostly expensive super-luxury imports -- 
that trigger the federal "gas guzzler" tax dropped from 40 car types to 30. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no significant difference in the fuel economy of the top 10 1990 
models compared to the top 10 1989 models. Likewise, overall fleet average fuel 
economy of all cars and light trucks . . . projected to be about the same," the 
EPA said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewed Attention 
</P>
<P>
Fuel economy has gained renewed attention in Congress because of concern over 
autos' role in causing global warming and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Auto emissions, especially carbon dioxide releases, are a direct contributor to 
urban smog, which has caused more than 100 metropolitan areas to fail federal 
air quality standards. Carbon dioxide also is a major cause of the so-called 
"greenhouse effect" that scientists say is expected to cause a warming of Earth 
in coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA survey, the mileage leaders were largely foreign-made, 
with the Japanese dominating that end of the list. 
</P>
<P>
For the fifth straight year the fuel-stingiest car was the Japanese-made Geo 
Metro, sold by Chevrolet, followed by the Honda Civic CRX, Suzuki Swift and 
Daihatsu Charade. The Geo Metro XFI model had 53 miles per gallon in the city, 
58 on the highway, and 55 overall, the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
No U.S.-made car made the top 10 list. The Ford Escort had the best mileage of 
any domestic car with 32 miles per gallon in the city, 42 on the highway and 36 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
The car with the worst mileage was the Lamborghini Countach, which got only six 
miles per gallon in the city and 10 on the highway. Rounding out the list of 10 
cars with the worst gas mileage were four models of the Rolls Royce, the 
Ferrari Testarossa, BMW 750IL, Porsche 928 S4, Audi V8 and Maserati 228. 
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA survey, all but two of the 30 car models subject to the 
gas guzzler tax are luxury imports. The exceptions are two Cadillac models, the 
Allante and the larger engine (350 cubic inches) Brougham, which have combined 
city and highway mileage of 18 and 17 miles per gallon, respectively. They had 
the worst gas mileage of any domestic car. 
</P>
<P>
Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year escaped because of 
mileage improvements in 1990 models. These included the Chrysler TC by Maserati 
and the Chrysler New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler 
models that fell under the guzzler tax in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taxed European Models 
</P>
<P>
European models that are subject to the tax come from Maserati, Rolls-Royce, 
Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Volvo, Audi and BMW. 
</P>
<P>
The excise tax amounts to a penalty of $500 to $3,850, with the amount 
increasing as gasoline mileage declines. It was enacted in 1975 to encourage 
people to buy more fuel-efficient cars. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers are required to have an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per 
gallon for their fleets. Last year officials in the Reagan Administration urged 
Congress to eliminate the fleet requirements. But the Bush Administration, 
citing environmental concerns, has urged auto makers to continue pursuing 
increases in the fleet averages and efforts to rescind the standards have 
fallen by the wayside.

A judge today fined the United Mine Workers $13.5 million -- nearly double the 
amount of his previous penalties -- for a litany of violations during its 
strike against the Pittston Coal Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The UMW now has been fined $22 million by state and federal judges for 
violations of injunctions limiting strike activity during the 5 1/2-month-old 
walkout. 
</P>
<P>
In two previous hearings, Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin fined 
the union $3 million and $4.5 million. U.S. District Judge Glen Williams has 
fined the union about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
McGlothlin imposed the new fine today after hearing testimony last week on 60 
charges alleged by Pittston. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fines for specific incidents of violent and nonviolent 
violations of strike restrictions he issued in July and August, the judge 
imposed a general penalty of $1 million against the union for failing to 
control violence.

Vlade Divac, Yugoslavia's star center, was granted a one-year deferment of his 
military service today, clearing the way for him to play for the Los Angeles 
Lakers in the NBA, the state Tanjug news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Divac, who signed with the Lakers last month and is at the club's training 
camp, was originally scheduled to start his compulsory military service on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Yugoslav team sources told the Associated Press that Divac 
had been granted a three-year deferment. The state-run Vecernje Novosti 
newspaper carried a similar report at that time, quoting unofficial sources. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug suggested today that Divac could get another year's deferment next year.

The future of Nashwan, one of Europe's top racehorses, was in serious doubt 
today, 24 hours after the thoroughbred was beaten for the first time in his 
six-race career in a warm-up for the prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. 
</P>
<P>
Nashwan, winner of the Epsom Derby, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes 
and 2,000 Guineas, put on a lifeless performance and finished third in Sunday's 
Prix Niel at Longchamp outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Tests are to be carried out on the colt, recently put up for syndication at 
$28.8 million, and a decision is expected later this week whether Nashwan will 
retire or race in the Arc on Oct. 8. The horse's owners originally wanted 
Nashwan to bow out in a blaze of glory at the Arc before beginning stud duties.

San Diego Padres third baseman Bip Roberts, complaining of chest pains when he 
was carried from the dugout in San Francisco last week, has been cleared to 
play after doctors determined the problem was a muscle tear and 
gastroenteritis, team officials said. 
</P>

Roberts was scheduled to rejoin the team in Cincinnati today and could be in 
the starting lineup Tuesday when the Padres and Reds open a three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, 25, was carried out of the Padres' dugout on a stretcher in 
Candlestick Park Friday night, complaining of chest pains. He spent the night 
in the cardiac-care unit of San Francisco General Hospital and returned to San 
Diego Saturday, where he underwent a battery of tests at Scripps Clinic in La 
Jolla. Doctors concluded that the chest pains were caused by a combination of a 
muscle tear in the rib cage and gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach 
lining.
