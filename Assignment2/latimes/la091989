'LIVING UNIT' MAY MEAN HOUSING HOPE FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego would become the nation's first home for a new form of low-income 
housing under a plan approved Monday by the City Council to build three 
demonstration "living unit" projects downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Generally bigger than single-room-occupancy hotel rooms but smaller than studio 
apartments, "living units" combine elements of both dwellings in an effort to 
provide a solution to the city's critical shortage of low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Two people would reside in each living unit. Their combined rent, set by the 
city, would be $431 or $496 a month, depending on the amount of parking 
provided at the project. Council approval of the project Monday marked the 
first time the city has established a rent-controlled dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finding Home Of Their Own 
</P>
<P>
The living units "will allow two people who are, say, living in a shelter, to 
be able to find a place to live," said Joan Dowd, a member of a panel composed 
of the leaders of the city's community planning groups. "They can go and find a 
home that is their own." 
</P>
<P>
Devised by the city's Planning Department to complement a program that 
encourages construction of single-room-occupancy hotels, the living unit 
concept required state legislation, signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian 
on Jan. 1, 1988, that defined such a dwelling unit under state building codes. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the day before the election to fill four council seats, the council 
considered delaying the project over concerns about allowing construction in 
residential areas. Instead, it settled on construction of three demonstration 
projects, all of which must be in the downtown Center City planning area. 
</P>
<P>
No developer has proposed construction of a living unit building, according to 
Senior Planner Judith Lenthall, architect of the concept. But Lenthall added 
that availability of "tens of millions of dollars" in state subsidies beginning 
Jan. 1 could spur construction of the dwellings. The money was included in 
ballot propositions approved by voters last year, Lenthall said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, like most major American cities, suffers from an acute shortage of 
affordable housing for the poor, primarily because of billions of dollars cut 
from federal housing programs in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Planning Department, the city would have to produce 4,500 
low-income housing units per year to accommodate recent increases in the number 
of poor in the city. In the last three years, developers have built 258 such 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Living units are aimed at getting the poor off the street or out of shelters. 
They would allow two minimum-wage earners to pool resources to share the 
dwellings, which must have at least 150 square feet. In a building composed of 
living units, the average size of all the units can be no more than 270 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike SROs, where rooms can be as small as 70 square feet and kitchen and 
bathroom facilities are generally communal, each living unit must contain a 
kitchen sink, a toilet, a counter top, a closet and electrical outlets for a 
refrigerator and a microwave oven. Laundry facilities and communal bathrooms 
are required in buildings where units do not included complete bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited to Certain Areas 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, under state law studio apartments must be at least 220 square 
feet and include complete kitchen and bathroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Planning Department proposal, living units would be allowed in areas 
zoned for hotels and motels and in high-density multifamily zones near major 
hospitals, colleges, large military installations or major transportation 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to evaluate three demonstration projects before allowing further 
construction came when council members Gloria McColl, Ed Struiksma and Bruce 
Henderson said they had too little knowledge of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
However, even the demonstration projects will have to wait until a developer 
demonstrates interest in the plans. 
</P>
<P>
No living units would be permitted in Barrio Logan, Golden Hill, San Ysidro or 
Southeast San Diego, which already have disproportionate shares of the city's 
low-income housing.

REACTION TO PENDLETON PRESERVATION PLAN MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attempt by a volunteer urban-planning and environmental group to protect 
Camp Pendleton from private development, both for the sake of wildlife there 
and so the land will continue to serve as a buffer to Orange County's urban 
sprawl, has won at least one supporter in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has said he will introduce legislation to preserve 
the area as open space by requiring that, "if and when the United States Marine 
Corps ever vacates" any or all of the 125,000-acre base, the land will remain 
under federal control and be dedicated as a national park or wildlife preserve 
for several endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal was met with apprehension from the Marine Corps and was 
downright criticized by another member of San Diego's delegation in Washington 
who believes it would be counterproductive to the goal of keeping the base 
under federal ownership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hates the Mere Suggestion 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes the sprawling base, said 
through a spokesman that he opposes Bates' bill because of its mere suggestion 
that Camp Pendleton might one day be abandoned by the military. 
</P>
<P>
Packard "doesn't feel there's any need for this kind of legislation," said 
David Coggin, his chief of staff. "He has long said that Camp Pendleton will be 
a Marine base well into his great-grandchildren's lifetime. If we start doing 
bills like this, it gives people the notion that maybe it should be closed. It 
would establish a fait accompli to developers or others who want to put an 
airport there. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressman is very adamant that he would not introduce, and would not 
support, legislation in this regard, because it's totally unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
Bates' reply is: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand his logic at all. The bill makes it clear that the base 
would not be developed with residential, commercial or industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate anything ever happening to Camp Pendleton, and I don't 
think this bill is a signal that we're pushing them out. But, given the 
changing military needs in our country, if, in the distant future there should 
be a change, we want to be ready for it. This bill simply lays the groundwork 
to ensure that this land remains in public hands, for use as a park and for 
wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continuous Swath 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is sought by the San Diego group Citizens Coordinate for 
Century 3, or C3, which fears that the forces of rampant growth are so great in 
Southern California that, in time, corridors between San Diego County and the 
counties of Riverside and Orange will be a continuous swath of housing tracts 
and commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
The group maintains that Camp Pendleton serves as both a physical and 
psychological barrier in preventing the so-called Los Angelization of San Diego 
and a worst-case scenario that all of Southern California may one day be 
integrated as a suburb of that city. 
</P>
<P>
Don Wood, president of C3, said last week that he is delighted by Bates' 
proposed legislation and confused by Packard's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are already piecemeal attempts by developers and others to pull out 
pieces of the base -- for oil drilling, for toll roads, for airports," Wood 
said. "The base has an entire office dedicated to encroachment problems like 
these. 
</P>
<P>
"If this bill passes, then anytime the Marines declare any portion of the base 
as surplus, it would not be available for developers to rip off for private, 
commercial development," he said. "Passage of the bill would decrease the 
number of attempts to encroach there. It strengthens, not weakens, the Marine 
position because it takes away the incentive for private interests to try to 
rip the base off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Like the Marines' 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make it very clear that we like the Marines being there," Wood 
said. "They have the current ability to keep developers off their land because 
they have guns. But what if the Marines ever do leave?" 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he hopes Packard "will turn around when he sees the value this bill 
would have to the Marines, whom he purports to support." 
</P>
<P>
Today, San Diego County Supervisor John MacDonald, whose North County district 
includes Camp Pendleton, will ask other board members to adopt a generic 
resolution echoing Bates' position on the base's future. 
</P>
<P>
Bates himself has not decided when he will introduce the bill; in the meantime, 
he is circulating drafts of it to environmental groups for reaction. 
</P>
<P>
He said some environmentalists have told him that it is not worded strongly 
enough and that it should stipulate that Camp Pendleton automatically become 
national parkland or a wildlife preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said he backed down from the stronger wording in favor of first calling 
for a review by the Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congress Has Final Say 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would require the Secretary of the Interior to make a 
recommendation to Congress that "will provide for the maximum preservation of 
the Camp Pendleton property" under the management of Interior, Bates said. 
Congress would make the ultimate decree under terms of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the bill has a better chance of passage with that review process 
included in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-San Diego), according to his staff, will not 
introduce his own legislation in the Senate, but is willing to support Bates' 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Wilson's position is that the base is not going to ever be closed, 
period. It's a vital key to our national military interests and to the local 
community," said Wilson spokeswoman Lynda Schuler. "No one has ever talked 
seriously of closing it, and we see no reason why it would change, unless we 
establish world peace tomorrow. It's a critical base, and it will be there as 
long as we need the U. S. Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't object to the proposal (by Bates), but we have no plans to follow 
suit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, of C3, said he is confused by Packard's position because "we were told 
earlier by his staff that they could see their way to support the bill if the 
Marines did, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Busy Place 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Marine Corps said Bates' proposal "is a well-intentioned and 
appreciated effort to preserve valuable environmental resources." 
</P>
<P>
But Camp Pendleton spokesman Lt. Col. John Shotwell noted that the base is the 
busiest training facility of any Defense Department installation. "We don't 
envision a time when Camp Pendleton, with its unique and ideal features for 
amphibious and other types of military training, would not be vital to our 
nation's defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Further, we think it speculative at best to legislate a destiny for the 
property during some future unknown era when some other use may be in the 
public's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also apprehensive," Shotwell said, "that such legislation could 
potentially hamper our current use and activities at Camp Pendleton. We are 
concerned there may be activities under way here, or facilities planned for 
construction, that could themselves be challenged as being incompatible with 
what a national park should have. We're also concerned that there may be 
additional layers of bureaucracy placed on us, as far as our own future plans, 
growth and development, in order to get our own projects approved." 
</P>
<P>
He noted, too, that a 1972 federal law already gives Congress control over the 
disposition of the base. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton, which stretches along 17 miles of oceanfront and backs up 10 
miles inland to the Cleveland National Forest and the Santa Margarita 
Mountains, is the only Marine base in the country where the military can 
simultaneously practice amphibious assaults, troop maneuvers and aircraft 
bombing runs with live ordnance. 
</P>
<P>
The base also serves as a host to a herd of 50 bison and such endangered birds 
as the California least tern, the light-footed clapper rail, Belding's savannah 
sparrow, California brown pelican and the least Bell's vireo.

3 ABORTION FOES SURRENDER TO DO JAIL TIME BY CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three anti-abortionists, convicted of trespassing during a July protest at a 
San Marcos medical clinic, surrendered Monday in Vista Municipal Court to begin 
jail terms, saying they preferred jail to the probation terms that would have 
let them remain free. 
</P>
<P>
The three, who were sentenced Friday by Vista Municipal Judge Harley Earwicker, 
arrived at his courtroom promptly at 9 a.m. Monday, accompanied by about 10 
supporters who sang the hymn "Amazing Grace." The three were handcuffed and led 
away by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"Probation would have been the easier way for them to go," said attorney Burton 
Shamsky, who represented one of the three jailed defendants. "But they opted 
for jail time because they didn't want any part of the restrictions that went 
along with probation." 
</P>
<P>
Earwicker had offered four defendants in the same case a suspended sentence and 
probation instead of jail. But the terms of the two-year probation included a 
promise on their part that they would not picket any closer than 100 feet at 
the office of Dr. George Kung in San Marcos, that they commit no similar crimes 
-- including trespassing, and that they pay fines and do community service. 
</P>
<P>
One of the four, Nancy Scofield, 40, of Poway, agreed to the terms and was 
released on probation Friday. But the other three defendants -- Dean Mesa, 30, 
of San Diego, a former deputy sheriff who was also convicted of resisting 
arrest; Georgina Cheek, 37, of Santee, and Angela Phelps, 31, of El Cajon -- on 
Friday rejected Earwicker's offer. Cheek and Phelps face 60-day jail terms and 
Mesa was sentenced to 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered them immediately handcuffed and readied for jail, but then 
agreed to let them remain free over the weekend so they could set their 
personal lives in order, on the promise they would return to his courtroom 
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
All four were convicted Friday by the same jury of trespassing during the July 
incident that attracted about 15 anti-abortionists to Kung's office on South 
Rancho Santa Fe Road. All of the protesters left the office but the four, who 
locked themselves together at their necks with U-shaped bicycle locks. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa, who had been arrested at other abortion protests in San Diego County, was 
also arrested for delaying and obstructing justice after he lifted his feet off 
the ground as he was being led out of the office. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Romo, who prosecuted the case, said he had never 
before heard of a misdemeanor case in which the defendants accepted jail time 
over probation. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge took great pains to explain to them that the terms of probation 
didn't mean they couldn't picket or protest, but just that they had to stay 100 
feet from that particular doctor's office," Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the three preferred jail time. Romo said they would likely spend only 
two-thirds of their time in jail -- based on expected good behavior -- and 
could conceivably be released by the Sheriff's Department earlier, depending on 
jail crowding. Both women were sent to the County Jail at Las Colinas. 
</P>
<P>
Because they are serving time, they will face no restrictions on picketing 
after their release -- as would have otherwise been the case had they accepted 
two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa and Cheek represented themselves in court. Shamsky, who represented 
Scofield and Phelps, said he concurred with the decision by the three to go to 
jail rather than submit to the terms of probation.

<P>
Just five months ago, an 800-pound pig named Grunt was in a ton of trouble 
because his owners had moved away from Rolling Hills Estates and left him 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
County officials feared he might have to be put to death because it seemed 
unlikely that anyone would be willing to adopt a hunk of pork that size. But 
once his plight became known, the county received more than 400 offers in less 
than a week. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless swine not only found a new life on a Santa Paula ranch in Ventura 
County, but a female recently moved in with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Her name's Pugsy," said Rhonda Osborn, whose husband Ozzie adopted Grunt. "She 
doesn't have a nose hardly. She's really cute, and even lazier than he is. She 
kept going up to Grunt's pen and hanging out. So we finally put her in there." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Grunt admired her slim figure. Pugsy weighs just 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
However, their relationship is a bit more complicated than the surface serenity 
on the 193-acre ranch would suggest. (Isn't that always the case?) 
</P>
<P>
Pugsy is pregnant -- but not by Grunt. 
</P>
<P>
She was in a family way when she found Grunt. He doesn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a great time," said Osborn. "They just sleep all day." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, many DeLorean drivers fear that there's only so much life in their 
8-year-old jalopy, and give it even less exercise than Grunt gets. 
</P>
<P>
DeLorean World Magazine, published in Sun Valley, recently reminded owners 
that, in order to avoid fuel system problems, they should remember to run the 
engine for at least 10 minutes "each month." 
</P>
<P>
It was a proud weekend for Allan Abbott and Alec Brooks of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The craft that they built set a world speed record on water in Adrian, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it went almost 19 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly approaching the speed of sound, true, but then their Flying Fish 
hydrofoil was human-powered. 
</P>
<P>
Pedaling like a bicyclist, pilot Bobby Livingston of Atlanta zoomed across the 
100-meter course on Lake Adrian at an average speed of 18.76 m.p.h., or 16.23 
knots, to win the 15th annual International Human Powered Speed Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, he didn't quite pedal fast enough to win the $25,000 prize offered by 
DuPont Co. for the first single-rider water craft to top an average speed of 23 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
But he did move faster than the average rush-hour commuter on the Pasadena 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Corralling canine entertainment stars for a fund-raising benefit for less 
fortunate four-legged critters isn't so easy. 
</P>
<P>
Or so publicist Howard Bragman discovered when he tried to line up some celeb 
pooches for an Amanda Foundation fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion Oct. 14. 
The foundation rescues stray dogs and cats from city shelters and places them 
in homes. 
</P>
<P>
Bragman heard a lot of Hollywood-type excuses from such can't-shows as Lassie 
("they said she was off on a promotional tour for the new television series"), 
Rin Tin Tin ("in Canada on a publicity tour") and Spuds McKenzie ("his PR man 
explained he's had too much exposure in L.A. lately"). 
</P>
<P>
However, Bragman was able to land Beasley, who gave the sensitive portrayal of 
the slobbering Hooch in "Turner and Hooch," Mike (from "Down and Out in Beverly 
Hills") and Dreyfuss (from television's "Empty Nest"). 
</P>
<P>
Dreyfuss the dog, incidentally, is not to be confused with Richard Dreyfuss the 
human who co-starred with Mike the dog in "Down and Out in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
A bit more than 103 years ago, The Times published 70 answers to questions 
about Los Angeles "oftenest put by prospective comers." 
</P>
<P>
Here's answer No. 40: 
</P>
<P>
"The inhabitants do not wear arsenals, nor shoot at the drop of a handkerchief. 
The Apaches are 800 miles away. . . . "

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREE CONSERVATION PROGRAM APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Lite Bill," a free, yearlong program to reduce energy and water use in 
Pasadena's 37,000 households will be undertaken by DMC Services Inc. of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The company was awarded a contract with the city last week by the Board of 
Directors, despite objections from Directors Chris Holden and Rick Cole. The 
two questioned why a minority-owned firm, Foothill Area Community Services, was 
not selected. 
</P>
<P>
After discussion, the board agreed that FACS could participate as a DMC 
subcontractor if more than the anticipated 20% of the city's residential 
households respond and the program is extended. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Lite Bill program, door-to-door canvassers will be assigned to all 
residential dwellings of four units or less to analyze home-energy use and 
distribute energy-saving devices such as low-flow shower heads and water-heater 
insulation blankets. 
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to save customers $3.5 million over the next five 
years. It will cost $952,000, including $373,000 provided by the Metropolitan 
Water District.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least two people were killed Monday when a single-engine plane crashed into 
a rugged hillside north of Escondido, the Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why it crashed," Deputy James Payton said of the 11:10 a.m. 
accident, adding, "We don't know where it was headed to. We don't know how many 
people actually were on board." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Youkel, an area resident, told television reporters that it "looked like 
(the pilot) was trying to do acrobatics, or something, and then the plane went 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, California Highway Patrol officers and Deer Springs 
firefighters searched the hilly terrain near the crash site, east of Interstate 
15 near the Deer Springs Road off-ramp, Deputy Lorraine Truitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Wreckage was scattered over a large area, Truitt added. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether the two bodies were male or female, Payton said.

The Times provided its readership with an apt illustration of why we're losing 
the war on drugs when, on the day after the President's drug policy speech, it 
featured on its Op-Ed Page two "just say yes to drugs" items: the article by 
Prof. Nadelmann advocating legalization of drugs and the Morin cartoon excusing 
drug dealing in the ghetto because of allegedly "no jobs, no opportunity, no 
education."

HATCH COMMENTS ON IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am concerned and disturbed by the statement quoted in a Times' article 
"Heavily Asian Town's Mayor Holds Tight to Controversial Views," by Berkley 
Hudson, (Metro, July, 16) on Barry L. Hatch, outgoing mayor (and current city 
councilman) of Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted in the article stated that "new Asian immigrants have told 
him, 'We don't care about your culture, your traditions and your history. We're 
here to make money.' " Hatch has not only denounced the new Asian immigrants, 
but entire ethnic people groups. 
</P>
<P>
If this statement was allegedly made, it certainly does not reflect the 
attitude of the entire new Asian immigrants or the Asian population. Those 
sweeping generalizations made by Hatch attach derogatory connotations to a 
particular group. The contents of the article touches upon a grave matter for 
the Asian people in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the present, many Asian people continue to daily confront racial stereotypes 
and expectations that society has perpetuated. Many erroneous judgments and 
opinions originate from a single experience which does not give a true 
representation of the whole. It is an unfair and a wrongful assumption to 
single out and blame particular people groups on the present ills of society 
such as the "overburdened streets, schools, jails and hospitals of Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
The culture and language barrier have alienated many people on both sides of 
the conflict. There are many Asian and Asian Americans who have successfully 
maintained their cultural identity and assimilated into American society, but 
this is masked by the visible group who is ignorant on how to or, 
unfortunately, choose not to. The vast majority of Americans have descended 
from or are immigrants from foreign countries, yet why is there a present 
outcry against those who come to the United States to seek a better life? 
</P>
<P>
A constructive alternative to finger-pointing and increased animosity is an 
educational program to assist those new immigrants and others in assimilating 
into the American culture and society. This problem needs to be recognized and 
addressed. We can start by practicing the virtue of brotherly love and mutual 
help.

FIGHTING THE WAR ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have read with close attention everything your paper has published in the 
past days about the drug problem, particularly what has to do with my country, 
Colombia, and with my hometown, Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
Your article (Part I, Sept. 9) analyzing the impossibility of controlling drugs 
at its source has confirmed my point of view, and that of many Colombians also, 
that, no matter how much our government tries, no matter how many lives we 
sacrifice, or how much money you send us in planes and arms to fight the drug 
cartels, there will be no end to this struggle, at least, not until the demand 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
Will it ever end? This is the big question the world is now asking. The 
complexity of the problem is undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
At some time in the future the world will realize that by outlawing cocaine we 
have created an evil greater than the drug, and it is the corruption and 
immorality which have no respect for human life. Colombia is a clear example of 
this. We are not fighting drug addiction so much as corruption by drug 
traffickers at levels never before seen in our country. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that we don't have problems of drug addiction in our country or that 
we are insensitive to the dimension of the problem in the United States and in 
other countries of the world. It is just that no other country's legal system 
and survival as a civilized nation have been threatened as has been the case of 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Wars are senseless, but people seem to get into them without realizing how 
senseless they can be and always thinking that it will be only for a few 
months. But this is a different situation. Even President Bush speaks of years, 
and deep down everybody knows that as long as people want to use cocaine, there 
will never be an end to this. 
</P>
<P>
So, if we will end up accepting that people will get cocaine somehow, let us 
accept it now before my country is torn apart. Let us all dedicate our efforts 
to what peace can offer: the opportunity to prevent its use by giving a better 
life to those who are more susceptible to become addicts and help to those who 
already are.

SWEET MUSIC TO LONG BEACH EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just four years ago, the future of the Long Beach Symphony was exceedingly 
bleak. The orchestra had gone so deeply in debt that it had to cancel an entire 
season. There was general unhappiness with its part-time conductor and music 
director. Some questioned whether the orchestra had any future. 
</P>
<P>
But determined community leaders and symphony General Manager Mary Newkirk 
refused to give up. They embarked on a fund-raising drive that was so 
successful that the orchestra was able to come back the next year with an 
abridged season. They dumped the veteran, but part-time music director and held 
a season-long series of auditions for a successor who would pledge atleast 100 
days a year to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The new Long Beach Symphony opened its 55th season to a packed hall last 
Saturday night, with 90% of the year's seats sold in advance through 
subscription. The orchestra played under the baton of an exciting new conductor 
and music director, JoAnn Falletta, 35, formerly associate conductor of the 
Milwaukee Symphony and leader of several smaller ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
Already a big draw at the box office, Falletta was also a hit on the podium. 
Long Beach not only has resurrected its symphony, it has hitched it to one of 
the brightest stars of symphonic music in America, a dazzling way to conduct a 
comeback.

GOOD WORK IN SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was that some magic potion infecting Sacramento last week? If so, it could be 
bottled and sold for a fortune. The mood was one of conciliation and compromise 
right down to the end of the 1989 California Legislature. Intractable issues of 
the sort that had put Democratic legislative leaders and Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian at bitter odds for years suddenly got resolved. After too many 
sessions in which it seemed that California's leaders were more interested in 
their own political stock than the future of the state, the current Legislature 
produced a remarkable record of achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Recent legislative closings too often were marked by exchanges of recrimination 
over who was to blame for the defeat of important legislation. Wrap-up 
summaries focused on unmet needs and legislators succumbing to the fear of 
political retribution. But when the final gavel fell along about 4 a.m. this 
past Saturday, observers marveled at the number of eleventh-hour compromises 
that had salvaged important legislation. Democrats and Republicans found 
themselves commending each other -- and seeming to mean it. 
</P>
<P>
Not all was perfect, of course. About $150 million in budget items remain 
unresolved. Important reforms in the fields of health insurance and workers' 
compensation had to be scaled back to limited measures. There is plenty of work 
left for the second half of the session beginning next January, with 
election-year politics threatening to undermine 1989's mood of constructive 
amiability. 
</P>
<P>
Also, two major packages approved this year cannot be implemented unless they 
get voter approval at the June primary election. Democrats and Republicans will 
have to work together if there is any chance of selling voters on the vitally 
needed $18.5 billion state transportation program and reform of the Gann 
spending limits. The same is true for a legislative ethics package that offers 
the prospect of a pay raise in exchange for the loss of Sacramento frills, such 
as speaking honorarium, that tend to to tie lawmakers too closely to big-money 
lobbying groups. 
</P>
<P>
But the list of achievements still is impressive, including a major new state 
solid-waste management and recycling program, a limited ban on assault rifles 
and a landmark agreement on preserving Mono Lake against water diversions to 
Los Angeles. Some other significant victories overlooked in the rush toward 
adjournment include Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan's (D-Fresno) Food Safety Act of 
1989 that would provide Californians further protection against pesticides and 
Sen. John Garamendi's (D-Walnut Grove) legislation to re-establish California's 
10% solar energy tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
All this productivity is not entirely the result of a passion for good public 
policy. Both the Legislature and governor had been sharply criticized for 
failing to deal with problems that were eroding the quality of California life. 
Legislative leaders battled for the survival of their image and their power 
positions. The governor, who is not seeking a third term, involved himself as 
never before to rescue his legacy from threatened mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
There is no assurance that this level of bipartisan cooperation can be 
sustained. It will take an active governor and an independent Legislature 
willing to buck special-interest groups and campaign contributors in the 
interests of the good of the whole state. The completion of a strong 
legislative ethics program and campaign finance reform will help give the 
lawmakers that sort of courage. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the governor and lawmakers deserve to take more than a few 
bows for achieving perhaps the most productive legislative record in recent 
California history.

FIGHTING THE WAR ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times should be lauded for publishing an unpopular alternative drug plan 
("Anyone Care What Works?" by Ethan Nadelmann, Op-Ed Page, Sept. 6). The 
trouble with Nadelmann's plan is that it does not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Heretofore, it may be true that government has respected free enterprise and 
just taxed and regulated "sins." But drugs are such a big "sin" that government 
will have to get directly involved. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to kill this "blue chip" $110-billion business is to have the U.S. 
government take it over. Set up government drug stores, register users and sell 
drugs at a fair market price which will drive illegal dealers out of business. 
And if it doesn't, cite them as we now do bootleggers and bookies. Define drug 
abuse and addiction as social-mental diseases requiring treatment and 
hospitalization. Circulate lists of users to employers, schools, military 
services, government agencies, etc. Inform parents of use by minors, and 
require that parents try to stop drug abuse in the home. 
</P>
<P>
With the profits that even government would somehow manage to make, for the 
first few years at least, we could treat addicts, and build and fund special 
hospitals and halfway houses. We would free penitentiary cells, court calendars 
could be cleared and the police and military could go back to chasing muggers. 
And maybe the gangs would go back to spraying graffiti and just shooting one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
For the "less fortunate" who cannot afford drugs, we could give drug stamps and 
clean needles. Perhaps then our persons, homes and cars would be safer. 
</P>
<P>
Am I serious? As serious as were Voltaire, Mark Twain and Will Rogers.

MAN, 19, SHOT TO DEATH AFTER TAKING PAIR ON TEST-DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood man was found shot to death on a street near his home half an 
hour after he took two men on a test-drive in a $2,000 sports car he was 
selling, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Richard Ronald Davis, 19, was discovered about 9:30 p.m. Sunday 
near a curb in the 6600 block of Teesdale Avenue by a resident of the street 
returning home, Detective Mike Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had been shot several times and had crawled along the street, in an 
apparent effort to reach help, before dying. Coffey said neighbors on the 
street had heard several popping sounds but had been unaware that they were 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said investigators are unsure of a motive for the slaying. Davis' 1973 
Datsun 240Z, which he had been trying to sell, was stolen but it was not 
believed that Davis had much money with him when he took two strangers for a 
ride in the car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard to figure," Coffey said. "The only object of a robbery seems 
to have been the car. But how much could the car be worth? It would have been a 
lot simpler to rip one off the street with no one in it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a moving company employee who had bought the Datsun Sept. 5, according 
to state vehicle records, lived with his mother and sister on Welby Way about 
two blocks from where his body was found. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' mother told investigators that her son had advertised the car for sale 
for $2,000 in a regional auto sales magazine, Coffey said. Earlier Sunday, 
Davis had received a call from a man police believe may have been one of the 
gunmen, and the appointment for the test-drive was set for later that evening. 
</P>
<P>
About 9 p.m., two men came to his door and Davis told his mother that he would 
be back after taking them on a test-drive. His mother and sister did not see 
the men, and police have no description of them, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen sports car was described as red with a slight dent in the rear, 
revealing yellow paint beneath. The license tag is 240 HSC, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caution Advised 
</P>
<P>
Police advised those with cars for sale to take precautions when dealing with 
strangers who ask to test-drive the vehicle. Police said sellers should not 
allow themselves to be outnumbered inside the car, or to go on a test-drive 
without alerting a family member or an acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
"Never go into these things alone," said Officer Bill Frio, a department 
spokesman. "Get your neighbor and ask him to stand by for a minute. Let people 
know what you are doing, who you are doing it with and where you are going." 
</P>
<P>
Frio said sellers should choose their own test route and drive it themselves to 
see how long it takes, then alert a family member or neighbor to call police if 
they do not return in the expected length of time. 
</P>
<P>
Frio said sellers should write down license plate numbers of the cars that 
buyers arrive in. If two people come for a test-drive, take them out one at a 
time. "Split them up and make it difficult for them to keep their anonymity," 
he said.

A TREE GOES TO BROOKLYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A refrigerated 18-wheel truck set off Monday from the Antelope Valley for 
Brooklyn, N.Y., carrying precious cargo: a 10-foot-tall, 2,000-pound Joshua 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
The horticultural odyssey combines the efforts of a retired Palmdale forester 
turned crusading protector of Joshua trees, a Malibu landscaper and officials 
at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, a 50-acre oasis of greenery in a tough urban 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Edmond Moulin, director of horticulture at the garden, had been pining for a 
Joshua tree to complete a new exhibit of desert vegetation from around the 
world. But he thought the trees had protected status in California and were 
hard to get. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Joshua trees are protected on some state land but not on private 
property, as Malibu landscaper Betty Jo McDonald told Moulin when she visited 
the New York exhibit earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him they chop them down and take them to the dump every day," McDonald 
said. "I told him I could get him a Joshua tree." 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Pavilion is one of three enclosed, climate-controlled exhibits that 
are centerpieces of the Botanic Garden. The other two are the Tropical 
Pavilion, devoted to tropical plants, and the Temperate Pavilion, displaying 
flora from the Mediterranean and Near East. 
</P>
<P>
Moulin said the newly refurbished Desert Pavilion contains a range of plants, 
sand and stone representing desert environments of different continents. The 
Joshua tree will be a dominant feature of the "New World" section of the desert 
display, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The sturdy trees, which look like gnarled, spiny claws on squat trunks, grow in 
the Mojave Desert and require minimal water. They have become the object of a 
crusade for nature lovers in the Antelope Valley because thousands have been 
chopped down to make way for a wave of development in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists such as Tony Baal of Palmdale, who supplied the tree for the 
Brooklyn Botanic Garden, see Joshua trees as a symbol of high desert heritage 
threatened by the building boom. 
</P>
<P>
Baal uses a mechanical tree spade to uproot Joshua trees, which he sells and 
transplants. He said he has sent Joshua trees to other states, but never as far 
as New York. 
</P>
<P>
"What a production," Baal said Monday at his Christmas tree farm as a large 
crane slowly hoisted the boxed tree into a produce truck, where it will ride at 
a controlled temperature of 70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Baal and McDonald also threw in a smaller Joshua tree and five cholla cacti, 
desert plants missing from the Brooklyn display. The trees were obtained from 
county-owned land near the site of the Palmdale Regional Airport, where Baal 
has a contract to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
Baal, a retired county forester, worked as a city consultant on Joshua trees 
for several years. He quit in frustration with what he called government 
officials' lack of energy in protecting them and started his own consulting 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe what they're doing to the desert environment," Baal said. He 
hopes the interest expressed by faraway plant specialists will spur new local 
interest in preserving desert vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton Collier, the Dallas trucker entrusted with transporting the desert 
specimens, made sure the plants were secure in a small part of a cavernous 
cargo area that usually carries avocados or other produce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paying Good Money 
</P>
<P>
"They're sure paying good money for a light load," he drawled. 
</P>
<P>
The Botanic Garden, which is run jointly by the city of New York and a private 
nonprofit corporation, will pay almost $6,000 for packing and shipping of the 
tree. The expense is well worth it, Moulin said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tree that should be protected," he said. "It was something we wanted 
and we are happy to have. It will be transplanted. This is not a temporary 
educational display." 
</P>
<P>
Baal said he has full confidence that the tree will thrive in its new home. And 
he plans to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I've going to Pennsylvania next year for a high school reunion," he said. "And 
then I'm going to go check on my tree."

DEUKMEJIAN BACKS WRIGHT FOR REELECTION TO ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Monday endorsed embattled Assemblywoman Cathie Wright 
(R-Simi Valley) as she prepared for a primary election campaign against fellow 
Republican Hunt Braly, who has said he will question her ethics and loyalty to 
the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
"Cathie Wright ought to be reelected. She has been a very staunch supporter of 
ours and very helpful and cooperative, and she does an effective job for her 
district," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian made his comments outside a $100-a-head fund-raising dinner at a 
Simi Valley hotel attended by more than 300 cheering Wright supporters. Wright 
said she expected to raise $40,000 to $50,000 from the event. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's endorsement came as Wright braced for what could be a strong 
challenge in the June, 1990, GOP primary election from Braly, chief of staff to 
state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). Braly, who is expected to have Davis' 
endorsement, said he has raised $65,000 for the race since late May. 
</P>
<P>
Braly announced that he was seeking Wright's seat in May after Wright became 
mired in allegations that she used her political clout in an effort to persuade 
authorities to go easier on her and her 24-year-old daughter after they 
received traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10-Week Probe 
</P>
<P>
After a 10-week probe, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury concluded 
that Wright "demonstrated a clear pattern" of attempts to get preferential 
treatment for herself and her daughter. However, he said the assemblywoman 
committed "no clear-cut criminal violations" that would warrant prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Among other allegations, Bradbury's 97-page report cited several instances in 
which Wright was said to have tried to get police to void tickets issued to her 
or her daughter, Victoria. It also said Wright discussed two of Victoria's 
speeding citations with a judge at his home the day before he dismissed both 
tickets in exchange for Victoria attending traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ticket-fixing investigation, Cathie Wright absorbed a 
significant amount of political flak in December, 1988, when she refused to 
oppose Assemblyman Willie Brown's (D-San Francisco) reelection as Speaker, 
antagonizing many fellow GOP lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Most members of the Assembly Republican caucus lined up behind Assemblyman 
Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), one of five dissident Democrats who 
repeatedly voted against Brown. Wright, however, abstained -- the only Assembly 
member to do so in the tight speakership vote. 
</P>
<P>
Wright explained that she promised constituents she would never vote for a 
Democratic Speaker, but her abstention sparked a failed attempt by angry 
Republicans to remove her from the powerful Assembly Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
It was later revealed that Brown provided Wright with the name of a lawyer to 
help with her daughter's ticket problems. The Speaker also telephoned a Ventura 
County judge about the younger Wright in March, 1988, urging him to be lenient 
with her for driving without a license. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Huge Boost' 
</P>
<P>
One GOP lawmaker, who asked not to be identified, said Monday that the 
governor's endorsement constituted a "huge boost" for Wright in her battle 
against Braly, who has promised to question her links to Brown and her ethics 
during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Deukmejian is the party's leader and that his "personal ethics have 
never been questioned," the legislator said the governor's blessing "reduces 
the two key vulnerabilities Wright has among Republicans -- that she's not a 
loyal Republican and that she's unethical." 
</P>
<P>
But Braly attempted to minimize the significance of the gubernatorial 
endorsement, saying that Deukmejian routinely makes campaign appearances on 
behalf of GOP incumbents. He added that he does not think endorsements have 
much effect on how voters cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Wright denied that the governor's appearance was an effort to offset possible 
political damage resulting from Bradbury's allegations or the Brown 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"He offered to come so I took him up on his offer," she said. "I'm just 
thrilled because the governor of the state of California is coming to my 
hometown, Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian declined to comment on the ticket-fixing inquiry. Asked by reporters 
if he thought Wright was in trouble politically, he said: "Based on legislative 
accomplishments, she shouldn't have any problem getting reelected. But she does 
know you can't take anything for granted. You have to work hard, and you have 
to have adequate resources, and I'm happy to be here to help her."

CRITICS BESIEGE AIRPORT BOARD AT ITS 1ST NIGHTTIME MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank Airport commissioners, who for years have resisted demands to meet at 
night because they feared they would be swamped by protesters, held their first 
night meeting Monday. As they expected, they were swamped by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two hours, speaker after speaker accused the nine-member 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority of doing little or nothing to 
reduce Burbank Airport noise since buying the facility in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 85 people in attendance also cheered those who criticized the 
authority's proposal to soundproof nearby homes and schools, saying that the 
noise relief program was a cover for airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan -- the fruit of a federally sponsored noise control study -- 
about 2,300 homes and four schools would be insulated against noise over the 
next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We could live in Minnesota or Alaska if we wanted to live all boxed up," said 
Wally Berns, a leader of the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refusing Night Meetings 
</P>
<P>
For years, the authority held its twice-monthly meetings on Monday mornings, 
steadfastly refusing to meet in the evenings except for legally required public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Members expressed fears that much of the evening sessions would be taken up by 
repetitive and abusive comments from local gadflies, who they say contribute to 
prolonging the Burbank City Council's night meetings, often to six hours or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of established homeowner groups from communities west and south of 
Burbank complained that the morning sessions also prevented them from 
registering their opposition to airport noise and to what they view as the 
authority's inadequate response to the noise problem. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the Burbank Council, long an advocate of night meetings for the 
airport board, voted to televise authority meetings and broadcast them on 
community cable TV, with or without the authority's permission. 
</P>
<P>
In response, authority members agreed to Monday night's meeting and tentatively 
agreed to hold at least one night meeting every three months.

ROCKWELL MUST LIST ACCIDENTS, SHOW CRISIS PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DISCLOSURE ORDERED BY NUCLEAR OFFICIAL AS PART OF LICENSE RENEWAL REQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal nuclear official reviewing Rockwell International's request for 
renewal of a nuclear materials license at its Santa Susana lab has asked the 
firm for information about past chemical and radioactive releases and about 
emergency plans to cope with a serious accident. 
</P>
<P>
The requests by Peter B. Bloch, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission law judge 
presiding in the case, came in orders issued Friday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In one order, Bloch asked Rockwell to provide a chronological listing of "all 
significant chemical and radiological contamination incidents or releases at 
Santa Susana Field Laboratory . . . since 1969." He also asked for specifics on 
the substances spilled or released, the causes and corrective actions taken. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch said Monday he specified 1969 to get a record spanning 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the other order, Bloch asked Rockwell for information on the need for 
off-site emergency plans in the event of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reasonable Request' 
</P>
<P>
"We'll give him everything he wants," Paul Sewell, a spokesman for Rockwell's 
Rocketdyne division, said Monday. "It's a perfectly reasonable request." 
</P>
<P>
Concerning the emergency plan request, Sewell said Rockwell has an on-site 
"radiological contingency plan which satisfies" NRC regulations. "We're 
reviewing our plan now to see what references are made to any off-site 
emergency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch asked that the information be provided "at or prior to" a Sept. 29 
hearing in Van Nuys on the license renewal application. 
</P>
<P>
That hearing and a second one next week are in response to letters and 
petitions signed by 38 opponents of Rockwell's request for a 10-year license 
renewal. The opponents contend Rockwell has not managed Santa Susana safely and 
that a nuclear complex has no place in a densely populated area. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell says it has safely operated the field laboratory, which sits on a 
plateau in a rugged area of the Simi Hills west of Chatsworth and southeast of 
Simi Valley. The 2,668-acre site has been used mainly to test rocket engines 
for NASA and the Air Force, but a 290-acre portion has been devoted to nuclear 
research and development for the U.S. Department of Energy and its predecessor, 
the Atomic Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Both hearings are scheduled for Room 120 of the Van Nuys State Office Building 
at 6150 Van Nuys Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public to Take Part 
</P>
<P>
At the Sept. 28 session, scheduled from 7 to 10:30 p.m., Bloch will hear from 
the public, but the hearing is informal and comments will not be part of the 
official record. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 29, at 9:30 a.m., Bloch will consider whether to designate the 
opponents full parties in the case. If granted that status, they would be able 
to file written evidence and critiques of the application that Bloch would have 
to consider in the license decision. 
</P>
<P>
The license covers the "hot cell" at Santa Susana, a heavily shielded area 
where Rockwell performs nuclear experiments and recycles nuclear fuel. The 
recycling involves snipping open used nuclear fuel rods to remove plutonium and 
other radioactive materials, which are then packaged and shipped to government 
reservations for use in reactors or atomic weapons manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
The hot cell license expired earlier this summer but has been continued pending 
NRC review of the renewal application. 
</P>
<P>
Other nuclear activities at Santa Susana are not at stake in the case because 
they are not licensed by the NRC. Much of the nuclear work has been exempt from 
licensing under provisions of the Atomic Energy Act that allow the Department 
of Energy to function both as customer and regulator.

JUDGE REJECTS REQUEST TO BLOCK INVESTIGATION OF SEXUAL 'RITES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday refused to issue a court order barring Los Angeles 
police and the city attorney from investigating or prosecuting a Canyon Country 
couple who include sex acts in what they say are ancient religious rites. 
</P>
<P>
Will and Mary Ellen Tracy, convicted this month on misdemeanor prostitution 
charges, had sought a temporary retraining order to end what they charged was 
harassment by the Los Angeles Police Department and prosecutors in the city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
A temporary restraining order would not overturn their recent conviction but 
would spare the couple further harassment, Will Tracy said. The couple charged 
that undercover police officers are loitering near their new headquarters in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are under constant threat and surveillance," Mary Ellen Tracy 
told U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. Tracy said her followers 
were being "denied spiritual guidance" because they are intimidated by police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sexual Rites 
</P>
<P>
Tracy, 47, is the self-proclaimed high priestess of the Church of the Most High 
Goddess and claims to have had sex with more than 2,000 men in the name of 
religion. In the Tracys' church, women act as priestesses who absolve the sins 
of men through sexual rites. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say the church is a sham because male followers give the 
priestesses donations to take part in the rituals. The Tracys call the 
donations religious sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said it was unclear whether he could issue a temporary restraining order 
because the Tracys have related litigation pending in state courts. Will Tracy, 
51, acting as his own attorney, has argued that an undercover officer violated 
the separation of church and state by pretending to be a believer in the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne did not discuss the Tracys' church in detail but said there is a 
substantial question of whether the Church of the Most High Goddess is a bona 
fide religion. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy said he will take the next legal step and ask Byrne for a preliminary 
injunction against police and prosecutors Oct. 16. Byrne said he is willing to 
hear Tracy make further arguements on whether his court has jurisdiction over 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys said the church's income has plummeted since their arrest, forcing 
them to move to Glendale from the four-bedroom house in West Los Angeles, not 
far from the Beverly Center, that served as church headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys are scheduled to be sentenced Friday in Los Angeles Municipal Court 
but plan to ask for a mistrial.

WOULD-BE RESCUER THROWN OFF CLIFF, DIES FROM INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man died Monday of injuries he suffered when he was thrown 60 
feet off an overlook on Mulholland Drive after apparently going to the aid of 
two women being taunted by about a dozen youths, Los Angeles police reported. 
One suspect was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was thrown down the steep embankment of a roadside lookout point 
near Beverly Glen Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, Lt. Warren Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
Another would-be rescuer, Francisco Arevalo, 20, of Van Nuys, also was injured 
when he jumped down the embankment during the fight, police said. Arevalo told 
officers he knew the dead man, who appeared to be in his early 20s, only as 
"Carlos." 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested George Ubilles, 19, at his Van Nuys home Monday on suspicion of 
murder. Officers would not say what led them to Ubilles. 
</P>
<P>
The lookout is a popular gathering spot for young people on weekend nights, 
Knowles said. The victim was fatally injured about 1:30 a.m. Saturday when he, 
Arevalo and another unidentified man came to the aid of two young women who 
were being taunted by about a dozen young men. 
</P>
<P>
"The victims were in one of these groups of people who had gathered at the 
lookout," Knowles said. "Another group arrived on the scene, started bothering 
two females that were there and our two victims attempted to come to their 
rescue. They wound up victims themselves. They were beaten up. One was thrown 
over the edge. The other went down on his own after being beaten." The third 
man, apparently unharmed, fled in a pickup truck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said the two injured men landed in a ravine below the lookout. Los 
Angeles city firefighters rappelled down the embankment to rescue them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Arevalo was treated for cuts and bruises and released. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified victim died Monday at UCLA Medical Center of internal 
injuries.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The market seemed to shake off some of the recent junk-bond-crisis selling and 
manage a modest gain during the past three trading days, according to Irving 
Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The liquidity crisis in the junk bond market might have been a factor in the 
new low recorded by Imperial Corp. of America, which has a substantial junk 
bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the remaining San Diego stocks appear to be in a state of suspended 
animation, except for a handful that recently reported new developments. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc. USA, which had moved up $10 in the past 1 1/2 months, was hurt 
by an $4-million jury verdict for events that occurred before the company went 
public in 1983. The judgment, which is not fully covered by insurance, was 
awarded against the company ($2.5 million) and President Anthony W. DeSio ($1.5 
million). 
</P>
<P>
Rohr Industries continued to slip on a recent poor fourth-quarter report that 
prompted analysts to downgrade fiscal 1990 earnings projections. Merrill Lynch 
revised its estimate to $2.10 for the fiscal year ended July, 1990, down from a 
previous estimate of $2.70. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular Biosystems, which had gained $4 in the past 1 1/2 months, gave up 
$1.25 during the past three trading days. 
</P>
<P>
Charthouse Enterprises, which had its initial public offering at $13.50 a share 
and immediately moved to $14.625, saw some profit taking and hit a new low of 
$13. The stock reacted dramatically, falling $3 and regaining $1.50 on Monday.

A federal court jury has awarded $4 million in compensatory damages to Nancy 
Tash, daughter of the founder of Mail Boxes Etc. USA. The jury declined to 
award punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Tash had alleged that executives at the San Diego-based company fraudulently 
induced her to sell 500,000 shares in the company at a below-market price in 
1983, shortly before the company went public. 
</P>
<P>
In her lawsuit, Tash, the daughter of the late Gerald Aul, alleged that Mail 
Boxes President and Chief Executive Anthony W. DeSio defrauded her when he 
convinced her to sell a 23% stake in the company for $50,000 and a $300,000 
note. 
</P>
<P>
According to court papers, DeSio schemed to defraud Tash, a St. Louis resident, 
by telling her that Mail Boxes was not performing well. At the time, according 
to court filings by Tash, "Mail Boxes Etc. USA was achieving a high rate of 
growth, sales were up, its financial condition was improving and the prospects 
for higher near- and long-term profits had never been as certain." 
</P>
<P>
Tash alleged that DeSio told her the business "was not succeeding, and that it 
was in jeopardy," according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Tash's suit also alleged that she sold her shares only after DeSio promised her 
that all "selling shareholders would be treated exactly alike." Tash's attorney 
maintained in court that DeSio gave "special benefits" to Herbert Goffstein, a 
shareholder who later founded a separate company called Mail Boxes Coast to 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc. USA franchises postal and communications service centers. It 
now has operations in most of the United States, along with Puerto Rico and 
Canada. The company will open its 1,000th location Sept. 25. It recently 
entered the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
The company intends to appeal the U. S. District Court verdict, which was 
reached Friday, Mail Boxes spokeswoman Sandra Greenberg said Monday. GREG 
JOHNSON TCS Enterprises on Monday reported record earnings of $210,000 for the 
third quarter ended July 31, up from $37,000 during the like quarter a year 
ago. Revenue rose to $2.2 million, up from $1.7 million. Net income rose to 
$748,000 for the nine-month period ended July 31, up from $394,000 a year ago. 
Revenue for the nine-month period rose to $6.1 million, up from $4.9 million. 
San Diego-based TeleSoft and TeleLogic AB of Stockholm, Sweden, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Swedish Telecom, have completed a previously announced merger 
that created TeleSoft AB, a new software company. Other investors include 
Ericsson; Programator, a Scandinavian software company; Southwestern Bell Corp. 
and FFV, a company owned by the Swedish government.

Everything Old Is New Again Department: New York is expecting a new production 
of the old musical "The Band Wagon" to be on Broadway about this time next 
year. The nearly 60-year-old show -- with a score that includes "That's 
Entertainment" and "Dancing in the Dark" -- originally featured Fred and Adele 
Astaire, and Fred Astaire later starred in a film version with Cyd Charisse. 
The planned production will have a book by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, with 
Gene Saks set to direct. Max Weitzenhoffer, co-producer with Don Black, told 
the New York Times that "we're going to try for a musical that's fabulous in 
sound, not masses of scenery falling around. It will be a lot of fun. It's not 
going to be done for intellectual qualities." The cost: about $4.5 million.

Radio psychologist David Viscott will be back on KABC-AM (790) starting Monday 
afternoon, returning to the station from which he resigned in July. Viscott 
says he now finds it possible "to pursue my line of questioning and my 
programming again in a style which is natural to me." He left KABC last summer, 
he said, because of disagreements with then program director John Rook, who has 
since resigned. Viscott will be heard weekdays from 1-2 p.m. Sonya Friedman, 
who took over Viscott's 2-3 p.m. hour when he left, will continue in that slot.

A former television anchorman in Erie, Pa., has filed suit against his station, 
charging he was demoted because of his age. Hyle Richmond, 62, filed suit in 
U.S. District Court against WICU-TV and its parent company, Great Lakes 
Communications Inc., seeking reinstatement to his job as an on-air newscaster 
and anchorman. The suit claims that Richmond, after more than 30 years on the 
air, was demoted to a reporter's job on Sept. 28, 1987, and was replaced by 
Lisa Adams, who is in her early 30s. It further says the station also fired or 
demoted three other on-air newscasters or anchors who were more than 40 and 
replaced them with younger employees. Richmond is still employed by the 
station. ALEENE MacMINN

BUSH PROMISES HUNGARY EASIER TRADE TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

HELENA, Mont.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, in a measure intended to lend badly needed U.S. financial 
support, announced Monday that Hungary will be granted two major trade 
concessions as it undertakes extensive political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told a news conference here that the Central European nation will be 
granted permanent Most Favored Nation status -- which gives favorable trading 
positions to the United States' major trading partners -- and that it will be 
added to the list of nations given permanent permission to ship exports to the 
United States duty-free. 
</P>
<P>
The President's announcement -- reflecting the sharp relaxation in East-West 
tensions and the political and economic shifts that are opening up Hungarian 
society -- was made at the State Capitol of Montana at the end of a visit 
marking the state's centennial celebration. 
</P>
<P>
With East-West relations dominating the President's agenda this week, Bush also 
said at the news conference that his Administration is working on strategic 
arms control proposals "that I think will capture the imagination of the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "I do not see any insurmountable stumbling blocks" to such an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
He will meet Thursday at the White House with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze. Secretary of State James A. Baker III then will continue the 
discussions with the Soviet official later in the week in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
The President repeated earlier statements that it is premature to talk about a 
summit conference with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- a meeting that 
officials have indicated might take place within coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to talk about a productive, constructive meeting of the foreign 
ministers in Wyoming," Bush said. "I feel under no rush on that subject" of a 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the new status for Hungary does not move forward prospects of 
the Soviet Union being granted such trade concessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary in Hungary 
</P>
<P>
As Bush made his announcement on Hungary, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. 
Mosbacher was visiting Budapest. The heavily centralized Hungarian economy is 
not as efficient as traditional market economies, and many competing countries 
already have the trade preferences that were granted to Hungary on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While Hungary last week opened its borders and allowed unlimited emigration by 
East Germans to Austria on their way to West Germany, Bush said that his 
decision on trade concessions for Budapest was "in the mix before those 
dramatic happenings." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he formally notified Congress of the shift. The President already 
had said that Hungary would be the first East European nation to get permanent 
Most Favored Nation status, but he linked the move to passage by the Hungarian 
Parliament of legislation codifying its newly relaxed attitude toward East Bloc 
emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said in Budapest that the actual shift could occur in October if the 
Parliament acts on the emigration laws this month. 
</P>
<P>
The commerce secretary also said that Bush has submitted legislation to 
Congress that would extend the Overseas Private Investment Corp. program to 
Hungary, under which U.S. guarantees would be given to private U.S. companies 
investing there, and to create a $256-million private enterprise fund, to aid 
in the establishment of private business there. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Hungary exported $321 million worth of goods to the United States. Of 
that, about $110 million would be eligible for duty-free status. The Commerce 
Department estimates that full duty-free status under the Generalized System of 
Preferences would enable Hungary to increase exports to the United States by 
about $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
The permanent Most Favored Nation status is not likely to have an immediate 
financial impact, however, because Hungary already has such status on a 
temporary basis. It is expected to improve the availability of export financing 
and export credits, because it would give investors greater certainty about the 
U.S.-Hungarian trade relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"The dedication and diligence of the Hungarian people is quickly transforming 
the economic system into a more productive and competitive posture," Bush told 
the news conference from the floor of the Montana State Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden movement of thousands of East Germans through Hungary to West 
Germany has put renewed attention on the prospects for the reunification of 
Germany, divided since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
While such a step is "a matter for the Germans to decide," Bush said, "I do not 
think we should view that as bad for Western interests." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's been a dramatic change in post-World War II Germany," Bush 
said. "And so I don't fear it. . . . There is, in some quarters, a feeling, 
well, (to) reunify Germany would be detrimental to the peace of Europe . . . 
some way, and I don't accept that at all -- simply don't." 
</P>
<P>
The President also said that the United States will be able to accommodate all 
the Soviet Jews who have already applied for admission to this country, but he 
maintained that Washington must keep limits on immigration -- despite the 
suddenly relaxed Soviet attitude toward it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to have an overall immigration policy that keeps the control of 
our demographics in our hands," Bush said. For more than a decade, U.S. 
officials have repeatedly pressured their Soviet counterparts to allow 
unlimited emigration. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate is better" in the Soviet Union, Bush said, but he added that he is 
unable to say that no threats remain to Jews and others seeking the freedom to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had any message for narcotics traffickers who might be 
targeting members of his family, or other Americans, Bush said: "I take a 
rather dim view of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's speculation on this," he said. "But there is no hard 
intelligence evidence of such targeting. Clearly, any such action would, I 
think, just bring down the total wrath of the American people and the American 
government." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid. I have great confidence in the selflessness and in the 
thoroughness of the intelligence community and of the Secret Service," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No New Trend on Hostility' 
</P>
<P>
On other matters, Bush said: 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is no "federal statute that is going to take care of" the sort of 
racial incidents that have occurred recently, and there is no "new trend of 
racial hostility" emerging in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That a measure narrowly approved by the House Ways and Means Committee last 
week to cut the capital gains tax rate from a maximum of 33% to 19.6% should be 
enacted into law. "We'll fight for it on the (House) floor," Bush said. The 
House is expected to vote next week on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He sees no need to expand his ban on imports of semi-automatic assault 
weapons to cover the sale and manufacture of such weapons in this country. 
Referring to the massacre of seven people by a gunman firing an AK-47 
semi-automatic rifle, in Louisville, Ky., Thursday, Bush said that it is "very 
hard to legislate against aberrational behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bush announced that beginning next year, the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the Peace Corps will join forces to train a corps of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"As part of their standard preparation for duty, Peace Corps volunteers will be 
trained by the EPA to deal with a full range of environmental challenges: Water 
pollution prevention. Waste disposal. Reforestation. Pesticide management," 
Bush said in a speech here. 
</P>
<P>
"Armed with greater knowledge about our environment, our Peace Corps volunteers 
are going to help spread the word in the developing world. They'll work to stop 
pollution before it starts -- and ensure that economic development and 
environmental stewardship go hand in hand."

OPPRESSED ROMANIANS FLEE TO SANCTUARY IN HUNGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES T. POWERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a result of Hungary's liberal policies toward the East Bloc's political and 
economic refugees, an increasing number of Romanians are risking jail -- and 
occasionally the bullets of border guards -- in order to escape into Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 Romanians are registered as refugees here, many of them ethnic 
Hungarians fleeing the repressive policies of Romanian dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu, who is systematically destroying Hungarian villages in Transylvania 
in an attempt to force the villagers into industrial cities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ethnic Hungarians have been absorbed here with relative ease 
because they speak Hungarian, officials say the real problem lies with the 
number of non-Hungarian Romanians fleeing across the border -- a number 
increasing daily. 
</P>
<P>
Many, they say, have been lured by the news that about 20,000 East German 
refugees have been allowed by Hungary to emigrate to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the non-Hungarian Romanians, however, is that no third country 
is ready to accept them. The East Germans have all been granted automatic West 
German citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a problem that is worsening every day," said Laszlo Kovacs, who is 
Hungary's deputy foreign minister. "In August, 50% of the Romanians coming here 
were non-Hungarians. That means they do not know the language. They have 
trouble getting jobs here. They do not want to stay here. They want to go on to 
a third country. In the meantime, we must take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
Next month, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees will open an 
office in Budapest, the first allowed to operate in an East Bloc country. 
Hungarian officials say they hope the office will help speed the Romanian 
refugees on to permanent settlement in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 Romanians have been settled at a transient camp in the town of 
Bicske, near Budapest. Another large group of refugees is housed in the city of 
Debrecin in eastern Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Most new arrivals make their way to Budapest, where a government office has 
been established near the central bus station. Officials there try to find 
accommodations for them and, if possible, employment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting about 65 new arrivals every day," said Ferenc Nemeth, who heads 
the office. "About half of them are non-Hungarian-speaking Romanians, and for 
them it is very hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are unskilled workers, mostly with only primary-school education. 
They want to go on to somewhere else, so it is difficult to find them jobs. 
Some people don't want to hire them because they know they will leave soon. We 
find them jobs doing unskilled work in construction, sweeping, working in 
kitchens, whatever we can." 
</P>
<P>
Nemeth said his office gives priority in the hunt for housing to families with 
children. Because of a severe housing shortage in Budapest, where waiting lists 
for apartments range from 10 to 15 years, most are sent to smaller towns and 
cities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Single men, who represent the majority of the refugees, are often housed in 
worker hostels, three or four to a room. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Romanians crowding the office Monday were three young men who had 
spent the last three nights in the main train station in Budapest. They had 
crossed the border together Thursday night, they said, crawling the last 
several hundred yards through plowed fields, their escape aided by ground fog. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had caught us," said one of the men, 20-year-old Edmund Cleci, "they 
would have beaten us and thrown us in jail for nine months." Cleci said he 
spoke from experience, because this was his second escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to live there," said a 21-year-old named Marton, who asked 
that his last name not be used. "There is nothing. There is no meat. In the 
market there are only plums. Some people have potatoes now, if they have a 
garden, but there is nothing in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Another man, Stefan, 23, put in: "And when you work, you get paid nothing for 
your work. There is no hope for Romania now. That is what most of us think. If 
there was, I would not have left." 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is so bad," Cleci said, "that most people think it cannot get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
"Romania is racist," charged Ladislau Sirb, 24, who escaped from Romania two 
months ago and has been working as a painter on a construction project. "They 
have taken away our schools, they have taken down the street signs in 
Hungarian, they want to remove the Hungarian language from us." 
</P>
<P>
The three new arrivals came with only the clothes on their backs. The soles of 
Cleci's sneakers were peeling off in layers, but he smiled, as though his 
fortunes were already taking a turn for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"They are sending us to the Red Cross for some clothes and to a church for some 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He looked at Sirb, smiled, and added: "Our friend here says we may get a job 
where he is working. We can paint with him."

A landlord whose White Plains, N.Y., boardinghouse was gutted by a fire that 
killed eight people was convicted of criminally negligent homicide because the 
building failed to meet safety standards. State Supreme Court Justice Nicholas 
Colabella convicted Frank Thomas, 67, of New Rochelle of two counts but 
acquitted him of five additional counts. He had dismissed an eighth count 
earlier. Colabella's verdict came after a two-week, non-jury trial in New York 
state's trial-level court. A fire door was missing in the boardinghouse, and 
the front door was secured by a double dead-bolt lock, which required a key 
from the inside to open. Thomas was convicted on the two counts in the deaths 
of Abraham Wilson, 52, and Allen Piroleau, 61, whose bodies were found by the 
door they could not open. The Jan. 15 blaze began in the basement of the 
building through a resident's careless smoking.

WEAPONS PLANT WASTE ACCORD REACHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal energy and environmental officials announced an agreement for handling 
wastes from the federal Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver, an issue 
that had threatened to close the plant. The problem arose because of concern by 
officials from the Department of Energy and Rockwell International Corp., which 
runs the plant for the department, about their personal liability for the 
plant's failure to follow environmental laws by storing the mixed wastes at the 
plant. Long-term storage of such wastes at a production site is not allowed, 
yet there is no federally approved disposal site or treatment process for the 
wastes. Under the agreement, which first came to light last week, DOE will 
handle the wastes in compliance with hazardous waste storage requirements, and 
will minimize the generation of such wastes.

President Bush's impending summit conference on education is already a success 
simply because it is taking place, two Republican governors -- speaking on 
behalf of the National Governors Assn. -- said. No matter what happens next 
week in the closed sessions, Govs. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa and Garrey E. 
Carruthers of New Mexico told a Washington news conference, the spotlight will 
be on the national crisis in education. The conference is to take place at the 
University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Since 1986, the National Governors 
Assn. has issued extensive reports on education in America. Branstad and 
Carruthers called the news conference to issue this year's report, in which the 
governors renewed their call for "national education goals" to guide the states 
and local communities.

Ending an eleventh-hour political and legal drama that threatened to postpone 
San Diego's City Council elections, the city and the Chicano Federation reached 
an out-of-court settlement of the federation's lawsuit, thus allowing the first 
district-only council election since the City Charter was adopted in 1931. U.S. 
District Judge John S. Rhoades tentatively accepted a settlement of the 
class-action suit aimed at increasing the council's size and altering the way 
district boundaries are drawn. Rhoades had promised to hold hearings Monday on 
the federation's call for postponement of today's election if the two sides 
were unable to settle the 20-month-old suit.

The widow of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, questioned directly by the man 
convicted of killing her husband, said there is no chance he is innocent. 
"Unfortunately, there is no doubt," Lisbeth Palme said at an appeals hearing in 
Stockholm. She identified Christer Pettersson as the only person in sight on 
the downtown street corner where Palme was shot to death on the night of Feb. 
28, 1986. Pettersson, who has repeatedly denied that he was near the site of 
the slaying, was convicted in July. The appellate hearing, which began Sept. 
11, has largely been a rehash of trial testimony.

Growers of grapes for elite California wines are hoping for clearing skies and 
dry winds after heavy rains threatened fragile crops on the vine with rot and 
mildew. A tropical storm from the South Pacific and a winter storm from the 
Gulf of Alaska met in California over the weekend, sparking thunderstorms and 
dousing some regions with more than four inches of rain. "Once the rain stops, 
the wine grape people in Napa and Sonoma need a good strong wind to dry their 
grapes out," said Mike Henry, spokesman for the California Farm Bureau. "A lot 
of the growers were caught in the early stages, with stuff still on the vine." 
The storms also brought an unusual, early season snowfall to portions of the 
Sierra.

Eighteen retired Argentine generals and admirals facing trial on charges they 
committed hundreds of human rights abuses in the 1970s will be pardoned, 
President Carlos Saul Menem announced. The cases of six other people, including 
two former presidents already convicted and sentenced, will be reviewed later, 
Menem said. The statement was the first firm indication of those to be included 
in the controversial pardon, expected to be formally announced in late 
September. A government commission named by Menem's predecessor, former 
President Raul Alfonsin, determined that at least 9,000 Argentines disappeared 
during an anti-subversion campaign in the late '70s and early '80s.

Rocket and artillery barrages blasted Beirut after Christian army commander 
Michel Aoun rejected a proposed committee to monitor a cease-fire in his 
six-month war against Syrian troops. Lebanese police said the exchanges at 
times averaged 20 shells a minute and that six people were killed. Hundreds 
have been killed since March, when the most recent round of fighting began. The 
renewed dueling began after Maj. Gen. Aoun announced his rejection of a 
security committee proposed by Arab mediators over the weekend.

South Korea accepted a North Korean offer to resume parliamentary talks to 
discuss reunification of the Korean Peninsula, a National Assembly spokesman 
said in Seoul. Chief South Korean delegate Chae Mun Shick has sent a message to 
Pyongyang suggesting that the eighth round of talks be held Oct. 25 at the 
border truce village of Panmunjom, the spokesman said. The last round, aimed at 
reducing tensions on the peninsula, was in December, 1988. In July, Seoul 
suspended all talks with the Communist north after several southern dissidents 
made illegal trips across the border.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE TICKING GUAVA

It's September, and all over Asia the Festival of the Harvest Moon has cranked 
into gear. The crops are in, the fruit is ripe on the trees and one continuous 
celebration has started from the Philippines to Thailand. A happy time, a time 
when families get together. 
</P>
<P>
Except, of course, for the cousins who now live in Canoga Park. They are 
missing from the Harvest Moon, a whole ocean separating them, and so an aunt or 
uncle packs up a few guavas for easy travel to California. A memento to show 
the cousins they are not forgotten. From all the countries of Asia, the guavas, 
the tamarinds, the papayas are coming. 
</P>
<P>
The next time you hear a sortie of helicopters trundling over your roof, 
sprinkling malathion to beat back the latest attack of fruit flies, you might 
think about the Harvest Moon and those otherwise innocent packages. Because 
there is a connection. California, once a biological island on the land, is an 
island no more. And we are all paying the cost. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area alone, there have been seven outbreaks of Oriental 
fruit flies in the past year. That is a record. In all of California, half the 
fruit fly infestations in the state's history have occurred in the last five 
years. This summer, you may have noticed, the helicopters were flying in the 
north and in the south at the same time. We are under siege. 
</P>
<P>
And the main source of that siege is a matter of some delicacy. Agriculture 
officials are uncomfortable about fingering California's newest wave of 
immigrants as the culprits in the escalation of the bug war. But there's no 
escaping it. Many of those care packages coming by first-class mail from the 
Asian motherlands also carry some of the most destructive fruit flies on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal, of course, to send fruits and vegetables through the mails. But 
who knows about those laws in the dusty, small towns of the Philippines? And so 
they keep packing and sending, jet load after jet load. 
</P>
<P>
The next few weeks will be the worst time of the year, as the harvest festivals 
reach their peaks. After that, there will be smaller upticks with the advent of 
Buddhist holidays. Some agricultural officials believe they can see a 
correlation between these Eastern calender events and the surges of fruit fly 
outbreaks here. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are considerable in this war. California agriculture produces about 
$16.2 billion worth of crops a year, and the vast majority are threatened by 
one or another of the fruit flies. If just one outbreak gets away from the 
state, the results would be catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
In the infamous 1980-81 outbreak of the Medfly, which came close to doing just 
that, the eventual costs were $200 million and most experts believe the state 
got off lucky. Hawaii and Florida have been less fortunate. Both those states 
have surrendered some crops to permanent fruit fly infestations, meaning they 
cannot be exported without expensive fumigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, this kind of threat might have served as the trigger for a replay 
of the yellow peril business. But that has not happened, and it's reassuring. 
Maybe we've grown beyond that. Agriculture officials have kept their response 
low-key in spite of a growing sense of crisis inside the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
What they have done is quietly lobby for a revision in federal laws that would 
enlarge their powers to inspect first-class mail packages. Right now, even a 
package oozing juice from decaying fruit cannot be opened by inspectors because 
of privacy laws. If a postal worker notices oozing, he is required to reseal 
the package and send it along to the addressee. 
</P>
<P>
And next to the drug-sniffing German shepherds at Customs, there are now 
beagles who sniff for fruits and vegetables. Every day they nab a few guavas 
nestled among the nightshirts. 
</P>
<P>
They had better succeed, because the relative isolation of California, flanked 
by deserts on the east and the Pacific on the west, clearly will no longer 
serve to protect the state. And it is possible that one day a hungry bug will 
arrive -- by jet, of course -- that the plant scientists cannot stop with their 
sprays. 
</P>
<P>
Already, in the past several years, five species of all-new fruit flies have 
been trapped in California. They had never been seen here or anywhere else in 
North America. And one fly was special indeed. 
</P>
<P>
A trap inspector brought this fly to the agricultural lab in Los Angeles for 
identification. The entomologists looked, dissected, and were puzzled. This fly 
was nowhere on the charts. They concluded it was a fly that had never been 
categorized, perhaps had never been seen before by scientists anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't know where it came from or, more important, what it liked to eat. 
They still don't.

CORCORAN GALLERY APOLOGIZES FOR CANCELLATION OF EXHIBIT 
</P>

<P>
The director and executive trustees of the embattled Corcoran Gallery of Art 
issued a statement Monday expressing "regret" for offending members of the arts 
community with their cancellation of a show of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, 
and said: "Our course in the future will be to support art, artists and freedom 
of artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran Director Christina Orr-Cahall said the significance of Monday's action 
"is really not about the statement per se; it's about the fact that the 
statement is real and that the trustees and I do feel regret and felt that the 
approach we took did not work. . . . It was a failed strategy and probably on 
my part naive. That's much more important than any piece of paper or 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
When she announced the cancellation in June, Orr-Cahall said she hoped to avoid 
exacerbating a growing political crisis surrounding the National Endowment for 
the Arts and federal funding of controversial art. She and others involved in 
the decision have previously expressed regret for any distress their action 
gave artists, using much the same language as they did Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike this statement, earlier comments have not been offered as apologies. 
"This is a symbolic gesture," Orr-Cahall explained, "and one that we needed to 
make and that we wanted to make. The Corcoran's strategy had not been 
successful, clearly, and we needed to really make a statement that let the 
artistic community know where we stood." 
</P>
<P>
The full statement reads: "The Corcoran Gallery of Art, in attempting to defuse 
the NEA funding controversy by removing itself from the political spotlight, 
has instead found itself in the center of controversy. By withdrawing from the 
Mapplethorpe exhibition, we, the board of trustees and the director, have 
inadvertently offended many members of the arts community, which we deeply 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
"Our course in the future will be to support art, artists and freedom of 
artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 3 1/2 months, the Corcoran has been buffeted by criticism from 
the art world, an artists' boycott that has forced the cancellation of two 
exhibitions and endangered a third, as well as the withdrawal by artist Lowell 
Nesbitt of more than $1 million in property and art that he had intended to 
will the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Far-out!" said Nesbitt when the statement was read to him. "It's a little bit 
overdue, but I am very happy that they could bring themselves to make that 
statement. It is long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks Proof 
</P>
<P>
However, Nesbitt said that although that portion of his estate intended for the 
Corcoran will end up in Washington, he will not return it to the gallery. 
"Their position has yet to be proven," said Nesbitt, adding that its 
destination is still being negotiated. Painter Annette Lemieux, who canceled 
her one-woman show that had been scheduled to open at the Corcoran next month, 
was more skeptical. "That's very safe," she said of the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Orr-Cahall said that the statement was only the first "dramatic step forward" 
in a campaign still under development to win back the respect and cooperation 
of the artistic community. She said she had spoken earlier in the day to some 
of the artists who have withdrawn from Corcoran shows, and that "they seem 
pleased. I think they recognize it as a major step on the part of the 
Corcoran."

BATTLESHIP'S GUNPOWDER TESTS CONFIRMED 
</P>

The Navy on Monday acknowledged that the crew of the battleship Iowa was 
conducting "unauthorized experiments" with gunpowder charges in its 16-inch 
guns at the time of the April blast that killed 47 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The naval board investigating the explosion recommended that the officers and 
sailors involved in the tests be punished and that a complete inquiry into the 
improper experiments be conducted by the Navy's inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy insisted Monday that the gunnery experiments had nothing to do 
with the explosion in Turret 2 -- an explosion that the Navy continues to 
maintain was probably caused by a suicidal sailor, Petty Officer Clayton M. 
Hartwig of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
In response to complaints from members of Hartwig's family, Ohio lawmakers have 
called for a congressional investigation of the blast and the Navy's accusation 
that Hartwig caused it. Democratic Sens. John Glenn and Howard M. Metzenbaum 
and Democratic Rep. Mary Rose Oakar have asked the House and Senate Armed 
Services committees to conduct an independent inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's four-month, $4-million investigation concluded that the catastrophic 
April 19 explosion was caused by a deliberate act of sabotage, "most likely" by 
Hartwig, who was the sailor closest to the breech of the 16-inch gun. 
</P>
<P>
Based on testimony from hundreds of witnesses and on extensive laboratory 
tests, the Navy theorized that Hartwig inserted a homemade detonator between 
the first and second 110-pound bags of gunpowder in the gun, then ordered the 
rammer to compress the powder until the bags exploded. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation found that the gun was loaded with five rather than the 
authorized six bags of black powder in a test designed to improve the range and 
accuracy of the 16-inch guns. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also found that the gun was loaded with a high-explosive mixture known 
as D-846, which is only supposed to be used in smaller quantities than were 
used and only with lighter projectiles than the 2,700-pound shell loaded into 
the gun at the time of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa Capt. Fred P. Moosally said he had not authorized and was not aware of the 
experiment with the powder and the shell in Turret 2. He said he thought the 
"reduced charge" that the crew was planning to fire meant six 55-pound bags of 
powder rather than the five 110-pound bags that exploded in the gun barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The tests were supervised by Master Chief Petty Officer Steven P. Skelly, an 
Iowa crew member since 1987. Skelly -- who was not in Turret 2 when the blast 
occurred -- is considered to be one of the Navy's top gunners, continually 
pushing the guns to their limit and trying new combinations of powder and 
projectile, Navy investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunnery experiments aboard the Iowa were informally directed by the Naval 
Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Dahlgren, 
Va. Along with the FBI, those organizations conducted the laboratory tests that 
determined that the April blast could only have been caused by a deliberate act 
of sabotage and not by an accidental misfire. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman said Monday that NAVSEA's role in the Iowa investigation was 
not a conflict of interest because no other organization had the expertise to 
study an accident involving 16-inch naval guns. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan, head of the team that investigated the Iowa 
disaster, found that Skelly had engaged in "unauthorized research and 
development" with the battleship's main guns. He recommended that Skelly be 
disciplined for exceeding his orders and that Moosally be brought before an 
investigative panel to answer for his lack of crew supervision.

QUAYLE TELLS ALASKANS U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL COMPLETE CLEANUP IF EXXON DOESN'T

<TEXT>
<P>
Fulfilling one of the duties of a vice president -- going where the President 
does not want to go -- Dan Quayle arrived here Monday en route to a 10-day tour 
of the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials had planned to have President Bush go to Alaska this week 
to meet with local officials and inspect the results of Exxon Corp.'s cleanup 
of the massive Valdez oil spill. But Bush aides feared that a visit now, just a 
few days after Exxon halted its uncompleted cleanup for the winter, would be 
politically risky for the President, so they canceled the trip and pressed 
Quayle into service instead. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Quayle are his wife, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner 
and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discusses Fishing Issues 
</P>
<P>
The vice president met with local officials to discuss the cleanup, then with 
fishing industry representatives interested in a new fishing agreement recently 
negotiated by the United States, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, who had visited here four months ago, said after his meetings: "The oil 
spill has not been cleaned up. We are committed to making sure the cleanup 
takes place." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if that meant the federal government would take over the job if 
Exxon did not resume the cleanup after the winter, the vice president said: 
"Yes . . . we will stay until the job is completed." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle said that he now has a much better understanding of the environmental 
damage caused by the large drift nets used by Asian fishermen. He said that one 
of the goals of his trip would be to press the Koreans to sign the fishing 
agreement, which curbs use of such nets. It already has been signed by Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The brief interlude of environmental issues contrasts with the bulk of Quayle's 
trip, which, the vice president told members of the foreign press corps at a 
Washington briefing last week, will concentrate on "collective security." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will visit Korea, Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia before returning 
to Washington a week from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
White House aides have sought to use foreign travel to rehabilitate Quayle's 
political image, which was badly battered during last fall's political 
campaign. The current trip has been designed to capitalize on Quayle's personal 
interest in issues of defense and space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
The trip is Quayle's fourth foreign mission and the second to Asia since he 
took office. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the political rehabilitation plan appears to be having mixed success. 
Polls, including a recent one conducted by the Washington Post, show the public 
giving Quayle broad approval for his performance as vice president but 
continuing to doubt that he is qualified to be President, a result that Quayle 
insists does not disturb him. 
</P>
<P>
On the current trip, Quayle is scheduled to arrive first in Korea, where he 
will meet with Korean President Roh Tae Woo but also with opposition leaders, 
including Kim Dae Jung, whom the government has indicted on charges of 
indirectly receiving money from North Korea. Kim has vehemently denied the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
After Korea, Quayle will travel to Tokyo to begin a five-day tour of Japan. He 
plans to visit Japanese space facilities and discuss expanded U.S.-Japanese 
cooperation in space exploration. Bush has assigned Quayle to head the National 
Space Council, an intergovernmental panel designed to coordinate U.S. space 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Visit Philippines 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will travel from Japan to the Philippines, where the continued presence 
of U.S. military bases probably will dominate discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The bases are likely to be the major topic on Quayle's final stop -- in 
Malaysia. Last month, the government of the neighboring island of Singapore 
suggested that it would be willing to accept U.S. naval facilities should the 
Philippines insist on closing the massive Subic Bay installation. 
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government, which has had tense relations with Singapore in the 
past, reacted strongly against that idea.

MOTHER TERESA'S ILLNESS CASTS PALL OVER FOLLOWERS;

IN CALCUTTA, PRAYERS -- AND GLOOM

CALCUTTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last two weeks, the Sisters of Charity have been praying in shifts on 
the second floor of the House for the Dying and Destitute, chanting the rosary 
and singing "Ave Maria" into the night. 
</P>
<P>
On the floor below, other nuns, clad in simple white saris, have continued 
their work alongside volunteers from the United States, Europe and Asia, going 
from cot to cot tending to dozens of living skeletons, as they have for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a sadness in the air these days in the decaying old building in 
the heart of Calcutta's slums, a fear that the woman who started what many 
believe is the most selfless crusade in modern history may soon be gone. 
</P>
<P>
Her portrait hangs in a corner of the room where Calcutta's poorest can now die 
with dignity, near a sign that spells out her life's dream: "The greatest aim 
of human life is to die in peace with God." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failing Health 
</P>
<P>
The message is signed by Mother Teresa, and although none of the nuns will even 
discuss it, it is the failing health of their Mother Superior that has brought 
such gloom to the city where she began her Missionaries of Charity movement 
nearly 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The vigil has not been confined to Mother Teresa's mission, or to her modern 
headquarters building. Since the 79-year-old Yugoslav-born nun was admitted to 
a nursing home with heart problems Sept. 5, her seesaw struggle to live has 
spread concern throughout the city, touching everyone from the street people to 
whom she has dedicated her life to the most senior government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bulletins on the state of her health are flashed on state television and 
carried in all the national newspapers. Last week, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 
flew to Calcutta with his wife to pay a 10-minute visit to the woman whom many 
regard as a living saint. 
</P>
<P>
So strong is the concern that a state official held a news conference Sunday to 
criticize the officials who have been visiting Mother Teresa in the 
intensive-care unit of Woodland's Nursing Home, situated in Calcutta's most 
affluent neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows what infections even these officials may be carrying with them," 
said H. A. Halim, Speaker of the state legislature of West Bengal state. 
</P>
<P>
There have been conflicting reports about Mother Teresa's condition, and this 
has contributed to the uncertainty about her. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday and Monday, the bulletins seemed favorable. "Mother's fever is nearly 
gone," the Monday bulletin said, suggesting that her condition had improved. 
But a morning newspaper carried a headline saying, "Mother Teresa Not Out of 
Danger." 
</P>
<P>
One bulletin, reported by telephone, indicated that her condition had 
deteriorated because she was receiving what was recorded as "heart massage." In 
fact, the bulletin had said "cardiac message," and it referred to the impulses 
from a pacemaker that had been installed days before. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of clear medical information has spawned rumors, including death 
scares, reports of a power struggle within the Missionaries of Charity and 
often-reported but unconfirmed criticism that the nursing home was responsible 
for Mother Teresa's persistent fever because the pacemaker installed by its 
doctors was infected. 
</P>
<P>
The rumors have endured in part because Mother Teresa is not strong enough to 
meet with the press. Sister Priscilla, who has been designated the order's 
spokeswoman on the subject, has grown weary of the constant demand for news. 
</P>
<P>
"Not more newsmen," she said with a sigh Sunday night as three Western 
journalists paid a call on the mission's headquarters during evening prayers. 
Nevertheless, she said she had visited Mother Teresa that afternoon and that 
"she hopes to come home soon." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she believed that Mother Teresa would actually return soon, Sister 
Priscilla said: "I don't know, but we all pray that she may come back as soon 
as possible. We all miss her." 
</P>
<P>
She appeared to be on the verge of tears. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway across town, at Mother Teresa's hospice for the destitute, there seemed 
to be little time for rumors or speculation. 
</P>
<P>
It was here that Mother Teresa opened her home in 1948, 19 years after she came 
to Calcutta as a convent teacher with the Loreto order of Ireland. And it was 
here that she built an international organization that now includes 335 
orphanages, hospices, refugee centers, clinics, AIDS centers and homes for the 
destitute in 66 countries on five continents. 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance to the Calcutta hospice is a sign that says, "Welcome to 
Mother's First Love, Home for the Destitute and Dying." 
</P>
<P>
One of the nuns, who agreed to talk with a reporter Monday on the condition 
that her name not be used, said Mother Teresa came to the hospice often when 
she was well, even though she maintains 151 other homes in India. 
</P>
<P>
She conceded that the mood has changed here since the Mother Superior was 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone here is very sad," she said. "Yes, we are worried, and always there 
is someone upstairs, praying for Mother's recovery." 
</P>
<P>
In the huge hospice room, moving constantly among the green cots occupied by 
"pavement dwellers" waiting for death or a miracle, were a dozen of the foreign 
volunteers who are always here. Two years ago, former California Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr. worked here for several weeks. Tourists and other travelers often 
stop for a few days or weeks to lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attracts Everyone 
</P>
<P>
Andy Wimmer, a former West German banker, is one of many repeat visitors. 
Wimmer, who has spent a total of a year and a half at the home since 1985, is 
closer than most to the home and its creator. 
</P>
<P>
"The great power of Mother Teresa," he said, "is that she is not only the 
mother of the poor -- even the rich are attracted by her ideas." 
</P>
<P>
It is in this universal attraction, Wimmer said, that he senses the greatest 
potential impact if Mother Teresa does not recover. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I think that less money would come into the mission if Mother is 
not around," he said. "She is a very charismatic figure, and probably none of 
the other sisters could match that." 
</P>
<P>
But otherwise, he said, little would change in the Missionaries of Charity if 
its founder were gone. 
</P>
<P>
"The order is well-established now," he said. "The life and the work will not 
be disrupted."

Opposition lawmaker Boris N. Yeltsin shopped and drank until he dropped on his 
tour of the United States, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda told its 
readers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party maverick "leaves behind him a wake of catastrophic 
prophecies, insane expenses, interviews and above all the perfume of Jack 
Daniels Black Label," the left-leaning Italian newspaper La Repubblica said in 
a Page 5 article translated into Russian and printed on the front page of 
Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda did not comment on the article, which said Yeltsin found the United 
States "a holiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers long." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived back in Moscow late Monday, denied the report. "It's 
garbage," he told the Associated Press, flushing with anger. "It's a simple 
lie, slander, and revenge for the fact that Americans received us with 
admiration." 
</P>
<P>
The article is potentially very damaging to the silver-haired, 58-year-old 
populist who has become a hero to many Soviets by criticizing special 
privileges for party and government officials and urging that President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev speed up his reforms. 
</P>
<P>
But previous attacks on Yeltsin have been regarded by his supporters as an 
effort by powerful Kremlin figures to discredit him, and Yeltsin has turned 
that deep-rooted suspicion of central authority to his advantage.

HUNGARY, ISRAEL RENEW TIES CUT IN 1967

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government continued to press its independent foreign policy initiatives 
Monday, becoming the first East European regime to restore full diplomatic 
relations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and all the East Bloc countries except Romania severed 
relations with Israel after the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Hungary, along with 
Poland, has been carefully re-establishing contacts with the Jewish state over 
the last two years. Hungary, quickly followed by Poland, opened an "interests 
office" in Tel Aviv in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration of full diplomatic ties was announced by the Hungarian news 
agency MTI soon after the arrival of Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who 
termed the Hungarian move a matter of "historic significance." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry said they expect the resumption of 
relations to lead to a sharp increase in trade between the two countries. 
Israeli-Hungarian trade had already doubled since the opening of the interests 
office and had reached a total of $31.5 million by the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"These ties will bring economic, social and political benefits to both Hungary 
and Israel," Arens said in an interview with Israel Radio broadcast from 
Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 Jews live in Hungary, the second-largest Jewish community in East 
Europe after the Soviet Union's. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Jewish community, its leaders say, is beginning to regain its 
identity after years of silence under the Communists. About 600,000 Hungarian 
Jews were deported to concentration camps in 1944, near the end of World War 
II. About 300,000 survivors emigrated to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Gyula Horn told MTI that the resumption of ties after 22 years 
marks another step in Hungary's reform drive and an attempt to correct what he 
called past mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary is against confrontation, endorses dialogue and wants good 
relationships based on mutual advantages," Horn was quoted as saying. "This 
step is not aimed against anybody and will probably be helpful in solving the 
Middle East conflict." 
</P>
<P>
He said the move will not impair Hungary's relations with Arab countries, 
pointing out that a major Arab country, Egypt, has established formal ties with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic move came eight days after Hungary angered its hard-line East 
Bloc neighbors, particularly East Germany and Czechoslovakia, by deciding to 
allow vacationing East Germans to cross its newly opened border with Austria 
and settle in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Under Monday's agreement, the head of Israel's interests office in Budapest, 
Shlomo Meron, becomes the Israeli ambassador. Hungary's corresponding office in 
Tel Aviv also becomes an embassy, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
Four weeks ago, the World Jewish Congress said Hungary had begun allowing 
Soviet Jews to fly to Israel through Budapest, making Hungary the second East 
European country to permit the transit of such emigrants. Romania has been 
allowing Soviet Jews to transit through Bucharest for several years.

BATTERED COMMUNISTS SEEK NEW POLISH ROLE

Poland's Communist Party on Monday launched a potentially historic effort to 
pull itself back from the brink of political destruction and become the first 
Communist party in the East Bloc to find a niche for itself in a pluralistic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very special moment," Leszek Miller, a member of the party 
Politburo, said as he opened the party's first leadership meeting since it gave 
up its monopoly on power to a Solidarity-led coalition government earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
He said the party will transform itself into "a new socialist party" able to 
compete in democratic conditions, or "we will inevitably be pushed aside to the 
margin of political life, and we will be dominated and removed not only by 
Solidarity but also by other political forces." 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented action meant to underline the party's commitment to a new 
style, the party Central Committee opened the first phase of Monday's meeting 
to the Western press. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership meeting was called to begin preparations for a congress early 
next year that is expected to overhaul the party's ideology, its statutes and 
possibly its name. It is known officially as the Polish United Workers' Party. 
The current session is to take place in two parts, with no decisions made until 
later this month after a plebiscite among party members on alternate 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skepticism Over Survival 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are skeptical about whether the party can survive local elections 
scheduled for next year and national elections in 1993 no matter what it does. 
Others expect the party to split under the pressures of trying to reform 
itself, with either the more liberal wing or the conservative hard-liners 
breaking away if the debate over strategy goes against them. 
</P>
<P>
"It never happened that a Communist party could cope with democracy and 
freedom," Solidarity official Bronislaw Geremek said Monday in an interview. He 
is chairman of the labor movement's 161-member parliamentary delegation and 
principal adviser to its chairman, Lech Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the end of the Communist Party," Geremek went on, "and I think one can 
say it proudly. They know it and we know it. The question is only how to go 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the future of the Communist Party is "the main political question at 
the moment, and it was so from the beginning of this process." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist parties of Western Europe compete in pluralistic systems, but 
they have never been in a position of obtaining power and then having to 
relinquish it. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish Communists, installed in power by Soviet troops nearly 45 years ago 
at the end of World War II, were soundly defeated by Solidarity-backed 
candidates last June in elections for Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
They now control four of the 23 Cabinet-level posts in the new coalition 
government and the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised address last week, party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski 
warned "all members and sympathizers to understand that there is no return to 
the party's old role." And he added: "With the mechanisms of power in its 
hands, the (party) has been growing weaker and weaker over the years. It is now 
ridding itself of many burdens and faces a historic opportunity to boost its 
political vitality and influences." 
</P>
<P>
From a peak of over 3 million members in the late 1970s, party membership has 
fallen to a reported 2 million, while the average age of its members has risen 
from 40 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
At least a million party members, according to Rakowski, hold jobs in the civil 
service and the country's economic administration under the so-called 
nomenklatura system of reserving key jobs throughout society for party members. 
And they feel particularly threatened as the Solidarity prime minister, Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, begins to overhaul the government and economic bureaucracies in an 
attempt to halt a national tailspin.

5 PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN RACIST KILLING; 4 STAY FREE ON BOND

Five white defendants pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of murder in the 
racist killing of a black youth. Four were allowed to remain free on bail, 
prompting an angry outcry from the victim's father. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have kept them in here," Moses Stewart, father of Yusuf Hawkins, 
shouted at Justice Thaddeus Owens at state court in Brooklyn. "Letting 
murderers walk home . . . !" 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before, Owens accepted pleas of not guilty from James Patino, 24, Keith 
Mondello, 18, Pasquale Raucci, 19, and Joseph Serrano, 19. The alleged 
triggerman, Joseph Fama, 18, appeared in court later and also pleaded not 
guilty. He is being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, 16, was shot to death on Aug. 23 when he and three friends went to the 
predominantly white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to look at a used car that 
had been advertised for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The four black youths were set upon by a group of about 30 whites carrying 
bats, golf clubs and at least one gun. Police said that the whites mistakenly 
believed that Hawkins and his companions were friends of a white neighborhood 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
The case has raised racial tensions in the city and is believed to have been a 
factor in Mayor Edward I. Koch's defeat in last week's Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, Owens rejected a request from Assistant Dist. Atty. Paul 
Burns to revoke the $75,000 bail of Serrano and Patino because it had been set 
when they were facing only assault charges. They have since been indicted for 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
But Owens, saying he "doesn't know anything about the case," said he must still 
review the grand jury minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll leave the bail as it is and see what kind of case the people have," 
Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
Mondello is out on $100,000 bail and Raucci is out on $75,000 bail. Burns said 
he was not legally able to ask for any change in their bail because the charges 
against them had not changed.

11 HELD HOSTAGE IN CLASSROOM BY ARMED STUDENT; 
</P>

SHOTS FIRED IN KENTUCKY INCIDENT BUT NO ONE IS HURT; YOUTH SURRENDERS

An armed teen-ager stalked into a high school classroom and took 11 classmates 
hostage Monday, police and witnesses said. After a daylong standoff, he 
released them all and surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the confrontation, which lasted about 8 1/2 hours, police 
said. The youth fired two shots, one at the ceiling of the classroom and 
another at a window, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon entering the classroom, the teen-ager ordered the teacher and the first 
two rows of students to leave. The youth, who asked police to contact his 
father, told his hostages that he did not want to hurt anyone. The youth gave 
up an hour and a half after releasing his last two hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage-taker was identified by police as Dustin Pierce, a 17-year-old 
Jackson County High School senior, who was described as a good student. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were unsure what charges would be lodged against Pierce. He 
was taken to a juvenile holding center in the Clay County Jail in nearby 
Manchester. McKee is a town of 250 people about 50 miles southeast of Lexington 
in the Appalachian foothills. 
</P>
<P>
"He was unbalanced," said state police Detective Bob Stephens, who negotiated 
with Pierce throughout the day. "He was a confused young man. He was a young 
man looking for somebody to help him." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the negotiations, Stephens said he feared that Pierce would try to 
kill himself since he seemed to be carrying out the scenario of the Stephen 
King thriller "Rage," which he had been reading. 
</P>
<P>
During a search of Pierce's room at home, police found a paperback copy of the 
book, in which the lead character is shot by police. The book's plot deals with 
a youth who holds a classroom of students hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Police also found papers Pierce had written that made references to dying at 9 
o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's father, who was not identified, was on his way to McKee from Delray 
Beach, Fla., when the student released his last two hostages and surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce released his hostages throughout the day in exchange for items such as 
food, soft drinks and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Police Trooper Ed Robinson said the hostage-taker was armed with a shotgun, a 
.357-caliber magnum revolver and "some type of automatic pistol."

A Senate Democratic task force to assess the nation's housing needs and 
recommend reforms in the Department of Housing and Urban Development was named 
Monday by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston of California, named to head the eight-member task force, 
said one of its purposes will be to prod the Bush Administration to take a 
position on housing for the disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still people in the Administration who don't want to see any 
national housing programs," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the eventual aim is to forge a bipartisan approach on housing and 
produce a bill President Bush will sign. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems of housing affordability are not going away; they continue to 
build pressure on millions of Americans," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
"Young families find it harder to buy their first home. Older people can't find 
housing that enables them to live with dignity and independence. The supply of 
decent housing that low-income people can afford is fast disappearing. 
Homelessness remains a shame on the nation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said that the task force will issue a report and make recommendations 
by the end of the year. He said comprehensive housing legislation "will be a 
high priority for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he believes such a bill should include a sweeping overhaul of 
HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the task force are Sens. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut; 
Bob Graham, Florida; John Kerry, Massachusetts; Barbara A. Mikulski, Maryland; 
Donald W. Riegle Jr., Michigan; Terry Sanford, North Carolina, and Paul S. 
Sarbanes, Maryland.

S. JOAN MIER; HELPED FOUND CHILDREN'S CAMPS IN MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
S. Joan Mier, attorney, philanthropist and author whose major charities 
involved the establishment of two camps in Malibu for children, died Sunday in 
Los Angeles. The widow of Harry A. Mier, with whom she wrote several self-help 
books, she was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York into a family of 10 children and raised in Cleveland, she came 
to California in 1927 after passing the Ohio Bar. She was in private practice 
when she married Mier, the management consultant credited with helping 
establish Max Factor as a major cosmetics force. 
</P>
<P>
Together they wrote such books as "Happiness Begins Before Breakfast" and "The 
Power You Have." 
</P>
<P>
They founded their first children's camp, Camp Hess Kramer (named for a friend) 
on a 120-acre site in Malibu where, under the auspices of the Wilshire 
Boulevard Temple, it offers various youth programs. The Miers then donated land 
to the Crippled Children's Society for Camp Joan Mier, also in Malibu, for 
crippled children who suffer additionally from heart and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
After Mier's death in 1971, his wife donated land for the Harry A. Mier Center 
in Inglewood which also was donated to the Crippled Children's Society. 
</P>
<P>
Her other community activities included the Music Center, Wilshire Boulevard 
Temple, Hillcrest Country Club, United Jewish Welfare Fund and the Jewish Home 
for the Aging. Although she and her husband were childless, Mrs. Mier was named 
"Mother of the Year" in 1969 by Helping Hand of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977 she became the first woman president of the Crippled Children's 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include three sisters and a brother. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service will be held at 10 a.m. today at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, 
Los Angeles.

KRICKSTEIN HAS BRACED HIMSELF IN COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 22, he plays with his left knee wrapped in a brace the size of a saddle, so 
Aaron Krickstein has already learned the important tennis lesson that a service 
break is not nearly as severe as a bone break. 
</P>
<P>
If he just could have hit a tennis ball with a crutch, Krickstein surely would 
have been top 10 material again. 
</P>
<P>
Circumstances changed quickly. In 1985, when Krickstein checked in at No. 7 in 
the world, patient was his style at the baseline, not his hospital status. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up there once, then I fell down," Krickstein said. "Now I'm coming back 
and people probably don't think I can get back up there again." 
</P>
<P>
For the former freestyle and butterfly swimming champion of Michigan at age 5 
and 6, it's either sink or swim in Krickstein's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
You can follow the path of Krickstein's six-year pro career and coincidental 
accident rate, sort of a story of life and limbs, with the use of a medical 
chart. 
</P>
<P>
Feet: 
</P>
<P>
1984 -- Stress fracture right foot, metal pin inserted, out five months. 
</P>
<P>
1985 -- Stress fracture left foot, out two months. 
</P>
<P>
1986 -- Stress fracture left foot again, out three months. 
</P>
<P>
Legs: 
</P>
<P>
1987 -- Stress fracture left tibia, out 4 months. 
</P>
<P>
Torso: 
</P>
<P>
1987 -- Two broken ribs, out 2 months. 
</P>
<P>
If this sounds like a tennis player, it's purely by accident. The broken ribs, 
yeah, maybe they hurt the worst, Krickstein said, looking back on the whole 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein had just finished his first practice in four months with the broken 
leg and got into a taxicab on Long Island that would take him to where he was 
staying. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein's driver ran a red light and the taxicab was hit broadside by 
another car. Two of Krickstein's ribs were broken. 
</P>
<P>
"That one was pretty bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation became so critical that Krickstein was even forced to twice miss 
the U.S. Open, his favorite tournament, because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
But now, things are looking up for Krickstein. He's on a two-year relatively 
injury-free streak and he's coming off his first Grand Slam semifinal 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Open, Krickstein was the next-to-last player to lose to Boris 
Becker on his way to the championship. Becker took out Krickstein, 6-4, 6-3, 
6-4, in the semifinal, then defeated Ivan Lendl in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Becker was impressed by the new Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a tough player," Becker said. "He all the time comes back, he never 
really gives up and that's his best point." 
</P>
<P>
For Krickstein, it was an impressive performance, despite the result. He 
delivered this message -- even 22-year-olds make comebacks. Krickstein found 
something ironic about all this. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have finished college this year, if I had stayed in school," he said. 
"So I could have just played my first U.S. Open and a lot of guys would be 
saying, 'This guy is going to be good,' and I wouldn't have to deal with 
everything else I've gone through." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to edit five or so years from his career, Krickstein saw his ranking 
plummet to No. 64. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's back up to No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, who plays his first-round match tonight in the Volvo/Los Angeles 
tournament at the L.A. Tennis Center at UCLA, has also regained his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"You ride the Open for a while, with what happened, it's good for your 
confidence," Krickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
It was an unexpected ride. Although it was at the Open that 16-year-old Aaron 
Krickstein reached the fourth round in 1983, few believed his chances this time 
around were cast in anything other than plaster of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Team Krickstein turned out in force. His mother and father, from 
Grosse Point, Mich., cheered him on, as did his three sisters and a number of 
relatives from New York. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Krickstein, a doctor and pathologist at Detroit's St. John's Hospital, was 
elated at the progress his son has made in his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
When things were going bad, it was important to diagnose and treat all of 
Aaron's ailing parts, the elder Krickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not just the physical, which was obvious," he said, "but also the mental part 
of Aaron, which was just as important. 
</P>
<P>
"Injuries happen to all athletes, it's how you deal with it, how the people 
around you support you and believe in you that makes the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein has been injury-free, for him, since taking on that taxi. 
</P>
<P>
He won the New South Wales Open at Sydney, Australia, beating Andrei Cherkasov 
of the Soviet Union in the final, and reached the fourth round at the 
Australian Open before losing to John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
In that match, he popped a tendon in his elbow, missed three tournaments, then 
lost back-to-back in the first round when he returned. 
</P>
<P>
At least he knew how to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to start all over again psychologically," Krickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
When Krickstein won at Tel Aviv in 1983, he became the youngest to win a Grand 
Prix title. Krickstein was 16 years and two months old, and the new, young 
American hope. 
</P>
<P>
Then with all the injuries, Krickstein found himself supplanted by such new, 
young American hopes as Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Jim Courier, Pete Sampras 
and Jay Berger. 
</P>
<P>
A Davis Cup teammate of John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Peter Fleming in 1985, 
Krickstein told Arthur Ashe he couldn't play because of his sore foot that was 
soon diagnosed as a stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein was No. 7 in the world at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I never got to enjoy being on top," he said. "Chang and Agassi, they got to 
play and win tournaments when they were up." 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein was amused when Berger's name was brought up. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a couple of months older than I am," Krickstein said. "What am I? Chopped 
liver?" 
</P>
<P>
No, just fractured foot. But that's all over now, isn't it? The Krickstein 
comeback is still incomplete, although it does seem to be looking a lot more 
encouraging lately. 
</P>
<P>
A young veteran with a knee brace and a headband hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a weird situation because I'm in my sixth year, but I haven't 
really played six years because of injuries," Krickstein said. "Hopefully, I 
won't get injured anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Christo van Rensburg, the only seeded player who played at UCLA Monday, lost 
his first-round match, 1-6, 7-5, 6-1, to Darren Cahill. Van Rensburg led, 5-2, 
15-40, then proceeded to blow four match points. He led, 5-3, 30-0, and 
double-faulted three times. He double-faulted twice more in his next service 
game. "They just didn't want to go in," said Van Rensburg, who was seeded 
seventh. Said Cahill: "I was lucky. It was just one of those things. I'll 
probably never do it again." Cahill, coming back from an ankle injury, lost in 
the first round of the U.S. Open, his only other match since Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Pugh, who lost to Wally Masur in a five-set first-round match at the U.S. 
Open, lost his opening match to wild-card Slobodan Zivojinovic as another 
tiebreaker decided the final set: 6-2, 2-6 7-6 (7-0). "I hope I don't have too 
many more matches like that," Pugh said. Pugh and Rick Leach, Australian Open 
champions, are seeded second in the doubles behind Wimbledon winners John 
Fitzgerald and Anders Jarryd. The doubles draw is extremely deep and also 
features Patrick McEnroe and Mark Woodforde, Kevin Curren and David Pate, Jim 
Courier and Pete Sampras, Pieter Aldrich and Danie Visser, and Paul Annacone 
and Van Rensburg. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg was one of a select few who attended Ivan Lendl's wedding Friday 
at Lendl's estate in Greenwich, Conn. Lendl wed longtime companion Samantha 
Frankel. Van Rensburg, who went to the ceremony with girlfriend Monica Reinach, 
said print and television reporters were not allowed at Lendl's wedding. "They 
wanted to keep it small and quiet, but I can tell you that the bride and groom 
looked very happy," Van Rensburg said. The Lendls are in Europe on their 
honeymoon.

TAC CHALLENGED TEST, OVERTURNED THE RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the confusing world of drugs and drug testing, Bob Bowman of The Athletics 
Congress would like to believe U.S. officials are doing what is right. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Bowman and his colleagues on TAC's National Board of Review 
earlier this year overturned positive results by pole vaulter Billy Olson and 
shotputter Augie Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday night with The Times, Bowman said that two TAC appeals 
panels in separate rulings decided the athletes did not conclusively test 
positive for testosterone at the indoor national championships last February in 
New York. The test results were overturned and neither athlete was punished. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden, the chairman of the medical commission of the 
International Amateur Athletics Federation, testified at a Canadian commission 
investigating drug use by athletes that the TAC failed to report the positives, 
the New York Times reported in today's editions. Although Ljungqvist did not 
name the athletes, he claimed they tested positive at the UCLA laboratory, 
which is run by Dr. Don Catlin. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered what happened to the reports," Ljungqvist testified. "What seems to 
happen is that that panel takes the final decision and, in my view, this is not 
correct procedure, and I am not afraid of saying so." 
</P>
<P>
What happened, Bowman said from Oakland, was that the officials were not 
convinced that the athletes had unacceptable levels of testosterone in their 
systems. Bowman said he was a member of the committee that overturned Wolf's 
positive. Bowman and an unidentified TAC official who sat on the other panel 
confirmed Olson's case. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence presented did not indicate a violation," said Bowman, a member of 
TAC's board of directors. "It's one thing if it's an unnatural steroid (a 
derivative of the male sex hormone testosterone), quite another thing if it's 
testosterone. Everyone has testosterone in their system. Was it an unnatural 
level? Those levels had not been determined scientifically as far as we are 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee made testosterone a banned substance in 
1983, and first tested for the hormone at the 1984 Olympics. Still, accurate 
testing for testosterone has been disputed. 
</P>
<P>
Central to the dispute is whether a normal amount of testosterone produced 
naturally by the body can be determined. Medical science concluded at the time 
that the normal person should have a one-to-one ratio in the body of 
testosterone to epitestosterone, a biologically inactive steroid found in the 
testes and ovaries. But persons, particularly athletes, are known to have 
higher levels of testosterone to epitestosterone. 
</P>
<P>
According to IOC rules, which were later adopted by the IAAF, the world 
governing body of track and field, a person will be disqualified only if he is 
found to have a six-to-one ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone. Some 
athletes argued in 1983 that their bodies may naturally have produced that 
level of testosterone and that they may be disqualified even if they never have 
taken an injection of the substance. 
</P>
<P>
That concerned was echoed by Bowman and the other TAC official who asked not to 
be identified. They said the IAAF also is concerned with the system in effect. 
Bowman said revisions are being considered by IAAF officials because recent 
research indicates that the six-to-one ratio may not be valid. 
</P>
<P>
"Research has shown that some normal people may have a 75-to-one ratio," Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said that in the case of Wolf and Olson the levels were close to the 
six-to-one ratio. He and the other official said committee members agreed the 
results were not conclusive beyond reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"These athletes were tested negative many, many times," Bowman said. "We were 
looking for a trend. One positive test in a string of negatives is important to 
take into account. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have a fair hearing when the athletes test positive. We need to 
protect integrity of process on both sides. We're venturing into whole new area 
that's going to require more homework and more expense. We're learning as we 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Olson, one of the United States' best pole vaulters and a member of the 1988 
Olympic team, finished second at the indoor nationals with a vault of 18 feet 8 
1/4 inches. Wolf was second in the shot with a put of 67-2 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Neither could be reached for comment Monday night.

Former Dodger Steve Sax, now of the New York Yankees, told Alan Steinberg of 
Inside Sports: "I know the image of the Dodgers is associated with L.A. and 
Hollywood, but that's not me at all. I'm not L.A., that's not my style. Hugh 
Hefner invited me to the Playboy Mansion, and I was invited to Bob Hope's 
house. I never went. I had a crossword puzzle to do that night." 
</P>
<P>
Former Yankee Willie Randolph, now with the Dodgers, told Steinberg: "When I 
first came up they had all of those veterans -- (Thurman) Munson, (Reggie) 
Jackson, (Chris) Chambliss, (Roy) White -- so I just sat back observing. But I 
was always pumped up and vocal in the dugout. The media just didn't report it. 
With them, I was no-nonsense. I was preparing myself to play, so I only talked 
baseball. If you wanted to talk crap and jive, I didn't respond. So right away, 
'Willie's dull. Willie's moody.' Wrong, wrong, wrong.' "

Tunnel vision: Philadelphia Phillie pitcher Ken Howell knew he was in trouble 
when he left the locker room and entered the tunnel to the field at Veterans 
Stadium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was coming down the tunnel and people were saying, 'Hey, you're supposed to 
be pitching,' " Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies were scheduled to play a single game at 1:05 p.m., but a rainout 
Saturday night prompted officials to schedule a doubleheader Sunday starting at 
12:05. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have called to make sure of the time," Howell said. "It was a 
misunderstanding on my part." 
</P>
<P>
Don Carman pitched in Howell's place and got no decision in a 9-5 Philadelphia 
victory. Howell pitched and lost the second game, and his record dropped to 
11-12. 
</P>
<P>
On this date: On Sept. 19, 1973, the Angels' Frank Robinson hit his first home 
run in Arlington Stadium. It was the 32nd major league ballpark in which he had 
homered.

Trivia time: Greg Bell of the Rams was far and away the National Football 
Conference's top non-kicking scorer, with 108 points to 72 for the Chicago 
Bears' Neal Anderson. Who led the AFC? 
</P>
<P>
The naked truth? Stan Hochman of the Philadelphia Daily News, comparing the 
Mike Tyson saga to the fable of the emperor's new clothes: "His nakedness is in 
his atrocious manners, his excessive behavior, his flimsy conscience. Spare me 
the alibi that he is only 23, that he grew up in Brownsville's numbing poverty, 
in a busted home, that he is unprepared for the piranha that is fame and the 
fishbowl in which it swims. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, a lot of the ruffians he prowled with are in jail or in cemeteries. Not 
all. Some others are in society's mainstream, good and productive citizens. 
Tyson talks freely about the gun he carried, the feeble strangers he mugged and 
robbed. 
</P>
<P>
"Is he confessing with pride? With shame? Or is he pandering to America's 
bloodlust, selling tickets to a carnival sideshow featuring controlled 
savagery?"

LODISH REMEMBERS WOLVERINES; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA LINEMAN HAS HOME BRAGGING RIGHTS IN MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing up in Birmingham, Mich., near Ann Arbor, Mike Lodish was pressured 
extensively to play for the Michigan Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
But he never regretted enrolling at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to UCLA and Michigan and I came out West for some reasons I don't 
want to discuss," said Lodish, a 6-foot-3, 260-pound senior defensive tackle. 
"I enjoyed the (UCLA) coaching staff, the way I was treated and I wanted to get 
away from home and grow up a little bit and not have the comfort of being only 
45 minutes from home." 
</P>
<P>
Lodish said it wasn't easy to resist a personality such as Michigan Coach Bo 
Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him as a gut-tough, hard-nosed coach," Lodish said. "When I was 
being recruited, there were five high school All-Americans coming out of 
Michigan, and Michigan State got four of them. There was always the pressure on 
me that you're a Michigan boy and have to play here, that you're a 
Michigan-type person. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bo Schembechler came into your house, he demanded your attention. It was 
almost like it was his house, basically. He's kind of like a Woody Hayes-type 
coach. But I felt UCLA was the school for me." 
</P>
<P>
When Lodish eventually told Schembechler and his offensive coordinator, Gary 
Moeller, that he was going to UCLA, they asked him to delay his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"When I called Bo and told him I was going to UCLA, he went nuts a little bit," 
Lodish said. "He said, 'I'm coming to your house. You stay home.' So he and 
Gary Moeller came to my house. Who knows? Maybe I should have gone to Michigan. 
They were really on me to go to Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if UCLA Coach Terry Donahue is concerned about his Bruins 
having enough intensity this weekend against the Wolverines, he need not worry 
about Lodish, who has an agenda of his own. He has some bragging rights at home 
to attend to. 
</P>
<P>
And he wouldn't mind playing Michigan again this season . . . in the Rose Bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he could only take some satisfaction in Michigan's 22-14 Rose Bowl 
victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I was jumping for joy," he said. "Whenever anyone plays USC, I want USC to 
lose. It made me sick losing to USC because I came out here to play in the Rose 
Bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
Lodish said that he was mentioned on Schembechler's television show as a player 
who slipped away from Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what he thinks of me as a football player and that doesn't 
matter, but I'm sure he knows who I am," Lodish said, "and their offense is 
going to know who I am." 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA lineman recalls past recruiting days when Moeller and Schembechler 
tried to persuade him that he was going 3,000 miles away from home and wouldn't 
play because the California boys would be playing. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a challenge itself," Lodish said. "They were trying to beat 'Go Blue' 
into my head, but it really wasn't working. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt that UCLA would be a better school for me outside of football, 
getting contacts in business." 
</P>
<P>
Lodish said he became interested in UCLA when the Bruins beat the Wolverines, 
24-14, in the 1983 Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that hit by (defensive back) Don Rogers on (quarterback) Steve 
Smith in the Rose Bowl game. I thought this program is for real, that defense 
is for real." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lodish is emotionally ready for Saturday night's game, he is aware, of 
course, that Michigan is a formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to play our best to beat them," he said. "They're an 
excellent football team. They've got a tremendous attack and, being from 
Michigan, I know how Bo Schembechler is. They lost (last week) and Bo 
Schembechler doesn't like to lose, especially at home when he knows he could 
have won. They'll be pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, so will Lodish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UCLA Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said his team improved some in a 28-25 victory over 
San Diego State Saturday night, adding: "Obviously, we have a long, long way to 
go to become a good football team and improve. We have an opportunity to take a 
big step this week when we play Michigan. But you have to be blind to not 
realize what kind of football team they have." . . . Donahue also noted in a 
Michigan press release that Coach Bo Schembechler wants to improve his team's 
running game, which was shut down to some extent by Notre Dame. "I don't think 
you can win in football with passing alone," Schembechler said. "And no matter 
how well we pass the ball, that's not going to satisfy me until we will be able 
to punch holes in the defense and run." . . . Said Donahue: "I think he meant 
that for us. I take it personally." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin injury report: Nose tackle Jon Pryor (broken thumb), tailback Shawn Wills 
(sprained ankle), wide receiver Laurence Burkley (dislocated knee), defensive 
back Eric Nelson (torn knee ligaments) and tailback Ricky Davis (broken thumb). 
They're reportedly out of the Michigan game. "I don't think Wills will play, 
but he thinks he will and, if the player thinks so, he usually does," Donahue 
said. As for Pryor, a starter, Donahue says he may be out for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that quarterback Bret Johnson had a creditable game against San 
Diego State. "His greatest asset is that he is extremely competitive," Donahue 
said. "If every member of our team was as competitive, we would have a great 
team. He thrives on games." . . . UCLA is off to a shaky start, losing to 
Tennessee, 24-6, and coming from behind to beat San Diego State, a team that 
wasn't supposed to be in UCLA's class. Said Donahue: "Michigan is one of the 
top teams in the country. It's an opportunity for our team to step forward and 
show our colors." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler announced in Ann Arbor that freshman Elvis Grbac will be the 
Wolverines' starting quarterback this week. Senior starter Michael Taylor 
bruised his back last Saturday in Michigan's 24-19 loss to Notre Dame. Grbac 
replaced him in the third quarter and completed 17 of 21 passes for 134 yards 
and two touchdowns. . . . Fullback Jarrod Bunch also will miss the UCLA game 
after injuring a knee against Notre Dame. His replacement will be Leroy Hoard, 
who was the most valuable player last January in Michigan's 22-14 Rose Bowl 
victory over USC. Hoard, who ran for 142 yards and two touchdowns against USC, 
alternated at tailback last week with Tony Boles. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Dingman, a 6-2, 292-pound offensive guard, lost 30 pounds in the week 
before the Notre Dame game because of strep throat, Schembechler said, and is 
questionable for this week. . . . Gulam Khan, who had two kickoffs returned for 
touchdowns by Notre Dame's Raghib Ismail, broke an arm when hit by a blocker 
during Ismail's fourth-quarter runback.

YANKEES, METS SHOULD CONSIDER TRADING RIGHETTI AND STRAWBERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK O'CONNELL, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is time for the Yankees and Mets to consider moving two longtime New York 
fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Righetti and Darryl Strawberry have been marquee attractions and remain 
marketable. Their value would likely improve in other markets. Talking about 
trading Righetti may be considered heresy in the Bronx these days, at least in 
the front office now that George Steinbrenner is on a loyalty kick. The 
principal owner extended Bucky Dent's contract and is surrounding the boy 
manager with favored Yankees figures of the past, including pitching coach Mark 
Connor, who recently resigned as the University of Tennessee's baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti, the senior Yankee in terms of consecutive service, is a Steinbrenner 
favorite, but the reliever is also the only Yankee booed more regularly at the 
Stadium than Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Fans no longer view Rags as a legitimate closer. With nine blown saves in 32 
opportunities, Righetti has done little to alter that view. Last Wednesday 
night in Anaheim, Calif., his fastball did not hit 85 mph on the gun, which may 
explain why the California Angels' Brian Downing hit it so hard and so far. Had 
it occurred at the Stadium, Righetti would have never heard the end of it. 
</P>
<P>
In another setting, perhaps St. Louis or Kansas City, where he could share the 
closer job with a Todd Worrell or a Jeff Montgomery, Righetti might return to 
the form that once produced 46 saves. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals and Royals have expressed interest in Righetti, and the Yankees 
would be wise to keep listening if they could get a starting pitcher in return. 
</P>
<P>
With the San Diego Padres' Mark Davis possibly available as a free agent and 
the Cincinnati Reds' John Franco likely available in a trade, the Yankees might 
have an easier time replacing a No. 1 relief pitcher than obtaining a 
front-line starter without offering Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry has simply worn out his welcome in New York. With the possible 
exception of the Cleveland Indians' Joe Carter, no player in baseball needs a 
change of scenery more than Strawberry, who has little regard for the Apple. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry is still young enough (27) that fears his skills are eroding are 
unwarranted. In a less hectic setting, the brooding right fielder may have the 
monster year he has long promised. Even his average season before '89 (.266, 31 
home runs, 92 RBI) would satisfy many a club. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets learned this year exceptional starting pitching alone may be 
insufficient to win a division title. They have many holes and could use 
Strawberry as bait to fill them. The time is now. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Fay Vincent is commissioner, Steinbrenner may have to tone down his 
act. Vincent is a lifelong Yankees fan and graduate of Williams College, 
Steinbrenner's alma mater. How the Yankees handle their affairs, which in this 
decade has been laughable, will surely be an important concern to the new man 
on Park Avenue. A. Bartlett Giamatti was said to be disturbed by Yankees 
doings, or undoings, and he was a Boston Red Sox fan. Red Sox fans love it when 
the Yankees go crazy. Imagine how much more annoyed a Yankees fan like Vincent 
will become if the Yankees keep up their counter-productive behavior. ... The 
major fallout from the Frank Viola and Juan Samuel trades, otherwise smart ones 
for the Mets, was the surrendering of Rick Aguilera and Roger McDowell left 
them with has-been Don Aase and never-was Jeff Innis as right-handed closers. 
They have combined to go 1-6 with two saves and a 3.76 ERA and have together 
yielded three of the seven game-winning home runs the bullpen has given up. 
Randy Myers has allowed the other four, but at least he has a 6-4 record, 23 
saves and a 2.05 ERA. If the Mets are going to challenge next year, they must 
find or develop a comparable companion for Myers. 
</P>
<P>
It was generally thought the Cardinals took a big risk last year by trading a 
proven winning pitcher in John Tudor to the Dodgers for Pedro Guerrero, whose 
offensive talents were offset by poor defensive play and a tendency to keep a 
summer home on the disabled list. So what happens? Tudor spends most of the 
season on the DL while Guerrero makes enough noise to challenge the San 
Francisco Giants' Kevin Mitchell and Will Clark and the Mets' Howard Johnson 
for Most Valuable Player. Guerrero has fit perfectly into the cleanup-RBI role 
previously filled by Jack Clark and George Hendrick that is so essential for 
Cardinals success. They rely on their rabbits to get on base but need a hitter 
in the middle to move them around. Guerrero has batted better than .300, driven 
in more than 100 runs and been better than adequate at first base. He has only 
one error since July 18 and had a 53-game errorless string ended this past 
week. If the Cardinals can overtake the Chicago Cubs, Guerrero might overtake 
the other candidates for MVP. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Indians have won a newcomer's first game the past six times 
they've changed managers during a season. The Tribe's 1-0 victory over the 
Detroit Tigers last Tuesday for John Hart put him on the list with predecessor 
Doc Edwards (1987) as well as Pat Corrales ('83), Dave Garcia ('79), Jeff 
Torborg ('77) and Johnny Lipon ('71). The last Indians manager who took over in 
midseason not to win his first game was George Strickland in 1966. ... Bud 
Black became the first Indian in eight years to post successive shutouts. John 
Denny had three straight in 1981. ... Mitch Williams has more saves in one 
season with the Cubs than in his three previous seasons with the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Among Don Mattingly's natural gifts, which include smoking line drives and 
playing first base with stylish efficiency, is a knack for impressions. 
Mattingly is more Marcel Marceau than Rich Little. Pantomime is his forte. One 
of Mattingly's best is Jack Clark, accentuating the former Yankee's habit of 
dropping his bat and helmet at the plate and walking away with a look of 
disgust after striking out. Clark, who went to the Padres last winter, left a 
vivid impression on Mattingly, not the least of which was how to handle the 
role of designated hitter. "It never appealed to me much, but after watching 
Jack last year, I can see myself doing that a few years down the road," 
Mattingly said. "It doesn't make sense now because I'm needed at first base, 
but eventually I'd like to do it. It'd be great to come to the park and not 
have to worry about anything but hitting. I could add a few years to my career 
and take a lot of pressure off my back."

The Italian and Spanish basketball leagues are working on an agreement aimed at 
holding down salaries Americans get for playing in Europe, an Italian league 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Gianni De Michelis, Italy's foreign minister and chairman of the Italian 
league, said the "non-aggression" pact would help keep the price tag for 
American players "within reasonable limits." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ferry of Duke, the Clippers' No. 1 pick and the second 2 choice overall 
in the NBA draft in June, and Brian Shaw, who turned down an offer to stay with 
the Boston Celtics, signed million-dollar contracts with Il Messaggero of the 
Italian league earlier this summer.

<P>
SOUTHERN SECTION GETS THE JUMP ON CITY

<P>
Who has the best football teams in the area, the Southern Section or the City? 
</P>
<P>
The question is always open to debate at the end of the season because the two 
sides have never reached an agreement to have a local prep championship game. 
</P>
<P>
However, Southern Section and City teams do play during the regular season and, 
based on last weekend's results, the Southern Section has a clear advantage. 
</P>
<P>
In seven inter-sectional games, the Southern Section won five, including 
victories over two of the Times' top-ranked City teams, Carson, the defending 
City 4-A Division champions, and San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its early showing against Southern Section teams, many City coaches say 
they are at a disadvantage in game preparation. This season, City teams were 
not allowed to begin practices until Sept. 5. The Southern Section began Aug. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that there is any difference between the top teams in each 
section," said Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle, whose Colts lost to Bishop Amat, 
24-23, last Friday night at La Puente. It was the second consecutive year 
Carson lost the matchup. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Southern Section teams) have twice as many practices to begin the season 
and then they usually have one game under their belts because they begin their 
season a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to hurry our preparation in order to play a Southern Section team. It 
is impossible to have everything installed in time. You always would like to 
bring in a kid slowly, but because of the quality schools we play, we have to 
take risks." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez agrees with Vollnogle. 
</P>
<P>
"The top five teams in both sections are basically the same," said Hernandez, 
whose Tigers lost to Fontana, The Times' top-ranked Southern Section team, 
35-9, last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just not ready to play a team like that to start the season. They had 
already played a game and also had a couple of weeks more to practice than us." 
</P>
<P>
The only City teams to defeat Southern Section teams last weekend were 
Wilmington Banning, which defeated Long Beach Poly, 21-9, in both teams' first 
game of the season, and Crenshaw, which defeated Lynwood, 35-22. 
</P>
<P>
"High school is high school and we feel that we play the best teams anyway," 
said Crenshaw Coach Robert Garrett, whose Cougars are in the Pacific League 
with City powers Carson, Banning and Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an advantage in playing a game before us, but to us, it is just 
another ballgame because we cannot face any tougher competition than we do in 
the league." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat vs. Carson II -- Last season, Carson finished 12-1, with its only 
loss coming against Bishop Amat in its second game of the season. This year, 
Carson rallied from a 17-0 halftime deficit to take a 23-17 lead in the fourth 
quarter. However, Bishop Amat came back on Zack Zertuche's 23-yard touchdown 
pass to Jason Patterson, capping an 89-yard drive with 2:13 left to close the 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like Carson thought the game started at 9 instead of 7:30," Bishop Amat 
Coach Mark Paredes said of the Colts' comeback. "When we were up 17-0, the kids 
settled a little too much. We were fortunate that they did not have an extra 
minute to score late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
A key factor was Bishop Amat's ability to shut down Carson's running game, 
which accounted for only six yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I never, ever remember Carson having a night like that rushing," Vollnogle 
said. "We have a very inexperienced offensive line, but they just completely 
stopped us." 
</P>
<P>
Carson instead went to the air with first-year starting quarterback Armin 
Youngblood throwing for 314 yards and three touchdowns after a shaky first 
half. Carson receivers were led by senior Michael Ross, who had six catches for 
95 yards and two touchdowns. Senior Tydus Winans caught three for 99, and 
junior Latario Rachal had three for 72. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Parades reviewed the two-year Southern Section vs. City rivalry with 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"In all fairness, the City and Southern Section should start at the same time," 
said Paredes, whose Lancers averted their first 0-2 start since 1966. "But, 
last year we played Carson under basically equal circumstances and I thought 
that they were a little better this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gene (Vollnogle) says that they needed a couple more days to practice, we 
would have been in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
In Crenshaw's 35-22 victory over Lynwood, the Cougars amassed a school record 
in total offense with 498 yards. Senior tailback Kevin Hicks led the way, 
gaining 196 yards in 10 carries and scoring two touchdowns, including a 70-yard 
run. Senior fullback/linebacker Charles Jenkins also had a big game, gaining 78 
yards in 7 carries and scoring a touchdown on a fumble recovery. Lynwood, which 
played without injured star quarterback Charles Levy, was sacked 10 times by 
the Cougars' defense, with linebacker Shawn Lowery accounting for four and 
Jenkins two. . . . Levy said he will play in Lynwood's game against Carson 
Friday night at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. . . . Ivan Wilson of South Gate, 
City 3-A Division Player of the Year last season, gained 200 yards in 16 
carries in the Rams' 35-12 win over Los Angeles Wilson 
</P>
<P>
Kahill McAlpin of Los Angeles Loyola rushed for 104 yards and 2 touchdowns in 
the Cubs' 35-14 win over Long Beach Jordan. . . . For the second consecutive 
week, Paramount junior running back Leon Neal outshined star quarterback Jack 
Manu, rushing for 121 yards in six carries in the Pirates' 34-6 victory over 
Anaheim Katella. . . . In Los Altos' 40-7 victory over Crescenta Valley, the 
Falcons' only score came on a Southern Section record-tying 99-yard touchdown 
pass play from Aaron Erickson to Ryan Kadletz. For Los Altos, junior 
quarterback Mike Allen completed 18 of 29 passes for 277 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Senior fullback/linebacker Bobby Sylvester of Fontana gained 181 yards and 
scored two touchdowns in the Steelers' 35-9 win over San Fernando. Dana Riddle 
of Rancho Alamitos rushed for 317 yards on 37 carries in the Vaqueros' 9-6 
victory over Costa Mesa. . . . In Los Alamitos' 45-28 victory over Anaheim 
Servite last Thursday night, running back Erik Mitchell gained 245 yards in 20 
carries and scored three touchdowns for the Griffins, while Servite senior 
quarterback Rob Walker, playing in only his second varsity game, passed for 371 
yards.

KINGS LOSE TO PENGUINS BEFORE 17,385

RICHFIELD, Ohio

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just an exhibition game between the Kings and the Pittsburgh Penguins, 
but it was still a matchup of Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and it drew 
17,385 to the Richfield Coliseum Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux recorded an assist on every goal as the Penguins beat the Kings, 3-1. 
It was the Kings' first defeat in the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had the assist on the Kings' only goal, passing the puck back to Steve 
Duchesne, who was trailing on a breakaway. Duchesne's goal at 4:39 of the first 
period beat Tom Barrasso and gave the Kings a brief lead. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie goalie Robb Stauber, who decided in June to skip his senior year at the 
University of Minnesota to sign with the Kings, played the entire game Monday 
night. He made some impressive saves and had little chance at any of the shots 
that beat him -- Bob Errey's rebound of a Lemieux shot in the first period, Dan 
Quinn's tip of a centering pass by Lemieux on the power play in the second 
period, and Jimmy Johnson's shot after a Lemieux pass as Johnson stood at point 
blank-range.

</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will take a 1-1-1 record into their game against the Quebec Nordiques 
Wednesday night in Denver. The game will be televised live at 6 p.m. on Prime 
Ticket. . . . Tickets for the Kings' regular-season games went on sale at 10 
a.m. at the Forum, and by noon all the tickets that had been made available had 
been sold out for all four games of the opening home stand, both games against 
Montreal, all games against Calgary and the game against Philadelphia. . . .

NEW CHIEF OF PACIFIC SOUTHWEST HOPES TO FIND STRENGTH IN DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Southwest Corp. is a quirky little concern with an eclectic variety of 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
It owns 384 acres of largely undeveloped land in northern San Diego County; it 
counts kiwi farms, beehives and industrial sewing machines among its assets; it 
services commercial and residential mortgage loans and leases cars and 
computers, and it picks, packs and stores crops from farms owned by others. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge-based company, founded in 1980 by President Jerry Fraschilla, 
has always been a bit short on a long-term game plan, which helps explain its 
detours into unusual businesses. "When I originally started, it was not with a 
preconceived idea," Fraschilla said. "It just sort of evolved." 
</P>
<P>
And the company just sort of drifted into obscurity. Although Pacific Southwest 
has been consistently profitable -- it earned $123,402 on $1.9 million in sales 
for the nine months that ended April 30 -- its stock has all but been ignored 
by institutional investors. The stock trades on the so-called "pink sheets" 
over-the-counter market, which lists small, thinly traded stocks that don't 
attract much attention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Same Magic 
</P>
<P>
But William Hutchinson, president of Hutchinson Securities, a San Francisco 
investment banking firm, recently bought a 1% stake in Pacific Southwest and 
was elected to the firm's board of directors. Hutchinson is betting that 
Pacific Southwest's newest asset -- its chairman, Ronald Langley, 45 -- will be 
able to work the same kind of magic for the tiny company that he did while 
working for New Zealand's second-largest company, Brierley Investments. 
</P>
<P>
"With Ron Langley there, we'll have no difficulty in attracting additional 
capital for further expansion," Hutchinson said. By using Langley's contacts, 
Fraschilla said he is hoping to turn Pacific Southwest into a national 
financial services company. 
</P>
<P>
Langley is also wagering on his ability to turn Pacific Southwest into a 
success story. One of his first steps was investing $1 million to buy 333,333 
shares, or about 17% of Pacific Southwest's stock, and he received options to 
buy another 333,333 shares at $5 each. (Fraschilla and his family own about 24% 
of the company.) 
</P>
<P>
But building another success figures to be a lot tougher this time around for 
Langley. Brierley is a huge international concern with $7 billion in assets and 
access to virtually unlimited sources of capital, while Pacific Southwest's net 
worth, based on the difference between its assets and debt, is a mere $4 
million, with little extra cash for investments. 
</P>
<P>
Langley says the company could easily raise $2 million for investments or 
acquisitions with its existing cash and assets. But if Pacific Southwest's 
plans are big, that won't go too far. And raising money by selling more stock 
doesn't seem like an option given the company's meager appeal among large 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
What it all comes down to is that the pressure is on Langley to not only find 
crackerjack investments, but to also lure enough big partners to help share the 
risk of those investments. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these obstacles, Langley is bold enough to say that his plan is to 
attract a larger company that will buy into Pacific Southwest with a 
$10-million to $20-million investment and provide the resources necessary for a 
more significant expansion. The lure for such an investor will be his history 
of spotting profitable investments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting with a smaller size," Langley said. "But if we come up with an 
attractive enough investment, we can always get financing. Our equity portion 
might be smaller, but if it's good enough, there's always a way of making the 
investment work." 
</P>
<P>
Langley is already checking out investment opportunities to exploit in 
financial services, particularly since the savings and loan crisis has left 
many insolvent thrifts ready to dump assets such as mortgage operations and 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Fast 
</P>
<P>
Peter Brook, an analyst at the New Zealand brokerage Hendry Hay McIntosh Ltd., 
said he expects Langley to move fast. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference is he won't have the capital base to work with initially 
and the deals will be smaller," Brook said. "You'll see him buy perhaps some 
unusual companies that might not look like much, but he'll be able to do 
something with them." 
</P>
<P>
This faith in Langley stems from his track record when he worked for Sir Ronald 
Brierley, who was chairman of Brierley Investments until a recent change of 
control. Brierley isn't a big name to most Americans, but he's a big-time 
investor who became an international figure by investing in companies in 
Australia, Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving here from his native Australia in 1984, Langley served as 
executive director of Industrial Equity Pacific Ltd., Brierley's North American 
investment group. And Langley followed Brierley's investment style, which 
involves looking for undervalued businesses, no matter how offbeat or eclectic 
they might be. 
</P>
<P>
"Langley was very much a Brierley's man," said Michael Willis, an analyst at 
James Capel &amp; Co., a London brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1-Billion Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
In those five years, Langley built Industrial Equity's portfolio of U.S. 
investments from $2 million to about $1 billion. Langley bought Everest &amp; 
Jennings, the Los Angeles wheelchair manufacturer; bought and sold Higbee Co., 
a Cleveland department store chain, and at one time owned a stake in Calmat 
Co., a Los Angeles cement maker, and Resorts International, the Atlantic City 
gambling and hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
Langley claims Higbee as his biggest coup. Higbee was foundering through a 
depressed local economy in 1984 when Langley started buying stock. "The broker 
I first gave the order to thought that I was a bit of a madman" because the 
firm was in such bad shape, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Langley saw a talented retail team and valuable underlying assets at 
Higbee, such as real estate that would eventually bounce back from the slump. 
Brierley acquired the company for $72 million and sold it three years later for 
$165 million. 
</P>
<P>
After spending 14 years amassing investments for someone else, Langley wanted 
to do it for himself. "I was looking to have more equity in what I did next," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
That next step became Pacific Southwest. Actually, Fraschilla initially 
approached Langley and tried to get Industrial Equity to make a $10-million 
investment in Pacific Southwest. The deal never materialized, but Fraschilla 
and Langley hit it off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boost in Net Worth 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Langley quit his post with Brierley to become chairman at 
Pacific Southwest. Langley's $1-million investment helped boost the firm's net 
worth to at least $4 million, the minimum required for the company's stock to 
be listed on the higher profile National Assn. of Securities Dealers National 
Market list. Having its stock traded on NASDAQ might eventually help Pacific 
Southwest sell more stock to raise money for its expansion. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Langley and Fraschilla hope that the encroaching development 
from San Diego and Orange counties will soon catch up to the firm's land 
holdings near Escondido and Ramona, giving them the opportunity to profit from 
land sales or to take part in developments. That might not happen soon, though, 
since zoning changes in northern San Diego County are often tough to come by. 
</P>
<P>
"Just having the land alone won't guarantee the next step," said Hugh Sinnock, 
head of the San Diego office of W. Ross Campbell, a mortgage banking company. 
"But if it's in the direction of growth, it's just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
The company's other operations remain small and exist largely to generate 
income so Pacific Southwest can afford to hang onto the land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retired in 1973 
</P>
<P>
Fraschilla, 52, retired as Technicolor's vice president of corporate 
development in 1973 and got into the real estate business. He opened Pacific 
Southwest in 1980 and two years later started a mortgage brokerage business to 
avoid paying fees on land he bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the mortgage business, which collects fees on loans originated by 
lending institutions, expects to handle about $180 million in residential 
mortgages and up to $60 million in commercial loans, including those processed 
through mortgage businesses in the Bay Area and Santa Ana that Pacific 
Southwest recently agreed to acquire. Those loans would produce between $1.5 
million and $3 million in pretax income, Fraschilla said. 
</P>
<P>
The company also leases such equipment as cars, computers, sewing machines and 
medical equipment, and it remains in various agricultural businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Langley said he plans to stay in all those businesses and expand them as 
quickly as possible while searching out opportunities such as Higbee that would 
interest other investors and give Pacific Southwest the chance to buy assets on 
the cheap. 
</P>
<P>
All of his grand plans, of course, turn on whether he can come up with the 
money to pay for these ventures. "But I've always found in the past that if an 
idea is good enough, you'll always find someone with the money," Langley said. 
</P>
<P>
Stockholders in Pacific Southwest can only wish him good hunting.

AUDIOTAPE FIRM FIGHTS SUIT OVER BEST SELLER; 
</P>
<P>
'LONESOME DOVE' RIGHTS AT HEART OF DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last spring, Dove Books on Tape, a Studio City-based company that produces 
audiocassette tapes of books, began selling the audio version of the 
best-selling novel "Lonesome Dove," which also was an Emmy-winning television 
miniseries earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The tape seemed poised to be another in a string of audio hits to be produced 
by Dove, which, despite relatively small annual sales of about $5 million, has 
become one of the leading books-on-tape companies since its founding four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Dove has temporarily lost "Lonesome Dove." Shortly after Dove began 
shipping the tapes, the company was sued in federal court in Los Angeles by 
publishing giant Simon &amp; Schuster, which has been publishing the Larry 
McMurtry novel since its debut in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Paramount Communications and itself a major 
producer of books on tape, claims it also owns the sole audio rights to the 
book and that Dove was producing the tape illegally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restraining Order 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster quickly got a temporary restraining order blocking Dove's 
sale of the tapes, after about 5,000 copies -- which retailed for $14.95 each 
-- had been shipped. And late last month, it won a preliminary injunction that 
keeps Dove from selling "Lonesome Dove" pending a trial. No trial date has been 
set. 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster also is suing Qintex Entertainment, which produced the TV 
miniseries and which licensed Dove to make the audio version based on the 
screenplay and sound track of the TV show. Much of the conversation on the 
audiotape, such as words spoken by the miniseries' star, Robert Duvall, is 
taken directly from the show. 
</P>
<P>
Dove and Qintex, which is part of the Qintex Group of Australia that has agreed 
to buy MGM/UA Communications, deny any wrongdoing. They contend that when 
Qintex obtained the TV rights to the book, it also was granted specific rights 
to adaptations -- including audio -- of its screenplay and miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
But Elizabeth McNamara, a Simon &amp; Schuster lawyer, said that "the 
screenplay is an adaptation of the book" and that her company controls "any 
adaptation" of the book. The company's suit seeks a permanent halt to Dove's 
production of the "Lonesome Dove" audiotape and an as yet unspecified amount of 
monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
Dove's production of the "Lonesome Dove" audiocassette came to Simon &amp; 
Schuster's attention when a photograph appeared in the Times in March. The 
picture, accompanying a story of Dove and its founder, Michael Viner, showed 
actor Bruce Boxleitner reading some parts of the audio version of "Lonesome 
Dove" for Dove's tape. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Countersuits Filed 
</P>
<P>
Dove and Qintex, meanwhile, each have filed countersuits against Simon &amp; 
Schuster, with each seeking $10 million in damages. Simon &amp; Schuster has 
asked the court to dismiss both countersuits. 
</P>
<P>
Dove's suit alleges that Simon &amp; Schuster contacted booksellers and warned 
them that if they kept selling Dove's "Lonesome Dove" tape, they could be 
subject to contempt of court, said Dove lawyer Jessica Kaye. Dove is suing 
Simon &amp; Schuster "for the damage they did to our relationship with the 
booksellers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex, among other things, is asking the court in its countersuit to declare 
that if Simon &amp; Schuster's claim to any adaptation of the book is upheld, 
that it "does not prevent us from releasing a videocassette version of the 
miniseries," said Louis Petrich, a lawyer for Qintex.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: COMMITTEE OF HCC BOARD RETAINS BEAR, STEARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HCC Industries of Encino announced that a committee of its board of directors 
retained Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. to help it consider a leveraged buyout offer 
worth about $10.5 million made by a group of top HCC executives in August. 
</P>
<P>
The management group, led by HCC Chief Executive Andrew Goldfarb, bid about 
$8.50 per share for the stock it does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
A number of public stockholders then filed suit in Court of Chancery in 
Delaware to block the bid. The suit maintained that the bidding managers and 
other HCC officials, including Chairman Jack Goldfarb, had breached their duty 
to stockholders and that the price offered was "grossly inadequate."

RESEARCH RATES SPERMICIDES ON BATTLING DISEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most widely used spermicide may not offer the best protection against 
sexually transmitted diseases. Instead, new research data concludes, the active 
ingredient in only one contraceptive jelly marketed in the United States and 
another chemical not in any American product were the most effective in tests 
against diseases such as herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA research identifies octoxynol-9, the chemical used in Ortho-Gynol 
Contraceptive Jelly, and benzalkonium chloride, used in Europe but not here, as 
superior to the most common ingredient, nonoxynol-9, that is present in such 
products as Gynol II, Ortho-Creme and the Today contraceptive sponge. 
</P>
<P>
"On balance," the study concluded, "it would appear that octoxynol is the 
spermicide most effective." 
</P>
<P>
The Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., the largest manufacturer of spermicides, said 
it could not respond to the UCLA findings because its choice of ingredients was 
based entirely on contraceptive effectiveness. Ortho said its product line 
includes both octoxynol-9 and nonoxynol-9 to offer consumers a choice in the 
event one ingredient or the other causes side effects. 
</P>
<P>
The spermicide test results, which knowledgeable scientists said would be 
highly controversial, may pose a problem in fashioning a large-scale 
AIDS-prevention campaign. Like condoms, spermicides have never been certified 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for anything but pregnancy prevention. 
Yet in a variety of public and consumer-oriented forums, Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop and other public health officials have urged use of condoms and 
spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 as an AIDS-prevention technique. Now the 
UCLA-sponsored tests introduce the possibility that it is not the most 
effective agent for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The report on spermicides was included among hundreds of pages of a federally 
funded condom research project headquartered at UCLA. The spermicide testing 
was conducted in 1987, but the report wasn't written until earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The results, which had not been publicly released because of a variety of 
political and scientific intrigues, were obtained by The Times last week under 
the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Spermicide Study 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA researchers initially ordered a study of spermicide effectiveness 
against the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases as part of a 
plan for a large human trial of condoms to assess their true ability to prevent 
AIDS. The study sought to identify the most effective condoms and spermicides 
on the market so such products could be distributed to research subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was terminated, however, when the federal government's National 
Institute on Child Health and Human Development withdrew financial support for 
the project. The institute concluded that such a large-scale human test would 
be too dangerous to its subjects because the high concentrations of AIDS cases 
in Southern California, where the research would have been done, would have 
made the chances of contracting the disease dangerously high if a condom 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
In an especially controversial finding, the UCLA-sponsored research found that 
octoxynol-9 alone is also capable of killing the Epstein-Barr virus, linked to 
the mysterious disease associated with chronic fatigue and other symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
In their report to the government, UCLA researchers also disclosed that 
laboratory notebooks containing one of two sets of AIDS test data had been 
mysteriously lost by a laboratory technician working on the study as a UCLA 
subcontractor. The loss of the data means that the HIV results "should be 
interpreted with caution," the report concluded. But the report also said a 
duplicate set of the data had been retained. And the researchers emphasized 
that the findings on gonorrhea and chlamydia are at odds with reports by other 
scientific teams, requiring further verification. But the results for other 
sexually transmitted diseases, the research report noted, were less open to 
question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Conclusion 
</P>
<P>
Despite the questions about spermicides and the AIDS virus, the report 
concluded that if the canceled human trial had been held, "the choice of 
octoxynol as the spermicide . . . would appear obvious: It is effective against 
the most agents and it is already FDA-approved." 
</P>
<P>
However, the report also noted there may be "some user opposition" to 
octoxynol. Scientists familiar with spermicide research said there are 
tentative and highly controversial studies that suggest the use of octoxynol is 
associated with an increase in birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers questioned by The Times, who agreed to comment on the condition 
they would not be named because they did not want to be drawn into a political 
or legal controversy, called the birth defect findings preliminary and possibly 
incorrect. Ortho has mounted vigorous legal defenses for octoxynol's safety. 
</P>
<P>
Benzalkonium, the researchers concluded, would be a good second choice, but the 
FDA said no American product is authorized to use the chemical widely employed 
in France and Switzerland. A U.S. drug company, which the researchers did not 
identify, is believed to be testing benzalkonium for use in a contraceptive 
sponge.

DISAPPEARING ACTS;

<P>
AUTHOR JONATHAN COLEMAN DRAWS A BEAD ON WHY PEOPLE CHOKED BY THEIR LIVES SIMPLY 
DECIDE TO DROP OUT OF SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In fiction and our fantasies, we run away to sea, the circus and the Foreign 
Legion. Or build a raft to ride the Mississippi and just go somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, stifled and stressed modern man opts for anonymity in more prosaic 
surrounds -- a community college in El Paso, a computer company in Houston -- 
usually settling for much less than they left. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, says Jonathan Coleman, author of "Exit the Rainmaker," a new book on 
one man's disappearance from his thoroughly successful and completely 
conventional life, the grass is no greener on the other side of our dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he added, as society, careers and relationships continue to squeeze, we 
continue to fancy some clean and healing escape from what Henry David Thoreau 
described as the mass of men who "lead lives of quiet desperation." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman sees the stay-leave dilemma in himself and in all of us: "At the very 
least, we want everything to go on hold for a while because there is this 
feeling that we're heading down a path in a way that we never, ever intended 
when we were 18 and dreaming of what life would be like." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Male Factor 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't think it is a phenomenon restricted to men: "It's a myth that it is 
only a male factor. Women take off but they often come back because of 
children. There is a sense that women are more anchored than men in our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
He suspects adults skipping to new starts forms the majority of current 
National Crime Information Center statistics that list 60,000 regular Americans 
as absent without logical explanation. And those are only the reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman certainly subscribes to estimates of Charles Sutherland, head of Search 
Inc., a private missing persons bureau in New Jersey, who believes the total of 
adult Americans chucking it all for a period, or permanently, to be closer to 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Histories 
</P>
<P>
It is nothing new. In 1930, New York Superior Court Judge Joseph Crater left 
his chambers and told an assistant: "Don't forget to turn out the lights, 
Johnson." He hasn't been seen since, said Coleman, and could well have 
disappeared for a better, anonymous life. 
</P>
<P>
Agatha Christie took off for a while and the late mystery writer's quick exit 
remains something of a mystery. Gauguin left his wife and family for Tahiti. In 
1926, at the height of her Bible-thumping visibility, salvationist Aimee Semple 
McPherson was believed drowned while swimming near Venice Beach and showed up 
five weeks later in a town on the Arizona-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
The extensions are endless. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, Ed Greer, 33, a successful and rising engineer with Hughes 
Aircraft Co. of El Segundo, left work and never came back. He was discovered 
this year in Houston working under an assumed name for a computer software 
company. 
</P>
<P>
His wife has remarried and has denied his request to visit with their two sons, 
now 9 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might Be Back for Lunch 
</P>
<P>
And seven years ago, Julian Nance (Jay) Carsey, the 47-year-old president of 
Charles County Community College, Md., married the owner of a 23-room Georgian 
house close to hunt country, left home and told his wife he might be back for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't show. 
</P>
<P>
But he did cancel a dental appointment, withdrew $28,000 from a joint bank 
account, drove here and mailed five farewell letters and one postcard to family 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Carsey, still using his own name, eventually surfaced in West Texas where 
he has remarried and is a program director at El Paso Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Carsey did not flee to avoid criminal prosecution. There were no financial 
difficulties at home or at the college. He had community authority, status, 
respect, a secure job, a fine home and a stunning wife. There was no other 
woman involved. 
</P>
<P>
But in subsequent interviews, Carsey said: "I felt as if I was dying inside. I 
didn't know whether (wife) Nancy was driving me harder or I was driving myself 
against some concept of what I should be, or both. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I wanted to do something else with my life and I didn't want to go 
through the wrenching session I would have if I had left in a conventional way. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not going to talk to anybody about what I was planning because it was a 
very clean-cut decision in my mind, a perfect decision, actually. I did what I 
wanted to do the only way I, Julian Nance Carsey, could see of getting it 
done." 
</P>
<P>
So Julian Nance Carsey was outta here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turning Into a Sleuth 
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by newspaper reports of Carsey's disappearance, Jonathan Coleman -- a 
book editor turned broadcast journalist turned author and English teacher at 
the University of Virginia -- began investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's primary curiosity has always been for human behavior, particularly 
the clouded, complex motivations behind all that we do. 
</P>
<P>
That obsession was displayed in Coleman's 1985 book, "At Mother's Request," 
about a Utah woman who persuaded her teen-age son to murder her father. It 
shows in his admiration for the depth of human study displayed by Truman 
Capote's "In Cold Blood" and Robert Lindsey's "The Falcon and the Snowman." In 
Carsey, he believed, the analysis would be more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"After hours of talking with him, I realized there are a lot of people like 
Carsey," he said. "Because his is a story about expectations and dreams and 
what happens when you achieve them and they turn out not to be what you thought 
they would be." 
</P>
<P>
So he has written a vehicle by which to measure ourselves? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely. I think the book is a very threatening book. I think what people 
least like doing is being introspective because that is very painful." 
</P>
<P>
Through months of interviews that took him from Greece to West Texas, from 
endless talks with Carsey, his former wife and some 150 friends and business 
and college associates, Coleman, 37, traced one man's anguish to its beginning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child of the Depression 
</P>
<P>
Carsey was a child of the Depression who grew up in Bryan, Tex. Homer Carsey, 
his father, was trumpet player in a circus, a Linotype operator and tamed 
vagabond. Bea Carsey, his mother, was of higher graces, played bridge, sought 
status and placed her son on an enormous pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
Floating on those expectations, Carsey attended Texas A&amp;M, earned degrees 
in chemical engineering and business administration, and went to Washington. He 
drove a red Corvette, dated a campaign worker for John F. Kennedy, was a 
Polaris missile manager at the Naval Ordnance Station -- and tagged along 
behind carefully selected dates to Washington's social functions. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Carsey was on his way. 
</P>
<P>
At 30, he had earned a doctorate in public administration from George 
Washington University and was president of Charles County Community College. He 
had married Nancy and her social status. Their mansion, "Green's Inheritance," 
was stuffed with enough souvenirs from world vacations that it was known 
locally as Smithsonian South. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Carsey, clearly, had it made. 
</P>
<P>
Then he dropped it and became a drop-out husband. 
</P>
<P>
The post card he mailed to close colleague John Sine, the college dean who 
would succeed him as president, contained a single message: "Exit the 
Rainmaker. Good luck. Jay." 
</P>
<P>
It was a reference to N. Richard Nash's "The Rainmaker," the venerable play 
that tells of an itinerant who charms a dusty community into believing he can 
create rain. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually deserts the community and the woman who loved him. Sine once 
directed Carsey in a local production of the "The Rainmaker." And so Carsey 
wrote his farewell that became the title of his biography. 
</P>
<P>
Early reviews of "Exit the Rainmaker" have ranged from adulation to 
first-degree murder. USA Today called the book "riveting." New York magazine 
brutalized it for "ridiculous, trite analogies." The Washington Post talked of 
Coleman's work as "a glamorous mystery (that) ends with two irredeemably 
shallow sociopaths (the Carseys) squabbling over the division of goods." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing Person Resurfaces 
</P>
<P>
After he resurfaced some months after leaving Maryland, Carsey and his wife 
began a year of long, complex legal wrangling that eventually resulted in 
divorce and disposition of their joint property. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, added the review, "What the book in fact has to tell is the story of a 
long and rancorous divorce case, spiced briefly by the disappearance of one of 
the principals. Mystery dispelled. What 'Exit the Rainmaker' finally 
illuminates is how utterly banal the act of desertion is." 
</P>
<P>
To Coleman -- interviewed here at the start of a national book promotion tour 
that Thursday sees him in Los Angeles -- dismissal of his book as overpadding a 
simple domestic dispute is the reflection of a reviewer skipping the multiple 
directions and nuances of his analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I have made a mountain out of a molehill," he said. "This (book) 
isn't about a guy who walked out on his wife. This is a book about a guy who 
walked out on his whole life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Examines Base Meaning 
</P>
<P>
His attempt, said Coleman, was to get beneath the myth of success and examine 
its base meaning. His fascination was Carsey's transition from early years of 
searching for material and social gain, the standard currency of America, to 
his final years in Maryland when "all he wanted to do was go home and be by 
himself and watch 'Monday Night Football.' " 
</P>
<P>
Coleman says he can see many areas of common ground between Carsey and Ed 
Greer, California's most recent disappearing act. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there was a similarity that both realized that it was not wise to be 
good at something you didn't like," Coleman continued. "Because then you might 
find yourself doing it for the rest of your life. 
</P>
<P>
"The other (similarity) is that, having spoken to Kit Clark (Greer's former 
wife, now living in Northern California) I know that Greer was a 
non-confrontational person and, just like Carsey, did not reveal much of 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
The author believes he knows Carsey better than Coleman knows himself. He sees 
a man once cowed by his mother's shrill anger, who married a woman whose temper 
was equally intimidating. Coleman believes Carsey was pushed into seeking 
personal achievement by his mother's elevated expectations. When, all the 
while, his true character leaned more toward that of his restless father. 
</P>
<P>
Nor could he be straightforward, "preferring to circle the building a few times 
before entering . . . and he's a great one for answering a question with a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"Anomie," Coleman continued. "That's what Carsey believes is the root of what 
he has done." Or as Carsey explained to the author in a partial denial of the 
first reference of anomie: "Total rootlessness. That what you're dealing with 
as much as anything. 
</P>
<P>
"As I've said before," Carsey said, "I have no sense of links. It's funny, but 
I used to be slightly suspicious when I would look at someone's resume and see 
14 jobs in 14 years. Now I understand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Self-Analysis 
</P>
<P>
In a later self-analysis, said Coleman, Carsey referred to a passage in Walter 
Lippmann's "A Preface to Morals." He said it spoke for him. Coleman thinks it 
may speak for many men in today's frantic crush of marriage and career and the 
telescoping of satisfactions. 
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of (modern man's discontent) there are likely to be moments of 
blank misgiving in which he finds that the civilization of which he is a part 
leaves a dusty taste in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may be very busy with many things, but he discovers one day that he is no 
longer sure they are worth doing." 
</P>
<P>
 It is suggested to Coleman that a person simply might resign formally from the 
job, call an attorney, organize a divorce settlement and seek a new life and 
spouse in freedom and with peer approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I understand why Carsey did what he did," Coleman said. "For one 
thing, he would have been awfully susceptible to other people talking him out 
of it. He was weak in ways like that. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't tell his wife because he was afraid of Nancy in the same way he 
was afraid of his mother. He had seen her rage with him as he had seen his 
mother's rage with his sister and he was frightened by rage." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's book is no mystery story of tracking a man who doesn't want to be 
found. Neither is it a condoning, nor condemning the act of running away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Hurting Each Other' 
</P>
<P>
"It is a story about how people keep hurting each other from a distance . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is about getting into relationships for all the wrong reasons. He married 
her because she (Nancy Carsey) was polishing him, this shirttail-out, 
rough-hewn kid from Texas, on the way up. She married him because she saw 
somebody clearly going places . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is about how we do not have the desire to right wrongs because we're always 
trying to please. Carsey is a man who always looks for smiles because he is 
destroyed by frowns . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Although, Coleman agreed, there is a piece of all of us and all of some of us 
in Jay Carsey, his is not a path to be followed if children are involved in the 
marriage. Nor should it be a choice for those persons who do not have Carsey's 
flair "for landing on his feet . . . things always turn up for Julian Nance 
Carsey." 
</P>
<P>
But for this one man it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really sympathetic to what he did. I wished he could have done it 
differently. But I can't blame Carsey for trying to save himself. Rightly or 
wrongly, he was going down fast. 
</P>
<P>
Yet returning to his roots, by remarrying, by settling for less money, 
attention and position than he had, has Carsey indeed saved himself? Is he 
happier now than then? 
</P>
<P>
"What he didn't have and what he never had in Nancy was being loved for who he 
is," Coleman said. "He was loved for what he represented, his status, money, 
all the accouterments. 
</P>
<P>
"Dawn (his current wife) loves him for what he is. Warts and all. And that is 
the pivotal point in the book." 
</P>
<P>
Exit the marriage maker.

TOM HERNANDEZ TOOK A LOT OF FLAK AS MAN BEHIND 'LIBERATOR'S' GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a long, hard day's work, sitting there, watching and waiting. It was a 
tense and apprehensive time, sometimes even frightening. 
</P>
<P>
The plexiglass cover of the turret provided almost no protection, the metal of 
the fuselage not much more, and the flak jacket was too bulky and heavy to wear 
and still get the job done. So Tom Hernandez sat on it. 
</P>
<P>
No, just about the only safeguards a man had if he was a tail gunner on a 
bomber in World War II were his marksmanship and the many manifestations of 
Providence, usually referred to as luck -- or Luck. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, of Clairemont, spent his combat time in The War in the tail gunner's 
perilous slot on a B-24 Liberator, and so he knows firsthand the difficulties 
and the terrors and the occasional exhilarations of that chancy assignment. 
</P>
<P>
And, although machine-gunners did not enjoy the glory of pilots, especially not 
that of fighter pilots, they too had their moments of exaltation. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Tom Hernandez, for instance, performed his tasks so well that he 
twice won the Distinguished Flying Cross, and he won the Air Medal with four 
Oak Leaf Clusters. 
</P>
<P>
He shot down at least two Messerschmitt 109's, Germany's top fighter plane, and 
he helped land a crippled bomber. He participated in the first American raid on 
Berlin, and he was among the first to report that Germany was using jet 
fighters. But mainly, as far as he is concerned, he survived. He completed 35 
missions and returned home unscathed physically and unscarred mentally. 
</P>
<P>
To Hernandez, 64, a retired San Diego city employee, those singular airborne 
moments of more than four decades past are almost as vivid and endless today as 
when he lived them. Hear him tell of his first mission: 
</P>
<P>
"There I was, 18 years old, flying over there for the first time. They brief 
you on what to expect, and I was waiting to give it a try. I wasn't really 
scared -- at that time. I was apprehensive, wanting to see what it's all about. 
As it turned out, it was one of our toughest missions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The date was Feb. 24, 1944. Hernandez belonged to the 409th Squadron of the 
93rd Bombardment Group, a unit of Gen. James H. Doolittle's 8th Air Force. 
Hernandez's B-24 took off from its English air base at Hardwick, part of a 
group of 235 Liberators assigned to bomb the aircraft factory at Gotha, in the 
southwestern sector of eastern Germany. The odds then against completing 15 
missions were 30-1, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
"The two worst formations you could fly were lead or tail because they got hit 
first (by enemy aircraft). You wanted to stay in formation. It was safer and 
gave you more firepower. We were in the lead group. We caught hell. I really 
don't know why we didn't get shot down. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, it was estimated that the Luftwaffe had 7,000 front-line fighter 
planes. On D-Day, they had around 50. We took a lot of hits, but no one got 
hurt. We got three kills, and I got one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It flabbergasted you. All of a sudden it's wartime. Real war. The flak is bad 
enough. You had to fly through some heavy stuff. You could hear the shrapnel 
coming through the plane. But when you see a fighter flying toward you, when 
you see little red spots (tracer bullets), you'd better start firing back. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
According to Martin Bowman in his book "B-24 Liberator 1939-45," Hernandez and 
the other airmen were under persistent attack from 150 German fighters "all the 
way to the target." At first, the American bombers were aided by U.S. pilots in 
P-47 fighters, later by P-38s and P-51s. But losses were heavy. 
</P>
<P>
"In one six-minute period," Bowman wrote, "five Liberators went down." 
</P>
<P>
Dropping their bombs from 12,200 feet, the Liberators destroyed the Gotha 
plant. The 8th Air Force estimated that production would be lost for six weeks 
to seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Hernandez shot down his first Messerschmitt. 
</P>
<P>
"We were attacked just before the target," he said. "I was so excited, you just 
have to react to do what you're trained to do. Keep your eyes open. You fire 
and fire and hope you get one. A lot of it is a matter of luck. 
</P>
<P>
"You're firing like hell, hoping you get him and he doesn't get you. Sometimes, 
if they see you firing they'll stay off. Most came in at 12 o'clock high, just 
like the movie. . . . This one bunch came in . . . trying to break up the 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
"I started shooting at 75-100 yards, and he started smoking. He rolled over on 
his back, and I figured I'd hit him. Our waist gunner saw him go down in smoke, 
and this was also confirmed by a crewman in our wing plane." 
</P>
<P>
And did he feel like he had killed a man or merely shot down a mechanical 
contrivance that was attempting to destroy him? 
</P>
<P>
"I just shot down a plane. You really don't think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Was he happy? 
</P>
<P>
"In a way I was, afterward. It's what you're up there for. You don't bask in 
your glory. You don't know if you're going to get back." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez had "a few more shots" on the way back to Hardwick, and the nose 
gunner destroyed one fighter. Upon landing, congratulations were in order. 
</P>
<P>
"The trip was unbelievable. After a mission, it's a pretty somber group. Such a 
long day, from dawn to dusk, in the aircraft 7-10 hours. Tension. Every 
movement is tiring. Probably the pilots suffered most. A lot of them cracked up 
mentally. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen a lot of films. On the first mission, everything happened just like 
in the movies, and it was like that from then on. . . . (When you return) you 
look around to see who got back and who didn't. We took quite a few hits, flak 
and bullets." 
</P>
<P>
The tail gunner in a B-24 sat between twin rudders at the end of the fuselage. 
He manned twin .50-caliber machine guns, air-cooled in a hydraulically 
controlled turret. He operated the turret by pressing one button, fired the 
guns by pressing another. The machine guns were smokeless, "but you could smell 
them a little." Plus: "There was a lot of noise." 
</P>
<P>
A gunner had only three to five seconds to decide whether to fire, once an 
enemy aircraft was lined up, Hernandez said, and only two or three seconds of 
firing time during a pass by a fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all very, very quick," he said. "As soon as you see those little blinkers 
(tracers fired at you), you know they're getting in range." 
</P>
<P>
Not that any facet of a bombing raid was pleasant, but life in the tail was 
certainly difficult and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, you felt trapped. You're isolated. You only had your intercom. Once 
after some action I couldn't get anyone. I panicked. It scared the hell out of 
me. I got out and saw a waist gunner. Somehow, it (the intercom) just wasn't 
working. 
</P>
<P>
"You're all alone. It's that you don't know what's happening. It's 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he preferred being tail gunner to operating the nose gun, an 
assignment he found "scary." On one mission or another, he manned the nose gun, 
the top turret and a waist gun on this craft that carried a crew of 10 men. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important raids he participated in was the first U.S. attack on 
Berlin. It occurred on March 6, 1944, and was Hernandez's fifth mission. 
Weather was good. Spirits were high. 
</P>
<P>
"All the boys figured Hitler was close by. Everyone felt great. It was what 
we'd been waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he could see "everything" happening, "like the little red lights 
shooting at you." 
</P>
<P>
"There were many air battles. It was like a big movie house. All the way in and 
out you could see." 
</P>
<P>
He shot down his second ME-109 on that raid. 
</P>
<P>
"We had dropped our bombs and were on the way when they hit us again. The 
German plane came right at me from the tail. I gave him a couple of bursts from 
a thousand yards or less. I must have hit him just right. His left wing came 
apart. He flipped over and headed down." 
</P>
<P>
Even with two prestigious enemy fighter planes destroyed on only five missions, 
Hernandez had seen enough not to feel like the baseball rookie who hits a home 
run his first time at bat in the majors and feels, "I always knew I could hit 
in this league." 
</P>
<P>
"There was not an opportunity to fire on every mission. Sometimes you see 'em 
(enemy fighters) all over, but they don't attack your part of the formation. 
You could pretty well tell from your position in the formation if you would be 
attacked. And we had our fighters, too." 
</P>
<P>
Was there a grand feeling of relief when his part of the formation was not 
attacked? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Still, when his group was targeted, it was often difficult to know who shot 
down what. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, you have 30 guns shooting at one fighter. It's hard to tell." At 
least once he felt he had destroyed a third German fighter, but no one else 
could confirm it, and so he did not receive credit. Nevertheless, he was the 
only gunner in his crew to destroy two fighters. The nose gunner and a waist 
gunner knocked down one each. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers help illustrate the difficulty of aerial gunnery. So do these: 
According to San Diegan Ray Wagner in his book "American Combat Planes," B-24s 
in the European Theater flew 226,775 sorties, losing 3,626 of their number 
while destroying 2,617 enemy aircraft. Hernandez' 93rd Bombardment Group in 
9,321 sorties lost 140 Liberators while destroying only 93 enemy planes, with 
41 probable kills and 44 damaged, according to "The B-24 Liberator" by Allan G. 
Blue. 
</P>
<P>
Some gunners shot down five or six enemy planes, Hernandez said, "But I don't 
think there were too many of them. It was a matter of luck in most 
circumstances. You're just trying to do your best and stay alive. Gunners and 
fighter pilots had to be good or lucky to do any damage." 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not think lack of recognition for aerial gunners was relevant. 
Such heroes as Air Force fighter aces Richard Bong, Hubert Zemke and Francis 
Gabreski, along with Audie Murphy of the infantry, were "extraordinary" and 
deserved all recognition they received, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, this B-24 crew, like other crews and units throughout the war 
theaters, was too busy fighting its own battles to consider jealousies of 
others. One such busy fight occurred on return from its 13th mission. 
</P>
<P>
In relentless fighter attacks, pilot Howard Kliener had been killed, one engine 
and one landing gear shot out and another engine rendered almost useless. 
Co-pilot John Fitzpatrick was at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
They approached the French coast at between 8,000 feet and 10,000 feet. 
Fitzpatrick told the crew to prepare to bail out. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the navigator where we were," Hernandez said. "He didn't know if we 
were over the English Channel or land. If we parachuted into the channel we'd 
freeze to death in 10 minutes. I talked to the pilot. He didn't know if we had 
enough fuel (to reach England), but he agreed to try. We dropped down into the 
clouds. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, 5 feet 6 inches tall, was instrumental in removing the dead pilot 
from his seat, then took the pilot's place and helped steady the crippled 
aircraft as they crossed the channel and tried for a mile-square emergency 
landing site, Hanso Air Force Base, near Dover. Hernandez had been permitted to 
help fly in the past and was familiar with the task. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit and skidded God-knows-how-long. We almost went into a ditch." 
</P>
<P>
Among his souvenirs is a photo of that Liberator, which was unnamed, its tail 
tilted high, about to slide into the ditch. Another is the Distinguished Flying 
Cross he was awarded for helping to remove the pilot's body and bring the 
others to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, he had to parachute after all. It happened four missions later, 
their 17th, after a raid on May 19, 1944, over Brunswick, near Berlin. They 
were in a different B-24, of course, one named Jungle Princess, inherited from 
another unit. Again, the aircraft was extensively damaged. And a 20mm cannon 
shell from a German fighter had torn through the fuselage behind the nose 
turret, killing the bombardier and wounding the navigator. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to return over the North Sea," Hernandez said. "The weather was bad and 
we were shot up again. Our base was 40 miles from the North Sea and the eastern 
coast of England." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick was the pilot now. When he determined they were over England, he 
turned the Liberator back toward the North Sea, and everyone bailed out from 
1,800 feet, a first for all. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no real panic. I got out the back hatch. It was a dark, cold rainy 
day. You could barely see the ground. I landed on my feet in a plowed field and 
fell over a couple of times. There was a farm house nearby, and they were able 
to call the air base." A Jeep was sent to retrieve the crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to bail out than to crash-land a plane. Once a B-24 is out of gas, 
it heads down. Those things don't glide, because of the narrow wing. I saw one 
(running out of fuel) nose in from 50 feet when it was in the landing pattern, 
2,000 feet from the runway. It wiped 'em out. So you took your chances and 
hoped you made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, in the third and last Liberator these crewmen would need, 
they returned to action -- a couple of young men named John, a James and a Jim, 
Dave and Delmar and Bill, and two guys named Joe, plus the youngest, usually 
called Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
And about the time they had completed 20 missions, thought they had survived 
the war and would soon be going home, except for the first pilot and the 
original bombardier, the Army extended them indefinitely. So they participated 
in the D-Day hammerings of the German gun emplacements on the Normandy coast, 
making two bombing runs at 12,000 feet, low for a Liberator. (The Army counted 
those two runs as one -- or miscounted -- and that is why Hernandez flew 35 
missions but was credited with 34.) 
</P>
<P>
A little later, heading for Hamburg on June 18, Hernandez became one of the 
first to report the presence of German jets. 
</P>
<P>
"They had briefed us on what they looked like," he said. "I saw a plane going 
across the sky with smoke coming out behind, and it was going faster than 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
When he was extended he was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"But things were going our way. Our groups were getting bigger and theirs were 
smaller. But one of the most dangerous missions was our last, over St. Lo." 
</P>
<P>
This was on July 25, carpet-bombing from 14,000 to 15,000 feet in an attack 
that permitted U.S. ground units to break through across France. 
</P>
<P>
"We were apprehensive at the end, because we wanted to get it over with. I took 
every precaution at the end." 
</P>
<P>
And that night they celebrated. Everyone received a Distinguished Flying Cross 
-- the second for Hernandez. As with most crews, this one had enjoyed 
camaraderie: "Sometimes we would go to the officers' compound and they'd let us 
drink some of their booze." 
</P>
<P>
Before the war, Hernandez lived for many years in that sector of Solana Beach 
known as Eden Gardens, where his aunt, Ramona Rincon, established the Blue Bird 
Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
At San Dieguito High School, he won varsity letters in football, basketball, 
softball, track and golf, and is especially proud of playing on the undefeated 
football team of 1940 and unbeaten golf team of 1941. The golfers played the 
county's major schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We all caddied at Rancho Santa Fe," Hernandez said. "That's where we learned 
to play. We all shot in the 70s. We were good for our time." 
</P>
<P>
On Easter Sunday of 1946, he married his longtime sweetheart, the former 
Catalina Brionez. They had four sons and a daughter. For 20 years he was a 
plumber in the building industry. For the next 20 he worked in the city's 
Buildings Division, retiring in November 1987 as plumbing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
He still plays golf. And he and Catalina take an occasional long vacation. Next 
summer they plan to visit England, including the air base he flew those 34 
missions from. Or 35. Then they want to see France and Germany -- from the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, from Wednesday through Sunday, Hernandez will attend a meeting of 
the International Liberator Club at the Holiday Inn at the Wharf. The gathering 
marks the 50th anniversary of the flight of the first Liberator, built in San 
Diego by Consolidated Aircraft Corp. and flown at San Diego on Dec. 29, 1939. 
It was the first of 18,481. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if any of the crew will be there," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
But he will be looking for them -- a couple of men named John, a James and a 
Jim, Dave and Delmar and Bill, and two guys named Joe. They, too, were good for 
their time.

<P>
AN AUSTERE 'FAITH HEALER' AT ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Odyssey Theatre opened Sunday night. There is work to be done on the 
building, but there was nothing unfinished about its first show, Brian Friel's 
"Faith Healer." 
</P>
<P>
The Odyssey's new address is 2055 S. Sepuleveda Blvd., north of Olympic 
Boulevard, an arc-lit industrial block where every second building is an 
auto-body shop. Brecht would have loved the neighborhood and the building too. 
Its shell is an empty warehouse that the city is letting Ron Sossi's company 
use for $1 a year. Where some theaters spend big bucks to achieve that 
exposed-pipe look, the new Odyssey was born to it. 
</P>
<P>
It also promises to be a more coherent structure than the old Odyssey, which 
was really a confederation of storefronts. Here, all three playing spaces will 
feed off the main lobby, as at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the spaces is ready at the moment, and it wasn't clear until 
Saturday that it would be ready. You would have forgiven the cast of "Faith 
Healer" for being a bit distracted Sunday night, but they were as precise as if 
they were doing laser-beam surgery. 
</P>
<P>
That's absolutely necessary in "Faith Healer." It's an austere piece, as 
intimate as chamber music, but without the interplay that is one of the 
pleasures of chamber music. Its three characters tell the same story, but they 
tell it separately, never appearing on the stage together. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do they act the story. What happened happened some time ago. What they are 
playing is the memory of what happened, and each has reason to remember the 
past differently. 
</P>
<P>
The listener has to look at all the stories and decide what really happened. 
It's also left to him to imagine what these three people were like when they 
were a team touring the village halls -- the faith healer (John Horn); his wife 
(she claims she was his wife -- Judy Geeson) and his impresario (Neil Hunt.) 
</P>
<P>
The story is as convoluted as the faith healer himself, and there is no doubt 
as to the fact that he was a devious man indeed. In fact he takes pride in it. 
Horn gets first crack at us, and within two minutes we are in the palm of his 
hand. The character has so many faces that he can't help changing them, and 
Horn refuses to make it easy for us by deciding which is the real one. 
</P>
<P>
Just as you decide that this is a cynic drowning in his own bile (an Archie 
Rice of the religion business), he'll say something amusing -- and be truly 
amused by it himself. At first you thought of Jamie in "A Moon for the 
Misbegotten." But as Horn went on, you also thought of Mephistopheles in "Dr. 
Faustus." The devil, they say, is a good host. 
</P>
<P>
Geeson is equally divided, but it's a more painful division, that of a woman 
whose hard-won calm can be shattered in a second by a random memory -- not even 
necessarily a painful one (though she has plenty of these as well). This is a 
woman fighting to command her past, a task as vain, sometimes, as telling the 
North Atlantic to be still. 
</P>
<P>
Then we hear from Hunt, as the impresario. We're looking for him to be an 
obsequious fellow, for that's how the other two remember him. In fact, he's 
breezy and not nearly as harrowed by the memory of what happened at the faith 
healer's last show as expected. 
</P>
<P>
But just as we accept that, changes start to happen here, too. This is not a 
play where much can be taken at face value -- the final surprise being the 
exaltation of Horn's last monologue: the exaltation of a devious man finding 
simplicity (a fatal simplicity) at last. 
</P>
<P>
Who is the faith healer? Only himself, probably. But there's a moment -- 
curiously, it's in Geeson's monologue -- when we can see him as a tortured 
version of Christ, a man with a "gift" that feels like a curse. 
</P>
<P>
The overtone may be accidental, but the dark side of the charismatic's life is 
surely one of the play's themes, and makes it particularly timely just now. We 
are not, however, dealing in the black-and-white terms of "Elmer Gantry" here. 
This play really is about the spiritual life. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Rowe directed the four monologues. With three actors this proficient, it 
was probably basically an editing job, but he has done it well -- though we 
never see the characters together, they are in the same play. Russell Pyle's 
set and lighting, and Ritchie M. Spencer's costumes, are also spare, but 
absolutely to the point -- Geeson's shapeless sweater, for instance, its 
pockets no longer giving her hands a real place to hide. "Faith Healer" gets 
the little things right, beyond which we see the big things. 
</P>

BITTER ISSUE OF WRITERS GUILD ELECTION IS STRIKE OF '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The grueling Hollywood writers' strike that virtually shut down TV and film 
production ended more than a year ago. But this month's campaign for the top 
posts at the Writers Guild of America, West is reviving the painful memories 
and internal dissent prompted by that five-month walkout, the longest in movie 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Winners in the current voting -- which ends Thursday -- will help chart the 
course for the guild's next round of negotiations with management in 1992. 
Those contract talks aren't expected to be any easier than previous 
negotiations in the 1980s, when increasingly intransigent producers sought and 
won rollbacks from Hollywood's creative unions. 
</P>
<P>
While Writers Guild elections typically are more spirited than other union 
contests in Hollywood, this year's race is especially rough. "It's pretty 
nasty," said incumbent president George Kirgo. Added one of his two opponents, 
Burt Prelutsky: "There seems to be hard feelings this time, a lot more dirty 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those hard feelings are a direct outgrowth of the strike. Prelutsky and 
his allies wanted the guild leadership to be tougher with management -- even if 
it meant a longer strike -- while presidential candidate L. Travis Clark was 
part of a coalition of dissident writers who threatened to cross picket lines 
to go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Kirgo falls squarely in the middle, defending his own performance as president 
during the strike, and that of executive director Brian Walton, the London-born 
lawyer who was hired to run the guild four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the guild view the election as a referendum on Walton, who was thrown 
into the limelight as the union's chief negotiator during the strike. Kirgo 
lists the future of Walton as one of the two most important issues facing the 
guild, right alongside the union's need to cope with the increasing 
globalization of film and TV production. 
</P>
<P>
"(Walton) is one of the most brilliant people I've ever met," said Kirgo. "For 
us to lose him would be a tragedy." Kirgo's allies hint strongly that Walton 
would leave if Prelutsky -- considered the most serious challenger to the 
incumbent -- won the election. 
</P>
<P>
Walton will say only that his contract runs through 1992, and he has "no plans 
to leave the guild earlier than that." 
</P>
<P>
Walton received a standing ovation when guild members met to ratify the strike 
settlement in August, 1988, but Kirgo's two opponents for president don't think 
he deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, (Walton) wound up being the hero," said Prelutsky, who has won awards 
for his TV movies and has written for such shows as "MASH," "Newhart" and 
"Family Ties." "But I don't think the strike was successful." 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the guild's board, Prelutsky cast what he calls a "symbolic" 
vote against the final strike settlement, and he continues to believe that the 
guild should have extracted more gains from management. 
</P>
<P>
Prelutsky has been critical of Walton and Kirgo for other reasons too. "Brian 
is sucking up too much power and George has been an accessory to that," said 
Prelutsky. During the strike, he insisted, "the board of directors was cut out 
of the loop." 
</P>
<P>
Walton disputes Prelutsky's claims, noting that board meetings during the 
strike averaged one per week and totaled more than 80 hours. "In addition, 
several board members were on the negotiating committee and the president 
(Kirgo) was at almost all the negotiations," he said. From the opposite end of 
the spectrum, Clark also chastises the guild's handling of the strike. A critic 
of contemporary union leadership in general, Clark said the guild's leaders 
should have tried harder to avert a strike by reaching an early accommodation 
with management. "The leaders were saying, 'We're going to bring this town to 
its knees.' But this is our community, our town," Clark said. "Negotiations 
should not start 30 days before a contract ends. (Guild leaders) should be 
keeping up contact with management. A strike should be a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
Clark also contends that neither Kirgo nor Walton has been accessible to the 
guild's membership during or since the strike. "My argument is not with 
management right now," Clark said, "it's with an elitist leadership that 
doesn't give its members access." 
</P>
<P>
Walton calls the charges of elitism "ludicrous." He said that between 1985, 
when he came to the guild, and 1988, he "personally met with 2,000 or more 
writers in small groups. . . . I came to the guild deeply concerned about 
making it a member-oriented service organization, and a very democratic one." 
</P>
<P>
Kirgo dismisses the accusation that he and Walton were inaccessible during the 
strike as "a joke. . . . I was on the phone day and night. I was never absent 
from a picket." As for Prelutsky's criticism of the settlement, Kirgo notes 
that in the final settlement, the union chocked up 33 gains over management's 
first offer. 
</P>
<P>
Though critical of Prelutsky, Kirgo saves his sharpest attack for Clark, saying 
his election would be a "travesty." "He's been a member of the guild for two 
years and he thinks he's ready to be president," Kirgo said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kirgo and Prelutsky attack Clark for his involvement last year with 21 
dissident writers who not only threatened to cross picket lines, but also asked 
the National Labor Relations Board to invalidate provisions of the union 
constitution preventing members from resigning and going back to work. 
</P>
<P>
"If he won, would he then quit the guild?" asked Prelutsky. 
</P>
<P>
"We never said we would resign," Clark responded. "We said that anyone who did 
want to (resign during a strike) should have the right to do so." The labor 
board later sided with the 21 dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how much support Clark, a former civil rights activist who 
co-created the TV show "Tour of Duty," can draw. Although the 21 dissidents 
attracted about 550 interested writers to an informational meeting last summer, 
many writers are still bitter about the group's threatened secession in the 
midst of a difficult strike. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has engaged in some mudslinging of his own. In a Sept. 5 letter, Clark, 
who is black, virtually accused the guild of racism when he claimed that a 
non-candidate opponent had gained privileged access to his candidate's 
statement. "I look forward to being reassured that my candidacy has not been 
trivialized in the manner to which African-American candidates have been 
accustomed in so many elections in this country," Clark wrote to the guild. 
</P>
<P>
(The non-candidate opponent, Brad Radnitz, had referred to Clark's statement in 
a written critique of Clark and others. But guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden 
said the candidate statements were made available to all guild members once 
they were submitted.) 
</P>
<P>
Even the secretary-treasurer race is not immune to these rough-and-tumble 
politics. Two allies of candidate Adam Rodman purchased an advertisement in 
Daily Variety contending that the election of one of his opponents, Oliver 
Crawford, "would be highly detrimental to the best interests of the guild." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Rodman said the advertisement was necessary because Crawford, 
a 25-year board member and a Prelutsky ally, is well-known among guild members. 
"Ollie is just unqualified," said Rodman, a Kirgo ally. "Everyone knows his 
name and they may associate that with competence." 
</P>
<P>
"I try to stay away from these scurrilous attacks," Crawford responded. "I 
don't think they belong in this organization." 
</P>
<P>
The third candidate for secretary-treasurer, David P. Lewis, has managed to 
stay out of this particular fray. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high emotions in this campaign, the election results will probably 
turn on a fraction of the guild's membership. According to Rhoden, no more than 
1,600 of the guild's nearly 6,500 eligible members ever vote in officer 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Writers Guild, insists Kirgo, came out of the strike with a reputation for 
strength and unity. The current campaign is "embarrassing," he said. "I'm just 
embarrassed by all this."

BOITO'S 'MEFISTOFELE' GOES TRENDY 
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's a poor opera company to do? What's a poor critic to do? 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the San Francisco Opera presented Alban Berg's "Lulu" in a lavish, 
thoughtful new production by Lotfi Mansouri. For the most part, it respected 
the composer's wishes. Your faithful scribe admired the tasteful result but 
complained, sotto voce, that it seemed just a bit too timid. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the same company introduced a new production of Boito's 
"Mefistofele." No one could accuse it of timidity. Robert Carsen, the latest 
Wunderkind director on the trendy international circuit, had second-guessed the 
composer in just about every area except the harmonic progressions. Your 
faithful scribe found the tasteless result a bit too daring. 
</P>
<P>
There must be a useful middle ground between rigid respect for convention and 
reckless insensitivity. San Francisco hasn't found it this season. 
</P>
<P>
Carsen and his designing accomplice, Michael Levine, haven't just staged 
"Mefistofele." They have raped the old romantic opera. 
</P>
<P>
They have done so with wild flights of imagination, with skill and guts. They 
have concocted a terrific show. It offers non-stop titillation, smothered with 
glitz. It takes pride in jolting perspectives and shocking sensibilities. 
Still, rape is rape. 
</P>
<P>
Boito, you may recall, wrote his lush, somewhat sentimental, ultimately 
poignant version of the Faust legend in 1868. It is Italianate in its primitive 
passions, sweeping in its grandeur, and far closer to Goethe's epic than the 
perfumed version of Charles Gounod. 
</P>
<P>
Boito thought big. He did not shrink from the philosophical confrontation 
between the elemental forces of good and evil. He created a serious portrait of 
a heroic devil who dares shake a cynical fist at a lofty deity. 
</P>
<P>
Carsen trivializes all that, makes fun of it, and introduces stylized comic 
distractions. He plays the entire drama on a ersatz-baroque stage within the 
stage. All the world's a theater. Life is make-believe. Get it? 
</P>
<P>
We got that message a long time ago. What else is new? 
</P>
<P>
Mefistofele, in this context, becomes a two-bit hocus-pocus villain. He climbs 
out of the orchestra pit on a ladder. He toys with a lot of magic props, 
changes costumes constantly, favors anything red, conjures up puffs of smoke, 
smiles and cackles. He hitches the unfortunate Faust to a flying contraption 
that would have been rejected by a bus-and-truck company Peter Pan. He looks 
like some suave imitation bad guy who wandered in from an Offenbach operetta. 
</P>
<P>
That's just the beginning. The phony boxes in the phony opera house behind the 
proscenium are haunted by mysterious masked figures in white shrouds and gold 
crowns. We think they represent a Greek chorus masquerading as a saintly 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Faust himself, a quizzical fellow in symbolic white tie and white 
tails. And his Margherita, a pleasant peasant bride who inhabits a not-so-merry 
merry-go-round that is decked with apple trees and cranked into rotation by a 
convenient crone. Helen of Troy becomes a statuesque diva and her court is 
turned into an audience of tuxedoed sugar daddies bearing floral tributes. 
</P>
<P>
Oops. Almost forgot the mock raunch. 
</P>
<P>
The motley crowd -- a very, very motley crowd -- at the kermesse includes a 
nearly naked Adam and Eve, plus a non-biblical pair of conspicuously copulating 
revelers. Many of the costumes reveal flesh in surprising places. The vision of 
Margherita is totally, literally, and not all that idealistically, denuded. The 
Walpurgisnacht choristers sport modern underwear, and less. The anachronistic 
outfits come equipped with prop genitalia. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes, quickly and lustily. Sight overpowers sound. Cutesy gags 
trample lyricism. Clever gimmicks distort honest emotion. It is fine, if one 
doesn't happen to care about the music. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the San Francisco forces do care. Maurizio Arena conducts with 
splendid breadth and, where possible, with canny point. The overburdened 
chorus, trained by Ian Robertson, pays equal attention to Arena's stick and 
Carsen's shtick. The cast is strong, for the most part, and it plays gamely 
with the directorial conceits. 
</P>
<P>
The center of attention must be Samuel Ramey. He sings the title role very 
well, in his somewhat monotonous way, and he makes a mighty noise -- mightier 
at the top, actually, than at the bottom. He seems to enjoy the hammy charades. 
He exudes obvious matinee-idol allure. He takes his shirt off -- a personal 
trademark, whatever the role -- with proud aplomb. It isn't his fault that he 
cannot make some of us forget Norman Treigle. 
</P>
<P>
As Faust, Dennis O'Neill sings with as much ardor and flexibility as his rather 
small and dry tenor allows, and he is good sport. It is worth pondering how 
Luciano Pavarotti might have reacted -- and looked -- if a director wanted to 
twirl him above the set on a wire. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriela Benakova, lirico spinto par excellence, mustered an eloquent 
Margherita and a sultry Elena, the hint of vocal indisposition notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The excellent supporting ensemble included Judith Christin as a giddy Marta, 
Emily Manhart as a mellifluous Pantalis, Daniel Harper as a befuddled Wagner 
and Douglas Wusnch as a staunch Nereo. The ballet provided a graceful Grecian 
divertissement under the direction of Alphonse Poulin, though the dancers 
didn't seem to appreciate the pervasive parody. 
</P>
<P>
The production, incidentally, came from Geneva and will end up in Chicago. The 
opening-night audience hailed it with generally hearty applause. 
</P>
<P>
Some boos greeted the director and designer, however, at their curtain call. 
Most of the disapproval seemed to emanate from the standing room. That area has 
always accommodated the most discerning patrons.

FRIENDS OF PHOTOGRAPHY MOVES INTO SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The funky old Friends of Photography has gone uptown. The 22-year-old 
association has abandoned its homely digs at the Sunset Cultural Center in 
Carmel and moved into a smartly refurbished building in downtown San Francisco. 
Called the Ansel Adams Center, in honor of the organization's most prominent 
founder, the Friends' new home opened to the public Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Seen last week -- while painters were still at work on the exterior and the 
building's sign had yet to be delivered -- the center seemed to have a lot 
going for it: 
</P>
<P>
The building is centrally located at 250 4th St., in the Yerba Buena/South of 
Market district -- across the street from the Moscone Convention Center, two 
blocks from the site of the new San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and within 
easy walking distance of Union Square. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends' attractive but unpretentious new home looks as though it will work 
well without a crushing overhead. The center's annual operating budget is about 
$1.6 million, almost half of which comes from membership dues and sales. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition program looks promising and the Friends' high-quality 
publications will continue. 
</P>
<P>
A loyal following of 10,000 members is likely to grow now that there is a 
proper showcase. All things considered, the Friends seem to have raised their 
profile with so much finesse, you wonder what took them so long. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing a city, for one thing. The group looked at Los Angeles, Monterey and 
Carmel, executive director Ron Egherman said, but finally settled on San 
Francisco because the city allowed them to reach a larger audience while 
staying in touch with the Bay Area's strong tradition of photography and the 
Friends' Carmel support base. San Francisco is also the birthplace of Ansel 
Adams and his home for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Raising money also took some time. Including a $250,000 gift from Eastman Kodak 
Co., the Friends raised $1.2 million during a capital campaign to pay for 
renovating the building. The finished 14,000-square-foot space, designed by the 
architectural firm of Robinson, Mills and Williams, consists of five exhibition 
galleries, a bookstore, a library and administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
Phase Two, yet to come, is to buy the building and fix up the basement for 
workshops and educational programs. Phase Three will renovate the second floor 
and possibly add a restaurant there, according to Ellen Manchester, director of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken about five years to realize the first phase of the project, but 
now the program is under way. The first visitors to walk through the doors will 
see four exhibitions: a large contemporary show, called "Nature and Culture: 
Conflict and Reconciliation in Recent Photography"; "Legacy: Northern 
California's Photographic Heritage," a concise historical survey; "Tracings of 
Light: Sir John Herschel and the Camera Lucida," featuring landscape drawings 
made with an optical drawing aid, and selections from the center's collection 
of Adams' work. 
</P>
<P>
The contemporary and historical mix of shows is typical of what the center will 
offer in a program of about 15 exhibitions a year. "We will represent 
photographic traditions along with works that don't even look like photographs. 
Diversity is the name of the game," Egherman said. The Ansel Adams Center will 
always have some of its namesake's work on view in one gallery, including the 
125 works that Adams gave to the Friends and loans from other collections. The 
Friends have not collected photography in the past, but the new building has 
attracted offers of gifts and the policy may be reconsidered, Egherman said. 
</P>
<P>
A more immediate task is to hire an exhibitions director to add to the staff of 
14. The schedule of future exhibitions has been planned by administrators, 
leaving some "holes" for the new chief to fill, Manchester said. Meanwhile, the 
lack of a permanent coordinator has given opportunities to guest curators. 
</P>
<P>
John Bloom, a San Francisco artist, photography historian and educator, has 
taken on the most ambitious task -- "Nature and Culture," the contemporary show 
that fills the main gallery and a smaller one. He has chosen extraordinarily 
interesting material -- about 80 pieces by 45 artists. Print by print, the 
works are so engrossing that they tend to obscure the fact that the exhibition 
is entirely too ambitious to be coherent. 
</P>
<P>
As Bloom notes in an introduction on the checklist, "Nature and culture embrace 
the breadth of experience." He narrows that vast field to four themes: recorded 
effects of scientific culture upon nature; personal or culturally conditioned 
responses to nature in constructed subject matter; images, language and text as 
the character of culture; and the reconciliation of nature and culture through 
mythic or ritualistic forms. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that scheme doesn't offer much help to the viewer trying to 
figure out what Larry Sultan and Mike Mandel's maquette for a billboard 
(picturing a puzzled observer, an Indian dancer and a box of white corn meal) 
has to do with, say, Catherine Wagner's investigations of science classrooms or 
Eileen Cowin's photograph of a woman watching television in elegant isolation. 
One of those themes would have been more than enough; four produces confusion. 
</P>
<P>
As the show settles into memory, the concept that rises to the surface is how 
culture encroaches upon nature. Human beings fill nature with radiation (Stuart 
Klipper's "Portents in the North: Radiation in Lapland"), burn it (Nic 
Nicosia's "Real Pictures" of kids idling watching the destruction of a tree), 
turn it into a commodity (Sultan's and Mandel's "White Corn Meal" billboard) or 
a specimen (Joel-Peter Witkin's weird stuffed rhinoceros). 
</P>
<P>
A subtext that also emerges quite clearly is that some artists -- notably Jo 
Ann Callis and John Divola -- deal with the death of nature by recreating it in 
their studios, where branches stand in for whole trees and electrically 
generated breezes have the force of a gale. 
</P>
<P>
"Nature and Culture" -- it's fertile territory in need of further exploration 
and a good deal of cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
Independent curator Debra Heimerdinger organized "Legacy," the historical 
overview of Northern Californians' contributions to photography. The survey 
runs from Carleton E. Watkins 1897 landscape, "Cape Horn, Columbia River," to 
Don Worth's recent, richly patterned still life blending a Matisse poster with 
a similarly painted background. The adventurous zeal of early explorers, the 
social conscience of Farm Security Administration photographers and the 
creativity of contemporary artists are represented in this compressed bit of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracings of Light," a fascinating curiosity from the Graham Nash collection, 
is a historical footnote to the celebration of photography's 150th birthday. 
The pictures are not photographs but drawings done with a viewing device, 
called a camera lucida, used in the 19th Century by gentlemen travelers. The 
"camera's" lens allowed the viewer to see a scene and drawing paper at the same 
time and to produce meticulous renderings of nature. 
</P>
<P>
Sir John Herschel, a colleague of William Henry Fox Talbot (one of the 
inventors of photography), did exactly that. Making grand tours of Europe in 
the best spirit of romanticism, he drew Roman aqueducts and ruins. At home, he 
recorded Stonehenge as well as English gardens and abbeys. The results are 
surprisingly lovely and varied in treatment -- from spare outlines to lushly 
worked landscapes. Despite their precision, the drawings provide ample evidence 
of an artist at work, one who made conscious decisions about such matters as 
light, contrast and composition. Larry Schaaf and Graham Howe selected the 
Herschel works. 
</P>
<P>
As for Adams' inaugural show, James and Mary Alinder did the honors. That's 
appropriate because he is the former director of the Friends and she worked for 
Adams for many years. The Alinders' choice of about 40 works is a fitting 
homage, including "Surf Sequences" from 1940 and classic shots of Yosemite, 
Kings Canyon and aspens. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Ansel Adams Center is part of a bicoastal photography museum 
boom that's taking place this fall and winter. The International Center of 
Photography in New York opened a new gallery in midtown Manhattan on Friday. 
The California Museum of Photography at UC Riverside was expected to open this 
month in a renovated building in downtown Riverside, but the construction of an 
earthquake-retarding framework has postponed the event until around the first 
of the year.

ACTORS WEARY OF TYPECASTING CREATE 'LATINS ANONYMOUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First there was Alcoholics Anonymous, then Gamblers Anonymous and Overeaters 
Anonymous. Now, at last, comes "Latins Anonymous," a show in which four Latin 
actors stand and come to terms with the fact that they are -- what else? -- 
Latin. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I realized I was Mexican," says Rick Najera in the opening 
scene, "was when I asked my mother if I could play with the Mexican kid down 
the block, and she told me if I wanted to play with a Mexican I could stay home 
and play with myself." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the stories in "Latins Anonymous," premiering at the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center tonight it's a true tale that goes for the laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the show came from Los Angeles actors Najera, Luisa Leschin, Diane 
Rodriguez and Armando Molina, who kept running into each other at Hollywood 
auditions as their agents sent them out, over and over again, for the same 
handful of stereotypical Latino roles in movies and television. 
</P>
<P>
The women compared resumes and noticed how nearly all the characters they 
played were maids or pregnant women named Maria. The men joked about how they 
were always cast as gang members or drug dealers named Juan, Paco or Hector. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to become really expert at making tortillas," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
They found they liked making each other laugh about their favorite Latino 
cliches: the Latin lover, the macho male and his obsession with blond females, 
the melodramatic Maria in "West Side Story," and the chubby Chicana who says: 
"If God wanted us to be skinny, he would have made us gringos." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they decided that they would use this material to write the type of 
show no one was offering -- comedy. 
</P>
<P>
After all, as Najera intoned with mock seriousness, "there's nothing funny 
about drug dealing." 
</P>
<P>
The show marks the first time that the Latino Theatre Lab at LATC has sponsored 
a group that it has neither commissioned nor developed itself. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what sold Jose Luis Valenzuela, the director of the lab, on the group 
was, simply, that they made him laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to find a lot of comedy," he said. "Everything else has 
been real political and heavy. This is actually fun." 
</P>
<P>
But the jokes have a serious side. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of a workshop production of the show presented by the Old Globe 
Theatre's Teatro Meta in San Diego, the barbs fell on everything from the guilt 
of Latinos who can't speak Spanish (like Najera and Rodriguez), to the 
embarrassment of Latinos who change their names, as did Leschin, who was born 
Luisa Josefina Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
The jokes struck a nerve with an influential network of Latino directors 
working under the flagship of major theaters, which have been carefully nursing 
the show towards its LATC debut. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Cruz Gonzalez, creator of the Hispanic Playwrights Project at South Coast 
Repertory Theatre, signed on last year as co-director with Miguel Delgado, 
choreographer of three of the last four Teatro Sin Fronteras projects at the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Moncada, program director of the Teatro Meta program, produced a workshop 
production earlier this month after falling "on the floor laughing" when the 
group tried out its number on changing names at Theater/Theatre in Los Angeles 
last February. Moncada had changed his name in 1970 when the Actors' Equity 
union told him they had enough Latino actors out of work and didn't want any 
others. So he signed up as Jeffrey Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
"That lasted only three years, but they were three very schizophrenic years," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the group, their favorite part of the show simply seems to be the fact 
that it exists at all. 
</P>
<P>
None of them expected the attention they have received since they began their 
first workshop on Valentine's Day in 1988 at Theater/Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
They now have dreams of being recognized as writers as well as actors and of 
playing leads rather than supporting roles. But for them, the work is still 
more than a vehicle; it is, as Leschin called it just before a rehearsal in San 
Diego, "therapy." 
</P>
<P>
"We admitted truths on stage that we would never have admitted in real life," 
said Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"We have participated in our own misrepresentation long enough," said Molina. 
</P>
<P>
"They are writing from their reality," said Leschin of L.A. writers. "Hollywood 
writers are seeing their image of Mexicans as their maids or their gardeners.

FORMAN TAKES SPOTLIGHT AT BON APPETIT

It was all Mitch Forman's show Sunday night at Bon Appetit. Even though the 
keyboardist's trio included such high-powered notables as bassist Brian 
Bromberg and drummer Tom Brechtlein, Forman was clearly in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Looking as intently dedicated to his collection of keyboards as inventor Rick 
Moranis was to his reducing machine in "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," Forman was 
virtually in perpetual motion. Steaming through a collection of original pieces 
bearing titles like "A Sea of Fertility" and "Polka For Mr. Nice Guy," he 
played with a passion and intensity that frequently belied the abstract nature 
of the compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Forman's richly textured style varied as he moved from instrument to 
instrument. On acoustic piano, his improvisations often overflowed with warmly 
traditional harmonic clusters. His synthesizer work, in contrast, was densely 
layered with overlapping sounds. Best of all, when he picked up an 
over-the-shoulder keyboard controller, his single-note lines darted and danced 
with the soaring levitation of a Space-Age Baryshnikov. 
</P>
<P>
Bromberg and Brechtlein, two of the strongest young rhythm section players in 
town, responded well to the driving urgency of Forman's music. Occasional 
confusing moments caused by inadequate rehearsal time usually were recycled 
into almost instinctive creative variations. It was the kind of 
instant-recovery music-making typical of what happens when spontaneity breaks 
out between good performers. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime New York-based musician, Forman has been on the West Coast for less 
than a year. But the Sunday night program clearly intimated that his 
no-holds-barred, hard-swinging approach to fusion-styled contemporary music is 
going to have considerable impact on the local scene. 
</P>
<P>
Forman, Bromberg and Brechtlein can also be heard at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks on 
Sunday and Monday. -- DON HECKMAN

LATE-NIGHT BLUES IN MIDDAY SUN AT LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Solomon Burke's set at the 10th annual Long Beach Blues Festival on Sunday was 
a textbook example of how the intangibles in music can make or break a 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
All the elements were in place for a major event. Burke, who has focused on 
gospel music for years, was performing (for the first time in 20 years in Los 
Angeles) the late '50s/early '60s R&amp;B hits like "Everybody Needs Somebody 
to Love" and "Got to Get You Off of My Mind" that made him one of the founding 
fathers of soul. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-pound singer was backed by an equally massive band of about two dozen, 
including a dozen horn players. With Burke's impeccable sense of phrasing and 
formidable powerful voice in top form, the arrangements were honed to a fine 
edge and the audience seemed poised to respond to Burke's animated 
exhortations. 
</P>
<P>
And yet somehow the music and audience connected only sporadically. Maybe it 
was the rushed tempos or the inherent difficulties of trying to put across a 
set heavy on soul ballads that dealt with intensely emotional, private themes 
in the mid-afternoon sun. At a club or concert hall with a spotlight focused on 
his dynamic stage preaching, Burke's performance would probably have been 
doubly effective. 
</P>
<P>
But he was the only artist during the two-day event on the Cal State Long Beach 
campus affected by the festival setting. The mellow, late-night blues style of 
Charles Brown sounded as good in daylight hours as the exuberant zydeco of 
Terrance Simien and the Mallet Playboys. It wasn't too incongruous to hear 
Brown closing his set by crooning "Merry Christmas, Baby" in mid-September, or 
Koko Taylor inducing the audience to sing "all night long" during "Wang Dang 
Doodle" at 3 in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But that's par for the course for the Long Beach Blues Festival -- even those 
who customarily loathe outdoor music events seem to enjoy it. The festival's 
atmosphere of picnic baskets, blankets and lawn chairs spread across the full 
expanse of a football field gives it the low-keyed ambience of an overgrown 
family picnic with about 10,000 people taking part. 
</P>
<P>
John Lee Hooker's 45-minute headlining set didn't break any new ground but the 
veteran boogie man's mere presence was enough to satisfy the crowd. He was in 
feisty form, injecting snatches of his raucous Delta blues guitar into the 
arrangements of his smooth, seven-piece backing band and unexpectedly prowling 
the stage during his set-closing number. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than focusing on material from his new album, "The Healer," Hooker -- 
who appears at the Palace Thursday -- tossed in such moody chestnuts as "Serve 
You Right to Suffer." His set provided a suitably low-key finale for the event, 
aided by lead guitarist Michael Osborn's skill at splitting the difference 
between Albert King's salty, stinging tone and Peter Green's low-volume 
melodism. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago blues queen Taylor, who battled hoarseness to deliver a consistently 
appealing set marked by lean, funky arrangements, was one surprise earlier in 
the day. But a bigger one was a report that this might be the final blues 
festival held on the Cal State Long Beach campus. Hard to fathom -- maybe they 
just don't realize what a unique, enjoyable event this is.

SKIPPER IS RESCUED AFTER FALLING OVERBOARD

Robert Hutchison stretched out in the folding chair on his boat deck Monday, 
squinted into the afternoon sun and tried to explain why he was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too embarrassed to die," joked Hutchison, he and a group of friends 
dissolving into hearty laughter. " . . . It was bad enough that I'd fallen 
over. I wasn't going to complicate things by dying." 
</P>
<P>
But he had come close. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, as his 50-foot sportfishing boat made its way from 
Santa Catalina Island to King Harbor in Redondo Beach, Hutchison tumbled over 
the rear of the boat and into the 64-degree waters off Long Point. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing only swimming trunks, the Redondo Beach general contractor swam for 4 
1/2 hours, finally reaching a mid-channel buoy. An hour later, about 12:30 
a.m., a Coast Guard cutter found him clinging to the buoy. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchison, 37, who suffered mild hypothermia but was not hospitalized, said he 
found Buoy 7TL by following the sound of its bell. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard ringing in the distance and just kept going in the direction of the 
buoy," said Hutchison, captain of the sportfisher Grand Slam. "When I got 
there, I just hung on." 
</P>
<P>
If he hadn't, a Coast Guard spokesman said, he might not have survived. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really fortunate there was a buoy out there," Lt. Jim Milbury said. 
"Otherwise, this could have been a real tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it had all the makings of one, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked bleak," said Bob Beauchamp, 41, who had been piloting the vessel 
that carried him, Hutchison and two others from a weekend fishing excursion 
Sunday. "About 10 or 20 minutes after he fell over, we saw that he was missing. 
We spent 4 1/2 hours searching before the Coast Guard told us to go back (in to 
port). . . . That's the limit they think a person can survive out there. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was ever going to see him again." 
</P>
<P>
But Hutchison, who fell overboard when the boat dipped suddenly as he emptied a 
bait tank into the water, said he remained optimistic throughout the ordeal. "I 
didn't want to be defeated," he said. "I wanted to see my family again. I 
thought of my (three) children the most. I wanted to see them again. I wanted 
to live." 
</P>
<P>
Even after the helicopter and two cutters dispatched by the Coast Guard 
arrived, rescuers had trouble spotting Hutchison in the darkness and 
two-foot-high swells. Hutchison led the crew to him by whistling. 
</P>
<P>
Had the cutter not discovered him, Hutchison said, he was prepared to continue 
toward the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they had missed me," he said. "I was just going to keep swimming."

L.A. PLANS TO PUT CURBS ON TRUCKS DESPITE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said Monday that the city will go ahead with a plan to 
restrict truck traffic during peak hours despite a state Senate vote Saturday 
that could help create a legal roadblock to the fees that are a critical part 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the law that stops us from imposing that fee," Bradley 
told reporters. "The Legislature did not affect our action with regard to 
adopting our truck management plan. That will go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley predicted that if truckers challenge the plan in court, they could end 
up paying fees higher than the maximum $60-per-vehicle charge envisioned by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, under pressure from trucking interests early Saturday in the waning 
hours of the legislative session, voted 25 to 10 to pass a bill that appears to 
limit the city's authority to impose the fees, which are critical to Bradley's 
plan to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution in Los Angeles. The fees 
would pay for a program to manage truck traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly already had approved the measure and Gov. George Deukmejian is 
expected to sign it into law. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, an amendment backed by the trucking industry, says that nothing in 
a controversial transportation bill introduced during the session could be 
construed as allowing local governments to impose fees "not otherwise 
authorized by law." 
</P>
<P>
Because the law is silent on the subject of local truck fees, city officials 
said over the weekend that they doubted whether their fee plan could withstand 
a court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, Bradley and his staff took a more positive tack. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the Legislature "did not stop us from imposing the fee. It simply 
gave the truckers some additional encouragement that they can file a lawsuit. 
We don't believe the lawsuit will be able to stand the light of day." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the truckers win a court challenge, Bradley said, the matter would then 
be turned over to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which could 
impose a much higher fee. The district is viewed as having stronger legal 
standing to impose fees on truckers. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of $60, which we were going to charge, it could be anything," Bradley 
said. "So I think that in the end they (the truckers) will be the losers." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bicker, Bradley's transportation specialist, said Monday, "We will proceed 
full steam ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Bicker said he does not believe the language added to the bill in the closing 
hours of the legislative session significantly improves the trucker's legal 
standing, or the likelihood of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they'd sue no matter what happened. They'll sue all the way along," 
Bicker said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's transportation plan, introduced nearly a year ago, is pending before 
the City Council's Transportation Committee.

HOUSING PROJECT IS A STUDY IN CONTRASTS; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE GUNPLAY, GANGS, CARMELITOS HAS ITS DEFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It is so tough that a postal carrier refuses to deliver mail there on her own, 
so rife with gunfire that a neighboring junior high school just built a 
10-foot-high block wall to protect students from stray bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Long Beach's Carmelitos Housing Project is considered a showplace of public 
housing projects, a well-kept complex of graffiti-free buildings in a quiet, 
park-like setting of trees and grass. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest and largest of Los Angeles County's public housing projects, 
Carmelitos defies and confirms the popular image of public housing. Residents 
in one breath praise it as the most pleasant project they have ever lived in. 
In the next they speak of nightly gunplay, gangs, chronic drug-dealing and fear 
of leaving their apartments after dark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portrayals Rejected 
</P>
<P>
In the end, they reject portrayals of their home as a singularly brutal place. 
"Why are they trying to make Carmelitos even worse than Los Angeles?" asked a 
defensive young woman, who like many of her neighbors, refused to give her 
name. "Everything that is going on here is going on everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
"This is paradise compared to other (public) housing developments," said Milton 
Patterson, a county housing manager who oversees Carmelitos and other county 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke recently near one of the project's main streets, standing on a lawn 
amid the contrasts of Carmelitos. Behind him were children romping in a 
playground. Down the block, men loitered on the sidewalk, occasionally 
sprinting to a stopping car for what appeared to be a drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
The dangers of Carmelitos were enough to prompt the U.S. Postal Service to 
suspend mail delivery for a few days late last month after a carrier was 
frightened by two men who jogged past her, carrying handguns. They were enough 
to prompt Lindbergh Junior High School to erect a 900-foot-long wall to 
separate it from the project. 
</P>
<P>
They are enough to rouse the fears of nearby neighborhoods, where community 
leader and Long Beach school board member Jerry Shultz argues that calling 
Carmelitos a showplace is a "a joke." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50-Year-Old Project 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 713-unit, 50-year-old complex is "no worse than some other areas of 
the city and better than some," Assistant Long Beach Police Chief Gene 
Brizzolara said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 63 murders committed in Long Beach this year, two have occurred in 
Carmelitos. 
</P>
<P>
To an extent, say its defenders, Carmelitos suffers from being Long Beach's 
only public housing project, a discrete community of 65 acres. "When you're the 
only one on the block, you get a lot of attention," said Carlos Jackson, 
assistant executive director of Los Angeles County's Community Development 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're not going to deliver mail to Carmelitos, they'd better not deliver 
mail to a lot of other areas," complained City Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg, 
who represents the area. Kellogg volunteered to accompany carriers through the 
project before the post office resumed service, pending construction of a 
central mail room next to the management office. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents complain that crime and drug-dealing have escalated 
dramatically in the last few years, drastically altering the way they live. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when you could sit outside at 2 or 3 in the morning, sit in 
the doorway and feel the breezes and the children could put up tents in the 
yard and sleep there all night. That's a thing of the past," said one woman who 
has lived in Carmelitos for more than a decade and reared four children there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troublemakers Came 
</P>
<P>
The turning point, she and others contend, was a $24-million rehabilitation of 
the complex four years ago. Apartments were emptied for remodeling, and when 
they were filled, many of them were filled with troublemakers from elsewhere, 
Carmelitos veterans insist. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably have the same feelings about them as Long Beach has about us," the 
woman said, referring to some of the newer tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Some old-timers complain that management is not adequately screening new 
tenants and that the renovation was shoddy. 
</P>
<P>
But it is outsiders who don't live there that reap the biggest share of blame 
for Carmelitos' woes. Crips gang members from Los Angeles and Compton have 
turned the complex into a drug-dealing headquarters, coming and going in 
shifts, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always, and I mean always, two or three people in the street selling 
drugs," said a man named Bill who was playing Frisbee with his younger brother 
on one of the project's rolling lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Patrol cars regularly cruise through Carmelitos. The county contracts for 
police protection with the Long Beach Police Department, which is required to 
have officers on the complex grounds a total of nine hours a day, in addition 
to answering calls. 
</P>
<P>
But when the patrols appear, the drug dealers just drift behind the buildings, 
only to emerge when the black-and-white cars turn the corner. "As far as 
running and hiding, this is a perfect place," said the mother of four, who, 
like others, said the dealers are organized and equipped with police scanners 
to warn them of approaching patrols. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Activity Monitored 
</P>
<P>
"Every parking lot here has at least three (police) scanners," said Danny 
Racer, 36, who has lived in Carmelitos off and on since he was a child. 
</P>
<P>
Racer said he routinely finds empty wallets on the grounds, discarded by 
addicts who steal them for cocaine money. His neighbors say they won't venture 
out with a purse. Some of them have dodged bullets. One saw a man repeatedly 
run over by a van in an apparent drug deal gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
"Every night you hear gunshots. If you don't, you wonder what is going on," 
said a woman who witnessed the van episode a few weeks ago, calling it " the 
most awful experience of my life." No one went to the man's rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what they're capable of and you don't want to be at the end of it," 
said another woman, echoing the widespread reluctance of residents to challenge 
the drug dealers or report them to police. 
</P>
<P>
Carmelitos' open grounds, numerous parking lots and easy access from two main 
streets, Atlantic and Orange avenues, make it hard for police and inviting to 
drug merchants, say officials, who are considering proposals to close one of 
the entrances to restrict access. 
</P>
<P>
"We will take care of the problem," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is so optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"You maybe can cut down on it," said one woman, alluding to the drug 
trafficking. "But you can't get rid of it."

HEARTS OF MANY ARE TOUCHED BY DEATH OF GIRL THEY DIDN'T KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
People shaken by a violent death came to St. Martha's Catholic Church in La 
Puente on Monday to pray for a little girl whose face they had never seen. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty West Covina police officers acted as pallbearers, since none of 
2-year-old Yahaira Jessica Aispuro's family was there. They carried the small 
pink casket to the front of the sanctuary during the memorial Mass as children 
from St. Martha's School sang hymns. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 150 mourners knew Jessica. And even on the 2600 block of Pauline 
Street in West Covina where the child lived with her mother and her mother's 
boyfriend, most people didn't know her name. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, they learned it in news stories reporting that the brown-eyed little 
girl with the pixie haircut was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Martha Araceli Aispuro, 25, is in custody, charged with being an 
accessory after the fact to murder, rape, sodomy and child molestation. Her 
boyfriend, Hector Ubaldo Soto, 22, is being held in Los Angeles County Jail on 
murder, child abuse, sodomy and child molestation charges. He could face the 
death penalty if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Strangers came to the funeral and momentarily became a community -- hugging 
each other, wondering. The child's natural father and aunt, the only other 
relatives authorities know of, are in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica, who had come to California with her mother a year ago, will be flown 
to her birthplace in Sinaloa today at the request of her aunt, Juana Aispuro. 
Her father, Armando de la Vega, 26, was contacted Friday by the county 
Department of Children's Services and notified of his daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
"She was violated by those who were to love her and care for her," said Father 
William Leser in his eulogy. "We know all the pain has ended, and she has now 
been called to live in the peace of our Father." 
</P>
<P>
Leser also reminded the congregation that Jessica's death, which authorities 
believe occurred after her mother was also beaten by Ubaldo Soto, is a warning 
to victims of abuse to tell someone before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
"This must teach women not to take abuse, never to allow boyfriends to hit 
them, to hurt them -- and then say it's because he loves her," Leser said. 
</P>
<P>
As the priest waved a censer over Jessica's casket, a quartet sang a song 
police officers composed in memory of abused children. 
</P>
<P>
After the service, seventh-graders at Edgewood High School in West Covina 
presented Leser with an $88.64 check to help with funeral expenses and to go to 
child abuse prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
Outside St. Martha's, Maria Patterson, 42, of La Puente couldn't hold back her 
tears as she told of calling the funeral home to ask how she could make a 
donation. She found out that Jessica had no burial clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Said Patterson: "I bought her a little pink dress and wrote her a poem."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 FROM L.A. WIN EDUCATOR AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Los Angeles County educators are recipients of $25,000 California 
Educator Awards, state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig has announced. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield High School mathematics teacher Ben Jimenez and curriculum specialist 
Cosetta Moore, both of the Los Angeles Unified School District, and arts 
teacher Barrie Becker of the Dorothy Kirby Center School, a special county 
school, were among 12 winners statewide chosen by the California Assn. of 
County Superintendents of Schools and the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said Becker was chosen because of her work teaching dance to juvenile 
delinquents, while Jimenez's efforts teaching college preparatory math to 
inner-city students has resulted in a 98% pass rate on advanced placement 
calculus exams. Moore, who oversees social science instruction for Los Angeles 
district elementary schools, helped develop a curriculum that incorporates 
community resources. 
</P>
<P>
The awards, which are funded by the Milken Family Foundation, aim to increase 
public support of education by honoring individual contributions, Honig said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NIGHT STALKER CASE LAWYER SENT TO JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Monday ordered Arturo Hernandez, one of 
three lawyers for Night Stalker defendant Richard Ramirez, to spend one day in 
County Jail for failing to pay a court-imposed $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Michael A. Tynan had imposed the fine Aug. 18 because Hernandez had 
violated another court order to check in with Tynan daily by telephone. 
Hernandez was to have paid the fine by Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was led out of court Monday to begin serving his sentence 
"forthwith." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose attorney has been one of Ramirez's lawyers of record for nearly 
four years now, but he has rarely been in court since jury selection began in 
July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tynan on Monday imposed additional fines of $2,400 on Hernandez, also for 
failure to check in with the court by phone earlier this month. He gave 
Hernandez until Sept. 29 to pay. 
</P>
<P>
The jury on Monday completed its 20th day of deliberations in the capital case 
in which Ramirez is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pursuit of a stolen car by sheriff's deputies in Lawndale ended in a geyser 
of water about 40 feet high when the car ran a red light at 75 m.p.h., crashed 
into a late model Lincoln, slightly injuring its driver, and then hit a fire 
hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the stolen car -- a 1990 Chrysler taken from a Torrance 
dealership -- James Earl Mays, 22, of Torrance, suffered minor injuries as did 
the driver of the Lincoln, Marilyn Causman, 45, also of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies had tried to stop the car for making an illegal U-turn, but Mays sped 
off, Sheriff's Sgt. Robin Sawyer said. Mays then allegedly tried to ram a 
sheriff's car in the ensuing pursuit but lost control and ran the light. 
</P>
<P>
Mays was booked for investigation of grand theft auto, assault with a deadly 
weapon (the car) on a peace officer and felony evading arrest.

MANUFACTURERS HANOVER DEAL OPENS U.S. BANKING TO DAI-ICHI KANGYO BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank on Monday disclosed that it would make the largest single 
move by a Japanese financial institution into American banking by spending 
$1.28 billion for a majority stake in Manufacturers Hanover Corp.'s CIT Group, 
a business-lending unit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Dai-Ichi Kangyo will spend $120 million for a 4.9% stake in the 
New York bank itself. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Manufacturers Hanover said it will boost by $950 million its 
reserves that cushion it against problem loans to developing countries, 
primarily in Latin America. As a result, the bank said, it expects to post a 
loss of $775 million in the third quarter and $475 million for the year. 
</P>
<P>
For Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the world's largest bank, the purchase of 60% of CIT Group 
and the small stake in Manufacturers Hanover represents its first major move 
into the U.S. banking market. The Tokyo-based bank, which had $415 billion in 
assets as of March 31, has been surprisingly slow to enter the U.S. market 
while some of its Japanese competitors have done so aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought From RCA 
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese banks with a major presence include Mitsubishi Bank, which owns 
Bank of California in San Francisco; Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank, which have 
major operations in California; Bank of Tokyo, which owns Union Bank in San 
Francisco, and Mitsui Bank, which is forging close ties to Security Pacific 
Corp. in Los Angeles. In a separate announcement Monday, Daiwa Bank of Japan 
agreed to buy the U.S. commercial banking business of Lloyds Bank of Great 
Britain for $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
CIT, which Manufacturers Hanover bought from RCA in 1984 for $1.5 billion, 
provides loans mostly to medium-sized businesses. It has assets of more than 
$9.7 billion. Last week, Manufacturers Hanover confirmed that it was 
negotiating to sell a stake in the operation to Dai-Ichi Kangyo. 
</P>
<P>
The moves by Manufacturers Hanover are part of a broad, four-part plan 
announced by the bank to strengthen its capital position and offset its Latin 
American loans. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, it plans to raise as much as $620 million through the sale of stock. 
It plans to sell up to $500 million in new common stock to the public. In 
addition, it is selling 2.7 million shares for $45 each to Dai-Ichi Kangyo. As 
part of the stock sale, Dai-Ichi Kangyo agreed not to buy more Manufacturers 
Hanover stock for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover Chairman John F. McGillicuddy said in a statement that 
recent debt negotiations with Mexico and the U.S. government's plan for cutting 
the Third World's $1.3-billion debt, called the Brady Plan after Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, contributed to the decision to increase its 
reserves. Those moves are expected to make it harder for banks to collect 
outstanding loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lagged in Past 
</P>
<P>
Banks are facing increasing pressure to raise their reserves on their Latin 
American debt. British banks recently raised their reserves to 50%. In 
addition, some American bankers believe that regulators at the Federal Reserve 
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may pressure banks to 
increase reserves. 
</P>
<P>
James J. McDermott Jr., an analyst in New York who follows Manufacturers 
Hanover for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., said the move by itself is 
unlikely to trigger other banks to add to their reserves immediately because 
Manufacturers Hanover in the past has lagged behind other major banks doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover is raising its reserves to $2.4 billion of its 
$6.8-billion medium- and long-term loan portfolio to developing nations. That 
means Manufacturers Hanover now has reserves totaling 36 cents for each dollar 
that it has provided less developed countries, compared to 22 cents for each 
dollar before. The vast majority of its foreign loans are to Mexico, Brazil, 
Venezuela, Argentina and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed told securities analysts that he is 
comfortable with Citicorp's level of reserves for its loans to developing 
countries, although he left open the possibility that it may add to them soon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management to Remain 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America, with reserves totaling about 37% on its medium- and long-term 
debt of $7.4 billion to developing countries, declined to comment on whether 
the move by Manufacturers Hanover would affect its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Both Manufacturers Hanover and Dai-Ichi Kangyo sought to emphasize that CIT 
would continue to operate normally, despite the change in control. The 
management will remain, with Albert R. Gamper Jr. as CIT's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its size, Dai-Ichi Kangyo could face problems making the CIT investment 
work. Some bankers wondered whether it may have an experience similar to Fuji 
Bank Ltd.'s 1984 purchase of Walter E. Heller &amp; Co., a Chicago finance firm 
troubled with bad loans to small and medium-sized businesses.

HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: CREATIVITY NEEDED TO STEM UNIONS' DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Bernstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lane Kirkland, the country's top labor leader, has been calling for repeal of 
the National Labor Relations Act, the federal law that did more than any other 
to promote the spectacular growth of unions from the 1940s into the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by the pro-management way that the law has been administered since 
President Ronald Reagan took office nearly nine years ago, the AFL-CIO 
president suggests abolishing it even though the 1935 measure was written 
specifically to encourage the development of unions to offset the enormous 
power of corporations over individual workers. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which is administered by the National Labor Relations Board, never 
achieved that balance, and unions now represent an ever-diminishing proportion 
of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, though, unions use their legitimate complaints about the 
pro-management enforcement of the law as an excuse for their own failure to 
recruit members fast enough to keep up with the growth of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, many union leaders, including Kirkland, are now considering what 
more they can do to revive their flagging organizations. 
</P>
<P>
They have started a host of new programs, from low-interest credit cards to 
free legal advice, to try to achieve that goal. They are also recognizing that 
they talk too much and do too little about the crucial job of organizing new 
members. 
</P>
<P>
An organizing institute just opened by the AFL-CIO will study ways of 
recruiting members and training organizers. One innovation expected to come 
from the institute is a program to help unions pool their resources. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a union that is training apprentice organizers will be asked to 
let its apprentices help other unions with major campaigns, thus making 
on-the-job training available to the new organizers and helping other unions at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Even though some progress is being made, Kirkland contends that unions would 
fare better under the "law of the jungle" -- that is, no law at all -- than the 
time-consuming and costly legal roadblocks that they have been facing under the 
National Labor Relations Act. 
</P>
<P>
Few other union leaders go as far as Kirkland, and for all his radical 
rhetoric, neither he nor any other officer of the 14-million-member labor 
federation has officially asked Congress to repeal the law. 
</P>
<P>
They should not. The law provides sensible general rules of conduct for both 
labor and management, though changes are essential to make it work more 
effectively, and it must be administered more even-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
Unions often seem to put off major organizing campaigns in the vague hope of 
electing state and federal legislators who might pass new laws to make the 
campaigns easier to win, one union officer contends. 
</P>
<P>
William H. Wynn, president of the 1.3-million-member United Food and Commercial 
Workers Union, recommends forgetting that hope because it won't be realized in 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn does not say, as Kirkland does, that unions would be better off without 
the National Labor Relations Act, but he does suggest that, whenever possible, 
unions should simply ignore the NLRB. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of unions are doing just that. They are less frequently 
asking the NLRB to conduct elections to determine if workers in a company want 
to be represented by a union, a process that can be lengthy and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a union often tries to get workers to sign cards saying they want a 
union, and if a majority of them sign up, the union goes directly to the 
management and demands recognition, bypassing the NLRB entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn says the UFCW has organized about 100,000 members in each of the past two 
years, and only 10% of those new members were won through NLRB-conducted 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
The union actually made a net gain of only 40,000 members, however, because it 
lost thousands of others, mostly due to store closings that resulted from 
corporate mergers, leveraged buyouts and consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
There are several effective ways to persuade management to negotiate a contract 
with a union that has not gone through the NLRB election process. 
</P>
<P>
One way is to make it "prohibitively expensive" for a company to continue 
fighting efforts to negotiate a union contract after a majority of workers have 
signed union authorization cards, Wynn says. 
</P>
<P>
The union can use the traditional picket lines around a target company's stores 
to encourage a consumer boycott. But more interesting is the newer tactic being 
used by the UFCW and other unions. 
</P>
<P>
They ask pro-union workers at a target non-union company to look for company 
violations of anything from health and safety and minimum wage laws to 
anti-discrimination and environmental protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
When violations are found -- and Wynn says they usually are -- the union then 
can use the evidence it has gathered to push government agencies for a 
crackdown on the violators that often results in fines against the company and 
more protection for workers and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
That tactic could cost the target company more in fines and lost time than it 
could expect to save by continuing to fight unionization. 
</P>
<P>
The same tactic is being used in labor disputes at unionized companies, but its 
effectiveness is still being tested. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, with their new strategies, unions are gaining members without 
going through NLRB elections. And when they do go through the NLRB, they are 
winning increasing numbers of the elections, although still not a majority of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The self-criticism in which unions are engaging these days seems to be helping 
them in a limited way, but much more innovative thinking is needed before they 
can again become the powerful force that they once were in this country.

JUDGE TELLS JUSTICE DEPT. TO PROBE PRESS LEAKS ABOUT MILKEN CASE

<P>
A federal judge Monday directed the Justice Department to launch an 
investigation into leaks of confidential grand jury information in the criminal 
case against former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond chief Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who is presiding over the case against 
Milken, asked during a hearing that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan and 
the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility in Washington 
begin an inquiry into leaks to the press. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Atty. Jess Fardella, one of the lead 
prosecutors in the Milken case, told the judge that he had already made a 
similar request for an investigation of the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing followed a request last week by lawyers for Milken and his brother, 
Lowell. In a motion filed with the court, they had asserted that prosecutors or 
the Securities and Exchange Commission had deliberately leaked information 
about the case to the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles 
Times and the New York Times. The Milkens' lawyers had asserted that the leaks 
were part of a deliberate plot to apply pressure on potential witnesses to 
cooperate with the government. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, said that at least for the moment she wouldn't grant the 
defense lawyers' request for an evidentiary hearing before the trial, in which 
they could cross-examine witnesses in court about the source of the leaks. 
Instead, Judge Wood said she probably would hold such a hearing after the 
trial, which is tentatively scheduled for March, 1990. She said that, in the 
meantime, she would ask Justice Department officials to report to her 
periodically in closed proceedings in her chambers about the progress of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear if the investigators would attempt to interrogate or subpoena 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
98-Count Indictment 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, special assistant to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said: "If the 
judge has ordered us to investigate the leaks, we certainly will." Runkel said 
reporters generally haven't been subpoenaed in past investigations of leaks, 
and he said it would be premature to say what techniques may be used in the 
investigation. But he said Thornburgh feels "it would be helpful if they came 
forward and cooperated in such investigations," adding that "Thornburgh feels 
that they're not beyond the scope of subpoenas in cases such as this." 
</P>
<P>
The Milken brothers and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg were named in a 
98-count racketeering and securities fraud indictment in March. Since then, the 
grand jury investigation has continued, and a new, "superseding" indictment 
with additional charges is expected in the case. The three have denied the 
allegations and said they will fight the charges. 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal for government officials to disclose information that is before a 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Fardella said the inquiry would be conducted by 
Victor Pohorelsky, the deputy chief of the criminal division in the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Manhattan, under the supervision of the Office of 
Professional Responsibility. The latter office is charged with ensuring the 
integrity of Justice Department employees, including federal prosecutors.

SUIT OUTLINES HOW LINCOLN ALLEGEDLY GENERATED PHONY PROFITS FOR PARENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hidden Valley Ranch, 8,576 acres of undeveloped land southwest of Phoenix, is 
largely barren and, as its name implies, is difficult to reach. 
</P>
<P>
But what was hidden from most observers was not so much the valley as the way 
that its owner, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, allegedly used the land to generate 
phony profits from fraudulent transactions, according to the $1.1-billion 
racketeering lawsuit that federal regulators filed last week against Charles H. 
Keating and other former operators of the Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The bogus profits boosted the amount that Lincoln forwarded to its parent, 
American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, ostensibly to pay its share of corporate 
taxes, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
The tax-sharing plan was one of the ways in which the parent firm allegedly 
drained Lincoln funds to fuel American Continental's speculative real estate 
deals and enrich its owners, the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders benefited, the suit alleges, from excessive loans made by Lincoln to 
companies that they controlled and from American Continental's stock value, 
boosted by the unusually healthy financial results that Lincoln was posting 
with inflated revenue. Keating sold some of his stock in 1987, for instance, 
for $3.3 million, which was in addition to his $2-million salary. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental filed 
for bankruptcy, saying the S&amp;L was being operated in an unsafe manner. 
Experts predict that Lincoln will be the nation's costliest S&amp;L bailout, 
costing taxpayers up to $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-sharing plans allow a subsidiary to send its share of taxes to its parent, 
which pays the entire tax bill for the holding company and all subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lincoln's arrangement with its parent, the suit alleges, Lincoln funneled 
federally insured deposits into a series of questionable deals that created 
artificial profits -- and allowed the S&amp;L to ship a total of $94.8 million 
to its parent for taxes over three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Lincoln didn't have any taxable income for those years and, therefore, 
didn't owe any taxes, the suit claims. Nor did American Continental use the 
money that Lincoln forwarded under the tax-sharing plan to pay taxes, the suit 
alleges. "The true but hidden purpose of the arrangement was to allow ACC to 
siphon funds from . . . Lincoln for the enrichment of ACC," Keating and his 
family and associates, the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
The Hidden Valley deals, as well as other transactions cited in the suit, also 
helped Lincoln get around regulations designed to limit its ownership interests 
in real estate and securities, the suit claims. Because the transactions were 
shams arranged by insiders, the suit states, Lincoln never really sold its 
investments and still controlled those assets. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for American Continental would not comment on allegations in the 
suit, saying the company would make its response in court. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate executives previously denied all wrongdoing, specifically stating 
that loans and sales that Lincoln made were not contrivances to hide unlawful 
direct investments. They have said repeatedly that regulators had spent the 
past four years reviewing their records and even approved some transactions. 
Nothing in the lawsuit, one spokesman said last week, comes as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Loans Defaulted 
</P>
<P>
A Lincoln subsidiary bought the vacant Hidden Valley land for about $28.6 
million and, from October, 1986, through June, 1988, sold three-quarters of it 
in the 10 transactions. It recorded a profit of nearly $82.1 million, which 
resulted in $31 million being sent to American Continental for taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The transactions characteristically involved "straw" men who borrowed the 
entire purchase price directly or indirectly from Lincoln to buy the property, 
the suit said. And Lincoln assumed the risk of possible losses because the 
borrowers were allowed to limit their risk of default to the property itself, 
the suit said. All the loans defaulted, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
In one of those transactions, Ernest C. Garcia went to Keating and his 
associates for a loan early in 1987 to buy the remaining stock in a Phoenix 
real estate development and investment banking firm, according to the lawsuit. 
Garcia already owned 20% of what now is called E. C. Garcia &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
A major condition for providing the loan, however, was Garcia's agreement to 
buy or arrange for the purchase of a 1,000-acre parcel of Hidden Valley for $14 
million, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia could not or would not buy the parcel, but he arranged for 
Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp. to buy the parcel and satisfy 
Keating's demand, a requirement that allegedly violated federal law. 
</P>
<P>
On March 30, 1987, Lincoln loaned Garcia $20.2 million. While Garcia used a 
"significant" portion of the loan to buy Garcia Co. stock, the suit alleges, he 
also loaned Westcontinental $3.5 million on the same day for that company's 
down payment on the Hidden Valley property. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Westcontinental borrowed $10.5 million from a Lincoln 
subsidiary for the remaining amount owed.

'90 JAPANESE CARS AGAIN TOP EPA MILEAGE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese auto makers are still producing the most fuel-efficient cars -- tiny 
compacts getting up to 55 miles per gallon -- while the list of "gas guzzlers" 
is dominated by expensive, luxurious European models, government fuel economy 
figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle mileage survey, based on industry and government tests on all 1990 
model cars, trucks and vans, showed little change over the previous year, 
although the number of vehicles subject to the gas-guzzler tax dropped to 32 
from 40. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, which can add $3,850 to the price of a car, kicks in on automobiles 
that get overall fuel efficiency of less than 22.5 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Larson, branch manager of the EPA testing lab in Ann Arbor, Mich., said 
that overall the nearly 1,000 models tested averaged 24 m.p.g. in combined 
city-highway driving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Push for More 
</P>
<P>
They ranged from the top-rated Geo Metro XFI, a small Japanese-made car sold by 
General Motors, at a combined 55 m.p.g., including 58 m.p.g. on the highway, to 
the two-seater Lamborghini Countach, which managed only 6 m.p.g. in city 
driving and 10 m.p.g. on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
The mileage results are based on tests conducted by the manufacturer under 
laboratory conditions, with about 30% of the tests verified by the EPA. Larson 
said the EPA figures have been adjusted from original laboratory results to 
more closely reflect driving conditions. The reductions were 10% for city 
driving and 22% for highway driving, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larson said that although the figures, displayed on automobile window stickers, 
are adjusted to reflect driving conditions, results still can vary because of 
driving habits. 
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics come amid an increased clamor in Congress and among 
environmentalists to push auto makers into hiking the fuel efficiency of their 
cars and trucks not only to save petroleum but also to curb the release of 
automobile pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
In releasing the mileage figures, the Environmental Protection Agency said the 
most fuel-efficient cars on the list emit about one-third of a pound of carbon 
dioxide per mile traveled, while the worst gas guzzler releases about twice 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide is a chief contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect, which 
many scientists predict will lead to a significant warming of the Earth if not 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the top 10 cars with an overall mileage rating of at least 39 m.p.g. 
was made outside the United States, mostly in Japan. The stingiest U.S.-made 
car was the Ford Escort, with an overall mileage rating of 38 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 cars with the best mileage per gallon were three versions of the Geo 
Metro, two versions of the Honda Civic CRX, three versions of the Suzuki Swift, 
the Daihatsu Charade and the diesel-powered Volkswagen Jetta. 
</P>
<P>
The Lamborghini was among six cars tested that are subject to the maximum 
$3,850 excise tax for poor gas mileage. The others facing the maximum tax are 
the Ferrari Testarossa and four Rolls-Royce models. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the 10 worst mileage cars were the BMW 750IL, the Porsche 928 S4, 
the Audi V8 and the Maserati 228. 
</P>
<P>
The only domestic cars subject to the gas-guzzler tax were two Cadillac models, 
the Allante and the larger engine (350 cubic inches) Brougham, which have 
combined city and highway mileage of 18 and 17 m.p.g., respectively, and a $500 
tax surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year escaped because of 
mileage improvements in 1990 models. These included the Chrysler TC by Maserati 
and the Chrysler New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler 
models that fell under the guzzler tax in 1989.

DEBT PLAN FOCUSES TOO MUCH ON REDUCTION, BANKS WARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The world's major commercial banks warned Monday that the Bush Administration's 
new Third World debt strategy may end up in failure if it places too much 
emphasis on debt-reduction instead of promoting more new lending to Latin 
American countries. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the International Monetary Fund, the bankers cautioned that 
"excessive focus on debt reduction, particularly at discounts that banks regard 
as punitive, will result in banks' permanent exit from future lending to 
middle-income countries." 
</P>
<P>
They warned that expectations about how much developing countries' debt burdens 
actually can be reduced "must become realistic." They urged authorities to give 
increased attention to stemming capital flight in debtor countries as a way to 
help them meet their debt service. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, made public by the Institute of International Finance, which 
represents 184 commercial banks around the world, served to underscore the 
resistance that U.S. authorities are encountering in persuading banks to go 
along with the new Third World debt plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banks Resist Plan 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, developed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, commercial 
banks would exchange portions of their bank debt for a smaller amount of 
securities from the debtor countries. The interest payments on these securities 
would be backed by the IMF or World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The debt burdens of these countries are increasing so rapidly that debtor 
countries now are sending more money back to rich countries than they are 
receiving. The World Bank reported over the weekend that the net cash drain 
from Third World countries has reached $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the banks, reluctant to discount their loan portfolios too deeply, have 
been resisting the Brady formula. Several, offered such a choice in a recent 
deal with Mexico, have opted to provide new loans to the country rather than 
trade their old ones for securities. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Horst Schulmann, the former West German Finance Ministry official who 
now serves as managing director of the Institute of International Finance, said 
Monday that the opportunities for such Brady plan-style exchanges are limited. 
The plan was unveiled last March and put into effect in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
Schulmann noted that the Philippines, which recently completed negotiations 
with commercial banks, sought to increase its borrowing rather than trade its 
old loans for securities. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see a long list of candidates (for debt-reduction deals) around the 
corner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said countries such as Brazil and Argentina are ineligible for Brady plan 
debt-reduction deals because they have not yet won approval of domestic 
economic reform plans from the IMF -- a prerequisite to any such swaps. 
</P>
<P>
He termed Venezuela's demand for a 50% reduction in its foreign debt burden, 
which Caracas has said it will seek in negotiations now under way between 
commercial banks and the government, as "totally unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
And he suggested that other countries such as Chile and Uruguay might find that 
prodding banks into discounting their loans as part of Brady plan deals could 
impede prospects for them to regain access to credit markets -- a major goal of 
many debtors now. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the debt-reduction effort believe that it helps Third World 
countries more to provide them with new loan money to use to finance their 
economic development than to reduce their overall debt-burdens, which carries 
relatively less impact per dollar of help.

3 AIRLINES MAY JOIN ON RESERVATION SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines said Monday that 
they are discussing the formation of a combined computer reservations system. 
</P>
<P>
If the merger takes place, the resulting reservations system would become the 
nation's third largest -- after those owned by American Airlines and United 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the three carriers said such a transaction would join the 
PARS system, which has been jointly owned by TWA and Northwest since 1986, and 
Delta's DATAS II. However, they said their talks are only in a "preliminary" 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines said the new entity, if it is created, would be independently 
operated as an autonomous company with its own management. The action would 
eliminate one of the five computer reservations systems in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The CRS operations -- especially the largest ones -- are very profitable for 
the airlines that own them. Travel agents use the systems to make airline 
reservations for clients, to make hotel and tour reservations and to order 
rental cars. The agents can also do much of their own accounting on the 
computer terminals that the reservations system companies install in their 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Most travel agents use only one of the systems, paying a fee -- which is 
negotiable -- to have the equipment installed. The CRS companies make their 
money from fees collected from the airlines, rental car companies and hotels, 
etc., for which the tickets are sold. The typical fee is $1.85 per transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Transportation has calculated that 15% of American 
Airlines' 1986 revenue and 10% of Delta's resulted from the built-in advantages 
of owning their own systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Merger Hit Snag 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Delta, one of the most profitable U.S. airlines, is at a big 
disadvantage because its DATAS II is the nation's smallest computer 
reservations system. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we are pursuing this merger," said Delta spokesman Jim Lundi, "is 
to increase the subscriber base for our system, to make the system worthwhile, 
to make it competitive. It is important to reach a critical mass." 
</P>
<P>
Besides American's Sabre system, United Airlines' Apollo system, DATAS II and 
PARS, Texas Air Corp., parent of Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines, 
owns and operates System One. There are also six other systems in Asia, Canada 
and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Delta had hoped to merge its CRS system into American's in a deal valued at $2 
billion announced in February. Delta was to have paid American $650 million to 
form the partnership. The two carriers would each have owned 25% of the new 
company and the remaining shares would have been sold to other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
But the Justice Department said in June that it planned to block the merger as 
anti-competitive and in violation of the antitrust laws. As a result, the two 
carriers abandoned their plans. 
</P>
<P>
In August, American said it was talking to two smaller U.S. airlines -- 
Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air Lines -- and to a European airline consortium 
about selling them shares in its Sabre system. 
</P>
<P>
The American reservations system has about 38% of total CRS revenue in this 
country. Apollo has about 30% and System One has about 11%. If the PARS and 
DATAS II systems are merged, it would have the rest of the U.S. market -- about 
21%. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo actually is owned by a company named Covia, half of which is owned by 
UAL Corp., United's parent. The other half is owned by USAir and a number of 
European carriers.

DOW UP 12.92 AS LATE SURGE LIFTS MARKET

<P>
Blue chip issues led the stock market higher Monday on the strength of a late 
flurry of buying near the close of a sluggish session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down about 77 points over the past two 
weeks, rose 12.92 to 2,687.50. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 751 up, 693 down and 512 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 136.94 million shares, down from 234.87 million Friday, 
when activity was increased by the quarterly "triple witching hour" involving a 
group of expiring stock-index options and futures. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
166.73 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were reluctant to make any big commitments either way 
while they kept a watchful eye on the market for high-yield junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The market for those securities, commonly used to finance takeovers and 
buyouts, has been rocked lately by problems at Campeau Corp., which used debt 
to finance a coast-to-coast U.S. retailing empire. 
</P>
<P>
If the junk bond market suffers a lasting loss of investor confidence, brokers 
say, stocks might undergo a difficult reappraisal by traders no longer ready or 
able to chase after takeover news and rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be witnessing the beginnings of a completely different type of stock 
market from the one we've known for four or five years," said analyst Greg 
Smith at Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also cited widespread talk that stocks were due for a "correction," or 
short-term pullback, after their sharp rise over the first eight months of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 
7/8 at 41 3/8; McDonald's, up 3/4 at 30 1/2; Chevron, up 1 1/8 at 59; General 
Electric, up 3/8 at 57 5/8, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2 1/2 at 121 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues rose 70.66 to 34,472.54. It 
gained 114.94 Thursday, the final trading day last week because Friday was a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at a 
session high of 2,373.8, up 7.3. Volume was 310.2 million shares, down sharply 
from 725.9 million shares on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices dipped in thin trading as many investors sat out the session and 
waited for today's scheduled release of the government's consumer price report. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 1/8 point, or $1.25 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield rose to 8.09% from 8.07% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts described Monday's session as quiet as traders were reluctant to 
significantly adjust their holdings in advance of the August consumer price 
report, a major inflation indicator. 
</P>
<P>
If the report indicates that inflation is moderating, bond prices could rise, 
because the Federal Reserve is believed to be more likely to relax credit and 
allow interest rates to fall if inflation slows. Bond prices rise when rates 
come down. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
governments were 3/32 point to 5/32 point lower, intermediate maturities ranged 
from 1/16 point to 3/32 point lower and long-term issues were off 3/32 point to 
1/8 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.875%, down from 9.625% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar dropped again in the aftermath of the panicky decline at the end of 
last week, hurt by traders' fears of central bank selling and the uncertain 
effect of an impending meeting of finance ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices also fell following gains overseas. Republic National Bank quoted 
gold at $360.70 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared to $362.50 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.43 Japanese yen, up 0.58 yen. In London, the 
dollar was quoted at 145.85 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York, the 
dollar fetched 145.93 yen, down from 146.35 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.5695 late Monday, more expensive than the 
$1.5390 rate late Friday. Later in New York, the pound fetched $1.5710, more 
expensive than its $1.5660 rate late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled 
at $361.70 an ounce, down $2.20 from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures prices fell to new life-of-contract lows on New York's Coffee, 
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange following the international cocoa cartel's failure 
to salvage a derailed price-support scheme. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell sharply; livestock and meat 
futures were mixed; precious metals were lower, and energy futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures settled $54 to $67 lower.

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: IT'S COMMERCIAL DEJA VU AS OLD AD SLOGANS BECOME 
THE 'LATEST' THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Timex hired a new ad firm last year, officials at the agency told Timex 
executives exactly what they didn't want to hear. 
</P>
<P>
Why not bring back the slogan made famous by John Cameron Swayze: "It takes a 
licking and keeps on ticking." For that matter, the agency suggested, why not 
bring back Swayze himself to say it? 
</P>
<P>
At first, Timex didn't like either idea. For one, Swayze, who is 83, was too 
ill at the time to appear in the new ads. And besides, with hot competitors 
such as Swatch, Timex desperately wanted to modernize its image -- not reach 
back into the vault for a decades-old ad slogan. 
</P>
<P>
But research convinced Timex otherwise. It revived the slogan and is just one 
of many advertisers returning to their pasts. An epidemic of nostalgia for the 
ads that baby boomers were brought up with seems to be sweeping Madison Avenue 
these days. "Two mints in one" recently made a commercial return for Certs. The 
"Nestea Plunge" is back again. The familiar "Sometimes you feel like a nut, 
sometimes you don't" slogan for Almond Joy and Mounds candy bars is back on TV. 
And, yes, you are again hearing Campbell's soup's "Mmmmm, Good," and Maxwell 
House Coffee's "Good to the last drop." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Timex, the company asked 2,000 consumers what they remembered 
most about the watch maker. "Just about everyone said, 'It takes a licking and 
keeps on ticking,' " said Ron Sok, manager of advertising at Timex. "Keep in 
mind, we hadn't used that slogan in our ads for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
So, Timex went back to the future, dusted off its old slogan and added a few 
funny modern twists. One ad, which has been running for months, features Timex 
watches that are strapped to the bellies of two Sumo wrestlers. And a new 
commercial scheduled to be broadcast next month shows a psychic with special 
powers who is able to bend a key and a fork, but naturally can't get the Timex 
to tick its last tock. 
</P>
<P>
Another new Timex ad that will run next month features an opera singer whose 
shrill voice breaks every object in the opera hall -- except the Timex. And for 
nostalgia's sake, the new Timex ads even feature the old recordings of stalwart 
spokesman Swayze verifying that the watch is, indeed, still ticking. "It's the 
best way to leverage the fact that you've been in business for a while," said 
Houman Pirdavari, art director at Timex's Minneapolis ad firm, Fallon 
McElligott. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers who are reusing these slogans insist that the trend is not because 
of some sort of creativity dearth. Instead, they say, the best slogans often 
are the tried and true -- especially when people remember these old campaigns 
as if they'd just heard them. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it doesn't matter what you say in ads, just as long as you have the 
money to say it over and over again," said Michael Ray, professor of marketing 
at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. "Even if you don't 
remember an old ad slogan exactly," said Ray, "when you hear it again, it can 
jog your mind in a very powerful way." 
</P>
<P>
But some ad executives say the reason for this trend is all too clear. "There 
are few really good ideas that people respond to," said Cliff Freeman, 
president of the New York ad agency Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners. "For lack of 
any new ideas, people fall back on the old ones." 
</P>
<P>
He ought to know. Back in 1973, Freeman wrote the catchy ad slogan for the 
Almond Joy and Mounds candy bar commercials. Now, after years of not using the 
slogan, Hershey revived it this month in its TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
But the company says the return to its former slogan was mandated by research 
-- not by a lack of new ideas. "We hadn't run that campaign since 1981," said 
Bill Stamey, brand manager at Hershey Chocolate USA in Hershey, Pa. "But in our 
research, people kept playing it back to us as if we'd never stopped using it." 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely why the maker of Certs also this month began to broadcast the 
familiar breath mints ad slogan. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to develop new ads for the campaign," said Jo Ann Meyer, senior 
vice president and creative director at the New York ad agency Young &amp; 
Rubicam. "But every consumer we asked kept repeating that line that's been gone 
for seven years." 
</P>
<P>
Using another ad agency's slogan is not something many ad firms like to do. "We 
were pretty skeptical," said Meyer. "It's always nice to come up with a 
brand-new campaign. But the consumers kept telling us something else." So the 
line, "Two mints in one," has returned, but this time it is set to music. The 
agency also added the line, "Two is better than one." 
</P>

And after several years of trying to convince American consumers that "Soup is 
good food," Campbell's has dumped the slogan and once again returned to the old 
faithful, "Mmmmm, Good." 
</P>
<P>
The company denies that the change is in any way related to investigations by 
the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general from nine states, who 
have questioned the health claims made for some Campbell products. "The old 
standby tested very well with consumers," said Pam Marcus, senior vice 
president at Campbell's New York ad agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates. "Besides, 
the time is right. Nostalgia is in." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Nestea plunge -- where people take a swig of Nestea and suddenly get 
drenched -- recently returned to TV after an eight-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't go back to it out of desperation or because we couldn't do something 
better," said Richard Di Lallo, senior vice president and creative director at 
the New York ad agency J. Walter Thompson. "The research was overwhelming. It 
no longer makes sense not to use it."

L.A. Gear Looks at Best Way to Use Jackson 
</P>
<P>
Is Michael Jackson worth $20 million to L.A. Gear? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. But only if Jackson sings in the commercials -- and only if the ads are 
very narrowly targeted toward kids ages 6 to 11. At least, that is the opinion 
of Steven Levitt, president of Marketing Evaluations, a Port Washington, 
N.Y.-based research firm that is very highly regarded for its detailed research 
on celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"If the ads contain his music and are directed at kids, he could be great for 
them," said Levitt. "But if he tries to be a spokesperson or does anything 
other than sing and dance, it could be a dismal failure." 
</P>
<P>
Levitt said there are plenty of other celebrities who rate much higher with 
kids than Jackson -- including Michael Jordan, who is a spokesman for rival 
Nike. And he said Jackson is not particularly popular with teen-agers or 
adults. Still, Jackson's popularity with children has remained "extremely high" 
since the company began researching the pop star in 1985, he said. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear executives have stated that their new line of athletic shoes, 
"Unstoppable," which Jackson will help design and market, will indeed be aimed 
at kids. L.A. Gear Chairman Robert Y. Greenberg said Jackson is likely to star 
in a L.A. Gear video promoting youth fitness. "He will talk to children of all 
ages around the world," said Sandy Saemann, executive vice president at L.A. 
Gear. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, company executives say that despite the addition of Jackson, 
former Los Angeles Laker Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will continue to be a spokesman 
for L.A. Gear. A new commercial that features Abdul-Jabbar was recently filmed 
but probably will not be broadcast until spring. 
</P>
<P>
Saemann said L.A. Gear plans to build an office for Jackson at its 
headquarters. And as for Jackson's corporate title, jested Saemann: "It will be 
Sir Michael."

RATES DROP AS CREDIT CARDS GET COMPETITIVE

Interest rates on Visa and Master Cards have dropped, a study released Monday 
indicated, and analysts said the development shows that the credit card 
industry is becoming increasingly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The American Bankers Assn. said during its annual meeting in Nashville that a 
survey of 453 banks shows interest rates on Visa and Master Cards decreased to 
an average range of 16.7% to 17.8% last year, compared to an average range of 
16.4% to 18.5% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that consumers are paying less in annual fees. The 
membership rates dropped from an average range of $15 to $17 this past year 
from $15.60 to $18.20 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The survey results mirror the intense competition in the bank card market 
today," said Robert H. Burke, chairman of the trade association's bank card 
division. "The range of choices for consumers today has never been greater and 
bank prices reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
As part of a sweepstakes to promote its regular credit card, Visa U.S.A. 
introduced a one-of-a-kind card with a $1-million limit at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen said consumers who use their Visa cards in the next three months will 
automatically be entered into the national sweepstakes. The winner of the 
million-dollar card, to be picked in January, will be able to charge $200,000 a 
year over the next five years without being billed by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the gimmick is another reflection of the increasingly competitive 
nature in the credit card business. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has become more mature in that just about everyone has a credit 
card now," said Ben Palmer, who follows financial institutions for Arthur 
Anderson &amp; Co. in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"The market share is not increased by offering new cards but by enticing people 
who have cards already to use yours -- by lowering fees, lowering interest 
rates and offering sweepstakes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the average charge on a bank card increased to $63 
from $60 during the period studied and outstanding balances increased to an 
average range of $1,175 to $1,201 in 1988 from an average range of $1,083 to 
$1,105 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
But fewer Americans are letting their credit cards run up high interest rates. 
Cardholders are paying their bills more promptly.

GARDEN GROVE SHOOTING PROMPTS CALL FOR ACTION; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCILMAN REQUESTS A 3-CITY TASK FORCE WHILE NEIGHBORHOOD BRACES FOR 
RETALIATION 
</P>

<P>
In the wake of one of Orange County's bloodiest gang attacks, Garden Grove 
Councilman and former Police Chief Frank Kessler called Monday for the creation 
of a regional gang-suppression task force, as police tried to forestall another 
round of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"These gangs don't respect city or county borders," said Kessler at a Monday 
night City Council meeting. "I think we need to take a lesson from the 
formation of the countywide regional narcotics task force four years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Kessler's request took the form of asking City Manager George Tindall and 
Police Chief John Robertson to study the feasibility of establishing a unit 
that would coordinate the anti-gang efforts of Garden Grove, Westminster and 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now all the cities do their own thing," Kessler said. "They coordinate, 
but usually only after something like this happens." 
</P>
<P>
Even as Kessler spoke, a few blocks to the south in Santa Ana, another 
neighborhood braced for what residents worry will be retaliation for Saturday's 
shooting -- in which a teen-ager and a 4-year-old boy were killed and six 
others were wounded -- and county gang experts say that their fears are 
well-founded because of the viciousness of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that members of the 5th Street gang in Santa Ana committed the 
shooting against members of the 17th Street gang in retaliation for an earlier 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
All was quiet on 5th Street in Santa Ana on Monday, but residents fear that it 
is only a matter of time before there is more gang violence in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the violence, Phyllis Cabrera, her husband and their two children 
checked into a Garden Grove motel to spend the night. But other residents, 
accustomed to almost weekly shoot-outs, have resigned themselves to accept a 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is little we can do except lie low and hope that we're not shot," said 
70-year-old Ruby Coursey. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wright, supervisor of the Orange County Probation Department's gang unit, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll do the pay-back," said Wright, predicting a retaliatory visit to 5th 
Street by the 17th Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police on Monday re-interviewed witnesses to Saturday's shooting, 
in which gang members armed with automatic assault rifles drove down La Bonita 
Avenue in a pickup truck and opened fire on a group of men, women and children 
who were on their way to the movie "Lethal Weapon 2." 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Miguel Lorenzo Navarro, 17, of Santa Ana, and Frank Fernandez Jr., 
4, of Garden Grove. Six others were wounded, including the 4-year-old boy's 
father, Frank Sr., and his 2-year-old brother, Christopher. Police said 
Navarro, a 17th Street gang member, was the target of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting spree occurred in the 13800 block of La Bonita Avenue, a 
working-class neighborhood of second- and third-generation Mexican-Americans, 
less than a block from Santa Ana city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police, aided by Santa Ana investigators, sorted through numerous 
tips and other information, much of it unsolicited from the community, but were 
not close to making any arrests Monday, Garden Grove Police Homicide Sgt. Phil 
Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making progress," Mason said. "We're pretty well certain what gang is 
involved. It's just a matter of sorting it out. There're a limited number of 
players involved." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are looking at several gang shootings "that go back a while" in 
connection with Saturday's attack, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly speculation," Mason said. "We're trying to sort out who the 
victims (of the earlier shootings) were." 
</P>
<P>
Kessler, who retired last year after 14 years as police chief, said he was 
shocked that "the worst gang shooting in the history of Orange County" occurred 
in his city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing that we several years ago devoted two full-time (police) 
personnel to keep track of gang activity," Kessler said. "However, it appears 
that no longer is a viable control technique." 
</P>
<P>
Virgil Coursey, 71, who has lived with his wife, Ruby, in a two-bedroom house 
at the corner of 5th and Maxine streets for 40 years, has more immediate 
concerns than whether a regional gang task force is formed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're expecting a holy war here," said Virgil Coursey, who said the 17th 
Street gang "will not stop until they kill a couple people here." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents of the area said the neighborhood had previously been the 
target of rival gangs, adding that the violence started again about six months 
ago, with gunplay a common occurrence on weekend nights. 
</P>
<P>
The first signs of renewed violence in the neighborhood came a few weeks ago, 
when gang graffiti painted on buildings on the corner of 5th and Euclid were 
crossed out by large black Xs, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, a prominent 5th Street gang member known as "Speedy," was 
gunned down by 17th Street rivals, residents said. "Speedy" was released from a 
hospital a few days ago, said Phyllis Cabrera, his aunt, who declined to 
provide his full name. 
</P>
<P>
But Speedy's mother said a reports that Saturday's drive-by attack was the 5th 
Street gang's revenge for her son's shooting were mere speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"They are only guessing," she said. "They only want an excuse to come back here 
and kill innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
Still, residents expect the 17th Street gang to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been going on for the 19 years I have been living here," said a 
42-year-old mother of two who asked that her name not be used. "And it isn't 
going to go away soon." 
</P>
<P>
On the same night Speedy was shot, trigger-happy gang members riddled Virgil 
and Ruby Coursey's house with bullets. Three bullets pierced the aluminum 
siding on one side of their house; another bullet crashed into a sewing machine 
inside the house. Ruby Coursey saved the fragments from the bullet and showed 
it to reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear the noise of the trucks revving their engines, and then you hear 
'tat-a-tat-a-tat,' " said Coursey, clicking her fingers to describe the 
automatic gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The gang members also sprayed Cabrera's house with about 15 bullets. Her sons 
have covered up the holes with plaster. Cabrera denied that her sons are 
involved in gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
Tung To, a 23-year-old Vietnamese immigrant who moved into the neighborhood 
five years ago, said it sometimes "sounds like Vietnam during the war." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't come out of the house, and we mind our own business," he said. "We 
don't want to complain." 
</P>
<P>
Ruby Coursey said she has begged her husband to sell the house they have owned 
for 40 years and move to another neighborhood. But Virgil Coursey says he 
doesn't think that they could afford a house somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Coursey looked across Maxine Street at a newly painted white house that a 
Vietnamese family had just bought. 
</P>
<P>
"They are in for a rude awakening," he said.

Elizabeth Brown's war chest in her battle to keep urbanization out of one of 
the last natural coastal canyons in Southern California is a set of dusty file 
cabinets stored in her Laguna Canyon home. 
</P>
<P>
The ammunition, Brown said, consists of thousands of documents that chronicle a 
decade of opposition to the Laguna Laurel Planned Community, a 2,150-acre 
project being developed by the Irvine Co. at the mouth of Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing to me that they want to build something there, right in the 
middle of the greenbelt," said the biologist, who is president of Laguna 
Greenbelt Inc., a nonprofit advocacy group formed to preserve a greenbelt 
buffer zone around the city of Laguna Beach. "The site is the keystone to the 
greenbelt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stepping Up Lobbying 
</P>
<P>
With a county-sponsored public meeting scheduled Wednesday evening in Laguna 
Beach to provide information on the project's environmental impact study, city 
officials and local environmental activists are stepping up lobbying for 
preservation of the Laguna Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Laguna Greenbelt Inc. members and other foes of Laguna Laurel set up 
a weeklong picket line near the Newport Beach home of Irvine Co. Chairman Don 
Bren. On Monday, about 20 pickets demonstrated in the canyon, where the Irvine 
Co. proposes building 3,200 homes, apartments and condominiums, a shopping 
center and an 18-hole golf course along Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Greenbelt officials said the picketing, scheduled to continue along the 
canyon highway this week, was organized to draw attention to Wednesday's 7 p.m. 
meeting at El Morro Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach officials and local environmentalists argue that the 2,150-acre 
site in unincorporated county territory is a valuable natural resource for 
county residents and should be preserved as a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the Laguna Beach City Council, which has hired an expert to review the 
voluminous environmental impact report, is expected to take another step to 
block the planned community. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Verna L. Rollinger said the council will consider hiring Laguna 
Greenbelt Inc. to write, print and mail out flyers in opposition to the plan, 
to be mailed to residents in communities adjoining the project area, including 
Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills, Leisure World and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's study session, local residents will hear consultants describe 
the findings of the recently released environmental impact report, officials 
said. The session marks a new phase in the lengthy permit process for the 
Irvine Co., which first announced plans to develop the community in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two October Hearings 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Planning Commission has scheduled two public hearings in 
October on the development, Irvine Co. project director Carol Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
The project could go to the Board of Supervisors as early as November. If it is 
given final approval, construction could begin by the fall of next year, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman on Monday expressed frustration at the strong opposition, saying 
company officials have repeatedly complied with residents' demands that open 
space be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
She also criticized environmental leaders and city officials for objecting to 
the project on environmental grounds at the same time that the city has been 
unable to stop many spills of sewage into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just incredible," Hoffman said Monday. "You don't see picketers out there 
on the beaches protesting the sewage spills." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that about 70% of the project would be reserved as open space: "It 
astounds me. I wonder if they (city officials) understand the extent to which 
the Irvine Co. has addressed the concerns of open space?" 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said that not only will Laguna Laurel provide housing for employees of 
commercial and industrial developments two miles from the canyon, but the 
project will include widening and other safety improvements for Laguna Canyon 
Road, which has been the scene of frequent traffic accidents. The city so far 
has blocked widening the road. 
</P>
<P>
"That road desperately needs to be upgraded," she said. "The project provides 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said the company has also revised its initial plans by moving all 
housing into the northern section of the project area, which is bounded on the 
north and west by Irvine, the south by Crystal Cove State Park and Laguna Beach 
and the east by Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
The project also encompasses Laguna Lakes, a three-lake system that will be 
donated to the county for a regional park, according to Irvine Co. documents. 
</P>
<P>
She said the revisions were made, in part, because of complaints that too much 
open space was to be developed under the original plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very responsible project," Hoffman said. "What (opponents) 
don't understand is that the Irvine Co. has given up the best part of the land 
to open space. It's a reasonable proposal." 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists who oppose the project said the Irvine Co. has not been 
attentive to public will. 
</P>
<P>
"We've shown that there is great opposition" to the Laguna Laurel project, 
Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Lida Lenney said during a protest last week. 
"People have been voicing their opposition for 10 years, and the county has not 
listened." 
</P>
<P>
The Greenbelt group has sued the county over the Board of Supervisors' 
tentative approval of the project in a 1986 development agreement. A Superior 
Court judge ruled against the environmental group, which had alleged that the 
agreement was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
But an appeal is pending before the state Court of Appeals, said Michael H. 
Remy, a Sacramento attorney representing the Greenbelt group. 
</P>
<P>

SAN CLEMENTE MAYOR TO SEEK A REVIEW OF ONOFRE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing his concern over atomic plant safety, San Clemente Mayor Brian J. Rice 
said Monday that he will ask the City Council to review a controversial report 
on the environmental impact of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation with the nuclear power station is something that should concern 
the city," Rice said. "Its effect on the environment will have an effect on us 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The power station is four miles south of the city in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said he will ask the council on Wednesday to review a 15-year, $45-million 
study of San Onofre's impact on the ocean environment. The study, performed by 
three biologists appointed by the California Coastal Commission and released 
last week, says the nuclear plant has done some damage to the ocean area but 
doesn't pose a major environmental threat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assurances Are Doubted 
</P>
<P>
However, Rice said he had doubts about the report's broad assurances about the 
plant's overall environmental safety. He said by putting the environmental 
report on the council agenda, council members can discuss it and consider 
inviting plant officials to San Clemente to answer questions about 
environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been constantly reassured that these things are safe," Rice said. "But I 
think the record of nuclear generating stations is less than reassuring about 
their being a safe method of providing energy." 
</P>
<P>
San Onofre opened its first generator in 1968 and now has three nuclear 
reactors designed to produce about 2,625 megawatts of electricity. Operated by 
Southern California Edison Co., the plant is capable of producing about 21% of 
the utility's total electrical output for the 50,000-square-mile service area 
from Kern to San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Zero Radiation' 
</P>
<P>
"We have used very sensitive radiation tests around the plant, and we've found 
almost zero radiation caused by the plant," said Byron Mechalas, the utility's 
manager for environmental research. Mechalas said San Onofre poses no health 
hazard to humans and has a very small impact on the sea environment. 
</P>
<P>
The biologists' study said the nuclear station has killed about 21 million tons 
of fish a year and has reduced the amount of kelp in the ocean. Because the San 
Onofre reactors are cooled through a procedure that draws water through the 
plant at almost 2 million gallons per minute, fish often get sucked into the 
pipes. And after cooling the reactors, the water is returned to the ocean at a 
higher temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically they're talking about 21 tons of fish, and that's a lot of fish," 
Rice said. "Then there's the effect on the kelp. So now there's danger to fish 
and kelp, and it makes me wonder what will be next. These people keep telling 
us there is no health hazard from a nuclear generating plant. But these people, 
from the very first, said nuclear generating plants are safe, efficient and 
low-cost, and they've been wrong on all three counts." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his Rosemead office, Mechalas argued that the 
biologists' study confirms that the San Onofre plant has caused little damage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kelp Reduction 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the biggest kelp beds down there in 25 years," Mechalas said. "The 
report only said that there was a reduction in what there might be in the 
amount of kelp." 
</P>
<P>
Mechalas agreed that 21 tons of fish are killed yearly because San Onofre 
water-cooling pipes pull in ocean water. But Mechalas said San Onofre uses a 
"fish elevator" system that saves 80% of the sea life pulled into the pipes. 
Mechalas said the system diverts most of the sea life from the pipes into a 
holding area and then elevates it to a higher water area, where another pipe 
pumps it back to sea. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the (San Onofre) plant is so small that if anybody didn't know 
the plant was there, he could never tell from inspecting the environment that 
there is anything different about that part of the coast," Mechalas said. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, however, said he is not convinced by Southern California Edison's 
reassurances. 
</P>
<P>
The council meeting will begin at 7 p.m. at San Clemente City Hall.

IRVINE WATER OFFICIAL PLANS RILEY CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a battle he readily admits is "uphill," Irvine water official Peer A. Swan 
announced that he will challenge incumbent Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, when the 
former Marine Corps brigadier general seeks a fifth term next June. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Riley, chairman of the five-member board, said in July that he 
would run, despite his age and asthma-related health problems that have 
necessitated hospitalization in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Swan, 45, said a key issue in the 5th Supervisorial District is development 
without adequate services, particularly roads. The district, which stretches 
from Costa Mesa to San Clemente and inland to Irvine and Laguna Hills, boasts 
some of the worst traffic congestion in the county, Swan said, and he holds 
Riley accountable. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a terrible situation that has happened on his watch," said Swan, 
treasurer of Newport Beach-based Pacific Scientific Co., a diversified 
manufacturing firm. 
</P>
<P>
Swan, an Irvine resident and unsuccessful congressional candidate in the 40th 
District a year ago, conceded that Riley, with his influence and long standing 
in Republican circles, can raise "10 times" the campaign money Shaw can. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have to figure that every motorist who gets snarled at the El Toro Y, is 
a potential Peer Swan voter," predicted Swan, referring to the junction of the 
Santa Ana and San Diego freeways. He also said, if elected, he would open a 
South County office, believing that it is unfair to ask those in need of county 
assistance to "wade through traffic" to reach the Civic Center complex in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Swan is president of the Irvine Ranch Water District board of directors and has 
been active in varied civic and GOP organizations.

BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB TO REOPEN AT NEW SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Brea Boys and Girls Club will reopen later this month when a temporary 
building is moved to a small lot owned by the city. The club was forced out of 
its former facility because of building rehabilitation at Laurel Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 boys and girls are awaiting the opening of the new center. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility, a 1,200-square-foot building on Sievers Avenue, will be used 
until a permanent location can be found. Dick Guthrie, executive director of 
the Boys and Girls Club, said the Sievers Avenue address would be rented from 
the city for $1 a year on a three-year lease. He said the club will add some 
amenities, including a fence and some landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Activities scheduled for the new site, which should open later this month, 
include computer education, arts and crafts, sports and group activities. Also 
planned is a reading program, along with tutoring and homework assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie said discussions are under way with the Brea School District for the 
club to use a new gymnasium and other facilities being built at Brea Junior 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
In its four separate sites, 3,000 boys and girls belong to the La Habra-Brea 
clubs.

MARINE JAILED AFTER CAR CHASE, ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Marine stationed in El Toro was in jail Monday, suspected of drunk driving 
after he rammed his car into a vehicle carrying four children while fleeing 
police, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan McKinney, 20, was held on suspicion of reckless driving, drunk driving 
and assault with a deadly weapon, Tustin police said. No serious injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Russell Whitehead said he tried to pull McKinney over for reckless 
driving at the intersection of Newport and McFadden avenues Sunday night. 
McKinney fled, leading the police on a chase southbound down the Santa Ana 
Freeway, Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
During the chase, Whitehead said, McKinney tried to ram the police car and 
eventually struck a station wagon, carrying Melanie Moeller and four children, 
as he exited the freeway. Moeller's car was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The chase ended when McKinney's car flipped over in a graded, gravel area where 
Jamboree Road dead-ends into an agricultural field, and the car caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was extinguished immediately, and McKinney was taken to United Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana, even though he was not seriously injured.

WITH RAIN, IT MIGHT AS WELL BE FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES ROBBINS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A typical fall day in Southern California has weather that can keep even the 
most skilled forecasters guessing -- sunny and warm until you wash your car, 
then cold and rainy. But even though fall has not really come, the rain has. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports of isolated sprinkles in Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, El Toro 
and other parts of Orange County early Monday, and forecasters were predicting 
wind and rain -- and possibly even hail -- by early today. 
</P>
<P>
Atmospheric pressure is falling and "things are moving right in," said 
meteorologist Bill Hibbert of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times. Hibbert said the condition was the result of a storm system that had 
slipped away from the Gulf of Alaska and hit California at San Francisco. The 
tail of the storm was expected to reach Southern California late Monday night, 
Hibbert said. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hundredths of an inch of rainfall recorded in Newport Beach Monday was 
not much, but then, rainfall is relatively rare for the month of September, 
Hibbert said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on data since 1951," he said, "this is quite a bit of rain for this time 
of year. Usually, there is only one day with measurable precipitation in 
September." Over the weekend, Hibbert said, many cities in the state got the 
amount of rain average for the whole month. 
</P>
<P>
The record rainfall for September in Orange County was set on Sept. 25, 1939, 
when 4.82 inches fell in Placentia during a devastating storm. (On Sept. 21 of 
that year, 3.74 inches fell in Anaheim.) 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday afternoon, a total of 0.07 inches of rain had fallen in Santa Ana 
since July 1 of this year. The normal amount for the period is 0.25 inches. 
</P>
<P>
The rain could turn into hail because of the coldness of the present 
low-pressure system, said Bill Hoffer, a specialist with the National Weather 
Service. Air temperatures, however, have remained moderate -- ranging from 
highs of 67 degrees in Newport Beach to 75 in Anaheim and San Juan Capistrano 
-- because the system is in the upper part of the atmosphere, 15,000 to 40,000 
feet, Hoffer said.

GROUP GAINS AN ALLY IN FIGHT TO PROTECT PENDLETON FROM ORANGE COUNTY'S SPRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attempt by a volunteer urban-planning and environmental group to protect 
Camp Pendleton from private development, both for the sake of wildlife there 
and so it will continue to be a buffer against Orange County's suburban sprawl, 
has won at least one supporter in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has said he will introduce legislation to preserve 
the area as open space by requiring that, "if and when the United States Marine 
Corps ever vacates" any or all of the 125,000-acre base, the land will remain 
under federal control and be dedicated as a national park or wildlife preserve 
for several endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal was met with apprehension from the Marine Corps and was 
criticized by another member of San Diego's delegation in Washington, who 
believes it would be counterproductive to the goal of keeping the base under 
federal ownership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packard Opposes Bill 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes the sprawling base, said 
through a spokesman that he opposes Bates' bill because of its mere suggestion 
that Camp Pendleton might one day be abandoned by the military. 
</P>
<P>
Packard "doesn't feel there's any need for this kind of legislation," said 
David Coggin, his chief of staff. "He has long said that Camp Pendleton will be 
a Marine base well into his great-grandchildren's lifetime. If we start doing 
bills like this, it gives people the notion that maybe it should be closed. It 
would establish a fait accompli to developers or others who want to put an 
airport there. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressman is very adamant that he would not introduce, and would not 
support, legislation in this regard, because it's totally unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
Bates' reply is: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand his logic at all. The bill makes it clear that the base 
would not be developed with residential, commercial or industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate anything ever happening to Camp Pendleton, and I don't 
think this bill is a signal that we're pushing them out. But, given the 
changing military needs in our country, if, in the distant future there should 
be a change, we want to be ready for it. This bill simply lays the groundwork 
to ensure that this land remains in public hands, for use as a park and for 
wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swath of Development Feared 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is sought by the San Diego group Citizens Coordinate for 
Century 3, or C3, which fears that the forces of rampant growth are so great in 
Southern California that, in time, corridors between San Diego County and the 
counties of Riverside and Orange will be a continuous swath of housing tracts 
and commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
The group maintains that Camp Pendleton is both a physical and psychological 
barrier in preventing the so-called Los Angelization of San Diego and a 
worst-case scenario that all of Southern California may one day become an L.A. 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Don Wood, president of C3, said last week that he is delighted by Bates' 
proposed legislation and confused by Packard's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are already piecemeal attempts by developers and others to pull out 
pieces of the base -- for oil drilling, for toll roads, for airports," Wood 
said. "The base has an entire office dedicated to encroachment problems like 
these. 
</P>
<P>
"If this bill passes, then anytime the Marines declare any portion of the base 
as surplus, it would not be available for developers to rip off for private, 
commercial development. Passage of the bill would decrease the number of 
attempts to encroach there. It strengthens, not weakens, the Marine position, 
because it takes away the incentive for private interests to try to rip the 
base off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Like the Marines' 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make it very clear that we like the Marines being there. They have 
the current ability to keep developers off their land because they have guns. 
But what if the Marines ever do leave?" 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he hopes that Packard "will turn around when he sees the value this 
bill would have to the Marines, whom he purports to support." 
</P>
<P>
Today, San Diego County Supervisor John MacDonald, whose North County district 
includes Camp Pendleton, will ask other board members to adopt a generic 
resolution echoing Bates' position on the base's future. 
</P>
<P>
Bates himself has not decided when he will introduce the bill; in the meantime, 
he is circulating drafts of it to environmental groups for reaction. 
</P>
<P>
He said some environmentalists have told him that it is not worded strongly 
enough and that it should stipulate that Camp Pendleton automatically become 
national parkland or a wildlife preserve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backed Down on Wording 
</P>
<P>
Bates said he backed down from the stronger wording in favor of first calling 
for a review by the Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton, which stretches along 17 miles of oceanfront and backs up 10 
miles inland to Cleveland National Forest and the Santa Margarita Mountains, is 
the only base in the country where Marines can simultaneously practice 
amphibious assaults, troop maneuvers and bombing runs with live ordnance. 
</P>
<P>
The base is also a host to a herd of 50 bison and such endangered birds as the 
California least tern, the light-footed clapper rail, Belding's savannah 
sparrow, California brown pelican and the least Bell's vireo.

A small plane failed to gain altitude after takeoff Monday and crashed in 
flames a mile away between a hotel and an office complex, killing both people 
aboard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cessna 182 Skyline was registered to a Santa Ana man but the identities of 
the pilot and the passenger were not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses said it never really gained altitude," Inspector Richard Carpenter 
of the Consolidated Fire District said. "It hit the ground, flipped and caught 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from Buchanan Field at 11:21 a.m. and crashed on Orion Road 
near Burnett Avenue and Galaxy Way. 
</P>
<P>
"All I saw was black smoke and flames," said Yvonne Wilbraham, who works in the 
nearby Galaxy Building. "People in our office heard a loud noise, looked up and 
saw a plane. It's scary. The airport's right in our back yard."

WRESTLING FOR LIFE;

<P>
OBA WON'T LET BOUT WITH LEUKEMIA DETER HIS DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brandon Oba isn't looking for shortcuts or special favors. He wants only one 
thing -- a letterman's jacket for wrestling at Brea-Olinda High School -- and 
wants to earn it through hard work. 
</P>
<P>
Oba, 16, found out last year that he has chronic leukemia, a fatal cancer of 
the blood that is progressive and curable only by successful bone-marrow 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The disease has made him want to reach his goal all the more. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm not going to be here forever," Oba said, "so I can try and do what I 
have only had dreams of. Like I had only dreams of my letter jacket. I figured, 
well, maybe. . . . But once I found out, it seemed more and more apparent that 
obviously this is something I really wanted. This is something I can achieve in 
my life. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first couple of months, I sat down and thought, 'You know, this 
isn't going to get in my way.' I can still function as a human being. I don't 
feel any real pain except in my joints. (And) you learn to bear the pain 
because it's just one of those things. Guys (have) got to overcome obstacles," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's one thing that matters in this world, it is getting my letter 
jacket before I graduate. That's one thing that I really wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say life expectancy is between three and five years after diagnosis 
without successful transplants. Oba's one chance is a marrow transplant. And 
today is the third day of a three-day donor drive at Brea Community Hospital, 
organized for Oba and another high school student with leukemia, Anissa Ayala 
of Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, transplants are done with a relative whose blood tissues match the 
patient's. But because no one in Oba's family qualifies as a match, the search 
has gone public. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his disease, Oba refuses to be bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not me?" he said. "Would it have been any better if my brother (Travis) 
got it? I couldn't handle it. When I got it, my family was in a shambles. 
</P>
<P>
"Same with my best friend. I wouldn't know how to react," Oba said. "No one 
wants it. There's no way I can sincerely ask, 'Why me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Oba hadn't participated in high school sports other than physical education 
classes before he decided wrestling would be his best chance to earn a letter. 
His joints can't handle long-distance running, and his knees can't take the 
pounding of playing basketball. So he tried wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
"You wrestle in a big circle, how far can he run?" said Oba, who competes at 
145 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
When he went out for wrestling last year, Coach Ed Bonilla consented. Then, Oba 
told him about the leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned for a minute," Bonilla said. "I didn't know he could still 
wrestle and have leukemia. My question to Brandon then was, 'Will it affect 
your wrestling?' " 
</P>
<P>
Apparently it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Oba was 12-4 with the junior varsity last season, was seeded first at the 
league meet and was named the team's most improved and most inspirational 
wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I'd wander in and check everything out, because it sounded OK," he 
said of his first day with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"The team had just gotten together, and they had been practicing for about an 
hour and a half, and I see all these guys wearing sweats and they're just 
dripping and soaking, wringing out their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of nervous at first . . . But I figured if I really put my heart 
into it, I could accomplish my goal." 
</P>
<P>
Oba insists he's a typical teen-ager. But he's taking five advanced placement 
classes in school. He's a member of the National Honor Society. 
</P>
<P>
And when he's away from school, he likes to go four-wheeling with his friend, 
Howie Voeltz, in the truck his parents bought him this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the same person as he was before he got leukemia," Voeltz said. "He still 
likes to go out and do stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget one time this summer when we went to Mammoth after he first 
got his truck. We decided to go up in the hills, but when we got to this one 
big hill, he got all worried. 'I'm not going to be able to make it up,' he 
said. But he backed up about 50 feet and went for it. 
</P>
<P>
"As we got closer to the top, he started saying, 'Come on. Come on. You can 
make it,' to the truck. When we got to the top he gave me a look of relief that 
he made it, that I'll never forget," Voeltz said. 
</P>
<P>
Oba is struggling to make the varsity team this year. He'll earn a letter after 
competing in five matches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very likely he'll wrestle a lot of varsity this year," Bonilla said. But 
it will be tougher than last year because most varsity wrestlers have more 
experience than Oba. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been easy. There are times when Oba can't do it, when he has to be 
carried out of practice to catch his breath because of allergies and asthma. 
</P>
<P>
"But after he cools down, he'll be right back in there," Bonilla said. "He 
doesn't want it (special treatment). He wants to be treated like anyone else on 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
"He's never used (his disease) as a ploy to get out of something," said his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
In a second-round match at the league finals last year, Oba suffered a severe 
mat burn on his right shoulder and was pinned. Some expected him to forfeit his 
next match for third place, but he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
He wrestled with his arm taped to his body to keep his shoulder from moving. He 
pinned his opponent in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
"That's his personality," Bonilla said. "He just doesn't give up." 
</P>
<P>
Oba said he's never felt bitterness about his situation or questioned why he 
got the disease. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, who both work in medicine, have helped him deal with the illness. 
His father, Steve, is a special-procedure technician and his mother, Karen, is 
an X-ray technician. 
</P>
<P>
"But we still didn't know what it'd mean to our family," his mother said. "(I 
reacted) like any parent who found out something was wrong with their child. It 
was upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to not let this affect us too much and go on with our life." 
</P>
<P>
Oba has the same philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"It (death) scared me before, but now, it's like it's going to happen. I've 
come to terms with my life and I think everything's OK. I'm moving forward," 
Oba said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Bonilla), I'm just one of the guys. I'm not going to let leukemia get 
in the way of what I want to do."

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER TEAM JUST KEEPS WINNING AT HOME, BY GEORGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Fullerton soccer team lately has taken to calling its home field 
"the Danger Zone" -- in reference to a three-year home unbeaten streak of 15 
games against conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a little something for the Titans to take pride in after finishing 
7-11-2 last year, the worst season in Al Mistri's eight years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
But after a 1-0 upset of 16th-ranked San Diego State Sunday -- at home, 
naturally -- the Titans have something else to be proud of. Adam Lehner's goal 
gave the Titans a victory and a 4-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the Titans are beginning to think of contending for the Big West 
Conference title, which they tied for in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Steve George, a junior who was one of the team's scoring leaders last season, 
was a redshirt freshman on the 1986 team. He shared in the championship 
officially, but because he didn't play, it didn't feel like his own. To make 
matters more frustrating, he missed out on another championship that season -- 
his former high school team, Mater Dei, won the Southern Section title in its 
first season after his graduation. A younger brother, Sam George, now playing 
at UCLA, was on that Mater Dei team. 
</P>
<P>
Now Steve George would like a title to call his own. He scored five goals and 
assisted on three last season and already is one of the points leaders this 
season. In five games, he has one goal and two assists, tying him for second in 
points with Lehner. Forward Rick Biedler, with six points, leads the team. 
</P>
<P>
George feels good about this season. It feels like a new start to him, not 
least of all because the Titans have new uniforms, complete with matching 
sweats. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we go out looking good," he said. "You know what they say, 'when 
you look good, you play good.' I'm very confident we're going to do well." 
</P>
<P>
If Mistri finds fault with George, it is because he says George plays a bit too 
much with his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"He could be more economical," Mistri said. "His heart gets in the way of his 
brain, and he just goes and goes and goes. . . . He goes all out. He runs now, 
and thinks about it later." 
</P>
<P>
George knows about this tendency and he is trying to play a more structured 
game. Still, all heart or not, he made first-team all-conference last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to play my way," George said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing his way is one way to distinguish himself from his brother, Sam, who 
Steve says plays in a more structured, skillful style. But even though they 
play differently, people frequently confuse the two. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been called Sam pretty often," Steve said. 
</P>
<P>
With five boys in the family, all of whose names begin with S, he's been called 
a few other things as well -- Scott, Seth and Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
The family has a solution. 
</P>
<P>
"They call us all George." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gene Murphy is defending quarterback Dan Speltz, who has thrown nine 
interceptions in three games. He blamed Speltz for only one of four 
interceptions Saturday -- but "it was an atrocious one," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy blamed another on a receiver, another on Speltz being hit as he threw, 
and said still another was a close call as a Fullerton player and Colorado 
State player came down with the ball together. 
</P>
<P>
Bad numbers and all, Murphy is standing behind his quarterback. Positive 
reinforcement is a must, he says. So, apparently, is keeping a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"We never say, 'Don't throw an interception. Don't fumble,' " Murphy said. 
"That's not positive reinforcement. We say, 'Make sure you throw to the right 
color jersey. Squeeze the football.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 4-9 touchdown-to-interception ratio, Speltz doesn't seem to be in any 
danger of losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
That is in part because the Titans -- who play at San Diego State on Saturday 
-- have no one to turn to. His backup, junior Paul Schulte, has virtually no 
experience. In one appearance last season, Schulte didn't attempt a pass and 
carried once for a loss of three yards in a 58-13 victory over San Jose State. 
Schulte attempted two passes in the late going Saturday, completing one for 12 
yards . . . and throwing an interception on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarterback, for emergency use only, is Tony Dill, who started at 
quarterback late in the 1985 season but was converted to a receiver last year. 
But the offense has changed substantially since Dill last played quarterback. 
For him to play, the Titans would have to radically alter the offense. 
</P>
<P>
The final quarterback on the team, a promising freshman named Terry Payne, is 
scheduled to redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
Volleyball player Susan Herman, who had 36 kills in two matches last week, 
ranks eighth in the country in hitting percentage.

SUIT OUTLINES HOW LINCOLN ALLEGEDLY GENERATED PHONY PROFITS FOR PARENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hidden Valley Ranch, 8,576 acres of undeveloped land southwest of Phoenix, is 
largely barren and, as its name implies, difficult to reach. 
</P>
<P>
But what was hidden from most observers was not so much the valley as the way 
that its owner, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, allegedly used the land to generate 
phony profits from fraudulent transactions, according to the $1.1-billion 
racketeering lawsuit federal regulators filed last week against Charles H. 
Keating and other former operators of the Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The bogus profits boosted the amount that Lincoln forwarded to its parent, 
American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, ostensibly to pay its share of corporate 
taxes, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
The tax-sharing plan was one of the major ways in which the parent firm 
allegedly drained Lincoln funds to fuel American Continental's speculative real 
estate deals and enrich its owners, the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders benefited, the suit alleges, from excessive loans made by Lincoln to 
companies they controlled and from American Continental's stock value, boosted 
by the unusually healthy financial results Lincoln was posting with inflated 
revenue. Keating sold some of his stock in 1987, for instance, for $3.3 
million, which was in addition to his $2-million salary. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental filed 
for bankruptcy, saying the S&amp;L was was being operated in an unsafe manner. 
Experts predict that Lincoln will be the nation's costliest S&amp;L bailout, 
costing taxpayers up to $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-sharing plans allow a subsidiary to send its share of taxes to its parent, 
which pays the entire tax bill for the holding company and all subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lincoln's arrangement with its parent, the suit alleges, Lincoln funneled 
federally insured deposits into a series of questionable deals that created 
artificial profits -- and allowed the S&amp;L to ship a total of $94.8 million 
to its parent for taxes over three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Lincoln didn't have any taxable income for those years and, therefore, 
didn't owe any taxes, the suit claims. Nor did American Continental use the 
money that Lincoln forwarded under the tax-sharing plan to pay taxes, the suit 
alleges. "The true but hidden purpose of the arrangement was to allow ACC to 
siphon funds from . . . Lincoln for the enrichment of ACC," Keating and his 
family and associates, the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
The Hidden Valley deals, as well as other transactions cited in the suit, also 
helped Lincoln get around regulations designed to limit its ownership interests 
in real estate and securities, the suit claims. Because the transactions were 
shams arranged by insiders, the suit states, Lincoln never really sold its 
investments and still controlled those assets. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for American Continental would not comment on allegations in the 
suit, saying the company would make its response in court. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate executives previously denied all wrongdoing, specifically stating 
that loans and sales Lincoln made were not contrivances to hide unlawful direct 
investments. They have said repeatedly that regulators had spent the last four 
years reviewing their records and even approved some transactions. Nothing in 
the lawsuit, one spokesman said last week, comes as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Loans Defaulted 
</P>
<P>
A Lincoln subsidiary bought the vacant Hidden Valley land for about $28.6 
million and, from October, 1986, through June, 1988, sold three-quarters of it 
in the 10 transactions. It recorded a profit of nearly $82.1 million, which 
resulted in $31 million being sent to American Continental for taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The transactions characteristically involved "straw" men who borrowed the 
entire purchase price directly or indirectly from Lincoln to buy the property, 
the suit said. And Lincoln assumed the risk of possible losses because the 
borrowers were allowed to limit their risk of default to the property itself, 
the suit said. All the loans defaulted, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
In one of those transactions, Ernest C. Garcia went to Keating and his 
associates for a loan early in 1987 to buy the remaining stock in a Phoenix 
real estate development and investment banking firm, according to the lawsuit. 
Garcia already owned 20% of what is now called E. C. Garcia &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
A major condition for providing the loan, however, was Garcia's agreement to 
buy or arrange for the purchase of a 1,000-acre parcel of Hidden Valley for $14 
million, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia could not or would not buy the parcel, but he arranged for 
Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp. to buy the parcel and satisfy 
Keating's demand, a requirement that allegedly violated federal law. 
</P>
<P>
On March 30, 1987, Lincoln loaned Garcia $20.2 million. While Garcia used a 
"significant" portion of the loan to buy Garcia Co. stock, the suit alleges, he 
also loaned Westcontinental $3.5 million on the same day for that company's 
down payment on the Hidden Valley property. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Westcontinental borrowed $10.5 million from a Lincoln 
subsidiary for the remaining amount owed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Appraisal 
</P>
<P>
The loan was a nonrecourse loan, which means that the S&amp;L could not go 
after any other Westcontinental assets except the Hidden Valley parcel in case 
of default. And there wasn't much there to seize in any event, the suit claims, 
since Westcontinental had only $87,000 in total assets. Westcontinental, 
moreover, was required to make only annual payments, and no payment ever was 
made, the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln subsidiary provided the $10.5 million loan even though an appraisal 
three days earlier had concluded that the parcel was worth $8.5 million, 
substantially below the sale price and the loan amount. 
</P>
<P>
Through "accounting gimmickry," the suit said, Lincoln improperly logged its 
gain from the Garcia/Westcontinental sale, causing the S&amp;L to overstate its 
1987 income by nearly $11.1 million. Lincoln forwarded $4.4 million to its 
parent as its share of the taxes on those profits. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that S&amp;Ls cannot sell property they own, finance 100% 
of the transactions and immediately record profits. Yet Lincoln and its 
subsidiaries typically provided all funds for purchasers, the suit alleges, in 
one of five ways: 
</P>
<P>
* They funded loans to third parties who then turned over the funds for the 
down payment to a purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
* They guaranteed loans that a purchaser obtained from others to make down 
payments, and also paid loan fees charged to the straw purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
* They bought other property from the purchaser at the same time they sold 
property to the purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
* They funded lines of credit to the purchaser at about the same time they sold 
property to a purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
* They agreed to repurchase the property or exchange it for other Lincoln-owned 
property.

SANTA ANA FIRM TEST-MARKETS PHONE ANSWERING MACHINES FOR HOTEL ROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As if telephone answering machines in the office and home weren't enough, now a 
Santa Ana firm thinks hotel guests should have them in their rooms as well. 
</P>
<P>
EECO Computer, which makes computerized hotel management systems, has added a 
new feature to its system that enables hotel guests to use their room telephone 
as a personal answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
EECO is touting the feature as a way for hotel guests to avoid the aggravations 
of having to check with the front desk for messages. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is human intervention in a message system, there is a tremendous 
opportunity for error," said Gerald N. Soma, EECO's vice president of 
marketing. "Messages are lost, or sometimes there is something that is lost in 
translation." 
</P>
<P>
Soma said the answering system also guarantees that a guest's messages remain 
private. "That's a serious issue with a lot of business people," he said. "The 
information being transmitted might be of a confidential business nature." 
</P>
<P>
EECO is test-marketing the hotel answering system at hotels in Toronto and 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
With the system, each hotel telephone serves as a personal answering machine 
for the guest. Guests record their outgoing messages, callers leave their 
messages, and the guests can retrieve the messages when they return to their 
rooms. Guests can also retrieve their messages from remote locations. 
</P>
<P>
EECO will initially focus its marketing efforts on large, full-service hotels, 
Soma said. He declined to specify how much the system would cost to install in 
an average-size hotel. Compiled by David Olmos, Times staff writer

MAI Basic Four Inc. said a partnership controlled by New York investor Bennett 
S. LeBow has completed its previously announced plan to invest $55 million in 
MAI Basic Four, a financially strapped Tustin computer maker. LeBow is chairman 
of MAI. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Brooke Partners LP will give MAI $30 million in cash and will 
invest another $25 million in a new class of MAI stock with restricted voting 
rights. Additionally, Brooke has agreed to guarantee some loan payments for MAI 
through Sept. 30, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the investment, Brooke will get new common stock that will give 
it 54% of MAI's shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
MAI said that in order to allow shareholders to preserve their equity 
positions, it intends to offer non-transferable rights to purchase, on a 
pro-rated basis, 17.5 million common shares at $3.54 a share. MAI said it 
expects to hold the offering by March 30, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
MAI reported a loss of $46.2 million and a 23% decline in revenue, to $86 
million, for its third quarter ended June 30. The company attributed $25 
million of that loss to expenses related to its unsuccessful bid to acquire 
Prime Computer Inc., a Natick, Mass., firm, in a protracted takeover battle 
that ended in August. Compiled by David Olmos, Times staff writer

DANCE DUO STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning, Bardeux was a musical marketing concept in search of a comely 
embodiment. 
</P>
<P>
The concept belonged to Jon St. James, the Orange County record producer best 
known for his work with Stacey Q. 
</P>
<P>
St. James' thinking wasn't exactly revolutionary, but events have proven it 
sound: if you could find a couple of stylish, sexy-looking young women, give 
them a peppy dance rhythm to shake and shimmy to and some light, catchy 
melodies to sing -- well, the idea had sales potential. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bardeux's debut album, "Bold As Love," produced one Top 40 hit, 
"When We Kiss." Two other singles from the album did well on the dance charts. 
Now "I Love to Bass," the first single from Bardeux's new album, "Shangri La," 
is moving up both the pop and black music charts. 
</P>
<P>
Concept vindicated. But concept-embodier a little resentful -- at least when it 
comes to the less-than-respectful reception Bardeux gets from some beholders in 
the music press. 
</P>
<P>
"The resentment's there only when people come up to me and give me ignorance," 
said Stacy Smith, a former Cal State Fullerton political science major who is 
better known to Bardeux fans as Acacia, the fair-haired half of the concept. 
"Don't try to treat me like some kind of bimbo, 'cause I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Smith came off sounding intelligent and self-possessed as she spoke on 
the phone last week from St. James' studio in La Habra. She and her new singing 
partner, Melanie Taylor, had been preparing for a Bardeux blitz that included 
shooting a promotional video for "I Love to Bass," and a national tour that 
begins Thursday night at Carnivale, a dance club in Smith's hometown of 
Fullerton (the tour has Bardeux headlining a bill of Enigma Records acts that 
also includes Japanese singer Hiroko and April Wayne, a swimsuit model whose 
first record is being produced by St. James). 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a good-looking girl to begin with, you're going to be dealing with 
that your whole life," Smith said of the "bimbo" stigma. In Bardeux's case, any 
such stigma would seem to be amplified by the fact that the concept calls for 
the duo not only to look good, but to sing songs that typically emphasize a 
kittenish, dance-floor seductiveness. 
</P>
<P>
But even that quality deserves some respect, Smith said. "As far as being sexy, 
that has to come from within. You can't just put that on." 
</P>
<P>
Smith points out that she has her share of creative input as lyricist and takes 
an active role in promoting Bardeux's business interests. It's not a case, she 
insists, of a pair of passive pop starlets having their career orchestrated by 
a producer-as-Svengali. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many girls out there who are producer puppets. They want to lump 
Bardeux in that. But a producer can only do so much. When you get up on stage, 
there's nobody holding your hand up there and if you can't carry your own 
weight, you're going to sink." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 24, was carrying breakfast trays at Coco's restaurant in Brea when St. 
James, one of the regulars, decided that his waitress had the look and 
personality to make her Bardeux material. 
</P>
<P>
"When he finally asked me if I could sing, I didn't know who he was," recalled 
Smith, who is now St. James' girlfriend as well as his musical collaborator. 
"Who was this slimy guy saying he would make me a star? I took two friends to 
the audition as chaperones. I wasn't going to go by myself until I found out he 
was legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Until that point, Smith's only pop-music experience had come as singer in "a 
really terrible garage band" that never had performed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always a fantasy-type thing for me to think about being in the music 
business," she said. "But I never took it seriously enough until the 
opportunity landed in my lap. It's something I probably wouldn't have knocked 
myself out to get," she admitted. But, she says, opportunity brought with it a 
determination to work hard. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's first partner in Bardeux, Jaz, was recruited on the strength of a demo 
tape. The singers had a similar vocal quality: the thin, girlish tone that has 
marked most female dance-pop generated in Madonna's wake. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Smith says, Jaz decided that she would rather have more time 
for a personal life than keep up Bardeux's pace as dance-pop careerists. Smith 
found her replacement singing in one of the rock-oldies revues at the Hop in 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed Melanie in the show. I was really impressed that night after night, 
although she was doing the same show, she had a smile on her face," Smith said. 
"She had a conviction about the business." Taylor, 26, also had a good, 
breathy-but-full-bodied singing voice, somewhat like Diana Ross'. It enabled 
Bardeux to achieve more vocal contrast on "Shangri La" and to explore funkier, 
R&amp;B-oriented material. Smith thinks the fact that Bardeux is now an 
interracial duo may have helped it to get its first play on black radio 
formats. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that on my own, a middle-class (white) girl from Orange County 
would have been accepted on the black charts," she said. "But (choosing Taylor) 
was never a question of was she black or was she white. I just hit it off with 
her and she was the best qualified." 
</P>
<P>
The songs on "Shangri La" offer a surface sheen of catchiness and an energetic 
dance pulse, but the themes and lyrics are tried-and-true love-and-lust stuff 
that shows little individuality or depth. So far, Bardeux remains more a 
commercial concept than a vehicle for interesting or meaningful expression. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a stack of notebooks with lyrics," Smith said. "I have lots of songs 
that have nothing to do with 'Honey, kiss me' or 'Let's go out and dance.' But 
right now I'm doing pop music. If they want to buy something serious, let them 
get that from Tracy Chapman. I don't think they want to hear that from Bardeux. 
I think I've written a really good song about child abuse, and another about 
pollution and apathy, but these are things I don't think are right for this 
particular project." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that Bardeux would like to change is the fact that its shows -- 
including the coming date at Carnivale -- are sung to prerecorded music rather 
than with live accompaniment. These "track shows," in which the use of backing 
tracks renders the supposedly live singing suspect as well, are common in 
dance-pop circles. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get to ad lib the way a true live performance would be," Smith said. 
"That's something Melanie and I look forward to doing. The live situation is 
always the best and we're working toward that. At this point it's more 
cost-effective to do track shows. It would be wonderful to have a band." 
</P>
<P>
Smith says her transformation from a college student waiting on tables between 
classes to a dance-club glamour object has not drastically changed her material 
circumstances. She still lives at home with her parents in Fullerton when 
Bardeux isn't on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"To dispel any myth that you're making millions as soon as you're on the radio, 
I did buy myself a new car on the first album (earnings), but I'm not exactly 
rolling in dough," she said. "My parents are still very helpful when I need it. 
I'm waiting for the big check." 
</P>
<P>
Bardeux, Hiroko and April Wayne play Thursday night at 10 at Carnivale, 1401 S. 
Lemon St., Fullerton. Tickets: $8. Information: (714) 441-1666.

A group of 100 signed photographs by Ansel Adams will receive their first 
public exhibition at UC Irvine, beginning Jan. 6. The prints -- of UC campuses, 
research stations and agricultural units -- were commissioned in 1963 by 
then-UC President Clark Kerr to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the UC 
system. 
</P>
<P>
During a four-year period, Adams took more than 6,000 photos for the project. 
The works in the exhibition were chosen from the final 605 images Adams 
selected for the celebration. Although the campus political scene of the 
mid-'60s precluded most centennial fanfare, the photographs were published in a 
1967 book, "Fiat Lux: The University of California." 
</P>
<P>
"The Museum Set," a group of 75 photographs by Adams, also will be shown in the 
exhibit. The portfolio is owned by Pacific Telesis Group.

FULLERTON LIBRARY SPOTLIGHTS CHILDREN'S BOOKS SPANNING MORE THAN THREE 
CENTURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside, freight trains rumble by and laundry dries on the porches of modest 
apartments. But tucked in a corner of Fullerton's Hunt Branch Library, there's 
a magical watercolored world -- a place where daring knights woo doe-eyed 
ladies, swashbuckling pirates brave the bounding main and a gentrified terrier 
and tomcat keep shop. 
</P>
<P>
These colorful characters and dozens like them hold court in two small but 
engaging exhibits of historic children's literature, "The Big Three -- and One 
More" and "Brandywine School," on view at the library through Sept. 30. Curated 
by City Librarian Carolyn Johnson, the books were selected from the Fullerton 
Public Library's Mary Campbell collection, which includes more than 500 
English-language children's books spanning three centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Started in 1926 by children's librarian Mary Laura Campbell, the collection was 
adopted in 1969 by Fullerton's Friends of the Library and has since been 
expanded through their funding and through individual donations. According to 
Johnson, the earliest book in the collection is a 1659 edition of "Orbis 
Pictus" (Latin for "Picture World"), an English-Latin "picture encyclopedia" 
said to be the first European children's book that combined illustrations with 
text. It was, in a sense, the great-granddaddy of "Dick and Jane." 
</P>
<P>
"The author had this revolutionary idea that children would learn better if 
they were amused, so he started using the illustrations," Johnson said. "It was 
in print for at least 200 years." Other highlights of the collection include an 
1860s "McGuffy Reader" and a first edition of Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn," 
Johnson added. 
</P>
<P>
Although she can't put a price on it, Johnson said the value of the collection, 
and the popularity of historic children's books, has risen dramatically in 
recent years. While the Mary Campbell collection may not be the Southland's 
largest or most valuable gathering of children's books (UCLA's Department of 
Special Collections, for example, has more than 25,000 volumes), it is among 
the most accessible. Literature buffs, student groups and even John Q. Book 
Lover can use the collection just by making an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to be able to examine them closely," said Johnson, who directs 
access to the collection and organizes an ongoing series of exhibits and 
lectures on the topic. "As far as I know, in Orange County this is the only 
collection that has been specifically designed to assist students of children's 
literature." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Big Three -- and One More," viewers meet English writer-illustrators 
Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott and Kate Greenaway, three 19th-Century 
pioneers of children's literature who, with printer Edmund Evans, popularized 
the modern picture book; as well as Beatrix Potter, whose menagerie of woodland 
charmers are as popular today as they were in the early 1900s. "Brandywine 
School" features works by Howard Pyle, author-illustrator of "The Merry 
Adventures of Robin Hood" and "The Book of Pirates" (modestly billed on its 
flyleaf as "Fact, Fiction and Fancy Concerning the Buccaneers and Marooners of 
the Spanish Main"). Works by Pyle students Maxfield Parrish, Jessie Wilcox 
Smith and N.C. Wyeth, best known for his illustrations of 18 "Scribner 
Illustrated Classics," also are on display. 
</P>
<P>
Such books take the reader back to a gentler and perhaps imaginary time when 
men were valorous and ladies were prone to flirtations and the vapors. In 
Howard Pyle's "The Story of the Champions of the Round Table" (1905), for 
example, the bold Sir Tristam -- never one to drag his feet -- barely meets a 
fair widow before he's off "seeking the knight of yonder castle to do battle . 
. . in behalf of that lady whose lord he slew so treacherously." 
</P>
<P>
Romance also blooms in "Come Lasses and Lads," a delightfully illustrated verse 
in Randolph Caldecott's "The Panjandrum Picture Book" (1885) in which roguish 
fellows and dainty maids engage in G-rated dalliances: 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, after an hour, they went to a bower, 
</P>
<P>
 And played for ale and cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 And kisses too -- until they were due, 
</P>
<P>
 The lasses held the stakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatrix Potter's "Ginger and Pickles" (1909) and a unique fan-folded edition 
of "The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit" (1906) both feature Potter's trademark 
critters, snappy dressers all, who consistently manage to be incredibly 
endearing but never too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
"Ginger and Pickles" is the tale of a shop-keeping terrier and tomcat who are 
high on courtesy but low on business sense. After extending credit to all 
comers, the genteel pair are forced to throw in their aprons and close up shop. 
Ginger moves to rabbit Warren and becomes "stout and comfortable"; Pickles 
finds a new career in games-keeping. The villagers, a charming jumble of 
porcupines, field mice and other woodland folk, are at sixes and sevens until 
Sally Henny-penny (an enterprising hen who insists on cash but is "otherwise 
quite harmless") reopens the shop. 
</P>
<P>
Other books on display include an 1878 edition of Walter Crane's "The Baby's 
Bouquet," touted on the flyleaf as "a fresh bunch of old rhymes and tunes," and 
George MacDonald's "At the Back of the North Wind" (1919), which features 
richly colored, soft-focus illustrations by Jessie Wilcox Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big Three -- and One More" and "Brandywine School" continue through Sept. 
30 at the Hunt Branch Library, 201 S. Basque Ave., Fullerton. Hours: Monday 
through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Also on exhibit 
through Oct. 31 are abstract oil paintings by Argentine artist Jose Cosenza.

LAGUNA ART MUSEUM SHARES THE TALENT OF DEAF PAINTER WITH THE HEARING-IMPAIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Painter Granville Redmond achieved a rare feat within his field: He supported 
himself most of his life through his art. But in doing so, he won an even 
greater battle: Redmond, who earned prominence among early 20th-Century artists 
with landscapes of the Golden State, from fiery sunsets to ethereal moonlit 
marshes, was deaf. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum, exhibiting the first major survey of works by Redmond 
(1871-1935) through Nov. 19, is making an effort to share his talent with the 
deaf community by offering docent tours of the 76-piece show accompanied by 
interpreters for the hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"We elected to do this exhibit based on the quality of the art, not on the fact 
that Granville Redmond was deaf," museum director Charles Desmarais said 
recently. "But the fact that he can serve as a role model for deaf people is 
something we are aware of and pleased to pass on to new audiences." 
</P>
<P>
The museum, which is offering free, interpreter-assisted tours by appointment, 
is coordinating its effort with such service organizations as Orange County 
Deaf, Greater Los Angeles Deaf (providing the interpreters) and the National 
Center on Deafness based at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which primarily helps hearing-impaired students "mainstream" into 
the university, is publicizing the tours and arranging a group tour and 
transportation for anyone who is interested, said the center's director Victor 
Galloway, who is deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"Many deaf people can easily identify with Redmond, a graduate of the 
California School of the Deaf," said Galloway through an interpreter during a 
phone interview Monday. "And deaf people are excited that one of their own has 
achieved acclaim." 
</P>
<P>
Redmond, born in Philadelphia, was left deaf from scarlet fever at age 2. He 
never learned to speak. In the late 19th Century, the deaf were widely 
considered uneducable, if not retarded. But Redmond's parents entered him in 
the highly regarded California School of the Deaf, then located in Berkeley and 
now in Fremont, where he learned sign language, mime, and first studied art. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating, he went to Paris on a scholarship. There, his paintings were 
well-received. A haunting work titled "Matin d'Hiver," included in the Laguna 
Beach exhibit, was accepted into the Salon des Artistes Francais, and he was 
awarded a salon prize. But after an attempt to win even greater recognition 
failed and he had tired of a life of penury, he returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Redmond eventually regained his confidence and soon was making a living for 
himself, his wife and three children by painting, though for a while he 
supplemented his income by working as a mime in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
Influenced by French Barbizon and Impressionist masters and such American 
artists as George Inness, Redmond draws upon both the muted quality of tonalism 
and Impressionism. Traveling up and down the California coast from Marin County 
to Laguna Beach, he captured sun-drenched slopes ablaze with orange poppies, 
restful pastoral scenes, the misty, early morning fog. 
</P>
<P>
"He achieved a prominent place among the best artists of California with his 
paintings that expressed the silence and solitude he felt" as a deaf person, 
writes curator Harvey Jones in the catalogue to the exhibit, organized by the 
Oakland Museum. 
</P>
<P>
(Few people appear in Redmond's paintings, a fact that Jones speculates also 
relates to the artist's deafness.) 
</P>
<P>
Redmond was particularly fond of Laguna Beach and, indeed, exhibited a work in 
a seminal exhibit that led to the formation in 1918 of the Laguna Beach Art 
Assn., the progenitor of the Laguna Art Museum. Three paintings in the current 
exhibit are part of the museum's permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
Though other museums regularly offer such services, the Laguna Art Museum's 
interpreter-assisted tours for the deaf are its first, said Desmarais, who 
confessed that they aren't strictly an altruistic gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"All museums today are trying to find ways to expand their audiences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the tours may be an ongoing feature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get a good response to this," he said, "there's no question." 
</P>
<P>
 "Granville Redmond" continues through Nov. 19 at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 
Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Hours: Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Admission: $2 for adults, $1 for students and senior citizens. To make an 
appointment for a free docent tour with an interpreter for the hearing 
impaired, call the museum at (714) 494-8971. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit coincides with International Deaf Awareness Week, Saturday through 
Sept. 30.

LAVERA GETS 58 YRS. IN KILLING OF SANTA ANA CHURCH ELDER, L.A. MAN FOR BEER 
MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reputed gang member was sentenced to 58-years-to-life in prison today for two 
slayings, including the murder of a Santa Ana church elder who was gunned down 
as he prayed in a telephone booth. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge J. Michael Byrne gave Todd Lavera, 25, the 
maximum penalty for being an accomplice in the first-degree murders of Leopoldo 
Salgado of Los Angeles and David Eugene Thompson, an elder of the Greater Zion 
Apostolic Church in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 27, and Salgado, 48, were shot to death within 90 minutes of each 
other in South Central Los Angeles on April 9, 1987, during an attempt by 
Lavera and two other men to obtain money to buy beer. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne also ordered Lavera to pay $10,000 each to the Salgado and Thompson 
families as restitution. The Thompson family is from Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Lavera, who was not the triggerman, had faced a maximum penalty of life in 
prison without the possibility of parole, but Byrne reduced the punishment 
saying there was not enough evidence presented during the trial to show that 
Lavera intended to kill Thompson and Salgado. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a Superior Court jury recommended that Lavera be given a life sentence 
after finding him guilty of a special circumstance allegation, murder during 
the commission of a robbery. The charge qualifies the defendant for the death 
penalty or life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was shot and killed in a telephone booth at Slauson Avenue and 
Broadway. Police said he had gone for help after a church bus broke down. As 
his wife, Namora, waited in their car, three men robbed them of $10 and shot 
Thompson as he prayed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the men then took the Thompsons' car and drove to a liquor store 
where they bought beer and cigarettes. They returned to the store later and 
shot Salgado to death when he and his friend refused to give them money. 
</P>
<P>
Still awaiting trial for first-degree murder and robbery is Tracy Lavell 
Carter, 21, of Los Angeles. Andre Moore, 19, earlier pleaded guilty to the 
first-degree murder of Thompson and was sentenced to 32-years to life.

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HOMELESS IN WAKE OF HUGO

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Hugo spun toward the Bahamas today after thrashing Puerto Rico with 
125 m.p.h. winds, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless throughout the eastern 
Caribbean. An official reported at least 25 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo hit northeastern Puerto Rico and then skirted its populous northern coast 
Monday. It roared on to the northwest and toward open water, its 
hurricane-force winds missing the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
At midday today, the hurricane's center was east-northeast of Grand Turk Island 
in the southern Bahamas, according to the National Weather Service. Winds fell 
to 105 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Likely to Hit Mainland 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said it likely would hit the U.S. mainland later in the week but 
said it was too early to predict where. Cruise ships steamed out of the way, 
residents prepared along the North Carolina coast and Florida residents jammed 
the phone lines of insurance companies for financial protection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long way from any potential landfall," said Bob Sheets, director of the 
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables, Fla. "Unfortunately, the 
higher likelihood is that it will turn more west and could make landfall 
anywhere from south Florida to North Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo has left a trail of smashed homes, power failures and injuries in 
Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua and the Virgin Islands since Sunday, and 
widespread looting by machete-wielding mobs was reported on the island of St. 
Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Sailboats were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feet on shore in St. 
Thomas, and some waterfront businesses have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup efforts were under way today throughout Puerto Rico. Gov. Rafael 
Hernandez-Colon said at least 27,900 people were left homeless and asked 
President Bush to declare it a disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo's winds overturned cars, peeled roofs off houses and office buildings and 
sent chunks of concrete plunging into streets in San Juan, where one-third of 
the U.S. commonwealth's 3.3 million people live. 
</P>
<P>
The winds ripped out glass, walls and furnishings from the top four floors of a 
25-story building in the Santurce section, leaving only beams remaining.

A DC-10 jetliner carrying 154 people from the Congo to Paris disappeared today 
shortly after taking off from a stopover in Chad, the French airline UTA said. 
</P>
<P>
The flight originated in Brazzaville, Congo, and had made a stop in N'Djamena, 
Chad, the airline said. Contact was lost with the aircraft shortly after 
takeoff and there was no indication of the plane's fate more than five hours 
after contact was lost, UTA said. 
</P>
<P>
UTA Flight 772 was carrying 140 passengers and a crew of 14, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
The last radio contact between the plane and air traffic controllers, about 20 
minutes after leaving the airport at N'Djamena, indicated everything was 
normal, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said there was no unusual weather in the area. It did not say what 
search measures were being taken. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, purchased by UTA in 1973, had logged 60,000 hours in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Chad was long the scene of battles between government forces and 
Libyan-backed rebels, but has been calm for the last two years. Chad and Libya 
have restored diplomatic relations and agreed to settle their territorial 
dispute at the border by peaceful means.

The British Foreign Office minister responsible for Hong Kong said today the 
only solution to a massive influx of Vietnamese boat people into the colony is 
to send them back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Maude, minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, said 
Britain is negotiating with Vietnam on a program to send back tens of thousands 
of boat people living in the colony's cramped refugee camps. "We are working 
very hard to find a lasting solution which can only involve the sending back to 
Vietnam those people screened out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 55,000 Vietnamese are languishing in the colony's overcrowded detention 
centers. More than 32,000 Vietnamese have sailed into Hong Kong so far this 
year.

The former president of Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison today for defrauding the school of more than 
$3.4 million, including $39,000 spent on furniture for his home. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Hibbs, 59, asked for a community-service sentence, but U.S. District Judge 
Ralph Thompson said the former university president had had his chance at 
public service and "you exploited it." 
</P>
<P>
Hibbs was convicted of giving students on scholarship no-show jobs instead of 
paying them out of a scholarship fund. He then diverted money from the fund to 
friends and relatives and bought a trailer and furniture for his home, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbs repaid the money taken from the fund by putting family members and others 
on the state payroll in jobs that required little or no work and having their 
salaries deposited into the scholarship fund.

Nine Hungarian border guards have been accused of taking advantage of the East 
German immigrant exodus by charging refugees money to help them flee to the 
West, state news media said today. 
</P>
<P>
The MTI news agency quoted the military prosecutor's office in the western 
Hungarian town of Gyoer as saying the guards had, in exchange for "significant 
sums" of money, helped East Germans across the border sometime after Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the guards have been arrested and the other four have been taken off 
border patrol duty, MTI said. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, officials in West Germany said about 700 more East Germans had 
arrived in the past 24 hours from Hungary, bringing the total of refugees 
arriving since Hungary opened its western border Sept. 11 to nearly 17,000.

CHINA'S DENG LAUGHS OFF DEATH REPORTS

China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping today laughed about foreign reports of his 
death and said China is unafraid of Western sanctions in the wake of the June 
crushing of pro-democracy unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, 85, also told Japanese lawmaker Masayoshi Ito that among the politicians 
he most respected were former President Richard M. Nixon, Henry A. Kissinger 
and Japan's former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. All three men led the way in 
improving their countries' relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the Great Hall of the People was the second for China's 
reclusive leader in three days. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in public for the first time in three months Saturday when he held 
talks with Chinese-American physicist T. D. Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Deng's re-emergence after the long absence has, for the moment, dispelled 
speculation that he is gravely ill with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The nationally televised evening news showed Deng walking unaided to meet Ito, 
whom he called "an old friend" as the two shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
Deng told Ito that criticism of China by the Paris summit of seven 
non-communist industrialized nations in July was "based on lies and 
distortions" and "too superficial." 
</P>
<P>
"China is not afraid of sanctions, which will rebound on those imposing them in 
the long run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deng added that China had noticed "some difference" in attitude between Japan 
and the other six countries. 
</P>
<P>
Japan joined Western nations in condemning Beijing's killing of demonstrators 
and an ensuing wave of arrests in June, but its criticism was less harsh. Tokyo 
put a freeze on new financial aid to China.

BUSH PRODS CONGRESS TO ACT QUICKLY ON CLEAN AIR PLAN

<P>
President Bush, declaring that "sound ecology and a strong economy can 
coexist," prodded Congress today to pass his legislation to clean up the 
nation's fouled air. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a riverfront celebration of Washington's 100th anniversary of 
statehood, Bush called upon "all Americans to join in a renewed spirit of 
conservation," including recycling their trash and generating less waste. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning that the President had originally planned to visit Prince 
William Sound, the site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, he spoke to a crowd on 
the banks of the once-polluted but now reclaimed Spokane River. 
</P>
<P>
With House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, the hometown Democratic congressman, at his 
side, Bush said, "When it comes to clear air, we need action on the legislation 
we've proposed -- now." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who sent the clean air bill to Capitol Hill on July 21, said, "Every day 
that passes is another day we're postponing progress on clean air. . . . Now it 
is up to the Congress to pass this clean air legislation this year." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has been sparring with the Democrat-controlled Congress over drugs and 
other issues, but Foley told reporters Monday he expects Congress to send Bush 
a clean air bill to his liking either late this year or early in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be an achievement for both the Congress and the Administration," Foley 
said. The plan now is in House and Senate subcommittees. 
</P>
<P>
Bush proposed a 10-billion-ton reduction in acid rain-producing sulfur dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000, a 2-million-ton reduction in nitrous oxide and a 
40% cut in other emissions that cause urban smog. His plan also calls for use 
of alternative fuels in 1 million vehicles by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and their allies in Congress have criticized the goals as too 
modest and say the plan would leave too much to the discretion of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and in some cases to the affected industries. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, winding up a two-day swing that also took him to centennial celebrations 
in South Dakota and Montana, said the "majestic" Spokane River "has been 
reborn" from its once-polluted state, a symbol of the nation's environmental 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I took this trip out West because I'm concerned . . . about the future of the 
planet we share," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today I'm asking all Americans to join in a renewed spirit of conservation, a 
new commitment to a more careful stewardship of the natural world." 
</P>
<P>
Bush called for applying "the creativity of the marketplace in the service of 
the environment. Sound ecology and a strong economy can coexist."

Most of United Airlines' 24,000 non-union employees face a 10% pay cut if the 
$6.75-billion employee buyout of parent UAL Corp. goes through as planned, it 
was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Sun-Times, quoting an unidentified adviser to the buyout group, 
said the pay cut will apply to managers and most salaried workers. The 
lowest-paid clerical workers will not be affected, nor will employees in one or 
two fields requiring highly specialized skills and training since those workers 
could easily find comparable jobs with another airline, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout plan, which would make UAL the biggest employee-owned U.S. company, 
calls for employees to own 75% with management owning 10% and British Airways 
PLC holding 15%. The pilots have already said they would take pay cuts of up to 
10% as part of the plan.

International Business Machines Corp. today announced a system for writing 
computer programs with the help of computer programs. 
</P>
<P>
The world's biggest computer company held a news conference to announce its 
commitment to "computer-aided software engineering," which is intended to make 
software more reliable and faster to develop. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 companies expressed support for IBM's blueprint, demonstrating 
IBM's influence in the computer business. 
</P>
<P>
Disorganized writing of software has led to sprawling, patched-together, 
unmanageable programs that take up valuable programmers' time and stall 
innovation. The problem has become so acute that corporate chief executives are 
pressing their computer chiefs for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
"The real driving force behind our industry is that we have got to figure out 
how to build better software, faster," Kim Addington, vice president for 
marketing at KnowledgeWare Inc. in Atlanta, said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of tools for computer-aided software engineering already total about $300 
million a year, even though fewer than 10% of customers are even dabbling in 
it, according to CASE Research Corp. of Bellevue, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
CASE Research expects sales to start jumping about a year from now when 
software toolmakers have brought their products into line with IBM's de facto 
industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
At least five years will be required to achieve largely automatic programming, 
but IBM's commitment at least legitimizes the concept of it, consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said it will come out next June with a "repository," a library containing 
the information that all the different software engineering tools need to do 
their jobs. Strict rules will ensure that all toolmakers structure their 
information in a consistent way.

Australian brewing and investment magnate Alan Bond sought respite today from 
his huge debt load with a multibillion-dollar deal to sell half his brewing 
business to New Zealand's Lion Nathan. 
</P>
<P>
But financial analysts were skeptical whether the deal would succeed after 
earlier debt-relief plans from Bond have failed. "If it goes ahead, it may buy 
Bond breathing space," said broker Nestor Hinzack of Burdett Buckeridge and 
Young in Sydney. "But that is a big 'if.' " 
</P>
<P>
An elaborate chain of takeovers, acquisitions and approvals from stock market 
watchdogs and shareholders will be required before the deal is done. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Perth-based Bond Corp. will sell its Australian breweries 
to a new venture company for $1.9 billion. Lion Nathan and Bond would end up 
with equal shares of the new company, Australian Breweries.

A late bout of selling sent stock prices tumbling just before the closing bell 
despite good news on the inflation front that had kept prices firmer during 
much of the session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 0.19 to 2,687.31. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, 
with 712 issues up, 709 down and 532 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 141.61 million shares, against 136.94 million in 
Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index edged up 0.03 to 192.46. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.67 to 378.83. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened higher after two new economic reports suggested that 
inflationary pressures had eased further during August. But although blue-chip 
stocks gained, the broader market lagged behind, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said the data -- the Labor Department's report that the 
consumer price index remained unchanged in August at 0.2% and the Commerce 
Department report that housing construction fell 5% in August -- suggested an 
easing of inflationary pressures and added to hopes that the Federal Reserve 
would loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Junk Bond Rally 
</P>
<P>
Although institutional trading was light, selling by institutions early in the 
afternoon wiped out some of the market's earlier gains. The market showed some 
confidence after a rally in the junk bond market on the heels of Canadian 
retail giant Campeau Corp.'s announcement that it had secured a $250-million 
loan to pay its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond prices had fallen sharply in recent sessions after word of Campeau's 
financial troubles raised concern about the viability of the high-yield, 
high-risk securities. Campeau had used junk bonds to finance recent 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
But late in the day, stocks retreated under pressure of a late bout of 
computer-driven program selling. Transportation and pharmaceutical stocks were 
among the few standouts in an otherwise featureless session, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose slightly today on a new government report showing the best 
performance in consumer inflation in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up 1/8 point, or $1.25 for 
every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield, which falls when its 
price rises, had declined to 8.07% from 8.09% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The market "had a good set of data this morning," said Mitchell Held, chief 
financial economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "We should have 
had a better reaction." 
</P>
<P>
In today's trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of 
short-term government issues were up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities had 
risen 1/32 point to 3/16 point, and 20-year issues had gained 1/8 point, 
according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information 
service.

INFLATION, HOUSING STARTS COOL IN AUGUST;

PRICES FROZEN AT JULY LEVEL; 5% DROP IN CONSTRUCTION

<P>
U.S. consumer prices and housing starts cooled in August, the government 
reported today, with retail inflation frozen at July's level and housing 
construction at a six-month low. 
</P>
<P>
The zero inflation figure was the first time that the Labor Department's 
consumer price index has not registered an increase since April, 1986, when it 
fell by 0.3%. The August performance was credited to a 4.2% plunge in gasoline 
prices, the steepest one-month drop in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Falling energy prices have given consumers three consecutive months of good 
news on inflation. Prices were up a modest 0.2% in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rises Early in Year 
</P>
<P>
This was in sharp contrast to the situation earlier in 1989 when steep hikes in 
gasoline and food led to a surge in prices and pushed the inflation rate up to 
an annual level of 6.7% for the first five months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But with the price moderation in the three months since then, consumer prices 
are rising at a more modest annual rate of 4.8%, up only slightly from the 4.4% 
increase for all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Construction starts of new homes fell by a sharp 5% in August, the largest drop 
in six months, the Commerce Department said. The figure surprised economists, 
who were expecting it to stay unchanged from July. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first decline since May for the housing industry, which had been 
among the sectors hardest hit earlier this year as the Federal Reserve drove up 
interest rates to slow economic growth and control inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Total housing starts during the first eight months of the year are down 4.7% 
from the same period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
While some economists say the country is in for moderation in inflation, other 
analysts are worried that underlying inflationary pressures are being masked by 
the plunge in energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
These economists say energy prices, which surged early in the year only to fall 
back somewhat in the last three months, are likely to begin rising again this 
fall, reflecting higher crude oil costs. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices shot up 21.2% in the first five months of the year, then fell 
1% in June, 2.2% in July and 4.2% in August. The August decline was the biggest 
drop since a 5.2% decrease in August, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Natural gas and electricity prices registered a 0.2% decline while heating oil 
costs fell by 0.9% last month.

Food prices rose a modest 0.2% in August following a 0.3% July gain. Those 
figures were in sharp contrast to the first nine months of the year, when the 
lingering effects of the 1988 drought sent food costs racing ahead at a 9.3% 
annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing costs fell a sharp 1.5% in August, helping to push apparel prices down 
by 3.4% over the last three months. The price drop was credited to larger than 
normal end-of-season price cuts for women's and girls' clothing. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury bond prices rose slightly after the reports were issued, 
reflecting reduced inflation concerns, but then pulled back to stand little 
changed from Monday's close.

The Federal Aviation Administration today ordered a detailed inspection in the 
fan disks of all DC-10 engines similar to the one investigators believe failed 
before this summer's Iowa crash landing that killed 112 people. 
</P>
<P>
FAA Administrator James B. Busey announced the formal inspections before a 
congressional panel, where he and National Transportation Safety Board Chairman 
James Kolstad both declared the DC-10 jumbo jet safe. 
</P>
<P>
Busey said that although investigators had not determined what caused the 
explosive engine failure in the July 19 accident, they believe one possible 
scenario is the development of a crack in the fan disk "as the result of an 
internal flaw in the disk material itself."

SATURDAY'S FOE IS MICHIGAN; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS CAUTIOUS ABOUT FACING WINLESS TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA will face a winless team Saturday night. But Bruins Coach Terry Donahue 
believes it is a team that just as easily could be considered the best in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan certainly would be ranked No. 1 had it beaten Notre Dame last Saturday 
instead of losing a 24-19 decision to the Fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take two plays off the film, Michigan is the No. 1 team in the 
country," Donahue said, referring to Raghib (Rocket) Ismail's two kickoff 
returns for touchdowns. "But you can't take those two plays off, and that's to 
Notre Dame's credit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Question' 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, there's no question Michigan is going to win the football game 
(without the two plays)." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan was ranked second before losing to Notre Dame in its season opener. 
The Wolverines, now ranked fifth, will probably come to California in an angry 
frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it would have been easier for the Bruins to prepare for Michigan had 
the Wolverines beaten Notre Dame, Donahue smiled and said, "Our task, getting 
ready for Michigan, was going to be hard no matter how you cut the bread." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, ranked 24th, brings a 1-1 record into the nationally televised contest, 
which begins at 5 p.m. at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue realizes the Bruins have not been very impressive so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
After being hammered 24-6 by 14th-ranked Tennessee in their opener Sept. 9, the 
Bruins rallied for a 28-25 victory over 20-point underdog San Diego State last 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
He views Saturday's game as a test of character for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to be blind to not see what kind of a football team they have. 
Michigan is one of the top football teams in the country. I really view the 
Michigan game as an opportunity for our football team to step forward and show 
its colors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest concern I have about our football team right now is we must 
increase our intensity all over the field. We were more intense (against San 
Diego State) than we were against Tennessee. We stayed in the game and really 
competed for four quarters. I guarantee you we'll take a step forward this 
week." 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines will be without quarterback Michael Taylor, who was injured in 
the Notre Dame game. Coach Bo Schembechler will have to start freshman Elvis 
Grbac at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Both Good Athletes' 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said the switch probably will not affect the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both good athletes," Donahue said. "Grbac did an excellent job against 
Notre Dame. He doesn't run as well as Taylor but showed a lot of poise." 
</P>
<P>
"What it does, it cuts us down," Schembechler said. "We're going to cut back on 
what we're doing offensively. I don't want to put that kind of pressure on 
Elvis to be a Michael Taylor and know as much of our offense as Taylor does."

The Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania hope to achieve partial 
Olympic recognition by the 1992 Games and total sports freedom after that, the 
Latvian sports minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
The three republics, which had independent Olympic committees from the 
mid-1920s until 1940, now supply athletes to Soviet national teams. 
</P>
<P>
Latvia and its Baltic neighbors went to the Soviet sports committee in Moscow 
last December seeking autonomy and were rejected, Sports Minister Daumants 
Znatnajs said through an interpreter. But they returned a month ago and were 
told such a move would be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Znatnajs said he hopes that as a first step, Baltic competitors will have the 
name of their republic written beside the familiar CCCP (the Cyrillic letters 
meaning USSR) on jerseys at the 1992 Olympics. He also said the republics want 
to march under their own flags in opening and closing ceremonies.

Frank Pena and Raul Marquez, a couple of 1989 high school graduates, scored 
impressive victories for the United States today in first-round matches at the 
World Amateur Boxing Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Pena, 18, of Aurora, Colo., knocked down Peter Jacobsson twice and stopped the 
Swede in the third round of a 139-pound bout. 
</P>
<P>
Marquez, also 18, of Houston, outscored Javier Martinez of Spain 31-7 on 
punches scored under a new computer scoring system in a 147-pound match. 
</P>
<P>
Pena and Jacobsson threw left hooks almost simultaneously, but it was the Swede 
who went down. 
</P>
<P>
"Mine got there first," said Pena, who put the Swede down again with a 
combination to the body. 
</P>
<P>
Marquez connected often with head punches with both hands in beating Martinez. 
The left-handed Marquez, also a 1989 U.S. Amateur champion, forced the Spaniard 
to take standing 8-counts in the first and third rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The new computer scoring system, in which at least three of the five judges 
must push a button within a second of a punch for it to be recorded as a point, 
again made its presence -- or lack of it -- felt. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a malfunction, the first bout on the afternoon card was scored in 
the old way, with each judge awarding 20 points to the winner of the round and 
a lesser number to the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkor Kirkorov of Bulgaria won a 3-2 decision over Aydas Feyzolla of Turkey at 
125 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The computer was in service for the second bout, but one judge didn't realize 
it for about 30 seconds and another didn't know it for almost two minutes. 
Sandro Casamonica of Italy won the 125-pound bout 27-14 over Lee Hoon of South 
Korea.

New York Mets Manager Davey Johnson benched outfielders Darryl Strawberry and 
Kevin McReynolds today for leaving the dugout during Monday night's 10-6 loss 
to the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say I was disappointed in a couple of peoples' actions and this 
will give them time to think about it," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody would give details, but apparently what happened was the two went into 
the clubhouse Monday night and were not on the bench in the ninth inning when 
the Mets rallied for two runs and had the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry had to be called back when it was his turn to bat and he struck out 
for the final out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to them about it and told them what I expected and, obviously, I 
didn't get what I expected," Johnson said.
