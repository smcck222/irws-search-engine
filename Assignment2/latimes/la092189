The cloud hanging over spying suspect Felix Bloch has cast its shadow over his 
wife, and she has resigned as executive director of a charitable foundation. An 
official of the American Austrian Foundation said that the FBI's investigation 
of the allegations against her husband had damaged Lucille Bloch's 
effectiveness on the job. No charges have been filed against Bloch, who has 
denied any wrongdoing. "Just imagine the terrible pressure and the problem she 
is having," said Thomas J. McGrath, a Manhattan lawyer who serves as the 
foundation's secretary. "I'm sure every time she turns around, they say, 'Oh, 
you're that man's wife.' " Bloch, formerly the No. 2 official at the U.S. 
Embassy in Vienna and a veteran of 30 years in the Foreign Service, has been 
under surveillance since June. The Justice Department began the probe after 
Bloch was photographed handing a briefcase to a suspected Soviet agent in a 
Paris restaurant, U.S. sources have said. The foundation, which is moving from 
Washington to New York, runs programs including fellowships in Austria for 
journalists and sponsors cultural events.

 -- They met to try and come up with a metaphor for our times -- something to 
rival the "Roaring '20s," the "Dark Ages," and the "Age of Enlightenment" -- 
but the task proved daunting. "Everybody was satisfied but no final metaphor, 
alas, emerged," Bernard Levin, chief columnist for The Times of London, said of 
the 60 intellectuals who attended the third annual Conversazioni on Culture and 
Society, in Boston. After dissecting political changes in the Soviet Union, the 
influence of religion on world events and cultural illiteracy, several 
conferees proposed metaphors. Levin, in his presentation, pointed to the drug 
epidemic and the collapse of form in the arts to coin the "Age of Disorder." 
American economist Walt Rostow talked of the European Community's plans for 
dropping border restrictions and suggested "Age of Regionalism." While neither 
was adopted, Levin applauded the attempt. "The whole idea is that we thrash out 
these things," he said.

 -- Former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are 
no longer being considered for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, a leading 
Norwegian newspaper reported. The Oslo-based Nobel committee makes no official 
comment on candidates for the award, but Norwegian media reports have proved 
accurate in the past. The panel is to name the peace prize winner on Oct. 5. 
The conservative daily Aftenposten said the five-member committee had ruled out 
Reagan and Gorbachev in a meeting this week. ANN CONNORS

Retired Navy Capt. Roland W. Faulk, 82, the chaplain who led the prayer during 
the surrender ceremonies aboard the battleship Missouri at the end of World War 
II. On Sept. 2, 1945 the Methodist minister offered the prayer during 
ceremonies aboard the ship in Tokyo Bay that marked the end of the war with 
Japan. The prayer, which is encased at the Douglas MacArthur Library in 
Norfolk, Va., called on the victorious Allies to show mercy toward the 
conquered Japanese. "But peace without justice we know is hopeless, and justice 
without mercy Thou wilt despise," the prayer read in part. Faulk, a native of 
Texas, joined the Navy in 1937 and was credited with recruiting about 1,500 
chaplains into the service. During his 30 years in the Navy, Faulk served on a 
number of ships and shore commands. He retired in 1967 as chaplain of the 11th

VOTERS SIGNAL MAJOR CHANGES IN THE WIND FOR CITY POLITICS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE CHEERED BY ELECTION RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just 10 months after four growth-control ballot measures were drubbed at the 
polls, jubilant slow-growth and environmental activists believe that Tuesday's 
election results place them tantalizingly close to achieving an environmentally 
conscious, managed-growth majority on the San Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The election of John Hartley, a former member of the Sierra Club's executive 
committee, coupled with the impressive primary victory of former Citizens for 
Limited Growth staffer Linda Bernhardt, offer the possibility of a sudden, 
dramatic reversal of the council's generally pro-growth stance, activists say. 
</P>
<P>
If Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer can hang onto her seat and Bernhardt's 
predictions of victory come true, the moderate to conservative Republican 
majority that has ruled the nine-member council on major issues would be 
replaced by a progressive coalition that includes Wolfsheimer, Councilman Bob 
Filner, Hartley and Bernhardt. Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who recently was named 
the council's top environmentalist by the Sierra Club, and Councilman Wes Pratt 
might be expected to supply key swing votes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Victory for Environmental Community' 
</P>
<P>
"I think that (Tuesday) night was an overwhelming victory for the environmental 
community," said Barbara Bamberger, conservation coordinator for the Sierra 
Club. Excluding incumbent Judy McCarty's race against unknown Kenneth Key, "in 
every district the environmental candidate was the top candidate." 
</P>
<P>
"All the talk that growth was a dead issue was dead wrong," added Filner. "It 
is the primary issue, and it will be the general issue." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of McCarty, who faced only token opposition in Key, 
candidates endorsed by the Sierra Club and Prevent Los Angelization Now -- the 
successor to Citizens for Limited Growth -- came out on top Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although crime was undoubtedly the top issue in Hartley's defeat of 3rd 
District incumbent Gloria McColl, growth, traffic, the environment and other 
attendant issues were top priorities in Struiksma and Wolfsheimer's races for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opponents Labeled 'Bulldozer Boys' 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Struiksma labored under the burden of his reputation as 
the council's most pro-growth member, while Wolfsheimer made the most of her 
environmental and slow-growth credentials, labeling her opponents the 
"bulldozer boys." Wolfsheimer was the only council member to break with her 
colleagues and support Citizens for Limited Growth's Proposition J over the 
council-backed, but generally less stringent, Proposition H. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is lost on development industry representatives, who now must 
decide whether to pour their ample resources into the campaigns of Struiksma 
</P>
<P>
and Bob Trettin, Wolfsheimer's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"Given last night, they (the environmentalists) have a shot" at ruling the 
council, said one building industry source who asked not to be named. "And are 
the builders worried? Yeah. And are the environmentalists worried that they 
won't get it? Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Filner, another council environmental leader, contends that developer money 
cannot make or break a candidate in the era of district elections as it did in 
November, when the building industry spent nearly $3 million to clobber two 
citywide and two countywide growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shown that it doesn't work," he said. "What works is the door-to-door 
walking and phoning." 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts note that nothing is certain on the nonpartisan council, where 
coalitions form and crumble with each major issue, particularly at a time when 
council members will be looking foremost to serving their districts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wolfsheimer and Bernhardt still face long climbs to victory. "I 
like our chances," Struiksma said. "I've had four people and an independent 
committee attacking me for months. Now it's down to a one-on-one situation. 
(Bernhardt's) been a one-issue candidate so far. The more people focus on her, 
the more they'll see how shallow her campaign is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Industry View 
</P>
<P>
"The bad news for Abbe," Trettin said, "is that this is the third time in four 
years she's failed to get a majority in her district. I'm going to do my best 
to make sure there's a fourth time." 
</P>
<P>
But another building industry representative predicted that developers will not 
lose sleep over a dramatic alteration of the council, because even builders' 
allies have made life generally burdensome for backers of development projects. 
In recent months, the council had increased the fees paid by builders and 
stepped up demands that builders finance construction of roads, parks and 
schools in newer parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be more difficult, but it can't get that much worse," the 
source said. "Contrary to the perception, it has not been a bed of roses." 
</P>
<P>
Even if just one of the two candidates is elected along with Hartley -- which 
would enhance the power of swing votes such as O'Connor, Pratt and perhaps 
Councilman Ron Roberts -- environmentalists and slow-growthers will have taken 
a major step forward from Nov. 8, when city and county voters rejected four 
growth-control measures at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
While activists continued to contend that the public wanted solutions to the 
problems of increasing traffic congestion, vanishing open space and crowding in 
schools, growth control faded from agendas at City Hall, particularly after the 
council passed a compromise approach authored by Filner and McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Much More Opportunity' 
</P>
<P>
"The sentiment has always been there," said Peter Navarro, chairman of Prevent 
Los Angelization Now. "It's just been a matter of coalescing it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it does signal that there's much more opportunity to move forward with 
an environmental agenda," that includes the cleanup of San Diego Bay and other 
issues, said Jay Powell, special projects director of the Environmental Health 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everyone following the environmental and slow-growth issues predicted 
that a new council majority would test O'Connor's true colors as an 
environmentalist as well as her leadership skills. Earlier this month, some 
environmental leaders met with O'Connor's staff to discuss the future of their 
movement in San Diego, and they plan to meet with with the mayor soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the mayor would see now that she can move more forcefully," 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's had the excuse that she hasn't had five votes," said Ron Ottinger, 
chairman of the Sierra Club Committee on Political Education. "If that excuse 
is no longer there, then the proof is really out there to be had." 
</P>
<P>
But Bamberger said environmentalists must generate popular support for an idea 
before O'Connor will embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
"The way she basically operates is, she's going to see which way the wind is 
blowing, and then she's going to follow up on that. That's the way she's always 
been, and that's the way she'll always be," Bamberger said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mayor may be criticized for the tacit support she appeared to 
give during the campaign to Struiksma and McColl, whom she appointed to highly 
visible posts as negotiators with county officials on funding for new jails and 
as members of the "disaster council" that sought $34 million in anti-crime aid 
from Gov. George Deukmejian. On Monday, the day before the election, she gave a 
speech during the council session denouncing a Bernhardt mailer that attacked 
O'Connor's Soviet Arts Festival and accused Struiksma of supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
"She was clearly helping the two, but it was clearly not effective help," 
Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt, who acknowledged being puzzled by O'Connor's apparent aid for 
Struiksma and McColl, said she would soon ask for a meeting with O'Connor to 
solicit her support. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to believe that, if she is who she says she is, she will be 
wholeheartedly supporting myself and Abbe, and working closely with John 
Hartley," Bernhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said Wednesday that she is not taking sides for now, but reserved the 
option to make endorsements later.

TOUGH POWAY LAW SETS STAGE TO PURGE CITY OF DRUG USERS, DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Poway City Council has launched an offensive to rid the city of drug users 
and traffickers by requiring landlords to evict tenants guilty of drug offenses 
and by preventing users from doing business in the city -- all in an effort to 
turn Poway into what officials claim would be the nation's first drug-free 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, passed unanimously Monday night, requires all landlords and 
managers of rental property within Poway to evict tenants found to be using or 
selling drugs on their rental property. 
</P>
<P>
Who would provide the evidence of such activity was left unsaid, but the 
ordinance specifies that the city attorney must present a written notification 
to the landlord that the city has reason to believe that the violations exist. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Stephen Eckis said the new law, which will take effect Oct. 19, does 
not authorize "witch hunts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Concrete Evidence' 
</P>
<P>
Eckis is charged with notifying landlords of their duty to evict tenants found 
to be using or dealing drugs, and said he will rely on "concrete evidence" and 
not simply suspicion before starting the city-initiated eviction process. He 
said he will know better what sort of evidence that entails after the law goes 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords face prosecution for misdemeanor offenses if they fail to act to 
evict offending tenants. 
</P>
<P>
But Shari Jones, a 32-year-old San Diego resident, charged that the Poway 
ordinance is designed to protect property values, not to wage a drug war in the 
North County community. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking as a lone voice opposed to the ordinance, Jones predicted that the 
local law will be challenged in court and overturned because it violates 
constitutional guarantees of civil rights and due process. 
</P>
<P>
She also warned that the law will discourage drug addicts from seeking 
treatment for fear of losing their lodgings, and will exacerbate the problems 
of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Jones called the law "an affront to common sense, an insult to decency" and "an 
emotional, reactionary response" to a complex problem. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jan Goldsmith, a promoter of the ordinance, pointed out that state 
laws already exist to penalize drug users and traffickers. Poway's local 
legislation, he said, is designed to force users to seek help, not to punish 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the Poway city attorney would present the written statement 
on suspected drug use to a landlord. The landlord would then be required to 
evict the tenant, filing notice of eviction and following up by taking the 
tenant to court to enforce the eviction. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords have said they favor the legislation because they feel drug users are 
detrimental to their property. 
</P>
<P>
Since Poway began considering the drug abatement law several months ago, other 
communities have followed suit. The San Marcos City Council has discussed a 
proposed ordinance patterned after the Poway law. Solana Beach and Chula Vista 
city officials also have requested similar ordinances from their city 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith and Councilwoman Linda Brannon were named to a council subcommittee 
to expand the Poway campaign against drugs even further by preventing drug 
abusers from obtaining permits from the city or doing business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Brannon told fellow council members that the city has "been too tolerant too 
long" toward drug abusers. She proposed to extend the city's "zero tolerance" 
toward drug users "the full spectrum" by: 
</P>
<P>
* Preventing drug users from obtaining contracts with the city for provision of 
goods or services. 
</P>
<P>
* Preventing drug users from obtaining contracts, licenses or permits to do 
business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
* Providing facilities for treatment of drug addiction within the city, 
amending zoning codes to provide a proper place for such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
These and other actions, Brannon said, will make Poway "a beacon that points 
the way to the President's drug-free America." 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith said the road to a drug-free city requires "more of a change in 
attitudes than a change in the laws." 
</P>
<P>
Eckis said he had no indications yet that the new drug eviction law will be 
challenged, but added that he does not expect opposition until the law has been 
put into practice. 
</P>
<P>
The eviction of tenants from rental units applies not only to single-family 
homes and apartments, but also to mobile home renters and tenants of 
recreational vehicles within the city limits.

Preliminary indications from an investigation into the pre-dawn collision 
Tuesday between two sportfishing boats carrying a total of 32 people point to 
operator error, the Coast Guard reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"When the weather conditions are clear, and the sea conditions are calm -- and 
there's a collision -- the normal presumption is that the operators were 
negligent," Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. David Tiffany said. "An investigation is 
being done to determine whether there are any other facts that may explain the 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
The collision between the 50-foot Temptress, which was carrying five passengers 
and three crew members, and the 65-foot Aztec, which was carrying 19 passengers 
and five crew members, occurred a little before 3 a.m. near the Coronado 
Islands, a popular fishing area. Three people suffered minor injuries, the 
Coast Guard reported. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a Coast Guard helicopter responded to a distress call about 8 
p.m. after a crew member on board a sportfishing boat got his hand caught in a 
hatch and severed several fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany said the accident occurred about 100 miles southwest of San Diego on 
board the Champ, operating out of Fisherman's Landing in Point Loma. He said 
the crew member, whose age and name were unavailable Wednesday night, was being 
flown to a hospital in San Diego.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The convicted killer of a former Los Angeles Rams football player was sentenced 
Wednesday to 44 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence given to George Cunnington, 27, of Spring Valley, also included a 
term for a second murder committed hours before he killed Rey Nicholas 
Phillinganes, the former football player. Phillinganes, 23, was shot about 7 
a.m. on Nov. 18, as he and his fiancee were leaving her apartment in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Cunnington tried to rob Phillinganes at gunpoint, and Phillinganes was shot in 
the chest as he tried to wrestle the gun away. 
</P>
<P>
The other victim, Robert Hetmer, 51, was shot to death in his ransacked, Spring 
Valley home, where Cunnington was also living. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Andrew Wagner imposed consecutive sentences for 
both murders. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Cunnington pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the death of 
Phillinganes, and second-degree murder in Hetmer's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the probation department, Cunnington said he accidentally 
shot Phillinganes. He said he encountered the former football player while 
under the influence of crystal methamphetamine, marijuana and possibly cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Cunnington maintained that the gun "went off" during the struggle for control 
of the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant also said he did not remember killing Hetmer, according to the 
probation department.

'STAR WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the thought of Dan Quayle ever holding the reins of presidential power 
has frightened many of us, I suspect we may have grounds for being encouraged 
now. The man must be proving himself more competent these days than we realize, 
or he wouldn't have been entrusted with the job of laying it on the line about 
the less than super "Star Wars" (Part I, Sept. 7-8). 
</P>
<P>
Although White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater mouthed obligatory disapproval 
of the term "political jargon" in regard to how President Reagan sold the 
program, I suspect Quayle's label privately pleased the Administration 
immensely. President Bush will be rightly seen, regarding defense matters, as 
refreshingly more realistic, honest and intelligent than his predecessor. And 
yet, by having Danny Boy do the job of setting the nation straight, Bush 
retains all his loyalty points, not saying anything unfavorable himself about 
his old boss. No, folks, Reagan wasn't dumb or ignorant about "Star Wars," and 
of course we all know a nice guy like that wouldn't lie, would he? Indeed, the 
man just got a little carried away with "political jargon." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, maybe Bush deserves congratulations for choosing Quayle, in spite 
of how foolish a move it seemed about a year ago. Ironically, Quayle's 
ineptness can be artful, as his latest utterance shows. And with that in mind, 
the man may prove to be an increasingly useful vehicle for Bush to safely say 
certain things that need saying.

INVESTIGATION OF MAYOR BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Mayoring On Into the Boredom Zone" by Phillip E. Present, Op-Ed 
Page, Sept. 7: 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Present opines that our last two mayors' lack of scruples and 
indifference to the needs of their constituency should be shrugged off with the 
excuse, "They got bored." Present also suggests that voters make their future 
choices at the polls by attempting to second-guess an incumbent's enthusiasm 
for his job, as this mayoral ennui can lead to "mismanagement, lapses in 
executive judgment, unethical practices or possibly worse." What is this -- the 
"give Koko a tire swing and he won't tear up his cage" theory of political 
science? 
</P>
<P>
Rather than formulate lame rationalizations, perhaps Prof. Present could 
instead clarify why Bradley finds so little challenge managing the "mundane, 
tedious, low-visibility-yet-essential administrative duties" of the 
second-largest city in the United States. And no matter how stupefyingly dull a 
man might find his job, to simply state that "indifference to the nuts and 
bolts of day-to-day city management can create problems" in no way explains nor 
excuses unresponsiveness to the community and gross conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
If Mayor Tom is bored, maybe it's because so little work of a truly challenging 
nature crosses his desk. Considering the enormity of the job he was elected to 
perform, it would be nice to know exactly who, then, has been handling (or 
mishandling) the important problems for him.

NEW MELONES DAM BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe the expression "out of sight, out of mind" could be used to explain the 
miscalculations and inaccuracies presented in The Times' editorial ("Savoring a 
Dam Decision," Sept. 3) denouncing the value of the New Melones dam. But in all 
fairness to your readers and the numerous beneficiaries of this project, I feel 
those benefits bear repeating. 
</P>
<P>
In your editorial you say that the New Melones dam, located on the Stanislaus 
River, "provides very cheap power for a small number of Californians." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is power generated by the dam goes into the Central Valley Project 
power pool and is then sold to provide power for millions of Californians. New 
Melones generates enough electrical power to meet the annual electrical needs 
of approximately 72,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
The New Melones dam also provides significant water releases to improve water 
quality in the south delta; has saved millions of dollars in avoided flood 
damage costs; offers numerous recreational and fishery opportunities, and 
supplies necessary interim flows in the Stanislaus River for fish and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
All of these benefits, of course, are in addition to 180,000 acre-feet of water 
supply available for municipal and agricultural uses. 
</P>
<P>
It should also be noted that the New Melones project provided significant 
assistance during the last three dry years, and is now being used as a water 
source to replace declining ground water tables in surrounding counties, and in 
some areas to fight sea water intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
Let me remind the editor that in 1974 the voters of California had the 
opportunity to pass an initiative thereby designating a stretch of the river 
where the New Melones dam is located as wild and scenic. That initiative was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, your readers may be interested to know that New Melones dam merely 
replaced a dam originally built in 1926 by two area irrigation districts. 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, the existence of the New Melones dam, as well as many other dam 
projects throughout the state can be easily justified.

INVESTIGATION OF MAYOR BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley is not a crook. And I suppose the report by 
City Atty. James K. Hahn (Part I, Sept. 14) is not a whitewash. Hahn's 
"unprecedented investigation" of the mayor's finances (which Bradley claims he 
insisted upon) lasted six months, ended with a day's conversation with the 
mayor as the final witness in which Bradley told him he had done nothing wrong, 
and concluded that "by George, no crimes had been committed." 
</P>
<P>
If the $18,000 paid by Far East National Bank was not a bribe to get the $2 
million in taxpayer funds, which were deposited under highly irregular 
circumstances after Bradley called the city treasurer about it, then why did 
Bradley give the money back? And why did personnel in the treasurer's office 
falsify documents to conceal Bradley's role? Does anyone really believe Bradley 
did not have control of those public servants! 
</P>
<P>
Far East Bank must think this is a joke. Bank officials got what they paid the 
$18,000 for and then they got their money back! 
</P>
<P>
Talk about sleaze! Comparing Hahn's report with the mayor's claims of 
vindication, one can only conclude that the mayor has forgotten what honor and 
integrity mean. If he had any shred left of the integrity with which he claims 
he has served the public for 47 years, he would leave office voluntarily, 
immediately.

THE GOOD DIE YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony Jerome Gardner was among the best and the brightest in his neighborhood 
of small houses and well-manicured lawns just east of Inglewood. He was an 
Explorer Scout, a volunteer at a sheriff's station in Carson, a good student 
who graduated from University High School with a 3.7 grade-point average and a 
choir member at his father's church. He shunned gangs and drugs, but he could 
not escape the violence. He was killed near his home Monday in a drive-by 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Gang violence killed 3,000 people, mostly young, during the 1980s, according to 
police estimates. Another 15,000 were injured in gang violence. Drive-by 
shootings now happen nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
The level of sophistication and violence among gangs is rising dramatically, 
according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Some street gangs use 
standard business practices -- computers, fax machines and car phones -- as 
they carry out lucrative drug deals. They are quick to punish, and even 
assassinate, informers and competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Was Gardner assassinated for alerting the authorities about gang activity -- 
behavior that marked him as a snitch? Sheriff's deputies say they have no 
evidence indicating that the 19-year-old was a marked man. He "just happened to 
get in the way" of a burst a gunfire while talking with friends near his home, 
according to one detective. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Gardner wanted to make a difference. He wanted to become a deputy, and 
was scheduled to attend the Sheriff Department's training academy starting in 
November. He was not locked into the cycle of crime, violence and easy money 
that can make gang life look so tempting. But neither could he escape it.

'PRIVATIZATION' IS A BLUNT WEAPON AGAINST MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY W. McGEE Jr. and MANUEL PASTOR Jr., Henry W. McGee Jr., professor of 
law at UCLA, lectures on housing and community development. Manuel Pastor Jr. 
is an assistant professor of economics at Occidental College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court majority, which has been unsympathetic to the historic 
aspirations of racial minorities, is not the only "uncivil" legacy of the 
Reagan Administration. Another right-wing obsession, the "privatization" of 
public-service jobs, is also having a pernicious impact on what had been, until 
the Reagan years, a dramatic expansion of the minority middle class. 
</P>
<P>
With a singular determination and fervor, the conservative majority of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors is following the Reagan policy by 
attempting to place virtually every county service, from hospitals to airports, 
in the world of private profit. 
</P>
<P>
With 80,000 workers, the Board of Supervisors is the single largest employer in 
the county. Minorities make up 60% of the county work force. Of the total 
county work force 30%, or 20,000, are black; 18%, or about 13,000, are Latino, 
and nearly 26,000 are minority women. 
</P>
<P>
Black and Latino workers, confronted by private-sector discrimination, have 
traditionally found an avenue of escape from economic circumscription through 
government employment. Equal opportunity and affirmative-action gains in the 
'60s and '70s brought more hiring and advancement opportunities for minorities 
in public employment. Collective-bargaining agreements helped ensure 
wage-and-benefit packages higher than those generally accessible to minority 
workers. Public employment has been, and remains, a principal engine of 
minority economic progress. 
</P>
<P>
This progress is being derailed. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have 
provided new opportunities for employers to discriminate. And "The Widening 
Divide," a recent study by UCLA, has found that the cost of being a minority 
worker has increased over the past two decades. Even after accounting for 
education and experience, black men earn 30% less than white men. The gap 
between Chicano men and white men has grown from less than 10% in 1970 to about 
20% in 1987. Not surprisingly, black family income has stagnated for 20 years; 
Chicano family income is declining. 
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, privatization and the subsequent conversion of 
decent-paying public jobs to low-wage private jobs must be viewed, at best, as 
studied indifference to equal-employment opportunity and also as a contributor 
to the suppression of black and Latino income. To date, the Board of 
Supervisors has contracted out 4,000 jobs, with thousands more scheduled to be 
privatized within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 clerical jobs, largely held by black and Latino women, will soon be 
privatized, too. This summer, nearly 50 such jobs were "sold" to a private 
vendor, who will pay his new workers up to $700 less per month than the county, 
which pays $1,900. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of temporary contract workers, the fastest-growing segment of the 
county work force, are replacing full-time workers. The vast majority are paid 
$4 to $6 per hour and receive no benefits, constituting a new "working poor," 
who must turn to public agencies and private charities for health care, food 
stamps and other necessities. Ironically, money that taxpayers are allegedly 
saved by contracting out services will likely be more than offset by the 
increased cost of publicly financed income subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
If minority and other public-sector workers lose, do minority and small 
businesses at least gain from this county budget pork-barrel? They do not. The 
county has no affirmative action or small business "set-asides," and small 
business entrepreneurs cannot afford to underbid industry giants. 
</P>
<P>
Privatization does not even meet its short-term objectives of efficiency and 
cost effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's review of the state budget, California's chief legislative 
analyst held the privatization plans at least 50% responsible for the loss of 
$22 million in revenue to the state, $3 million to Los Angeles County and $25 
million to poor families who would have received support had services been 
adequately performed. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, it must be added that privatization horror stories concern not 
just Los Angeles County. The local media recently reported on the "hellish" 
road trips of prisoners transported by private guards. In one incident, a woman 
prisoner filed a lawsuit claiming one of the guards had raped her. The same 
company recently got an exclusive contract with the California Department of 
Corrections to transport prisoners to state institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Privatization is bad economics. In the short run, there is evidence that it is 
more costly and less efficient. In the long run, the ultimate, and not so 
hidden, cost is the slow impoverishment of minority workers and their 
communities. Until now, the privatization discussion has been dominated by its 
proponents' questionable claims of cheaper public services. Against the 
landscape of deepening economic troubles for minority and all middle- and 
low-income workers, the real issues must be the quality of those services and 
the role of government in furthering economic and social justice.

HOW MANY GERMANYS? IN WHAT SORT OF EUROPE?; 
</P>
<P>
REUNIFICATION WILL DEPEND ON NEIGHBORS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thinking about what the sudden changes in Eastern Europe might mean to the 
"German question" and the whole of Europe brings to mind the Peter Ustinov play 
"Photo Finish." An old man, returning to life, meets his grandson and during a 
long conversation asks him about the family's coal mines. "Oh, sorry, we have 
been nationalized," he hears. The ancestor, struck by surprise and happiness, 
exclaims, "So we still are a nation!" 
</P>
<P>
We know very little about the possible outcome of glasnost and perestroika, 
either in the Soviet Union or in the other member states of the Warsaw Pact. In 
fact, nowhere in history do we find a precedent for a deliberate and 
fundamental change from communism and a centralized, rotten economy to a 
pluralistic society and a successful market economy. There is a rather short 
path into communist dictatorship: Just apply a sufficient amount of 
revolutionary force. But the other way around, from bankrupt communism to 
fruitful freedom, from Marx to market, this is a path not taken before. We do 
know one thing for certain: Reform in Eastern Europe means the recovery of 
nationhood long subjugated to Soviet influence. 
</P>
<P>
So, some of these changing states might be asking, "Are we still a nation?" 
</P>
<P>
In Poland and Hungary, where reform is taking place at astonishing speed, and 
in Czechoslovakia, where reform lags, if you take communism away, you still 
have nations with deeply rooted traditions that have not been exterminated by 
Moscow's predominance. Take communism away from East Germany, however, and not 
much is left. The German Democratic Republic does not have any raison d'etre 
aside from its ideology. The huge number of citizens leaving the German 
Democratic Republic by way of both Hungary and the more cumbersome, difficult 
legal emigration channels demonstrates clearly the lack of political cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
We can concede that the G.D.R. is the single East European state whose economy 
is in a relatively effective shape, although on a low -- and declining -- level 
compared to the West. The East Germans even enjoyed an unintended glasnost over 
the decades, courtesy of West German TV and radio. Millions of visitors have 
crossed the German-German border in both directions, exchanging their 
experiences. But this modest openness in the end intensified the problem it was 
designed to solve. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the East Germans seemed to be imprisoned forever, many of them were 
resigned to coping with what they had. But nowadays it costs them "only" four 
or five years of waiting and state harassment before they can leave their 
country behind, through legal channels. Instead of reconciling the remaining 
population with the regime, this opening to freedom by departure further 
delegitimizes the state authority. 
</P>
<P>
Now Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, with his call for swift reform, has 
put the East German Communists under even more pressure from their own 
population. They are caught in a double bind: If they reject the concept of 
reform, they alienate themselves still more, not only from their own people but 
from the other East European states as well. If they giveway to political 
pluralism and a market economy, they eventually provoke the question: What's 
the difference between the two German societies that could justify two separate 
states? 
</P>
<P>
So it seems quite natural that West German politicians, mostly conservatives, 
speculate in public about new chances for German reunification stemming from 
the changes in Eastern Europe. I have my doubts about this. We have to learn 
from history that the division of Germany is not the consequence of communism 
but the result of Hitler's war against Europe. And even if the communist 
ideology fades away, the reasons for the division of Germany will not 
disappear. Bismarck's German Reich, founded in 1871, never fit into the 
European framework properly. Even today a united Germany would, economically 
and politically, overwhelm the other European countries. As in Bismarck's days, 
they would have to try to set up a coalition, to which Germany would have to 
react by looking for counter-coalitions. It would be the old game once again. 
</P>
<P>
The real German question is not the existence of two German states, but the 
vast differentials between them in terms of liberty and welfare. If there were 
a real chance to trade unity for freedom for the East Germans, we should have 
to consider the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the question is resolved with one or two Germanys, no final 
solution is feasible without a new European confederation or treaty 
organization, that includes East and West Europe. There must be a framework in 
which it does not matter how strong either a divided or united Germany is, 
because the obligations and liaisons among all the European partners would 
counterbalance any disparity of size and weight. Call it, with or without a bow 
to Gorbachev, a common European house. 
</P>
<P>
We have to complete this house, with the consensus of all prospective 
inhabitants before we can ask how many Germanys we need. Then, however, the 
question would not matter any more. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing now on the convulsions of communism by speculating about German 
unity would be extremely counterproductive -- not only for the reformers in 
Poland and potential reformers in East Germany, but for Bonn's politics towards 
the West as well.

L.A. COUNCIL MEMBERS ASK GOVERNOR TO SIGN SUBWAY BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing broad public support for the proposal, Los Angeles City Council members 
on Wednesday urged the governor to sign into law a bill that requires future 
rail transportation to go underground in the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Subways would "completely protect residences from the adverse impacts that rail 
can bring," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the bill's latest supporter. 
Yaroslavsky added that he wanted to send a message to Gov. George Deukmejian 
that "the coalition of people who support this bill is virtually wall-to-wall." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude, who wrote the bill with state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana), said he was "just thrilled that the developing consensus has 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
The bill is intended to prevent the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission from building a ground-level light-rail system across the East 
Valley. Instead, the bill's backers want the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro 
Rail subway extended west from North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
After passage by the state Senate and Assembly, the legislation went to 
Deukmejian. It must be signed by Oct. 2 to become law. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, the governor vetoed a Robbins bill that would have set up a 
separate fund for a Valley rail project, citing his long-standing objection to 
legislation that intervenes in local disputes. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's City Council meeting, representatives of North Hollywood and 
Sherman Oaks homeowner associations spoke in favor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But some longtime opponents of the bill later said the politicians had 
overstated public sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a number of concerns," said Tom Herman, chairman of the Eastern 
Sector Transit Coalition, which has turned out large crowds to protest 
ground-level rail proposals. "The bill really doesn't go far enough. It doesn't 
give the kind of protection needed for the entire Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Herman and other opponents say that although the bill requires that any rail 
line in the East Valley be underground, it mandates that the line be at least 
25 feet deep only between Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Woodman Avenue. 
Elsewhere, it could run just below the surface -- perhaps covered by a grate -- 
and that could be noisy and ugly, they say. 
</P>
<P>
In Reseda and Woodland Hills, members of the Western Sector Transit Coalition, 
another large group of residents along the Southern Pacific right of way, 
continue to oppose Robbins' bill because they say it would not protect them if 
the rail line is extended through their communities. The Transportation 
Commission has objected to the bill because it gives the state control over a 
local project's design. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the opposition later Wednesday, Braude and Yaroslavsky said 
complete agreement can never be reached on projects of such magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is significantly more consensus than we've ever had before 
on any big public project," Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
Braude also questioned whether many people actually remain opposed. He said 
Rabbi Marvin Sugarman, an original member of Herman's coalition, now backs the 
bill. At the council meeting, Sugarman said the governor's signature on the 
bill would be a fitting new year's present for Valley Jews. The Jewish new 
year, Rosh Hashanah, begins Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission is studying the feasibility of either light rail 
or a Metro Rail extension on two cross-Valley routes: the south shoulder of the 
Ventura Freeway and the Southern Pacific railroad right of way that parallels 
Chandler and Victory boulevards. Both routes would end in Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's $2.1-million study, expected to be completed in November, is 
to serve as a basis for picking a route and also determining what rail 
technology to use. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Metro Rail's steeper per-mile cost, Robbins and Braude acknowledged 
that there will only be enough money to extend Metro Rail west about seven 
miles to Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
From there, travelers would continue to Warner Center on express buses, Robbins 
and Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins told the council that Councilman Ernani Bernardi had become a bill 
supporter. But Bernardi said later that was not exactly accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Alan my position is I'm opposed to fixed rail of any kind, but if 
there's going to be fixed rail, then it should be subway," Bernardi said. "I'm 
not in favor of bringing the streetcars back."

POLICE GROUP REJECTS ANOTHER REDONDO OFFER; 
</P>
<P>
6% RAISE TOO LITTLE BECAUSE OF DANGERS, OFFICERS ARGUE AFTER COLLEAGUE IS SHOT 
IN LINE OF DUTY 
</P>

Citing the shooting of fellow officer Leonard Knott as an example of the 
dangers inherent in police work, the president of the Redondo Beach Police 
Officers Assn. told the City Council on Tuesday that the group had rejected the 
city's latest proposal in ongoing efforts to reach a contract agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Wrightsman said the city has offered police officers the same salary 
increases as maintenance workers and other city employees. Such comparisons are 
off-base, he said, because of the greater risks from police work. 
</P>
<P>
Other city employees "do not face the dangers we face from day to day, from 
hour to hour, or even from call to call," Wrightsman said. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by at least two dozen off-duty officers who joined him in the audience 
in the Council Chambers, Wrightsman said many had just returned from donating 
blood for Knott, who was injured Tuesday in a shoot-out about a block from City 
Hall. Knott was in serious condition Wednesday at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We are praying hourly for his recovery," Wrightsman told the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Shooting This Year 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's shooting was the second this year involving a Redondo Beach officer. 
On Aug. 31, Officer Michael Clifton was grazed during an exchange of gunfire 
after he and another officer approached a suspect apparently trying to break 
into a car on the Esplanade. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach police say that, despite their high level of service, they are 
among the lowest paid in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The average Redondo Beach police officer's salary is about $3,100 a month, 
Wrightsman told the council. On average, according to the association, police 
salaries are 22% higher in Hawthorne, 11% higher in El Segundo and 6% higher in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the city began when the police contract expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 police officers and their families set up tents Monday morning and 
camped out on the front lawn of City Hall in a two-day demonstration protesting 
the stalled contract talks. The camp was dismantled Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Wrightsman said police officers and the city were at odds over issues that 
include pay rates, emergency family sick leave and other benefits. The city has 
been offering police a 6% increase, and the association is seeking a 7% annual 
raise, according to Wrightsman. 
</P>
<P>
The 85-member association unanimously rejected the city's most recent formal 
offer last week, Wrightsman said. Tuesday's informal proposal was not submitted 
to a vote, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Tim Casey has declined to comment on details of the ongoing 
negotiations. He said in an interview that the city has reached agreements with 
the Fire Department and a group of clerical and other employees, whose 
contracts also expired June 30. Those groups signed two-year contracts with pay 
increases of 6% each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the expired police contract, in addition to regular sick leave, officers 
received up to six additional sick days for emergencies, including a death or 
birth in the family or surgery or other serious illness of a family member, 
according to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elimination or Liberalization 
</P>
<P>
The police association says the city is attempting to eliminate that benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said the city's proposal includes broadening the definition of emergency 
sick days and consolidating four different sick-leave plans into one program. 
</P>
<P>
Wrightsman told the council Tuesday that the city's proposal was unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing more to say, and you can have this proposal back," Wrightsman 
told the council, tossing a sheaf of papers onto the speaker's podium and 
leaving the Council Chambers, followed by the officers in the audience. The 
papers were the city's proposal, which had been hand-delivered to the 
association Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Casey said he was "not completely sure that the 
proposal was read seriously by the association. . . . We did attempt to make 
movement toward two considerations that were keeping us apart. (We were) 
attempting to meet them halfway on a couple of issues." 
</P>
<P>
Casey said city and police negotiators met again Wednesday. The city was 
expecting a written response to its Tuesday proposal by the end of the week, he 
said.

PORT UNVEILS ITS PLANS FOR LONG-DELAYED OFFICE TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six years after it first proposed to build an office tower in downtown San 
Pedro, the Port of Los Angeles has unveiled ambitious plans for a heavily 
landscaped, two-block complex that will encompass its current headquarters, a 
new 11-story office building and a separate visitor center. 
</P>
<P>
The complex, which will force the abandonment of a portion of Palos Verdes 
Street, will be the last major project in San Pedro's downtown redevelopment 
district. The 200,000-square-foot office building, which will be occupied 
jointly by port employees and tenants, will be about the same size as the 
Sheraton Hotel under construction a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor officials, however, concede that the complex will not be completed until 
at least the mid- 1990s -- almost a decade later than the original completion 
date. 
</P>
<P>
The plans, which are preliminary, were made public for the first time 
Wednesday, at the biennial meeting held by the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency Board of Commissioners to review progress in the 
20-year-old Beacon Street Redevelopment Area. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the commissioners endorsed another issue of interest to the San 
Pedro business community, agreeing to set aside $1.5 million in CRA money to 
buy land for a parking lot in San Pedro's commercial core. The expenditure, 
which is authorized in the agency's 1990 budget, must be approved by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The parking-lot vote was greeted with enthusiasm by the San Pedro business 
leaders who packed the meeting, and by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who 
proposed the move as a way to ease a parking crunch in downtown San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Flores and the business leaders were less enamored of the port's proposal. 
Although they approved of the concept, they complained -- as they have 
repeatedly in the past -- that the project is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that the port has taken six very long years to reach the 
stage where they are today," Flores told the commissioners. She suggested that 
if port officials do not adhere to a strict timetable for construction, the CRA 
assess financial penalties against the Harbor Department, as it would with a 
private developer. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including the president of the San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, 
echoed Flores' demand. 
</P>
<P>
"Please get tough. Stop this land-banking," said businessman Warren Gunter. "I 
ask the commission: Grow some teeth, grab the Harbor Department by the neck and 
shake some quicker and faster results from your sister." 
</P>
<P>
That remark referred to a comment by CRA Chairman James Wood, who two years ago 
ruled out fining the port, saying it is a "sister city agency and . . . should 
be treated as a member of the city family." 
</P>
<P>
The port's checkered involvement with the CRA began Dec. 23, 1983, when the 
Harbor Department paid $4.3 million for 2.6 acres of property in the Beacon 
Street Redevelopment Area, an urban renewal effort launched by the CRA in 1969. 
The property, on Harbor Boulevard, adjoins a parcel the port already owned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numerous Delays 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the CRA and the port called for the Harbor Department to 
select a developer and submit basic plans for the parcel by Aug. 7, 1984, then 
adhere to a development schedule. In March, 1987 -- after numerous delays and 
extensions granted by the CRA -- the port selected HCT Inc. of Hollywood as the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with HCT dragged on until August, 1988, when the Harbor Department 
ditched the Hollywood firm and declared that it would put up the office 
building on its own. Port officials said then that they believed they could 
complete the office building by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
That won't be possible. The plans unveiled Wednesday, which were drafted by 
Kurt Meyer Partners, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, are far more complex 
than those port officials envisioned last year. They now estimate that it will 
take at least until the mid-1990s to finish the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand and appreciate the frustration," said Harbor Department 
Deputy Director Dwayne Lee at Wednesday's meeting, saying port officials will 
move as quickly as possible to implement their development plans. 
</P>
<P>
But after the meeting, other port officials estimated that it could take as 
long as two years simply to obtain permission from the city to vacate the 
portion of Palos Verdes Street that will be incorporated into the project. And 
port officials said their environmental impact report for the project must now 
be revised to match the new plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wait to Hire Architect 
</P>
<P>
These plans must be approved by the Board of Harbor Commissioners before the 
port can hire an architect to flesh them out in detail. Port officials said 
Wednesday that they are still uncertain whether CRA commissioners must also 
approve the plans, although CRA approval will be required once more specific 
plans are drafted. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the project calls for the development to stretch from Harbor 
Boulevard, between 3rd and 5th streets, across Palos Verdes Street to the 
port's current headquarters, which front that street on the west. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will enter the complex along what is now Palos Verdes Street, which 
will be converted into a driveway and visitors center. The 6,000-square-foot 
visitors center will house conference space and an office for a receptionist. 
Visitors will reach it from either an ornamental staircase or an elevator from 
a parking garage that will run underneath the length of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
The port's current five-story office building and its adjacent garden will form 
the western end of the complex. The existing port building will be reconfigured 
slightly so that its main entrance will be on the second floor, at the same 
level as the visitor center. In addition, the building will be expanded to 
include a day-care center for 75 children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retail Space 
</P>
<P>
The new office tower will occupy the southeastern corner of the complex. Port 
tenants are expected to occupy 140,000 square feet of the tower, and port 
offices will take up the remaining 60,000 square feet. In addition, the tower 
will include 12,000 square feet of retail space along 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The three buildings will be connected with terraces and gardens, and will be 
bounded on the north side by what the consulting firm calls a "linear park with 
pedestrian path." 
</P>
<P>
The path is intended to help blend the complex with the residential 
neighborhood -- the Rancho San Pedro housing project -- to the north, whereas 
the retail space on 5th Street is intended to blend the project with the 
commercial district to the south.

PENINSULA SCHOOLS ANNEXATION OF EASTVIEW BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has approved a resolution supporting the 
annexation by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District of the 
Eastview area of the city, which is now served by the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
About 8,500 residents live in the Eastview area, which was annexed to Rancho 
Palos Verdes in 1983. While youngsters living in Eastview attend Los Angeles 
district schools, the rest of Rancho Palos Verdes is served by the Palos Verdes 
school district. Residents have said they are not dissatisfied with the quality 
of education in the Los Angeles district but want to complete the annexation 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need is your support," Craig Kelford, an Eastview resident and 
co-chairman of Residents for Unified Local Education (RULE), told council 
members Tuesday before they voted for the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles school district has opposed the transfer, saying it would harm 
integration efforts in the San Pedro-Lomita area by removing a significant 
number of Anglo children from the schools. 
</P>
<P>
RULE is putting together a task force of public agencies and Eastview residents 
to work on the annexation proposal.

SYLMAR ADVISORY PANEL BEGINS MEETINGS ON COMMUNITY'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sylmar Community Plan Advisory Committee held its first meeting Wednesday, 
beginning a three-year process of public hearings to determine the future 
character of the East Valley community. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi appointed the 15-member committee in July as the 
first step toward revising the community land-use plan approved by the city in 
1974. The plan establishes guidelines for commercial, industrial and 
residential development in Sylmar, one of the city's fastest-growing 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The committee members spent most of the first meeting listening to city 
planners explain technical aspects of drafting a community plan. But some 
committee members and city officials said the committee will probably spend 
much of its time debating the extent to which Sylmar should preserve its rural 
character. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the last areas the developers have discovered," said David Mays, 
chief deputy to Bernardi. "The community is rightly concerned about how fast 
and how far they want this development to go." 
</P>
<P>
The committee members seemed to be about evenly divided on development issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differing Views 
</P>
<P>
"My intention is to keep Sylmar rural," said Gwen Allen, former president of 
Equestrian Trails. "I don't want to move out to the boonies to keep my horse. 
And I don't want to live in wall-to-wall cement." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, called for planned growth. "I love animals and I love horses 
but I also love cars," said Ed Cholokian, a past president of the Sylmar 
Chamber of Commerce. "Everybody says 'Let's keep Sylmar rural,' but let's also 
keep it a place that can grow and prosper." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi reminded the group that it would eventually have to reach a consensus. 
"I know that there are some fixed positions in the group, but you're going to 
have to compromise. Otherwise you'll be here until 1998." 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar committee is the first of several to be established throughout Los 
Angeles. In 1988, the City Council adopted a resolution that established 
community advisory committees to revise the city's 35 community land-use plans, 
most of which were drafted in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
A community advisory committee will begin meeting in North Hollywood in early 
1990 and another will begin meeting in the Arleta-Pacoima area in the middle of 
1990, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lengthy Process 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar advisory committee is scheduled to hold 17 monthly public meetings. 
After the committee completes its draft plan, it will be reviewed by the 
General Plan Advisory Board, a panel consisting of the director of the 
Recreation and Parks Department, the city engineer, the fire chief and the 
directors of other city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The draft plan will be submitted to the director of planning, who can add his 
own recommendations and amendments. After the director of planning approves the 
draft plan, it will be submitted to the Planning Commission and then to the 
City Council for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeowners, Developers 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar community advisory committee includes landowners, developers and 
representatives of homeowner associations. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi appointed Raymond Magana, a Sylmar attorney, as interim chairman of 
the committee. Other members include Jerome Goodman, president of the Oak Ridge 
Mobile Home Residents Assn., Steve E. Anson, current president of the Sylmar 
Chamber of Commerce, and Linda Chambers, president of the Sylmar Landowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Committee appointees Allen and Karen Duvall are both members of Sylmar 
equestrian groups. Betty Franklin is the only member who took part in an 
advisory committee that helped draft the last Sylmar community plan in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The other members are Margaret Whittington, Morris Wills, Dee Hansen, Charlotte 
Bedard, Clarence Broussard, Robert J. Rassmussen and Barbara Lindsey.

MIRALESTE EFFORTS ARE NOT NONSENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District President Jeffrey Younggren's 
reference as "this nonsense" (Times, Sept. 10) to the efforts of those who 
oppose his voting to close Miraleste and to sell Dapplegray and other school 
properties is a personal affront to me. It must also be an affront to the many 
other Palos Verdes residents who have collected money and spent considerable 
time gathering information, preparing analyses and communicating with public 
officials on these matters. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard for me to see as nonsense the fact that more than $300,000 was 
donated by highly educated residents who oppose Younggren's actions. Maybe 
$300,000 is nonsense (non-cents?) to those voting on $30-million budgets. These 
same residents spent literally thousands of hours of their very valuable time 
on these problems. Were their efforts nonsense? 
</P>
<P>
What is nonsense is Younggren's comment in the same Times article that "As soon 
as we have that (the environmental impact report) we'll (prepare to) close the 
school next fall." How can a responsible, elected official come to a sensible 
decision without first examining the EIR? Have not the courts, the most 
impartial entity in this situation, said the original analysis and decision was 
seriously flawed? Has not the situation changed significantly since the 
original decision was reached (e.g. Proposition 98 money, better demographic 
information, more flight to private schools, movement with respect to Eastview, 
etc.)? What is nonsense is keeping in office people who come out with such 
statements and are unwilling to seriously consider changing circumstances. I 
say we put an end to "this nonsense" by retiring Jeffrey Younggren and those 
who think like him from office!

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RENT-HIKE PLAN ANGERS MOBILE HOME DWELLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 angry mobile home owners crowded into Moorpark City Council 
chambers Wednesday night, protesting that their landlord violated a City 
Council ordinance by proposing to raise their rents 25.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the council approved an ordinance limiting rent increases at mobile 
home parks to the annual increase in the national consumer price index, or 5% a 
year, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm asking is that you stand firm," Cheryl Fay, a mobile home park 
resident, told the council. "We have too many people on a limited income. Even 
if we could stretch this time, we don't feel we could next year." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Villa Del Arroyo Mobile Home Park displayed notices they 
received Saturday that said their rents would jump to $350 a month beginning 
Dec. 1, and that each mobile home owner would begin paying for water usage now 
paid by the park owners. Rents now run from $278 to $346 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, the owners of the park, Villa Del Arroyo Ltd., filed a 
lawsuit against the city, asking $1 million in damages on the grounds that the 
ordinance had hurt them financially. 
</P>
<P>
A decision will be made by the council on the rent increase within 75 days, 
Mayor Eloise Brown said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NOISE LAW WON'T BE REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday not to review the city's 
noise ordinance and to postpone considering a change in the ordinance proposed 
by Southern California Edison Co., whose power plant in the city has generated 
complaints about noise. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Mayor Brad Parton threatened to veto any decision by the 
council to reconsider the ordinance before the city finishes studying it. 
</P>
<P>
The council last reviewed the ordinance in August, when it voted unanimously to 
wait at least six months before giving further consideration to an Edison 
proposal to establish a noise limit of 64 decibels, measured at the power 
plant's borders. The change was proposed by company officials after months of 
negotiation with City Atty. Gordon Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Under the present ordinance, noise levels are measured at a complaining 
resident's home. Legal limits are 50 decibels during the day and 45 at night. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have complained that noise from generators, fans and other Edison 
equipment disturbs their sleep and daytime activities. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Tim Casey said the city attorney and a noise consultant will 
continue studying how noise is measured under the present ordinance. Their 
report will be completed in about three months, he said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TERM LIMIT PETITIONS CIRCULATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of an initiative that would limit elected officials in Inglewood to 
three consecutive terms in office have begun circulating petitions to get the 
measure on the ballot next June. 
</P>
<P>
Curren D. Price Jr., founder of Inglewood Citizens for Reasonable Reform, asked 
the City Council on Tuesday to place the proposed city Charter amendment on the 
ballot without requiring the initiative procedure. But he vowed to gather 
enough signatures if the council takes no action. 
</P>
<P>
Council members did not discuss the proposal at Tuesday's meeting. However, 
Councilman Anthony Scardenzan has spoken out against the measure, and the other 
three council members have argued that the petition process should decide 
whether the measure is placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't care if they limited people's terms to one," Mayor Edward Vincent 
said after the meeting. "I think if the people want it, they should do it."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BATHHOUSE LEASE PUT OFF AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners voted Monday to 
delay once again the granting of a long-term lease for the renovation of the 
Cabrillo Beach bathhouse in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
With just three of five commissioners present, board members were unable to 
agree on a proposal by Commissioner Mary Nichols to reject the two bids for the 
lease and start the bidding process anew. 
</P>
<P>
The board postponed its decision until Oct. 23, when all five commissioners are 
expected to attend. The board first took up the matter in August, but delayed a 
vote then because of questions about both bids. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the board, the recreation and parks staff has recommended 
granting the lease to Hurricane Gulch Development Co., a Pomona partnership 
that would pay the city $2.8 million over 10 years. The second bidders, a 
partnership formed by the San Pedro Bay Co. and the Santa-Monica based Janss 
Corp., would pay $241,000 over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Saying she was concerned about "the real inconsistency in the bids," Nichols 
proposed scrapping them. Commissioner Dominick Rubaclava agreed, but Commission 
President J. Stanley Sanders said he favored the staff's recommendation. Unable 
to reach the required three-vote majority, the commissioners decided to delay 
any action.

CITY PANEL OPPOSES DE ANZA COVE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rules Committee of the San Diego City Council voted unanimously Wednesday 
to oppose a bill proposed by state Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside) that would 
allow the city to grant a 63-year lease to the De Anza Group of Beverly Hills 
to build a $425-million tourist resort around De Anza Cove in Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Craven's bill is necessary for such a facility to be constructed because the 
cove is designated public tideland. But, as Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor, pointed out, council opposition hurts the bill -- because it 
becomes San Diego's position on the matter -- "even though it can still go 
forward in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
The De Anza Group, which operates a mobile home park and campground on the 
property earmarked for development, had expressed interest in building hotels, 
shops, public bicycle and jogging paths, a 13-acre botanical garden and an 
improved golf course as part of its complex. 
</P>
<P>
The De Anza Group now holds leases with the city for the park and campground 
and must have them renegotiated for another 50 years, to the year 2053, for 
construction of the resort to occur. Such an extension would require the 
concurrence of the Legislature, which, in the early 1980s, placed restrictions 
on the length of the leases, resulting in Craven's proposed bill. 
</P>
<P>
Craven was unavailable for comment.

PADRES WIN AS WHITSON GIVES ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres took every precaution Wednesday. Preparations were being made around 
the clock. Not the slightest detail was overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
This was too big a game, Padre Manager Jack McKeon insisted, not to behave like 
a fidgety husband with an expectant wife. 
</P>
<P>
When Ed Whitson went to the bullpen to throw warmup pitches before the game, 
reliever Greg Harris was warned to sit tight. 
</P>
<P>
After every pitch Whitson threw, Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson was right 
there, asking him how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
Every second Whitson spent in the bullpen, McKeon was in the dugout, pacing 
back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
Even Whitson was apprehensive, secretly wondering if the pain in his right 
bicep would return, haunting him just as it did his last start. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what would happen," McKeon said. "We didn't know if he could 
pitch, first of all. And if he could pitch, we didn't know how long. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I was just hoping he could last five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We were prepared for everything." 
</P>
<P>
Except this. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, pitching one of the finest games of his season, surprised the house at 
Riverfront Stadium by lasting eight innings and helping lead the Padres to a 
3-1, 10-inning victory over the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the box score this morning will not have a "W" to the right of Whitson's 
name, but if not for his performance, the Padres might have been talking about 
next year instead of hanging in the playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, who had not thrown a pitch since lasting 2 1/3 innings in his last 
start Thursday, allowed just three hits while striking out seven. He actually 
got better as the game progressed, retiring the final 13 batters he faced 
before leaving after the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"What a game," McKeon said. "That might have been his best-pitched game all 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping he'd just go five. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, he probably could have gone 12 the way he was pitching." 
</P>
<P>
If only he could have thrown in a few for the Dodgers. Playing the San 
Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park, they took a 7-0 lead and were in front, 
7-3, entering the ninth. But the Giants staged another of their remarkable 
comebacks of late and won, 8-7, leaving the Padres five games behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' victory prevented the Padres from reducing their deficit to the 
smallest since June 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, they (the Giants) don't want to come into our place three 
games up in that final weekend," Padre left fielder Chris James said, "because 
they know their . . . will be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn: "They know they have to win every night, 
because we're right there. We're not backing down. We're putting the pressure 
on. If they want that magic number to drop, they have to win themselves, 
because we're not helping." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, putting together the finest winning streak in the franchise's 
21-year history, have won 21 of their past 26 games, 23 of their past 29. The 
streak has put them 14 games over .500 (83-69) for the first time since July 8, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time this late in a season since 1984, the Padres really 
believe they can win this thing, only asking for a chance to have those final 
three games against the Giants in San Diego mean something. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the Padres have just 10 games remaining in the season, doesn't 
McKeon wish he could extend the season by just another week? 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," McKeon said, "we've still got plenty of time. It (the end) is getting 
closer and closer, but we have plenty of time to catch them. I think we're 
going to be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson provided some optimism by allowing just one run on a wild pitch in the 
fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
It was to be Whitson's last mistake of the evening. He did not allow another 
runner to reach base, yielding just three balls out of the infield and striking 
out the side in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's unbelievable, isn't he?" Dobson said. "There's no one that competes 
any better than that guy. What a lift he was for this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Said Whitson: "There was no way I was going to miss this start unless it was an 
absolute emergency. Them boys would have had to tie me up not to let me start 
tonight. We've come too far to take time off now." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who had tied the game in the fifth inning on Garry Templeton's 
sacrifice fly, broke loose in the 10th, albeit in a rather inauspicious way. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn led off with a single to center but was promptly thrown out trying to 
steal second. Cleanup hitter Jack Clark then walked for a record 126th time 
this season, snapping Gene Tenace's franchise record of 125 in 1977. James 
followed with a single to left, and Clark surprised left fielder Herm 
Winningham by taking off for third, barely beating the throw. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great piece of base-running right there," Gwynn said. "We might 
still be playing without that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, because when Benito Santiago hit a ground ball to third baseman Luis 
Quinones, Clark broke for home. Quinones alertly threw to home. But there was 
one problem. The throw was about four feet off target, sailing past catcher 
Jeff Reed to the backstop. 
</P>
<P>
Clark scored, James went to third, and Santiago stood smiling on first. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres added another run when pinch-hitter Carmelo Martinez hit into a 
fielder's choice for his first RBI since Aug. 23. Bullpen stopper Mark Davis 
came into the game in the bottom of the 10th, and three batters later saved his 
41st game. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we're playing now, it's like there's no stopping us," said James, 
hitting .391 over the past five games after two more hits Wednesday. "No matter 
what the situation, no matter what the score, we feel we can't be beat. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep talking about how tough our situation is, but to tell you the 
truth, I kind of like it. I wouldn't trade with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Atlanta, the lineup controversy continues. Despite complaints 
issued Tuesday to the league office by Padre General Manager Tony Siegle and 
San Francisco Giant Manager Roger Craig to the league office, Brave Manager 
Russ Nixon had five non-starters in his lineup and had Rusty Richards making 
his major-league debut on the mound Wednesday. Bill White, National League 
president, telephoned Nixon 30 minutes before Tuesday's game and told Nixon 
that he might consider making a lineup adjustment. Nixon refused. "I don't know 
what it is," Nixon said, "but if I were in their place, I'd be worrying about 
the guys ahead of me instead of the guys behind me. Everybody acts like this is 
the first time something like this has ever happened. They're talking a lot 
about it to the league. If they've got a problem with it, they can call me if 
they want to . . . I don't think if I had a five-game lead and had the best 
club in the league, I'd be worried about what a last-place club is doing. . . . 
I'm going to remember this. You're damn right I am." . . . Reds right fielder 
Paul O'Neill, on Padre rookie pitcher Andy Benes' performance Tuesday in the 
Padres' 5-1 victory: "Twenty-two? Is that all he is? For the first five 
innings, he threw the ball as good as anybody I've seen this year. . . . Don 
Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players Assn., met with the Padres 
and Reds before the game, discussing the upcoming labor negotiations. Fehr 
informed them that the union has retained enough money to pay each player up to 
a maximum $70,000 in case of a lockout or strike. . . . The Padres' local 
telecast of their game last Friday against the San Francisco Giants drew a 20 
rating and 38 share of the Nielsen ratings, more than the combined total of the 
three major networks.

DODGERS FALL IN GIANT-SIZED RALLY, 8-7; 
</P>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO READY TO HOIST THE FLAG AFTER FIVE-RUN NINTH 
</P>

<P>
They danced from the field, through the dugout, around the clubhouse. On this 
most wondrous of nights for the San Francisco Giants, a seven-run deficit 
couldn't stop them, Jay Howell couldn't stop them, and now they believe nothing 
can stop them. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring five runs with none out in the ninth inning Wednesday to beat the 
Dodgers, 8-7, the Giants vowed to dance all night. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sleeping here," Will Clark shouted. "I ain't leaving." 
</P>
<P>
In front of 21,420 stunned and screaming fans at Candlestick Park, the 
first-place Giants showed why if the National League West pennant race isn't 
over, it will be soon. Trailing, 7-0, after three innings, they scored three 
runs off Dodger starter John Wetteland in the sixth and then went through 
Howell, losing pitcher Mike Hartley and John Tudor for five runs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to win it now," Manager Roger Craig said. "This has to take the 
starch out of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The leadoff hit in the ninth was Kevin Mitchell's 46th homer. The turning-point 
hit was Chris Speier's fly ball off Mike Marshall's glove that turned a 
possible double play into a double. The winning hit was Brett Butler's single 
down the right-field line off Tudor. 
</P>
<P>
And the hardest hit were the San Diego Padres. Just as Wednesday's night's game 
began, the Giants' chief pursuers were finishing a 3-1, 10-inning victory in 
Cincinnati. Had the Giants lost, which probably seemed a certainty to most 
Padres as they hit their pillows, the Giants would have led by only four games. 
</P>
<P>
But these are the same Giants who came back from an 8-0 deficit against 
Cincinnati on Sept. 4 to win, 9-8. And what must the Padres be thinking when 
they awake this morning to find themselves five games behind with 10 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be wondering, 'What does it take for us to catch them?' " said 
Earnest Riles, who hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning and singled in the 
ninth. "They've got to be saying to themselves, 'What can you do? What can you 
do?' " 
</P>
<P>
Former Padre Mitchell had a different idea concerning the Padres' reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"They're probably just cussing us out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If they are anything like the Dodgers, they probably were speechless, it being 
difficult to speak with one's jaw dragging on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something to see," said Dodger third baseman Jeff Hamilton, who left 
the game in the fifth inning with a stiff shoulder that he didn't want to 
aggravate in a meaningless rout. 
</P>
<P>
"You're watching it and you're thinking, 'Uh-oh, this is just like we did last 
year,' " Hamilton said. "As the inning goes along, you're saying, 'No way, this 
can't keep happening.' But it keeps happening. And then you realize we can't 
stop it. Nobody can stop it." 
</P>
<P>
It started against reliever Jay Howell, who has 26 saves and had allowed only 
10 earned runs in his previous 76 1/3 innings. In his previous two appearances, 
though, he had allowed four runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
The inning, blow by blow: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mitchell hits a 420-foot homer over the center-field fence, making the 
score 7-4. "I just thought, still no outs, man," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Riles singles to right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Matt Williams, who struck out in his three previous at-bats, doubles to 
right, scoring Riles to make it 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Terry Kennedy doubles to right, making it 7-6. Pinch-runner Mike Benjamin 
replaces him, and Dodger rookie Hartley replaces Howell on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speier, pinch-hitting, lofts a ball to right field that Marshall dives for 
-- and misses. It puts runners on second and third. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the big hit," Mitchell said. "That made us realize we couldn't be 
stopped.' 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Litton, another pinch-hitter, singles to left to score Benjamin with 
the inning's fourth run, moving Speier to third. In comes Tudor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tudor lasts about a minute, as Butler lines his single to score Speier with 
the game-winning run. 
</P>
<P>
It was such a rush, the Giants watched the replays over and over on their 
training-room television sets. 
</P>
<P>
"And we still haven't made an out," Kennedy shouted. "No outs on any of those 
channels." 
</P>
<P>
And for Wetteland, it had all been going so well. Looking for his first win in 
47 days, he scattered three hits over 5 2/3 innings and added a three-run 
double to give the Dodgers their lead. 
</P>
<P>
With the Giants coming out swinging after San Diego's victory, Wetteland 
allowed just four baserunners in the first five innings. He struck out only 
two, but he remained untouched by the sort of big hit or bad pitch that sent 
him into an 0-5 funk in his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
When he was finally relieved by Mike Morgan in the sixth after giving up two 
walks and a run-scoring grounder to Mitchell and two-run homer to Riles, only 
one sign of the old Wetteland lingered: wild pitches. He had two such throws, 
giving him 16 for the season, one short of the Los Angeles team record of 17 
set by Sandy Koufax in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dodger physicians said Wednesday Mickey Hatcher was suffering from a strained 
right groin, not a hernia as first feared. Hatcher will rejoin the team Friday 
and is listed as "day to day" . . . John Tudor said Wednesday that he has 
canceled his retirement plans and will play next season. But he probably won't 
remain with the Dodgers. Tudor admitted that last week that he asked the club 
for his release. The request was denied, but it showed Tudor's frustration in 
having pitched only twice since being activated Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser had a red and swollen right foot Wednesday, the result of a 
Candy Maldonado ground ball that bounced off his shoe in Tuesday's game. He is 
still scheduled to face San Diego rookie Andy Benes Sunday in Los Angeles in 
the third game of this weekend's series. If he can't pitch, Mike Morgan is a 
possible replacement.

GILBERT SOFTENS UP JARRYD; 
</P>
<P>
KRICKSTEIN ALSO PREVAILS IN STRAIGHT SETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Brad Gilbert has won four tournaments this year, but he never seems to do it 
the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert has spent the year killing them softly, never once bruising the air as 
he pitches his normal assortment of slowballs at opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Is this Brad Ball? 
</P>
<P>
Anders Jarryd got a look at it Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very tough to play because he plays very soft," Jarryd said. "You have to 
give all the speed yourself. . . . You have to do all the job yourself." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilbert does darned good work himself and his 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), second-round 
victory over Jarryd in the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament was fairly 
representative of Brad Ball. 
</P>
<P>
Pace is what tennis players call the speed with which balls travel back at 
them. Gilbert is not a pacemaker. He doesn't believe in something that travels 
as fast as pace, for gosh sakes. 
</P>
<P>
"He hits soft and soft and soft and suddenly he's there and hits the ball very 
hard," Jarrydsaid. "He's a very goodplayer." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, whose No. 7 ranking is his best, trailed, 4-2, in the tiebreaker, but 
got back even at 5-5 and then watched Jarryd commit back-to-back errors to 
endit. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Gilbert's pace, it has taken him into the third round against 
defending champion Mikael Pernfors. Anything after that? Gilbert's not saying. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough to play, but if you start worrying about the next round, you'll be 
on the sidelines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Krickstein, who shot free throws with James Worthy and Michael Cooper in 
the afternoon, stayed at the baseline a few hours later and beat Ronald Agenor 
of Haiti, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, a big Detroit Pistons fan, had a chance to try his luck at the 
free-throw line against a couple of Piston archrivals, a meeting arranged by 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Krickstein arranged a third-round date with either Pieter Aldrich or 
Andrew Sznajder. Krickstein said he thinks his chances of winning the 
tournament are as good as anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a real shot, but I have to serve better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some found they had no shot at all. 
</P>
<P>
Quicker than you can say Slobodan Zivojinovic, he lost. 
</P>
<P>
Pernfors beat the 26-year-old Yugoslav, 6-3, 6-0, in 55 minutes and advanced to 
the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Zivojinovic fell when he ran for a drop shot at 3-3 in the first set and play 
was halted briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Once it resumed, Zivojinovic did not win another game. 
</P>
<P>
Pernfors, who joked after his first-round match that he plays with an injured 
brain, had no problems with it against Zivojinovic. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't need to use it that much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing he could do, Zivojinovic said, partly because of Pernfors' 
extreme good luck. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like sometimes you are really feeling hot," he said. "When he closes 
your eyes and still hits the ball, well, what can a person do?" 
</P>
<P>
So what will Derrick Rostagno do after losing, 6-7 (1-7),7-6 (7-2), 6-2, to 
ScottDavis? 
</P>
<P>
"What can you do?" Rostagno said. "Run away?" 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Rostagno is planning to drive away. He is taking his 34-foot mobile 
home on a scenic trip up the coast to next week's tournament at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be a little sad and then cheer up, like everybody else," Rostagno 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica-born Davis, 27, may have earned the quietest $990,254 in 
history, with two wins in seven years and none since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a 1983 All-American at Stanford, is hoping that the week he spent in 
Phoenix working on his serve with Ken Walts will pay off. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been struggling to achieve my potential and it's because of my serve," 
Davis said.

VARIETY ROAD, AT 6 YEARS OLD, STILL MAKING MOST OF TWO CAREERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, Variety Road beat Ferdinand, who won the Kentucky Derby about two 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, at 24-1, Variety Road beat Ferdinand again, as well as Snow Chief and 
Broad Brush, in the San Fernando Handicap at Santa Anita. Ferdinand went on to 
recognition as horse of the year, Broad Brush was voted the second-best 
handicap horse in the country and Snow Chief beat them both in the Strub, three 
weeks after his loss to Variety Road. 
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand, Snow Chief and Broad Brush have been sent to stud, but their nemesis 
continues to make the most of two careers, as a stallion and a runner. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road, now a 6-year-old, serviced a full book of about 40 mares this 
year at Old English Rancho in Ontario, then came back running. Unraced for 7 
1/2 months, Variety Road ran a mile in 1:34 2/5 to set a track record at the 
Sacramento fair in August. Then he won a small stake last Saturday at Bay 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Jerry Hollendorfer isn't getting Variety Road ready for a year-end 
matchup with Easy Goer, but those last two races were notable accomplishments 
for a horse who has chronic sore feet and who once had breathing difficulty 
because of partial paralysis on the left side of his face. And Bruce Headley, 
who trained Variety Road when he ran in Southern California, can remember 
missing the 1986 Kentucky Derby because the horse developed boils on his neck 
and almost died after running a 106-degree fever. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road has now had 11 victories and nine seconds in 34 races, earning 
about $650,000 for his owner and breeder, Kjell Qvale. It is rare for a horse 
to successfully mix racing and breeding careers, but Qvale, a San Franciscan, 
also alternated Silveyville between the breeding shed and the track and he 
earned more than $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Variety Road came back to me the last part of June," Hollendorfer said from 
Bay Meadows, where the horse is stabled. "I couldn't believe that he was ready 
to run a mile as soon as he was. They jogged him at the farm and that had to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Hollendorfer had never trained a horse that went to stud and then returned. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it might be a problem, but it hasn't been with this horse," he said. 
"He's had his mind on the business of running from the time I got him back. He 
looks exactly the same as he did when he left, and as long as his feet aren't 
bothering him, I think he'll be better than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road has shown a liking for grass, and Hollendorfer would like to run 
him in the Tanforan Handicap at Bay Meadows on Oct. 21. Variety Road may find 
the spot familiar. He won the Tanforan last year, which was his last stake win 
until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Months ago, Tom Meeker, the president of Churchill Downs, told his shareholders 
that the Kentucky Derby track would be the site of the Breeders' Cup again, and 
Wednesday the group that sponsors the seven multimillion-dollar races -- some 
of them Churchill shareholders -- confirmed that the Louisville track is 
getting the event on Nov. 2, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Despite bad weather -- the day was raw and wet and the most important race, the 
$3-million Classic, was won by Alysheba in near darkness -- Churchill Downs 
drew 71,000 for the Breeders' Cup last year. That broke the record of 69,000 
set at Santa Anita in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the first four Breeders' Cups were held in California, to the dismay 
of many Eastern horsemen. Since 1987, the races have stayed in the East, with 
this year's Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park near Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on Nov. 
4 and next year's at Belmont Park in New York. Santa Anita is a strong favorite 
for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill Downs will become the first track other than Hollywood Park to have 
the Breeders' Cup twice. The weather in Kentucky will always be iffy at that 
time of year, but otherwise Churchill Downs is a good place for the races. Its 
dirt and grass surfaces are excellent, Louisville can be easily reached by fans 
and horsemen, and the races don't get swallowed up by other sports that more 
metropolitan areas have. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, the people at Churchill Downs are experts at handling big crowds. 
They get plenty of practice, with throngs of more than 100,000 commonplace for 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence must be eager to run. The Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, 
who has been second to Easy Goer in the Belmont and second to Prized in the 
Swaps since then, had been working sensationally at Del Mar, and upon his 
arrival at Louisiana Downs for Sunday's Super Derby, he reared in his stall, 
suffering a minor bump on the head. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence will be favored against seven other 3-year-olds in the 1 
1/4-mile, $1-million race Sunday. Awe Inspiring will be trying to give trainer 
Shug McGaughey his second consecutive Super Derby victory and the other 
starters are expected to be Dispersal, Bruho, Le Voyageur, Harmony Creek, Big 
Earl and Dale's Shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey saddled the winning Seeking the Gold last year. Eddie Maple and 
Laffit Pincay, who have divided victories in six of the first nine runnings, 
don't have mounts. Chris McCarron, who won in 1987 with Alysheba, rides Harmony 
Creek, and Jorge Velasquez, winner in 1982 with Reinvested, will be astride 
Dispersal. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa's owners will have to pay a $120,000 supplementary fee if their 
5-year-old mare is to run against Open Mind, the best filly in the country, in 
the $1-million Breeders' Cup Distaff at Gulfstream on Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
By running against Open Mind on Sunday, in the 1 1/8-mile Ruffian Handicap at 
Belmont Park, Bayakoa's camp should learn whether the Breeders' Cup supplement 
is worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa finished last as the 7-10 favorite in the Chula Vista Handicap at Del 
Mar on Sept. 2. Trainer Ron McAnally thought that the weight -- Bayakoa gave 
seven pounds to the winner, Goodbye Halo -- and a fast early pace contributed 
to his mare's surprisingly poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the weights are concerned, Bayakoa is hardly doing better in the 
Ruffian. She carries high weight of 125 pounds, which is five more than Open 
Mind, who is on a 10-race winning streak. Theoretically, Open Mind was assigned 
126 pounds, but she gets a six-pound break because she's only a 3-year-old. 
Another factor in the Ruffian is Miss Brio, who also carries 120 pounds after 
winning the Maskette Mile in her last start. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Toltackitt, a 2-year-old filly, was the fastest qualifier for Sunday's Pacific 
Coast Breeders Futurity for quarter horses at Fairplex Park in Pomona. A field 
of 10 will run 350 yards for a purse of more than $200,000. . . . The same day, 
Fairplex will take bets on the telecast of the Super Derby. . . . Drouilly won 
the Pomona Handicap in consecutive years, the second time as a 7-year-old in 
1983, and one of his sons, Drouilly's Boy, set the Fairplex track record for 
six furlongs with a time of 1:09 1/5 on Tuesday. . . . Prime Ticket is carrying 
nightly replays of the quarter horse races from Los Alamitos at 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Gary Stevens, who suffered a broken wrist and hand at Del Mar, isn't 
planning on missing his third Breeders' Cup, despite the injuries, and says 
that he'll be back riding at Santa Anita in mid-October. . . . Easy Goer is 
likely to use a $1-million race as a prep for a $3-million stake. He's expected 
to run in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, at 1 1/2 miles at Belmont on Oct. 7, and 
then go back to 1 1/4 miles in the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
King Glorious, who bruised a foot while winning the Haskell at Monmouth Park, 
is expected to run in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. "That's going to be a real 
tough race, but I think he'll be up to it, regardless of whether we get a prep 
race for him or not," trainer Jerry Hollendorfer said. . . . When River 
Memories won the Flower Bowl Handicap at Belmont last Saturday, it was the 
5-year-old mare's first victory since the Rothmans at Woodbine in October of 
1987.

BANNING NO.1 FOR 1ST TIME SINCE 1986 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's just like old times at Banning High this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilot football team vaulted to the No. 1 spot in Cal-Hi Sports' state 
rankings for the first time since 1986, and the administration announced the 
reinstatement of a drug-testing program that lasted for only the '86 season. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Principal Chuck Didinger said Banning athletes involved in fall 
sports and their parents are invited to attend a presentation on the testing 
program tonight at the school's Pat Cragin Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to get 100% backing," Didinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Students who sign up for the voluntary program will be randomly tested for 
drugs and alcohol on a weekly basis at San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, Didinger 
said. Urine samples will be taken from seven to 15 athletes per week. 
</P>
<P>
If an athlete tests positive, the parents are notified and told where they can 
receive professional help for their child. The results are confidential. 
</P>
<P>
"The school is not notified," Didinger said. "It's strictly for parents' 
information. We don't want to place a stigma on any kid." 
</P>
<P>
The program was introduced at Banning three years ago under former football 
Coach Chris Ferragamo, who frequently talked of its success. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ferragamo left for Harbor College in 1987, the testing program was 
discontinued. Part of the problem was going through two coaches in two years: 
John Hazelton arrived in '87 and Joe Dominguez took over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get (drug testing) off the ground when I first got here with 
Hazelton," Didinger said. "But it was too much with a first-year coach." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, Didinger said, he would like to involve more than just athletes in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to involve every student who's involved in an extracurricular 
activity," he said. "Everyone I've talked to is enthusiastic about it." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, with back-to-back wins over South Torrance and Redondo to open the 
football season, is off to its best start since winning the Ocean League 
championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of things," Coach Rich Busia said. "We have a good group of 
kids and there's a little more continuity on the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"When you win a few games, it cures a lot of things. You become a smart coach." 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars' most noticeable improvement is on offense. Led by fullback Tony 
DaCosta, they have scored 56 points in two games. Last season it took Torrance 
six games to score that many points, and the team was shut out six times in 10 
games. 
</P>
<P>
With the toughest part of the schedule remaining, Busia realizes that Torrance 
must improve and stay healthy to have a chance of recording its first winning 
season since '84. The Tartars were 2-8 each of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nowhere to go but up," he said. "We're the underdog." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance visits Ocean League favorite West Torrance on Friday night and opens 
play in the demanding Bay League against Santa Monica next week. 
</P>
<P>
Carson football Coach Gene Vollnogle doesn't like to make excuses, but he was 
upset with the disparity in penalties in his team's 24-23 loss to Bishop Amat 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carson was penalized 10 times for 132 yards, Bishop Amat was cited for 
only three infractions totaling 45 yards. The Colt offense was guilty of nine 
penalties for 120 yards. Bishop Amat's offense was not penalized. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the films (Monday) night." Vollnogle said. "Most of the penalties 
were for low blocks, clipping . . . phantom calls." 
</P>
<P>
Another sore spot was Carson's paltry total of six yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is embarrassing when you can't run the ball," Vollnogle said. "But the 
offensive line is one of the areas where we are inexperienced." 
</P>
<P>
Carson made a personnel change on the offensive line at halftime of last week's 
game and will welcome back starting tackle Darren Dickson for Friday night's 
game against Lynwood at Veterans Stadium. Dickson missed the opener with a 
shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
When Palos Verdes football Coach Bill Judy says his team has a balanced running 
game, he isn't exaggerating. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sea Kings' 14-7 win over South Torrance last Friday, running backs 
George Felactu and Bill Smiley rushed for 91 and 87 yards, while quarterback 
Blake Anderson gained 89. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a plus," Judy said. "But you really have to give credit to the 
offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
He credited the right side of guard Jon Herzog (6-3, 230), tackle Kyle 
Holderman (5-11, 210) and tight end David Bohner (6-5, 220) for opening many 
holes against South. 
</P>
<P>
Judy was also pleased with the progress of several juniors, most notably 
Felactu, Smiley, Bohner, linebacker Tim King (the leading tackler against 
South) and wide receiver-defensive back John Miller. 
</P>
<P>
After two road victories, Palos Verdes plays its home opener at 3 p.m. Friday 
against San Pedro (0-1). As far as Judy knows, it will be the first meeting 
between the schools in football. 
</P>
<P>
Although South is off to an 0-2 start under new Coach Don Morrow, Bishop 
Montgomery isn't taking the Spartans lightly heading into their game at 7:30 
Friday night at Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
"They could very easily be 2-0," said first-year Knights Coach Steve Carroll, 
whose team evened its record at 1-1 last week with a 10-0 shutout over North 
Torrance. "We're going to have to control their passing game. If we do that, I 
think our running defense will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery limited North to 50 yards rushing and sacked quarterback 
Brian Jurado eight times. 
</P>
<P>
"We just swarmed them," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard quarterback Chris Keldorf, a 6-foot-5 sophomore, is off to an 
impressive start in his first season as a varsity starter. 
</P>
<P>
He has completed 35 of 62 passes (56%) for 375 yards and one touchdown in two 
games, helping the Vikings to a 1-1 mark under new Coach Jerry Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Keldorf replaced last year's quarterback, Terrence Sullivan, who was moved to 
tailback and rushed for 132 yards and two touchdowns last Friday in a 21-3 
victory over St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
To understand how highly regarded Keldorf is, consider that Sullivan passed for 
more than 1,600 yards and 17 touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Hand, attempting to instill a team concept in his first year as Serra's 
football coach, is refusing to give individual statistics to the media. 
</P>
<P>
This much we know: The Cavaliers averaged 370.5 yards per game in wins over 
Pasadena, 40-0, and Centennial, 46-7, making them one of the South Bay's most 
productive teams. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Banning's football team is ranked No. 22 in the nation by USA 
Today. Fontana, at No. 15, is the highest-ranked team in California. . . . 
Palos Verdes cornerback Mark Antrobius intercepted two passes against South 
Torrance to give him three in two games. . . . How tough is Hawthorne's 
defense? In two games, the Cougars have given up an average of 80.5 yards. . . 
. Leuzinger retained its No. 2 ranking in the CIF Division II sportswriters' 
football poll, while three area teams moved up. Hawthorne broke into the 
Division II top 10 at No. 7. In the Division VII poll, Serra moved up two spots 
to No. 3 and West Torrance jumped one place to No. 9. Morningside and Mary Star 
both dropped out following losses. . . . Miraleste's water polo team moved up 
two places to No. 7 in the 2-A Division coaches' poll.

BIG LINEMAN CHEWS UP BIG MEALS AND THE OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You are what you kai -- that is, if you're a 6-foot-4, 320-pound lineman named 
Christian Maumalanga. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a lot of groceries to keep a young man the size of Maumalanga -- the 
behemoth of Bishop Montgomery High School -- in fighting form for flinging 
opposing linemen around the football field on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Kai, quite simply, means eat in the language of the South Pacific island of 
Tonga, where Maumalanga's family comes from. It's a word he has been hearing 
from his mother since he was knee-high to, well, an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
Maumalanga has such a healthy appetite, in fact, that he was decidedly 
unimpressed when he read the April 24 issue of Sports Illustrated, which 
detailed the staggering consumption of Green Bay Packers offensive tackle Tony 
Mandarich. The 6-6, 315-pound Mandarich reportedly puts away seven meals and 
between 12,000 and 15,000 calories a day. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nothing extraordinary," Maumalanga said. "I'm a big eater. I might be a 
little bit full, though." 
</P>
<P>
Maumalanga obviously doesn't miss too many meals. He outlined his approach to 
culinary delights thus: 
</P>
<P>
"I get up at 6 a.m., and I get ready to go downstairs and chomp." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, in Bishop Montgomery's 10-0 victory over North Torrance, 
Maumalanga chewed his way through his share of unlucky opponents as well. 
</P>
<P>
He sacked the quarterback two times, turned in seven solo tackles and assisted 
on five others. He also dominated on the other side of the ball. Following 
Maumalanga's ample posterior, Bishop Montgomery tailback Marvin Negrete 
scampered for 135 yards. 
</P>
<P>
And for a young man his size, Maumalanga is not slow. He runs a 5.1-second 
40-yard dash and is strong enough to bench-press 390 pounds. He has made a 
believer of Steve Carroll, Bishop Montgomery's first-year coach, with his 
overpowering play at nose guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Christian just picks up the center and literally takes him back into the 
quarterback," said Carroll. "Right into the backfield." 
</P>
<P>
"It's really tough for some of these poor centers. It's almost impossible for 
even two guys to get any movement out of Christian." 
</P>
<P>
Maumalanga played nose guard for the Knights last year as a junior. This year, 
he's earning his spurs on the other side of the trenches -- at offensive 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"He's excellent at both pass blocking and run blocking," Carroll said. "It's 
very difficult to get past him, and without getting him to go to his knees, no 
one can stop him, either." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Maumalanga's line play wasn't as refined. South Torrance wide 
receiver Johnny Morton (now at USC) was disabled for two weeks last year after 
Maumalanga landed on him in a pileup. 
</P>
<P>
But Carroll predicts that by the end of the year, Maumalanga will be one of the 
premier offensive linemen in the state, even though he is more experienced on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
So do many others. Maumalanga was listed as one of the top 50 recruitable 
athletes in the state by California Football magazine, and in the top 100 in 
the nation by Blue Chip magazine. So far, recruiters from Washington, UC 
Berkeley, Arizona State and Kansas have come calling for Maumalanga's services. 
</P>
<P>
And as if Maumalanga's line play isn't fearsome enough, picture the giant in 
black, with No. 78 stretched across his jersey, looming in Bishop Montgomery's 
backfield at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
It's a frightening reality. Carroll has had Maumalanga run the ball at 
fullback, like the Chicago Bears' William (The Refrigerator) Perry. 
</P>
<P>
The play is aptly named The Tank. 
</P>
<P>
"We have what we think is an extraordinary physical specimen," said Carroll. 
"So we'd like to put Chris in as many situations as he can be advantageous to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Maumalanga has carried the ball only once, for seven yards, in Bishop 
Montgomery's 27-0 opening loss to Leuzinger. But he's thrown a few fullback 
blocks as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I get to crank up and run as quick as I can," Maumalanga said. "And I get to 
knock over whoever is in my way." 
</P>
<P>
Maumalanga has always been the biggest guy around. He's usually the biggest one 
on the basketball courts in Hawthorne, where he lives and shoots hoops on 
weekends with Leuzinger football players Jonas Woodring, Zak Odom and Jim 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth grade, Maumalanga weighed 260 pounds. When he was 14, he tipped 
the scales at 315. He was definitely the guy you wanted on your side for a 
schoolyard game of "Smear the Guy With the Ball." 
</P>
<P>
But being big isn't without its problems, Maumalanga is quick to point out. He 
has a 44-inch waist, but his thighs are so big he buys size-48 Levi's 501 
jeans. And he has to wear Triple-XL shirts with an 18 1/2-inch collar. 
</P>
<P>
"I see all these guys with 32-inch waists, and they're all in fashion," 
Maumalanga said. "I just gotta dress in jeans and a regular shirt. Most of the 
time you won't see me in stylish clothes, and I have to special-order my 
suits." 
</P>
<P>
From Eagleson's Big &amp; Tall and Big Fella Men's Wear. 
</P>
<P>
Maumalanga was born in Redwood City, but his parents were born in Tonga and 
have relatives there. Maumalanga and his family return to Tonga, a group of 170 
atolls between Fiji and New Zealand, once a year. 
</P>
<P>
Maumalanga's late grandfather was a nobleman in the court of the island 
kingdom. He had his own personal island, two miles long and a mile wide, which 
has passed into the possession of Maumalanga's uncle. The island is called 
Ovaka, which in Tongan means boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Clear water and white sand," Maumalanga said. "It's great. It's rural, and you 
just kick back under the palm trees and chomp on mangoes and drink coconuts.' 
</P>
<P>
And fresh fish. Maumalanga fishes the shoreline at Ovaka with a kupega, a round 
net with weights on the side, and hauls in his share of reef fish. He hopes to 
go back to Tonga in December, summer in the Southern Hemisphere, if his 
schoolwork permits. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Maumalanga spends his time in Bishop Montgomery's recently 
refurbished weight room. Over the summer, he set marks of 870 pounds in the leg 
press, 390 in the bench press and 300 in the power clean at the weightlifting 
competition at the Pepsi Grid-Hoops Festival at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at me and say, 'Six-four, 320, that guy's a big, fat sucker,' " 
Maumalanga said. "I'm not as fat as people think." 
</P>
<P>
He also is a decent hand on the basketball court. And he excelled at baseball 
as a youth, when he was too heavy to play Pop Warner football. He's considering 
playing those sports at Bishop Montgomery this year, time permitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to go out there and set a couple of picks," Maumalanga said. 
</P>
<P>
Nail down your backboards and hide your catchers.

229 yards and three touchdowns, including an 89-yard run, to help Torrance 
(2-0) match its win total of 1988 with a 41-30 victory over Redondo. He also 
kicked a 34-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>

have been outscored 56-0 in two games this season. 
</P>
<P>
* El Segundo, which was 10-1 and the Santa Fe League champion last season, has 
been outscored 46-7 in two games and has lost three straight dating back to 
last year's 30-7 playoff defeat to Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
* The Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team completed nonconference play 
with an 0-8 record, failing to win a game in each match. Four losses were to

HOOKED ON TABLE TENNIS; 
</P>
<P>
LEON RUDERMAN EVEN DESIGNED HOME AROUND THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to tell that Leon Ruderman had table tennis in mind when he and a 
longtime architect friend designed his Manhattan Beach home about a year and a 
half ago. 
</P>
<P>
The fancy, two-story house has an Art Deco flair that makes it stick out among 
its neighbors on the Strand. It could easily earn a spot on "Miami Vice," if 
the show were still taping. 
</P>
<P>
"The contractors laughed," said Ruderman, "when they saw that the whole place 
was designed around the table tennis room." 
</P>
<P>
That's Ruderman's hangout, his obsession. A Ping-Pong table and practice-ball 
machine occupy the room, which is in the center of the house. There's also a 
rack with about 60 trophies that Ruderman has won throughout his 20-year table 
tennis career. 
</P>
<P>
The energetic 61-year-old is the state's top-ranked player in his age group and 
12th in the world. Last year he won the doubles title at the U.S. National 
Championships in Las Vegas with partner Y. C. Lee of Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Ruderman also reached the round of 16 at the Veterans World Championships in 
Yugoslavia, a tournament that included 1,600 of the world's top senior 
competitors from 70 different countries. He lost to the eventual champion, a 
German. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 he placed third in doubles at the World Masters Championships in 
Toronto, and in 1985 and 1986 he placed second in the 50-and-over division at 
the U.S. Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very special for his age," said Ruderman's 28-year-old coach, Wei Wang, a 
former professional player in China who is ranked third in the United States. 
"He likes to learn new things and play very aggressively. Usually people his 
age play slow and defensively, and they don't want to learn new things." 
</P>
<P>
Not Ruderman. He's a physically fit and ambitious businessman who plans to 
compete as long as his feet will hold him. He also hopes to promote table 
tennis, which became an Olympic event in 1988 and is extremely popular in 
countries such as China, Yugoslavia and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually wants to make Manhattan Beach a hotbed of table tennis. Last 
spring he introduced a program to the city Recreation Department that will 
feature open play, tournaments and instructional classes. The plan was 
immediately approved by the city and will begin next month at the Manhattan 
Heights Community Center auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"We put it before the Parks and Recreation Committee, and they really liked 
it," said Ed Montan, assistant recreation director for Manhattan Beach. "Leon 
has been very helpful. He's donated a lot of time to the program. He even 
volunteered to train instructors." 
</P>
<P>
Besides organizing the Manhattan Beach program, Ruderman helped secure funding 
for it and got an instructor, Wei, who teaches similar programs in Orange 
County and West Covina. Ruderman also plans to have a series of local 
tournaments. The first one will take place at Mira Costa High School from 
Friday to Sunday and will feature beginners as well as advanced players. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurred to me," Ruderman said, "that Manhattan Beach has always been 
athletically oriented. That's why I want to use Manhattan Beach as a focal 
point to generate additional interest in the game. We have the equipment and 
the opportunity here." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, the founder and director of the Chinatown table tennis club in Los 
Angeles, says Ruderman has always been an advocate for the game. They have 
known each other for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what he's doing is terrific," Lee said. "When I first came (to the 
South Bay) in 1972, there was a small club in Palos Verdes, but it didn't last 
long. We need to get it started in the area, and he has the dedication and the 
energy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Ruderman and his son, Gary, also own a production company that specializes in 
table tennis videos. The tapes, which include highlights of exciting world 
championship matches, have been distributed in 12 countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The Magic Johnson of Yugoslavia plays table tennis," Ruderman said. "To give 
you an example of how popular it is in other countries, the U.S. Table Tennis 
Assn. has about 6,000 members. In West Germany there are about 700,000 members, 
in Japan there's 300,000 and in France 200,000." 
</P>
<P>
Ruderman knows it won't be easy to match those figures in a country where 
football, baseball and basketball take priority among most sports fans. But he 
plans to make the effort to get others involved in what has been his fixation 
for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
He initially became involved with table tennis in 1946, as a high school senior 
in New York. He was a top-ranked chess player and had been invited to compete 
in a tournament along with nine of the state's best high school players. 
</P>
<P>
Discouraged after losing most of his chess matches in the prestigious event, 
Ruderman took a walk down Broadway and was attracted by the sound of Ping-Pong 
balls coming from a table tennis club. 
</P>
<P>
He played the game throughout his senior year in high school but was inactive 
through college. It wasn't until 1973 that he brought his paddles out of 
retirement after watching a tournament in Redondo Beach with his two sons.

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
TEAMS MUST TRY TWICE AS HARD TO PICK UP WIN IN SCIAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regardless of how their teams perform in a game that brings victory, most 
football coaches will concede that "a win is a win is a win." 
</P>
<P>
However, that is not necessarily the case in the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, in which victories are sometimes worth 
only a half-win. 
</P>
<P>
In the SCIAC, each team plays one conference member twice in a season, making 
for unusual standings. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, for example, Redlands defeated La Verne, 19-3. The win earned 
Redlands sole possession of first place in the SCIAC with a record of 0.5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands will not receive credit for a full victory unless it defeats La Verne 
again later this season. Should La Verne win the rematch, the two games will be 
recorded as a tie, something the conference apparently has little use for. 
</P>
<P>
If the score is tied at the end of regulation, SCIAC teams play a tiebreaker, 
alternating possessions from the opposition's 25-yard line until one team 
scores unanswered points. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental will play Whittier twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
Goal oriented: Craig Pannell, Azusa Pacific's tight end, scored on a 36-yard 
pass play Saturday against Occidental. Not bad for a guy who spent his entire 
high school athletic career trying to prevent people from scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Pannell did not play football at Kennedy High. Instead he earned All-City 
Section honors tending goal for the Golden Cougar soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Pannell was 6-foot-3, 180 pounds when he graduated from Kennedy in 1984 and 
decided to try out for football at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
"After playing soccer my whole life and playing goalie, I knew catching the 
ball would be no problem," said Pannell, who took two years off between seasons 
at Moorpark. "A football coach at Moorpark got me lifting weights and I liked 
it. I started getting bigger and bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Pannell now stands 6-6 and weighs 245 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Portland power: Curtis Delgardo, Portland State's All-American running back, 
had a plate inserted Monday into the broken right ankle he sustained Saturday 
at Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Delgardo's absence will slow Portland State, but the Vikings are still held in 
high regard by Bob Burt, football coach at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"They still have as much or more talent than anyone in the conference," Burt 
said. "It depends on how they handle it mentally. They threw for almost 500 
yards against Montana, so they're obviously doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Portland has played in the Division II championship game in each of the past 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Getting offensive: Portland State's Darren Del'Andrae, a junior from Calabasas 
High, leads the Western Football Conference in passing with 827 yards in 10 
quarters of action. With the loss of Delgardo, Del'Andrae likely will enhance 
his per-game average. 
</P>
<P>
Another player Portland fans may be seeing more of is Glenn Vereen, a junior 
transfer from Antelope Valley College. Vereen, who gained 1,007 yards for AVC 
last season, may replace Delgardo at tailback. Vereen hasn't seen much action 
in Portland's first three games because of two reasons -- the presence of 
Delgardo and the task of learning a new offense. 
</P>
<P>
Questionable choice: Leo Biggs, a linebacker from Southern Utah State, was 
selected defensive player of the week in the WFC after making 14 tackles, 
including two sacks, against Idaho State. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics are certainly impressive, but they make Biggs' selection no less 
curious. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Utah not only lost the game, 37-34, but also allowed 355 yards in 
offense. In the same press release that Biggs' selection was announced, Jack 
Bishop, Southern Utah's head coach, is quoted as saying, "Someday, we have to 
start playing better defense, but I don't know if I'll live long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bombs away: In its two losses, Occidental has surrendered four touchdowns -- 
all of them on passes of 26 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental has been handicapped by injuries to key players such as cornerback 
Ben White and safety Craig Hartley, but Tiger Coach Dale Widolff said that the 
problem has been lapses, not personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing pretty good pass defense," said Widolff, whose team has three 
interceptions. "We're getting good pressure. It's just the inconsistency, We've 
broken down at critical times." 
</P>
<P>
Dearly departed: Muhammad Zaid, a redshirt freshman from Van Nuys High, has 
left the Valley College football team. Zaid had transferred to Valley from 
Grambling State. 
</P>
<P>
Gaps to fill: There are only eight sophomores on the Antelope Valley College 
football team this season, leaving Coach Brent Carder understandably concerned 
about the Marauders' inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
But Carder's worry has subsided recently because of the defensive play of 
Theron Egana and Dennis Bowker. 
</P>
<P>
Egana and Bowker, both freshmen, rank first and third in tackles after two 
games. Egana, a 5-11, 205-pound linebacker, was involved in 18 tackles, 
including 11 that were unassisted, in last week's 34-7 victory at Porterville. 
Bowker, a 5-9, 220-pound lineman, was in on 14 tackles and was selected the 
Marauders' defensive player of the game for the second week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Egana's 18 tackles rank him seventh in school history in the single-game 
category. He had 17 in the Marauder's opener against El Camino. 
</P>

HENNING LIKES LOOK OF NEW PUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As recently as Monday, Charger punter Lewis Colbert received a vote of 
confidence from Coach Dan Henning. Twenty-four hours later, Colbert was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian import Hank Ilesic became the second candidate to fill the shoes of 
perennially successful Ralf Mojsiejenko, and Henning gave him a rave review 
after seeing him punt for the first time in practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Ilesic really looks the part," Henning said. "He has as quick a get-off time 
as I've ever seen. His average for 16 kicks today was 1.8 or 1.9 seconds. He 
even has room to slow down. He stands in a crouch and moves into the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Henning added that Ilesic might kick off as well as punt when the Chargers meet 
the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a 62-yard average kicking off in the Canadian League," Henning said. 
"Figuring in onside kicks and popup kicks, he's probably a goal-line kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't practice kickoffs until tomorrow, and we'll decide then about Sunday. 
He's a straight-on kicker and we have to get him a square-toed shoe. It's 
possible he'll even kick long field goals. He kicked 30 one year in Canada. We 
want to utilize him to the fullest." 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic, 30, who is of Austrian-Yugoslavian descent, averaged 45.4 yards per 
punt in the CFL. He is the only player in the NFL without college experience, 
having joined the Edmonton Eskimos in 1977 after his junior year in high 
school. He spent six seasons with the Eskimos and was in his seventh season 
with the Toronto Argonauts when he obtained his release last week, clearing the 
way for him to switch to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wanted to be in the NFL for many years," Ilesic said. "The problem is, 
the CFL likes to keep its own people, especially kickers and high-profile 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic noted that players can't play out their options in the CFL as in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always under contract," Ilesic said. "I had a contract dispute with 
Edmonton in '82, and Dallas wanted to sign me. We had a deal worked out to get 
me out of the league but it fell through and I wound up in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very persistent, and I persevered. The Argonauts finally came up with an 
agreement to release me." 
</P>
<P>
Colbert averaged only 33.3 yards, last in the AFC, in his two games as the 
Charger punter. Mojsiejenko, traded to the Redskins at cutdown time for a 
seventh-round draft choice, is tied for second place in the NFC with a 44.8 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Charger kicker Chris Bahr said Colbert was treated unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to see him get a better shot," Bahr said. "It seems to me 
that an awful lot was written about the punting, and there are a lot of places 
where we need to improve." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Running back Marion Butts (knee) and defensive end Burt Grossman (foot) were 
listed as questionable on the Chargers' injury report. Both worked out, but 
Coach Dan Henning said he was less optimistic about Grossman than Butts for 
Sunday's game against Kansas City. Grossman said he would be ready. . . . 
Quarterback Jim McMahon (groin) was listed as probable and took most of the 
snaps Wednesday. Also probable are linebacker Jim Collins (toe and knee), guard 
Dave Richards (concussion), safety Vencie Glenn (concussion), cornerback Sam 
Seale (concussion), cornerback Gill Byrd (ankle) and linebacker Gary Plummer 
(neck). The Chiefs' injury report: linebacker Angelo Snipes (knee), out; 
running back Kenny Gamble (foot and shoulder), linebacker Derrick Thomas 
(groin), linebacker Dino Hackett (ankle), defensive end Leonard Griffin (knee) 
and running back James Saxon (shoulder), questionable; tackle Irv Eatman 
(shoulder), guard Dave Lutz (hamstring), center Mike Webster (ribs), center 
Michael Morris (groin), wide receiver Carlos Carson (groin), wide receiver Robb 
Thomas (neck), tight end Jonathon Hayes (shoulder), defensive end Mike Bell 
(calf) and cornerback Alfred Lewis (ankle), probable. . . . Chiefs Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer, who was considered last winter for the San Diego coaching 
vacancy, said in a conference call Wednesday, "We had some dialogue on a couple 
of occasions, but the job was never offered to me by the Chargers. It became 
clear that they obviously had made another decision."

DAVE DISTEL: SDSU FOOTBALL JUST CAN'T SEEM TO FIND A CONFERENCE THAT FITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to football, San Diego State is the guy wearing the Hawaiian 
shirt to a black-tie dinner, a three-piece suit to a luau, or cowboy boots and 
a string tie to a disco. 
</P>
<P>
It cannot seem to come to terms with what is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
If college conferences were social events, SDSU would be standing in front of 
its closet wondering what to wear. The problem is that it cannot seem to find 
any place it's comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, a member of the Western Athletic Conference, known 
acronymically as the WAC. This is a far-flung confederation of universities 
with whom SDSU has little in common culturally, geographically, 
meteorologically and even, in at least one case, religiously. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, SDSU would seem to fit in the WAC about as well as Florida State would 
fit in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, SDSU would be a better fit with either the Pacific 10 or the 
Big West. Competitively, it might be a better fit in the Pacific 10, 
considering it lost its WAC opener to Air Force, 52-36, and then lost to UCLA 
last Saturday by only 28-25. It plays Cal State Fullerton of the Big West 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
These options -- WAC, Pac-10 or Big West, as well as playing as an independent 
-- were presented to San Diego County residents in a recent Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
I was quite curious how the public would respond to a question dealing with the 
SDSU athletic program, because I knew the sophistication of the polling methods 
would provide an accurate reflection of what the fans would like to see. 
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to assessing the results, I should confess to being prejudiced. As 
you might have already concluded, I am not of the opinion that the WAC is the 
place for the Aztecs. I base this opinion in part on a feeling that San Diegans 
are not excited by a conference with which few can relate. 
</P>
<P>
So what turns up in The Times' poll? 
</P>
<P>
A total of 860 San Diego County adults were polled, 64% of whom had a response 
to the question of where SDSU athletics belong. My first thought was that SDSU 
should be concerned that 36% don't care enough to have an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 My next reaction was surprise that 51.6% of the 554 respondents felt the WAC 
was the right place to be. I didn't realize that many people had moved here 
from Laramie, Ft. Collins, Provo and El Paso, though I could hardly blame them. 
</P>
<P>
I expected a larger push for moving to the Pac-10, which finished third at 
18.8%. Going independent, the move I favor, was second at 21.9%. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear that San Diegans did not want to see the Aztecs take a backward 
step to the Big West, which they left 11 years ago when it was called the 
Pacific Coast Athletic Association. Only 6.3% favored a return to the 
conference that includes the Lesser Cal States, UNLV, New Mexico State and Utah 
State. 
</P>
<P>
At 1.4% were respondents who chose "other." This group, I guess, would like to 
(a) see if the Aztecs can do as well as the Chargers in the National Football 
League or (b) quit trying to play football with the big boys altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The mandate here seems to be that the WAC is fine with the populace. 
Consequently, it would seem that the fact that SDSU is so poorly supported has 
to be a reflection of the program itself. 
</P>
<P>
To examine this phenomenon, let us look at the 22 years the Aztecs have played 
their home games in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Conveniently, there have 
been 11 pre-WAC years and 11 WAC years. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of average attendance, five of the top six years were pre-WAC. The top 
year, 1975, was a year in which home opponents included UTEP, North Texas 
State, Cal State Fullerton, New Mexico State, Arizona and Cal State Long Beach. 
The No. 2 year, 1969, featured Cal State Los Angeles, UC Santa Barbara, 
Pacific, New Mexico State, North Texas State and Cal State Long Beach. Those 
are ugly schedules, but the Aztecs were 8-3 and 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11 years since the step up in class to the WAC, the Aztecs have had 
their seven worst seasons attendance-wise. The schedules have been much more 
attractive but Aztecs have been so ugly. 
</P>
<P>
And so I guess it comes down to that most unforgiving of bottom lines. It is 
not a matter of who you play as much as how you play. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the poll asked the wrong question. Maybe it should have asked if San 
Diego County would support a successful intercollegiate football program. 
</P>
<P>
Should that be the case, as I suspect it would be, SDSU should be looking down 
the road at a place where it might enjoy some success. Sorry folks, but the WAC 
does not look like the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
My conclusion, thus, is that San Diego State would enjoy its greatest success 
as either an independent or a member of the Pacific 10. Either would enable it 
to offer potential recruits increased exposure on network television and the 
chance to play in a New Year's Day bowl game, neither of which are now 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to hunting talent, bigger games will produce bigger game.

La Jolla-based Cytel Corp. has signed a five-year joint research agreement with 
Sandoz AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical firm, the companies said Wednesday. The 
agreement could generate as much as $30 million to develop drugs against 
rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
In return for the agreement, privately held Cytel agreed to sell less than 20% 
of its outstanding stock to the Swiss firm. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoz and Cytel hope to develop a new class of immunological drugs, called 
"auto-immune blockers," to treat rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent 
diabetes and other diseases. Auto-immune disease results from the body's 
failure to distinguish "self" from "non-self" molecules. The immune system 
attacks body tissues as if they were foreign molecules. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies also hope to develop drugs to prevent tissue rejection in 
organ transplant patients. 
</P>
<P>
Cytel was formed in 1987 to apply recent advances in immunology to the 
development of drugs.

TAYLOR GUITARS MAKES A CASE FOR BETTER FIT AND STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taylor Guitars, the well-known, Santee-based guitar maker, now produces 
better-fitting, stronger and more stylish cases for acoustic guitars. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, which has been producing acoustic guitars since 1974, began 
manufacturing the cases after concluding that there was a shortage of quality 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Starting this week, all instruments crafted by Taylor will be packed and sold 
in the all-poplar cases. In November, the company will begin offering them for 
$200 through retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical case is made to fit any number of guitars because they all vary in 
design and shape," said Kurt Listug, Taylor's vice president. "As a result, we 
could never find a case with a snug fit. That's why we decided to make our 
own." 
</P>
<P>
The cases, which feature a chestnut-brown vinyl covering, velvet interiors and 
an embossed, gold-leaf Taylor logo -- are designed specifically for Taylor 
guitars, Listug said, but they will accommodate other brands as well. 
</P>
<P>
The new cases provide better protection because the tops and bottoms are 
arched, he said. Because of that design, "it's harder to shove the case into 
the guitar and crack the guitar." 
</P>
<P>
Musicians who travel may like the new cases because they are also smaller and 
easier to carry. "We don't make them any bigger than they have to be," Listug 
said. "It doesn't have all the extra foam and padding." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Taylor plans to manufacture 200 cases a month -- just enough to 
match its monthly guitar production. After a year, Listug said, the company 
expects to double that. With more than 700,000 imported and domestic acoustic 
guitars purchased in the United States last year, demand is plentiful for 
handsome, durable cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll be surprised how quickly people go through cases," said Listug, 36, 
who, at age 21, teamed with Bob Taylor to form Taylor Guitars. Taylor, 34, is 
president of the company. He made his own guitars in wood shop classes during 
his teens and today designs the company's instruments. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Listug and Taylor were working at American Dream, a guitar repair and 
custom shop in Lemon Grove. They purchased the store and launched Taylor 
Guitars. GENE YASUDA

Elizabeth Townsend has been named vice president/general manager of Townsend 
Leasing. She will be responsible for overseeing all leasing operations in the 
downtown leasing office. 
</P>
<P>
When Townsend joined her father and brother in the family-operated automotive 
dealership a year ago, she became a member of the third generation of Townsends 
to sell and lease cars in San Diego. Her grandfather started the business in 
1927 selling Studebakers. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather had a dealership on the corner of State and B downtown," 
Townsend said. "I remember the little jingle he had on the radio, and I still 
run into customers of his who are now in their 70s and 80s." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend, 32, is a graduate of Stanford University with a degree in history. 
After living in Florence, Italy, for seven months studying art, she moved back 
to San Diego and earned her master's degree in business administration from the 
University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Despite family tradition, Townsend did not immediately jump into the automotive 
business. Her first job out of college was assisting the vice president of the 
Metro YMCA of San Diego County. Before her arrival at Townsend, she spent two 
years as an account representative for the Adcentive Group, a San Diego-based 
specialty advertising company. 
</P>
<P>
"My father and brother came to me and said, 'You're selling ads, why not cars?' 
" Townsend said. "My father had thought of starting a leasing company, and he 
wanted to teach me the business." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend said she wanted to get involved in what she sees as the "renaissance 
of downtown." "Thirty years ago, there used to be all dealerships here in 
downtown," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our leasing company is geared toward the professional or downtown person. 
Leasing is for everybody, but professionals in particular seem to like how it 
fits into their life style of a new car every two years." CAROLYN LEMKE

 U.S. District Court Judge Earl B. Gilliam on Wednesday denied a request for a 
temporary restraining order that would have prohibited San Diego-based Smith 
Laboratories from implementing a shareholder protection plan. The order was 
sought by Joel Rocha Garza, a Mexico City resident who, along with Clarendon 
Group, an affiliated firm, owns 8.46% of Smith's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Garza has indicated that he is interested in acquiring more of Smith's stock. 
"We are pleased with Judge Gilliam's ruling but recognize that Mr. Garza will 
have additional avenues to pursue in the future," said Smith President Timothy 
J. Wollaeger.

JACK SMITH: TRUSTY JEEP JOGS MORE MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As I expected, my eulogy for the jeep, which is being honorably discharged from 
service in the U.S. Army, stirred many fond memories of that sturdy vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
A GI who had access to a jeep was, as I suggested, a very lucky GI. A jeep 
meant access to nearby towns, and, the ultimate, to nearby girls. 
</P>
<P>
Wilfred H. Shaw of Hermosa Beach recalls his "love affair" with a jeep that he 
had acquired late in the Pacific war through a series of improbable 
circumstances and sheer good luck. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was a Navy jeep, delivered by an errant God to his very door; with 
the help of friends, he soon repainted it in Air Corps colors and gave it a 
fake serial number. 
</P>
<P>
It was not an improper use of government resources, he insists, since his job 
frequently took him to nearby air bases and to the harbor in search of lost 
shipments. "Truthfully, however, it also sure helped in getting to the beach, 
and was a real hit with the nurses and the occasional USO performer." 
</P>
<P>
Transferred to the Philippines when the war ended, Shaw left his beloved jeep 
in the care of another civilian friend. Returning weeks later, he found that 
the friend had also been transferred, "and had managed to squeeze that prize 
aboard the C-46 that carried him away." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw says he later received the Bronze Star for his work on an aircraft repair 
station on Iwo Jima during the invasion, "but I'd rather think it was in 
appreciation of my months of loving care for that purloined Navy jeep." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Seelye of Fallbrook is moved by my story of using a jeep on Maui when I 
was with the 4th Marine Division, to recall a visit he and his wife made some 
years ago to Makawao, a little cowboy town near our divisional campsite. The 
natives were having their annual festive roundup, and a remnant of the 4th 
Division had come to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a parade . . . and amidst the usual school bands, horsemen and 
women, funny bike riders and others, here came the 4th Division. Some had 
veterans organization caps on, some baseball caps; they were paunchy, bald, 
several leaned on canes as they limped through the hot, dusty town. Their order 
of march was the most unmilitary display I had ever seen; no cadence, no smart, 
stiff-backed quick-stepping Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"But one wondered who they were. Were they carpenters, plumbers, doctors, 
cabdrivers, schoolteachers? Probably they were all of these and none of these, 
because they were average American men who had served their country, survived 
in time of terrible war and returned. . . There was scarcely a dry eye on that 
street. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Was it that long ago? 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1940s James R. Pratley of Rancho Bernardo drove a jeep as a forest 
ranger in Angeles National Forest. "We used anything that would run with any 
degree of reliability and on that score, they were unbeatable. . . . 
Comfortable they were not, and if the weather was bad, rain or snow, you knew 
you were in for a very miserable day. (But) six men, stakes, transit and level, 
together with whatever else was needed on the job would all fit in one jeep. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas D. Cullen of San Pedro says I must have been joking when I said American 
generals rode in jeeps but German generals rode in Mercedes phaetons. He says 
German generals would more likely have visited the front in a Kubelwagon (about 
the same size as a jeep but with doors) or a Horch, a larger, boxy six-seater 
that was "equivalent to what we used to call a command car." He compares the 
Kubelwagon with the Volkswagen convertible. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen and I must not have seen the same World War II movies. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Kysar of Reseda and A. G. Jungers both insist that the jeep was first and 
properly called a Peep. If so, that name was history when I joined the armed 
forces. Webster's New World Dictionary says jeep is an abbreviation for G.P. -- 
General Purpose Car. Peep is "a brief, hasty look. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Jeep is a trademark for the popular civilian Jeep, which is 
slightly larger and more comfortable than the military jeep, and is still 
manufactured by Jeep Eagle, a division of Chrysler Motors Corp.

 DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: MORTGAGE NEARS END AT BENEFIT

The Bayside Settlement House, the only institution of its kind in the state to 
retain the old-fashioned designation for a neighborhood social-services center, 
benefited Friday from a kind of anticipatory mortgage-burning party at the San 
Diego Omni hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement house, which actually operates a pair of facilities (in Linda 
Vista and City Heights), was founded in 1932 by the Sisters of Social Service 
and has been aided since 1940 by the Social Service auxiliary. The auxiliary 
hosted the "Sterling" fashion show and luncheon, one of several fund-raisers 
this year to help raise $100,000, which would retire the Bayside Settlement 
House's mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Big dreams sometimes call for big guns, and the Social Service auxiliary called 
upon three of the county's biggest when it picked socialite and key fund-raiser 
Virginia Monday and philanthropists Bob and Sherrill Baker for its annual 
Outstanding Citizen of San Diego awards. The trio proved a more than sufficient 
draw -- some 400 guests attended. (They stayed on to gasp and gape at the 
occasionally outrageous fashions presented by La Jolla's Capriccio.) 
</P>
<P>
Auxiliary President Kay Upton called the mortgage retirement a long-held 
desire. "Bayside Settlement House serves the frail elderly, the homeless and 
children in a unique way, and has been doing so for 57 years," she said. "Our 
auxiliary members have been working quietly to help for nearly all that time. 
We're a very humble group." 
</P>
<P>
During the awards ceremony, Bob Baker, who owns a number of automobile 
dealerships, surprised and captivated the audience by the unusual frankness of 
his acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
"Many, many years ago, when I grew up in Los Angeles, it was people like the 
Sisters of Social Service who kept my life together," he said. "I'll never 
forget the help and direction I received." Baker said that as a young man, he 
decided the best way he could repay those who had guided him would be to "make 
money and contribute it back to society. Through my foundation, I will continue 
to help organizations that assist the poor and those who are a little 
mixed-up." 
</P>
<P>
Master of ceremonies Dan Mitrovich introduced Virginia Monday by expressing the 
frequently repeated maxim that what any charitable committee in difficulty 
requires is "a Virginia Monday." During a 30-year career in volunteer 
fund-raising, Monday has chaired the Blackstone Ball, 15 years of Andy Williams 
golf tournament galas and the final three COMBO galas. She will head the 
American Cancer Society's annual dinner next May. Praised as "a hands-on person 
who always gets involved," Monday accepted her award tearfully, simply saying, 
"This is a very special day for me." Later, she said she had prepared a more 
formal speech and forgotten every word of it when the moment came. "The words 
just fled. I didn't know it would be so emotional," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Capriccio provided one of its startling ramp shows for which it has become 
well-known. Before the show, proprietor Ollie McNamara said her store's 
participation was "Capriccio's contribution to the community and charity," 
adding, with a smile, "And hopefully, the ladies will come in to buy." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Kaveney chaired a committee that included Anne Brown, Mim Sally, Betty 
Tharp, Donna Guttman and Kay Rippee. Among the guests were Annette and Joe 
Fritzenkotter (who were surprised with a special "peer award" from the 
auxiliary), Jack Monday, Catherine McCormack, Howard Clayton Jr., Norma Shiner, 
Jeannie Rivkin, Yolanda Walther-Meade, Ann Jones, Betty Alexander, Nina 
Prestgard, Maggie Mazur, Audrey Geisel, Fran Golden, Joanne Hutchinson, Linda 
Alessio, Marilyn Young, Marian Bourland and Junko Cushman. 
</P>
<P>
LA JOLLA -- Jane and John Murphy found themselves crowded out of their bedroom 
-- if not quite their house -- by the hundred or so people who dropped by to 
inspect a collection of paintings by Manhattan Beach artist Bill Perkins, an 
animator at Walt Disney Pictures and godfather of one of the Murphy 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Murphy had complained before the Friday reception that "nearly everyone" 
on the guest list had plans to be out of town, but she still managed to rope 
together a fair slice of old La Jolla for the exhibit of seascapes and 
watercolors. Among them were Jane and Lou Metzger, Sarah Burton, John Barbey, 
Carolyn and Art Hooper, Nancy Hester, Judith and Steven Smith, and Richard 
Cramer. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Perkins said that the showing of about 30 paintings, many created on 
annual retreats to Catalina, was his first in three years. "It's a really nice 
opportunity to show in La Jolla," he said. "This is a very sophisticated 
audience." Perkins' appreciation of his audience was not diluted by the sale of 
several of his works. 
</P>
<P>
The guests took price lists with them on their wanderings through the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a caravan is going through," Jane Murphy said. "I didn't know we'd 
have paintings and people in our bedroom. But I love the paintings, and I want 
them all!" 
</P>
<P>
The guest list also included Elaine and Jim Triolo, Mary and Bob Allan, Kate 
and Glenn Kovary, Patrick Abarta, Ann and Chuck Montgomery, Dr. Willard 
VanderLaan, Barbara and Karl ZoBell, and Jim Bowers.

INTO THE NIGHT

The Scene: The West Coast premiere Tuesday night of "Heavy Petting" at the 
Director's Guild of America. The documentary intercuts clips of celebrities 
talking about their adolescent sexual experiences with scenes from real sex 
education, venereal disease and instructional films of the 1950s. A reception 
before the film benefited the International Documentary Foundation and was 
hosted by radio personality Dr. Demento. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Why, guests wondered, would anyone agree to discuss their teen sexual 
experiences on camera? Director Obie Benz explained: "A lot of people were 
nervous, and for good reason. But we interviewed 40 people, and got 30 hours of 
film. This is really all very tame stuff. I'm saving the rest of the footage in 
case there's a sequel -- which I'll call 'Heavier Petting.' " 
</P>
<P>
Who was there: Lots of vocal groups and singers from the '50s and '60s, 
including Richard Barry ("Louie Louie"); Jan, of Jan and Dean; Hank Ballard, of 
the Midnighters; Dick and Dee Dee; the Tokens ("The Lion Sleeps Tonight"); Tina 
Louise, of "Gilligan's Island"; and film star Kelly Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: The Del Rubio Triplets, the fantastic have-guitar-will-travel 
sister act from San Pedro, sang "Chain of Fools" and "These Boots Are Made for 
Walking." 
</P>
<P>
The Food: Caterers in '50s outfits sweated over a burger grill, a chili dog 
cart, bins of French fries bubbling in grease and bottles of flavored seltzer 
cooling in metal tubs of ice. For dessert, there were ice cream sandwiches, 
Drumsticks and candy baked beans. 
</P>
<P>
Dress code: Some guests actually dug out poodle skirts and leather jackets for 
the occasion, but most of the crowd seemed content to wear the usual screening 
attire: jackets and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "I'm one of Sandra Bernhard's managers, and I need to find the 
director," announced one extremely important person. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: The Del Rubio Triplets' version of "Chain of Fools" brought down the 
house. Guests also seemed impressed with the food, particularly the authentic 
childhood taste of the hamburgers, which didn't have any California touches 
like goat cheese or bean sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: Considering that the movie featured notables like William Burroughs, 
David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, and Allen Ginsberg, it would have been nice to 
see some of them at the party. KEVIN ALLMAN

PICCONE, ANNE HONORED AT GALA ENDING OF MART EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robin Piccone, who turned swimwear around three years ago with sexy neoprene 
swimsuits for Body Glove, emerged Tuesday night as the California Designer of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Piccone, wearing a Piccone-designed black chiffon duster and spaghetti-strap 
evening dress, thanked the audience of about 600 -- gathered in Santa Monica's 
Museum of Flying -- for the honor, which some industry observers thought was 
long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
In a light-handed reference to the fact she failed to win the honor last year, 
the internationally recognized queen of neoprene and head of a $10-million Los 
Angeles company said she had wondered if she might "always be a bridesmaid." 
</P>
<P>
There were no such fears expressed by Lisa Anne, winner of this year's Rising 
Star award. Just one year after launching her first collection, she took honors 
for a spring line dominated by well-structured linen blazers worn with flowing 
chiffon pants, either printed or pleated. 
</P>
<P>
The gala event marked the end of two days of nonstop fashion organized by the 
California Mart. Starting out at the Museum of Flying and then moving (via an 
endless flow of chartered buses) to a dramatic setting within the cavernous 
Gunnell Aviation hangar, the awards dinner was a $250-per-person affair to 
benefit the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
Among the celebrities present were Shari Belafonte-Harper, almost 
unrecognizable in a curly, long blond wig, and Jodie Foster, both of whom took 
to the podium to help honor the honorees, who included fashion photographer 
Matthew Rolston. A Lifetime Achievement award went to Levi Strauss and Co. 
executives Peter and Walter Hass. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, designers of surf- and swimwear had a chance to shine (even 
if the sun didn't) poolside at the Sheraton Grande Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In a showing of predominantly junior-oriented beachwear, companies such as 
Catalina, Cole, Beach Front Property, Jimmy'Z, Raisins and Take Cover indicated 
the shoreline next summer will be dotted with creative twists, including 
desert- and ethnic-inspired prints mixed with neon lime and pink. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more head-turning suits were Beten Gav's leather and pony-skin 
bikinis. Brenda Welch used gold coins, a shiny gold fabric decorated with black 
fleur-de-lis and crystals as decoration for a collection of outstanding 
maillots and bikinis.

LEGAL VIEW: FLAG CASE HIGHLIGHTS COURT PROCEDURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Will you please explain for me the difference between a code and a 
law of the federal government? Two recent events prompt me to ask -- the artist 
in Chicago putting the American flag on the floor of a museum, and the Supreme 
Court decision that the American flag may be burned. I called the office of my 
congressman to ask if what I learned in school when I was a child concerning 
the proper display of the flag was a law or merely custom. The code I was sent 
proved to me that the flag could not be put on a floor, nor could it be burned. 
-- C.B. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A code is a law and a law is a code, until a court says it isn't. If 
that sounds confusing, let me give you a basic primer in the way our legal 
system works. 
</P>
<P>
The legislature, be it state or federal, passes bills, which, when signed by 
the chief executive, become laws. They are also called statutes or even codes. 
The statutes are printed in code books. That's why you'll hear references to 
the California Code of Civil Procedure, a collection of certain state laws, or 
the United States Code, which is a collection of all the federal statutes -- 
passed by Congress and signed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
These statutes are then interpreted by the courts. But judges don't just go out 
and pick a statute to interpret. Judges hear cases, and they only do that 
either when people sue each other or the government prosecutes a criminal 
action against an accused. Whatever laws happen to be at the crux of the cases 
they hear are the laws that will be interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
During a court's review of a case, judges apply the statutes to the particular 
facts before them. Let's take the simplest example. Suppose a statute says it 
is illegal to drive a "motor vehicle" in certain areas. If the statute has not 
defined "motor vehicle" precisely enough, a court may have to decide whether it 
applies to a motorized tricycle or go-cart. And whatever they decide becomes 
the law within their jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Written Decisions 
</P>
<P>
As a case moves up the appellate process, written decisions are issued by the 
various appeals courts, and these decisions are also part of the law. They are 
known as common law or case law. But even the appellate judges who decide the 
cases may disagree. The majority decision, which is joined by the majority of 
the justices on a particular court, contains the "holding" of the court and 
should be followed in the future by lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
However, the reasoning in the dissenting opinions may still be used later by 
lawyers or judges in different cases with different facts. And it is even 
possible that years later, the dissenting view may become the majority view if 
the holding of the earlier case is rejected. That wouldn't mean the decision in 
the earlier case would be reversed, but the court could decide that the 
decision is no longer the law. (Now perhaps you'll understand why it takes 
three years to finish law school.) 
</P>
<P>
There is one more crucial element in our legal system, and it relates directly 
to your question: the Constitution. The U.S. Constitution is the highest law, 
the law that towers above all else. Neither a state nor the federal legislature 
can pass a law that conflicts with the Constitution. Well, actually that's not 
quite right. They can pass a law, which they may think does not violate the 
Constitution. But the judiciary has the final say on whether a statute 
conflicts with the Constitution. And the U.S. Supreme Court has the final word. 
</P>
<P>
The code section that your congressman sent you contained a provision that made 
it a crime to burn or desecrate the flag. But in June, the Supreme Court 
decided in a 5 to 4 vote that the statute conflicted with the free speech 
guarantees of the First Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment," wrote Justice 
William J. Brennan Jr. for the majority, "it is that the government may not 
prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself 
offensive or disagreeable." 
</P>
<P>
So what you learned in school about flag burning was the law, not just custom. 
It's just no longer the law, because the Supreme Court ruled it was 
unconstitutional.

SLAMMERS PINS HOPES ON WRESTLING SCHOOL, GYM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, Lustig is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Want to wrestle with a weighty problem? Want to learn how to wrestle with a 
weighty problem? 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a wrestling buff you love to wrestle, and you run out of lawns and 
living rooms; you get thrown out of the house, and you have to find a place," 
said Verne Langdon, 47. So, Langdon created Slammers Wrestling Gym in Sun 
Valley. He says it will be the first of its kind in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He has invited about 50 luminaries of the wrestling field to a grand opening 
Friday, and the gym is scheduled to open to the public the first week of 
October. 
</P>
<P>
"There are tennis clubs, volleyball courts, football fields, baseball diamonds 
and even roller rinks," said Langdon, a tall, muscular, blond-maned man with 
pearly white teeth and giant hands that could most assuredly make zucchini 
squash out of any pencil-necked geek who got in his way. 
</P>
<P>
Slammers, housed in a unit of an industrial warehouse complex on Branford 
Street, materialized after Langdon saw the need for a place where pros and 
amateurs could work out and train between matches, as well as a need for a 
professional wrestling school in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we wrestlers don't have to take a back seat anymore. No more wrestling in 
the grass or knocking over somebody's heirloom gimcrack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dean of Education' 
</P>
<P>
Langdon, a producer and writer in the motion picture and record businesses, 
said his partner Wesley Eure will operate the gym, but that it will be 
professional wrestler Lillian Ellison who will be the principal trainer and 
"dean of education." 
</P>
<P>
Better known as "the Fabulous Moolah" and giving her age only as "14 years 
older than my daughter," Ellison started training when she was 12 and turned 
pro three years later. She says she never looked back. Today she owns "Camp 
Moolah," a wrestling school in South Carolina, and laughs easily about her 
33-year-old career and her plans for Slammers. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting inside the taped area of what will become the wrestling ring, she said, 
"I'm going to be teaching everybody how to wrestle." The clamor of workmen 
putting finishing touches on the walls and ceiling made her pause a moment. 
"It'll be the real style of wrestling. Professional holds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started, I weighed 100 pounds, and everybody told me I wasn't 
going to make it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire in her eye confirms that her passion for wrestling hasn't diminished 
over the years, despite having suffered a broken neck, broken collarbones 
(including a compound fracture), fingers, toes, a dislocated knee, a dislocated 
shoulder and numerous broken ribs during her career. "They said I wasn't going 
to make it," she repeated, "but I did." 
</P>
<P>
The Moolah's knowledge will be imparted in a course designed for men, women and 
children in sessions five days a week for three months or three days a week for 
six months. The cost is expected to be about $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
"I do it because I enjoy it, and I know what a hard time I had getting 
started," she said. "There's so many girls and men who want to get started and 
don't know how, and there's not many promoters who will help newcomers get 
started." A mention of mud wrestling in Hollywood doesn't sit well. "Mud 
wrestling," she replied curtly, "is not wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
For Langdon, the school represents a dream come true. "I've wanted to do 
something like this since I was a kid," he said, remembering when his father 
took him to the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. "The cigar smoke, beer and 
popcorn smells, the American Legion band playing "The Star-Spangled Banner. I 
love the wrestling and the stars of today, but wrestling at the Civic and being 
there with my dad those nights, it just beat everything." The experience, he 
said, instilled in him the thrill of the sport forever. 
</P>
<P>
Langdon said he spent three months looking for a building. "I thought the 
difficult thing would be to get the ring. But that was easy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finding Right Spot 
</P>
<P>
The building needed ceilings at least 10 1/2 feet high. And many places turned 
him down after hearing of his plans. A standard response was, "We're really not 
interested in having something like you in our building," Langdon said. It came 
together for him, however, in Sun Valley, with a combination of the right 
building, roof height and price. And, he said, "It's not too far from my home." 
</P>
<P>
Langdon and the Fabulous Moolah insist that there is a big difference between a 
wrestling gym and one used for boxing. 
</P>
<P>
In wrestling, the ring is a bit smaller and there are three ropes instead of 
the four used in boxing rings. Rope work, Ellison said, is very important in 
wrestling. Wrestlers need to bounce off the ropes and if they're not careful 
they'll go through them. 
</P>
<P>
At Slammers, mats for Greco-Roman style wrestling will also be provided. A hall 
of fame will display tapes, photos, films and books on some of wrestling's 
greats: for example, Gorgeous George, the Torres Brothers and Mr. Moto, and 
current heavyweights Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's All Work' 
</P>
<P>
Langdon and the Fabulous Moolah scoff at the suggestion that wrestling is pure 
put-on. 
</P>
<P>
"People get confused about the shows," Ellison said. "My robe and attire, 
that's my show. And I show it off when I get into the ring. But when I disrobe, 
there's no show; it's all work. Like any other 
</P>
<P>
professional sport, wrestling has to be entertainment, too, otherwise everybody 
is going to fall asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Langdon agreed. "It's not easy to learn, and it's not easy to know the holds. 
It's not easy to get out of something that someone else has got you in that 
hurts a lot. It's tough, and it's tough to learn," he said, pulling up his left 
pants leg to show an 8-inch scar where someone fell on him the wrong way, 
shattering his leg so badly it took 16 permanent screws to put it back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Langdon said he welcomes anyone who likes to wrestle: amateurs, professionals, 
novices or fans. Even wimps. "Everyone except Pee-wee Herman," he said with a 
laugh, then quickly changed his mind. "Nah, Pee-wee can come, too."

SHELTERED PETS; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A SLOW, EXACTING PROCESS WHEN CLUB TAKES ON CARE, ADOPTION OF TURTLES, 
TORTOISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY, Mackey is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a busy day, things can get really slow around Jan Gordon's house. 
</P>
<P>
She has been known to have more than 30 turtles and tortoises in her Sylmar 
back yard, all of them looking to her for food, shelter and, yes, comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"Gardeners are notorious for leaving gates open, and people find lost tortoises 
walking down the street all the time," said Gordon, who for the last six years 
has been adoption coordinator for the California Turtle and Tortoise Club's San 
Fernando Valley chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"The animal shelters have our phone number, the zoo has our number and any time 
they get a tortoise they don't know what to do with, they turn it in to us." 
</P>
<P>
Formed 25 years ago to provide information on the proper care of various 
species of turtles and tortoises, the club has six Southern California chapters 
and nearly 2,500 members. Groups meet monthly, Gordon said, and also work in 
cooperation with the state Department of Fish and Game to place endangered 
tortoises in people's homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supply and Demand 
</P>
<P>
This tortoise "adoption" is a major focus of the club. Finding homes for the 
reptiles -- some of which weigh more than 50 pounds -- isn't difficult. "The 
average wait for a California desert tortoise is one year, and there's a 
four-year wait for females," Gordon said. (Other types of tortoises are in 
demand, Gordon said, but none is as sought-after as the California desert 
tortoise.) To encourage breeding, she added, female desert tortoises are only 
placed in homes where there already is a male. 
</P>
<P>
Although the club has had the policy for some time, members say it is even more 
important now because the California desert tortoise was placed on the 
endangered species list by Fish and Game in July. Last week the federal Bureau 
of Land Management quarantined 37,700 acres in the Mojave Desert to protect the 
tortoises. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been dying off by the thousands," said Marc Graff, a Los Angeles 
psychiatrist and president of the club's Valley chapter. "Part of it has been 
due to developers and off-road vehicles, but a lot of people have brought them 
back from the desert and then didn't know how to care for them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the uprooted tortoises developed a respiratory disease -- the possible 
result of smog -- and many were then taken back to the desert when their owners 
no longer wanted them, Graff said. Soon, the respiratory disease spread to 
other desert tortoises. "They've been dropping like flies," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than place the California desert tortoises back into their natural 
habitat, club members ask that they be turned in to the club. They also stress 
the importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Homes 
</P>
<P>
"They're becoming like the condor and that's why captive breeding is so 
important," Gordon said, adding that homes with unfenced swimming pools, 
aggressive dogs or easily escapable yards would probably be ruled out as good 
homes. "We have to protect these guys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After a California desert tortoise is placed in a new home, Gordon said, the 
owner fills out a permit that is mailed to Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The California desert tortoise, which cannot be legally sold in pet stores, 
isn't the only species in trouble. Many of the more exotic tortoise species 
have been threatened by the worldwide destruction of rain forests. Their 
numbers, too, are dwindling. "Three years ago we had all kinds of tortoises. 
Now it's extremely difficult to get ahold of any of them," said Michael 
Gutierrez, manager of the Pet Emporium in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Some South American tortoises, which Gutierrez said were easily found five 
years ago, can now cost $800 in pet stores. Greek tortoises, which sold for $65 
three years ago, now cost $275, he said. A 5-inch pancake tortoise from South 
America sells for $90 at Pet Emporium. "The stock market went down, but the 
tortoise market has gone up," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Fee 
</P>
<P>
The club, however, does not charge for tortoise adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
Although many club members breed turtles or tortoises, Graff said most did not 
join for that reason. Most simply needed more information on how to care for 
their pet and heard about the club through the turtle grapevine -- pet owners, 
pet stores and club members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out from Boston to go to law school and I brought my two tortoises with 
me. When one of them got sick, though, I realized I was just flying by the seat 
of my pants," said Michele MacDonald, a Silver Lake attorney who discovered the 
club two months ago. "I've found out some things not to do and have gotten some 
good advice from other turtle lovers." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Connors, a UCLA biochemist whose Reseda home is the stomping ground for 40 
turtles and tortoises, learned some similar lessons early on. While still a 
student, Connors kept several tortoises in his Santa Monica apartment. 
Uncertain of what to feed them, he put them on a typical college student's 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pizza for Tortoises 
</P>
<P>
"I used to feed them pizza," he said, smiling somewhat sheepishly. "It wasn't 
the best possible diet for them." 
</P>
<P>
So just what is it, newcomers inevitably ask, that catches a turtle's culinary 
fancy? It depends on the species, comes the inevitable answer. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who has box turtles and California desert tortoises, as well as several 
exotic species -- including a diamond-speckled Greek tortoise and a red-nosed 
variety called the red leg tortoise -- says that just like with people, tastes 
among tortoises vary. As a result, she added, pleasing their palates can be 
time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
"I go outside every morning and it can take me two hours just to feed them 
all," she said. "Desert tortoises are vegetarians, and so I'll feed them peas, 
carrots, corn, lettuce, hibiscus flowers and dandelions. Red legs tend to like 
fruit more. Box turtles like snails and earthworms." 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget about varying that menu. "Tortoises get bored with the same 
thing day after day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Learning 
</P>
<P>
Betty Alice Kinder, secretary of the club's Valley chapter, said she has been 
around tortoises since she was a child and is still learning things. Sixty 
years ago, she said, the tortoise her mother found along the California 
Aqueduct became a member of the family. Kinder had the tortoise as a pet until 
its death last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was operated on for bladder stones," she said, a touch of sadness in her 
voice. "But I guess she was just old." 
</P>
<P>
Club members point out that, with the proper care, many tortoises can outlive 
their owners. Desert tortoises can live to be 100. Box turtles, which can grow 
larger than a man's fist, can live to age 40 or 50. Galapagos tortoises, which 
often resemble slowly moving boulders and can weigh several hundred pounds, may 
live to be older than 150. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect mine to be around a long time," Gordon said. "I put them in my will 
for my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Not all questions the group hears have to do with eating habits or illnesses, 
though. Susan Lockhart of Reseda joined the club in 1985 when she was given a 
tortoise and didn't know how to care for it. Now she has a different problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Mean One 
</P>
<P>
"I just got this European tortoise, and he's a mean one. He bites my other 
tortoises and I'm not sure what to do with him," Lockhart said at the club's 
annual chapterwide meeting, held recently at Casa de Tortuga (Spanish for 
"Turtle House") in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Without a doubt, Casa de Tortuga is a fitting place for the gathering. Owned by 
retired businessman Walter Allen, the house, tucked away on a residential 
street and resembling the homes next to it, is literally wall-to-wall turtles 
and tortoises. Allen, who lives in another home he owns next door, converted 
the residence several years ago for the benefit of the several hundred 
tortoises he has adopted over the years. Among the residents are two Galapagos 
tortoises named Daphne and Darwin -- Daphne is on permanent loan from the 
Honolulu Zoo -- that take up a large portion of one fenced lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Running pools in the back yard hold at least 100 water turtles, each one the 
size of a dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you remember the tiny, flat water turtles you got as a kid that always died 
within a week?" Connors asked as he looked into the pool. "Well, these are the 
same kind. It's just that very few people knew how to care for them properly." 
But Connors added of Allen: "He has it down to a fine art." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Devoted Fans 
</P>
<P>
What is it about turtles and tortoises that arouses such devotion and interest? 
</P>
<P>
Some members say it is because tortoises are clean and don't shed like cats or 
dogs. Others are intrigued by a species that socialized with the dinosaurs. 
Gordon cites the affectionate nature of one 80-year-old tortoise that likes to 
fall asleep on her foot. Graff likes the way his tortoise scratches at the back 
door when she wants to come in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say they are particularly intelligent," Graff said. "But they hold 
your interest." 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the group itself. Members say the meetings give them a chance 
to meet interesting people with varied backgrounds, with only one thing that 
bonds them all. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of warmth and a lot of friendly people," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of atmosphere, it would seem, that could bring even the shyest types 
out of their shells.

"I know absolutely nothing about it, but I know it's the future. In fact, it's 
here right now," enthuses Albert Marley, superintendent of the Las Virgenes 
School District. He is speaking of the robotics program at Calabasas High 
School's department of industrial technology. 
</P>
<P>
Explains department Chairman (and instructor) Sharony Berger, "What we are 
attempting to establish here is called CAD/CAM/CIM Robotics. It means 
computer-assisted design and drafting, computer-assisted manufacturing and 
computer-integrated manufacturing." 
</P>
<P>
OK, what does it really mean? "Industrially they use robots for welding, 
painting or picking and placing items, for example. We teach the elements of 
programming the computer, which in turn will control the robot. Ultimately the 
robot will be used to perform certain operations. So you learn sequencing and 
timing systems to allow this to happen," Berger elaborated. 
</P>
<P>
Robot instruction began last year at Calabasas High, but this fall the school 
will be using a new and larger teaching robot. "Student interest is very, very 
high," Berger reported, with 42 students enrolled in the program. 
</P>
<P>
The program is two years away from being fully developed. The next robot to 
join the family will be a computer-controlled, pneumatically operated one for 
about $3,500. Part of the proceeds from the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce 
tournament Oct. 16 at the Calabasas Golf and Country Club will be donated to 
the robotics program, and the school should be able to buy the new robot after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction, a Growth Business 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who is in the construction business should just have 'Two Weeks and 
$1,000' printed right on their business card," jokes Bob Petrilak, owner of 
Reliable Custom Plumbing in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners who want a little work done on their house soon find out that "two 
weeks and $1,000" is usually what it takes to get a small job done. Invariably, 
two weeks stretches to four, and the $1,000 doubles to $2,000. Complaining 
about the contractor has been elevated to an art form by some homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't always the contractor's fault for missing the deadline. Small jobs 
have a way of multiplying around the house. "People start saying, 'Well, while 
we're at it, we might as well do this too' and projects spread like crabgrass," 
Petrilak noted. "I've worked on jobs that started out as a bathroom remodel and 
the people ended up gutting the whole house." 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, makes the contractor late for the next job. "I always try to 
accommodate people if they ask for extra work while I'm there because I don't 
want to have to come back later. It's easier to get it all done while you're 
set up there," explained finish carpenter Erik Sydow, of Erik Sydow's Wood 
Specialties in West Hills. "Then I explain it to my next customer and they 
usually understand -- especially later on when I start their job and then they 
want extra work done." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of people, Sydow noted, want to do more work after he starts a 
job. "I had one $8,000 job that grew to a $40,000 job," he recalled. "I'd like 
more jobs like that!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adults With Class 
</P>
<P>
Adults in the San Fernando Valley are going back to school in droves this fall, 
taking non-credit classes that run the gamut from "The Diabetic Family" (Pierce 
College Community Services) to "Being Single or Divorced in the San Fernando 
Valley" (Los Angeles Valley College), "Introduction to Mountain Biking" (The 
Learning Tree) to "Traditional Bookbinding" (UCLA Extension, San Fernando 
Valley). 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at these schools agree that enrollment is highest during the 
fall semester -- Pierce will have 10,000 to 12,000 students in adult classes 
alone. Many schools add the bulk of their new classes at this time. "We brought 
in over a hundred new courses for September," said Christy Wilson, program 
director at The Learning Tree, Chatsworth campus. "This is when we try to get 
them going for the year." 
</P>
<P>
Many people take classes to explore new business or career opportunities. A 
popular course at The Learning Tree teaches studio makeup to students. Among 
the 375 non-credit classes at Pierce College are "Civil Service Preparation to 
be a Postal Worker" and "How to Become a Balloon Artist" as well as a class in 
assembling gift baskets, said spokeswoman Virginia Miessner. 
</P>
<P>
Among Pierce College's offbeat classes are "Strollering" (in which mothers with 
babies meet to walk around the campus) and "4-Wheel Drives: What's Perfect for 
You?" 
</P>
<P>
Schools select class offerings based upon interest. Valley residents appear to 
be keen on courses covering interior design, writing, dance, languages and 
personal relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting very good enrollment in a class called "Cities of Destiny: 
Moments of Glory in Western Civilization," noted UCLA spokeswoman Beth Hill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chambers of Change 
</P>
<P>
"Chambers of commerce have evolved into being business-advocate groups. They're 
not so service-oriented as they used to be," observes Sandra Dack, executive 
director of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce, one of about 26 chambers in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They may spend 40% of their time on public-policy issues -- including 
legislative matters -- and 35% on business and economic development matters, 
and only 25% on community kinds of things," Dack continued. 
</P>
<P>
Because local issues frequently traverse community boundaries, the various 
chambers communicate more intensively with one another nowadays. "Before, the 
chambers stood as islands. Now we have a much bigger view on every issue -- 
from transportation to waste management, for example -- that we have to ask how 
we can work together to solve the problems," said Louise Marquez, manager of 
the Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The public still clings to the old idea of the chamber as an information 
clearinghouse, even if their question is not specific to the community. "I had 
a woman call asking me what was the safest car seat to buy for her infant," 
recalled Barbara Scruggs, executive manager of the Calabasas Chamber of 
Commerce, with a laugh.

SEARCH, RESCUE SCOUTS THRIVE IN NORTHWEST

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rugged, forested mountains of the Pacific Northwest beckon droves of hikers 
and hunters. When they get lost, the county sheriff doesn't call out the dogs 
-- he mobilizes an Explorer search-and-rescue post. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Oregon have 24 of the nation's 117 such Scout posts -- with 
nearly 30% of the 1,800 members. 
</P>
<P>
The Northwest terrain makes the region a hotbed of good programs, said Forrest 
McVicar, associate director of the Boy Scouts of America Exploring Division. 
</P>
<P>
Search-and-rescue Scouts -- ages 14 to 20 -- get a chance to learn outdoor 
skills and serve their communities in a very practical way, said Sgt. Gary 
Lewis of the sheriff's office in Lane County, Ore., who has advised Post 178 
since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"They're on the front line," Lewis said. They may be on a mission overnight and 
may get called from school. 
</P>
<P>
Student members have to maintain good grades, and they sometimes elect to give 
up other activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skipped Concert 
</P>
<P>
"We've had kids forgo a rock concert to go on a rescue," said John Pitetti, 38, 
an associate adviser who joined the post when he was 14. "And one skipped 
football practice and endured the wrath of the coach." 
</P>
<P>
The point of the Explorer program is to learn about possible careers. Training 
in a search-and-rescue post is more hands-on than in most Explorer programs. 
Scouts get extensive practice using camping and communication skills, map and 
compass knowledge, and thorough search techniques. More important, they 
practice teamwork and leadership in situations in which their performance can 
have life-or-death consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"We train outdoors October through March, when the weather is the worst," said 
Doug Caley, operations director of King County Explorer Search and Rescue in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"And we do it in the Cascades, where the rainfall is more than double what it 
is in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
Search-and-rescue graduates often go into some phase of forestry or related 
fields, such as insurance safety, radio communications or paramedical service. 
Many continue as program advisers or community volunteers, such as Pitetti, who 
is also a volunteer scuba diver for the sheriff, or Caley, who joined the Boy 
Scouts at 11 and the Explorers at 14. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Give Them Responsibility' 
</P>
<P>
"Society mistrusts teen-agers," Caley said. "But when you give them 
responsibility like this, they live up to it." 
</P>
<P>
Scouts on a mission -- about 40% are female -- are serious, whether they are 
searching for lost people or for evidence, or providing support for special 
professional search or rescue teams, such as the ski patrol or dog tracking 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Spencer is a good example. In 3 years, she has been on 36 missions. 
</P>
<P>
One started at dawn on a Monday in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The call had come Sunday about 7 p.m.: Hiker last seen about half a mile up 
French Pete Creek, female, 28, retarded, lightly clothed. Had a fight with her 
boyfriend Saturday and tried to patch it up Sunday by going for a hike. The 
boyfriend went back to the car to get a camera and, when he returned, Charlotte 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Or so he said. How big a fight was it? Why did he wait 9 hours to report her 
missing? And what about the 12 arrests and five convictions on his record? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Slowly 
</P>
<P>
Lois, 18, led a team of four up the trail slowly, so as not to miss any subtle 
sign. They only covered 1 1/2 miles in 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Then, 50 feet from a footbridge, she saw a faint scratch in the dirt that 
looked like an arrow. Across the creek, a woman bent to get a drink. Lois 
crossed the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello," she said. "What's your name?" 
</P>
<P>
"Charlotte," the woman said, and she laughed and cried at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"I could just see the tension drain from her," Lois said. "Did I feel good! 
Each of our teams had a radio, and the posse was standing by." 
</P>
<P>
Although new search-and-rescue Explorer posts invariably have to prove their 
abilities, once they have, they receive high praise. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Howard Kershner, the Lane County sheriff's officer who worked with Post 178 
from the time it was formed in 1962 until he retired last year, would rather 
use Scouts than adult volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell them to do something and they do it," he said. "We've had kids go 
through blackberry thickets 10 feet high. I can guarantee you that if they 
don't find something, it isn't there."

Suits &amp; Countersuits: Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine have filed 
a lawsuit against their former agents for $1.5 million after being removed from 
the lineup of last year's Amnesty International concert tour. The suit, filed 
in U.S. District Court, says the group rejected offers for $500,000 in 
appearances and recording sessions to clear their schedule for the tour, before 
the Los Angeles-based firm of Moress-Nanas canceled their engagement at the 
last minute. The suit also is seeking $1 million in punitive damages. Philip 
Ryan, Moress-Nanas' attorney, called the suit "a joke." He said the group was 
dropped from the tour when Bruce Springsteen wanted to perform 90-minute sets 
instead of the 20 minutes originally planned. Ryan claimed that the real issue 
is the nearly $1 million the group owes their former agents. Moress-Nanas 
already had filed a suit in Federal Court accusing the Sound Machine of failing 
to pay $750,000 in management fees and $200,000 for the agency's work in 
securing a $2-million CBS record deal. ALEENE MacMINN

Gov. Bob Miller of Nevada joined entertainer Wayne Newton this week in trying 
to get a settlement in the summer-long dispute between hotels and musicians 
that has forced several stars to cancel their Las Vegas engagements. Miller's 
entrance into the talks came a week after Newton brought the two sides back to 
the bargaining table to try and break the impasse that has darkened showrooms 
at three major resorts and seen picket lines at two others. "My position has 
been just to keep everybody talking," said Newton, who lives in Las Vegas and 
is a big attraction in the hotel showrooms there. Last week, he refused to 
cross picket lines at the Las Vegas Hilton.ALEENE MacMINN

HOWARD ROSENBERG: WITHOUT REGRET, NEW HEROES CONTINUE TO DO IT 'THEIR WAY'

The new season continues tonight with more gritty fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
First comes bottom-of-the-barrel "Top of the Hill," a CBS series getting a 
two-hour premiere at 9 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. Meanwhile, NBC checks in with 
the lowball "Hardball," which premieres in 90-minute form at 9:30 p.m. on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39. Its regular time slot is 9 p.m. Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
Both series center on stock television characters -- mavericks who reject 
convention in favor of doing things Their Way. 
</P>
<P>
In "Top of the Hill," Thomas Bell's way is tedious, absolutely absurd and 
relentlessly banal. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from winning an election to complete the unexpired congressional term of 
his ailing father (Dick O'Neill), young Bell (William Katt) arrives in 
Washington in his truck, looking like someone who thinks that lobbyists are 
people who hang out in foyers of hotels. 
</P>
<P>
He may be dumb, but he has ideals. So no hanging around the office and learning 
Congress for Bell. He has barely unpacks his duffle bag when he's off to Costa 
Verde, a Latin American nation where a powerful drug lord is suspected of 
holding a United States drug-enforcement agent whose father is one of Bell's 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bell is determined to free the agent, there are obstacles. Not only is 
Bell temporarily jailed, but his meeting with the brutal drug kingpin seems 
fruitless. Then the action congressman -- drawing on his experience as a surfer 
who used to book rock bands into discos -- applies The Pressure. He calls his 
office and asks his secretary: 
</P>
<P>
"Who do we know with connections?" 
</P>
<P>
Is this rich or what? The ease with which Bell prevails in executive producer 
Stephen J. Cannell's script seems all the more ludicrous in light of present 
reality -- the entire U.S. government's apparent helplessness in restraining 
Colombia's drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
The only bright spot in "Top of the Hill" is the late Kenneth McMillan as the 
tough party whip who makes Bell pay a price for his assistance. But this is 
politics? It's difficult to believe that Bell would run for office, even more 
difficult to believe that he would win. 
</P>
<P>
Politics is supposed to be the art of compromise. In the case of "Top of the 
Hill," television is compromise minus the art. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Hardball," on the other hand, is a case of style and potentially 
interesting protagonists only occasionally being enough to energize formula TV. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged detective Charlie (C.B.) Battles (John Ashton) is balding and wears 
a back brace and permanent scowl. He rejects suggestions that he take a desk 
job or retire. 
</P>
<P>
Cocky young Detective Joe (Kaz) Kaczierowski (Richard Tyson) wears his long, 
stringy hair in a ponytail except for one strand that hangs in his face, keeps 
a shotgun strapped to his arm and rides a Harley. 
</P>
<P>
Both cops are rebels. 
</P>
<P>
C.B. does things His Way. Kaz does things His Way. 
</P>
<P>
They meet when assigned to guard a witness who is hiding out with her young son 
before testifying against a mobster. They discover Their Ways clash. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be no cop," says C.B., who groans about getting a partner with hair 
like Yoko Ono's. "I wanted hair like yours," Kaz snaps back, "but I couldn't 
get the part that wide." 
</P>
<P>
"The way you two bicker, you sound like an old married couple," says the 
witness, Connie Villanova (Kay Lenz), who happens to be the mobster's wife and 
C.B.'s former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson is refreshingly off-beat, and he and Ashton are fun together and perform 
well when given the opportunity. However, they're undermined by co-executive 
producer Frank Lupo's weak script, one whose infrequent glimmers of logic and 
intelligence are eclipsed by enormous flaws. 
</P>
<P>
The peril and suspense here are artificial and the witness-protection program 
so inept as to be laughable. In one instance, C.B. and Kaz frantically rush 
across town to warn Connie and two other cops with her that she's in danger, 
when all they have to do is call them on the phone. In another instance, a mob 
infiltrator makes a big production of leaving Connie's apartment in order to 
sneak back and try to kill her. Why leave and sneak back? Why not kill her 
immediately? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the only thing longer than Kaz's hair is the ankle-length coat he 
wears while on his motorcycle. He's already taking a chance by forsaking a 
helmet, but wearing a coat that could get tangled in the wheels would seem to 
be especially foolhardy. Maybe if he wore his coat in a ponytail. . . .

'TIME' SURVEYS RESEARCH ON NATURAL RHYTHMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are many manifestations of the ancient conflict between humans and 
nature, but one that may not come immediately to mind is the human tinkering 
with time. It's a conflict that has a direct physical cost, as any late-summer 
traveler suffering from jet lag can tell you. "The Time of Our Lives," an 
unexpectedly incisive look at time and the biological clock (at 8 tonight on 
KCET Channel 28), tells us this, and more. 
</P>
<P>
For example, jet lag normally takes a full week's recovery time. The disastrous 
accidents at Bhopal, Chernobyl and Valdez all occurred in the pre-dawn hours, 
when body rhythms and alertness are at their lowest ebb. One week after 
daylight saving time always marks an increase in car accidents. There is a 
group of people, diagnosed as victims of seasonal affective disorder, who react 
to changes of seasons with food and sleep binges and general depression. 
</P>
<P>
A recent wing of biological science has even emerged to study these phenomena 
and the causes and cures of time-related disorders: chronobiology. "The Time of 
Our Lives" ultimately emerges as a survey of chronobiology. 
</P>
<P>
With producer-writer Roger Bingham as a breezy, intelligent guide, this KCET 
production also becomes a parable on how a problem caused by the technological 
revolution can be itself solved by technology. Our natural body clock, 
organically calibrated on a circadian cycle (roughly 25 hours), was an 
unexplored area until jet planes arrived and electricity permitted the 
graveyard shift. The body can adapt to much, but not, it was found, to radical 
shifts in time. 
</P>
<P>
A guest claims that when labor reaches a sufficient point of automation, thus 
eliminating the need for graveyard shifts, society may return to the natural 
rhythms of a bygone day. Such hyper-mechanization -- if it happens at all -- 
will surely, though, unleash its own problems. Bingham doesn't address this 
here; perhaps next time.

CIOPPINO CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AVILA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica's Ocean Ave Seafood won the first cioppino contest staged in this 
seafaring town, indicating that what started as a San Francisco specialty may 
be more at home in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Another Southern California restaurant, John Dominis of Newport Beach, came in 
third, while second place went to the Spyglass Inn of Shell Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cioppino is a robust fisherman's stew based on the day's catch rather than any 
set formula. Tomatoes, olive oil, herbs and wine are standard ingredients, and 
shellfish usually predominate. Introduced decades ago by Italians and 
Portuguese working off the northern coast, cioppino has become linked to 
Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Because no restaurant from that tourist attraction took part in the contest 
(two canceled), judges could not determine whether San Francisco had lost its 
culinary grip. 
</P>
<P>
The competition took place on neutral terrain, about midway between San 
Francisco and Los Angeles. The site was the Olde Port Inn on the pier at Port 
San Luis. However, restaurant manager Leonard Cohen was not out to start a 
North-South rivalry. "I wanted everybody to win," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Entries were judged for aroma, flavor, creativity, presentation and overall 
quality. Ocean Ave Seafood scored high in still another area, thoughtfulness. 
Cioppino is messy to eat, and sticky-fingered judges were delighted by the 
entry's accompaniments: finger bowls and wet towels topped with lemon slices. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Mullarney, Ocean Ave chef, made the dish spicy with black pepper and 
crushed hot red peppers. But the mellow broth was also amply seasoned with 
fresh herbs, porcini mushrooms, tomatoes and aromatic vegetables such as fennel 
root. Large white individual serving bowls were piled high with Dungeness crab, 
clams, large spot prawns and swordfish substituting for albacore, which the 
restaurant had not been able to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
For dunking, Mullarney provided sourdough bread -- not the celebrated San 
Francisco variety but a hometown product from the Pioneer Boulangerie in Santa 
Monica. And for drinking, he presented a bottle of Sanford Pinot Noir 1986, the 
same wine that flavored the sauce. "I thought it married well with the 
tomatoes," Mullarney said. 
</P>
<P>
The wine was a savvy choice because the contest was accompanied by a tasting of 
Central Coast Pinot Noirs. Cohen, a wine enthusiast, considers Pinot Noir the 
ideal accompaniment to cioppino and had dubbed the event a "Cio-Pinot" cookoff. 
</P>
<P>
What is poured into the pot can vary, however. "White wine gives leaner, 
crisper flavor," said Cohen, who sometimes adds both white and red wines and 
uses all Pinot Noir only for special occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Murphy, chef of the second place Spyglass Inn, seasoned his cioppino with 
dry vermouth while Robert Reash Jr. of John Dominis used a dry white wine. 
Chardonnay went into a full-bodied Sicilian-style cioppino prepared by 
Stephanie Ciambra-Ball of Genovese's Italian Restaurant in Grover City. Ed Diaz 
of the Yankee Clipper restaurant in Ventura added Chenin Blanc for sweetness. 
And Joe Zoellin of Flaherty's in Carmel finished off his stew with a splash of 
Port, apparent only in the first whiff when the lid of the pot was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
From its start as a simple seaman's supper, cioppino has advanced to a luxury 
dish with, occasionally, some surprising ingredients. The Spyglass Inn prize 
winner, presented in an elaborately carved, footed silver tureen, was packed 
with enormous prawns, lobster, scallops with the roe attached, cockles, clams 
and albacore. The John Dominis entry, served in gleaming copper-and-brass 
casseroles, also contained a wide range of costly seafood and combined such 
contemporary California seasonings as cilantro and jalapeno chile with saffron, 
which is a classic component of French bouillabaisse. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest A. Wally of Chef Wally's Bistro in San Diego produced what may be the 
state's only cioppino containing shark fins. Wally also added barquetta bass 
cheeks, lobster, rock crab claws, halibut, swordfish, sculpin and skate wings, 
all fresh from the San Diego area. Although the entry did not place in the top 
three, it boasted one of the most well-balanced broths. 
</P>
<P>
Vienna-born Wally, who has worked in Australia and Hong Kong, startled the 
judges by adding a side dish of highly seasoned, Indian-style tomato chutney. 
The chutney was meant to go with thin slices of firm bread, not the cioppino. 
</P>
<P>
Ciambra-Ball topped Genovese's cioppino with basil sprigs and accompanied it 
with sourdough bread lushly seasoned with Sicilian olive oil, butter, garlic, 
Parmesan cheese and Italian parsley. As if that weren't enough, she added 
little pots of intensely flavored pesto. Although her cioppino came in fourth, 
Ciambra-Ball won first place for creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Another idea for dunking was warm olive oil seasoned with fresh basil. This 
accompanied the Dominis cioppino. Most of the chefs served sourdough or crusty 
French breads, but Eugen Kunstmann of Jagermeister in Arroyo Grande offered 
slices of Bavarian rye bread. Kunstmann, who is from Bad Kissingen, a health 
resort in Germany, entered a mild cioppino with distinctively German 
ingredients. Among these were celery root and leaves from his home garden in 
Santa Maria, and parsnips. In addition to Port wine, Kunstmann added 
Jagermeister liqueur, an herbal-flavored concoction produced south of the 
Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
The panel of judges took four hours to assess the merits of the eight 
cioppinos. The $50 a ticket tasting that followed was a benefit for the San 
Luis Obispo County Unit of the American Cancer Society. Wineries that 
participated were Wild Horse, Meridian, Creston Manor, Talley, Edna Valley, 
Corbett Canyon, Byron, Zaca Mesa, Firestone, Sanford and Congress Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Here are recipes for the winning cioppino and for the top rated accompaniments, 
Ciambra-Ball's pesto and Wally's tomato chutney.

ABOUT WINE: PRICE REMAINS MAJOR FACTOR IN BUYER'S PERCEPTION OF WINE QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Price often determines the buyer's perception of quality, which is why St. 
Supery Vineyards and Winery is going to have a harder time making an impact in 
the marketplace than it ought to. 
</P>
<P>
The wines of this new, high-image Napa Valley property are very good, but 
they're too well-priced. People expect high pricing on good wine from 
high-image wineries. 
</P>
<P>
Perceptions of the price-quality relationship apply to many items. People feel 
that if something sells for a lot of money, it has to be excellent or else no 
one would buy it. They feel anything low-priced must be mediocre; there has to 
be a reason it's not expensive. 
</P>
<P>
With some products, you know by performance that a high price is warranted. If 
you buy a Rolex watch, you know it'll keep the right time. If you buy a 
Mercedes-Benz, you're confident it will get you to the supermarket. Reliability 
comes as a side benefit to the prestige value. 
</P>
<P>
But with some products, you take the quality on faith; performance isn't 
relevant. Wine is like that, especially with some people and some wines. Those 
who don't understand wine but feel they have to have the best buy judge wine 
purely by price. The more expensive the better. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showy Wine Choice 
</P>
<P>
Restaurateurs love these folks. They have loads of expendable capital and they 
don't mind expending it, especially if it is for a good show (i.e., a showy 
experience in which guests "oh and ah" over the choice of wine). 
</P>
<P>
Restaurateurs who charge $125 for Dom Perignon do so so their moneyed diners 
can show off. Ordering an expensive wine supposedly shows good taste and a 
sense of largess, not to mention ego. Dom Perignon is good Champagne, but is it 
worth a hundred and a quarter? Not in U.S. dollars, it's not. Yet a lot of it 
sells at $125. With most buyers, the price covers up for a lack of knowledge 
that Krug and Bollinger are better and often less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Some overpriced wine sells merely because a lot of people aren't sophisticated 
enough to taste a wine and tell its quality without looking at the price tag. 
This includes a lot of retail wine merchants and restaurant personnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price-Reflected Quality 
</P>
<P>
Thus they accept the price of a wine as indicative of quality. These are the 
people who tell you Opus One and Dominus are excellent at $45 or $50 a bottle. 
(Yet I think Trilogy, Lyeth and Cain Five are better wines -- and less 
expensive.) 
</P>
<P>
(A side note here: the 1983 Dominus was released in March with very little 
fanfare. Dominus, a joint venture between the John Daniel Society and Christian 
Moueix of Chateau Petrus, is a big, bold red wine. Frankly, I'm not very 
enamored of it. It sells for $42.50. In my view, hype sells this wine, not 
quality. For fans of Dominus, the 1985 version is due out in November.) 
</P>
<P>
Dominus sells out (it makes 4,200 cases) each year, yet many wines that are 
well-priced are hard sells. Well-priced wines require hand selling by 
knowledgeable wine merchants and sommeliers -- which is one good reason to shop 
where there are savvy people working, folks who can direct you to the great 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even the wine writer has a chore convincing folks that a $5 bottle of wine 
is worth more. People say, "Hey, if this stuff is so good, how come it doesn't 
cost more?" 
</P>
<P>
And the answer can be any of a number of things: A lot of it was made and a 
higher price would slow down its sale; the winery didn't know how good the 
stuff would get in the bottle (it is, after all, a living product); retailers 
improperly balked at an initially higher price so it was lowered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inexpensive Value 
</P>
<P>
At a recent tasting of Merlots, the winners were all priced $14 to $16 a 
bottle, but two of the better ones were inexpensive. Yet selling them isn't 
easy because they are priced too cheap to indicate how good they are. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best Merlot values around these days is 1988 Vina del Mar from Chile 
($6). The wine has a lovely green-tea aroma embedded in dense cherrylike fruit. 
You might find the wine a bit simple and soft, but there is ample structure. 
Considering the price, it's amazing this wine could be made this well and cost 
this little. 
</P>
<P>
Another sleeper is 1987 La Playa from the Maipo Valley in Chile ($5). A 
violet-and-tea complexity in the aroma leads to a new oak-and-mint finish, 
quite surprising for a wine of so modest a price. It's a wine for immediate 
consumption but well worth the price, and a wine that would sell at $10 to $12 
if it said Napa Valley on the label. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat From Chile 
</P>
<P>
Chile, indeed, represents a growing threat to California's higher-priced wines 
since we are now seeing a wave of imports from Chile that represent excellent 
value. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best is 1982 Cousino-Macul Antiguas Riservas, a Cabernet Sauvignon 
of gorgeous, regal quality. This wine was made from grapes grown on 50-year-old 
vines on the stony slope above the Maipo Valley, then aged in oak for about 
three years. The wine's fruit and suppleness are exciting, and the aftertaste 
is akin to a fine Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
Now 7 1/2 years old, this wine sells for $9.50. It tastes as if it could sell 
for twice that; and for people who like a wine with finesse and breed, it's an 
excellent buy. But I suspect some people may see the low price and decide that 
a $14 bottle would be safer. 
</P>
<P>
People like to age their red wine; here's a red that comes already aged, and 
yet the price is fair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for a Foothold 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, none of the Chilean wines is competition for Chateau Petrus, but as 
Chilean wines attempt to gain a foothold in the U.S. market, wines like this 
are going to be undervalued. And that, ironically, makes them a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
Back to St. Supery. 
</P>
<P>
It is the venture of a Skalli S.A., a major food company in France. In 1982, 
the Skalli family bought a 1,500-acre ranch in Pope Valley, an eastern spur of 
the Napa Valley that doesn't have the name-recognition of Napa property. Four 
years later, Skalli acquired a smaller parcel of land right on California 29 in 
the heart of the Napa Valley, not far from stalwarts Inglenook and Beaulieu. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, the final touches have been put on a new winery and guest 
house, and the Skallis have spent an estimated $18 million thus far. You'd 
think that that kind of financial commitment would result in expensive first 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laid-Back Strategy 
</P>
<P>
But St. Supery is going slowly, for three reasons: St. Supery's vines are 
young, so the first wines will be lighter than future releases; the new kid on 
the block can't expect to get a ton of money for its wines just because it 
spent a lot making them, and the winery's chief executive officer knows what 
the market is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of competition out there, and we want to show that our wines 
represent good value," said Michaela Rodeno, formerly head of public relations 
for Domaine Chandon and now the driving force behind St. Supery. 
</P>
<P>
The first releases from St. Supery, made by wine maker Bob Broman (formerly of 
Stag's Leap), are lovely and elegant and priced well. The 1988 Sauvignon Blanc 
($7.50) has a light melon and mild chile aroma. It is delicate and goes well 
with food. The 1988 Chardonnay ($11) is lightly creamy with a pear aroma and is 
likewise delicate but should develop with another year in the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Cabernet to Come 
</P>
<P>
To be released in January is an excellent, beautifully balanced 1987 Cabernet 
at $12 that could easily fetch more. 
</P>
<P>
St. Supery might have been persuaded to charge more, but Rodeno noted that for 
a first release she wanted to keep the price reasonable to show the public what 
the winery could do. 
</P>
<P>
I feel the pricing strategy is appropriate for this reason: California wineries 
rarely, if ever, lower their prices from the previous year. Thus prices set for 
new wines, and increases for established wines, must be considered extremely 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
I also feel that the coming surplus of wine in the market, and the resulting 
weakening of prices, will help St. Supery overcome the natural inclination of 
people to feel there must be something wrong with products that are reasonably 
priced. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 St. Francis Chardonnay "California" ($9.50) -- An 
attractive pineapple and lemon aroma and a hint of pine give this wine a quite 
complex scent for so reasonable a price. The taste is relatively broad and 
rich, but excellent balancing acid and more of the lemony-ness sniffed earlier 
make it crisp. Many second-label California-designated Chardonnays are hitting 
store shelves at less than $10 these days; this is one of the better ones.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: A LIGHTER SIDE TO SEASONAL FARE FOR TAILGATE PICNICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortened daylight hours and the return of cooler evenings might seem like two 
good reasons to give up summer out-of-doors activities. But for some, the 
beloved picnic is an outing too relaxing to abandon. That's how fall tailgate 
parties came into favor. 
</P>
<P>
The activity has typically accompanied a seasonal sporting event such as 
football or an early evening at the races. But whether the trek leads to a 
favorite scenic spot or the stadium parking lot, now is the time for a tailgate 
picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Although standard picnic fare such as cold fried chicken and mayonnaise-laden 
salads can be fairly high in fat and calories, it is possible to picnic and 
have all the fun and good taste of a celebration even when reducing the fat 
content of your menu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Healthful Options 
</P>
<P>
These tips, from the Human Nutrition Information Service, an agency of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, will help picnic-packers assemble more healthful 
baskets -- ones that are in line with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines and emphasize 
foods that are low in sodium, sugars, fat and calories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grill chicken, hamburgers and lean steaks so the fat runs off during 
cooking. Remove the skin from poultry, particularly if the fried variety will 
be served, and trim visible fat from steaks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use salt, butter and margarine sparingly, if at all, on corn-on-the-cob. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Load up on mixed green salad or vegetable relishes, featuring cherry 
tomatoes, radishes, cucumbers, carrots, celery, green peppers, broccoli and 
cauliflower. Have smaller helpings of coleslaw, potato and macaroni salad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Liven up the flavor of burgers with lettuce, tomatoes, onions or other 
vegetables instead of barbecue sauce, catsup, mustard, relish and pickles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Enjoy bananas, grapes, pears, apples, figs and other fall season fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pack small cans or cartons of fruit juice or unsweetened ice tea rather 
than soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take along small boxes or bags of raisins or dried fruit mix, or prepare a 
snack mix with plain popcorn, unsweetened cereals, bite-size pretzels and 
seasonings such as paprika, hot pepper sauce and onion or garlic powder. These 
items can replace cakes, cookies, potato chips and other snacks. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes for homemade breads, soups, and sandwiches will give the 
excursion a healthful and tasty flair. 
</P>
<P>
CHEESE-STUFFED CHICKEN GRILL 
</P>
<P>
10 ounces low-fat Jack cheese

WINE NOTES: FEWER WINE ADS FOR 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Media advertising for wine in 1988 dropped 24% from 1987, and advertising for 
wine coolers dropped 34% in the same period, according to the 1989 Jobson's 
Wine Marketing Handbook, published annually by Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group. 
</P>
<P>
The handbook showed that only sparkling wine advertising rose in 1988, and the 
only medium to show an increase was spot radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Retrenchment was the industry's strategy in 1988," said Seymour Leikind, 
publisher of the handbook. He said the wine industry is in transition, with 
many of the leading brands "trying to shore up eroding bases." 
</P>
<P>
Gallo, the leading advertiser of wine in the United States, spent $13 million 
less in 1988 than in the previous year, with total ad expenditures dropping to 
$51 million, Jobson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooler Ads Down 
</P>
<P>
The handbook showed that wine cooler ad outlays went from $123 million in 1987 
to $81 million in 1988, and 85% of that total came from the industry's Big 3 -- 
Gallo's Bartles &amp; Jaymes, Seagram's, and Miller Brewing Co.'s Matilda Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in sparkling wine advertising in 1988 was spearheaded by Gallo's 
new Tott's and by a campaign for Martini &amp; Rossi Asti Spumante, the 
handbook reported. 
</P>
<P>
Jobson is the publisher of Beverage Dynamics, a magazine that reports on the 
national alcoholic beverage business, and in the latest issue of that 
publication Jobson predicts a 10.9% growth this year in non-alcoholic beer 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
The publication notes that Anheuser-Busch is test-marketing a non-alcoholic 
beer called O'Doul's and that another non-alcoholic beer called Buckler is 
being marketed by Van Munching in eight major cities. 
</P>
<P>
The publication said 6.7 million cases of non-alcoholic beer were sold in the 
United States in 1988. The category leader is Kingsbury. 
</P>
<P>
Arbor Crest Winery in Spokane, Wash., announced it would import three wines 
produced in the Soviet Union. They are to be priced at about $7 a bottle.

COOK IT LIGHT: HAMBURGER PIE GOES HEALTHFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR JEANNE: This dish is one of our family favorites, and I would appreciate 
it if you could revise it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NEVA, Citrus Heights, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
HAMBURGER PIE 
</P>
<P>
1 pound ground beef 
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 (16-ounce) can cut green beans, drained 
</P>
<P>
1 (10 3/4-ounce) can tomato soup 
</P>
<P>
5 medium potatoes, cooked 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup warm milk 
</P>
<P>
1 egg, beaten 
</P>
<P>
Shredded Cheddar cheese, optional 
</P>
<P>
Lightly brown meat in skillet. Add onion and cook until tender. Add 3/4 
teaspoon salt, dash pepper, beans and soup. Pour mixture into greased 1 
1/2-quart casserole. 
</P>
<P>
Mash hot potatoes, adding milk and egg. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Drop in mounds over meat. Sprinkle cheese over top. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 350 degrees 25 to 30 minutes. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR NEVA: There are several things you can do immediately to make this hearty 
meat pie a heart-healthy pie. Use the leanest meat you can buy and, if 
necessary, have the market grind it for you after removing all the visible fat. 
After browning the meat, drain it thoroughly before proceeding with the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
You didn't specify the kind of milk you use, so I based my nutritional analysis 
on low-fat milk for your recipe but used nonfat milk for my revision. 
Eliminating the egg yolk further reduces the cholesterol and fat in my version. 
</P>
<P>
If you do sprinkle cheese on this pie, be sure it is a fat-reduced Cheddar. Few 
people can tell the difference between regular cheese and a 20%-fat-reduced 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to further reduce the bottom-line figures, I think this pie could 
easily serve six instead of four. 
</P>

There is this surge of hot water that's forced through a fine grind of dark 
roast coffee; it is so strong that it presses out all the rich aroma and flavor 
from the coffee. Pump driven, out comes espresso -- an intense black brew 
underneath a floating strata of golden crema, a creamy tan-colored foam that 
results when roasted coffee oils are aerated in this heating process. 
</P>
<P>
The brewing cycle is quick. The extraction, severe but pleasant. This is what 
pump espresso-making is all about. Push a button and there it goes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Over-Boiling or Steaming 
</P>
<P>
Although reaching an ideal high temperature, the water from the pump mechanism 
doesn't over-boil or steam up to ruin the original taste of the coffee, turning 
it into a bitter drink. That's the difference between a pump espresso machine 
and an old-fashioned steam version. 
</P>
<P>
The modern pump machines come with an extra bonus favored by Americans and 
borrowed from the Capuchin monks: cappuccino. If you have always thought that 
this beverage is espresso topped with whipped cream, don't worry, you're not 
alone. In a national "espresso I.Q." survey conducted recently by Krups, about 
half of the people defined cappuccino as such. All it is is espresso with 
steamed milk and froth. 
</P>
<P>
So who's making rich espresso possible for the home these days? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leader in Technology 
</P>
<P>
There's Gaggia. They're way ahead with the technology since Achille Gaggia 
patented in 1949 the initial technology that we know as the pump system today. 
From then on, the Italian company has marketed several models. Still pumping 
strong in the American market are the high end electronic Baby Gaggia ($500) 
and the Coffee Gaggia Espresso/Cappuccino ($400). 
</P>
<P>
Introduced about five years ago, the latter is a sturdy unit with a 50-cup 
capacity and continuous espresso operation. Available in white with black trim, 
its 100-watt pump power produces excellent crema in espresso while its steam 
output (less than 1500 water boiler power) lasts about 30 minutes. The milk 
froth is beautifully thick. 
</P>
<P>
The big news from Gaggia is the forthcoming Gran Gaggia Pump 
Espresso/Cappuccino Machine. At a low price of $149 for the machine, the 
company claims it has the quality and performance of a pump machine but the 
economy of a steam machine. The 750-watt machine will be equipped with two 
thermostats, one for coffee and one for steam, a 20-cup refillable water tank 
and a turbo "frother." 
</P>
<P>
Espresso machines don't all come from Italy, the land of espresso. There are 
three easy to operate units that are made in Switzerland with very similar 
features and accessories: Krups, Rotel Prestige and St. Gallen. 
</P>
<P>
The most exciting feature from Krups L'Espresso Plus thermal block machine 
($375, currently introduced at $299) is the option to use Illycaffe espresso 
pods ($9.95 for 18 espresso pods), which up until now have only been available 
to restaurateurs. Although the machine makes excellent espresso with the 
regular blends, the use of the pods can easily spoil you. 
</P>
<P>
They not only taste good, (try the decaffeinated in particular) but these 
famous pods take the guesswork out of measuring and tamping espresso grounds, 
avoiding all the messy spills in preparation. Premeasured espresso grounds a 
from high quality Arabica blend are packed in neat filter packs and all you do 
is insert them onto the filter basket. 
</P>
<P>
Another plus for the new all-black Krups (which looks the same as the Krups 
Novo) machine is the thicker foam it produces with its steamer. Blame it on a 
tiny periscope, a patented detachable cappuccino device that sucks air in as 
steam is going through the milk to help create greater froth. 
</P>
<P>
The next two machines make wonderful espresso but not as thick a milk foam for 
cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
It takes 35 seconds to raise the temperature of fresh cold water to just below 
boiling with the electronic Rotel Prestige ($299) Espressomat. This is a 
thermal block machine with a lift-out 54-ounce (for 25 cups) water reservoir. 
And for a continuous brewing operation, the reheat cycle lasts 15 seconds. 
Also, for those who prefer tea or other hot beverages, the steam outlet 
converts to a hot water jet. Sleek looking in white, the Rotel offers hidden 
compartments to store accessories and the electric cord. The top of the machine 
also serves as a cup warmer. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Gallen Espresso Machine ($250) is designed to serve two to four 
two-ounce cups directly into a carafe or espresso cups, and comes with both a 
two and four-cup espresso basket. Like the Rotel Prestige, it has a convenient 
warming tray in the top of the unit. One of its prime features is the gauge 
that indicates when the proper brewing pressure has been reached. It also tells 
if the pressure in the system is either too little or too much due to improper 
grind or improper packing of the brewing basket. The unit is available in matte 
black or white with matte black accents. 
</P>
<P>
Following are some tips to help you make a good cup of espresso and cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
Use top quality fresh Arabica roast for best-tasting espresso with nice crema. 
(Robusta beans produce coffee with higher caffeine content than Arabica.) 
Overly roasted beans result in bitterness. To preserve rich flavors, store 
beans in an airtight container up to four weeks only; do not refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
Whole coffee beans are recommended for extra freshness. They should be ground 
just before use. A burr-type grinder is preferred over a blade type for 
uniformity of the grind. 
</P>
<P>
The beans should be finely ground but not powdery like flour. They should feel 
gritty, like salt. Avoid getting too coarse a grind, or water will flow too 
fast and you will lose coffee body. On the other hand, if the water flows too 
slowly or not at all, the grind was too fine or packed too firmly in the filter 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
Although similar in operation, every machine is different so manual 
instructions should be followed carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid getting a cold espresso by preheating the machine as well as the cups. 
When preparing cappuccino, start steaming milk before making espresso so that 
espresso is hot and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Start with very cold milk; warm milk will not froth as well. For a dense foam, 
use skim milk. Whole milk, although richer tasting, produces a lighter, less 
stable, foam. 
</P>
<P>
To get a good froth, take the pitcher of milk (do not fill more than half-full) 
and insert under the steam nozzle, directing the nozzle almost to the bottom of 
the pitcher. After about 10 seconds, move the pitcher up and down to continue 
heating, ending just below the surface of the milk until enough froth is 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended proportion for a serving of cappuccino is one-third espresso 
and two-thirds hot milk and froth. For pure espresso, 1 1/2 to two ounces; 
pumping longer causes mild and diluted espresso. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coffee Gaggia is available at the Coffee Junction (Tarzana), the Brewery 
(Santa Monica) and Cook's Corner (Glendale). The Gran Gaggia will be available 
at a later date at Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 Krups L'Espresso is available at Bullock's, Robinson's, Broadway and 
Williams-Sonoma. For information on availability of the St. Gellan machine, 
call (914)-241-6700 or write to P.O. Box 118, Mt. Kisco, N.Y. 10549-0118. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rotel Espressomat is available at the Brewery (Santa Monica), Coffee, Etc. 
(Sherman Oaks) and Coffee Importers (Dana Point).

SURVEY FINDS THE SIX KINDS OF SUPERMARKET SHOPPERS -- WHICH ARE YOU?; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHANGING NATURE OF FOOD PURCHASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE E. MAYER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heidi Young unloads her grocery cart, full of Stouffer's frozen dinners, onto 
the conveyor belt and sighs. "I work a long week, and I don't like to spend a 
lot of time shopping," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Or cooking, for that matter. "When I get home, I don't have the energy and 
inclination." So it's either frozen dinners or fresh entrees prepared in the 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Three checkout counters down from Young at an Alexandria, Va., Safeway is 
Charlotte Hall, who after 52 years of marriage admits she is tired of cooking. 
With her four children all gone from home, Hall and her husband "just don't eat 
a lot like we used to. We have a lot of frozen dinners or eat out." 
</P>
<P>
In the express lane, however, is John Kicak, a retired engineer and an avid 
shopper. Kicak stops in his local supermarkets for fresh vegetables and 
last-minute items, but for the everyday products, he goes to the store that has 
the best prices -- usually the warehouse supermarket down the street or a 
discount warehouse club miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I pay 99 cents for a roll of paper towels (at a traditional 
supermarket) when I can get them (at a warehouse club) for 76 cents?" Kicak 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Traditional Customer 
</P>
<P>
For years, Kicak has been the supermarket's traditional customer -- a 
bargain-seeker who likes to cook. But today, with two-wage-earner families and 
chockablock schedules, Kicak is one of a declining breed of shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers like Hall and Young, on the other hand, belong to a burgeoning group 
of Americans who are looking for shortcuts in both cooking and shopping -- and 
are willing to pay more for these conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets, seeing these consumers spending an increasing amount of money at 
convenience stores, takeout-food counters and restaurants, are introducing new 
services, from full-service banks to travel agencies and dry cleaning, to keep 
these reluctant shoppers coming to their stores. In the years ahead, even 
baby-sitting, home repair and poodle washes are possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The supermarket will become home to a surprising number of new departments," 
says Willard Bishop, president of the supermarket-consulting firm Willard 
Bishop Consulting Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the innovations is the evolving consumer as delineated in a recent 
survey by the consulting firm Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. for the Coca-Cola 
Retailing Research Council, which studies major issues and problems confronted 
by wholesalers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Distinct Groups 
</P>
<P>
The study found six distinct groups of supermarket shoppers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avid Shoppers: Active cooks and shoppers, avid shoppers are usually bargain 
seekers like Kicak. "They cook dinner nearly every day, eating out only on 
special occasions," the study says. So it's no surprise that they spend more 
time shopping than other consumers and are not loyal to any particular store, 
preferring instead to shop at the store that offers the best prices that 
particular day. 
</P>
<P>
Avid shoppers have traditionally been the supermarket's core customers, 
accounting today for 26% of all consumers, or almost one of every four 
shoppers. But by the year 2000 the number of avid shoppers is expected to drop 
to one of every five shoppers, or 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hurried Shoppers: Mostly working mothers, hurried shoppers are busy 
consumers who are looking for shortcuts in shopping and cooking. "These mothers 
consider a healthful family dinner desirable but dislike cooking and lack the 
time during the day to prepare meals regularly," the study finds. 
</P>
<P>
However, eating out is difficult with children, so these shoppers are willing 
to spend more money than the avid shopper, buying a lot of takeout, frozen or 
prepared food. This is important, because the group will spend a 
disproportionately large amount of money on food even while dropping from 17% 
of today's consumers to 15% in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unfettered Shoppers: Mostly older consumers, unfettered shoppers' children 
have grown up and left home. "Dinner is less complicated now," the study says. 
Simpler meals are made when they eat at home, but frequently these consumers 
eat out or take out. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, these shoppers are increasingly conscious about what they eat, monitoring 
their cholesterol and salt intake. With the aging population, this group of 
shoppers is growing the fastest. Accounting for 13% of the shoppers today, this 
group is expected to reach 16% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kitchen Strangers: Whether married, single or divorced, kitchen strangers 
are those shoppers in households without children. "The kitchen stranger rarely 
cooks dinner, eating out for breakfast, lunch or dinner -- sometimes all 
three," the study finds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Low-Priority Chore 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, cooking is a major inconvenience, and shopping is a 
low-priority chore. These shoppers now total 20% of U.S. households and are 
expected to grow to 22% by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kitchen Birds: Generally very old consumers, kitchen birds include many 
widowed women and people living alone. These consumers shop and cook very 
little and tend to eat lightly. Now accounting for 6% of U.S. households, this 
group is expected to grow marginally -- to 7% -- by the end of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Constrained Shoppers: Lacking in money and transportation, constrained 
shoppers are limited in their selection of groceries and supermarkets. "They 
typically walk to and from the supermarket, and they buy very little non-food 
merchandise there," according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
Given their tight budgets and spending power far below their absolute numbers, 
these shoppers probably will continue to be overlooked by most supermarkets. 
Generally located in urban areas, they make up about 18% of all U.S. households 
and are expected to total about 20% by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
With reluctant shoppers (the hurried and unfettered, kitchen strangers and 
birds) rising in number and spending power, supermarkets realize that 
convenience is critical. So it's no wonder that many chains are trying to turn 
their stores into the ultimate one-stop shopping center, seeking to provide 
more than just food, drugs, videotapes, photo processing and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
In many stores around the country, full-service banks are being set up where 
shoppers not only can deposit money and cash checks, but also can buy 
certificates of deposits, obtain small loans and, in some cases, store 
valuables in safe deposit boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond banks, stores are setting up special service centers to take care of 
other daily business. Jewel-Osco of Florida, for example, has set up a center 
where shoppers can send express mail and use telephone facsimile machines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken to the Cleaners 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Midwestern Hy-Vee Food Stores Inc. has in-store shoe-repair 
shops and also takes in laundry -- which is then sent to a local cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
"It is big business and growing," says Ron Pearson, Hy-Vee President. 
Additionally, about a dozen of its 150 supermarkets will house small travel 
agencies by the end of the year. "We're also looking at insurance," Pearson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets also are exploring ways to get shoppers in and out more easily. 
Kroger Co., for example, has set up separate cash registers at both its salad 
bars and deli stands so takeout customers need stand in only one line at the 
store and not join the so-called express lines. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Vons Grocery Co. has gone further, setting up a convenience 
store -- with its own check-out system -- inside a regular grocery store. The 
Vons Express Store stocks the same items found in 7-Eleven-type stores but 
sells them at the regular supermarket price, which is typically about 20% below 
convenience-store prices. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to convenience, supermarkets also are paying greater attention to 
nutrition. One Washington state chain, Mega Food, for example, is creating a 
nutrition club, called Future Perfect, whose centerpiece is prepared meals low 
in cholesterol and salt. 
</P>
<P>
To enter the 18-month program that will begin this fall, consumers pay a $300 
initiation fee for a complete body work-up that includes an analysis of body 
fat and metabolic rate. Then a dietary program is designed for each individual, 
outlining daily food requirements and weekly exercise programs. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the dietary goals, consumers can buy prepared meals that were designed 
by a dietitian at the store -- either daily or twice a week. The meals, also 
available to non-club members, include chicken piccata with fettuccine and 
broccoli, barbecue kebabs with rice and beef, tomato and basil salad with a 
whole-wheat roll. Prices for lunch range from $2.50 to $2.90; dinner, from $5 
to $6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stores Scrambling 
</P>
<P>
Many other nontraditional supermarket programs are likely to be introduced in 
the years ahead as stores scramble to keep as customers the time-pressed, 
unenthusiastic cooks. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Booz-Allen study predicts that stores may set up a specialty 
pet shop with "all-natural pet food, gourmet pet food, frozen, imported pet 
food in a freezer case. Not just leashes and flea collars, but puppy sweaters, 
scratching posts, goldfish tanks. The widest collection of puppy toys. A 
knowledgeable nutritionist on Monday afternoons." 
</P>
<P>
The shop is a natural, Booz-Allen vice presidents Susan Engel and Barbara Cohen 
conclude, because three out of four families with children and two out of three 
working women have pets -- in other words, some of the very reluctant shoppers 
supermarkets want to keep attracting. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson, who is studying the pet-shop concept, believes even more unusual 
services are in the offing, such as window washing, plumbing and maid service. 
</P>
<P>
"Survey after survey shows that supermarkets are some of the most trusted 
people in the community," says Pearson. "Therefore, if you are a good 
businessman in the community and have built up trust, you should be able to 
provide other services, like home repair and window washing. Just book through 
me and I will guarantee an honest, competent person. I see that coming." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen also predicts that baby-sitting may come in the not-too-distant future. 
Given the labor shortage, supermarkets may be forced to offer day care just to 
find and keep employees. "Once they provide it for employees, it's only a 
logical extension to offer it to customers as well." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is baby-sitting, home repair or nutrition clubs, it is certain that 
the landscape of each and every supermarket will be changing dramatically in 
the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
As Pearson says, "it's a revolving business, and the formats are constantly 
changing. Maybe not every one of these ideas will be on target, but some 
certainly will be."

MICROWAVE . . .: HERE'S MOUSSE THAT'S SIMPLY GREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you really want to wow friends with your microwave prowess, try this 
drop-dead chocolate mousse. 
</P>
<P>
It looks -- and tastes -- as if you'd slaved over a hot stove all day. And yet 
it needs only minutes in the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
But first, a few pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never double this recipe as it may curdle or boil over. Whenever you need a 
double amount, prepare two batches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never try to hurry cooking of egg-thickened desserts by upping the power 
level to HIGH (100% power). In ovens of 700 watts or more, egg mixtures may 
cook more evenly on 10% to 20% power. Whenever the mixture seems in danger of 
curdling, reduce the power level at once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always watch egg mixtures carefully as they microwave and check for 
doneness after minimum cooking time (microwave times will vary according to the 
oven's power). When it comes to delicate egg-thickened mixtures, seconds, not 
minutes, can spell the difference between success and failure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remember that egg-thickened mixtures continue to cook as they stand, so 
remove from the microwave the instant they test done. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To stop cooking of egg mixtures cold, quick-chill in an ice bath or whisk 
briskly for several seconds. 
</P>
<P>
CHOCOLATE MOUSSE 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
3 eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate curls and/or toasted blanched almonds, optional 
</P>
<P>
Melt chocolate with water in uncovered 1-quart bowl by microwaving on MEDIUM 
(50% power) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Beat until smooth. Whisk small amount of 
chocolate into egg yolks, mix back into bowl and microwave, uncovered, on 
MEDIUM-LOW (30% power) 1 to 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Whisk again and transfer to cold 2-quart bowl. Stir in vanilla and cool to 
lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
Beat cream with powdered sugar until soft mounds form. Fold into chocolate 
mixture. 
</P>
<P>
In separate bowl, beat egg whites to soft peaks and fold in, small amount at 
time, until no white streaks show. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon into serving dish, cover and chill 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Decorate 
with chocolate curls and/or toasted blanched almonds. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: For Frozen Chocolate Mousse, prepare mousse as directed and chill. 
Spoon into parfait glasses. Cover and freeze until firm. Let stand 10 to 15 
minutes at room temperature before serving. 
</P>
<P>
How to Make Chocolate Curls: Unwrap 1-ounce square chocolate (any type). Place 
on plate and microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM (50% power) 15 to 20 seconds until 
just warm. Using swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, shave off curls. If chocolate 
hardens, simply rewarm. 
</P>
<P>
How to Toast Almonds: Spread 1/2 to 2 cups blanched, slivered almonds on 9- to 
11-inch pie plate, depending on amount. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% 
power), allowing 3 to 4 minutes for 1/2 cup and 4 to 6 minutes for 1 to 2 cups, 
stirring once or twice, until lightly browned. Let stand, uncovered, 2 to 3 
minutes. Nuts will continue browning as they stand, so don't overcook. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

1ST SOLAR PHONE BOX FOR HIGHWAY HELP TO BE INSTALLED FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of 329 solar-powered call boxes designed to help stranded motorists 
will be installed in Ventura County on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
County officials expect to have the entire system in place by January, with 
yellow boxes set at half-mile intervals on both sides of sections of highways 
1, 101, 126, 118, 23 and 33. 
</P>
<P>
The boxes will be placed to ensure that motorists in the most heavily traveled 
stretches of state road are never farther than one-quarter mile away from 
direct communication with the California Highway Patrol, officials said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Each call box will be placed in the middle of a 12-foot-high pole, on top of 
which will perch a black, shingle-like solar panel and an antenna that 
transmits telephone radio signals. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will collect solar energy and store it in a battery. Costs to dig 
trenches around the highway system and lay traditional telephone cables would 
be exorbitant, said Lynne Roberts, program manager for call-box operators for 
the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists using the phones will not have to dial. One push of a button will 
show CHP dispatchers where the call is coming from. Callers then will talk to 
the dispatchers and ask for assistance from patrolmen, ambulances, tow trucks 
and other emergency help. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, drivers will be able to alert authorities when they see drunken 
drivers, highway accidents or toxic spills. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the calls received in other counties that have such systems are 
reports of disabled vehicles, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Help will be at their fingertips, literally," said Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria). "It is one of the most significant accomplishments in my 
legislative career." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell authored legislation in 1985 that provided $1 million for 
installation of the system. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation guaranteed that Ventura County would receive more funds than 
other counties from an agreement requiring the federal government to give a 
share of proceeds from offshore oil drilling leases to the state of California. 
O'Connell argued that Ventura County deserves the extra funds because it bears 
the brunt of ill effects from offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, drivers in Ventura County will have to help finance the system by 
paying an extra dollar to register their cars each year. 
</P>
<P>
The fee will be in place until officials have a chance to work with the system 
and find out how much it costs, said Al Knuth, county deputy director of public 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Upkeep costs may be higher than originally expected, Knuth said. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents in Orange County, which has a similar system, knock down call boxes 
at the rate of two per month, Knuth said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County is one of the few counties in the state to obtain call boxes. 
Los Angeles has had a call box system since 1963. Orange County's solar call 
box system has been in place a little more than a year, and San Diego completed 
installation of call boxes last year. 
</P>
<P>
The system will cover all of Highway 101 from the Santa Barbara County line to 
the Los Angeles County line, said Bob Randall, project engineer for the county. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Highway 1, the system will begin at Five Points in Oxnard and end 
near Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
On Highway 118, call boxes will begin at the Los Angeles County line and end 
near Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
On Highway 126, the system will begin at the intersection of Highway 101 and 
end just east of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
On Highway 23, it will run from the intersection of Highway 101 to just east of 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
On Highway 33, it will extend from the intersection of Highway 101 to a point 
just south of Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking ceremony for the first box is scheduled for Friday at 10 
a.m. at the La Conchita exit off U.S. 101 north of Ventura.

ASPECTS OF RECYCLING LEGISLATION ARE UNDER STUDY IN LONG BEACH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach officials are trying to determine whether the city would be exempt 
from proposed legislation requiring California cities to meet stringent 
recycling goals because it operates a waste-to-energy plant. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is designed to rid California of half the garbage it dumps in 
landfills. The bill, by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), won final 
approval last Friday and was sent to Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
As the Sher bill was debated, several lawmakers questioned whether Long Beach 
could wiggle around a provision to encourage cities by the year 2000 to reduce 
rubbish by 50% through recycling, composting and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that Long Beach is exempt from doing any recycling," asserted Sen. 
Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Sher, however, said the proposal merely allows cities that operate high-tech 
waste-to-energy plants, such as Long Beach, to seek recycling waivers from a 
new state waste board. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Long Beach, supporters of the bill said, the proposal could apply to 
the cities of Commerce and Modesto in the San Joaquin Valley where similar 
facilities burn trash to generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Sher said it would not be easy to win a waiver or a revision in the recycling 
goals, citing at least two hurdles cities must overcome. 
</P>
<P>
He said that as of Jan. 1, 1989, incinerators must have been burning at least 
75% of a city's refuse, and the city must have had firm contracts to deliver 
electricity generated at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
While Commerce and Modesto might be effected, the focus of the legislative 
debate on the bill was on Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
John Shirey, Long Beach assistant city manager, said he is uncertain whether 
the city is exempted from the bill's recycling goals. As soon as he sees the 
135-page bill, he said, "we'll try to analyze it" and determine how to proceed. 
Shirey said the city was not involved in the negotiations on the Sher bill. 
</P>
<P>
But Shirey confirmed that at least 75% of the city's refuse is burned at its 
plant on Terminal Island and that the city had electrical contracts with 
Southern California Edison Co. on Jan. 1 -- the two prerequisites for seeking a 
waiver. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Southeast Resource Recovery Facility burns about 1,200 tons of trash 
a day. The city also is about to form an advisory committee to develop a plan 
for recycling, said Bill Davis, the city's solid waste bureau manager. If Long 
Beach is required to meet Sher's recycling goals, Davis said, the city could 
obtain garbage for its incinerator from nearby communities. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Selna, project manager for the Commerce trash-to-energy plant, said the 
impact of the bill is unclear. He said the facility burns about 350 tons of 
trash daily. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, incinerators were seen as a promising alternative to 
landfills. But opponents, who questioned the impact of the facilities on air 
quality, managed to get plans for most of the plants shelved. Stephen R. 
Maguin, head of solid waste management for the county Sanitation Districts, 
said that in the short term, waste-to-energy plans are not acceptable in the 
Los Angeles area. Under the bill, after a five-year moratorium and if recycling 
and other measures fail, up to 5% of the state's garbage could be burned in 
incinerators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incineration Debate 
</P>
<P>
Although the incineration issue was hotly debated, the question of whether some 
cities could be exempted failed to surface until Friday -- hours before the 
Legislature adjourned for the year. 
</P>
<P>
One legislative source close to the negotiations said the waiver provision was 
not put into the bill to bail out any specific city. 
</P>
<P>
Another legislative staffer, who also asked not to be identified, suggested 
that the waiver language was inserted into the bill to protect the incinerator 
in the Modesto area. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Fredenburg, an aide to Sen. Torres, said his reading of the bill is that 
"generally it's an exemption for cities with incinerators," including Long 
Beach and Modesto but probably not Commerce -- which Torres represents. 
Commerce may not incinerate 75% of its own garbage, as required by the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Saturday, Deukmejian said he had nothing to do with 
any potentially favorable treatment for Long Beach, which he represented in the 
Legislature for many years. But he joked that it sounded like "a pretty good 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen anything else the whole session that was directly beneficial to 
Long Beach. I'm glad to hear something came through."

SANCTUARY STANDOFF; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORS, ACTIVISTS CLASH OVER PROGRAM FOR THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The crowd begins gathering in the Long Beach church courtyard an hour before 
the meal begins. Wearing torn jeans and wrapped in dirty blankets, the people 
lounge on concrete benches, chatting idly among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Later they enter the sanctuary for a sermon by an evangelical Christian 
minister. Then they file into the church basement to partake of the ritual for 
which most have come: a hot meal of rice, beans and salad scooped from huge 
vats and eaten at long tables. 
</P>
<P>
"The food's not exactly extravagant, but it keeps us from being hungry," said 
Paula Shaw, 35, who like most of the other diners is homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Christian Outreach Appeal. Here at the corner of 3rd Street and 
Linden Avenue, 1,500 hot meals are served to indigents each week and about 700 
boxes of food are given away. City officials, attending a recent ribbon-cutting 
ceremony marking an expansion of the program, praised it as an important link 
in the city's battle against homelessness. "I think it's great," Mayor Ernie 
Kell said in an interview. "Really outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents, however, are less enthusiastic. The program, they say, has 
virtually ruined their neighborhood by attracting vagrants who continuously 
block the sidewalks, wake them with loud noises early in the morning, panhandle 
in front of their houses, sleep on their properties, urinate in their bushes 
and defecate in the alleys. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel invaded," said Betsy Peele, who lives down the street. "I have no 
privacy anymore and it really hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bruce Johnson, who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years: "The mess 
around here is constant. This is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
The result is a standoff between neighbors who want the homeless center to 
leave and program administrators who say they would like to be doing even more 
for the homeless. At the heart of the controversy are the homeless people 
themselves, who gather by the hundreds each day to eat and to pray in the 
once-quiet sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
There were not always so many of them. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago when the 63-year-old building was Christ Lutheran Church, nearby 
residents say, problems were minimal in the working-class neighborhood that has 
a high percentage of apartment buildings and single-family rental units 
inhabited by families and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1984 came Christian Outreach Appeal, an independent nondenominational 
service organization begun on a shoestring a few years earlier to send donated 
food and clothing to indigents in Mexico. Today the nonprofit organization runs 
a variety of services out of the three-story church, including a job-referral 
program, regular worship services and daily canned and dry food giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residence Opened 
</P>
<P>
The recent ribbon cutting marked the opening of a new "transitional house" for 
indigents who are newly employed. The two-bedroom house, formerly the church 
parsonage, accommodates up to eight men for as long as 60 days while they 
search for permanent housing. Toilet, shower and laundry facilities have been 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Run on an annual budget of about $690,000, the center uses private and 
corporate donations, as well as contributions from area churches and a $14,200 
grant from the city. 
</P>
<P>
But the more successful it has become in attracting the homeless to its doors, 
volunteers say, the more complaints it has received from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"People get drunk and they get rowdy. It takes very little provocation to start 
a hassle," said Arnold Thomas, who preaches twice weekly at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at daily religious services is not required in exchange for food, 
according to Christian Outreach Appeal officials, but Thomas said: "We just 
compel them to come in. We make it almost mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
And although his sermons generally center on the traditional Christian message 
of salvation and redemption, the preacher said, he also stresses discipline and 
self-control to help improve his listeners' behavior in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mary Jensen, a spokeswoman for the Long Beach Police Department, 
that behavior has not resulted in an inordinate number of complaints to the 
department. Yet during a routine stop one recent afternoon, a patrolman on the 
beat asked a group of homeless people congregating in front of the Christian 
Outreach Appeal building to disperse lest they offend the sensibilities of a 
passing resident out walking her dog. "You have a right to be here, but these 
people want you out," he said, indicating the neighbors with a wide sweep of 
his hand. 
</P>
<P>
While virtually everyone in the neighborhood has heard rumors of a petition 
being circulated to oust the homeless center, no one seems to have seen it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Athos Monteclaro, a Southern Baptist minister who serves as the 
center's administrator, has organized a volunteer security force to patrol the 
neighborhood 12 hours a day and to minimize the negative behavior of some of 
the homeless people. "We are really interested in solving these problems," 
Monteclaro said. "I don't think anyone could say of me that I haven't been 
responsive." 
</P>
<P>
What many of the neighbors do say is that the security patrol is ineffective. 
Limited in its scope and resources, they say, it is like a Band-Aid on a shark 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
And so an uncomfortable truce of sorts seems to have been forged. On one side 
are the neighbors, who complain constantly about the center's presence but 
appear to have made no organized effort to challenge it. On the other side are 
Christian Outreach Appeal administrators, who say they are concerned about the 
neighbors' feelings but are often accused of being insensitive to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that the group is trying to do something good," resident Johnson 
said, "but, my God, they should be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Said Monteclaro: "(The neighbors') attitude is that we shouldn't be here 
because we are disturbing the peace. That isn't Christian. If we wouldn't help, 
who would?"

FLOOD OF STUDENTS BRINGS RETURN OF BUSING AT SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
WITH ENROLLMENT NEARING RECORD, YEAR-ROUND SESSIONS ARE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Enrollment in the Glendale Unified School District has boomed beyond 
projections again this year, forcing the district to initiate busing at two 
schools -- the first such move in more than two decades, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to deal with the problem, the Board of Education on Tuesday 
appointed a 25-member task force to consider, among other things, the 
possibility of initiating voluntary year-round schools in the crowded district. 
The committee will hold its initial meeting Monday and plans to complete its 
study by February. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment had climbed to 24,170 by Monday, about 670 more students than the 
district had expected. The figure is a 6.5% increase over the number of 
students -- 22,703 -- enrolled at this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said new students normally continue to enroll for about the first six 
weeks of school, which could bring the district near the record enrollment of 
almost 25,000 reached in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Schools 
</P>
<P>
Compounding matters, the district has five fewer campuses because of schools 
closed from 1979 to 1983 during a steady decline in enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Today's burgeoning population may force significant changes in policies and 
school boundaries in the district, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always believed very strongly in the neighborhood school concept," 
said Donald W. Empey, deputy superintendent of instruction. "But we can no 
longer deal with the growing enrollment on individual school campuses." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the district has added portable classrooms at campuses to 
accommodate students -- about 65 portables are in use -- but new state laws 
that take effect in January will restrict the use of portables, said David M. 
Kanthak, assistant superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Campuses 
</P>
<P>
In addition, most of the school sites in the district are relatively small and 
portable buildings encroach on playgrounds and parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
The district is adding 92 permanent classrooms at five schools in the downtown 
area -- Horace Mann, John Marshall, John Muir and Thomas Jefferson 
elementaries, and Hoover High. But even that will not be enough to provide 
classrooms for a student population that has grown from 19,800 to more than 
24,000 in just the last five years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Busing became necessary for the first time this year after it was eliminated 
almost 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
All new enrollment has been halted at two elementary schools in southeast 
Glendale -- Marshall and Mann -- where capacity was reached less than two weeks 
after school began Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Only 18 students living within the boundaries of Marshall and Mann are riding 
vans to nearby Glenoaks and Cerritos elementary schools, Empey said, but the 
number of students bused is expected to continue to swell during the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment also neared capacity at Eleanor J. Toll Junior High School on the 
midwest side of town, but officials said that as of Tuesday, busing did not 
appear necessary there. The most logical alternative site for Toll had appeared 
to be Rosemont Junior High in La Crescenta, a move that would have forced 
students to travel a considerable distance from their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the larger-than-projected enrollment to changing 
demographics, mostly in the mid-city and southeast Glendale areas, where new 
immigrant families appear to be living two and three to a household. The 
district plans to conduct a survey to determine how extensive the trend is 
toward multifamily households.

SCOPE: THE 'WHITTIER WALKER,' A.K.A. 'VIOLIN MAN' BOWS HIS WAY INTO LEGEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Elston Johnson hobbles slowly through Central Park in Whittier, hunching 
slightly as he holds a violin case. With his red cap, long white beard and 
plump belly, which makes him look a little like Santa Claus, Johnson 
immediately catches the attention of children playing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
He turns his head and smiles. Then he plops down in a chair, carefully takes 
out his violin and starts to play "Old MacDonald Had a Farm" while the 
youngsters gather around. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 25 years Johnson has put on hundreds of similar impromptu concerts 
in the parks and on the sidewalks, in the alleys and on the streets of 
Whittier. Johnson -- friendly and gentle-mannered -- has become a local legend. 
</P>
<P>
Around town some people call him the "Violin Man." Others call him the 
"Whittier Walker." 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson was younger he walked between 10 and 25 miles a day through 
Whittier, playing his fiddle. But Johnson, 76, does not get around like before. 
According to Paul French, a friend of his, the musician's health is failing. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, French and his wife, Gladys, both social workers, said 
they found Johnson sitting on a curb, hardly able to move. They took him to his 
home, a bungalow he inherited from his parents, and found it a shambles. 
</P>
<P>
They helped him clean up his house and get back on his feet. Most of all, they 
encouraged Johnson to keep fiddling. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson is feeling up to it, the Frenches drive him to a park, street 
corner or anywhere he can play his carefree tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said his repertoire includes Mozart and Gershwin, but he prefers the 
more popular ditties, such as "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling" or "Let Me Call You 
Sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
He puts on the impromptu concerts because he loves music and fresh air, he 
said, adding that he does not play for handouts. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he started walking and fiddling in 1964, shortly after his parents 
died. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no use sitting around and feeling sorry for myself," he said. At the 
time, it was Johnson's way of handling grief, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For as long as Johnson has been walking the streets, rumors about him have 
circulated among residents. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents said they thought Johnson was homeless and owned only the cloth 
on his back and his old violin. Other residents said they wondered if he was 
crazy. And some speculated that he might be a miser with a fortune stashed away 
someplace. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scoffs when told about the rumors. He says he is not crazy and he's 
"got the papers to prove it." And he says he is not rich, but he is not poor 
either, although there was a time before his Social Security checks started 
arriving when he had to sell almost all his belongings to get by. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was born in Whittier in 1913, one of five children. He graduated from 
Whittier High School in 1933 and attended Whittier College, where he studied 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Johnson worked as a groundskeeper at the college and continued living at 
home with his parents. He never married. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Johnson has been the subject of several portraits by local 
artists. Wanda Riske, a local artist, said she has sold about 800 prints of a 
portrait she painted of Johnson for the Whittier Historical Museum collection 
about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"As I began getting into this thing, I realized how popular he is," Riske said. 
"Whether it be children or adults, people see his picture and say, 'There's the 
old guy with the fiddle.' We've seen him for so many years, he's just a legend 
in his own time." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Bill Bell, managing editor of the Daily News in Whittier, started a 
fund to erect a statue of Johnson. About $1,200 has been raised so far. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson grins when he is told that some residents regard him as a local legend. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm just a well-known figure around town," he said. Then, with his 
blue eyes sparkling, he asks: "How about another song?" 
</P>

money. RICK CORRALES / Los Angeles Times

VENTURA, OXNARD PLAN TO CELEBRATE OPENINGS OF 2 NEW BEACH PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNA GOWENLOCK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those who didn't do enough picnicking, strolling or just plain hanging out 
at the beach this summer, Saturday may be the perfect time to catch up with a 
day at the park. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura and Oxnard city officials are staging opening-day celebrations at two 
new beachfront parks, Surfers' Point in Ventura and Oxnard State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
New parks don't come cheap, city officials in Oxnard and Ventura say. Ventura's 
Surfers' Point and nearby shoreline improvements cost $3.1 million in city, 
state and federal money, while Oxnard city officials estimate that Oxnard State 
Beach cost $3.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state owns the land the Oxnard State Beach is built upon, it 
agreed in 1983 to allow the city to design, develop and operate the new park. 
The park now offers a volleyball court, softball field, bicycle and pedestrian 
pathways and picnic area. Officials plan to add more picnic shelters, an 
exercise course and children's play area by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard planted nearly 400 palm trees along the park's winding promenade, said 
David Gorcey, an Oxnard Parks and Recreation Department landscape architect who 
helped design the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Every coastal community has something they point to as their 'palm park,' and 
we've sort of joined the bunch with this one," Gorcey said. 
</P>
<P>
He said it will take about 90 years for the palms to reach their full height of 
60 to 70 feet. The tallest now are about 16 feet and about 25 years old, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With 62 acres and 372 palm trees, the Oxnard beach park is much larger than 
Ventura's five-acre Surfers' Point. But the Surfers' Point project, equipped 
with a new bicycle path, a new street for better access and two parking lots 
that together can hold nearly 400 cars, hasn't been without problems.

When Ventura city officials first proposed to improve the shoreline area around 
Surfers' Point in the mid-1970s, surfers worried that building a rock wall on 
the shore to protect the improvements from erosion would disrupt the "wave 
action" that has made the area a popular surfing spot. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to those concerns, the city decided to move the proposed 
improvements, such as a new road, further inland, said Miriam Mack, Ventura 
redevelopment administrator. Although the physical improvements won't hinder 
the waves, some surfers now worry that the influx of people into the new park 
will crowd out surfers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to mean more people coming around, which is good for businesses, I 
suppose, but it's always been a real popular surfing spot, and hopefully people 
will respect it and not leave trash and stuff around for those of us who go 
there a lot," said Maria Eubanks, an Oxnard surfer who manages Waveline 
Ventura, a surf shop. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard State Beach dedication ceremonies will include a 7 a.m. sunrise nature 
walk conducted by state park rangers; an 8 a.m. 5K Dedication Run, a one-mile 
fun run/walk and the park dedication at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard State Beach park is at 1601 N. Harbor Blvd., south of Oxnard Shores and 
next to the Embassy Suites Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's grand opening festivities at Surfers' Point, which is at the end of 
Figueroa Street near the Ventura County Fairgrounds, will include a surf 
contest, which will have its qualifying heats at 7:30 a.m.; a 10-mile family 
bicycle ride, and a two-mile walk along San Buenaventura State Beach at 8:30 
a.m. The entry fees for the bike ride and beach walk are $5 for adults and 
$3.50 for children 12 and under. Children under six are free. 
</P>
<P>
The official opening ceremonies at 9:30 a.m. will include a sky-diving and air 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Both park dedications are free.

POLICE RESPONSE FEE FOR FALSE ALARMS HIKED TO $300 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of a false alarm just went up. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials Tuesday nearly tripled the fee charged to home and 
business owners when their alarms are mistakenly set off. The fee increased 
from $104 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
Police begin charging a fee for each false alarm after the fourth one. They do 
not charge for the first four false alarms within a 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
The fee had not been increased in five years, "and, thus, has not kept pace 
with the increase in associated response costs," Police Chief Lawrence Binkley 
wrote in a memo to the City Council.

COUNCIL CERTIFIES RESULTS OF FAILED UTILITY TAX ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Park City Council on Tuesday certified the results of last 
week's special election on a proposed 7% utility tax, which was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Nine hundred people -- about 64% -- voted against the proposed tax on 
electricity, natural gas, water and telephone usage, City Clerk Marilyn Boyette 
said Wednesday. The tax was favored by 507 of those voting. A simple majority 
was required for passage. 
</P>
<P>
Money from the utility tax was to have been used for employee raises and to 
hire 15 more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved a $27.8-million austerity budget during the summer 
that includes no raises for the city's 200 employees. The council also cut 
spending by more than $150,000 in various areas. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are reviewing the budget for additional spending cuts to free 
money for employee raises, among other things, Chief Administrative Officer 
Donald L. Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
The three associations that represent city employees agreed to work at last 
year's pay levels pending the outcome of the election. Negotiations with those 
associations are scheduled for next month.

WORLD VISION HELPS RESTORE LIFE TO FAMINE-STRUCK ETHIOPIAN DUST BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, Mohammed Said abandoned his barren farm and made the three-hour 
trip by foot to the relief center in Ethiopia's Ansokia Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The famine that was ravaging the country had claimed the lives of his child, 
his mother and his father-in-law. And it almost claimed his. Said had to be fed 
for six months before he could muster the strength to leave the camp, with a 
dairy cow and a loom, given to him by relief center workers to start his life 
anew. 
</P>
<P>
Today Said, 45, weaves for a living and has four children, two supported by a 
program sponsored by Monrovia-based World Vision. 
</P>
<P>
Streams are flowing in the valley again, and cattle graze on lush grass. Nearly 
6 million young trees planted after the height of the famine are now thriving. 
The 34,000 villagers in Ansokia consider themselves more prosperous today than 
they have been in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
It is a miraculous turnaround for an area that five years ago was a dust bowl; 
in the area near the relief site, as many as 15 people were dying of hunger 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
"Ansokia is one of our best efforts," said Bruce Brander of World Vision, the 
relief organization assigned to the drought-stricken valley 250 miles north of 
Addis Ababa. 
</P>
<P>
The Arcadia resident recently visited the region's 17 villages to document 
their progress on the fifth anniversary of the famine. The final death toll in 
the country exceeded 1 million, Brander said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the valley is green from end to end," said Brander, crediting 
irrigation and reforestation efforts as well as the return of the rains for the 
transformation. The inhabitants are rejoicing that leopards, which started 
disappearing decades ago as the villagers denuded the land of trees for fuel, 
have returned, signifying the success of the replanting. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the crisis of saving lives is past, development work is under way to 
"famine-proof" the 35-mile-long valley dotted with thatched homes of mud and 
stone, Brander said. 
</P>
<P>
Terraces with water catchment areas have been created for farming, stone 
reservoirs have been built and wells are being drilled. The villagers 
previously relied on streams for their water, Brander said. The work paid off 
when the valley survived a drought in 1988, remaining green and fertile. 
</P>
<P>
The region's first high school is being built. Sanitation is taught with songs: 
a hand-washing song, a diarrhea song. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, World Vision has distributed $731,310 in international aid in 
Ansokia alone, Brander said. Some 7,135 children in the valley are provided 
with daily necessities, medical care and an education through the sponsorship 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Only eight World Vision consultants, native specialists in agriculture or 
medicine, remain in Ansokia, and they plan to withdraw as the villagers get 
back on their feet. As one farmer told Brander: "We're looking to the day when 
the donor can leave." 
</P>
<P>
For Brander, who returned from Ethiopia in August, traipsing around the globe 
has become almost routine. Within the last year, the former journalist and 
one-time National Geographic Society photographer has recorded World Vision 
rescue efforts from the Armenia earthquake to the Bangladesh flood. 
</P>
<P>
Capturing a revitalized Ansokia on film was a relatively cheerful assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"Photographing the people was a treat," he said. "They and their activities 
were just eminently pictorial. They're very, very handsome." A far cry from the 
haggard faces and bony frames that haunted feeding camps just five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The big question on everybody's minds has been: 'Is all that money poured in 
today to save people who would die tomorrow?' It seems that bloated bellies and 
dying children attract donors to help, but we'd like to get in there and 
prevent that," Brander said.

EPPLE'S VOTE WAS FOR CONSTITUENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to the article by Mark Gladstone concerning 
Assemblyman Bob Epple (Times, Sept. 10). The story states that Epple voted 
against the ban on semiautomatic weapons. Assemblyman Epple did not bow to the 
pressure of the NRA (National Rifle Assn.). He voted the way his constituents 
wanted him to vote. Mail and calls concerning the ban to the assemblyman's 
office were running 8 to 1 against it. 
</P>
<P>
I don't believe you realize who the NRA is. It is not some mysterious, 
behind-the-scenes council that sways lawmaker opinions. It is made up of people 
who share like interests, just like sports car clubs or softball teams. We pay 
$25 a year dues to belong to this group and have someone in Washington and 
Sacramento speak for us just as Handgun Control Inc. pays to have someone speak 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
We are not all pot-bellied Uzi toters as another article described us. As a 
matter of fact, most of us do not own military look-alikes listed on the ban. I 
certainly don't. But I would defend a person's right to legally own and shoot 
the gun of his or her choice. 
</P>
<P>
There were over 3 million of us before that maniac, Patrick Purdy (Stockton 
schoolyard murderer), came into the picture. But now the membership has grown 
by leaps and bounds to a record number because of the issue. That number does 
not take into consideration those on the fringe who own guns but do not belong 
to the NRA. At last count, there are more than 50 million gun owners in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. (George) Deukmejian admitted that the calls and letters against the 
semiautomatics were substantially more numerous than those for the ban. As for 
how much more, we will never know. His office will not release that 
information. 
</P>
<P>
So who is backing the wishes of the people in this fight? Who has their fingers 
on the pulse of the people? Mr. Epple and his colleagues in the Assembly who 
voted against the ban are the only ones I see.

TEMPLE CITY RETAINS ITS SIGN LAW BUT WON'T ENFORCE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though two civil rights law groups have criticized a Temple City ordinance 
that requires that half of any business sign use Roman characters, the City 
Council didn't blink on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't respond well to intimidation," said Councilman Ken Gillanders, who 
supported the ordinance when it was adopted in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed not to rescind the ordinance but instructed the city staff 
not to enforce it while modifications are being considered -- a move that 
apparently mollified opponents of the sign law. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we can come to a compromise we can live with, no legal action would 
be taken," said Kathryn Imahara, attorney for the Asian Pacific American Legal 
Center of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Imahara said, however, that suspending enforcement wouldn't be enough. "As far 
as we're concerned, just lifting the enforcement still has a chilling effect 
because the city can always turn around again and enforce it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based legal center had joined forces with the American Civil 
Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California to challenge the ordinance, 
which they said is discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
The law groups are willing to help Temple City "pull together an ordinance that 
meets the needs of the city and which withstands constitutional challenge," 
Imahara said. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City's ordinance was adopted in part because law enforcement officials 
said they might have trouble finding addresses while responding to emergencies. 
Also, some residents hoped to prevent a proliferation of foreign-language 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Pitts, a 25-year resident of Temple City, said after Tuesday's meeting that 
he supports the ordinance "because I want to be able to drive down the streets 
and be able to recognize what kind of commercial vendors are there. It's not my 
goal to learn the foreign languages." 
</P>
<P>
The decision not to rescind the ordinance didn't dissuade attorneys for the two 
civil rights groups from planning to challenge similar ordinances in San 
Gabriel, Rosemead and Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Letters asking those three cities to voluntarily rescind language requirements 
in their sign ordinances will be sent soon, Imahara said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar ordinance in Pomona was struck down in July by U.S. District Judge 
Robert Takasugi, who said language requirements in that city violated 
residents' constitutional rights to free speech and commercial speech and 
discriminated on the basis of national origin. After that ruling, Temple City 
suspended enforcement of its own ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona city officials have chosen not to appeal Takasugi's ruling, making the 
decision binding on Southern California communities that still have such 
ordinances on their books, Imahara said. 
</P>
<P>
In a Sept. 6 letter to Temple City officials, attorneys for the two groups 
asked the council to voluntarily repeal its ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Patrick Froehle said the council is not saying it will never rescind the 
ordinance. "We really don't have facts to make that judgment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Froehle suggested that city officials meet with attorneys for the law groups to 
"at least see what a compromise ordinance would be."

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRIVATE TALKS TO LOOK AT POPULATION CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The challenges arising from Glendale's changing population will be examined by 
business, education and political leaders in a seven-week series of private 
talks beginning this week. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, titled "Understanding Glendale for the Future," will open with an 
invitation-only session from 8 to 11 a.m. Saturday in the City Council Chamber, 
613 E. Broadway. Occidental College President John B. Slaughter will give the 
keynote address. 
</P>
<P>
Participants will then meet on five successive Wednesday evenings in private 
homes to discuss such issues as crime, traffic, transportation, housing, 
education and cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
The forum is sponsored by the city of Glendale, Glendale Community College and 
Glendale Partners, a group of Glendale business owners and chief executive 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, this process will result in a better understanding of each other's 
cultures and an appreciation not only of our differences but also of all the 
things we have in common," said Martha Thayer, chairman of the education/ethnic 
mix committee of Glendale Partners, which organized the forum. 
</P>
<P>
A closing session will be held Nov. 2.

EASY WIN NO GAUGE FOR FRANKLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gary Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Franklin High football team left only one question unanswered last week 
after rolling over Roosevelt, 41-7, in its opener. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we're that good or they just didn't play as well as they can," 
Franklin Coach Armando Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez should get a better indication of his team's ability on Friday when 
the Panthers take on powerful Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, in the first football game ever played between the two schools, 
Franklin upset the Highlanders, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
With senior quarterback Santiago Alvarez leading the way, the Panthers seem to 
have all the necessary ingredients to knock off Granada Hills again. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez completed 29 of 41 passes for 335 yards and four touchdowns against 
Roosevelt. He scrambled from the pocket effectively and, as his statistics 
indicate, had little problem finding open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Split end Lamar Lovett caught six passes for 75 yards and two touchdowns and 
running back Benny Gallo had eight catches for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Franklin defense also was impressive, intercepting four passes and 
recovering two fumbles. Roosevelt's only touchdown came on a kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Panthers do the same thing to Granada Hills, a 17-14 winner last week 
over Westchester? 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a good game for us to see if we're really that good," 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
The more the merrier: Now that school is in session and the annual influx of 
transferring students has begun, there may be some relief in sight for the 
Marshall High football team. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 14-6 season-opening loss to Garfield, Marshall used just 14 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with everything we did -- we executed well," Marshall Coach Ken 
Gerard said. "We just can't have those kids playing that much. They just ran 
out of gas." 
</P>
<P>
About 65 players have filed out to practice since school began, so Gerard is 
hopeful that he will have plenty of eligible players for Friday's game at 
Grant.

"We've been giving out all kinds of equipment," Gerard said. "We'll see if it 
makes a difference." 
</P>

Zero hour: Occidental's 14-0 loss to Azusa Pacific last Saturday was the 
Tigers' first shutout defeat since 1985, when Central College of Iowa 
administered a 71-0 beating in the second round of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's loss was the first regular season shutout defeat since 1980 when the 
Tigers lost to Redlands, 48-0. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Azusa Pacific shut out Occidental was in 1974, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Occidental (0-2) lost two games in a row was in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In passing: Occidental has surrendered four touchdowns this season -- each on 
passes of 26 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have been handicapped by injuries to key players such as cornerback 
Ben White and safety Craig Hartley, but Tiger Coach Dale Widolff said the 
problem has been lapses, not personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing pretty good pass defense," said Widolff, whose team has three 
interceptions. "We're getting good pressure. It's just the inconsistency, We've 
broken down at critical times." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing is believing: John Cicuto and his Glendale College staff got an eyeful 
last Saturday when they took advantage of their team's bye and journeyed to 
Bakersfield to scout the defending national champion Renegades. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield whipped Hancock, 29-6, in preparation for Saturday's Western State 
Conference opener against Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Bakersfield) have some very big lineman and good skill-position 
players," said Cicuto, whose team lost its opener to Pasadena. "The week off 
has been good for us. It's allowed us to simplify some things for our players. 
I think it's going to be an excellent game." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale and Bakersfield did not play last season, but Glendale won the last 
two meetings between the schools in 1986 and '87.

PEACEABLE FEAST;

STARS TURN OUT IN SANTA MONICA TO HONOR ANTI-NUCLEAR PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was a party out of the pages of the Whole Earth Catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night the Westside chapter of the anti-nuclear group SANE/FREEZE held 
a celebration honoring local politicians arrested in 1987 while demonstrating 
at a Nevada nuclear test site. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians, who included Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane and former mayor 
James Conn, received plaques bearing plastic handcuffs like the ones slapped on 
them when they were arrested. Actor-activist Martin Sheen bear-hugged special 
guest Cesar Chavez. The 400 participants watched a video on the plight of 
California farm workers, took free rides on the Santa Monica Pier Carousel and 
bopped to the sounds of an Amer-Asian "surf-rockabilly" group called Soy 
Cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, no table grapes were served, but there were free Peace Pops 
from Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade ice-cream company and Nuclear Freeze bars from 
a Los Angeles health-food firm called Garden of Eatin'. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of event fits very neatly into the Santa Monica spirit," said Zane, 
who characterized the city as one that "encourages free expression for a lot of 
diverse views." 
</P>
<P>
To receive his award, Zane wore what could almost be called a Santa Monica 
tuxedo -- jeans and a sport jacket. The mayor said he had practiced a quip for 
the occasion: "This is the first time I've ever been honored for being busted." 
In fact, he said, he had never been busted before for anything but a traffic 
violation. "There's no question that it's a rite of passage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow honoree Judy Abdo, Santa Monica city councilwoman, reminisced fondly 
about the experience, which she speculated had helped her get elected. Her only 
complaint was that she had been handcuffed too tightly, and "We didn't even get 
to go to jail." The arrested politicians included City Council members Jim 
Rosenberger of Hermosa Beach, Daniel Tabor of Inglewood, David Finkel of Santa 
Monica, and Helen Albert, John Heilman and Paul Koretz, all of West Hollywood. 
They were booked and released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt right at home coming here, because I've been across that line quite a 
number of times in recent years," said Sheen, who has been active in 
SANE/FREEZE and has been arrested for civil disobedience. Sheen praised the 
public officials who were being honored. "To have a respected member of the 
community, a leader of the community, take such a brave action is inspirational 
to everyone in the community," he said. "Public service can be very risky when 
it's done honestly." He laughed. "It can be very risky when it's done 
dishonestly, too," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Choice of Events 
</P>
<P>
Sheen said he had chosen the pier party over the peer party taking place in 
Pasadena because "this is far more important than the Emmys." Actress Susan 
Clark agreed. "I'm not sure going to the Emmys would make any difference for 
the future of our children," Clark said. Her choice, she said, set a better 
example for her children. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, president of the United Farmworkers and described by Sheen as one of 
his heroes, lauded the politicians who had acted on their anti-nuclear 
convictions. "It's really not that difficult for me," said Chavez, "because I 
don't have to come back and face the voters." Chavez expressed his support for 
many of the liberal causes championed by the participants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very large world," he said, "and there are many issues we should be 
concerned about -- peace and justice and pesticides and the RAND Corp.!" When 
Chavez declared: "No grapes -- nowhere," he received a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ben &amp; Jerry's Fans 
</P>
<P>
The event was a benefit for Westside SANE/FREEZE. According to coordinator 
Andrew Tonkovich, the party raised about $10,000 for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Tonkovich also reported that the celebrants polished off 500 Peace Pops in the 
course of the evening, including all the Cherry Garcia-flavored ones. 
Manufacturer Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc. has won a following among liberal 
ice-cream lovers because of the firm's contributions to peace groups and other 
activist organizations and such corporate practices as limiting the founders' 
salaries because, as Ben Cohen once told an interviewer, "No one deserves to 
make the kind of money big business people make." Besides, it tastes every bit 
as good as ice cream made by companies with less politically correct policies. 
</P>
<P>
Tonkovich was grateful to Ben &amp; Jerry's, and he certainly agreed with their 
ideological position, but he was a little concerned about their ingredients' 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"People consumed a lot of ice cream," Tonkovich said. "It was too much sugar, 
but it was for a good cause."

WRITERS GUILD'S EXPANSION PLANS GET TENTATIVE OK; 
</P>
<P>
W. HOLLYWOOD COUNCIL REVERSES BOARD RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSANNE KEYNAN, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overturning a unanimous decision by its Planning Commission, the West Hollywood 
City Council voted this week to conditionally approve expansion of the Writers 
Guild of America West Inc. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 people in the standing-room-only audience at West Hollywood Park 
Auditorium on Monday night rose to speak before the council voted 4 to 1 to 
grant an appeal by the screenwriters' union that would permit construction of 
additional offices, a parking garage and two residential townhouse units on its 
property off Beverly Boulevard at Almont Drive and Rosewood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval of construction is contingent upon several changes in design and 
landscaping that would make the project less objectionable to residents who are 
concerned about its size and impact on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A City Council staff report addressing these concerns recommended that the 
council overturn the Planning Commission's decision to deny construction 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appeal Should Be Denied' 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the planning board, Commissioner Steve Smith told the council, 
"The commission unanimously and very strongly feels the appeal should be 
denied." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the commission "is not shy about adding 20 items to mitigate the 
negative impact of a project. We could not find any mitigation that would be 
sufficient here. The fate of a stable, coherent neighborhood is being forfeited 
to P.R. concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Several guild representatives said the union must expand its headquarters or 
leave West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Tom Mesereau reminded the council that the guild is "not a business, 
or a real estate investment firm. We operate at a deficit." He said the guild 
has been a "good citizen" of West Hollywood by making its boardroom and theater 
on Doheny Avenue available for city functions, by keeping its script library 
open to the public and by its members' participation in volunteer projects in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Karen Clark, a West Hollywood resident and guild member 
whose writing credits include "The Long Journey Home," admitted that she was 
nervous about addressing her colleagues who had come to speak for guild 
expansion, even though "I give the guild a lot of money." Clark, who lives on 
Rosewood, said she feared that the commercialization would set a precedent for 
the rest of her block. 
</P>
<P>
Clark believes that the expansion is unnecessary. "I've seen how many employees 
they have -- only 74," she said. "Most of our meetings don't take place at the 
guild anyway. We meet at the Writers Guild Theater or at the Palladium." 
</P>
<P>
Professional writers were not only outnumbered at the meeting, they were also 
outstripped rhetorically by members of homeowners groups and residents. One 
member of the West Hollywood West homeowners association called the expansion 
"a cancer in the neighborhood." Another said construction would "stifle the 
cool breezes and create a mini-greenhouse effect" on the block. 
</P>
<P>
When Ethel Shapiro, a community activist and gadfly, asked audience members 
opposing the project to stand, about two-thirds of those in attendance rose to 
their feet. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing more than threehours of emotionally charged testimony, council 
members spoke about the difficulty of the decision. Paul Koretz said: "One of 
the treasures we were given upon cityhood was the Writers Guild. The other 
treasure was a single-family (residence) neighborhood. I don't want to see the 
neighborhood ruined. I don't want to see the Writers Guild lost." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Albert said she feared that, if the Writers Guild appeal were denied and 
the union were to vacate its headquarters, "someone else would do something far 
worse to the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Councilman Steve Schulte cast the lone dissenting vote, saying the 
council may have erred when it initially changed the property's zoning to 
commercial in adopting the city's General Plan last year. "It is not beyond us 
to admit that there might have been a mistake," he said. "That's what the 
planning commission has seen. We have to come to grips with that." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the vote, Smith said, "The council acted for honorable reasons but 
came to a regrettable decision." He attributed the vote to "chamber of 
commerce-type thinking. We have one good Chamber of Commerce already. The 
council may be turning itself into a second one, regrettably at the expense of 
the neighborhoods. If it lost the guild, the city would suffer a temporary P.R. 
setback. But the loss of the neighborhood is permanent."

FUTURE IFFY ON BILL TO CONTROL ILLEGAL ROADS IN SANTA MONICAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Santa Monica Mountains preservationists urged its approval, Gov. George 
Deukmejian is expected to act soon on a bill that would enable the California 
Coastal Commission to crack down faster on illegal bulldozing and 
road-building. 
</P>
<P>
But commission officials are prepared for the governor to veto the legislation, 
sponsored by state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). Deukmejian is a longtime 
antagonist of the coastal protection agency and has cut its budget in five of 
the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Commission officials asked Davis to carry the bill on the theory that, 
as a conservative Republican, he would get a sympathetic hearing from 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restraining Order 
</P>
<P>
Davis' legislation would give Coastal Commission officials power to issue 
immediate stop-work orders against developers who break state coastal 
preservation laws. It also provides for fines of up to $6,000 a day against 
developers who ignore such orders. 
</P>
<P>
The commission must now ask the state attorney general to get a judge to issue 
a temporary restraining order to halt alleged violations. If a restraining 
order is violated, the court can impose fines of as much as $5,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cave, the commission's only statewide enforcement officer, said that 
process often takes a week, a period that is often sufficient for developers to 
complete their illegal work. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal grading and road construction have become problems in the Santa Monica 
Mountains and along the Malibu coast, where the lure of enormous profits to be 
made from building expensive homes far exceeds the threat of state fines for 
developers who build roads or landscape illegally, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
A staff shortage has left the commission with a backlog of more than 600 such 
alleged violations statewide, more than half of them in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties, Cave said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20% in Mountains 
</P>
<P>
Cave, who supervises five part-time enforcement officers, said the commission 
is able to pursue only about 75 of the most serious violations at any one time. 
About 20% of those cases have occurred in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The Davis bill would authorize the commission to issue a stop-work order in a 
single day, quickly halting further environmental damage, she said. "We'd be 
taken more seriously by the community of alleged violators," Cave said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, a state agency that buys land for the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area, said the bill, if enacted, would provide an effective 
weapon against "midnight bulldozing operations." 
</P>
<P>
He cited a fire road in upper Ramirez Canyon behind Malibu that state officials 
say was paved recently without permits. He said that the road was completed 
over a weekend and that coastal officials should have had the authority to halt 
such a project immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is opposed by the California Chamber of Commerce and the 
California Farm Bureau Federation, which argue that it infringes on property 
owners' rights. 
</P>
<P>
John Gamper, a farm bureau spokesman, said the bill damages owners' due-process 
rights by giving blanket authority to state bureaucrats to order construction 
projects stopped immediately, rather than turning disputes over to a judge, who 
would make a decision after hearing both sides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue of Time 
</P>
<P>
But commission officials noted that the bill would require them to notify 
developers before issuing a 60-day stop-work order and that the order could be 
challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former Los Angeles police chief who has sharply criticized the Coastal 
Commission, said his bill is a law-and-order issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no reason to obey the law now because of the law of 
economics," he said. "We shouldn't sanction these kinds of criminals." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he will press Deukmejian Administration officials to support his 
bill, but a Deukmejian spokesman said the governor "is not expected to look 
favorably on the bill."

ARCADIA RESIDENT SEES FRUITS OF MISSION'S LABORS IN ETHIOPIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, Mohammed Said abandoned his barren farm and made the three-hour 
trip by foot to the relief center in Ethiopia's Ansokia Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The famine that was ravaging the country had claimed the lives of his child, 
his mother and his father-in-law. And it almost claimed his. Said had to be fed 
for six months before he could muster the strength to leave the camp, with a 
dairy cow and a loom, given to him by relief center workers to start his life 
anew. 
</P>
<P>
Today Said, 45, weaves for a living and has four children, two supported by a 
program sponsored by Monrovia-based World Vision. 
</P>
<P>
Streams are flowing in the valley again, and cattle graze on lush grass. Nearly 
6 million young trees planted after the height of the famine are now thriving. 
The 34,000 villagers in Ansokia consider themselves more prosperous today than 
they have been in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
It is a miraculous turnaround for an area that five years ago was a dust bowl; 
in the area near the relief site, as many as 15 people were dying of hunger 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
"Ansokia is one of our best efforts," said Bruce Brander of World Vision, the 
relief organization assigned to the drought-stricken valley 250 miles north of 
Addis Ababa. 
</P>
<P>
The Arcadia resident recently visited the region's 17 villages to document 
their progress on the fifth anniversary of the famine. The final death toll in 
the country exceeded 1 million, Brander said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the valley is green from end to end," said Brander, crediting 
irrigation and reforestation efforts as well as the return of the rains for the 
transformation. The inhabitants are rejoicing that leopards, which started 
disappearing decades ago as the villagers denuded the land of trees for fuel, 
have returned, signifying the success of the replanting. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the crisis of saving lives is past, development work is under way to 
"famine-proof" the 35-mile-long valley dotted with thatched homes of mud and 
stone, Brander said. 
</P>
<P>
Terraces with water catchment areas have been created for farming, stone 
reservoirs have been built and wells are being drilled. The villagers 
previously relied on streams for their water, Brander said. The work paid off 
when the valley survived a drought in 1988, remaining green and fertile. 
</P>
<P>
The region's first high school is being built. Sanitation is taught with songs: 
a hand-washing song, a diarrhea song. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, World Vision has distributed $731,310 in international aid in 
Ansokia alone, Brander said. Some 7,135 children in the valley are provided 
with daily necessities, medical care and an education through the sponsorship 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Only eight World Vision consultants, native specialists in agriculture or 
medicine, remain in Ansokia, and they plan to withdraw as the villagers get 
back on their feet. As one farmer told Brander: "We're looking to the day when 
the donor can leave." 
</P>
<P>
For Brander, who returned from Ethiopia in August, traipsing around the globe 
has become almost routine. Within the last year, the former journalist and 
one-time National Geographic Society photographer has recorded World Vision 
rescue efforts from the Armenia earthquake to the Bangladesh flood. 
</P>
<P>
Capturing a revitalized Ansokia on film was relatively cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
"Photographing the people was a treat," he said. "They and their activities 
were just eminently pictorial. They're very, very handsome." A far cry from the 
haggard faces and bony frames that haunted feeding camps just five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The big question on everybody's minds has been: 'Is all that money poured in 
today to save people who would die tomorrow?' It seems that bloated bellies and 
dying children attract donors to help, but we'd like to get in there and 
prevent that," Brander said. 
</P>
<P>
But long-term development is harder to sell "because it's not as spectacular," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ansokia success proves that the country can be prosperous, he said. "It 
just takes a longer time in some places. The investment is really far less than 
another famine."

BID TO UNSEAT BRYANT BEGINS

<TEXT>
<P>
A group seeking to recall Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant has begun circulating 
petitions, and will need the signatures of 8,304 registered voters by Jan. 12 
to force an election. 
</P>
<P>
Melody Peterson, co-chairman of the Bryant recall committee, said the group has 
distributed 500 petitions to garner the signatures of the necessary 20% of the 
city's registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions accuse Bryant of distorting facts, using the council as a forum 
for vicious personal attacks, and taking a "vindictive, intimidating and 
contemptuous attitude toward this city, its citizens and employees." 
</P>
<P>
In his official response, which is being circulated with the recall petitions, 
Bryant attributes the recall to "a small, special interest group working with 
(Mayor) Donna Smith to divide our city." He said the recall group "has tried to 
undermine the only chance Pomona has for progress." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has denied involvement in the recall.

An expansion of the Cal Poly Pomona Library was dedicated in a ceremony that 
also marked the addition of the repository's 500,000th volume. 
</P>
<P>
University President Hugh La Bounty and library Director Harold Schleifer on 
Monday officially opened the $7.4-million expansion, which added two new floors 
to the three-story library. The expansion can seat 2,600. 
</P>
<P>
"When the university opened in 1938, the library was one room, measuring 33 
feet by 45 feet, so we've come a long way," said Norm Schneider, a university 
spokesman. 
</P>

CITY OFFICIALS GET PAY RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved salary increases for the city attorney, city 
clerk and city manager. 
</P>
<P>
All three appointed positions received cost-of-living increases of 5.1%. With 
the raise, the annual salary of City Atty. Robert M. Myers increases from 
$95,508 to $100,379. Myers was also awarded a performance bonus of $8,500, 
which is 8.9% of his annual salary before the raise. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cost-of-living raise, City Clerk Clarice E. Johnsen also 
received an additional adjustment of 3.9%, based on the salaries of similar 
positions in other cities. Johnsen's annual salary increases from $48,372 to 
$52,725, a total raise of 9%. She also received a performance bonus of $2,419, 
or 5% of her annual salary before the raise. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Jalili received a salary adjustment based on the salaries of 
other city managers. Jalili's performance bonus is incorporated in his total 
annual raise of 21.5%, which increases his annual salary from $97,296 to 
$118,214. 
</P>
<P>
The salary increases are retroactive to July 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 
fiscal year.

WOO, RENEWAL FOES MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a final effort to reach a compromise before a court hearing next month, Los 
Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo met Monday with several foes of the city's 
Hollywood redevelopment project, but the two sides were unable to resolve their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
Woo proposed naming three members of the controversial Hollywood Project Area 
Committee, a citizens advisory group disbanded by the City Council in May, to a 
new advisory panel that he created last month. In exchange, Woo proposed, the 
Project Area Committee and Save Hollywood Our Town, a residents group opposed 
to redevelopment, would drop separate lawsuits against the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Project Area Committee members, who sued the council over its decision to 
disband the group, rejected the offer. They said they want their entire 
25-member group reinstated. They also said they have no authority to speak for 
Save Hollywood Our Town, which filed suit against the city several years ago to 
block the renewal effort.

'CHAIR-ITY' TO BENEFIT CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be 12 empty chairs at an auction Saturday night to benefit the 
Venice Family Clinic building fund. 
</P>
<P>
But don't try to sit on them. The chairs, one of which is adorned with neon 
tubes, twigs and Christmas lights, are works of art that will be auctioned off 
to raise money to expand the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 200 physicians who organized the unusual fund-raiser and dinner 
dubbed it "Sweet Chair-ity." The event will be held at the Holmby Hills home of 
Diane and Stephen Reissman at 7 p.m. Marlene and Dr. Edward Riceberg co-chair 
the fund-raiser with former Dodger Ron Cey and his wife, Fran. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve chairs, ranging from Early American to high-tech, were donated by a 
chair company, said Ellen Robinson, a spokeswoman for the clinic, which serves 
the uninsured working poor and homeless in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary artists then turned the chairs into works of art. The artists 
include Rod Baer, Jackie Draeger, Gregg Fleishman, Candice Gawne, Gronk, Tom 
Jenkins, Connie Mississippi, Greg Petty, Frank Romero and Peter Shire. 
</P>
<P>
Opening bids on the chairs range from $500 to $2,500. The chairs are on display 
at Art Options, 2507 Main St., Venice, through Friday. For information, call 
(213) 392-8630. 
</P>
<P>
Combining art and medicine is a tradition at the Venice Family Clinic. The 
clinic's major yearly fund-raiser is the Venice Art Walk. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds will be added to the nearly $2 million raised as part of a drive to 
triple the size of the Venice Family Clinic, which turned away 6,000 people 
this year because of lack of space, Robinson said. The building fund goal is 
$2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic treated 30,000 patients in 1988, most of them without charge, 
Robinson said.

FATE OF SITE UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the company that hopes to develop the site of the May Co. 
store at Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard said the project may end up 
being an office complex instead of a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Steven P. Albert, president of Forest City Properties Corp., told residents at 
a community meeting last Thursday that it is too early in the planning process 
to know what will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Forest City also plans to expand the nearby Park Labrea residential complex by 
more than 2,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
It is now home to about 10,000 tenants, hundreds of whom crowded a recreation 
room at Park Labrea to find out about Forest City's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them said they were concerned that development of the May Co. site in 
addition to plans for a large-scale shopping center at the Farmers Market 
nearby would worsen traffic and parking problems in the area. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman John Ferarro, who represents the area, has yet to express an 
opinion on the two projects, both of which will require city approval to go 
ahead.

PARAPET SIGNS LIMITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency on Monday voted to cut by half the number of skyline 
parapet signs recommended by the Planning Commission for the Corporate Pointe 
business park on Slauson Avenue near Fox Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to complaints from Culver Crest neighborhood residents who said the 
signs would ruin their view, the agency voted 4 to 1 to decrease from 14 to 
seven the number of illuminated corporate signs allowed. Each of the seven 
buildings that are at least five stories tall will be allowed one parapet sign 
that must be turned off at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Agency member Steven Gourley, who pushed for more restrictive requirements, 
voted against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Robert B. Farrell, vice president of commercial development for Bramalea 
California Inc., the project's developer, opposed the reduction in the number 
of signs. He said signs are needed to draw tenants to Corporate Pointe and are 
vital to its success. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed that cutting the number of signs is a breach of the development 
agreement between the agency and Bramalea, which says that restrictions on the 
project must be commercially reasonable. Bramalea is considering whether to sue 
the agency, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission will hold its annual "Adopt-A-Beach" cleanup 
program at beaches throughout the state Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which asks volunteers to help remove debris from the state's sandy 
waterfront, will start at Malibu's Surfrider Beach beginning at 9 a.m. and will 
include similar stops at beaches in Santa Monica, Playa del Rey and Venice. 
Last year, the program attracted nearly 6,000 volunteers throughout California 
who removed almost 200,000 pounds of debris, according to coastal officials. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about the Malibu Beach cleanup, call (213) 456-4143. Those 
wishing to work in Venice should call (213) 396-8321 or 578-6242. For

DEVELOPMENT PANEL'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pomona City Council has delayed until Oct. 9 a decision on whether to use 
$198,000 in redevelopment funds to restore a city subsidy to the Pomona 
Economic Development Corp., which promotes the city's economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The development panel had been financed by a 30% surcharge on business license 
fees until the council decided in June to terminate its subsidy, effective 
Sept. 15, and use the revenue instead to hire more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The new budget proposed by the agency outlines specific tasks that it would do 
for the city, such as gathering demographic information and persuading 
businesses to establish new facilities in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said the agency is providing worthwhile 
services, but Councilwoman Nell Soto said the agency needs to broaden its goals 
and revamp its board to better represent the community.

DOCTORS TO BUY HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of San Gabriel Valley doctors will purchase West Covina Hospital for 
about $6.5 million from Pasadena-based Paracelsus Healthcare Corp., hospital 
officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
Services at the 60-bed facility will continue without interruption, and a 
women's clinic may eventually be added, said Halden Shane, board president of 
Doctors Hospital of West Covina Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The group of 20 West Covina-based medical specialists first approached 
Paracelsus last summer, and negotiations started in March, said Shane, a 
podiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is expected to be concluded by the end of October, upon approval and 
licensing by the state Department of Health. Paracelsus operates 20 hospitals 
in the United States and 42 in Europe.

WATSON OPPOSES HONORARIUM BAN; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATOR SAYS REFORM MEASURE FOR JUNE BALLOT GOES 'TOO FAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that "we've gone a little too far," Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) 
last week was among only three state senators to object to a new ethics 
standard that includes a ban on honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
The measure -- to place a proposed constitutional amendment on next June's 
ballot -- was approved by the Senate on a 33-3 vote and by the Assembly 68 to 
7. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) would 
limit the acceptance of gifts by legislators, restrict lobbying by former 
lawmakers for a year after they leave the Legislature and require legislative 
committees to hold their meetings in public. It was among dozens of pieces of 
legislation approved before the Legislature ended its 1989 session Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
During a Senate floor debate, Watson asserted that "these kinds of 
restrictions" would prevent poor people and minorities from running for office 
"because they are not going to (be able to) afford to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
Watson told her colleagues: "We ought to be ethical in what we do, but I think 
in some ways . . . we've gone a little too far." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Far Enough 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) also expressed concern about the 
proposal but said it failed to go far enough toward reform. Hayden did not vote 
on the constitutional amendment, saying he favored delaying a decision until 
the Legislature reconvenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after Friday's action, Watson maintained that her vote was not 
a protest against ethics but against the cumulative effect of the proposal's 
limits on outside income, gifts and speaking fees combined with curbs on 
campaign fund raising approved by voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, first elected in 1978, represents an area that incudes Marina del Rey, 
Playa del Rey, Baldwin Hills and much of the Wilshire District. 
</P>
<P>
The senator raised her objections one day after Sacramento County prosecutors 
announced that there was insufficient evidence to seek criminal charges against 
Watson for using state-paid staff and equipment in preparing her doctoral 
dissertation and managing a private rental property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shadow of Impropriety' 
</P>
<P>
During the Senate debate, Watson cited the investigation, saying: "We always 
operate under a shadow of impropriety. I just came through that myself." 
</P>
<P>
But the potential for legislative misconduct, she said, is an insufficient 
reason for imposing new curbs. "I can't identify a person in the Legislature 
who I think is bought by outside interests," she said. "But as we rush to judge 
and we rush to reform, it's almost giving support to the claims that we are all 
corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
The new ethical standards for lawmakers would be linked to the creation of an 
independent salary commission that would have sole authority to decide on the 
level of pay for lawmakers. Legislators now receive $40,816 a year plus a 
tax-free expense allowance of $88 a day when the Legislature is in session and 
during legislative breaks when they attend hearings or conduct other 
legislative business. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said she believes that the legislative salary should be at least $80,000 
a year but voiced concern that the commission might not raise it high enough. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my entire income," Watson said. "I have no independent wealth." 
</P>
<P>
In her annual statement of economic interests for 1988, Watson reported 
collecting more than $23,000 in speaking fees, gifts and travel expenses. By 
comparison, Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), one of the 
Legislature's top speechmakers, reported collecting $46,900 in speaking fees 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, who favored putting over the matter until January, remarked that "it is 
going to be seen as curious that in response to an ethics crisis we have voted 
ourselves a salary commission." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden also said he believes that voters would support the pay-raise panel "if 
they felt we were reforming ourselves more radically than we are in this 
package." 
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was supported by the rest of the Westside Senate delegation: 
Roberti, Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) and Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), 
who represents Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, Los Angeles Democrats Terry B. Friedman, Burt Margolin, Mike 
Roos and Gwen Moore, who all represent parts of the Westside, voted for the 
bill.

WORKERS' CLAIMS OFFICE MOVE QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 30 years, the Workers Compensation Appeals Board has had an office in 
Ventura for the adjudication of work injuries. It is well situated with 
adequate parking, proximity to the government center, freeway and public 
transportation. It is also in, and next to, the largest and fourth-largest 
cities in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The state has recently remodeled the building and has, within the last month, 
installed up-to-date computers with dedicated electrical outlets and wiring. It 
is a model office, especially when compared to other regional officers such as 
Van Nuys were overcrowded conditions make it unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
Now the state has announced its decision to move it to Los Angeles County 
because of demographics. No one was consulted, and no one was asked for input 
prior to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
I oppose this decision. So does Rep. Bob Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), state Sen. 
Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), the 
board's employees, the injured workers, the judges, the lawyers, the insurance 
carriers, the Ventura County Bar Assn. and Channel Counties Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
It simply does not make sense because it is illogical and bad business. No 
private company would waste that much money in remodeling computers and wiring 
one month before making a decision to move 34 miles away.

DIAMOND BAR COUNCIL SHOULD STUDY STATE LAW 
</P>

<P>
Dictatorship is alive and well, and if you have any doubts, just attend a

I attended one on Sept. 5 and was shocked and appalled by the way it was

I might suggest to this council that they study the Brown Act very carefully as 
they are constantly in violation. Robert's Rules and Order is another piece of 
literature they should consider reading. 
</P>
<P>
I was treated with politeness, and for that, I thank them, but this same 
courtesy was not extended to every speaker from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
One man from the audience had some comments on an agenda item. After three 
minutes of speaking, the mayor began to interrupt him. She continued to disrupt 
his speech and constantly reminded him that he had only a five-minute time 
slot. If I am not mistaken, that five-minute time limit applies only to the 
"public comment" segment of the agenda. In the past meetings, speakers have 
come forward to comment on agenda subjects and taken up to 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Seems to me that our council is more concerned about who the speaker is than 
the time used. This is the fourth time this man has appeared before the 
council, and he has been treated in the same manner. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Diamond Bar, I expect all of our city staff, council members 
and especially our mayor to leave their personal problems at home along with 
their likes and dislikes and perform their service to the people without 
prejudice or malice. 
</P>
<P>
These people were elected by the populace and are expected to represent them, 
not dictate.

SUPERFUND AND VALLEY'S POLLUTION HOT SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After approximately 10 years of studying the San Gabriel Valley's ground-water 
pollution problems, the Environmental Protection Agency will finally begin to 
notify those who possibly are potentially responsible polluters. I suppose we 
should be pleased, but hardly overjoyed, since notification does not signify 
that any money will become available in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the EPA proposed a strategy for cleaning up ground water in the 
Whittier Narrows area so that contamination from the San Gabriel Valley basin 
will be prevented from spreading to the adjoining Central Water Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Your Sept. 10 article insinuated that the Whittier Narrows area is "the most 
heavily contaminated" and that "cleanup work would be financed from companies 
that created the pollution." This is simply not true. The most heavily 
contaminated areas are north of Whittier Narrows, and the cleanup monies cannot 
come from companies that created the pollution because these "phantom" 
polluters have not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
Protection of the Central Water Basin is vital, but the EPA should clean up the 
most polluted plumes in the San Gabriel Valley so that this heavily 
contaminated water will not reach Whittier Narrows. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fact that no production wells in the Central Basin near Whittier 
Narrows have exceeded EPA or state drinking water standards. The EPA even 
projects that the water from these wells is expected to remain useful for at 
least another 30 years. In contrast, at least 25% of the wells in the main San 
Gabriel basin are so heavily contaminated that they have already been shut 
down. Why, as a first step, is EPA proposing to use Superfund money to clean up 
an area that is relatively clean while leaving the most heavily contaminated 
areas untouched?

PRIDE RELIEVED PROP. 2 PASSED TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The PRIDE organization and its legion supporters throughout Pasadena are 
gratified and relieved that the PRIDE-sponsored initiative, Proposition 2, has 
surmounted its first and most critical legal hurdle; a Superior Court just 
refused to grant an injunction that would have temporarily halted the continued 
implementation of Pasadena's new growth-management ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Our faith in the judicial system and the sovereignty of the majority in a 
democratic electoral process has been reaffirmed. Congratulations are in order 
for the city's legal counsel, who steadfastly defended the mandate of the 
people. We are confident that the city will continue to uphold the current law 
without fear, favor or compromise for so long as it prevails. 
</P>
<P>
What this means is that Proposition 2 will eventually receive a full and 
equitable judicial review and will stand or fall on its actual merits rather 
than on the wishful thinking of opponents who lost an election. We have every 
expectation that the sound planning principles expounded in Proposition 2 will 
at that time be fully vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of Proposition 2 is contained in its first two sections: Statement 
of Purpose and Intent, and Findings. These simply state that the residents and 
neighborhoods of Pasadena have had their desires neglected and ignored by the 
city and demand to be fully participatory in future land-use policy and city 
planning efforts. The rest of the initiative merely details the specifics of 
what they feel needs to be done -- for starters. 
</P>
<P>
This is the message of Proposition 2. The people of Pasadena don't want to do 
the precise planning (ballot box planning), but they insist upon being included 
in every step of the planning process (participatory democracy). 
</P>
<P>
This goal PRIDE seeks to attain. All Pasadena voters are by definition 
residents of Pasadena neighborhoods. PRIDE is by definition an advocate of the 
expressed interests of all Pasadena neighborhoods. You can't get any 
broader-based than this!

CHAMPION BRUIN WOMEN SPIKERS WILL BEGIN CONFERENCE SCHEDULE ON FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA women's volleyball team, defending Pacific 10 Conference champion and 
ranked third nationally, will begin its conference schedule when it plays host 
to No. 12 Arizona (7-1, 2-0 in the Pac-10) at 7 p.m. Friday and to Arizona 
State (7-4, 2-0) at 7 p.m. Saturday at the John Wooden Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (5-1 overall) are coming off a victory in last week's Chicago 
Sportmart tournament. UCLA defeated No. 17 Penn State in four games and No. 5 
Illinois in five. 
</P>
<P>
Senior middle blocker Daiva Tomkus was named the tournament's most valuable 
player, and sophomore middle blocker Elaine Youngs was selected on the 
all-tourney team. In the two matches, Tomkus had 32 kills, 13 blocks, 18 digs 
and four service aces, and Youngs had 32 kills, 27 digs, four blocks and five 
aces. Freshman middle blocker Natalie Williams had 34 kills and nine blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine women's volleyball team (4-5 as the week began) will play host 
to Cal State Fullerton at 7:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Waves finished second in the Colorado-Coors Invitational, 
defeating Indiana and South Carolina but losing the championship match to 
Colorado in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Senior outside hitter Tami Seidenberg and sophomore setter Caolyn Hueth were 
named to the all-tournament team. Seidenberg leads the Waves in kills with 129, 
Delson has 114 kills and a team-high hitting percentage of .345, and freshman 
middle blocker Debbie Merandi tops the team with 28 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College women's volleyball team, two-time defending Western 
State Conference champion, will play host to Moorpark in a conference match at 
7 tonight at Corsair Gymnasium. SMC will compete Saturday in the Rancho 
Santiago College Tournament in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs opened the season with non-conference losses to El Camino in three 
games and Citrus in five, but they bounced back to win their WSC opener last 
week, defeating Glendale in three games. 
</P>
<P>
Setter-outside hitter Brigette McDonald and outside hitter Stephanie Tarvyd are 
returning SMC starters, and reserve defensive specialist Diane Renner is also 
back. Freshmen include Julie Foster and Tanja Elliot, both of Palisades High 
School; Heather Perini, and Michelle Bunting, both of Santa Monica High; Stacy 
Pierce of Venice High; Hollis Gans of Yosemite High; Ann-Marie Mandic of St. 
Monica High, and Marvette Williams and Cheryl Howard, both of Westchester High. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 4 UCLA men's soccer team, 6-0 after shutting out St. Mary's, 3-0, last 
week, will play Saturday at the University of New Mexico (3-3) in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
Senior goalkeeper Anton Nistl posted his fourth straight shutout of the season, 
tying the school record of 30 shutouts by Tim Harris. Nistl has a goals against 
average of 0.18. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore midfielder Cobi Jones had a goal and an assist against St. Mary's and 
has now figured in the scoring in all of the Bruins' games. He leads UCLA with 
13 points on four goals and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College football team, ranked 11th in the state, will play 
host to Los Angeles Harbor in a Western State Conference opener at 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday at Corsair Field. 
</P>
<P>
SMC had a bye last week after opening the season with a 33-3 rout of Chaffey. 
In its season opener, Harbor trounced Victor Valley, 27-6. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor is led by running backs Bill Harris and Cameron Pitcher, quarterback 
Glen Bonham and wide receiver Cedric Jenkins. Harris returned a kickoff 101 
yards for an apparent touchdown against Victor Valley, but it was nullified by 
a penalty. The Seahawks are coached by Don Weems, former SMC defensive 
coordinator, who came to Harbor last summer from the University of Nevada Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Corsair linebacker Adonias Lucero was named the WSC defensive player of the 
week after his performance against Glendale. He was in on 22 tackles, recovered 
a fumble and broke up a pass play. 
</P>
<P>
SMC offensive tackle Eduardo Vega was named a preseason All-American by the 
J.C. Grid-Wire, and the wire service called Corsair linebacker Randy Cole a 
player to watch. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine water polo team, 6-2 after finishing fifth in the UC Irvine 
Tournament, will compete this weekend in the Air Force Tournament at Colorado 
Springs. The Waves will play UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara on Saturday and 
West Point and Air Force on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, ranked fifth nationally, were 4-2 at the Irvine tournament. They 
defeated UC San Diego, Cal State Long Beach and UC Davis and upset Stanford, 
which entered the tournament as the nation's top-ranked team. Pepperdine lost 
to California and USC. Cal defeated Irvine in the title game, and USC took 
third by defeating UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Sasa Poljak had 15 goals in the six matches, and sophomore Geoffrey 
Clark added 14. Sophomore goalkeeper Wells Guthrie had a season-high 15 saves 
against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's cross country team, led by freshman Kira Jorgensen, will 
compete Saturday in San Diego State's Aztec Invitational. Jorgensen, of Vista, 
won her first collegiate race two weeks ago, posting a time of 18:23 at the Cal 
State Fullerton Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's and women's cross country teams will run in a 
Western State Conference meet on Friday at Santa Barbara City College. The

PASADENA CHURCH HIT BY THIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thieves made off with four wooden benches from the Church of the Angels in 
Pasadena earlier this week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The benches, valued at $1,500, had been installed as part a restoration that 
began in 1983, said the Rev. Robert Gaestel, vicar of the Episcopal church on 
Avenue 64. 
</P>
<P>
Gaestel said one of the benches, gold with an arch pattern on the backrest, was 
a special loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful," he said. "It was a real work of art. It wasn't just thrown 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The three other benches were a gift of Alice Thomas, a parishioner. 
</P>
<P>
The theft, which happened Sunday night, occurred only a week before the 
church's observance of the 100th anniversary of its consecration.

A FRUSTRATED ANGLER GOES DEEP TO HOOK HIS SURFACE FISH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't a typical three-day tuna fishing trip for Charlie Floven of Long 
Beach, aboard the El Dorado from Long Beach Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day out, steady catches of small albacore were being taken on jig 
stops. Floven failed to land one while trolling. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day, the El Dorado started kelp-hopping stops for yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
At every stop the crew kept busy gaffing albacore catches. Floven kept getting 
hits but was not able to bring a longfin aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Not one to give up, he changed his tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Floven put an 80-pound test line on his rod and tied a treble hook with an 
eight-ounce sinker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try something that is not conventional for surface fishing. I am 
not about to get skunked on this trip," Floven told the crew. 
</P>
<P>
Down toward the bottom, he let his line out with a small whitefish for bait, 
and within minutes was hooked up with a yellowtail. He was following his fish 
and reeling at the same time when suddenly his reel handle failed to turn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one that could be the jackpot and he's not going to get away," said 
Floven. As the rod bent, he started to hand line the heavy fish to the surface 
and the waiting gaff. 
</P>
<P>
It was indeed a jackpot contender, but Floven lost out by one pound to a 
26-pound yellowtail caught by Paul Bentacy of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley Wall of Carson returned Monday from a five-day albacore trip to San 
Benitos Island off Mexico and said it was the most fabulous trip he had ever 
been on. 
</P>
<P>
Wall caught 15 yellowfin tuna and 15 yellowtail and won the jackpot with a 
33-pound yellowtail. He caught three albacore but released the small one. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth annual Dave Freeman Fire Department Burn Foundation derby saw 56 
anglers fishing for cash awards. 
</P>
<P>
First place with a six-pound bonito went to Mark Young, who got a cash award of 
$361. Second spot, worth $217, went to Don Sutton and third, for $73, to Bob 
Olsen. All three winners were from Wilmington Fire House 49. 
</P>
<P>
The big winner of the derby was the burn fund, which received most of the 
proceeds from the derby. 
</P>
<P>
Another International Game Fish Assn. record is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach angler Nick Curcione, fishing with a small fly rod and 
eight-pound test line, caught a 10-pound, 5-ounce skipjack while fishing for 
albacore aboard the Searcher. It has been officially weighed and registered 
with the IGFA. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Friedman of Redondo Beach was also aboard the Searcher and won the 
trip's top lady angler award when she decked nine albacore and seven skipjack. 
</P>
<P>
The Catalina Island Gold Cup Marlin Tournament will take place Monday and 
Tuesday with 110 boats signed up to compete. First place is worth $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects are good as 204 marlin have been weighed in at Avalon so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Dennis McCullough of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Pacifica on a multiday 
trip, caught the whopper of the week with his 55-pound bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tamaray of Hawthorne won the jackpot with his 28-pound yellowtail fishing 
aboard the Blackjack at Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Jess Conti of Long Beach won the jackpot aboard the Victory with his 22-pound 
yellowtail fishing at the rigs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Carson of West Los Angeles, fishing for sand bass aboard the Spitfire, 
hooked a big barracuda; the jackpot fish weighed eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>

BOMB SUSPECTED IN CRASH OF FRENCH PLANE IN AFRICA

<P>
A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard experienced a powerful 
high-altitude explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before crashing in a 
remote desert region of Niger in northern Africa, officials in France said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, intelligence specialists said they believe that the jetliner may 
have been bombed by people seeking to retaliate against France for its recent 
actions in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, France has played an active part in the Lebanon crisis, 
attempting to broker a settlement between Christian and pro-Syrian forces. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the French government sent a naval task force of five warships 
into Lebanese waters as part of what President Francois Mitterrand called a 
"rescue mission" for several thousand French nationals living in the war-torn 
country. But the action was widely perceived as an attempt to provide 
protection and support for Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and his Maronite Christian 
forces against Syrian troops and Muslim militias in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, one intelligence official said Wednesday, the French government has 
realized that its planes were being targeted for some sort of terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
The DC-10 operated by the French airline UTA crashed Tuesday after taking off 
from N'Djamena, Chad, on a flight that originated in Brazzaville, Congo. French 
military helicopter crews who visited the crash site in the desolate reaches of 
the Sahara Desert late Wednesday afternoon found no survivors. Included among 
the presumed dead was the wife of the American ambassador to Chad. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Michel Friess, a spokesman for UTA, said that "the wide surface 
over which the debris of the airplane has been found suggests a high-altitude 
explosion that leads one to think of a criminal attack." 
</P>
<P>
Anonymous callers to the airline office in Paris and to a Western news agency 
in London claimed responsibility for the crash on behalf of the Shiite Muslim 
terrorist organization Islamic Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
The London caller linked the attack to the seizure of a Shiite cleric, Sheik 
Abdel Karim Obeid, by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon on July 28. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he was reading a statement from Islamic Jihad, the London caller 
declared: "We are proud of this action, which was very successful. We would 
like to say the French are warned not to exchange information regarding Sheik 
Obeid with the Israelis no more. We demand the freedom of Sheik Obeid, and 
otherwise we will refresh the memories of the bombings in Paris of '85 and '86. 
Long live the Islamic Republic of Iran." 
</P>
<P>
However, the message made little sense in the context of France's limited role 
in the Obeid matter. 
</P>
<P>
A more likely possibility, speculated terrorist experts and one intelligence 
source in Washington, was a terrorist attack on behalf of pro-Syrian Muslim 
forces in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment Wednesday about the possibility 
of a terrorist attack. "The pieces are widely scattered, so it didn't crash on 
impact," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Air controllers lost contact with UTA Flight 772 less than an hour after it 
took off from N'Djamena. The sudden loss of contact was another explanation 
given by the French airline authorities supporting the theory of a terrorist 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been a very serious problem on board, other than an explosion or 
the sudden disintegration of the airplane," said UTA spokesman Friess, "there 
would have been at least several seconds or minutes for the crew to 
re-establish contact." 
</P>
<P>
UTA officials insisted that the DC-10 was in good working condition, having 
completed 60,000 hours of flying time on 14,700 flights in 16 years of service. 
Since it was formed in 1949, UTA, which specializes in African and Pacific 
routes, had never experienced a crash during a commercial flight. 
</P>
<P>
However, in 1984 a UTA DC-8 aircraft flying the same route was damaged by a 
bomb explosion before takeoff at the N'Djamena airport. Twenty-five people on 
board were injured in that attack, which the Chadian government blamed on 
Libya. Chad-Libyan relations have recently normalized after a 10-year guerrilla 
war. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. government's 
information on Tuesday's disaster was limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't at this time state for a fact that (the plane) was blown up, but it 
does have those appearances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, a RAND Corp. analyst, Bruce Hoffman, said Wednesday he 
believed the attack was probably staged by Shiite Muslim groups concerned that 
France might intervene in Lebanon on behalf of the Maronite Christians led by 
Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that there's a much stronger Middle Eastern context than an 
African context," Hoffman said. "It could be that the Maronites' opponents in 
general were determined to deliver some sort of a knockout blow in Lebanon, and 
(it) was designed as a warning to make the French think twice. 
</P>
<P>
"This would send a pretty clear message to France that they ought to back 
away," Hoffman added. He noted that by the end of August, "all the main Shiite 
players in Lebanon had threatened some sort of retribution against France." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threats by Militants 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 20, the Revolutionary Justice Organization threatened to "strike deep 
into the heart of French territory." Three days later, Hezbollah threatened to 
stage suicide attacks against French targets. On Aug. 25, a previously unknown 
group, the Organization in Defense of the Oppressed, threatened to strike "at 
French interests everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
An Air France flight on Aug. 28 was delayed for more than five hours before 
taking off from Dulles International Airport in Washington when security 
officials received a last-minute bomb threat. According to one well-informed 
intelligence official, both French and American officials took that threat 
seriously and searched all the luggage on the plane before allowing it to 
depart. 
</P>
<P>
While France's willingness to bargain with terrorists for the freedom of 
hostages had in the past created a modus vivendi that appeared to spare the 
country from violent attacks, Hoffman and other analysts suggested that the 
stakes in Lebanon had become too important for those old rules to apply. 
</P>
<P>
"In these people's eyes, we're really talking about Lebanon's future. That 
wrenches the entire struggle in Lebanon onto a higher plateau," Hoffman said. 
"The last battle for Beirut has yet to be fought." 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not the beginning of the end of things there, it's certainly the 
opening of a new wave of conflicts there," agreed another analyst, Jim 
Blackwell of Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst at the center, Robert Kupperman, discounted the possibility 
that a small terrorist group alone could have been responsible for the airborne 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone puts a bomb on the plane, it normally takes the resources of a 
state, at least to set it up," Kupperman said. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Syrian-backed Lebanese forces, Kupperman suggested that Libya and 
Iran also could have been motivated to stage such an attack. 
</P>
<P>
According to intelligence specialists, security at the airport in Chad at which 
the plane stopped is under the control of French officials. However, the French 
do not control airport security in Brazzaville, the city from which the plane 
took off. 
</P>
<P>
The waiting room at Paris' Charles De Gaulle Airport, where the flight was 
scheduled to land, was tense and somber after the plane was first reported 
missing Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Included among the passengers was Bonnie Pugh, wife of the U.S. ambassador to 
Chad, Robert L. Pugh. The State Department said six other Americans were 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Pugh was on her way to the United States for her daughter's wedding, 
according to her sister, Sally Johnson, of Brawley, Calif. The ambassador's 
wife, who was born in Los Angeles in the 1920s and later moved to the Imperial 
Valley, had decided to travel ahead of her husband to help plan the October 
wedding of their 26-year-old daughter Anne in suburban Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger aboard the plane was Chadian Planning Minister Mahamat 
Soumaila, en route to Washington to attend a meeting of the International 
Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers were African. French officials said the victims included 
31 Frenchpassengers.

STUDIES FIND DANGERS IN EXTENDED-WEAR CONTACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Extended-wear contact lenses, introduced nine years ago and now worn by 4 
million Americans, are more than 10 times as likely as other kinds of lenses to 
cause serious eye inflammations that can lead to blindness, according to 
studies published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long suspected that the more hours a day patients wear contact 
lenses, the greater the risk to their eyes, even when the lenses are prescribed 
for extended use. But the New England Journal studies -- sponsored by the major 
manufacturers of contact lenses and conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical 
School and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary -- are the first to document 
the extent of the danger facing those who wear soft contact lenses overnight or 
longer. Those users make up about one-fifth of all contact lens wearers. 
</P>
<P>
"The risk of serious eye damage with any lens is minuscule -- only two-tenths 
of 1%," said Barbara Kelley, director of public affairs for Bausch &amp; Lomb, 
the nation's largest manufacturer of contact lenses and one of the members of 
the Contact Lens Institute, which sponsored the study. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Kelley said, the risk was already perceived as being significant 
enough that Bausch &amp; Lomb began in April telling users of its extended-wear 
lenses to limit wearing time to no more than seven days, after which lenses 
must be removed and cleaned according to manufacturer's directions. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in anticipation of the 
publication of the New England Journal study, advised all contact lens 
manufacturers to inform patients that a previous 30-day limit on wearing time 
should be reduced immediately to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
The studies documented what is considered the worst hazard of contact-lens wear 
-- scratching or abrasion of the cornea that can lead to ulceration, which if 
untreated could cause permanent damage and even blindness. Precisely what 
causes the increased risk of eye damage in patients who wear lenses for long 
periods is not clear, according to the Massachusetts researchers. 
</P>
<P>
One theory is that lenses worn around-the-clock result in hypoxia, or a 
decreased supply of oxygen to the cells of the cornea, which in turn makes the 
cornea more susceptible to abrasion and infection. Another theory is that 
extended wear -- especially if the lenses are not cleaned regularly -- 
increases the opportunity for growth of bacteria, which can endanger the health 
of the eye. 
</P>
<P>
People who put lenses in their eyes and leave them there are being "seduced by 
the convenience . . . and simply don't take care of their lenses," said David 
Krasnow, a Santa Monica optometrist who specializes in fitting contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Massachusetts researchers found in a survey of ophthalmologists in 
five New England states and in a detailed study of 99 patients with corneal 
ulcers, that the overall level of lens care among both patients and control 
subjects was "alarmingly low." 
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated," the editors of the New England Journal said in an editorial, 
"that 50% of those who wear contact lenses care for them unhygienically." They 
don't clean the lenses as prescribed. They allow mold to grow on their cleaning 
equipment. They pop the lenses into their mouths to wet them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for poor compliance with lens-care regimens, especially 
among extended-wear lens users, the editors said, is that there has been too 
little consumer education. Manufacturers have "overemphasized the convenient 
and carefree aspects of using overnight lenses. . . . The trivializing of 
contact lenses led one prominent ophthalmologist to say: 'We are not buying 
panty hose here. This is a medical device.' " 
</P>
<P>
Contact lenses were introduced on the market in the 1940s as hard, 
uncomfortable glass disks about the size of a quarter. Today, contacts are 
about the size of a fingernail. They are made of a variety of plastic products 
and are worn by about 7% of the U.S. population. The safest are thought to be 
those that are made of hard plastic or gas-permeable rigid plastic, but they 
are also the most uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
By far the easiest to wear, although the most complicated to care for, are soft 
lenses, introduced in 1971 and made from a variety of porous, liquid-absorbing 
plastics. Extended-wear soft lenses were introduced in 1981 and disposable 
extended-wear lenses were introduced last year. 
</P>
<P>
Each type of lens has advantages and disadvantages for correcting specific 
vision problems and for preferences and life styles of individual patients, but 
some eye-care specialists have become alarmed enough by the risks associated 
with extended-wear lenses that they have become less eager to prescribe them. 
</P>
<P>
According to the studies, about two in every 10,000 people who wear standard 
hard contacts will get an abrasion on the cornea that leads to an inflamed 
ulcer. For those who wear gas-permeable hard lenses and those who wear soft 
lenses and remove them every night, the risk is about four in 10,000. But for 
those who wear contacts around-the-clock, the risk jumps to 21 in 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the longer patients wore their lenses, the greater 
their risk of problems. But the studies did not distinguish risk rates among 
different brands or types of extended-wear contacts. Some eye-care specialists 
are hopeful that extended-wear lenses that are disposable will have fewer risks 
because they do not require chemicals to clean and do not build up substances 
that may be implicated in serious hazards to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Months before the results of the New England Journal studies were made public, 
ophthalmologists at the Emory University Medical School eye clinic in Atlanta 
said they had stopped dispensing extended-wear contacts, even though they had 
been early enthusiasts for the lenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who wear contact lenses are unaware of the more serious risks 
associated with them," the editors of the New England Journal said. The 
chemicals used to manufacture them and disinfect them can cause allergic 
reactions. Dirt and grit that work their way under the lens cause scratches and 
scarring of the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the most dreaded complication is microbial ulcerative keratitis or 
corneal ulcer, caused by bacterial invasion of the cornea. Left untreated, this 
infection can quickly advance and destroy the corneal stroma, resulting in 
corneal perforation and even loss of vision," the editors said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RISKS LINKED TO SOFT CONTACTS 
</P>
<P>
Contact lenses float on a layer of tears over the cornea, a raised strip of 
transparent tissue covering the colored iris and pupil. The smaller contact 
lens, which covers only part of the cornea, is known as a rigid or hard lens 
and is worn by about one-third of the 20 million Americans who wear contact 
lenses. The larger lens, which covers the cornea plus a small portion of the 
sclera, or white of the eye, is a soft lens. About 11 million Americans wear 
soft lenses that they remove daily. But another 4 million wear soft lenses 
specially designed to be left in the eye for up to seven days at a time -- and 
it is this group that appears to be at greater risk of corneal ulceration. 
Depending on the kind of extended-wear lens, it is either sterilized and put 
back in the eye or replaced with a new disposable lens.

AUTHORIZATION BY BUSH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush ordered more than 1,000 military police, federal marshals and 
FBI agents to St. Croix on Wednesday as the Coast Guard began evacuating 
residents and tourists terrorized by violence on the streets and looting in 
stores and homes shattered by Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
In a wave of lawlessness that spread across the island, eyewitnesses reported 
looting by men and women, children and the elderly, even police and National 
Guardsmen. Armed gangs were reported roaming the streets. Ham radio operators 
said between 300 and 500 inmates had broken out of a hurricane-damaged prison 
and were loose in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists and residents alike pleaded for evacuation. Fifteen tourists were 
quoted as telling the first outsiders to arrive on the island after Hugo's 
devastation: "Please get food! Please get water! Please help us! They're 
looting. We've seen police looting. We've seen National Guard looting. There's 
no law and order here." 
</P>
<P>
Some looters offered poverty as the justification for plundering. Roberto 
Rivera, 22, a store clerk whose wife pushed a cart full of clothes and shoes, 
said: "When starvation comes, people are going to start breaking into people's 
homes. People are afraid of running out of food and are taking stuff from the 
stores even if they don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the looters insisted that shop owners had invited them to help 
themselves, explaining that their insurance would cover the losses. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Bush announced that he had authorized the troops and federal 
police because "conditions of domestic violence and disorder exist in and about 
the Virgin Islands endangering life and property." He said local law 
enforcement could no longer keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush authorized deployment after 
receiving a request for help from Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly. In 
Christiansted, the governor said he had not asked for federal help to restore 
order. But Holland Redfield, a Virgin Islands territorial senator and 
legislative liaison to the White House, said he asked for assistance from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush's authorization called for deployment "as necessary." That 
left the actual dispatching of military police units and federal police 
officers up to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburg and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
At the Justice Department, spokesman David Runkel said Thornburg sent 100 U.S. 
marshals and FBI agents to Christiansted immediately. At the Pentagon, Lt. Col. 
Keith Schneider said that Cheney was preparing to send 1,100 military policemen 
from bases in Texas, Missouri, Louisiana and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed Coast Guardsmen began evacuating tourists and residents from the 
island even before the troops and federal police arrived. Personnel from the 
cutter Bear went ashore during the afternoon and took 40 people back to the 
ship, said John Ware, a petty officer at Coast Guard headquarters in San Juan, 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
"Our shore party basically determined there was a complete breakdown of 
authority," Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Karonis said in Miami. "There's a very high 
indication that innocent people are going to get hurt in an act of violence 
there. We don't know who is in control of the island. There is widespread 
looting. 
</P>
<P>
"There doesn't seem to be a form of control." 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said the evacuees were being taken to Puerto Rico. It said six 
cutters were in the area and that a C-130 cargo plane was ready to help if 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claim Response Slow 
</P>
<P>
Many residents of St. Croix complained bitterly about what they called the slow 
response to their plight from local and U.S. authorities "I can't believe there 
are no U.S. troops or presence here yet. We are a U.S. territory," said Marise 
James, 31, an attorney in Christiansted. "We feel terribly forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, looters sacked stores at Sunny Isle, the island's largest 
shopping center, and at markets and smaller shops through Christiansted. 
</P>
<P>
A few merchants guarded store doors. At one shopping center on the outskirts of 
town, armed men stood watch on the roofs of several large stores. Outside of 
one electronics store, a makeshift plywood sign read: "Looters will be shot on 
sight." 
</P>
<P>
But the looters had free access to most stores. They carried bags and boxes, 
wheeled carts full of food, clothes and household items. Some even packed 
furniture onto the beds of pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The mood among the looters was casual, almost jovial, and the scene had the 
appearance of a weekend flea market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fail to Report 
</P>
<P>
Police and National Guardsmen stationed on the island were hardly visible 
outside the downtown area. Many of them, coping with their own property losses, 
had not yet reported for duty, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although some residents said they had personally seen National Guardsmen 
packing looted goods into their trucks, government officials denied that this 
happened. They said guardsmen may have been retrieving stolen goods or 
delivering food to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
For Paul Gelep, a retired jeweler from Fitchburg, Mass., his St. Croix 
"shangri-la" had turned into a "living hell." 
</P>
<P>
Gelep, who moved to Christiansted in February, survived the terror of Hurricane 
Hugo's devastating assault -- but now lives in fear of looters. 
</P>
<P>
He and his neighbors began taking turns standing armed guard at their large 
trailer home park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Completely Isolated' 
</P>
<P>
"We're completely isolated here," said Gelep, sitting in the kitchen of his 
trailer, one of the few Hugo left standing. "We do have some weapons. Our backs 
are up against the wall. If it's necessary, we'll use them." 
</P>
<P>
Tourists sat on the porch of the King Christian Hotel, protected by hotel 
employees carrying shotguns. "It was horrendous," said Rose Hertzog of 
Northampton, Pa. "I thought we were going to die." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to pleading poverty, looters argued that, once food supplies were 
exhausted, they would not be able to feed their families. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody else is doing it, why shouldn't we?" said one young housewife. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Mitchell stood watch at his small grocery store and called the situation 
"near anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who claimed good rapport with his customers and neighbors, said the 
looters had been "very respectful -- while I'm here." The problem, he said, is 
when he went away. "I just stay here 'till I fall, and then I go home to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"We need federal troops to reassure the community that the government is in 
place and doing its best to get a handle on a very unfortunate situation," 
Mitchell said. "We don't have the manpower to do it alone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Armed Mobs Reported 
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching Washington said machete-armed mobs had taken to streets on St. 
Croix -- and that looters included even small children and old women. 
</P>
<P>
Amateur radio reports relayed from the island said that prisoners who had 
escaped its hurricane-damaged prison were terrorizing residents. Gunshots were 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
Frank A. Bracken, undersecretary of Interior, ordered to go to the Virgin 
Islands on Tuesday, confirmed that the prison had been damaged and that inmates 
had gotten loose. He told of a general feeling of fear. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken told his boss, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., that the federal 
government needed to establish security before aiding post-hurricane cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"He said there had been a lot of devastation, that every store he had seen on 
the island appeared to have been looted, and that he was very concerned about 
security," said Interior spokesman Steve Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard spokesman said: "Our understanding is that there has been a 
breakdown in law and order. . . . The situation is serious. Looting and civil 
disturbances continue." 
</P>
<P>
Storm devastation on St. Croix was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the homes on the island were badly damaged or destroyed. Dozens of 
small boats littered parking lots, where they had been towed. Others rested 
awkwardly against the sides of buildings. At a small sea-plane landing site 
near the bay, several aircraft lay tumbled over on their sides. 
</P>
<P>
Roads throughout the island remained littered with fallen trees and broken 
power poles and electrical lines. Three days after Hugo's ravaging passage, St. 
Croix was still without water or lights or telephones. 
</P>
<P>
It remained virtually cut off from the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Farrelly, who stopped briefly to talk to a small group of reporters 
visiting the island by helicopter, said up to 70% of its structures were 
destroyed. He said it will take four weeks to restore water service and 
electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
Farrelly said he would maintain an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
In his request for federal help, Redfield, the Virgin Islands territorial 
senator, said he had described the scene on St. Croix as the devastation left 
by "an atom bomb" -- but that the first priority for assistance was 
"reestablishing law and order." 
</P>
<P>
"If it continues this way, panic will set in and it will get worse," Redfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the evacuation, the Coast Guard had been involved in hurricane relief. 
At the same time that he authorized troop deployment, Bush declared the Virgin 
Islands a disaster area. The declaration made more hurricane relief available, 
along with federal disaster assistance. A similar declaration was expected for 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
In Puerto Rico, at the north end of Hugo's arc of destruction, the hurricane 
was being called the territory's worst natural disaster in half a century. Gov. 
Rafael Hernandez Colon described it as a "tragedy of the greatest proportions" 
and said he would ask President Bush to declare the island a disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House officials said Bush already had ordered the Pentagon 
to send troops and equipment to restore electricity and water. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon sent a C-141 jet transport with portable generators and 
communications gear and another with 17 tons of additional equipment and 16 
officials from the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The Coast Guard 
flew an HC-130 cargo plane between San Juan and the offshore island of Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
It carried emergency supplies to the island. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troops Patrol Capital 
</P>
<P>
National Guard troops patrolled the capital of San Juan to prevent plundering. 
Thirty persons reportedly were arrested for looting, but officials said the 
police were able to bring the situation under quick control. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of fresh water posed a serious problem for homes, hotels, hospitals and 
emergency shelters. Banks and supermarkets in San Juan were open on a limited 
basis, but retail stores remained closed, their windows cracked, taped or 
boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
All across San Juan, people were selling water, milk, juice and food from the 
back of trucks. Everywhere, hot, thirsty residents searched for water, carrying 
large plastic water jugs. Streets were hopelessly gridlocked. Only a handful of 
stoplights worked, and traffic police were few. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few gasoline stations had emergency power to operate their pumps, and 
lines formed hundreds of cars long. 
</P>
<P>
At Isla Verde commuter airport, charter flights and Coast Guard aid missions 
resumed, taxiing around dozens of small airplanes tossed about the field. 
Damage there was estimated at $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Munoz Marin International Airport reopened to flights to and from the 
United States, but departures and landings were limited to daylight hours. The 
main terminal was operating on emergency power and few lights. 
</P>
<P>
Airline officials were unable to communicate with air fields in the Virgin 
Islands and at other Caribbean destinations.

RAMIREZ GUILTY ON ALL NIGHT STALKER MURDER CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Ramirez, whose murderous crime rampage four years ago terrorized 
Southern California and baffled police for months, was found guilty Wednesday 
of all 43 Night Stalker crimes, including 13 murders. The verdict raises the 
possibility of a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Before the verdicts were read, the sullen, 29-year-old defendant asked for, and 
was granted, permission to leave the packed courtroom, which included several 
relatives of his murder victims. He heard the verdicts -- a virtual clean sweep 
for the prosecution -- through a speaker in a holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court jury of seven women and five men, which 
deliberated for 22 days, next must decide whether to condemn the 
devil-worshiping drifter from El Paso to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin 
or order him imprisoned for life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
As he was taken from the courthouse, Ramirez flashed a two-finger "devil sign" 
to photographers. Asked what he thought about the verdicts, he issued a 
one-word comment: "Evil." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel V. Hernandez, Ramirez's chief counsel, said "Richard wasn't surprised" 
by the verdicts. Ramirez, he said, has felt for several weeks now that the jury 
could not be fair or objective in its deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," added Ray G. Clark, Hernandez's co-counsel. "I felt that we 
had raised a reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
After the court adjourned, Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. P. Philip Halpin 
commented: "Thank God this phase is over." 
</P>
<P>
Co-prosecutor Alan S. Yochelson said he would begin immediately calling the 
relatives of Ramirez's victims to inform them of the verdicts. "I hope they can 
find some relief in that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the verdicts, Halpin and Yochelson got everything they asked for, except for 
one murder count, in which the jury returned a guilty verdict of second-degree 
rather than first-degree murder. That involved the March 17, 1985, murder of 
Tsai-Lian Victoria Yu, who was shot to death in her car on Alhambra Avenue in 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
But Halpin and Yochelson called that determination "amazingly sophisticated" 
because, they said, the jurors had been smart enough to determine that the 
murder had occurred without premeditation or deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows they were paying very close attention to both the evidence and the 
jury instructions," Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Word to Relatives 
</P>
<P>
After court was adjourned, the prosecutors advised the relatives of Ramirez's 
victims who were on hand to refrain from commenting to the news media, since 
the penalty phase still lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But two of them, Ellen Francis and Judith Arnold, the daughters of Maxon and 
Lela Kneiding, who lived in Glendale, said they intended to visit their 
parents' grave sites. The women had struggled visibly to choke back tears as 
Judge Michael A. Tynan read the guilty verdicts for the murders of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the jury returned with 19 "special circumstances," such as the 
commission or attempted commission of a burglary in addition to a murder. Each 
such "special circumstance" makes Ramirez subject to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
It took court clerk Josephine Williams and Tynan about 45 minutes to read the 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called penalty phase of the trial is to begin Wednesday morning. 
Ramirez's lawyers are expected to start calling witnesses whose testimony is 
intended to persuade jurors to spare Ramirez's life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebuttal Weighed 
</P>
<P>
Halpin said he does not intend to call prosecution witnesses during this phase, 
except perhaps as rebuttal witnesses after the defense case is over. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Night Stalker crimes were committed during pre-dawn residential 
burglaries throughout Los Angeles County and were marked by cold-blooded 
murders, savage beatings, mutilations and sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
The crimes were especially chilling because they seemed so indiscriminate. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were middle-class men and women who lived peacefully in neatly 
tended houses and condominiums and had simply gone to bed with a window or door 
unsecured on a warm, benign California night. 
</P>
<P>
Among Ramirez's victims were a traffic supervisor, an accountant, a lawyer, a 
student, a pizzeria owner, a parking lot attendant, an auto mechanic. Some were 
grandparents. One was a church deacon. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of random and brutal slayings generated widespread fear throughout 
Southern California once police disclosed the existence of a wanton serial 
killer on Aug. 8, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of guns, ammunition, locks and window bars rose sharply all over the 
county. In the weeks leading up to Aug. 31, the day Ramirez was caught by 
citizens in East Los Angeles, employees of gun shops and home-security stores 
often arrived for work in the morning to find customers waiting at their doors. 
</P>
<P>
Even police officers were spooked by the killings. One senior member of the 
region-wide police Night Stalker task force became so concerned that he moved 
his family out of their San Gabriel Valley house during the manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
Various government agencies eventually offered about $80,000 in reward money 
for information leading to the killer's arrest and conviction. Nearly 20 claims 
already have been filed and now can be processed. 
</P>
<P>
All but one attack occurred between mid-March and early August of 1985. Several 
of them took place within hours and blocks of one another. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, many weeks passed before investigators realized that the lack of a 
pattern was one of Ramirez's trademarks. His modus operandi did not fit neatly 
into the traditional categories that police had come to associate with serial 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the killings continued, however, investigators gradually began to 
recognize the Night Stalker's various "signatures" -- distinctive and gaping 
stab and slash wounds to the throat or body; the familiar language that Ramirez 
used in demanding loot; his use of ligatures and restraints, including 
handcuffs and thumb cuffs; and unusual Avia shoe prints at many of the crime 
scenes, including a bloody print on a murder victim's face. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez often severed the telephone wires after gaining entry. 
</P>
<P>
In nearly all the attacks, he quickly dispatched any adult males with a gunshot 
to the head. Then he ransacked the homes and assaulted the women, sometimes in 
the same room where their husbands lay dead. A Northridge man who survived a 
gunshot still carries Ramirez's bullet in his head. 
</P>
<P>
Another Ramirez trademark was the pentagram, which first appeared in the remote 
Monrovia home of Mabel Bell and Florence Lang, drawn on a bedroom wall and on 
the thigh of one of the women. In a Sun Valley attack, he repeatedly ordered a 
woman to "swear upon Satan" as he looted her home and raped and sodomized her 
after killing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
The pentagrams -- inverted, five-pointed stars inside circles, associated with 
devil worship -- also were found later on the dashboard of a car driven by 
Ramirez and on his arm. In jail, he drew a pentagram on the cell floor, 
apparently in his own blood. Ramirez also flashed a pentagram drawn on his palm 
once in open court, yelling, "Hail Satan!" 
</P>
<P>
The Avia tennis shoes were never found. But prosecutors linked the shoe prints 
to Ramirez by introducing evidence from a Monrovia burglary on May 9, 1985, in 
which police identified not only the shoe prints but also a Ramirez palm print 
-- on the kitchen counter beneath an open window. Ramirez was not charged in 
that incident. 
</P>
<P>
In all, four handguns were used in the Night Stalker crimes, but only one was 
recovered. However, firearms tests showed that several unused bullets in a bag 
that Ramirez had left at the downtown Greyhound bus depot once had been loaded 
into the gun that was used in Night Stalker attacks in Northridge and Diamond 
Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, about 375 pieces of jewelry and other personal property taken from 
eight of the crime scenes were recovered and linked to Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the burglaries and murders, Ramirez also is suspected of 
kidnaping and sexually assaulting as many as a dozen children, some as young as 
6, although he was never charged with those crimes, according to Sgt. Frank 
Salerno, the Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide detective who directed the 
Night Stalker task force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14th Victim? 
</P>
<P>
Officials also believe that Ramirez murdered a 14th person in Los Angeles 
County: Patti Higgins, a 32-year-old special education teacher who was found in 
her Arcadia apartment on June 27, 1985, with her throat slashed. That charge 
was dropped before trial because of lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
As for the 43 felony counts on which Ramirez was tried, the outcome never 
seemed in much doubt, given the wealth of direct and circumstantial evidence 
against Ramirez, which also included self-incriminating statements he made 
after arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In all, eight eyewitnesses -- including six surviving women -- either 
identified Ramirez as their assailant or placed him at a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection began on July 21, 1988, nearly three years after Ramirez's 
arrest. The case went to the jury last July 26, after more than 165 witnesses 
had testified and 658 exhibits were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was full of twists and turns and tragedy of its own. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 14, after 12 1/2 days of deliberations, one of the jurors, Phyllis Y. 
Singletary, was found murdered in her Carson apartment, the victim of a 
domestic quarrel with her boyfriend, James C. Melton. Melton committed suicide 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Singletary's murder traumatized many of the remaining jurors and eight 
alternates, raising questions as to whether they would be emotionally capable 
of carrying on. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Tynan gave jurors a day off and ordered deliberations to begin anew 
after a disconsolate alternate was named to take Singletary's place. 
</P>
<P>
That was the second false start in jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, one of the jurors fell asleep twice during the second week of 
deliberations, prompting Tynan on Aug. 11 to dismiss him and replace him with 
another alternate. It was the following Monday morning that Singletary was 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Arturo Hernandez, Ramirez's initial defense lawyers, frustrated 
Judge Tynan and prosecutor Halpin with maneuvers that repeatedly delayed the 
proceedings. Halfway through the trial, Tynan appointed the third lawyer, 
Clark, to assist the team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted No Defense 
</P>
<P>
The 14-month trial would have ended much sooner had Ramirez's lawyers taken 
their client's advice. 
</P>
<P>
After the prosecution rested its case, Ramirez did not want to mount a defense. 
But his lawyers prevailed, ultimately calling 38 witnesses on Ramirez's behalf 
over the course of about five weeks in an attempt to imbue jurors with a 
reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years of court proceedings in the case, Ramirez's courtroom 
behavior often has been unpredictable. He once called a witness a liar. Another 
time he called the judge several expletives. On another occasion, he used an 
object to reflect ceiling light into the face of a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at other times, the shaggy-haired defendant, with his ever-present black 
sunglasses, has studiously followed the testimony, taking notes and conferring 
with members of his defense team. His feet remained shackled throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was examined in 1985 by a court-appointed psychologist, who found him 
to be "borderline competent" after a 10- to 15-minute discussion that was 
abruptly terminated by Ramirez. "I am sane," Ramirez said at one pretrial 
hearing in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors presented the 43 felony charges to jurors as 15 
separate "incidents," mostly in chronological order, buttressed by charts and 
maps as well as gruesome color photographs of the crime scenes and victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces More Charges 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez still faces separate felony charges, including murder and attempted 
murder, in Orange County and in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
His identity became known after authorities lifted a partial fingerprint from a 
stolen car that was linked to Ramirez's final attack, in Mission Viejo on Aug. 
25, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Working manually -- and not with a laser and a state-of-the-art computer as 
previously reported -- experts matched that print with those taken of Ramirez 
after his arrest in Los Angeles several years earlier on a misdemeanor traffic 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
Once Ramirez's identity became known, police issued an all-points bulletin for 
his arrest, accompanied by a mug shot. The next morning, Aug. 31, 1985, he was 
captured in East Los Angeles shortly after he had returned to Los Angeles from 
Arizona, where he was visiting a brother. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, Ramirez nearly eluded the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of his arrest, about half a dozen Los Angeles undercover police 
officers -- armed with Ramirez's photograph -- had staked out the downtown 
Greyhound bus depot, expecting the suspect to board a bus out of town. 
</P>
<P>
But Ramirez managed to slip through the depot undetected, apparently because 
the officers had been focusing on departing passengers rather than those 
arriving in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After Ramirez was arrested and fingerprinted, Los Angeles police also linked 
him to the murder of a 79-year-old Glassell Park woman in June of 1984 by 
identifying two of his fingerprints -- previously unidentified -- on a window 
screen that had been removed to gain entry to the woman's ground-floor 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was allowed to leave the courtroom before the verdicts were read 
despite prosecution objections. Tynan excused Ramirez, saying he feared that 
the defendant would disrupt the proceedings.

KEY PLAYERS IN STALKER TRIAL 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL A. TYNAN, 52 -- Superior Court judge since 1984. Somewhat impatient by 
nature, he has managed the case with forebearance and humor, several times 
making rulings that have avoided mistrials. 
</P>
<P>
P. PHILIP HALPIN, 52 -- The no-nonsense, career prosecutor has clashed 
repeatedly with opposing counsel while working overtime to correct or avoid 
defense mistakes in hopes of avoiding appellate reversal. 
</P>
<P>
ALAN S. YOCHELSON, 34 -- He joined district attorney's office eight years ago. 
Was ecstatic when assigned as the Night Stalker co-prosecutor. Friendly, 
easy-going. He handled blood and scientific evidence skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
DANIEL V. HERNANDEZ, 44 -- A late-comer to the legal profession, enrolling in 
law school at age 33. Has struggled mightily through his first death-penalty 
case. Often chided by Tynan for shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
RAY G. CLARK, 58 -- A folksy, plain-speaking lawyer. Appointed by Tynan in 
mid-trial to assist Hernandez. A quick study, but he never seemed to fully 
grasp the enormous amount of details and evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
FRANK SALERNO, 50 -- Sheriff's Department homicide detective. Avid outdoorsman. 
Led the Night Stalker task force. Has attended trial religiously. One Night 
Stalker incident occurred near his home.

A former executive of Wedtech Corp. testified at Rep. Robert Garcia's extortion 
trial in New York that the governor of Puerto Rico assured the congressman that 
the South Bronx company would get lucrative ferryboat contracts. The testimony 
of Mario Moreno, Wedtech's former chief financial officer, appeared to buttress 
the government's argument that Garcia, a Democrat from New York, exploited his 
political influence to help Wedtech in return for bribes. Moreno said he, 
Garcia and Wedtech founder John Mariotta met in San Juan with Puerto Rico Gov. 
Rafael Hernandez Colon on Sept. 23, 1985, to discuss the contract. After Garcia 
and the governor emerged from a private meeting, Moreno testified, the 
congressman said: "The governor is going to take care of this. . . ."

A former nursing home aide was found guilty on charges that she smothered five 
incapacitated patients in a pact with her lesbian lover. A jury in Grand 
Rapids, Mich., deliberated five hours before finding Gwendolyn Graham guilty on 
five counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder 
in the 1987 deaths of patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home. Graham, 26, faces 
mandatory life imprisonment without parole. The case rested largely on 
testimony by Catherine Wood, who said the two had formed a pact to suffocate 
patients so they would be bound to each other. Wood, who pleaded guilty to 
second-degree murder, faces up to life in prison when she is sentenced.

A federal judge in Savannah, Ga., sentenced convicted spy Huseyin Yildirim to 
life in prison for turning over U.S. military secrets to agents for Eastern 
Bloc governments. Yildirim, 61, a Turkish national, was convicted July 21 on 
charges of conspiring to commit espionage against the United States and of 
acting as a courier for convicted spy and former Army Warrant Officer James W. 
Hall III. Yildirim, who did not testify at his trial, told U.S. District Judge 
B. Avant Edenfield that he was innocent and was in fact a double agent for the 
United States.

TOXINS FORCE SHELLFISH BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The worst toxic contamination since 1980 has forced a quarantine of 
non-commercial harvesting of shellfish on the coastline of Del Norte, Humboldt 
and Mendocino counties. State Health Director Kenneth Kizer said mussel samples 
from the area had potentially life-threatening levels of the toxin that causes 
paralytic shellfish poisoning. He said toxin levels were the highest since 
paralytic shellfish poisoning was blamed for two deaths in 1980. The quarantine 
applies to clams, razor clams, cockles, scallops and other bivalve mollusks. 
Paralytic shellfish poisoning affects the nervous system after consumption of 
mussels and other shellfish that have fed on certain highly toxic marine 
organisms. Commercial harvesting is unaffected by the quarantine since there is 
a regulatory program to prevent shellfish with high levels of PSP toxin from 
reaching the market, Kizer said.

Syria and Iran said they have swung their weight behind an Arab plan to bring 
peace to Lebanon. "The Syrian and Iranian sides expressed support for efforts 
to achieve a cease-fire in Lebanon, lift blockades, open Beirut airport, form a 
committee to supervise the cease-fire and monitor ships to prevent the entry of 
arms," said a joint statement, which reflected the main points of a peace plan 
backed by an Arab League committee trying to end Lebanon's 14-year civil war. 
Syria is the main foreign power broker in Lebanon; Iran took part in a recent 
meeting that announced the formation of an alliance of Muslim and leftist 
groups. Those forces have been fighting troops of Christian army chief Michel 
Aoun since March.

Dessert recipes collected for 18 years by acclaimed pastry chef Lindsey Shere 
were stolen by a burglar, who slipped into Shere's Berkeley home and made off 
with her purse containing a notebook. The book included recipes for ice creams, 
sorbets, brioches and the secret of green walnut liqueur, a feature of Shere's 
Chez Panisse Restaurant. "I feel a little numb," Shere said, in offering an 
unspecified reward for return of the recipes with no questions asked.

STRETCH OF THE STANISLAUS PRIZED BY RAFTERS HAS REAPPEARED AT BOTTOM OF 
SHRINKING RESERVOIR

STANISLAUS, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hard rain pelted the river and the ghost forest of drowned oaks and sugar pines 
along the banks, but Jim Foust was too delighted to be cold. He was confirming 
the rumor that has swept like a good joke through California's river rafting 
fraternity -- after 10 years at the bottom of a lake, the famous rapids of the 
Stanislaus River canyon are runnable again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really kind of amazing," Foust said, paddling down the Stanislaus as he 
had dozens of times in the 1970s. "The trees are all dead, of course, but I 
recognize those rocks. And the rapids are just about how I remember them." 
</P>
<P>
The Stanislaus was one of the special places to California environmentalists, 
celebrated for its steep limestone cliffs, Indian caves and soaring red-tailed 
hawks as well as the mild but thrilling rapids. Hearts broke when man sunk the 
Stanislaus beneath New Melones Reservoir to store irrigation water for Central 
Valley growers. 
</P>
<P>
But nature has proven to be the greater force, at least for now. Drought has 
dropped the lake nearly 200 feet, exposing four miles of rapids where many 
California rafters -- including former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. -- got their 
first taste of white water, and where an epic and emotional environmental 
battle was fought a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanislaus was the first popular stretch of white water for rafting, an 
easy drive from the Mother Lode towns of Sonora and Columbia. Plans to dam the 
canyon set off several years of protests and brought about the creation of 
Friends of the River, an environmental lobbying group that has fought off every 
dam project that would inundate white water since New Melones. 
</P>
<P>
Driving the canyon rim on a dirt road turned muddy by two days of chilling 
rain, Foust's excitement grew with every new river view. "There's Widowmaker 
(rapid), I think," Foust said to Gate Briseno, another veteran of the old 
river. 
</P>
<P>
The shrinking lake has left a bathtub ring of denuded rock high on the canyon 
cliffs. Silt has piled six feet deep along the banks of the resurgent river, 
now bare of the thick brush and trees Foust recalls from 10 years ago. Shrubs 
and poison oak rooting in the newly exposed flats are the only greenery. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing thermal underwear and a wet suit, Foust put his raft into the river 
just below the bridge at Camp Nine Road. His party included Rich Sasser, a 
Modesto firefighter and part-time river guide making his first run down this 
piece of the Stanislaus. "Never thought I'd get to run this part," Sasser said. 
</P>
<P>
The raft drifted past a grazing cow, but there were few birds and no other 
animal life visible. Foust, owner of Sunshine Outdoor Center 30 miles 
downstream in Knights Ferry, stopped occasionally to clamber over rocks and 
check out side canyons to refresh his memory for landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
He pronounced about four miles of rapids to be as good as ever. The silt had 
washed out of most of the rock groins and cascades during the summer. "This 
water is running pretty clean, even with the rain," Foust said. 
</P>
<P>
Downstream from Razorback rapid, the river widens and turns so heavily silted 
that the raft scraped on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
About a mile farther downstream the silt bottom drops away and the flowing 
water turns to glass, signaling the upper bounds of the reservoir. Rapids that 
were lower in the canyon -- Chicken Falls, Wino's Swim, Chinese Dogleg -- 
remain inundated. The old Parrotts Ferry bridge where rafters used to haul out, 
still three miles downriver, is deep underwater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chained to a Rock 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Foust was working the other side of the Stanislaus controversy. 
He was a river ranger for the Army Corps of Engineers sent out to find Mark 
DuBois, an activist who had chained himself to a rock at the water line 
somewhere in the canyon in an attempt to block filling of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
DuBois -- then director of Friends of the River -- was visited by accomplices 
and reporters, but was never discovered by Foust and other searchers. He came 
out of the canyon voluntarily, but not before Gov. Brown negotiated an 
agreement with the Corps of Engineers to delay the filling. 
</P>
<P>
Word that the Stanislaus rapids are back has spread fast to old river hands, 
including DuBois, who said that travel plans will prevent him from rafting the 
canyon for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I very much want to go up there," DuBois said this week in San Francisco, 
where he is helping organize an Earth Day celebration for next April. "The 
Stanislaus touched people's hearts like few places have. It was accessible, but 
because you had these 1,000-foot cliffs around you, you felt as if you were 100 
miles away from civilization. There is no other limestone canyon on the West 
Coast that compares to it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bittersweet Experience 
</P>
<P>
DuBois said he noticed this spring that the lake was dropping fast, and 
suspected that the rapids might reappear. But rafters who tried the canyon in 
the spring said the water and silt were still too high for the rapids to show. 
</P>
<P>
Original Friends of the River activists have been rafting the Stanislaus for 
the last month since discovering that it runs again. Some find it a bittersweet 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend called me up and said, 'Guess what I just did?' " said Linda Cloud of 
Sacramento. She arranged to go down the canyon soon after. 
</P>
<P>
"I just found it inspiring. I kept thinking to myself, I can't believe I'm 
here," Cloud said. "But there is a lot of it that is real ugly. For a lot of 
people it's real painful to go back." 
</P>
<P>
Where the river stops dropping and flattens into the lake, rafts drift past the 
upper branches of old cottonwoods and pines poking above the surface. Upstream 
Cloud spotted grass and wildflowers growing on the higher banks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Surprise 
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised at how quickly it can rejuvenate," she said. "From what 
friends told me, the river had cleaned out the silt for another mile between 
July and August." 
</P>
<P>
When DuBois chained himself to the rock, the lake surface was at 803 feet above 
sea level. It has filled as high as 1,087 feet, and stands now at 891 feet, "as 
low as we've been since the early 1980s when we filled the dam," said Keith 
Davis, park manager at New Melones for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
The lake will continue falling until October or November unless unexpected 
heavy rains begin refilling it, Davis said, but it likely will not rise to its 
normal level until the spring snow runoff.

CONGRESSMEN URGE USE OF MILITIA IN BORDER DRUG WAR 
</P>

Warning that President Bush has left the state ill-equipped to wage a war on 
drugs, a group of California congressmen Wednesday urged Gov. George Deukmejian 
to order full-time deployment of the National Guard along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to seek federal assistance for the unprecedented effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the Bush Administration demonstrates its commitment to provide 
California with the resources we need . . . Californians will have to fight the 
drug war on our own," said the plan's principal author, Rep. Mel Levine 
(D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Join U.S. Agents 
</P>
<P>
The plan would for the first time enlist hundreds of uniformed guardsmen as 
permanent participants in the anti-drug effort. They would join federal agents 
in searching suspicious cargo and surveying sensitive border crossings by land 
and air. 
</P>
<P>
The Guard patrol program would be designed to emulate Operation Border Ranger 
II, a monthlong crackdown that resulted in hundreds of arrests and a number of 
major drug busts last spring before being halted when a special federal subsidy 
ran out. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan's sponsors, the Los Angeles-area's six Democratic congressmen, 
contend that the Bush Administration's refusal to provide the drug-ridden 
region with emergency anti-narcotics assistance leaves the state with no choice 
but to send out the Guard. 
</P>
<P>
To help pay for the effort, Levine and the other congressmen said they will 
introduce legislation guaranteeing at least $10 million in Defense Department 
funding for National Guard operations in California this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Levine urged Deukmejian to deploy the Guard even before the funding goes 
through, saying: "If we want to recapture our state from drug dealers, we must 
do it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Deukmejian told reporters that he had not yet seen the 
Democratic proposal and could not comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
But the second-ranking officer for the Army National Guard, Gen. William J. 
Jefferds, said the service would object to any plan that requires anti-drug 
operations to be conducted on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Once it's permanent, you're compromised in your effort and the traffickers 
will shift their operations elsewhere," said Jefferds, the deputy adjutant 
general. By deploying guardsmen instead on a "surging" basis, the Guard could 
maintain the element of surprise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the governor and the general made clear, however, that they would favor a 
stepped-up National Guard role in anti-drug operations within the state. 
Indeed, the Guard has already asked the Pentagon for $10.5 million in 
assistance to underwrite proposed operations next year, they said. 
</P>
<P>
That would mark more than a tenfold increase over the $990,000 in assistance 
dispatched to the state earlier this year as part of a landmark effort to 
integrate National Guard forces in drug-enforcement efforts across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of that money was spent in the Border Ranger II crackdown, in which 
about 600 troops joined Customs Service and Drug Enforcement Administration 
agents in inspecting shipments at major entry points and in surveying traffic 
along suspected smuggling routes. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials declared the operation "successful on every measure," noting 
that it contributed to almost 500 drug-related arrests and the seizure of 
nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine and more than 2,000 pounds of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
That success contrasted sharply with the experience of the original Operation 
Border Ranger, which was canceled in 1988 after one of its first helicopter 
patrols crashed, killing five sheriff's deputies and three guardsmen. 
</P>
<P>
In unveiling his proposal to elevate the anti-drug operation to permanent 
status, Levine acknowledged its potential danger. But he contended that the 
"benefits in terms of human lives and physical safety in our communities" would 
far outweigh "the risks in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Although a number of California Republicans have been outspoken advocates of an 
active National Guard role in the drug fight, none were asked to endorse the 
Democratic proposal. One GOP congressmen, Rep. Duncan L. Hunter of Coronado, 
said: "I'm glad they finally got on board." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal appeared designed in large part to renew critical attention on the 
Bush Administration's refusal so far to declare Los Angeles a "high-intensity 
drug-trafficking area," a designation that would enable the city to qualify for 
emergency federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
While the Administration already has given such status to Washington, D.C., it 
angered many California officials by deciding to wait until February before 
deciding which other cities would be put in the special category. 
</P>
<P>
In denouncing that decision Wednesday, the Democrats argued that the Mexican 
border area and Los Angeles have emerged as key points for the import, 
distribution, manufacturing of illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Any money sent to California," said Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), "is 
part of the fight against the national drug problem." 
</P>
<P>
Other co-sponsors of the legislation are Democratic Reps. Howard L. Berman of 
Panorama City, Matthew G. Martinez of Monterey Park, Esteban E. Torres of La 
Puente and Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles.

QUAYLE STRESSES N. KOREA MILITARY THREAT 
</P>

Praising South Korea's "political transformation and movement toward 
democracy," Vice President Dan Quayle emphasized the military threat posed by 
North Korea and soft-pedaled concerns over continuing human rights violations 
in the south as he met Wednesday with government and opposition party 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The North Korean military establishment is larger than ever," Quayle told 
members of the Korean Newspaper Editors Assn. in a speech. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said, Moscow in the recent has strengthened North Korea by 
sending it advanced aircraft. The rationale for the continued presence of U.S. 
troops here, he said, "is as strong as ever." 
</P>
<P>
South Korea was the first stop on a four-nation tour of Asia that will also 
take Quayle to Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia before he returns to 
Washington next week. Before leaving today for Tokyo, Quayle plans to visit the 
demilitarized zone between the two Koreas to review U.S. and South Korean 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's tone here reflected the Bush Administration's policy of avoiding 
public confrontation with other nations over human rights issues as well as his 
own deep suspicion of Soviet military intentions. Although U.S. Embassy 
officials have expressed private concern over the human rights situation here, 
the Administration has carefully avoided any public criticism of President Roh 
Tae Woo and his government. 
</P>
<P>
Roh, Quayle said in his speech, has "successfully ushered in democratic 
reforms" and shown "moderation in the face of radical violence that seems 
designed to provoke overreaction." 
</P>
<P>
Korean opposition leaders have questioned that moderation, charging that in 
recent months Roh's government has turned toward a more repressive course. They 
cite figures made public Tuesday by a committee of the Korean National Assembly 
that show a sharp increase in arrests under the country's strict National 
Security Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indicted Opposition Leader 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government last month indicted Kim Dae Jung, the nation's 
best-known opposition figure. The indictment, which Kim has vehemently 
denounced, charges that he failed to report an opposition legislator's trip to 
North Korea and received money from the legislator that the traveler had 
received from North Korean agents. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle sidestepped that issue in meetings with Roh, Kim and other Korean 
leaders. U.S. officials said that Roh assured Quayle that he "would not turn 
back" toward the repressive policies of past South Korean governments. 
</P>
<P>
"The vice president was happy about that," spokesman David Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
Although complaints of a government crackdown have been a major part of the 
opposition's political program, neither Kim Dae Jung nor Kim Young Sam, the 
other main opposition leader, raised the issue directly during their meeting 
with Quayle at the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae Jung criticized past U.S. policies, saying that in the past the United 
States "put security too much ahead of Korea's democratization," according to a 
Korean official who briefed reporters after the meeting. The U.S. government 
had alienated many South Koreans by its "support for dictatorial regimes of the 
past," the official quoted Kim as saying. 
</P>
<P>
But both Kims emphasized their support for the presence of 43,000 U.S. troops 
here. Any move to reduce the U.S. force at this point would be "unproductive," 
Kim Young Sam told Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Beckwith said that Quayle was "surprised by the unanimity" of opinion on the 
troop-strength issue. 
</P>
<P>
South Korean government officials have expressed considerable anxiety over the 
possibility of a troop cut, repeatedly asking Quayle about proposals in 
Congress for such a move. The Bush Administration opposes reducing troop 
strength here and, for now, the idea appears to have relatively little support 
in Congress.

QUAYLE VISITS PANMUNJOM TRUCE VILLAGE 
</P>

PANMUNJOM, Korea 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casting aside security concerns to take a closer look at one of the world's 
tensest borders, Vice President Dan Quayle today became the highest-ranking 
U.S. official ever to visit this truce village in the Korean demilitarized 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
While American Presidents and vice presidents have visited South Korea and the 
DMZ on several occasions, they have avoided trips to Panmunjom because of the 
proximity of North Korean troops and the difficulty of ensuring security. 
Secret Service agents had ruled out a visit by Quayle for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
But after visiting several other DMZ outposts, Quayle made a last-minute 
decision to change the route. Accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, and Donald 
Gregg, U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Quayle climbed to the top of the pagoda 
tower overlooking the border and conference building here. As he watched, U.S. 
troops photographed North Korean troops photographing the official visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, Quayle descended 200 feet below the DMZ to inspect a 
North Korean infiltration tunnel dug a decade ago under the rolling hills of 
the border region. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody thinks North Korea is a passive nation, I suggest they go down and 
visit this tunnel," Quayle said as he emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, wide enough for four soldiers to march abreast, is one of three 
discovered in the late 1970s. Army officials believe the North Koreans dug the 
tunnels under the 2 1/2-mile-wide DMZ as a potential invasion route to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it shows the fanaticism of that nation," Quayle said, "and how far 
they are willing to go to export destabilization." 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel inspection and the tour of Panmunjom capped a two-day trip to South 
Korea. The visit was the first stop on a four-nation Asian tour that will take 
Quayle to Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia before he returns to Washington 
on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DMZ Tour Dramatizes Theme 
</P>
<P>
The DMZ tour was designed to dramatize the central theme of Quayle's visit here 
-- the continuing military threat posed by North Korea and the resulting need 
to keep 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in the south. 
</P>
<P>
As he stressed the need for a continued military presence, Quayle soft-pedaled 
concerns over continued human rights violations in South Korea. He praised the 
south's "political transformation and movement toward democracy" and 
complimented President Roh Tae Woo on "moderation in the face of radical 
violence that seems designed to provoke overreaction." 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. Embassy officials have expressed private concerns over the human 
rights situation here, the Administration has carefully avoided any public 
criticism of Roh and his government. 
</P>
<P>
Korean opposition leaders charge that after two years of liberalization, Roh's 
government recently has turned toward a more repressive course. They cite 
figures released Tuesday by a committee of the Korean National Assembly that 
show a sharp increase in arrests under the country's strict National Security 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government last month indicted Kim Dae Jung, the nation's 
best-known opposition figure. The indictment, which Kim has denounced, charges 
that he failed to report an opposition legislator's trip to North Korea and 
received money from the legislator that the legislator received from North 
Korean agents. 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle sidestepped that issue in meetings with Roh, Kim and other Korean 
leaders. Roh, U.S. officials said, assured Quayle that he "would not turn back" 
toward repressive policies of past Korean governments. "The vice president was 
happy about that," spokesman David Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
Although complaints of a government crackdown have been a major part of the 
opposition's political program, neither Kim Dae Jung nor Kim Young Sam, the 
other main opposition leader, raised the issue directly during a meeting with 
Quayle at the National Assembly on Wednesday afternoon.

Pan American World Airways has been fined $630,000 for security violations 
discovered in the course of an investigation spurred by the terrorist bombing 
of Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Dec. 21 disaster, the Federal Aviation Administration 
found lapses in Pan Am's passenger and baggage screening at Frankfurt and 
London, where the New York-bound flight originated and stopped. FAA spokesman 
John Leyden said, however, that there was no direct relation between the lapses 
and the destruction of the plane in which 270 people died. 
</P>
<P>
The airline has 30 days to appeal the fines, among the largest ever leveled for 
security violations. The fines also cited three other Pan Am flights at London 
and two others at Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
The since-corrected violations were discovered between Dec. 22 and Jan. 31, 
Leyden said. Two months before the bombing, the FAA warned Pan Am to beef up 
some of its security procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player in the 
baggage compartment blew apart the Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
Leyden said that the violations included failure to identify passengers for 
further screening before allowing them and their baggage aboard the flight, 
improper methods used to check carry-on baggage of passengers and failure to 
conduct the required search of cargo areas before loading the airliner. 
</P>
<P>
Leyden also said that although one ticket holder in London did not board, his 
baggage was allowed to be placed on the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"The matters raised were generally of an administrative, rather than 
substantive, nature," said Thomas G. Plaskett, chairman and chief executive 
officer of Pan Am. " . . . There is no evidence that any of the items noted in 
the December inspection by the FAA were in any way related to the bombing of 
our aircraft.

MOSCOW KEEPING UP STRATEGIC ARMS STRENGTH, CHENEY ASSERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Although the Soviet Union has begun to transfer its economic resources away 
from conventional military production, the government of President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev has not reduced its commitment to strategic military development, 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Wednesday in a meeting with editors and 
reporters of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in the strategic military posture of the Soviet 
Union," Cheney said. "If anything, their strategic military capabilities 
(including long-range missiles) are more robust today than they were four years 
ago, when he came to power." 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney said there is evidence that Gorbachev is beginning to reallocate 
Soviet resources "away from the military to the civilian side of his house." He 
said that the rate of Soviet tank production, for example, was reduced this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technology Seen as Target 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also said he believes Gorbachev has pursued a "kindler and gentler" 
foreign policy -- partly in hopes of gaining access to advanced Western 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary said the promise of obtaining that competitively important 
technology may explain why the Soviet military has so far supported Gorbachev's 
extensive economic and political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney advocated U.S. caution in assuming that changes in the Soviet Union will 
continue and that they will be favorable to American interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time for us to dismantle our alliances . . . nor is it time to 
think that there's sufficient change in the Soviet Union or in the East Bloc 
for us to fundamentally alter . . . the heart of our policies and strategies of 
the last 40 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney called production of the B-2 Stealth bomber and development of the 
Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars," key elements of America's 
strategic defense plans, and he said he expects them to continue. Past U.S. 
defense decisions were made based on assumptions that such systems would be 
developed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, Cheney said U.S. military personnel sent to foreign 
countries to support the war on drugs will do so only at the invitation of the 
host country and will not participate in any operations missions, either 
directly or in support of local forces. 
</P>
<P>
He said American forces will stay in "relatively secure areas" and support 
training and maintenance missions. "But I can't say that the operations will be 
risk-free," he cautioned.

WASHINGTON OFFICIALS PAINT GRIM PICTURE OF CHAOS THAT LED TO APPROVAL OF TROOPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in Washington painted a grim portrait Wednesday of the chaos in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands that led President Bush to authorize the use of federal 
troops, FBI agents and U.S. marshals to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
While Hurricane Hugo's destruction of communications links left details of the 
disorders unclear, one Interior Department official reported that every store 
on St. Croix appeared to have been looted. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is beyond the resources of the local authorities to control," 
said a senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guard Reports Unconfirmed 
</P>
<P>
There were reports that National Guardsmen and police officers on the islands 
had taken part in the looting. However, a National Guard spokesman in 
Washington quoted Maj. Gen. Robert L. Moorehead, the commander of the National 
Guard on the Virgin Islands, as saying that reports of guardsmen "taking part 
in civil disobedience were not confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials reported to Congress, based on sketchy reports 
from ham radio operators, that unknown numbers of prisoners on St. Croix had 
escaped and were armed with guns. The prisoners were said to include drug 
offenders, murderers and rapists. 
</P>
<P>
One Administration official, expressing caution, raised the possibility that 
ham radio operators, relaying reports from point to point, may have exaggerated 
the seriousness of the situation. "We'll have to see for ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources also said that the Federal Emergency Management 
Administration confirmed that local police were involved in some looting. But 
they said the agency was not being allowed to publicize such reports out of 
concern that they would embarrass Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly. 
</P>
<P>
Farrelly said Wednesday night he had not asked for the troops Bush authorized. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, top generals meeting in the underground operations center 
planned the dispatch of about 1,100 troops to the islands aboard 16 C-141 
Starlifter transports. A White House official said that the first units would 
probably arrive in St. Croix by 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Those selected were the 720th MP Battalion -- with companies at Ft. Polk, La., 
Ft. Hood, Tex., and Ft. Leonard Wood, Mo. -- the 503rd MP Battalion from Ft. 
Bragg, N.C., and the 16th MP Brigade Headquarters from Ft. Bragg. They were 
taking along their own vehicles, three OH-58 helicopters, and "appropriate 
medical support" the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FBI's 50-agent hostage rescue team, specially trained for such 
emergency assignments, was scheduled to leave the Washington area in military 
aircraft at 3 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal troops have not been used to suppress rioting since 1968, when they 
were deployed in Washington, D.C., after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. The use of troops was authorized in 1987 to deal with prison riots in 
Atlanta, but they were never deployed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites 'Domestic Violence' 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Bush said: "I have been informed that conditions of 
domestic violence and disorder exist in and about the Virgin Islands." A 
separate executive order said "members of the armed forces of the United States 
will be used to suppress the violence." 
</P>
<P>
The President's decision was announced at the end of a day in which reports of 
a general breakdown of law and order continued to descend on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
From St. Croix, a senior U.S. official reported to the White House that there 
would be "anarchy soon if something is not done," a Bush Administration source 
said. Similarly, the Coast Guard reported that "the situation is serious; 
looting and civil disturbances are continuing." 
</P>
<P>
The scope of the apparent disorder was reflected in a report from one federal 
official on St. Croix, who advised superiors in Washington that the systems of 
government and law enforcement "are not in working order," and that "order is 
in need of restoration." 
</P>
<P>
At least one of six Coast Guard cutters deployed off St. Croix was sheltering 
people who sought help not because of the hurricane but because of fears for 
their safety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cleanup Must Wait 
</P>
<P>
Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said that Undersecretary Frank A. 
Bracken reported that any cleanup effort would have to wait until order had 
been restored. 
</P>
<P>
"He said there had been a lot of devastation, that every store he had seen on 
the island appeared to have been looted, and that he was very concerned about 
security," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Bush declared the Virgin Islands a disaster area, making 
them eligible for low-interest loans for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fitzwater said that the Interior Department had made $500,000 
available for the purchase of food, safety supplies, and "rudimentary equipment 
to help in cleaning up, such as chain saws, nails, wood. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He said a fleet of Air Force transports were carrying portable generators and 
communications gear, while others were dispatched to evacuate Americans from 
Andros Island, farther north.

PANEL RECOMMENDS POWELL, 20-0, TO HEAD JOINT CHIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Colin L. Powell, 52, won unanimous approval from the Senate Armed Services 
Committee on Wednesday to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with both 
Republicans and Democrats hailing him as an outstanding choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel voted 20 to 0 to recommend Powell's nomination to the full 
Senate. If confirmed, Powell, who would be the youngest officer to head the 
Joint Chiefs, would replace Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The committee action came after several hours of a confirmation hearing at 
which Powell told the panel that he has "some level of confidence" that reforms 
might succeed in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Such reforms, he said, would give the United States "opportunities to reshape 
our defense programs, our national security policies and our armed forces. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
But he warned that changes in Soviet military capabilities, not budget 
restraints, should prompt the scale-back and called for continued modernization 
of long-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very premature to start basing any of our plans and programs and actions" 
on assumptions of Gorbachev's success, said Powell. "But I think it is not 
premature to begin thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
His comments came as senior Bush Administration officials offered increasingly 
gloomy assessments of Gorbachev's prospects for success. On the eve of a key 
meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, several U.S. officials have backed away from 
earlier expressions of active U.S. support for the Soviet leader's reform 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects 'Backward Steps' 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the rising skepticism, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam 
Nunn (D-Ga.) told Powell: "We certainly, I think, have to be prepared for 
backward steps to occur in the Soviet Union. Almost inevitably, we'll have 
disruptions and changes, perhaps with suddenness, perhaps at times with 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing the 31-year veteran to lead the nation's 2 million troops, 
President Bush skipped over several more senior military officers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easier decision simply to go down a few numbers, as we say, and pick 
the next senior officer," said Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the Senate panel's 
ranking minority member. "But here, a deep selection was made, which conveys to 
me that the President and his principal advisers thought carefully and long 
about this particular selection, and I think it was a wise one." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing praise for Powell, who would be the first black to head the nation's 
military services, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) called Powell's appointment 
"one of the finest appointments that our President has made." Nunn said that 
Powell offered "tremendous . . . talent, insight, and experience." 
</P>
<P>
Powell now serves as commander of the U.S. Forces Command, which oversees all 
U.S.-based troops. Those include the active and reserve forces that are slated 
to play a major role in the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to lawmaker's concerns, Powell said that he would make the 
military's role in the drug war one of his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reservations and I know that none of my colleagues have any 
reservations," said Powell. "The American people have spoken clearly on this 
one. We ought to be concerned about this cancer that is in our midst, and I 
think we do have capabilities to bring to this war," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Over Border 
</P>
<P>
"In Forces Command, I have got people jumping through their butts right now 
trying to see which forces that are available . . . (that) can be diverted from 
other missions, other training activities, to work with the Border Patrol and 
see if we can do a better job of sealing the border between the United States 
and Mexico," said Powell. 
</P>
<P>
Powell told lawmakers that as the President's principal military adviser in a 
time of shrinking budgets, he would "rather have (a force) that is smaller, as 
long as it's always ready to perform, as advertised, and when called upon."

'AVERAGE' CAR EMISSION PLAN BLOCKED BY PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
ACTION MEANS EACH VEHICLE -- NOT MAKER'S FLEET OVERALL -- WOULD MEET CLEAN-AIR 
STANDARDS

<P>
Environmentalists won a major victory Wednesday when a House subcommittee voted 
unanimously to remove from President Bush's clean air bill a controversial 
provision allowing automobile manufacturers to "average" tailpipe emissions to 
meet federal anti-pollution requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The House Energy and Commerce health and environment subcommittee agreed 
unanimously by voice vote to delete the averaging provisions from the 
President's bill -- the first major legislation designed to clean up the 
environment since the Clean Air Act was last amended in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, which most committee members and lobbyists agreed effectively kills 
the averaging plan, means that automobile manufacturers will have to ensure 
that each car they make meets the new, stricter standards for tailpipe 
emissions by 1998. Under the Administration's original proposal, some new cars 
could have exceeded the standards so long as the average emission of all the 
cars produced by each manufacturer did not exceed them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprised Opponent 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the averaging proposal, which the Administration's supporters 
had defended vigorously earlier in the week, came so suddenly that it appeared 
to surprise even its chief opponent, subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Waxman Tuesday had lost a first-round attempt to strengthen the clean air 
bill's anti-smog provisions in a narrow 12-10 vote, and seemed prepared for a 
spirited battle Wednesday. He opened hearings with a strong attack on the 
averaging proposal as a "travesty for consumers" that would actually "cause 
more pollution, take away consumer protections and create bureaucratic 
nightmares for effective enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Most observers and committee members had expected that verbal salvo to serve as 
the cue for Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), Waxman's nemesis on clear air 
issues, to champion the averaging proposals on behalf of the Detroit auto 
interests he represents. But the anticipated duel failed to materialize when 
Dingell, chairman of the full committee, surprised most of his colleagues by 
voting in favor of an amendment to delete the averaging provision. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, a chief sponsor of the Bush bill, fended off questions about his 
decision to support the Waxman proposal, saying that "I just wanted my 
colleagues to feel comfortable." However, he refused to rule out the 
possibility of trying to revive the averaging proposal when the clean air bill 
goes to the full committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dingell Supporters 
</P>
<P>
"This subcommittee is heavily stacked with Dingell supporters," noted Daniel 
Weiss, Washington director of the Sierra Club's pollution and toxics program. 
"If he (Dingell) can't get the votes he wants for averaging here, he's not 
going to be able to get them anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said that he thought Dingell and his allies "saw the handwriting on the 
wall and went along rather than take a loss" on the averaging issue. He said 
that the next step in the hearings, which reconvene Tuesday, will be to tackle 
the question of emissions standards. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman wants to tighten the standards in the Bush plan by requiring new cars to 
meet emission standards currently in effect in California by 1993, with a 
further reduction of 50% by the year 2000. Under the Bush bill, auto makers 
would have until 1998 to meet standards equal to or, in the case of carbon 
monoxide emissions, considerably more lenient than those already in effect in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
While environmentalists hailed the vote, several expressed concern that 
Dingell's about-face on the issue may be only tactical -- a maneuver to regroup 
and to dig into position for the bigger battle next week, when the subcommittee 
debates the standards for tailpipe emissions.

HAZARD OF TAINTED FOOD IMPORTS CITED BY PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGING FDA FAILS TO SHIELD CONSUMER, DINGELL CALLS SAFEGUARDS A 'RUSSIAN 
ROULETTE SYSTEM'

<P>
It started in February in Starkville, Miss. Twenty-two people suffered severe 
nausea and vomiting after eating hamburgers and mushroom omelets in a student 
cafeteria at Mississippi State University. In Queens, N.Y., two weeks later, 
another 48 were stricken with similar symptoms after eating lunch at the salad 
bar of the employees' cafeteria at Peninsula Hospital Center. Two months later, 
another 32 persons in two Pennsylvania towns got sick after eating restaurant 
pizza. No one died, but at least 15 people were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit: canned mushrooms imported from China that were contaminated with 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials believe this is the only known large-scale outbreak of 
food-borne disease that has been linked to imported canned food. But they have 
logged more than 1,100 isolated consumer complaints associated with canned 
imported food during the last five years, and warn that there are probably 
numerous others that go unreported every year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tainted Products 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Food and Drug Administration -- which is responsible for 
inspecting and regulating imported fruits, vegetables and canned foods -- has 
failed to protect American consumers from tainted imported products, 
particularly low acid foods that are canned, congressional investigators have 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an absolute Russian roulette system," Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) said 
Wednesday. "The chance that a contaminated shipment will be detected is small 
and the penalties are even smaller. Basically, the American consumer is on his 
or her own when it comes to imported foods." 
</P>
<P>
Dingell chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations, which has been conducting a far-reaching inquiry 
into the regulatory activities of the FDA. The subcommittee is expected to make 
public its findings on how the federal agency inspects and monitors imported 
low-acid canned foods at a hearing Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials, who have been cooperating with the subcommittee investigation, 
said that they too are frustrated by their inability to crack down on imported 
foods. But, they said, they simply don't have enough resources to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA uses its limited resources to target imports where we suspect there 
may be violations but obviously we can't look at everything," said Jeff Nesbit, 
an FDA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, the FDA will act only after something happens and then the agency 
is often forced to divert resources from other areas of its operations to meet 
the emergency. For example, during the scare last March over cyanide-laced 
Chilean grapes -- which resulted in a temporary ban on all fruit imported from 
Chile -- the FDA invoked a sort of regulatory triage by shifting numerous 
personnel and funds from other areas of the agency to meet the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Imported foods, including noncanned items, make up 9% of the total U.S. food 
consumption, according to the subcommittee. Of that, the FDA physically 
inspects and tests only 2%, trying to focus on products where they suspect a 
potential risk, the subcommittee said. Of that 2%, about 40% are rejected 
because they are contaminated, the subcommittee said. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you wonder about the rest," one subcommittee source said. 
</P>
<P>
But the FDA's Nesbit emphasized that the rejection rate is so high "because we 
look at shipments where we suspect we will find problems." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, which is second to the New York-Newark area in the volume of 
imported items it receives, there are only nine inspectors to handle an 
estimated 9,000 shipments every month, including foods, drugs, medical devices 
and other items, subcommittee sources said. Further, they said, inspectors in 
Los Angeles physically examine only four of 4,500 shipments of canned foods 
that enter every month. The rest is done through paper work, by making sure 
that the overseas facilities are registered with the FDA, the subcommittee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But subcommittee investigators said that a registration number is no guarantee 
that the products that the plant produces are safe. "It's easy to obtain a 
registration number," one subcommittee investigator said. "All you have to do 
is fill out a piece of paper. It does not involve any inspections." 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 3,000 facilities around the world that have registered with 
the FDA to produce low-acid canned foods, he said, and the FDA has performed 
only 31 overseas inspections of these facilities during the last five years. 
All 14 of the plants inspected in 1988 failed, he said, but only two were 
placed on a probationary status known as "automatic detention." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deadly Canned Fish 
</P>

Subcommittee investigators said that one Manila plant that produced canned fish 
was inspected by military medical officers in 1987 after the company applied 
for permission to sell its goods to the Defense Department. The inspectors 
wrote in a report, obtained by the subcommittee, that the plant was "capable of 
causing serious illness and death to consumers of their products." The military 
turned its findings over to the FDA, which sent its own investigators to 
confirm what the military had found. The FDA immediately placed the company on 
automatic detention. 
</P>
<P>
However, the subcommittee said, by last month, the Manila plant was returned to 
normal status without a follow-up inspection. 
</P>
<P>
When a firm is placed under "automatic detention," its products are supposed to 
be detained when they arrive until they can be examined, the subcommittee said. 
But products often reach local importers before they can be stopped and are 
released into commerce.

THE NIGHT STALKER VERDICTS; 
</P>
<P>
KILLER'S CHAIR IS EMPTY IN SOLEMN COURTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For six months in 1985, Richard Ramirez was an elusive source of terror, 
stalking random victims under cover of darkness. On Wednesday afternoon, as a 
jury prepared to declare him guilty of 13 murders and 30 related felonies, 
Ramirez again managed to vanish from view. 
</P>
<P>
At his request, Ramirez was escorted by seven deputies to a courtroom holding 
cell where, alone, he would listen to the verdicts via a sound system. His foot 
chains jangled as he was led away. 
</P>
<P>
So there was an empty yellow chair at the defense table as the verdicts came 
in. It was one of the few unoccupied seats in the courtroom of Superior Court 
Judge Michael A. Tynan, who has presided over the Night Stalker trial for six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Courtroom Is Filled 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom on this day was filled with seven relatives of Ramirez's victims 
and more than 70 reporters, court watchers, detectives and district attorney's 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
It took more than 30 minutes for all of the verdicts to be read. After 
completing the first 10, Tynan's shaky-voiced clerk, Josephine Williams, asked 
to be relieved of the task. Tynan continued himself. 
</P>
<P>
During the reading, the 12 jurors and seven alternates stared solemnly ahead. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Halpin jotted notes on a legal pad. Defense attorney 
Daniel Hernandez stared at the judge as he repeated the words. 
</P>
<P>
For each count, the same conclusion was read: "We the jury in the above 
entitled action find the defendant Richard Ramirez guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The dry legalese seemed in jarring contrast to the horror of the acts they 
ascribed to Ramirez, count by count. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present was Judith Arnold. One July day in 1985, she had discovered 
the bodies of her parents, Maxon and and Lela Kneiding, in their Glendale home. 
They had failed to show up in church. Both had been shot in the head and their 
throats were slashed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to see justice done. It's been too long," Arnold had said minutes 
before the jurors filed into the 11th-floor courtroom of the downtown Criminal 
Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, her husband Bill's arm around her shoulder, sat flush-faced as the 
verdicts were read. When Tynan came to the Kneidings' names, counts 28 through 
30, Arnold gripped her husband's right hand tightly and shut her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Guilty," said the judge evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold breathed deeply, opened her eyes, and daubed at her tears with a tissue. 
</P>
<P>
A little later, Arnold said she felt "somewhat" relieved. She said she would 
reserve further comment until after the penalty phase of the trial, in which 
Ramirez could be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Also present were the son and two grandchildren of Joyce Nelson, a 61-year-old 
Monterey Park resident bludgeoned to death in July, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Sick to Watch 
</P>
<P>
Before the verdict in the Nelson murder was announced, her granddaughter 
hurriedly left the courtroom. She whispered to her father that she was too sick 
to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Ramirez, other regulars at his trial were missing at the end Wednesday. 
About 10 women of all ages had appeared faithfully as Ramirez's case slowly 
wound its way through the preliminary hearing phase and into trial. 
</P>
<P>
The women never fully explained the attraction Ramirez held for them, although 
some said they were convinced of his innocence and a few described him as 
attractive. In any case, none showed up for the verdict.

NIGHT STALKER'S ATTACKS LEAVE LINGERING LEGACY OF SUFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After 60-year-old Joyce Nelson was murdered in her Monterey Park home four 
years ago -- a victim of a serial killer known as the Night Stalker -- the 
mourners included a boy named Jeff and a man named Steb. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff was Nelson's 13-year-old grandson. Steb was her gentleman friend and had 
been for decades. Not long after Nelson's death, Steb died too, of heart 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't say heart attack," Jeff Nelson, now 17, said Wednesday. "We say it 
was a broken heart." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff recounted the sad love story upon learning that a jury had convicted 
Richard Ramirez of 13 murders, including that of his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
As Jeff knows too well, the Night Stalker had many victims whose names never 
appeared in police reports. People like Steb. 
</P>
<P>
And in a sense, Ramirez stalked victims long after his arrest. For hundreds of 
people who found themselves within the spectrum of his evil, nightmares, 
depression and enduring grief remain Ramirez's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
The worst is felt by people who actually survived his attacks. There were 
several rape victims and people who survived gunshots. A 16-year-girl was 
bludgeoned with a tire iron but lived. 
</P>
<P>
William Carns of Mission Viejo lived despite taking three bullets to the head. 
Orange County prosecutors say the Night Stalker fired the shots, but the case 
might never be put to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Now in recuperative therapy in Minnesota, Carns was left with a bullet lodged 
inside his skull, with a damaged memory, paralysis of his left arm and left leg 
and tear ducts that do not work. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear Wednesday whether Ramirez will be brought to trial for related 
charges in other counties. 
</P>
<P>
If Ramirez receives a death sentence for his Los Angeles crime rampage, he may 
not be prosecuted in the Carns case, Orange County Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. 
James G. Enright said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money and Pain 
</P>
<P>
The charges might be dropped to save time, money and the pain it would inflict 
on Carns' then-fiancee, who was raped in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who is now 33 and living in Northern California, told The Times that 
the verdict, although just, can never eliminate the emotional scars. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to know justice has been done, but it doesn't change what's 
happened to Bill or to me or to the other victims, or put our lives back the 
way they were," she said. "It brings up a lot of old, hard memories. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Even after this many years," she said, "it's still a big part of my life. It 
changes you forever. You can never go back to the way you were." 
</P>
<P>
Families and friends of the victims on Wednesday expressed hope that the 
verdict and sentencing to come will help them get beyond their own anguish. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can sleep now; I haven't in four years," said Jean Camou, a 
sister-in-law of murder victim Mary Cannon. "I was extremely happy with the 
verdict. But I don't think one ever gets over something like that." 
</P>
<P>
She added that her late husband, Edmond Camou, hardly ever talked about his 
sister after she was found with her throat slashed on July 1, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very difficult for him to even mention her name or read about the 
trial in the newspaper," Camou said. 
</P>
<P>
On yet another level, several people who encountered Ramirez through the legal 
process -- from investigators to lawyers to journalists -- found their own 
lives and psychic well-being profoundly affected by the experience, so vivid 
and troubling were the accounts of his crimes. During the trial, Ramirez 
frequently turned to watch his audience, sometimes with a smirk, sometimes with 
a chilling stare. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors devoted months to the trial. Some people openly wondered whether the 
August murder of juror Phyllis Singletary in a domestic dispute -- and the 
subsequent suicide of her suspected killer, James C. Melton -- may have been in 
some way influenced by the pressures of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
When one of Ramirez's attorneys, Daniel V. Hernandez, asked to excused from the 
case last March, saying that he was emotionally drained, Judge Kenneth Tynan 
was unsympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us have chest pains, some of us have bellyaches, but the point is that 
we all suffer stress in these cases," Tynan told Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the news media had their own stories. One reporter planned to write 
a book on the case, but as the grim testimony moved on, he said, he would lie 
awake nights and double-check the locks on doors and windows to make sure his 
family was safe. He abandoned plans for a book. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News Programs 
</P>
<P>
Mary Chaney, a free-lance artist who made more than 100 sketches of Ramirez for 
television news programs, spoke of nightmares -- awakening with a chill and 
seeing the Night Stalker at her bedside. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd just be standing there," Chaney recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, she said, nothing happened -- "but in another nightmare, he did kill 
me." 
</P>
<P>
The verdict, Chaney said, was a relief. 
</P>
<P>
"You could never get over the testimony of Judith Arnold, who found her 
parents. Or her sister that identified the mother's wedding ring," Chaney said. 
"Or even the policeman -- policemen who have seen too much. Too many murders. 
There's just something in their eyes, in their expression." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff, whose family lives in Chino, said that he is gradually coping with the 
loss of his grandmother. He remembers still how she often told him how much he 
was like her own boy, his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I could talk to her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff remembered the night of the phone call. He remembered his father, in 
hushed tones, telling his stepmother, "Don't tell him, don't tell him." 
</P>
<P>
He remembered also how his father came into the living room, sat down beside 
him and said that his grandmother was dead -- that she had been murdered. 
</P>
<P>
"I started crying, and he started crying too. . . . Until then, he had been 
stoic," Jeff remembered, his tone subdued. 
</P>
<P>
Upon learning about the evidence, the family never doubted Ramirez's guilt, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're constantly saying the gas chamber's not good enough for him," Jeff said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff said he thinks often about his grandmother, especially at Thanksgiving and 
Christmas. Christmas is still a big event in the family -- "same people, but 
one less." Thanksgiving is another story. His grandmother used to cook a turkey 
with stuffing -- "everything," Jeff recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jeff said, "Thanksgiving is pretty much down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Catherine Gewertz and Carol McGraw contributed to this 
story.

<TEXT>
<P>
The list below illustrates the complex web of direct and circumstantial 
evidence against Richard Ramirez, including incriminating statements he made 
after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43 felony charges involved 13 murders. Prosecutors said most of the crimes 
contained various Ramirez "signatures," such as "distinctive" and "gaping" stab 
and slash wounds to the throat or body; the language he used that was recounted 
by survivors; the use of ligatures and restraints, including handcuffs and 
thumbcuffs, and unusual Avia shoe prints at some of the crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another alleged Ramirez trademark was the pentagram, which first appeared at 
the scene of a murder in Monrovia, drawn on a bedroom wall and on a victim's 
thigh. Such pentagrams also were found on the dashboard of Ramirez's car and on 
his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Four handguns were used, but only one was recovered. However, firearms tests 
showed that unused bullets in a Ramirez bag had been loaded into the gun that 
was used in two of the incidents. Finally, about 375 pieces of jewelry and 
other personal property taken from six of the murder sites were recovered and 
linked to Ramirez.

SCENE OF CAPTURE UNALTERED BY TOUCH OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Immediately after seeing a composite drawing of the Night Stalker suspect on 
television, Tina Pinon turned to her father and begged him not to leave their 
East Los Angeles house for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
That was four years ago, and like millions of others in Southern California at 
the time the teen-age girl was fearful of a nocturnal visit by a vicious serial 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry, mijita," Faustino Pinon told his then 15-year-old daughter that 
hot August night. "If he comes to our house, I'll catch him." 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Pinon was true to his word. 
</P>
<P>
Pinon, a 60-year-old retired auto worker, was checking a transmission leak 
under another daughter's fire-engine-red 1965 Mustang when a shadowy figure 
dressed in black leaped over his back-yard fence and into the already running 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a gun. I want the car," the stranger said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what you have," Pinon shouted back. "You're not taking my 
daughter's car." 
</P>
<P>
A struggle over the keys ensued. The men grappled on the grass. The stranger 
broke away and dashed across the street. There, he tried to steal the car of 
another neighbor, Angelina De La Torre, in the 3700 block of East Hubbard 
Street, a residential area of mostly working-class Latinos just east of the Los 
Angeles city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the would-be car thief was pummeled into submission by a mob of 
angry neighbors, including Pinon, Angelina's husband, Manuel De La Torre, who 
clobbered the suspect on the head with a metal pipe, Pinon's next-door 
neighbor, Jose Burgoin, and his sons Jaime and Julio. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few of them knew at the time that they had just caught one of the city's 
most notorious criminals, or that Ramirez had been on the run for more than 
four miles that morning, zig-zagging his way through alleys and back yards and 
trying to break into cars. 
</P>
<P>
The chase had begun at 8:30 a.m. when an unidentified resident telephoned the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Hollenbeck Division to report that a man 
matching the description of the Night Stalker was acting suspiciously at Euclid 
Avenue and Garnet Street. 
</P>
<P>
Black-and-white units and a police helicopter were already closing in after 9 
a.m. when Ramirez made the mistake of trying to steal the car of Pinon's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," a police officer at the scene told Pinon that day. "That's 
the Night Stalker suspect, Richard Ramirez." 
</P>
<P>
Tina began to cry uncontrollably. Her father started to shake hard. 
</P>
<P>
The capture, which was called "heroic" by city officials including Mayor Tom 
Bradley, brought a swift and unexpected end to seven months of terror wrought 
by the then-25-year-old drifter from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
It also brought a measure of fame to Hubbard Street and its heroes, each of 
whom has a wall in their home set aside for numerous plaques they received from 
city, county and state officials in honor of their bravery. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Pinon, wife Reyna, and daughter Tina sat quietly together on a 
brown sofa in their modest stucco house and watched on television -- live and 
in color -- as Ramirez was convicted of 13 murders and 30 related felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Pinon yawned when the verdicts were read. An ice cream truck's bells rang 
outside, and he asked if anyone was hungry. He seemed bored. His share of the 
excitement had come four years before. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on Hubbard Street, neighbors spoke of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a relief that he is going to be punished for what he did," said Al 
Trainor, 30, who lives a few houses down from Pinon. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tell people about how he was captured in front of my house," Trainor 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who lived on the block at the time of the capture have since 
moved away, and for all appearances Wednesday Hubbard Street appeared much as 
it had that Saturday morning in 1985 -- a quiet, blue-collar residential 
street. Nothing much has changed as a result of its brush with fame. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Pinon, De La Torre, the Burgoins and perhaps as many as 17 other people 
involved in the capture are wondering whether they can lay legitimate claim to 
an estimated $80,000 in reward money pledged by public agencies and private 
groups including the city and county of Los Angeles and the state of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The money was pledged for the apprehension of the suspect but was not to be 
distributed until the end of Ramirez's trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about what I'll do with the money, if I get any," said 
Burgoin, a retired construction worker living on a monthly pension of $1,078. 
"But sure, I could use it." 
</P>

A postman was killed by a parcel bomb in the Basque town of Renteria on 
Wednesday, the third person killed by such a device in Spain this month. 
</P>
<P>
Police said both of the young postman's hands were blown off and he died on the 
spot. Several people were wounded by the blast which occurred when the postman 
was on his mail round. 
</P>
<P>
The provincial governor's office said it suspected that the bomb had been 
posted by the guerrilla group ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom). 
</P>
<P>
ETA has claimed responsibility for one of the letter bomb deaths. It warned 
that more letter bombs are on their way to prison officials to protest against 
the government's policy of moving jailed guerrillas from high security prisons 
to jails all over the country.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ORGANISMS NOT DANGEROUS, SCIENCE PANEL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Organisms produced by genetic engineering techniques are fundamentally no 
different from those produced by conventional cross-breeding and are "not 
inherently dangerous," according to a report issued Wednesday by a special 
committee of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
For tests of some microorganisms that have a potential to threaten the 
environment, the committee recommended introduction of a "suicide gene" that 
would cause the mutated bacteria or virus to self-destruct after the test. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, there is no need for a major revision of existing rules governing 
the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment, the 
committee said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the decision to release engineered plants, bacteria and viruses into 
the environment "should focus on the characteristics of the plant or 
microorganism itself, not the techniques used to create it," said biochemist 
Robert H. Burris of the University of Wisconsin, chairman of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Engineered plants are especially safe, the committee said, because they 
"rarely, if ever, escape to cause problems in the natural ecosystem." Release 
of microorganisms requires more study, but "no adverse effects have developed" 
from such introductions in the past, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Since the techniques of genetic engineering were first developed 15 years ago, 
controversy about the potential danger has surrounded it. Critics have charged 
that mutated bacteria or plants released into the environment during tests 
could escape and produce an ecological disaster. The new report seems to 
discount those objections. 
</P>
<P>
But activist Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a long-time 
opponent of genetic engineering, attacked the report as "irresponsible public 
policy," charging that the committee was motivated by "politics, not science." 
</P>
<P>
To date, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection 
Agency have issued about 80 permits for field testing of engineered organisms, 
most of them plants. But officials expect much larger numbers of applications 
in the future because of the great potential of genetically engineered 
organisms. 
</P>
<P>
Applications currently being pursued include bacteria that would degrade 
environmental pollutants and extract metals from ores, food plants that would 
flourish under dry or salty conditions, viruses that would control insect pests 
and crops that would resist weed killers and pests and, eventually, produce 
their own fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was created last year by the academy at the request of federal 
regulatory agencies to determine whether new rules should be developed for 
evaluating the growing number of applications. 
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that "society has benefited greatly from the use of genetically 
modified microorganisms and plants" and that field testing of new species "is 
essential" for the development of still better species. 
</P>
<P>
The testing of genetically engineered plants, they concluded, is particularly 
hazard free because scientists have already tested "hundreds of millions of 
genotypes . . . over decades" with no adverse effects. 
</P>
<P>
The report said genetically engineered plants may be safer than those produced 
by cross-breeding because the gene transfer is more precise. 
</P>
<P>
"The (genetic) techniques are . . . more predictable than the classical 
methods," Burris said at a Washington press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have argued that the biggest risk of field testing such plants is that 
they will escape and become weeds. But the committee concluded that the 
physiological characteristics that enable plants to thrive as weeds have been 
bred out of the crop species that researchers are experimenting on so that 
there is little risk that such plants could survive if they escaped from test 
plots. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, there is no need to change the way such experimental tests are 
evaluated, the committee concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"The laws as they exist now are adequate for this," said panel member Edward L. 
Korwek of the Washington-based law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have less experience with microorganisms, the panel said, but 
ecological uncertainties can be addressed by considering the changed properties 
of the microorganisms, in addition to such environmental considerations as 
nutrient availability. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the panel concluded that the fear of creating hazardous 
microorganisms, or pathogens, is overstated.

WHO WILL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM?; 
</P>
<P>
GIRL'S ACCIDENT PROMPTS A CALL BY FLORES FOR CURBING VENDOR'S TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, reacting to an accident in which a 
6-year-old girl's leg was broken, proposed Wednesday that the city consider 
more regulation or even an outright ban on ice cream trucks that traditionally 
have meandered through residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
"They say anything fun is fattening or dangerous," said Flores. And 
unfortunately that truism even applies to the neighborhood ice cream man, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
She introduced the motion after a Wilmington girl was injured in a double 
hit-and-run. She had chased, like children often do, the alluring tinkle of an 
ice cream truck's bells and was struck in the street by both the truck and a 
second vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
There was little about the incident that was unusual, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids get excited and dart into the street," said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Bob Jimenez, who has investigated accidents involving ice cream 
trucks, including the recent Wilmington incident. "It happens with some 
regularity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson adopted a ban three years ago, after a young girl was killed in an 
accident involving an ice cream truck, according to Mayor Pro Tem Kay Calas. 
And rather than running the City Council out of town, the community "was quite 
happy" with the ban, Calas said. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Lynwood, however, angry "people and kids" as they were described, 
didn't take the declaration of a cold war with good humor. They signed a 
petition to protest an ice cream truck ban adopted in that city in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the big fleets of Good Humor trucks that introduced generations to 
the sport of chasing the ice cream man are long gone, scores of independent 
dealers are keeping the tradition alive and kids continue to scream all summer 
long for ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, we really don't have quiet residential streets any more," said 
Richard McCaughey, a legislative analyst who helped draft the Los Angeles 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
McCaughey said the idea of a ban has been considered from time to time, "but 
it's been a sacred cow. It's like motherhood, apple pie and baseball." 
</P>
<P>
But Flores said the time has come to take a hard look at the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been concerned for quite some time and seen some close calls," said 
Flores. "And then came the Wilmington case." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a 6-year-old ran across Marine Street in Wilmington section of Los 
Angeles to join her 10-year-old sister, who was lined up with other 
neighborhood kids at an ice cream truck, according to Detective Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
Without warning, the driver began to back up the truck, knocking the little 
girl down, the detective said. The driver then pulled away, apparently unaware 
of what had happened. Then a second vehicle hit the girl, who was still on the 
ground, and that driver sped off, according to Jimenez. Police were searching 
Wednesday for the driver of the ice cream truck and have questioned a suspect 
about the second alleged hit-and-run vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to make it," said Jimenez of the injured girl. "But we have these 
(accidents) happening all over the city." 
</P>
<P>
Flores specifically has asked the city attorney to review the practice of 
selling ice cream from roving trucks, examine existing regulations and then 
make proposals that she anticipates could range from tightening controls to an 
outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
Flores aides said they were concerned that many operators are not properly 
insured, are not licensed with the county health department and park in illegal 
and dangerous locations. 
</P>
<P>
Communities which have sought to deal with these problems have split on what 
tack to take. 
</P>
<P>
While Carson and Lynwood went with a ban, Santa Ana chose to regulate the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Santa Ana city council -- prompted by a fatal accident -- adopted 
an ordinance that required ice cream truck operators to carry $1 million in 
liability insurance, register with the city and obtain a permit and provide 
photographs and fingerprints to police for background checks. The measure also 
prohibits ice cream truck operators from broadcasting music that lures children 
to their trucks.

SHERIFF'S DRUG TEAMS BROKEN UP IN INQUIRY FALLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has disbanded its four elite 
narcotics squads after the recent suspensions of nine officers suspected of 
stealing money seized during drug raids, The Times confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At least 30 officers were moved this week from the Narcotics Bureau 
headquarters in Whittier to stations throughout the county, according to union 
representatives and the chairman of the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has refused to comment on the reassignments, but 
sources said that the narcotics teams were dispersed as a precaution until 
local and federal investigations into alleged money skimming are complete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believed Temporary 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that it is a temporary reassignment," said Lt. Lee Mealy, 
president of the Los Angeles County Professional Peace Officers Assn., which 
represents some of the reassigned officers. "They apparently began Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shinee, chief attorney for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, 
said there was "absolutely no evidence" that the officers were transferred 
because they were suspected of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Shinee said the reassignment did not constitute a demotion and that wages and 
benefits are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
The Times confirmed independently through calls to sheriff's stations that 
officers from all three major narcotics units began working this week at a 
number of stations throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Edelman, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, said that he met with Sheriff 
Sherman Block late Wednesday and that the sheriff told him the major units have 
been broken up, but the deputies still are working as narcotics officers. 
</P>
<P>
"People were reassigned to stations, but they can follow leads anywhere," 
Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been reassured that there is no diminution by the Sheriff's Department 
in going after major narcotics dealers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Explanation Given 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said the sheriff did not explain his reasons for disbanding the units 
and refused to discuss the status of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The dismantled units were each composed of about 10 officers, most of them 
experienced in narcotics investigations. These specially trained teams, 
equipped with sophisticated surveillance equipment, have investigated the most 
important drug distribution and money-laundering cases handled by the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
The department's other narcotics officers are assigned to individual stations 
throughout the county and generally work smaller drug cases, including street 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sept. 1 Suspensions 
</P>
<P>
One of the four elite teams was taken out of service Sept. 1 when all nine of 
its members -- eight deputies and their sergeant -- were suspended on suspicion 
of stealing tens of thousands of dollars seized in drug raids during the last 
year. No charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
The suspended officers are Deputies Terrell H. Amers, James R. Bauder, Nancy A. 
Brown, Eufrasio G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson, Daniel M. Garner 
and Michael J. Kaliterna and Sgt. Robert Sobel. The officers are being paid, 
but they have surrendered their badges and guns. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department is analyzing cases assigned to the four "major 
violators" narcotics teams and deciding how to proceed with them, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the officers' unmarked cars have been taken from them, a narcotics 
investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the three reassigned teams will work as station-level narcotics 
officers, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Major Rethinking' 
</P>
<P>
The reassignments show that the Sheriff's Department "is going through a major 
rethinking of how they operate (narcotics investigations)," said one source 
familiar with the major narcotics units, which had expanded from one unit in 
1980 to the present four units. 
</P>
<P>
A member of one of the teams, reached at his new assignment at the Lomita 
station, said he could not say whether the arrangement is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he responded, "and I couldn't say if I did." He referred 
questions to the Sheriff's Information Bureau, which, along with Block and 
Undersheriff Robert A. Edmonds, has repeatedly refused comment on the new 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what impact the reassignments will have on 
crime-fighting efforts in the region, which federal officials say is the entry 
point for 40% of the nation's cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"That's obviously a major shake-up, (and) it would have a pretty major impact 
in Southern California, because they were one of the big enforcement groups in 
the area," said Brea Police Capt. Jim Oman, whose department has participated 
frequently in sheriff's raids. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Impact Expected 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for the federal Drug Enforcement Agency and the U.S. Customs 
Service, which also have worked closely with sheriff's investigators, said 
disbanding the four teams would not have a significant impact on the federal 
agencies' operations. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Glenn Levant, head of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
narcotics division, said that other law enforcement agencies that participate 
in a "narcotics information network" have continued to share their intelligence 
on drug dealers with the Sheriff's Department. Levant said his own department 
is still working cases with sheriff's narcotics officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this will result in anything negative," he said. "I would be 
absolutely shocked if this had any impact on our major cases. What I think is 
happening is that they're just sorting things out until they complete their 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how the shake-up ends, it could hurt the Sheriff's Department 
financially if it reduces its seizures of cash and property in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claim on Assets 
</P>
<P>
Seizures have been a boon to local police agencies since passage of a federal 
law in 1984 that allows the agencies to claim as much as 90% of the assets they 
seize in criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department reported seizing more than $33 million in cash during 
drug raids in 1988, and a large part of that will eventually be returned to the 
department. In fact, the department's anti-drug efforts are funded in part with 
seized money, and the most lucrative seizures have usually been made by the 
teams being disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department would not provide figures on the size of its 
Narcotic's Bureau budget, but the county budget for 1989-90 shows that all six 
of the sheriff's criminal investigative bureaus, including narcotics, have a 
total budget of about $42 million. The budget also reports that about $14 
million is available in a separate special fund from seizures in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the feds will just take it all over, but I don't think the sheriff is 
going to let all that easy money go," said David A. Elden, a well-known defense 
attorney in drug cases.

DREAM OF NEW LIFE IN THE SUN DIED IN HAIL OF POLICE BULLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<P>
Roger Bollinger was making a new life in California. 
</P>
<P>
At 52, the Ohio native had taken an early retirement and left his lifelong home 
in Cincinnati in January to move to Redondo Beach. He bought a condominium near 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
His best friend since high school, Gary L. Taylor, lived just down the road in 
Rancho Palos Verdes. And in March, Bollinger's ex-wife, Margaret, joined him in 
the condominium to attempt a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
But retirement and the sunny California climate that Bollinger sought had left 
something lacking, Margaret Bollinger said in a telephone interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bollinger died in a point-blank shoot-out with Redondo Beach police 
inside his condominium. Police said they believe that Bollinger shot and killed 
his old friend Taylor and was attempting to flee when officers broke down the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Leonard Knott, wounded in the gun battle, remained in serious condition 
Wednesday at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Bollinger said from Cincinnati that her ex-husband had come to 
California full of hope. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked forward to retirement," she said. "But he missed working. He was 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband, I think, was having a nervous breakdown. We had been very 
concerned about him, and we had all been trying to get him help." 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators found that Bollinger had been a successful businessman in 
Cincinnati with no apparent criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not the type to try and shoot it out with police," said Redondo Beach 
Police Lt. John Nelson. "We think he just went off the deep end." 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger had not been violent in the past, and Margaret Bollinger said that 
she had no recollection of him ever fighting with Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 52, had been counseling Bollinger, trying to bring him out of his 
depression, she said. Taylor "had been trying to help him, spending hours with 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Bollinger said she had decided to return to Cincinnati, but she would 
not say why. A neighbor in Redondo Beach said Margaret Bollinger had reported 
that she missed friends and relatives in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
She began the three-day drive to her hometown Sept. 12. Her husband had planned 
to follow in a few days, she said. When she left, there were no signs of 
trouble between her ex-husband and Taylor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two men ran deep. Taylor had served as an usher at the 
Bollingers' wedding. When the Bollingers reunited in California, they had 
become close with Taylor and his wife, Angie. 
</P>
<P>
"They were our best friends," Margaret Bollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger had recently told friends and acquaintances that he intended to sell 
his condominium to Taylor, police said. He invited several neighbors to his 
house last weekend for a garage sale in preparation for his return to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the day before the shooting, Bollinger walked across the street from 
his home to ask about becoming a salesman at Classic Motors on Pacific Coast 
Highway, salesman Greg Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
"This dude was spooky," said Peters, 20. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger talked rapidly, and his shoulders twitched, Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger visited for most of the day at the dealership before the owner told 
him that he would not be hired because "he did not seem to fit in," said Frank 
Usesi, another salesman at Classic Motors. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Nelson said Bollinger had apparently begun selling cars on his own from his 
condominium. He kept several of them parked on Francisca Avenue, the sedate 
street in front of his home. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was described to police as a businessman who owned real estate and other 
investments, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The killings were preceded Tuesday by a loud argument in the condominium about 
1:30 p.m., neighbors told police. Moments later, gunshots rang out. 
</P>
<P>
Four Redondo Beach officers responded to a call from neighbors. They pounded on 
the door and, when no one answered, kicked it down. 
</P>
<P>
The officers found Taylor in the doorway with three gunshot wounds to the head. 
</P>
<P>
When Officers Dave Taneman and Mark Rodina rushed down a stairway leading to 
the garage, Bollinger emerged from behind a door and fired once, Nelson said. 
The shot whistled by the two officers and hit Knott, who was standing at the 
top of the stairs covering his fellow officers, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Taneman and Rodina responded with 16 to 18 shots, several of which hit 
Bollinger, killing him, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have considered and rejected several motives, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it was over the condo," Nelson said. "There is no indication of 
a love triangle or narcotics. Some sort of dispute escalated all the way to a 
homicide, but we haven't been able to pin down what caused it." 
</P>
<P>
His colleagues carried Knott outside, laying him on the ground. Several large 
blood stains were still evident Wednesday on a walkway. Surgeons removed a 
.38-caliber slug from Knott's neck Tuesday night, describing him as lucky 
because he showed no signs of paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow officers described Knott as a popular and conscientious police officer 
who has worked in Redondo Beach for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Knott, 40, is married and has three sons. He is a private pilot spends much of 
his free time flying on short excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's jaw was broken by the gunshot and he cannot talk, but friends said he 
is conscious and alert.

PRO-CHINA PAPER CLOSES;

<P>
BOYCOTT OVER STAND ON BEIJING PROTESTS DRAINS AD INCOME

One of the largest Chinese-language newspapers in the United States shut down 
this week because of advertising losses its publisher attributed to a 
passionate boycott in Los Angeles and elsewhere against its pro-Beijing 
editorials. 
</P>
<P>
In a terse, front-page announcement in Monday's issue, executives of the Centre 
Daily News told readers the paper had suffered severe financial losses due to 
an organized effort to undercut its advertising sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We were losing $300,000 a month nationwide," Stephen Fu, 37, the paper's 
publisher and editor said from its Monterey Park office. "The main thing is 
that after the June 4 Tian An Men incident, because our paper supported 
Beijing's conservative faction, that drew opposition from the Chinese 
community." 
</P>
<P>
The paper's offices in Monterey Park, Boston, New York, San Francisco and 
Chicago all closed Saturday, Fu said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newspapers Trampled 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the depth of the local Chinese community's fury at the Centre 
Daily News was evident as early as June, when protesters outside the Chinese 
Consulate in Los Angeles trampled copies of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"Da Dao Zhong Bao!" (Down with the Centre Daily News!) they shouted, venting 
their anger against a newspaper whose editorials supported hard-line Chinese 
leader Deng Xiaoping. Others urged readers and advertisers to boycott the 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, which had averaged 50 pages a day at its height, was forced to run 
as few as 32 pages in recent months, Fu said. The paper also had to run some 
ads free just to fill space, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fu declined to reveal the paper's circulation, and an industry directory, Gale 
Directory of Publications, indicates that the Centre Daily News did not report 
its circulation. 
</P>
<P>
However, a former editor at the paper, widely considered to be the 
second-largest of about six Chinese-language dailies nationwide, said the 
Centre Daily News' circulation was at 50,000 at its best and had recently 
plummeted to less than 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started in New York 
</P>
<P>
Fu said he does not know when the Centre Daily News, which he acknowledged has 
had financial troubles for several years, may be revived. Fu heads the Monterey 
Park office while Ya-tang Fu, his older brother and president of the company, 
is based in New York. Their father, Chau-chu Fu, owns the paper, which started 
in New York in 1982 and opened its Monterey Park office in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the Chinese newspaper industry said they were not surprised by the 
closure because of the paper's past financial troubles and the Chinese-American 
community's intense resentment of the paper's political stance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was going to happen sooner or later," said Cao Changqing, editor of the 
Press Freedom Herald, a pro-democracy Chinese-language paper founded in 
Alhambra after the Beijing crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Cao described Centre Daily News editorials as "absurd" and said he hopes the 
paper has learned that "readers are the people they must serve, not a 
government or a party." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the Chinese community in Southern California viewed the closure as an 
important gain for pro-democracy supporters who have lost the political battle 
in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just happy they are closed," said T. C. Chen, of Ontario. "It's a great 
victory for the pro-democracy movement. The community showed its solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
A former Centre Daily News reporter in Monterey Park said Thursday that readers 
were calling the newsroom to say they were elated to hear the paper was 
shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
But even some critics of the Beijing government said they were sorry the 
Chinese newspaper community has lost a competing voice. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the closure is a pity because I like to read different points 
of view," said San Gabriel resident Wang Hongkai. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perils of Partisanship 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Centre Daily News highlights the perils of political 
partisanship in the highly competitive Chinese newspaper industry. It is a 
business in which headlines, often opinionated and emotional, reflect the 
political bent of the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of the Centre Daily News does not mark the first time a 
Chinese-language newspaper has fallen victim to political sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the China Times closed its San Gabriel office, citing the paper's 
failure to make a profit, said Alan Yi, president of the Chinese Press Assn. of 
Southern California. But others said the paper closed because it lost its 
Taiwan-based financial support after giving Chinese athletes favorable coverage 
at the Los Angeles Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the Hua Qiao Daily, which received its financial support from the 
Chinese government, was forced to close July 31 after its stories criticized 
the handling of the Tian An Men Square demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resignation Announced 
</P>
<P>
The Centre Daily News had tried earlier this year to mitigate the damage 
brought on by the boycott. In the July 5 issue, owner Chau-chu Fu announced 
that he was resigning as chairman of the board and managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, Chau-chu Fu insisted that he was right. "If Beijing and overseas 
protesters had followed my warnings and pleadings, I dare say that there would 
not have been the bloody incident in Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
Even the paper's staff had rebelled. After a May editorial supporting the use 
of military force against Beijing protesters, half the Centre Daily News New 
York staff resigned in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese news sources were so incensed by the paper's editorials that they 
rebuffed reporters, said Min Chen, former executive editor. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the tail of the dog," Chen said, adding that staff members had little 
control over the editorials. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Chen said, the Centre Daily News' local reports written out of 
Monterey Park would contradict front-page articles and editorials composed in 
New York.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL BACKS MAYOR'S PATROL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite criticism from outraged residents of Los Angeles' crime-ridden 
neighborhoods, a City Council panel has voted to back Mayor Tom Bradley's move 
to scale back a police foot-patrol program. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley used a rare veto Friday to halt the council's plans to spend $2.5 
million over the next 10 months to allow the Police Department to use about 60 
officers on overtime at 18 crime "hot spots" around the city. The mayor said 
the appropriation was a "raid on the city's reserve fund" and urged the council 
to support a $750,000 three-month pilot program instead. 
</P>
<P>
This week the council's Budget and Finance Committee voted to sustain the 
mayor's veto and approved the pilot program, recommending that the funds come 
from the department's $1.3-million surplus from positions that were budgeted 
but not filled. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief Jesse Brewer said the department supported the 
committee's action but would have preferred that salary savings not be used. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will go to the full City Council for a vote. The date of the vote 
has not been scheduled.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBINS URGED TO QUIT ELKS LODGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley called Wednesday for state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) to 
send a "powerful message" against racism by resigning immediately from the Van 
Nuys Elks Lodge, which voted for the second time Tuesday to reject membership 
applications from two black men. 
</P>
<P>
But Robbins, who sponsored Jules S. Bagneris III and Thomas J. Montgomery for 
membership, said he will continue trying to win acceptance for the two men to 
the white-dominated organization. "I'm not going to walk away and concede the 
fight to those who would treat Mr. Bagneris and Mr. Montgomery unfairly," 
Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge does not reveal the results of membership votes, but sources involved 
in Tuesday's election said the turnout of 53 members voted 34 to 19 to admit 
the men, just two votes short of the two-thirds necessary for admission. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Robbins, Bradley said: "It seems to me your only moral 
alternative is to submit your resignation . . . the most powerful message you 
can send." 
</P>
<P>
But Bagneris said he wants Robbins to remain in the lodge and fight for his 
admission.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KIDNAP VICTIM FREED; 3 SUSPECTS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police freed a kidnaping victim Wednesday and arrested three suspects after a 
high-speed chase through the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell S. Shumahine, 33, of Los Angeles was rescued, shaken but unharmed, from 
a car that was pulled over by police in Granada Hills shortly after 1 a.m., Los 
Angeles Police Department Lt. Ron Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Feliciano, 28, and Lisa Parry, 23, both of Van Nuys, and Eugene Cumba, 
39, of Los Angeles were arrested on suspicion of kidnaping for ransom. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the motive for the abduction appeared to be rooted in a business 
dispute between Shumahine and an acquaintance of the suspects. Shumahine owns 
an auto-body repair shop in the Mid-Wilshire District that is facing financial 
difficulties, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspects believed he owed money" to an individual whom police did not 
identify and "they were going to get it for him," Lewis said. Shumahine's 
girlfriend had received calls from his captors demanding $60,000 ransom, police 
said.

POLIO VICTIM CLAIMS BIAS BY RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A polio victim filed suit Wednesday against the owners of a Boyle Heights 
restaurant claiming that his civil rights were violated when employees 
allegedly refused to serve him a beer because he is disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Adolfo Pena, 26, who uses crutches to walk, also claimed in his suit that 
security guards at the three-restaurant complex inside El Mercado de Los 
Angeles shopping center roughed him up and took away his crutches, causing him 
to fall, after he refused to pay his $16 bill and walked outside to call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told the restaurant had a policy not to serve to invalidos," Pena said, 
using the Spanish word for crippled. "I was embarrassed and humiliated because 
everyone in the restaurant heard (the dispute). ... Nothing like this has ever 
happened to me before." 
</P>
<P>
Pena's attorney, Gloria Allred, called the alleged policies at La Perla, El 
Gallo, and El Terasco restaurants inside the mall "callous, unacceptable and 
unlawful." The Los Angeles Superior Court civil suit seeks a change in 
restaurant practices and unspecified monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro M. Rosado, the shopping center and restaurant owner, was unavailable to 
comment. But his wife, Mercedes, denied that such a policy existed and said she 
was unaware of the Aug. 5 incident involving Pena. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time we deny service is when some one has had too much to drink," she 
told reporters. "We don't refuse to serve because someone is crippled." 
</P>
<P>
Pena, who works in admissions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Los 
Angeles, told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Pena said he and a friend were drawn to the restaurant by afternoon mariachi 
music and slipped into a booth. Pena said he pushed his crutches beneath the 
table, and they were hidden from view. The pair then ordered two beers and 
food. During the meal, Pena said, he moved his aluminum crutches, leaning them 
upright against the booth where they were in public view. 
</P>
<P>
"When I ordered a second beer the waitress told me it wasn't their policy to 
serve crippled people because we might be on medication," Pena told a press 
conference Wednesday in front of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Pena said he became enraged and refused to pay the bill. He said he demanded to 
speak to the owner and asked the waitress to call police. After waiting a half 
hour with no response, Pena said he stepped outside to call police himself. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that security guards stopped him, took away his crutches and "threw 
me in an elevator like a bag of potatoes," he said. Pena said he was taken to 
an office and, while waiting for police to arrive, the guards taunted him and 
played with his crutches, pretending they were handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"The police told me to pay my bill and hire an lawyer," he said.

RAIDER LINEBACKERS STILL AREN'T SURE WHETHER THEY'RE COMING OR GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Week 3, you might like to think the Raiders are settling down, but that's 
not possible just yet. Instead, they're holding an open call at linebacker, 
where in the space of 36 hours they brought in three and cut two. 
</P>
<P>
In an upset, none of them was Otis Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
For those of you struggling to keep your programs updated, here's the latest 
flash. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving: Linden King. The veteran outside linebacker was waived in the first 
cut in camp but re-signed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving: Joe Costello. The Plan B free agent from Atlanta was waived in the 
first cut, re-signed before the opener and waived again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving and leaving: Darin Jordan. Waived by the Pittsburgh Steelers, he tried 
out Tuesday, was signed . . . and then waived. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe? Rickey Hunley. The former Denver Bronco and Phoenix Cardinal worked out 
Wednesday and was sent to take a physical. 
</P>
<P>
Do these -- and the seven previous moves the club has made at the position -- 
suggest a certain organizational indecision? 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Shanahan said the team needed a better and more experienced backup 
to Emanuel King, who has just taken over Wilson's old spot. Hence the cuts of 
Costello and Jordan and the signing of Linden King. The Hunley tryout was 
represented as a routine look at a veteran, should the need for one arise. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned, too, if a need arises in the next day or so. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line," Shanahan said, " . . . people say, 'You're giving up a few 
points, a lot of yards.' And that's true. Any time you lose someone like Howie 
Long, Scott Davis, Jerry Robinson, Russell Carter, Stacey Toran unfortunately, 
you have to make some adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we're going to look at who's out there who can help us." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the toll of the missing linemen and safeties would be, someone was 
going to play linebacker and those decisions were supposed to be made in camp. 
The Raiders started the season with their entire five-man cadre of Group B 
free-agent linebackers plus a single holdover, Robinson, and a converted end, 
Greg Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
Since, they have made five moves at outside linebacker, where Robinson's injury 
isn't a factor. They have brought back two players -- Linden King and Costello 
-- who were axed in the first cut, when the squad was trimmed to 60. 
</P>
<P>
King was known as a run defender and the Raiders have allowed 161 yards rushing 
a game this season. He was located lolling on the beach in Honolulu, where he 
went to consider retirement after being waived at 34. 
</P>
<P>
"I got up Sunday morning to watch the cartoons with my son," King said. "I 
turned on the game and saw the Raiders at Kansas City. The next morning I got a 
call from George (Karras, Raider scout), asking if I really wanted to retire or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting bored sitting around," King said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"I had geared myself for one more year before I quit. I was kind of 
disappointed when I was let go. I really didn't get a chance to do much. 
</P>
<P>
"When you bring in a bunch of people, you have to give them a chance to play. 
During preseason, Matt (Millen, also waived) and I didn't get a chance to play. 
That wasn't the way I wanted to go out because I knew I could play. This is a 
second chance. 
</P>
<P>
"(Getting cut) is part of football. Personally, I was a little . . . 
disappointed but Mr. (Al) Davis has always been fair with me. He gave me a 
chance when I came out of San Diego, when the rap on me was I couldn't play 
anymore. I couldn't be bitter. I wished it had turned out differently but you 
gotta take what you get." 
</P>
<P>
Let the Raiders tell you about it. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to be helpful, Raider writers compiled a list of other available 
ex-Raider linebackers: Rod Martin, Brad Van Pelt, Jeff Barnes, Bob Nelson, Jack 
Squirek, Erwin (Magic) Grabisna, Phil Villapiano, Dan Connors. 
</P>
<P>
Millen has signed with the San Francisco 49ers, so if they want him back, 
they'll have to deal. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Robinson and Howie Long didn't practice, and despite their listings -- 
probable for Long, questionable for Robinson -- neither is likely to play at 
Denver. . . . Long, shot up with painkillers to play, aggravated his sprained 
ankle at Kansas City and is walking with a bad limp. Robinson re-pulled his 
groin while working out before the Chief game and is probably behind where he 
was a week ago. . . . Bill Lewis took a sweat shirt that said "Trader Sports," 
taped over the second word and last letter of the first word, giving him one 
that said "Trade," and wore it around the facility.

To answer the first question that just about everybody asks him, Elvis Grbac 
was not named after the king of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was his brother named after Engelbert Humperdinck. 
</P>
<P>
Elvis and Engelbert are just common names in Yugoslavia, says a bemused Grbac, 
whose parents emigrated to the Midwest 20 years ago not from Las Vegas, but 
from the Alpine village of Istra near the Italian border. 
</P>
<P>
As far back as he can remember, however, Grbac has been asked about his given 
name. And his last name, too, which is pronounced GER-back here but was 
GER-botch in the old country. 
</P>
<P>
The questions began anew last Saturday, when the 6-foot-5, 220-pound freshman 
replaced injured starter Michael Taylor as Michigan's quarterback in a 
nationally televised game against No. 1-ranked Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
On the third play of the second half, Taylor got stung, hit from behind by 
Notre Dame linebacker Ned Bolcar. Taylor's back was badly bruised. 
</P>
<P>
On the sideline, Grbac admitted to being nervous, but he wasn't exactly all 
shook up. 
</P>
<P>
He went into the game and almost rallied the Wolverines to a comeback victory, 
establishing a school percentage record by completing 17 of 21 passes for 134 
yards and two touchdowns in a 24-19 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the jitters out early," said Grbac, who missed on his first two passes. 
</P>
<P>
He hit his third pass to Greg McMurtry over the middle for 19 yards and "after 
that I just started rolling." 
</P>
<P>
Elvis, who completed 16 of his last 17 passes, drew rave reviews, even from 
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz. 
</P>
<P>
"He really got some things going, made some great throws," Holtz said. "He's 
got a great future." 
</P>
<P>
The future starts this week. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is still hurting and Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler, impressed as much 
by Grbac's moxie and field presence as his powerful right arm, announced that 
Grbac would start Saturday night against UCLA in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
All this has happened a little sooner than Grbac expected. 
</P>
<P>
Over dinner Monday night in the South Quad dormitory, Grbac explained to a 
group of reporters that he didn't play football at Cleveland's St. Joseph High 
School until after a coach saw him throw during a freshman gym class and 
suggested that he try out as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Grbac, 19, was a varsity starter for only one season at St. Joseph, throwing 
for about 900 yards and 15 touchdowns as a senior in a run-oriented offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The most I threw was 15 passes in a game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grbac visited only two schools, Michigan and Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State, located in the same town as Presley's Graceland estate, 
obviously missed a public relations coup. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of other schools might have missed out on a rising star. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Moeller, a Michigan assistant, liked the way Grbac threw and the way he 
moved on the basketball court, Schembechler said. A forward, Grbac was a 
two-year varsity starter in basketball and was recruited by Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball, in fact, was his first love, but the constant pounding on his 
ankles left him unable to walk after games. 
</P>
<P>
So, he turned to football. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan coaching staff met him and liked him, but it was mostly because of 
Grbac's size that they offered him a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would take a while, but we knew there was something there," 
Schembechler said. "So, we took a chance on him." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler liked what he saw in the Notre Dame game. 
</P>
<P>
"He stands right in there and looks them in the face," Schembechler said. "You 
can't imagine the advantage, if you're going to pass, of being 6-feet-5. You 
can stay in there a lot longer and look over the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Grbac looked over defenses all last summer, spending two and three hours a day 
in Moeller's office. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in passing drills, "everything started clicking," he said. "I just 
started picking people apart." 
</P>
<P>
He did the same to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Several teammates marveled at the freshman's poise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they expected me to be really nervous," Grbac said. "But when I got 
out there, I wanted to be cool and calm and let things happen. Our offense is 
very good and we can do a lot of things. If something messed up, I went right 
to the next play and kept right on going." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Grbac wouldn't have made it sound so simple. 
</P>
<P>
He had no illusions when he left his home in Willoughby Hills, Ohio, and 
enrolled last fall at Michigan. At least four quarterbacks were ahead of him, 
including Demetrius Brown, the Wolverines' starter last January in their 22-14 
victory over USC in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to do anything for three or four years except grow into a 
college quarterback and learn about defenses," Grbac said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, this Elvis' most prominent role before last week was that of an 
impersonator. He duplicated the moves of USC's Rodney Peete in Michigan's 
preparations for the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, however, flunked out of school last summer and, in fall practice, Grbac 
moved ahead of a more heralded pair of sophomores, former high school 
All-American Wilbur Odom of San Antonio and Ken Sollom, a former All-Southern 
Section selection from Canyon High in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, Taylor was injured last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said that he will simplify the offense this week, putting more of 
an emphasis on the Wolverines' running game, which was expected to be strong 
but produced only 94 yards against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to put that kind of pressure on Elvis and make him try to master 
all the offense," Schembechler said. 
</P>
<P>
All indications, however, are that he probably could handle it. 
</P>
<P>
His name alone has kept him in the spotlight all his life.

ANGELS WIN BUT LOSE A LITTLE TIME; 
</P>
<P>
ABBOTT PITCHES A 9-1 VICTORY THAT DOESN'T CLOSE GAP ON OAKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MINNEAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you think the Angels cleaned up at the Metrodome the last three days? 
</P>
<P>
Well, let's see . . . 
</P>
<P>
They swept the Minnesota Twins, Wednesday's 9-1 victory their third in as many 
nights under the Teflon sky. 
</P>
<P>
They also outscored the Twins, 22-7. Outhit them, too, 37-22. 
</P>
<P>
So why did the Angels leave the Twin Cities in worse shape than when they 
arrived last Sunday night? 
</P>
<P>
Time. 
</P>
<P>
It's on the side of the Oakland Athletics, and as long the A's keeping matching 
the Angels victory for victory and sweep for sweep, winning can be tantamount 
to losing for the Angels the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, the calendar's against us," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "We 
knew a week, 10 days ago that we'd have to play .750 ball and Oakland .500 ball 
if we were going to catch them. 
</P>
<P>
"We closed to within 2 1/2 (games), but then they started winning again. We're 
not getting closer because they're playing better. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day that goes by like that certainly doesn't work in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels left Minnesota with the same 2 1/2-game deficit in the American 
League West standings that they lugged with them from Chicago. One difference, 
though: They now have three fewer days in which to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
By winning three consecutive games in Cleveland, Oakland sliced its magic 
number from 12 to nine, regardless of the heavy Angel damage done inside the 
Dome. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the A's and Angels swap opponents, with the Angels traveling to 
Cleveland hoping the Twins can succeed against Oakland where they failed these 
past three nights. 
</P>
<P>
"I already had a talk with Kirby (Puckett)," Angel center fielder Devon White 
said with a grin. "I told him they've got to sweep those guys for us." 
</P>
<P>
Puckett assured White the Twins would do their best. 
</P>
<P>
But considering the current state of Minnesota pitching, the Angels ought not 
to expect much. Mark Guthrie, the third rookie to start against the Angels this 
series, fared better than those who went before him, David West and Kevin 
Tapani. But all that meant was delaying the pounding this time until the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie and that better-known rookie named Jim Abbott were stalemated at 1-1 
through six innings before the top of the seventh saw Guthrie pitch to five 
batters and fail to get any of them out. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner led off with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis reached base on an error by Terry Jorgensen, the Twins' rookie 
third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Armas, disdaining the apparent sacrifice bunt, singled to left field to 
score Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish walked, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Howell was hit by a pitch, this time for certain, to force home Davis and 
force Guthrie out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
By the time former Angel Mike Cook could close out the inning for Minnesota, 
Kent Anderson had singled in Armas, Brian Downing had scored Parrish with a 
sacrifice fly and the Angels led, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Run-scoring singles by Armas and Parrish made in 7-1 in the eighth and a 
two-run home run by Joyner, his 16th, made it 9-1 in the top of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Three outs later, Abbott (12-11) had his fourth complete game of the year and 
his first victory in September. 
</P>
<P>
At last, a contribution to the Angel stretch drive. Abbott was asked how it 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I thought there'd be a little more pressure than this," Abbott said. 
"I'm not saying there's no pressure. I'm not downplaying it. I guess I thought 
every game would feel like it's do or die." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching with 9-1 leads can do that for a 22-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
So can pitching for a team that occupied itself during Wednesday's game by 
watching Bert Blyleven quietly squirt shaving cream atop the cap of an 
unsuspecting Chuck Finley, mug for the scoreboard camera that caught him in the 
act and finally turn the aerosol can on himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a loose team," Abbott said. "Doug's made it that way. There's no 
intense pressure either in the clubhouse or on the field, so it's easy not to 
be tight. All I do is concentrate on my own pitching." 
</P>
<P>
In the visiting manager's office, Rader threw a few good words of his own in 
Abbott's direction. 
</P>
<P>
"A pennant race doesn't make a person," Rader said. "The person's already 
prepared for it, or unprepared for it, from an emotional standpoint. You either 
have it or you don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbie's had it from day one. If he didn't, he would not have made the club 
this spring." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Abbott has been through worse before. This time last year, he was 
representing an entire country while pitching the United States to an Olympic 
gold medal in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt more pressure there, in the gold-medal game," Abbott said. "That game 
was do or die. That was it. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, although each of these games are vital, we'd still have a chance by 
7 o'clock tomorrow night if we lost this one tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily a good one, but, yes, still a chance. And although that chance 
didn't improve any despite a sweep in Minnesota, it's all the Angels have as 
they move on to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday, Jim Abbott was 1-4 in seven starts since Aug. 6, clearly 
fading under the fatigue of his first big-league season. "We weren't concerned 
this would happen this year," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "It was reality. 
Inevitable. It was going to happen. And it did." Convincing Abbott of the fact, 
however, took some doing. "Some of the older guys came up to me and asked, 'Are 
you tired?' " Abbott said. "I'd always tell them, no, that I was just trying 
too hard. But that's a part of being tired. You have to admit when you are 
tired and realize you can't do the same things as you did in April. You just 
have to concentrate more and adjust." 
</P>
<P>
Add Abbott: He concedes that the losing was beginning to eat away at him. 
"There have been some times when I'd go back to my apartment or my hotel room 
and think, 'What am I doing? I'm doing my best and I'm not even coming close.' 
" Part of the remedy, Abbott said, came when Rader began granting him extra 
days here and there between starts. Abbott went a week between starts in late 
August and was given five days off between his second and third starts of 
September. Wednesday was his fourth start of the month. "The rest has really 
helped," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
The best deliveries Minnesota starter Mark Guthrie (2-2) made all night were to 
first base. Guthrie tied a club record by picking off two runners Wednesday, 
erasing Mark McLemore in the fourth inning and Jack Howell in the fifth. The 
last Twin pitcher to pickoff off two runners in a game was Steve Carlton on 
Sept. 6, 1987. . . . A 10-year-old boy was taken from the Metrodome stands on a 
stretcher after being hit in the head by a foul ball off the bat off 
Minnesota's John Moses. Nicholas Johnson of Stillwater, Minn., was taken to 
nearby Hennepin Medical Center, where he received several stitches in his 
forehead and underwent neurological testing. Johnson wound up with a bad bruise 
and was later released.

MORNING BRIEFING: INSIDE INFORMATION GOES A LONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever wish you could call the shots at a sporting event? 
</P>
<P>
In "The Winning Horseplayer," a book by the Washington Post's Andrew Beyer, 
racing expert Paul Cornman describes what happened after he noticed a track 
bias at Hialeah that favored front-runners on the rail. Only the names have 
been changed: 
</P>
<P>
" 'I liked a horse named Sib's Future, who had some speed and had the ability 
to get the lead on the rail. But the jockey was Brian Long and he had shown 
through his riding that he didn't understand the track. I wanted to tell him 
but I knew I couldn't yell at him or I'd just sound like another one of the 
irate fanatics. So when he was going out to the track from the paddock I said 
as calmly as possible, 'Every winner has been on the inside. You're 20 to 1, 
but if you hustle to the rail you'll win.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Long hustled, got Sib's Future to the rail and led all the way, returning a 
$43.20 payoff that got Paul out of the doldrums. As Long walked back to the 
jockey's room he gave Paul a little nod, as if to acknowledge that he 
appreciated the advice." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What countries have won the most World Cup soccer titles? 
</P>
<P>
Ode-ious: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post on the start of the Redskins' 
season: 
</P>
<P>
 First it's the Giants on a long field goal, 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's the Eagles in a game they stole. 
</P>
<P>
 Who'd have predicted without real malice, 
</P>
<P>
 The Skins 0-2 heading into Dallas? 
</P>
<P>
 I know you thought nothing could be finer, 
</P>
<P>
 Than to hand off the ball to Riggs and Byner. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Gerald's the gaining-est back around, 
</P>
<P>
 He's gotta stop laying the ball on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could be worse, all could be dross. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skins could be coached by Bobby Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Add Redskins: Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun reports that Redskin 
quarterback Mark Rypien and his wife were invited to dinner at the home of Vice 
President Dan Quayle Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was that Rypien wasn't feeling sociable after the Redskins 
blew a 20-point lead in losing to the Philadelphia Eagles, 42-37. 
</P>
<P>
Because he didn't know how to get in touch with Quayle's press secretary after 
the game, Rypien and his wife simply didn't show up for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I left him hanging," Rypien said. He said his wife called Quayle's 
secretary Monday to explain what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled criticism: Paul Moran of Newsday, on Easy Goer's victory in the 
Woodward Stakes Saturday: "Not since Easy Goer's overpowering victory in the 
Belmont, which followed severe and justified criticism of (Pat) Day's judgment 
during his ride in the Preakness, has the sensational chestnut 3-year-old been 
handled in a style complementary to his ability." 
</P>
<P>
Add Moran: It appears that Easy Goer may race again before the Breeders' Cup at 
Gulfstream Park Nov. 4. Said trainer Shug McGaughey: "I'm more inclined to run 
now than I was before (the Woodward). For one thing, I've had more time to 
think about it. And I thought that the Gold Cup was three weeks before the 
Breeders' Cup, but it's actually four." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Brazil and Italy each has won three. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: After quarterback Joe Montana patiently waited for Jerry Rice to get 
open for a 58-yard touchdown pass that gave the San Francisco 49ers a 
season-opening 30-24 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, radio commentator and 
former all-pro linebacker Wayne Walker said: "Montana was as cool as the other 
side of the pillow." GARR KLUENDER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
CARDINALS TRAIL BY 3 AFTER WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The St. Louis Cardinals, after pulling to within a half game of the Chicago 
Cubs in the East Sept. 8, went into a slump -- they fell six games behind in a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
And when they started talking about closing to within three games again, many 
figured they were overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals were hoping to be close enough to challenge for the pennant when 
they played host to the Cubs in a three-game series to conclude the season. 
</P>
<P>
Now, St. Louis has reached its goal early. 
</P>
<P>
After John Morris and Milt Thompson each drove in two runs in a 5-3 victory 
over the New York Mets Wednesday night at St. Louis, they trail the Cubs by 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, a team in turmoil, are 5 1/2 back with only 11 games left. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Whitey Herzog used his bullpen judicially after the Cardinals scored 
all their runs off Dave Cone (13-8) in the first two innings. 
</P>
<P>
Five relief pitchers held the Mets scoreless in the last 6 2/3 innings. Frank 
DiPino (8-8) was the winner. Ken Dayley got his 12th save. He ended the game by 
getting Darryl Strawberry on a routine fly with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds returned to the Mets' lineup and were a 
combined zero for eight. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 3, Cincinnati 1 -- Jack Clark scored the winning run in the 10th 
inning at Cincinnati when third baseman Luis Quinones made a throwing error, 
and the Padres kept the pressure on the Giants in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have won 23 of their last 29 games and the Reds have lost nine in a 
row and are assured of finishing below .500 for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis pitched the 10th for his 41st save in 45 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 7, Atlanta 6 -- In dramatic fashion, the Astros kept their faint hopes 
alive in the West at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bass hit a grand slam in the seventh to tie the game and Alex Trevino won 
it with his second home run. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 9, Montreal 1 -- It's too late to make a difference, but for the 
past few weeks, the Pirates have been the best team in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla hit a three-run home run in the first inning at Pittsburgh to 
lead the rout of the Expos. The Pirates have knocked around all four teams 
ahead of them in recent series. DAN HAFNER

CUBS BLOWN A BIT OFF COURSE IN LOSS TO PHILLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is one thing for certain when the wind is blowing out at Wrigley Field: 
Runs will be scored in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
With a big breeze Wednesday at Chicago, neither starting pitcher made it 
through the third inning and the Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies were tied, 7-7, 
after four. 
</P>
<P>
In a game featuring 36 hits and 11 pitchers, the Phillies slowed the Cubs' 
drive to the National League East title with a 9-8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
With the St. Louis Cardinals defeating the New York Mets, 5-3, the Cubs' lead 
over the Cardinals was cut to three games. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hayes drove in four runs for the Phillies and Ricky Jordan singled home the 
tie-breaking run in the sixth inning. It was similar to an Aug. 10 game, again 
in high wind, when the Phillies outlasted the Cubs, 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Don Zimmer was so upset he held a 30-minute clubhouse meeting. Although 
he refused to talk about the meeting, Zimmer said he was concerned because his 
pitchers have been giving up too many runs. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer seems to be getting a little testy. "Can't I hold a meeting without the 
whole world knowing about it?" he asked. "I'm not saying one word about it." 
</P>
<P>
Don Carman, a 15-game loser as a starter, gave up three hits and three walks, 
but no runs in 2 2/3 innings to get his fifth victory. 
</P>
<P>
The wind wasn't blowing directly out, it seemed to be merely blowing the ball 
away from fielders. Hayes hit the only home run, his 24th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia rookie Pat Combs pitched well in two previous outings under normal 
conditions, but allowed four runs and nine hits in 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sutcliffe of the Cubs, seeking his 16th victory, gave up six hits and four 
runs in 1 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ryne Sandberg drove in a run with his fourth hit of the game to get the Cubs 
close in the ninth. With runners on first and second, Roger McDowell got Mark 
Grace to bounce into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Daulton of the Phillies went five for five and did not score a run or 
drive one in. DAN HAFNER

LPGA TOURNAMENT AT BUENA PARK; 
</P>
<P>
PATCHY GREENS SHOULD MAKE THE GOING ROUGH

They will be playing in a city known for its amusement park, but when the 
Ladies Professional Golf Assn. returns to Orange County today, the players will 
find the course at Buena Park anything but amusing. 
</P>
<P>
The field in this 72-hole event, called the Nippon Travel -- MBS tournament, 
will be strong, but even the most skilled players on the tour will be tested at 
Los Coyotes Country Club, a shapely patch of nature three miles from Knotts 
Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
The course, at 6,350 yards, is longer than the usual LPGA layout. Of the 33 
courses on the tour's schedule, only 11 play longer than 6,300. But distance 
alone is not what will make Los Coyotes challenging. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the summer a fungus got into the greens and ate away the grass 
roots, leaving bare patches scattered around the putting surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the persistent efforts of the greenskeeper to rebuild and strengthen 
the weakened parts of the turf, some blotches remain, although the greens are 
now reasonably playable, according to the LPGA's on-site official, Jim Haley. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a lot better than they were five weeks ago, and they should improve 
each day," Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
The players are coming off consecutive weeks in which they putted on fast 
greens. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week's greens (in Seattle) were so fast and so smooth, it's going to take 
a couple of days to get a feel for these," Pat Bradley, one of the tournament 
favorites, said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some rough spots and the ball is not going to roll true all the 
time, I don't feel. As putts start to die at the hole, they will start to 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
Scores were high the last time an LPGA event was played at Los Coyotes. In 
1971, when Kathy Whitworth, Sandra Haynie and Sandra Palmer were the leading 
economic indicators of women's golf, Whitworth won the Suzuki Internationale 
with a three-round score that was one over par. There were only three over-par 
victories in 21 tournaments that year. 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth, who is entered this week, is admittedly not playing well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do well to make the (36-hole) cut," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth says the long hitters -- Bradley, Nancy Lopez and Beth Daniel -- will 
have an upper hand on this course, and she favors Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy is a very good slow-greens putter," Whitworth said. "She hits long 
enough and is a good front-runner." 
</P>
<P>
That will be important this week. The finishing holes are not set up for 
come-from-behind heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, this season's third-leading money winner and last year's player of the 
year, has won twice this year, the LPGA Championship and the Atlantic City 
tournament, and is seeking her fourth Vare Trophy, the award given for the 
lowest scoring average. With a 70.77 average, Lopez is in third place but is 
close enough to remain motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez also has handled the greens here well in practice, unlike in Seattle 
where she was on medication for a thyroid condition and finished tied for 39th. 
</P>
<P>
"I made more putts on these greens today than I did last week," she said 
Wednesday. "The ball is rolling real well." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bradley: "I think Nancy has really been a much stronger factor when the 
greens haven't been to everyone else's liking." 
</P>
<P>
The nines have been reversed for the tournament, which poses another difficulty 
for the players. The four finishing holes are all par fours, none are easy 
birdie holes, and two of them, No. 15 at 394 yards, and No. 17 at 384, loom as 
bogey holes. 
</P>
<P>
This won't be the players' only shot at Los Coyotes. The LPGA, which last 
played in Orange County two years ago at Mesa Verde Country Club, has a 
three-year contract with the Buena Park club.

GRIFFITH JOYNER DENIES BUYING GROWTH HORMONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West German news magazine in Wednesday's editions quoted American 400-meter 
runner Darrell Robinson as saying he sold human growth hormone to Florence 
Griffith Joyner in March of 1988, about six months before she won three gold 
medals at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Human growth hormone, banned by the International Olympic Committee, is used to 
stimulate muscle growth. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine, Stern, published a lengthy cover story entitled, "Doping 
Scandal," in which Robinson, a former junior world record-holder, told of drug 
use by himself and others. 
</P>
<P>
The article quotes Robinson as saying he often discussed drugs with Griffith 
Joyner, who competed with him on the World Class Track Club, which trained at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who has retired from track, denies the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who was paid by the magazine for his information, was quoted as 
saying that Griffith Joyner asked him about HGH. The article said that Robinson 
told her it was expensive but she replied, "If you want to make a million 
dollars, you've got to invest some thousand dollars." 
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine, Robinson said Griffith Joyner gave him 20 $100-bills 
and said, "Get it." Robinson said in the article that he put a bottle 
containing 10 cubic centimeters of HGH in Griffith Joyner's track bag and that 
she acknowledged the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who is scheduled to appear with Robinson this morning on "The 
Today Show," said she is shocked at the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, to me, it was funny," she said. "I thought I was reading one of 
those tabloids. I'm shocked at some of the things he said." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner said she might have listened as Robinson talked about drugs but 
she showed no interest in such discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to say I was curious about drugs is totally false," she said. "I'd be 
a stone fool to have discussed drugs with anyone, since I don't believe in 
them. Much less someone I didn't know that well. I didn't even have $2,000 at 
the time. Everybody who comes to a track has a bag for their spikes. I never 
left my bag so somebody could mess with it." 
</P>
<P>
Stern is the largest news weekly in Europe with a circulation of 1.4 million. 
The article, compiled by three reporters, quotes Robinson as alleging drug 
involvement by Carl Lewis, Houston track coach Tom Tellez and local coaches Bob 
Kersee and Chuck DeBus. Robinson was reportedly paid $100,000 by the magazine 
for a three-day series of interviews. The magazine did not carry any response 
from those accused. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner said the story is just another in a series of allegations that 
helped persuade her to leave the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even find the words," she said. "I don't expect to stop hearing it. 
People are trying to make money. I've never been surprised by what people will 
do for money. Darrell can run but he can't hide. If he was man enough to tell 
Stern this, he can be man enough to tell a woman to her face about it. I can 
only pray for him." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner said she will take any legal action open to her. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to draw the line somewhere," she said. "I regret not taking action 
before on these allegations. I'm going to do everything in my power."

JOURNEY TO CALCUTTA: THE DOCTORING OF MOTHER TERESA 
</P>

CALCUTTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the phone rang in his Upper Eastside Manhattan apartment on the afternoon 
of Sept. 9, there had been nothing all that special about Dr. George Lombardi's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
At 33, he had built up a respectable medical practice, specializing in tropical 
diseases at New York Hospital's Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many of his contemporaries, he had dabbled in "good causes" in the 
1970s, having rejected a Princeton scholarship to spend his undergraduate years 
at the City College of New York, principally to help out in the Harlem ghetto 
surrounding the campus. 
</P>
<P>
And there were those seven months he spent in eastern Kenya in 1984, doing some 
key research that led to effective treatment of schistosomiasis, a disease that 
at the time afflicted 80% of the natives in the region. 
</P>
<P>
But the late '80s came, and Lombardi had largely given up on idealistic notions 
of changing the world. Maybe the world didn't really want to change, he 
figured. So he settled into his practice and a relatively anonymous life 
devoted to his patients, his wife, his two children and the prospect of a 
future with few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the phone call. 
</P>
<P>
The voice on the other end said simply that there was an elderly woman who was 
gravely ill and needed his help. But it was hardly a typical patient referral. 
</P>
<P>
The ailing woman was Mother Teresa, the universally acclaimed Nobel Peace 
laureate and champion of the world's poor. And the caller was one of her most 
loyal benefactors in America. 
</P>
<P>
"She said Mother Teresa was very ill and that they had almost lost her the 
previous night," Lombardi recalled this week. "The benefactress said a 
colleague of mine had referred her to me as a specialist in infectious 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"Then she told me that Mother Teresa had been admitted to a hospital in 
Calcutta with a very high fever, nausea and vomiting blood, and that her 
doctors could not identify the infection. Finally, she asked if I would be 
willing to talk to her doctors and help out. 
</P>
<P>
"What was I going to say -- no?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flurry of Phone Calls 
</P>
<P>
So began the flurry of international telephone calls and the series of unlikely 
events that, within 24 hours, put the soft-spoken doctor halfway around the 
world, in Calcutta, at Mother Teresa's bedside. 
</P>
<P>
His mission: to help save a woman considered by many throughout the world to be 
a living saint. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think about it like that, you can be paralyzed," Lombardi said Tuesday 
night as he began his long journey home aboard an Indian Airlines passenger jet 
after 10 days he will not soon forget. "And you really don't think about it in 
that way. I was asked to contribute, and I think I did contribute. And now it's 
time for me to get back to my patients, my family and my life." 
</P>
<P>
It is not, of course, quite that simple. 
</P>
<P>
During those 10 days, Lombardi contributed in ways that the unassuming doctor 
clearly would prefer not to acknowledge. Although Mother Teresa remains 
bedridden in a Calcutta hospital with a weak heart, even his Indian 
counterparts acknowledge that Lombardi's presence was crucial in identifying 
and defeating the infection that was bringing the champion of charity nearer to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi recalled that he had to navigate several serious obstacles to reach 
her bedside. 
</P>
<P>
The first one was bureaucratic, and it came even before he left for India. He 
had no passport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strings Pulled, Doors Opened 
</P>
<P>
"I called the State Department duty officer in New York, and he said it would 
be impossible to get one until Monday morning," Lombardi recalled. "I called 
back the benefactress, Mrs. Jan Petri, and she said not to worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"At 6 o'clock the next morning, which was Sunday, they opened up the passport 
office at Rockefeller Center to give me a passport. It's unbelieveable, the 
reach of Mother Teresa and her work. 
</P>
<P>
"At 7 a.m., they opened up the Indian consulate to give me a visa. . . . There 
were six or eight people waiting there for us. And, as I was leaving, they were 
telling me, Mother Teresa is a god. She is a saint. And, at that point, I got a 
little nervous. I mean, she's 79, after all, and I didn't want to get 
everybody's hopes up." 
</P>
<P>
The second hurdle came 24 hours later, when he arrived at Woodland's Nursing 
Home, Calcutta's only state-of-the-art hospital. He knew he had to win the 
confidence of the other members of Mother Teresa's medical team, even though he 
had taken pains to consult each one of them before he left America to make sure 
they actually did want his help. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At First, Tension 
</P>
<P>
"It's always kind of tense in the beginning," Lombardi said. "You're asking 
yourself, 'Are these guys incompetent? Do they think I'm incompetent? Who's on 
first? Who's on second?' That kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing they asked was what I thought was wrong with her. I felt it 
was kind of a test. I said, 'I'd like to examine her first,' and they agreed." 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi then opened the sliding glass door to Mother Teresa's air-conditioned 
room in the hospital's intensive-care unit and met for the first time the woman 
about whom all he had previously known was that "she won the Nobel Peace Prize, 
she lived in India and that she had dedicated her life to helping the poor." 
</P>
<P>
He went through the standard questions and a thorough examination. 
</P>
<P>
"I do remember that the first thing she said to me was, 'Dr. Lombardi, I will 
not leave Calcutta until I'm well, and there should be no differences of 
opinion about my medical care between you and the Indian doctors.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disagreement Arose 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, though, there was, and in that initial disagreement was the last 
and most crucial hurdle. After several days of treating Mother Teresa with 
general antibiotics and observing her worsening condition, Lombardi concluded 
that the infection causing her rising fever was coming from a wire catheter 
that had been inserted in her left arm and attached to an external heart 
pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
The pacemaker was merely a precaution. It had never been turned on. And such 
infections are not uncommon, even in Western hospitals. But Mother Teresa's 
cardiologists were afraid to remove it because it would be vital to her 
survival if she went into heart failure, as she had within hours of her 
admission to the hospital Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"In every other way, the doctors were giving her the best of care," Lombardi 
stressed. "All the cultures I would have taken had been obtained. All the 
blood, stool and urine samples and even abdominal ultrasound had been done." 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi had deliberately proceeded slowly and cautiously with his colleagues, 
always trying to avoid even the slightest offense or disagreement. Finally, 
though, when five days had gone by and the cardiologists still resisted 
removing the pacemaker, he made his firmest appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Did Not Want to See It' 
</P>
<P>
"I made a presentation showing that ever since the (pacemaker) line had been 
inserted, her temperature had gone up daily and her white blood count had gone 
down," he recalled. "I was telling them the obvious, but they just did not want 
to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"They were still very nervous about taking the pacemaker out, and that's when a 
little politics came into play. I felt I had an obligation to Mother Teresa 
and, in my heart of hearts, I felt that I knew what the right thing to do was. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'We've been together for five days. I've gained your confidence.' I 
was well aware that I wasn't under as much intense pressure as they were, 
because their entire community depended on what they did. And it's true that I 
didn't have as much to lose as they did, but I also felt that I knew what the 
problem was and I knew how to solve it. So I just kept coming back to the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 8 p.m. Friday, the pacemaker was removed. Within 24 hours, Mother 
Teresa's fever was gone. Within 48 hours, her white blood-cell count was back 
to normal. And, on Tuesday evening, Lombardi was flying into the sunset, back 
toward his quiet life in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Contributed Something' 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel relieved," he said, lowering the back of his airplane seat with a 
long sigh. "But it feels like I contributed something. And it was my time to go 
home. Mother Teresa is in the best of hands. Her heart is the problem now, and 
her team of cardiologists are as good as any anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Did Lombardi fear that a return to routine would be something of a letdown 
after treating such a world figure? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I feel that every day, I have something to contribute," he said. "I don't 
work on an assembly line, although even then there would be something, I'm 
sure. I mean, this isn't like 'Death of a Salesman.' I miss my family terribly, 
and I'm going back to my patients. My patients don't revere me or anything, but 
I do care about them. 
</P>
<P>
"And really, on the whole, it is a good life."

Before he witnessed the final proof, the boy found the circumstantial evidence. 
There was the blowtorch under the bed and the fire-blackened "king-size" spoon 
he had seen around the motel room -- both essentials in preparing illegal drugs 
for injection. 
</P>
<P>
But the clincher, he says, was the day he discovered his mother actually 
sticking a needle into her arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what was going on," the 17-year-old recalls. "But until I caught her 
red-handed shooting it, I thought she was just rocking it," he adds, referring 
to his mother's use of rock or crack cocaine, which is usually smoked but can 
be injected. 
</P>
<P>
In the argument that followed, his mother told him of her drug use, "If you 
don't like it, get the (blank) out." 
</P>
<P>
He did. 
</P>
<P>
"She was my mother," he says, describing the finality of the break three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Another 17-year-old whose life centers around the Los Angeles Youth Network in 
Hollywood also left home three years ago. His story is less dramatic but the 
break seems equally permanent. His mother was a cocaine user, he says, and she 
began selling household appliances, including a television she had given him as 
a present, to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the unpaid bills, the lack of food and the general chaos of home 
became too much. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth when I left I didn't even know I was running away," he 
says. "I thought I was just gone for a couple of days." After a pause, he adds, 
"But after I got up here I found I could make a life for myself." 
</P>
<P>
In the latest furor over drugs in American society, the lives of these two 
juveniles are exercises in irony. Because their mothers could not say no to 
drugs, both high school dropouts -- whose peer group is typically the focus of 
anti-drug campaigns -- are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
They aren't alone. Social service agencies, hospitals and child care facilities 
in Los Angeles and around the country report that children -- ranging from 
infants to adolescents -- are being forced into the homes of grandparents and 
other relatives, foster care, psychiatric wards, even the streets by their 
parents' drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, these drug orphans encompass a broad spectrum of misery, ranging from 
the two 17-year-olds, whose outlook is relatively hopeful, to a 1-year-old girl 
-- apparently blinded and suffering other brain damage from abuse she received 
in the home of a drug-using parent. For the past three months the girl has 
lived in a house operated by the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, a private, 
nonprofit group. She and the five other infants and children in the home 
require 24-hour-care and most have physical and mental problems linked to 
parental drug abuse. The blind girl, for instance, only recently emerged from a 
nearly constant cocoon of sleep or semi-consciousness to make her first 
attempts at crawling and walking, according to the bureau's Pat Darroch. 
</P>
<P>
Care of the blind girl and the others in the home costs $4,200 to $4,500 a 
month with about half subsidized by Los Angeles County, Darroch says. Children 
generally stay at the house six to nine months -- until they are ready to be 
reunited with their parents, who must be drug free and submit to random 
testing, or to a foster home, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
The children's bureau home is an extreme example of the care required by drug 
children. By far the greatest number are placed with foster parents, who may 
care for these children for years, even decades. 
</P>
<P>
But despite such intervention, often at very early ages, those who work with 
drug orphans often fear they are doing too little, too late. Although their 
perspective may be skewed by close association with the children, there is a 
striking unanimity of opinion that the next generation will be a troubled one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sounding a Warning 
</P>
<P>
Darroch's comment is typical. "The school system is going to be flooded with 
these kids in a couple of years," she says, sounding a warning that already has 
become a reality in many school districts, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Avon Dawdy, president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Foster Parents 
Assn. and a foster parent for more than 25 years, has concerns that are more 
far-reaching. "If we don't do something to curb the drug use of these people 
who are having babies, we're going to have an entire generation that can't take 
care of themselves," she declares. 
</P>
<P>
Will Devers, who specializes in "high-risk" drug-child cases at the Los Angeles 
Department of Children's Services, says that an infant turned over to the care 
of his department often has siblings who also must be found and cared for. His 
current case load totals 48 drug babies, he says, all but two with 
cocaine-using parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Horror Stories 
</P>
<P>
Social workers seem to have an inexhaustible fund of horror stories about the 
children of drug-abusing parents. Darroch, Devers and others tell tales of 
parents living in cars with their children because they could not both pay the 
rent and buy drugs, of squalor that repels hardened policemen and refrigerators 
so empty "there wasn't even a cockroach that had died of starvation." 
</P>
<P>
Children born in such circumstances start life with biological as well as 
environmental handicaps. Research by Dr. Ira Chasnoff, a pediatrician at 
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, and others indicates that babies 
born of addicted mothers are more likely to have lower birth weights and 
smaller brains, indications that later on they may have learning disabilities 
as well as behavioral abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
Chasnoff, who is president of a perinatal research group involved in long-term 
study of cocaine-addicted infants, cautions, however, that researchers are only 
beginning to track the children of cocaine users so that the long-term impact, 
while potentially enormous, is unknown. "We've never had a drug like cocaine 
before that has affected such a large number of families," he says, noting that 
heroin, alcohol and other addictive drugs don't seem to have the "chaotic" 
impact of cocaine on the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unknown Scope 
</P>
<P>
Despite these emerging concerns, the overall dimensions of the problem -- 
nationally and regionally -- are unclear, largely because no single agency or 
group tracks all such cases. There are indicators of its scope, though, ranging 
from figures supplied by local agencies to the anecdotal testimony of social 
workers, foster parents and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Most widely publicized are the so-called "crack babies," infants born with 
their mother's addiction to that cheap, highly addictive and easily obtainable 
form of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
And there are new, startling bits of evidence that this earliest form of child 
abuse may cut across economic and racial lines. A study released over the 
weekend by Chasnoff and other researchers found no significant difference in 
the rate of drug use during pregnancy by middle- and upper-income women 
compared with indigent women who most often have been blamed for the surge in 
addicted babies. 
</P>
<P>
"People have always assumed that it (drug abuse during pregnancy) is only a 
problem in urban minority populations," said Chasnoff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing Positive 
</P>
<P>
The study of 715 pregnant women in Pinellas County, Fla., during the first six 
months of this year found that 15.4% of white patients tested positive for 
drugs while 14.1% of black patients tested positive. But it also found that 
minority women who use drugs or alcohol during pregnancy are almost 10 times 
more likely to be reported to child-abuse authorities than white woman who do 
so, because many attend public clinics that are required by law to report 
suspected perinatal substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, it is estimated that as many as 375,000 children are born annually 
with some form of drug addiction. Estimates for cocaine-addicted babies run as 
high as 200,000 per year -- with the rate doubling each year in major cities. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services reports that 
2,284 infants suffering from some form of maternal drug abuse -- usually 
cocaine -- were referred to the department from August, 1988 to July, 1989. 
That's an average of 190 infants per month. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all of our babies that are coming into the (foster care) system are 
drug babies," says foster parent Dawdy. Like others, Dawdy cares for infants 
and children referred by the county's children's services department. Another 
foster parent, Jeanette Lohnes says, "I get at least five calls a day (to care) 
for drug babies. That's all we're getting these days is drug babies." Dawdy, 
Lohnes and others agree that a dramatic rise in drug-afflicted infants began 
three to four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Count 
</P>
<P>
Beyond infancy the counting of drug orphans becomes more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Youth Network's drop-in center in Hollywood, social worker 
Charles Hoeker estimates that roughly half of the 20 to 30 homeless teen-agers 
who stop by daily left home partly because of parental drug and alcohol abuse. 
Dr. Thomas Hicklin, psychiatrist in charge of the 15-bed children's ward at Los 
Angeles County Medical Center, says that perhaps a quarter of his patients have 
problems related to drug abuse by parents. It's not a large number, he says, 
but then the ward is the end-of-the-line for many children from drug-abuse 
homes. "The ones that we see can't make it in foster homes," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a study by the National Committee on the Prevention of Child Abuse 
found that last year in the Washington, D.C. area -- one of the few areas where 
such figures are available -- 90 percent of "caretakers" reported for child 
abuse were active substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requests for Care 
</P>
<P>
In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, requests for foster care increased 
71% from 1985 to 1987, according to a regional government study. Though dated, 
the latter finding supports the widely held opinion among social workers and 
foster parents that they are being deluged with infants and children whose 
lives have been deformed by drug abuse in the womb and in life. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's physical abuse or sexual abuse, it's probably related to drug 
abuse," says Darroch of the children's bureau. ". . . I guess I haven't had the 
experience of having a stone sober person who sexually abused their child." 
</P>
<P>
By current standards, then, older drug orphans such as the two 17-year-olds may 
be lucky. The first, for instance, recounts only one example of attempted abuse 
by his mother and one severe beating by assailants on the street. Although he 
admits to using cocaine heavily himself, he maintains that he has largely 
stayed away from drugs for the past two years. "I despise drugs now," he says 
with apparent conviction. Moreover, social worker Hoeker credits him with a 
quick mind, honesty and a willingness to try to get off the streets, currently 
by trying to join the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, during a conversation it becomes clear that his mother's use of 
drugs has marked him for life in sad and peculiar ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told I was born in Hawaii. I've been told I was born in L.A.," he says. 
" . . . I don't even know where I was born."

EDITOR OF LONDON'S MOST POPULAR PAPER DEFENDS ITS RACY CONTENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newspaper editors do not usually make news, but most of Britain's serious 
papers Tuesday carried a lengthy interview with the editor of the Sun, the 
country's raciest and largest-selling popular tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
For the best part of the eight years Kelvin MacKenzie, 42, has edited the Sun, 
he has declined interviews while his paper has gone from strength to strength 
on a much-scorned mixture of gutter-level gossip, screaming headlines, 
half-naked women, and snappy sports coverage. 
</P>
<P>
So when Mackenzie decided to break his silence and spin his words of 
popular-press philosophy to a group of reporters from the more conventional 
newspapers here, he found an attentive audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baring It All 
</P>
<P>
"Kelvin bares it all in confessions of a Sun editor," said the Guardian, which 
left out of its report MacKenzie's typically cheeky assertion: "We could all go 
and edit the Guardian, whereas the editor of the Guardian couldn't edit the 
Sun." 
</P>
<P>
He may have a point. Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun (circulation 4 million) 
and four other British newspapers, once told a visitor that he thought the Sun, 
under MacKenzie's stewardship, was the best-edited paper in the world. 
</P>
<P>
If the degree to which an editor puts his personal stamp on the paper is the 
measure of successful editing, then MacKenzie surely is in a class of his own. 
</P>
<P>
His selection of stories is nothing if not idiosyncratic, even bizarre. To his 
mind the most important story in the world Tuesday was "Four Pet Bunnies Killed 
by Head." Beneath the front-page, 2-inch-high headline was the story of how a 
school principal shot a neighbor's rabbits because they were eating his 
lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
His readers were told the tale was a "SUN EXCLUSIVE." Certainly, no other paper 
bothered to print it. 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie dismissed the judgment of more conventional editors, saying: "They 
ask what is the most uninteresting thing which has happened in Britain or the 
world yesterday, put that at the top of the page, and then descend slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"To think there are decent trees in Finland being cut down for that. Journalism 
is about doing the unobvious story: the big story from Lebanon is the day when 
there isn't any shooting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Strong Point 
</P>
<P>
Readers of the Sun would be hard-pressed to know whether the guns in Lebanon 
were firing or silent at any time. Foreign news is not its strong point, except 
if it involves movie stars or models. 
</P>
<P>
But at the office of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the Sun is taken 
extremely seriously. Editorially, it hammers home the Thatcherite principles of 
free enterprise and individual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
It has, in the words of one of Mrs. Thatcher's closest aides, "popular 
resonance." The aide said: "If you want to know what the average Briton is 
thinking, don't read the Times, the Telegraph, or the Guardian. Read the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
One feature of the Sun is its daily "Page Three Girl," a black-and-white photo 
of a topless model with a tee-hee caption. Tuesday's Page Three Girl showed a 
bare-chested blonde, under which read the words: "Hairdresser Sharon . . . 
started work as a shampoo girl -- and is still putting the lads in a lather." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Page Three Girl has infuriated feminists, the Sun attracts more 
female readers than any other paper. The pinups, said MacKenzie, were "a 
fixture." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly politicians and others have expressed misgivings about the Sun's 
irresponsibility, its invasion of privacy, and its sheer arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
It provoked legislation, narrowly defeated in parliament, which would have 
imposed limits on media intrusion. It brought censure from other editors and 
journalists for setting a new low in reporting standards and bringing the 
entire profession into disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
As the major sign of public outrage, the Sun was ordered to pay singer Elton 
John a record .56 million in libel damages for unfounded allegations about his 
sex life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invited to Lunch 
</P>
<P>
It was a somewhat chastened editor who invited the reporters to lunch to mark 
the 20th anniversary of Murdoch's acquisition of the Sun, which has its roots 
in the unlikely origins of a serious trade union-backed newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made some big errors. Elton John was a big error. When you're as big 
as the Sun, when you drop a big clangor, that's the danger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie acknowledged that he was also concerned about the prospect of tighter 
legal controls on the media. There is no right-to-know legislation on the books 
here, and English libel laws are much tighter than in the United States. A new 
secrecy act threatens to put even stricter limits on the flow of official 
information to the media. 
</P>
<P>
"A law of privacy is just another form of denying readers their right to know," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the complaints against his paper, MacKenzie earlier this year 
appointed an in-house omsbudsman to pass judgment on contentious stories. So 
far 2 of 63 complaints have been upheld.

THE LIBRARY WHERE THE FOUNDING FATHERS READ 
</P>

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edwin Wolf 2nd, bearded 78-year-old librarian emeritus of the oldest public 
library in America, pulled a small book with a faded yellow cover off a stack 
and opened it. 
</P>
<P>
In the smooth, round handwriting of a teen-ager at the top of the title page of 
"Logic; Or, The Art Of Thinking" a 16-year-old had written his name -- "B. 
Franklin." 
</P>
<P>
In 1731 when Franklin was 25, he launched the first public library in this 
country, The Library Company of Philadelphia, that continues operating to this 
day. The library's first location was in a home on Pewter Platter Alley. 
</P>
<P>
Now 250 years old, The Library Company of Philadelphia has one of the largest 
collections of 17th and 18th-Century books in the U.S. Of the 450,000 books, 
160,000 manuscripts, 50,000 prints and photographs, half were published in the 
1700s and first half of the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Franklin's library served as the library for the Continental 
Congress, for the 55 delegates who wrote the Constitution in Philadelphia in 
1787 and for the nation's first Congress because it provided most of the 
accumulated wisdom published up to that time. The Library Company was then in 
Carpenter's Hall across from Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
When the Revolution began, The Library Company had more than 5,000 volumes, 
books still on the shelves today in its latest quarters, an eight-story modern 
building at 1314 Locust Street in the heart of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Several hundred books and pamphlets on our shelves belonged to Franklin," 
noted Wolf, The Library Company's librarian from 1952 to 1984, who brought the 
historic institution out of bankruptcy into a vigorous new era. 
</P>
<P>
The Library Company was the largest public library in America from Franklin's 
time through the mid-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
When Franklin was 21 in 1727 he organized Junto, a discussion group also known 
as the Leather Apron Club whose members met to debate politics and philosophy 
and to exchange knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later when Franklin wrote in his autobiography, he began with these 
words "my first project of a public nature, a subscription library." Fifty 
members of Junto pooled their resources to launch the library and ordered a 
well-rounded collection of books from London. There were no bookstores in 
Philadelphia then. 
</P>
<P>
Their first shipment from England was 141 volumes including Palladio's 
"Architecture," Bailey's "Dictionarium," Boerhaave's "Chemistry," Gordon's 
"Geography," Drake's "Anatomy," Ellis' "Practical Farmer," Defoe's "Complete 
English Tradesman," Plutarch's "Lives," Pope's "Homer," Dryden's "Virgil," 
Milton's "Paradise Lost" and Rapin-Thoyras' "History of England." 
</P>
<P>
A letter about the library appeared in a copy of Franklin's Pennsylvania 
Gazette published in the spring of 1740. The writer commented: 
</P>
<P>
"I am but a poor ordinary Mechanick of this city, obligated to work hard for 
the maintenance of myself, my wife and several small children. When my daily 
labour is over, instead of going to the Alehouse, I amuse myself with the books 
of The Library Company." 
</P>
<P>
Forty years after Franklin founded the nation's first public library, he wrote: 
"This was the mother of all American subscription libraries now so numerous. 
</P>
<P>
"These libraries have improv'd the general conversation of the Americans, made 
the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other 
countries, and perhaps contribute in some degree to the stand so generally made 
throughout the colonies in defence of their privileges." 
</P>
<P>
Although The Library Company was established by members paying a fee and annual 
dues, it was open to the public "to make available substantial and 
comprehensive book resources for all the citizenry of Philadelphia." Today the 
library consists of 969 shareholder members, but it is still open to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The Library Company of Philadelphia fell upon hard times during the Great 
Depression and it went bankrupt in 1941. The Philadelphia Public Library 
administered The Library Company's rich historic collections from 1941 to 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Rare book dealer Edwin Wolf 2nd was asked to take an inventory of the library's 
vast collection and was appointed its librarian in 1952. He turned its negative 
financial situation around and set the library in a new direction. In 1955 The 
Library Company ended its relationship with the city's public library and was 
on its own again. 
</P>
<P>
From 1879 to 1966 The Library Company was located in a huge Parthenon-like 
structure with massive Doric columns on a four-acre site in South Philadelphia. 
Insiders called it "The Great Pile." In his will, wealthy eccentric James Rush, 
a physician who died in 1869, left $1 million to erect the building. 
</P>
<P>
There were many codicils attached to his bequest. He and his wife, Phoebe Anne 
Rush, were to be buried in the library, the chairs in the library were to be 
austere without upholstery, no poetry, biographies of unknown persons or daily 
newspapers were to be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
The Library Company sold the building and the four acres to the city in 1966. 
The old library has stood vacant ever since, a landmark eyesore. When the move 
was made, the remains of Dr. Rush and his wife were reburied in the courtyard 
of the new library under their original tombstones. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always this rumor that Phoebe Rush was buried wearing a fantastic 
collection of jewelry," recalled Wolf. "We opened her coffin when the move was 
made. No jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its endowments, fund drives and memberships, an important source 
of income for The Library Company has been a profitable, four-story downtown 
garage that it owns. It does not receive any public funding. 
</P>
<P>
The Library Company of Philadelphia today is a research library, not a lending 
library as it was in the past. In addition to its books it is filled with many 
historic treasures, works of art, 18th Century furniture, and memorabilia from 
prominent colonial families. Benjamin Franklin's hand-cranked static 
electricity machine, for example, is here. 
</P>
<P>
But for scholars, authors, historians and graduate students, the real treasures 
are the 18th- and 19th-Century books. Those who use the library come from all 
over the nation and from many different parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Larson, 30, who comes from Santa Barbara, is here doing research for a 
Harvard Ph.D. dissertation about 18th-Century Quaker women who were traveling 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
She has been spending a month poring through journals kept by Quaker women 
ministers during the 1700s. "These were women, many with husbands and children, 
who felt they had a divine call to leave their families for months, sometimes 
years, and travel throughout the colonies preaching the word of God," explained 
Larson. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the women traveled by ship to the British Isles to preach as they 
wandered the countryside there. Others came from the British Isles to America 
to preach here. I'm the first person since the early mid- and late-1700s to run 
my fingers through these pages and read many of these journals. It's an amazing 
story. For me, The Library Company of Philadelphia is a gold mine." 
</P>
<P>
It is a gold mine for anyone doing research on any subject pertaining to the 
18th and 19th centuries.

'RAIN MAN' BLINDED BY 'SUNRISE'

The surprise of the week is that "Rain Man" -- the mighty Oscar winner and the 
box-office champ of 1988 -- isn't yet No. 1 on the Billboard magazine rental 
chart. In its second week on the chart, "Rain Man" rose two notches to No. 4, a 
bit disappointing for a film everyone expected to instantly zoom to the top of 
the chart. If "Rain Man" doesn't make it to the top in the next two weeks, 
maybe its rental appeal was overestimated. "Tequila Sunrise" (No. 1) is a much 
bigger rental hit than expected. Boasting three big stars -- Mel Gibson, 
Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell -- it figured to crack the Top Five, but not 
to top the chart for three straight weeks. The way "Beaches" (No. 2) is rising 
, it may hit No. 1 before "Rain Man." The sleeper rental hit is "Bill and Ted's 
Excellent Adventure," a teen fantasy that boasts no stars and was pummeled by 
critics. It jumped from No. 17 to No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
* The raunchy comedy "Skin Deep," starring John Ritter as its lecherous hero, 
did modestly at the box office, but it's the kind of comedy that young renters 
relish. "Skin Deep" entered the chart at No. 18, but look for it to wind up in 
the Top 10.

TRANSIT FUNDING INCREASES L.A. ARTS ENDOWMENT BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The windfall of arts funds for local artists, which began with the passage last 
November of the more than $20 million Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts, is 
getting a $2.7-million addition -- plus several million more in years to come 
-- from another local government agency, the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission. The agency is allocating one-half of 1% of all construction costs 
for its rail transit commuter lines for public art works in each of its 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
According to the LACTC's Public Art Administrator Jessica Cusick, who is 
responsible for the commission's Art for Rail Transit program, the commission 
plans to "promote a wide variety of visual art" through the program, including 
sculpture, wall murals and artistic design features such as benches, fences and 
lighting. At least one piece of public art will be installed in each station, 
and artists will be involved in the design process of some of the stations as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The move, which Cusick said will improve the neighborhoods and communities 
through which the aboveground light rail transit lines pass, is the latest in 
what public arts administrators are calling a new outlook on the importance of 
public art. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it entirely as a quality of life issue," said Barbara Goldstein, project 
coordinator for the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs department, during a Tuesday 
night meeting with local artists at Barnsdall Art Park. "People are beginning 
to see the way the arts can be used as a way to enhance the quality of life in 
Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Grabinski, LACTC Commissioner and Long Beach City Councilman, said artists 
are not the only ones who will benefit from the windfall of funds being spent 
on public arts. 
</P>
<P>
He said that art in public transportation systems "makes waiting in a station 
more of an event, and takes away some of the apprehension and a little of the 
waiting time." 
</P>
<P>
"What we hope to do is expand the public's awareness of contemporary art," 
Cusick said of the Art for Rail Transit program, which will begin with the 
first commuter line -- the 22-mile Long Beach-to-downtown Los Angeles Blue Line 
which is scheduled to open next July. 
</P>
<P>
But the program will not end there, as LACTC will be commissioning artists "for 
years to come," Cusick said. She said that in addition to the $2.7-million art 
budget for the Blue Line, the commission expects an arts fund of $1.5 million 
to $2 million for its 20-mile Norwalk-to-El Segundo Green Line (scheduled to 
open in 1994), and similar amounts for future lines (four are currently under 
consideration). 
</P>
<P>
(In a separate program for the rail transit's downtown underground Metrorail 
portion known as the Red Line, which is administered by the Rapid Transit 
District, $575,000 has been allocated for artists' fees and the construction of 
art in those stations.)

CIRQUE DU SOLEIL RISES OVER L.A. AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MISHA BERSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Cirque du Soleil pitched its sky-blue-and-goldenrod-yellow big 
top on California soil, it was in Little Tokyo. The year was 1987; the targeted 
occasion, opening night of the Los Angeles Festival. According to Cirque 
founder-director Guy Laliberte, the entire future of the Montreal-based troupe 
was riding on that single show. 
</P>
<P>
"If the critics didn't like us, we wouldn't have had the money to put gas in 
the trucks and get home," said Laliberte recently in San Francisco, where 
Cirque was playing to 98% capacity houses. "We were gambling our whole circus 
on a one-night deal." 
</P>
<P>
That gamble paid off handsomely. Reviewers loved Cirque du Soleil's youthful 
one-ring extravaganza, a glossy animal-free melange of high-wire and 
teeterboard stunts, rambunctious clowning and thrilling acrobatics, all wrapped 
up in fanciful costumes and choreographed to a synthesized rock beat. Audiences 
loved it too, packing the 1,756-seat tent nightly. The circus wound up with 
plenty of gas money for the ride home to Canada. And they had no trouble 
returning in 1988, this time to perform at the Santa Monica Municipal Pier on 
the first leg of a triumphant six-city U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
Cirque du Soleil is back at the same spot offering another lively demonstration 
of the uses of enchantment through Oct. 15. Or, as its distinctive print ads 
would have it, "la magie continue.. . ." 
</P>
<P>
But stage magic alone can't account for the wildfire success of this young 
circus troupe. In just five years of operation, Soleil has blossomed from a 
small upstart circus into a major North American touring attraction. It now has 
150 employees, a budget in excess of $10 million, an annual audience of more 
than 500,000, and a mystique that just won't quit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're successful because we're different," said Laliberte. "We came from the 
street as a bunch of 23-, 24-year-old kids. I think we're changing the whole 
image of circus. Coming to Cirque du Soleil is like going to make a picnic." 
</P>
<P>
Cirque du Soleil's popularity, and its special brand of polished whimsy, have a 
lot to do with Laliberte's exuberant stewardship. A former stilt-walker and 
fire-eater, the blond, puckish 30-year-old combines a street artist's 
freewheeling spirit with a sharp instinct for business. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in English flavored by a French-Canadian accent, Laliberte described 
himself as "a great conceptor. Cirque du Soleil to me is a show inside a 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
That concept was born in 1984 as an outgrowth of a street artist's festival 
Laliberte produced in the tiny town of Baie St. Paul, Quebec. On the strength 
of the festival, the Canadian government agreed to subsidize Cirque du Soleil's 
first season. Initially, the group toured only in Canada, but the United States 
was much on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We already knew we were condemned if we didn't have something for export," 
said Laliberte. "A circus can't perform in Canada more than three, four months 
a year because of the bad weather. We had to have a big U.S. market to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the group moved a step closer to that goal when Laliberte came home 
from a trip to Italy with a spacious new big top. "Everybody thought I was 
crazy because we had no money," he said. "I was buying $400,000 worth of 
equipment with only $10,000 in my pocket. Then I had to go out and (find) $2 
million to make the season happen." 
</P>
<P>
While Laliberte was out wooing and winning support from Canadian airlines and 
other corporate sponsors, the group's artistic staff perfected a performing 
style. A marvel of slickness and spontaneity, Cirque du Soleil blends some of 
the flash of commercial circuses with some of the intimacy of one-ring outfits 
like Circus Oz and the Pickle Family Circus. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no tradition of circus in Canada, so we were free to do something new," 
noted Gilles Ste. Croix, an early Cirque performer and its present artistic 
director. "We are really theater people so we used a lot of references to 
theater and dance. And we've always been very careful about our visual 
aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to say that through the powers of imagination anyone can be 
creative," said Ste. Croix. "Our motto has always been, 'Free the imagination.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The troupe's current edition boasts all new acts and a more lighthearted, comic 
flavor than the 1988 edition. Ste. Croix also points out that last year's entry 
"was what we call fleur bleue -- soft edges, romance, and characters acting 
like poupees, little dolls. Now we have characters more like humans, and the 
design is more hard-edged and geometric." 
</P>
<P>
The cast of 35, drawn in part from the company-run National Circus School, 
contains familiar and unfamiliar faces. Benny LeGrand, a splay-haired, 
mischief-making clown, is back for his fifth consecutive year. The sexy 
acrobatic team of Eric Varelas and Amelie Denay has returned for its second 
season. Among the newcomers, the Shandong Troupe of China stands out. This 
remarkable group of teen-age balancers defies gravity on the "rola bola" board. 
Another more orthodox edition is the graceful gymnastic dance routine by Maia 
Taskova and Mariela Spasova, a pair of champion athletes from Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
As Cirque du Soleil embarks on its sixth season, Guy Laliberte talks 
enthusiastically about "diversifying." Tours to Japan and Europe are on the 
horizon. An entirely new show with a new theme is in the works. When it's 
ready, Soleil will have two troupes on the road, Ringling Bros.-style. The 
organization is also managing a growing number of offshoot enterprises: a 
circus school, a film and video outfit, several ticket outlets, and a 
merchandising unit. 
</P>
<P>
Though he refers fondly to Soleil's street-artist past, Laliberte acknowledges 
that he is running an entertainment corporation now: "For the first five years 
it was a family trip. Now it's become a business. But a goal and a big step is 
keeping the family spirit in the business. In the next five years we'll see 
just how much we can do with our success, financially and in the integrity of 
our performing. We want to go as far as we can and still keep the soul of 
Cirque du Soleil alive."

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT VOWS TO SCRUTINIZE AIRLINE MERGERS

A Justice Department official said Wednesday that the department will promote 
competition in the airline industry through strict enforcement of antitrust 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be assured that the antitrust laws will be vigorously enforced with 
respect to the airline industry -- and all other industries -- during my tenure 
as head of the antitrust division," Assistant Atty. Gen. James Rill said in 
testimony to the Senate aviation subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Rill said the department will closely examine any proposed mergers, joint 
ventures, sales of airport flight slots or other assets, pricing practices and 
other potentially anti-competitive actions. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee members said they were concerned over the growing concentration of 
airlines through mergers and flight restrictions at major airports. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 10 years, the price I pay for my ticket to Kentucky has gone up 
400%," said Kentucky Democratic Sen. Wendell Ford. "If I do not fly with one 
airline, I'm out of luck." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking very strongly at (re)-regulation," said Alaskan Republican Sen. 
Ted Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
"The Justice Department intends to use its new authority to enforce those 
(antitrust) laws vigorously and to promote and protect free market competition 
in the airline industry," Rill said, referring to the authority over airline 
mergers it acquired from the Transportation Department on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department was closely monitoring Eastern Airlines' bankruptcy 
proceedings to determine if they were likely to harm competition and would ask 
the bankruptcy court to withhold action on any proposed asset sale if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice and Transportation departments recently opposed the sale of 
Eastern's Philadelphia gates and routes to USAir, and they were sold to smaller 
Midway Airlines instead. 
</P>
<P>
Rill said the department would also watch joint ventures by foreign and 
domestic airlines, including interline flights. 
</P>
<P>
"These types of transactions, or any consolidation between foreign and domestic 
airlines, would be analyzed under the antitrust laws using the same analysis 
described in the department's 1984 merger guidelines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weary of Studies 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners can have no more than a 25% interest in a U.S. airline. Scandinavian 
Airlines System recently acquired a 9.9% interest in Continental Airlines, 
Holland's KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was a major investor in the group that 
bought Northwest Airlines and British Airways is purchasing 15% of United 
Airlines in an employee-management buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Shane said the department was 
preparing a study of competition in the airline industry and would make policy 
recommendations in a few months, but Sen. Ford called for quicker action. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting tired of waiting for studies. We're studying this thing to 
death," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said flight restrictions and a shortage of gates at major airports were 
the major factors limiting competition. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said Tuesday that he would not allow 
debt from leveraged buyouts to jeopardize airline safety.

Adobe Systems Inc. struck back Wednesday in an emerging desktop publishing 
battle over how type is displayed on personal computer screens and printers. 
</P>
<P>
One day after Apple Computer Inc. and Microsoft Corp. announced an unusual 
alliance to set the standard for computer fonts, which define the shape and 
size of letters, Adobe said it would open up its own proprietary font 
technology so anybody could use it. 
</P>
<P>
That step, while helping Adobe's competitors, should confirm the Adobe system 
as an industry standard and deal a blow to the joint effort by Apple and 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
The seemingly obscure battle will affect the course of desktop publishing, 
which makes it possible for personal computer owners to create 
professional-looking documents and publications using special software and 
laser printers.

John E. Warnock, Adobe's chairman, chief executive and co-founder, announced 
the decision to publish PostScript specifications in an emotional speech at a 
conference in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
He said he feared Apple's unspecific plans for new software amounted to 
"vaporware" that could jeopardize a valuable existing standard. 
</P>
<P>
An agreed-upon standard makes things easier for makers of computers, printers 
and new typefaces as well as computer users. With Adobe's announcement, 
companies that already use its PostScript computer language may decide to stick 
with it instead of spending their efforts on the Apple-Microsoft plans, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think this is a very good move," said David Nelson, an analyst 
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. He said customers attending the conference 
"overwhelmingly" indicated in a show of hands that they would stick with Adobe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Hurt 
</P>
<P>
Adobe's stock was hurt Wednesday by the Apple-Microsoft combination, which came 
after the close of trading Tuesday, but helped by Adobe's counterploy. It 
closed the day off 37.5 cents at $19.75 in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Adobe, which is based in Palo Alto, rose rapidly in recent years to dominate 
the software that goes into laser printers and controls their output. 
</P>
<P>
Apple, which had been Adobe's biggest customer, signalled its intention to go 
its own way earlier this year when it sold its 16% stake in Adobe. 
</P>
<P>
Apple and Microsoft, which are battling each other in an unrelated copyright 
suit, set aside their differences Tuesday to announce they would swap 
technology on advanced printer fonts.

Neiman Marcus Group Inc.: The Chestnut Hill, Mass., retailing concern reported 
fiscal 1989 profit of $25.3 million. In 1988, the company posted a profit of 
$4.8 million using a now-discontinued accounting method; its 1988 profit would 
have been $15.5 million using its new method. Revenue increased 20% in 1989 to 
$1.5 billion. The firm said earnings for the year were reduced by the inclusion 
of results from Horchow Mail Order Inc., which had a "disappointing" 
performance following its acquisition. Each of the company's other divisions, 
including Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals, had "significantly improved 
results."

Casino Deal Scrapped: An investor group said it has canceled plans to buy the 
ailing Claridge Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J. Alfred J. Luciani, 
president of A.L.M. Moonstone Inc., said his group could not agree with 
Claridge officials "over money and time." The deal was originally was scheduled 
to close Aug. 15, but Claridge officials said continued negotiations made it 
unclear whether it could close this year. The Claridge lost about $20 million 
in 1988 on revenue of $174.6 million. In June, Claridge Corp. took control of 
the casino hotel from Del Webb Corp. of Phoenix after completing a financial 
restructuring plan.

LOWER EARNINGS FORECASTS SEEN AS SIGN OF SLOWDOWN

<P>
At least nine U.S. companies have lowered their earnings forecasts this week, 
making Wall Street jittery and heightening concern over a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known company to deflate analysts' optimism was Avon Products Inc., 
the New York cosmetics giant that said both 1989 and 1990 earnings would be 
below expectations. It blamed soft U.S. sales and a stronger-than-anticipated 
dollar, which reduced its revenue from foreign units. 
</P>
<P>
Avon's announcement followed Stratus Computer Inc.'s surprise lower 
third-quarter forecast Monday, which caused its stock to fall $7.50 a share to 
$26.50. 
</P>
<P>
Stratus, a maker of fault-tolerant computer systems, cited a weak domestic 
market as a reason for the profit shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sounding Warnings 
</P>
<P>
The earnings downgradings are "a sign of not having the growth now that we had 
six months ago, or a year ago," said John McElroy, principal of 1838 Investment 
Advisors L.P. 
</P>
<P>
The government's revised second-quarter gross national product figure, to be 
announced today, is expected to show a 2.7% rise for the second quarter, 
unchanged from its previous figure. 
</P>
<P>
But two reports released this week indicate that the third-quarter pace may be 
slower. August consumer prices were unchanged for the first time in three 
years, and housing starts dropped a surprising 5%. 
</P>
<P>
A number of smaller companies scattered across various industries have sounded 
warnings about earnings. Apart from Stratus, computer concern Landmark Graphics 
Corp., noting uncertain demand for its computer systems for industrial uses, 
revised downward its first-quarter earnings expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Two financial services firms, Peoples Westchester Savings Bank and Amcore 
Financial Inc., cited slower loan demand as reasons for their lowered outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Gas systems operator Valero Energy Corp.; Utilicorp United, an electric 
utility; Square D Co., an equipment company, and Arco Chemical Co. rounded out 
the list.

CAMPEAU, RESCUERS ARE CONTRAST IN STYLE

When it comes to odd couples, Paul Reichmann, the low-key and deliberate 
financial wizard whose family controls Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., is 
about as far away as you can get from the flamboyant and adventurous Robert 
Campeau. 
</P>
<P>
"One is pure logic and one is pure emotion," said a Toronto stock analyst who 
follows Campeau Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the Reichmanns, who Tuesday gained the power to lead the troubled 
company through a massive overhaul, should have a powerful effect in 
straightening it out. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Reichmann, 58, along with brothers Albert, 60, and Ralph, 56, have turned 
a series of shrewd, well-timed investments and innovative financing into an 
empire, including more than $5 billion worth of property in Manhattan, where 
they are the biggest commercial landlords. Fortune magazine estimates their net 
worth at $8.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Reichmann, a Talmudic scholar who is the guiding force and chief 
strategist of the family operation, is noted for his ability to be fiscally 
cautious and exhaustively analytical and yet take apparently huge risks. "He is 
the ultimate rational economic man," said a Manhattan real estate industry 
executive who has dealt with the Reichmanns. 
</P>
<P>
Albert, who sits on the Campeau board and whose specialties include building 
design, is the other chief force in the real estate and investment operations, 
while Ralph sticks to the building tile business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Business Ties 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Albert Reichmann signed a preliminary agreement to develop 
a 70-acre site in Moscow, including the largest building in the Soviet Union, 
plus hotel and office space. The Reichmanns are also looking at joining a 
consortium to develop a huge office project on islands in Tokyo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Reichmanns and Campeau have had business ties for more than a decade. "It's 
a relationship that many people have a difficult time understanding, but it's a 
solid and longstanding relationship," said Carol Sanger, a Campeau spokeswoman. 
"They are there for each other when it matters." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Reichmanns will not get involved in day-to-day operation of 
Campeau's retail empire but will play a strong role in setting a new direction 
and tightening fiscal controls. 
</P>
<P>
The Reichmanns, including Paul, who started out in social work, have a history 
of stepping in when a buddy is in trouble -- but on very businesslike terms. 
They are also used to stepping into troubled situations where -- after intense 
analysis -- they see bargains and opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"They do meticulous research and they know where they want to go before they 
start out on the journey," said Meyer S. Frucher, executive vice president of 
Olympia &amp; York in Manhattan. "They're not afraid of making a deal that 
others will not make." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Tall Buildings 
</P>
<P>
Among their early successes, in 1977, the Reichmanns bought eight buildings in 
Manhattan formerly owned by the Uris family -- paying $320 million for what is 
now worth more than $3 billion. They have interests in 100 million square feet 
of office space in North America and England, including 25 million in New York. 
</P>
<P>
They are developing Canary Wharf, a $6-billion-plus project that will replace 
deserted wharves and warehouses in London's East End with 24 buildings, 
including the tallest in Britain. When other developers wanted to develop the 
World Financial Center at Manhattan's Battery Park building by building, the 
Reichmanns were willing to proceed with all four buildings, totaling 8 million 
square feet, at once. 
</P>
<P>
In Toronto, they built the 5-million-square-foot First Canadian Place, 
including Canada's tallest building. They are fond of tall buildings, but a 
tentative $1-billion deal to buy the Sears Tower in Chicago, the world's 
tallest building, has stalled. 
</P>
<P>
The Reichmanns have gobbled up stakes in energy and timber resources, holding a 
73% stake in Gulf Canada Resources, 82% in newsprint producer Abitibi-Price, 
89% of GW Utilities and 19.4% in Santa Fe Southern Pacific, among their 
$5-billion stock portfolio.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: LITTLE MAC TESTS OUT AS BIG ON VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

analyst and writer.

<P>
The wait is over. Apple Computer on Wednesday finally unveiled its 
long-anticipated Macintosh Portable, becoming the last of the major personal 
computer makers to release a battery-powered machine. 
</P>
<P>
Was it worth waiting for? I think so. The Macintosh Portable is a first-rate 
machine that uses state-of-the-art technology. It has an exceptionally good 
screen and a long battery life. 
</P>
<P>
Although the machine is a pleasure to use, it's not light and it's not cheap. 
The basic unit, with a megabyte of memory and a single floppy disk drive, 
weighs nearly 14 pounds and costs $5,800. The model with a 40-megabyte hard 
disk costs $6,500 and weighs just under 16 pounds. With all the key options, 
the computer can cost more than $7,300. 
</P>
<P>
I spent several hours with the portable and came away feeling as if I had been 
using a regular desktop Macintosh. In fact, I actually preferred its screen to 
the one in the regular Macintosh SE. 
</P>
<P>
Apple is the first computer company to use an "Active Matrix Liquid Crystal 
Display." Unlike other liquid crystal displays, the active matrix screen has a 
separate transistor to control each of the 256,000 dots or pixels that appear. 
</P>
<P>
The transistors make it possible for the screen to display quickly moving 
objects without the annoying blur or lag you get on the laptop computers that 
Apple's machine will compete against. (Given the Macintosh Portable's weight, 
it's arguable that it doesn't actually belong in the laptop category, but I 
think it's small enough to be considered one.) That's important for Mac users 
because the cursor, or pointer, is often moved quickly from one portion of the 
screen to another. I've used mice on other laptops but have always found the 
blur to be extremely annoying. 
</P>
<P>
The 8 3/8-inch by 5 1/4-inch screen is exceptionally easy on the eyes. It 
displays dark black letters against a pale green background. The screen can be 
viewed from almost any angle; it's not necessary to sit directly in front of it 
as you do with other laptops. 
</P>
<P>
Another breakthrough is the battery. Apple went back to the future by using a 
lead acid battery, rather than the nickel cadmium batteries normally used in 
laptops. The battery is similar to those used in cars, but it is fully sealed 
and leak-proof. 
</P>
<P>
While most hard-disk equipped laptops run out of battery power after two or 
three hours, the Macintosh Portable can operate on its battery for up to 10 
hours, according to Apple. If that's not enough, you can install a spare 
battery without losing any work in progress. A nine-volt battery maintains 
power while the main battery is removed. 
</P>
<P>
To save energy, the screen dims and the hard disk stops spinning if no one uses 
the machine for a specified period of time. The machine doesn't even have an 
on/off switch. When you're done working, you select the "sleep" command to shut 
down the screen and disk or just walk away and let the machine "go to sleep" on 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
The sleep mode uses very little power, although the memory remains active. 
Press any key and the machine "wakes up" exactly as you left it. If the machine 
goes to sleep while you're running a program, that program is still in memory 
when you wake it up. Because of this feature, the machine is always ready for 
immediate use. When I turn on my desktop Mac, it takes about 35 seconds before 
the machine is ready for use, plus several more seconds to load in my software 
and data. 
</P>
<P>
All desktop Macintoshes come with a mouse that is used as a pointing device to 
select commands, highlight data and to manipulate graphics. Users drag the 
mouse across their desk, causing a ball on the bottom to revolve and send 
signals to the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Laptop users, however, don't always have desks at their disposal. So for the 
portable, Apple built a "trackball" directly onto the keyboard. The trackball 
is like an upside-down mouse. Instead of having a ball on the bottom, there is 
one on top that users manipulate with the palm of their hands. I found the 
trackball hard to get used to. Fortunately, it also comes with a mouse and it 
can be equipped with an optional external keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
The machine uses a power-saving version of the same Motorola 68000 central 
processing unit, or CPU, as the Macintosh SE, but it operates at twice the 
speed (16 megahertz) as the SE. It's not as fast as the Macintosh II series of 
machines, but it is fast enough for most business applications, including word 
processing, communications, spreadsheets and basic graphics. 
</P>
<P>
I tested the machine by connecting it to my own 80-megabyte external hard disk. 
That way, I was able to use all my own programs. Every one worked except one 
that requires a Macintosh II. The machine I tested had two megabytes of memory, 
enough to allow me to run two programs at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The portable has one expansion slot, making it possible to add a color display 
adapter, an internal fax modem or another device. To do that, however, you will 
need an expansion card designed specifically for the portable. The portable 
machine, however, does have the same ports, or sockets, as other Macs so you 
can plug in an external floppy disk drive, an extra hard disk, a modem, a 
printer and other devices such as a scanner or compact disc drive. Like all 
Macs, the portable also has a socket to connect it to an AppleTalk local area 
network. Most IBM-compatible laptops can not easily be connected to networks. 
</P>
<P>
The Mac Portable isn't for everyone. Although I'd consider using such a machine 
in a hotel room, I wouldn't want to carry it around with me all day. I 
generally carry a six-pound IBM-compatible laptop or a four-pound Radio Shack 
notebook computer. Neither is as nice as the new Mac, but they are a lot 
lighter, much cheaper and able to exchange data with a Mac or regular PC. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, for some users, such as field auditors, engineers and people who 
need to make presentations to clients, the machine can be a boon to 
productivity and well worth the cost and weight. 
</P>
<P>
It could also be an excellent executive computer, even for those who have no 
intention of taking it on a business trip. It's quieter than other Macs and PCs 
(silent when the hard disk is asleep), it doesn't take up a lot of desk space 
and there are no ugly cables to clutter your office. What's more, it's 
relatively easy to take home at night, possibly eliminating the need for a home 
computer. Also, there is something nice about a computer that you can take to 
the library or use out of doors. 
</P>
<P>
MACINTOSH PORTABLE 
</P>
<P>
Apple's first laptop computer features a very easy to read screen and runs up 
to 10 hours on a single battery charge. The machine's keyboard has a built-in 
trackball pointing device. 
</P>
<P>
Features: The basic unit comes with one megabyte of memory (expandable to 2 
megabytes) and a 1.4-megabyte floppy disk drive that can read from and write to 
disks from other Macs as well as 3 1/2-inch disks from IBM compatibles and 
Apple IIs. An optional 40-megabyte internal hard disk is also available. 
</P>
<P>
Exandability: There is one expansion slot (not compatible with those on other 
Macs) and connectors for two serial ports, external floppy disk drive, stereo 
sound jack, extra mouse and keyboard and small computer system interface 
expansion device, such as an external hard disk or scanner, along with a 
connector for an optional external video monitor or projection device. 
</P>
<P>
Size: 15.25 inches wide and 14.83 inches long. It weighs 13.75 pounds without a 
hard disk and 15.75 pounds with a hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
Price: $5,800 for a floppy drive only or $6,500 for a floppy drive and a 
40-megabyte hard disk.

PROBE OF LINCOLN S&amp;L'S OUTSIDE AUDITORS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state agency will investigate three major accounting firms that worked on 
financial statements for the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine to 
determine if they were negligent, a state Board of Accountancy official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board will initiate its investigation of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., Arthur 
Young &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp; Co. within the "next few weeks," said 
Gregory J. Newington, the agency's enforcement program director. The Arthur 
Young firm merged with Ernst &amp; Whinney earlier this year and now is known 
as Ernst &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators, who filed a $1.1-billion racketeering suit last week 
against Lincoln's former operators, also are investigating the role of those 
accounting firms in Lincoln's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The racketeering suit levels a harsh blast at Arthur Young and Jack D. 
Atchison, one of its partners in Phoenix who quit last year to work for 
Lincoln's parent company, Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. Though it 
does not name either as a defendant, the suit nevertheless claims they 
misrepresented Lincoln's condition in a 1987 letter to a public official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stand Behind Audits 
</P>
<P>
The letter, together with the intervention of U.S. senators called in by 
American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating, a heavy contributor to 
political campaigns, "protracted the examination process and afforded 
(operators) additional time in which to exacerbate their frauds" on Lincoln and 
regulators, according to the racketeering suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand behind the audits," said Eugene Erbstoesser, Arthur Young's associate 
general counsel in Los Angeles. He denied that the accounting firm did anything 
wrong either in responding to public officials or in auditing Lincoln's and 
American Continental's books. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the accountancy board for revealing its investigation 
through the media. He said his firm had not been notified yet about the board's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and spokesmen for the other two accounting firms could not be reached 
for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental 
filed for bankruptcy. Industry experts claim the S&amp;L, which has since been 
declared insolvent, will cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion, which would make it 
the most expensive thrift bailout ever. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the accounting firms, particularly Arthur Young, were roundly 
criticized in a review by the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. of 
15 major real estate transactions at Lincoln. Regulators hired Leventhal to 
conduct the review. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, lawsuits filed by investors against corporate insiders and their 
advisers, including the accounting firms, claim that favorable audits helped to 
stall regulators for more than a year in their effort to seize Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on 2 Firms 
</P>
<P>
In that time American Continental sold nearly $200 million of high-risk 
subordinated debentures, essentially corporate IOUs, through Lincoln's 29 
Southern California branches to some 22,000 investors. Now, the investors 
expect their holdings to be wiped out in the bankruptcy proceedings in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Newington said the accountancy board's investigation will center on Arthur 
Andersen, which audited the thrift's books through 1985, and Arthur Young, 
which audited the books for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The board also will look at Touche Ross, which was hired to help American 
Continental prepare the report on its third-quarter results last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 1988 third-quarter report that provided the first dramatic, public 
evidence of trouble at the thrift and American Continental. The company wanted 
to record a $56-million profit as part of what it claimed was an $81-million 
profit from the increased value of stock a Lincoln subsidiary held after a swap 
of stock interests with British financier Sir James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Young disagreed and quit over the issue. Its replacement, Touche Ross, 
suggested getting approval from various regulators before booking the profit. 
</P>
<P>
But the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the attempt to book the 
profit. Lincoln then posted a $20-million quarterly loss, and the company 
reported a consolidated quarterly loss of $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Newington said Touche Ross' involvement in Lincoln may be "on the periphery" 
but will still be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation into Lincoln's outside accountants likely will take "many, 
many months, perhaps a year or so," he said.

DOW DECLINES 3.42 IN ANOTHER QUIET SESSION

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices hovered in a narrow range Wednesday, continuing their recent 
sluggish trend in a slow session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 3.42 to 2,683.89. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues and declines ran about even in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 697 up, 726 down and 547 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 136.64 million shares, down from 141.61 million in the 
previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, 
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
over-the-counter market, totaled 164.94 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stocks had apparently pulled back enough since they hit a record 
high before Labor Day to attract a little catch-up buying by investors who had 
been waiting for an opportunity to increase their stock holdings. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers also noted uneasiness about the market's uninspired showing 
Tuesday, when the Dow Jones industrials gave up a gain of about 10 points to 
finish down 0.19. 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn dropped 1/4 to 36 1/8 in active trading. The Food and Drug 
Administration said an advisory committee was investigating the safety of 
Upjohn's prescription sleeping agent Halcion. 
</P>
<P>
AMR, whose American Airlines subsidiary posted fare increases to take effect 
next week, rose 2 1/8 to 78 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
One notable area of strength in the market was closed-end investment companies 
specializing in securities of individual countries or regions of the world 
outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
These issues have been in demand of late, with several offerings of new 
"country" funds scheduled to come to market in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's trading, Thai Fund jumped 2 1/2 to 21 1/4; Italy Fund 3/4 to 10 
7/8; Germany Fund 1/2 to 11, and Spain Fund 3/4 to 22 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, share prices on Tokyo Stock Exchange declined slightly. The 225-issue 
Nikkei stock average fell 0.49 points, or 0.001%, to finish at 34,470.58. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at 
2,369.6, up 8.3 points, or 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
The credit market suffered a broad setback, with yields jumping for both 
short-term Treasury bills and long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers were at a loss for explanations for the losses, although some put part 
of the blame on a decline in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 13/16 point, or more than $8 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield, which rises when prices fall, increased to 
8.16% from 8.09% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in bonds came in light trading, although not as light as earlier in 
the week. The bond market was "relatively terrible," said Gib Clark, chief 
trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell 1/4 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/2 point and long-term issues 
were down almost 1 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve injected reserves into the banking system, but the step was 
regarded as a technical move to relieve upward pressure on the federal funds 
rate at the end of a two-week reserve measurement period. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fresh reserves, the federal funds rate, which is the interest 
on overnight loans between banks, ended the day at 9.75%. That was up from 
8.875% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar slumped in skittish trading as investors worried that West Germany 
might raise its interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the dollar was buffeted by rumors the Federal Reserve was 
intervening in the market to push the already weak U.S. currency lower. 
</P>
<P>
Also troubling traders was the prospect that the West German central bank, the 
Bundesbank, would move interest rates in that country higher today. Such a 
move, unless matched in this country by the Fed, would likely weaken the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas dealers said Saturday's planned meeting of financial officials from 
the Group of Seven industrial nations added to traders' qualms. The market was 
concerned that participants in the meeting might want to see the dollar 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against the British pound. In London, sterling was quoted at 
$1.5820, up from $1.5720 late Tuesday, and in later New York trading it was 
quoted at $1.5835, up from $1.5710. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.52 yen to a closing 146.25 yen. Later, in London, 
it dipped to 145.55 yen and in New York, it slipped to 145.10 yen from late 
Tuesday's 145.85. 
</P>
<P>
In gold trading in New York, an ounce of the precious metal picked up $3.70 to 
close at $364.90 in trading on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank 
later quoted a bid of $363.60 for an ounce of gold, up $3.60 from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold traded late in London at a bid price of $363.25 an ounce, up from $360.50 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Zurich, Switzerland, the closing bid price was $363.50, up from $360.50 late 
Tuesday and in earlier Hong Kong trading, gold fell 34 cents to close at a bid 
$361.42 a ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Silver rose 5.8 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $5.119 
an ounce. In earlier London trading, silver was quoted at a bid price of $5.13 
an ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.09. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures prices surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange 
amid developments that at least momentarily appeared to improve the chances for 
a resumption of export quotas to support coffee prices. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, futures prices for energy, precious metals, grains and pork 
all advanced, while cattle futures prices declined. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures settled 1.88 to 3 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in December at 82.55 cents a pound of green, unroasted coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The market, which had languished for most of the day, surged late in the 
session on news that President Bush had offered support to Colombian President 
Virgilio Barco for a revival of coffee export quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee prices have fallen by about a third, hurting Colombia's economy, since 
the International Coffee Organization suspended export quotas in July due 
largely to U.S. dissatisfaction with the system. 
</P>
<P>
But the market quickly lost interest in the letter from Bush after learning the 
President had not altered the United States' previously stated conditions for 
rejoining the coffee pact: no more sales of coffee to non-member nations and 
greater availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans. 
</P>
<P>
The letter quickly was replaced by another ostensibly bullish factor -- a 
report that Jorge Cardenas, president of the Colombia National Coffee 
Federation, would meet in Washington on Friday with U.S. trade negotiator 
Robert Murphy before both of them travel to London for a two-week meeting of 
the International Coffee Organization beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The report renewed speculation that U.S.-Colombian cooperation would lead to a 
new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, led by the 
gasoline market on fears of Hurricane Hugo's threat to refinery operations in 
the Caribbean Sea and the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver futures rose strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange in 
response to oil's gains and a weaker dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, 
boosted by fears of frost and hopes for new export sales of U.S. grain. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, frozen pork belly futures soared the 
2-cents-a-pound daily limit in a rally inspired by technical factors, analysts 
said.

HEAVY DEBT IS CASTING SHADOW OVER BREWER

Analysts paint a bleak future for G. Heileman Brewing Co., the nation's 
fifth-largest brewer and a big holding in the troubled empire of Australian 
industrialist Alan Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Bond on Tuesday unveiled a complex series of corporate maneuvers, including the 
planned sale of half his Australian brewery holdings, aimed at dealing with 
problems posed by the reported $4.6-billion debt that he ran up building a 
brewing, natural resources and media empire. 
</P>
<P>
One major holding is Heileman, which Bond acquired in 1987 for about $1.3 
billion. In announcing his plans, Bond deferred for 12 months any decision to 
part with Heileman, a sale that analysts said could end up being unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
While the overall beer market has stagnated, Heileman's share has eroded, 
falling from a high of 9.4% in 1983 to its current 7%. Industry observers say 
Heileman was worth far less than $1.3 billion when Bond bought it, and he will 
have a hard time fetching that price now. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not getting anyone to pay $1.3 billion for the breweries," said Ben 
Steinman, associate publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether you operate it and bleed a little or take a big hit 
and move on," said John Collopy, an industry analyst and chairman of the 
Milwaukee investment firm Cleary Gull Reiland McDevitt &amp; Collopy Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts point out that sales for Heileman -- whose brands include Old Style, 
Lone Star, Special Export and Colt 45 malt liquor -- started to slip before 
Bond acquired it but that former Chairman Russell Cleary had been able to keep 
the company efficient and profitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discouraged by Problems 
</P>
<P>
"His helmsmanship helped hold it together better than anyone could," said 
Collopy. "When you lose that, the underlying softness got exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
Cleary, who built the company into a national power through a series of 
acquisitions, says he is discouraged by the troubles that Heileman has 
encountered since the Bond buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate," Cleary said in a telephone interview.

RETAIL SALES REPORT SHOWS BEST GAINS IN OIL PATCH, WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sales at chain stores have grown faster this year in Oil Patch states than 
elsewhere in the country, while West Coast retailers have done better than 
their East Coast rivals, according to a report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Department stores and discounters in the El Paso metropolitan area posted the 
best sales gain for the first half of 1989 while Akron, Ohio, retailers 
suffered the worst decline. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were in a regional retail sales report based on results from 6,000 
stores, with at least 25 employees each, in the 125 largest U.S. metropolitan 
areas. The stores account for $110 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
The retailers, which regularly submit sales figures to the U.S. Census Bureau, 
include such national chains as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., K mart Corp. and J. 
C. Penney Co. 
</P>
<P>
Using data collected by the Census Bureau, the International Council of 
Shopping Centers is compiling a new monthly report that complements other 
government retail sales publications. The premiere issue covered sales for June 
and the first six months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Ike Lagnado, director of research for the shopping center trade group, said the 
report indicates a region's health because consumer spending at general 
merchandise stores is a key element of economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Loeb, a retail industry analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said at a 
news conference that the new reports will help analysts determine store traffic 
trends and sales momentum, which are crucial factors in assessing a retailer's 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report for January through June, the West South Central or Oil 
Patch area of the country -- including parts of Texas, Louisana, Arkansas and 
Oklahoma -- had a sales gain of 11.2% over the 1988 period. 
</P>
<P>
The increase was by far the best of any region and compared to a national 
median increase of 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the oil-dominated economies have suffered through an extended widespread 
economic contraction, a recent turnaround has apparently been sufficient to 
usher in a wave of consumer spending," the report read. 
</P>
<P>
The West had a 6.3% sales gain in the first half of 1989. On the East Coast, 
the south Atlantic states showed a growth rate of only 1.3% and the New England 
states trailed all other divisions within geographic regions, with a 2.6% drop.

Japan's No. 2 auto maker Nissan Motor Co. announced Wednesday a three-point 
plan to reduce exports, increase overseas production and expand imports, 
including finished vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement coincided with newspaper reports that the government will urge 
auto makers and electronics and machinery makers not to take advantage of the 
weakening value of the Japanese yen to mount an export drive for fear of 
escalating trade friction between Japan and the United States.

WHEN AN OFFICER CAN USE FIREARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time police draw their side arms and shotguns in the line of duty, a host 
of laws and guidelines are supposed to come into play before the officer 
decides to pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
While rules governing the use of deadly force differ among departments, most 
firearms policies are designed to give officers discretion, but in all cases 
there must be an immediate danger to themselves, hostages or innocent 
bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no hard-and-fast rules," said Lt. Jim Mulvihill, a training officer 
for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "All situations cannot be 
anticipated, so generalization of policy is unavoidable." 
</P>
<P>
Basically, law enforcement officials said, state law allows police to shoot 
someone in self-defense or to protect others when the officer has a 
well-founded belief that the threat of injury or death is immediate. If so, 
officers can use all the force necessary to end the danger. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, police may shoot at fleeing felons as long as the suspect, whether 
armed or not, presents a danger to the public or has committed a violent crime, 
such as murder, rape, robbery or mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
Before opening fire, officers also must consider the age of the suspect, where 
they are shooting, the type of crime committed, what they know about the crime 
and suspect, and whether an alternative to deadly force is available. 
</P>
<P>
Firing from a moving patrol car is prohibited in most situations, as is 
shooting at a moving vehicle unless the car, truck or motorcycle is being used 
as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to make the rules so rigid that an officer has to think too 
much. If he does, he could be a dead man," said Officer Douglas Miller, a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
With some modifications, the rules are in wide use throughout police agencies 
in Southern California and Orange County, including the Santa Ana Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a Santa Ana officer shot and killed Ernest Henry Nunez, 31, of 
Orange, a suspect in a clothing store robbery. Nunez, hit in the back with a 
shotgun blast while fleeing from police, was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say whether someone has a weapon is important but not 
always crucial in the decision to shoot. Unarmed suspects can be violent either 
on or off drugs. Police might also perceive a threat if they have reports that 
someone might have used a weapon previously, even if they cannot actually see a 
gun or knife on the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the person has a gun or not leaves a lot up in the air," Miller said. 
"If the person has just committed several murders and is fleeing, it's likely 
he's a danger to the community, and you need rules that will allow you to do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mulvihill said, if the fleeing person is a key suspect in a 
multiple-murder case but does not pose an immediate danger to the public, an 
officer might not be justified in shooting the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person doesn't pose an immediate threat, I'd say no," Mulvihill said. 
"But if the guy has shot someone and fired at another person down the street, 
you had better take positive action." 
</P>
<P>
When an officer decides to shoot, the general policy is to end the threat as 
quickly as possible. Warning shots are not allowed because of the danger to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"If the officer feels he is justified and morally right to make the decision to 
shoot, the idea is to remove the threat and remove it completely," said Capt. 
Bruce Young of the Huntington Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare themselves for that eventuality, officers undergo hundreds of hours 
of classroom instruction and live-fire training at police academies and at 
their departments. Periodic refresher courses and proficiency tests are 
required. 
</P>
<P>
After being involved in a shooting, the officer is generally put on desk duty 
while police department investigators, shooting review boards and the district 
attorney's office try to determine whether the officer violated department 
policy.

U.S. REPORT SAYS GENETIC ENGINEERING OF ORGANISMS IS SAFE 
</P>

<P>
Organisms produced by genetic engineering techniques are fundamentally no 
different from those produced by conventional crossbreeding and are "not 
inherently dangerous," according to a report issued Wednesday by a special 
committee of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
For tests of some microorganisms that have a potential to threaten the 
environment, the committee recommended introduction of a "suicide gene" that 
would cause the mutated bacteria or virus to self-destruct after the test. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, there is no need for a major revision of existing rules governing 
the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment, the 
committee said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the decision to release engineered plants, bacteria and viruses into 
the environment "should focus on the characteristics of the plant or 
microorganism itself, not the techniques used to create it," said biochemist 
Robert H. Burris of the University of Wisconsin, chairman of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Engineered plants are especially safe, the committee said, because they 
"rarely, if ever, escape to cause problems in the natural ecosystem." Release 
of microorganisms requires more study, but "no adverse effects have developed" 
from such introductions in the past, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Since the techniques of genetic engineering were first developed 15 years ago, 
controversy about the potential danger has surrounded it. Critics have charged 
that mutated bacteria or plants released into the environment during tests 
could escape and produce an ecological disaster. The new report seems to 
discount those objections. 
</P>
<P>
But activist Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a long-time 
opponent of genetic engineering, attacked the report as "irresponsible public 
policy," charging that the committee was motivated by "politics, not science." 
</P>
<P>
To date, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection 
Agency have issued about 80 permits for field testing of engineered organisms, 
most of them plants. But officials expect much larger numbers of applications 
in the future because of the great potential of genetically engineered 
organisms. 
</P>
<P>
Applications currently being pursued include bacteria that would degrade 
environmental pollutants and extract metals from ores, food plants that would 
flourish under dry or salty conditions, viruses that would control insect pests 
and crops that would resist weed killers and pests and, eventually, produce 
their own fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was created last year by the academy at the request of federal 
regulatory agencies to determine whether new rules should be developed for 
evaluating the growing number of applications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Field Testing 
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that "society has benefited greatly from the use of genetically 
modified microorganisms and plants" and that field testing of new species "is 
essential" for the development of still better species. 
</P>
<P>
The testing of genetically engineered plants, they concluded, is particularly 
hazard free because scientists have already tested "hundreds of millions of 
genotypes . . . over decades" with no adverse effects. 
</P>
<P>
The report said genetically engineered plants may be safer than those produced 
by crossbreeding because the gene transfer is more precise. 
</P>
<P>
"The (genetic) techniques are . . . more predictable than the classical 
methods," Burris said at a Washington press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have argued that the biggest risk of field testing such plants is that 
they will escape and become weeds. But the committee concluded that the 
physiological characteristics that enable plants to thrive as weeds have been 
bred out of the crop species that researchers are experimenting on so that 
there is little risk that such plants could survive if they escaped from test 
plots. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, there is no need to change the way such experimental tests are 
evaluated, the committee concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"The laws as they exist now are adequate for this," said panel member Edward L. 
Korwek of the Washington-based law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have less experience with microorganisms, the panel said, but 
ecological uncertainties can be addressed by considering the changed properties 
of the microorganisms, in addition to such environmental considerations as 
nutrient availability. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the panel concluded that the fear of creating hazardous 
microorganisms, or pathogens, is overstated. 
</P>
<P>
"It is highly unlikely that moving one or a few genes from a pathogen to an 
unrelated nonpathogen will confer on the recipient the ability to cause 
disease," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
If the microorganisms being studied are potentially hazardous, risk could be 
minimized by using suicide genes, "specific genes that would do their job and 
drop dead," said panel member Richard E. Lenski, an ecologist from UC Irvine. 
Committee members conceded that such suicide genes are not yet available, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the panel concluded, the familiarity of researchers with the 
experimental organisms and the altered genes is the best criterion to use in 
evaluating field-test proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Field tests . . . can go forward when sufficient information exists to permit 
evaluation of the relative safety or risk of the test." 
</P>

250 PROTEST LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE CO. URGED TO TURN CANYON INTO A 'CENTRAL PARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
More than 250 opponents of a proposed planned community at the mouth of Laguna 
Canyon packed a public meeting Wednesday night, urging Irvine Co. officials to 
turn the 2,150-acre rolling countryside into a "Central Park of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. executives and county officials scheduled the 7 p.m. study session 
at El Morro Elementary School on Coast Highway in Laguna Beach to explain to 
the public the findings of an environmental impact report on the proposed 
Laguna Laurel Planned Community. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. first proposed the 3,200-home upscale community in 1981 and is 
in the final stages of the lengthy permit process. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Irvine Co. officials distributed a mailer to Laguna Beach residents 
to counter strong criticism of the project, which would be built in the Laguna 
Greenbelt area. The pamphlet was titled, "Laguna Laurel, a gift that preserves 
the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Wednesday night session, Laguna Beach city officials and local 
environmentalists ridiculed the pamphlet, saying it was "deceptive and 
misleading." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid if we accept this gift from the Irvine Co., it will turn into a 
Trojan horse," said Councilwoman Lida Lenney. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert F. Gentry agreed, saying: "If that's a gift for the city of Laguna 
Beach, I'll send it back unopened. We don't want it. We don't need it, and the 
people of Orange County don't need it either." 
</P>
<P>
Gentry and others suggested that the Irvine Co. move all development in the 
Laguna Laurel project area to the Irvine Spectrum, a development under way near 
the convergence of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Foes of the project charge that any construction would upset the 
environmentally sensitive Laguna Greenbelt area, a swath of undeveloped crests 
and valleys that act as a buffer zone between Laguna Beach and the rest of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and leaders of the Laguna Canyon Conservancy and Laguna 
Greenbelt Inc. say that county officials have long ignored residents' pleas to 
reject the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday night meeting was the culmination of a series of demonstrations 
against the project. 
</P>
<P>
After spending a week picketing in front of the Newport Beach home of Irvine 
Co. Chairman Donald Bren, opponents moved picket lines to Laguna Canyon Road 
this week. They argue that the proposed site is a valuable natural resource for 
Orange County residents and should be preserved as a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday night's meeting, however, Irvine Co. consultants and county 
officials explained the results of a recently released environmental impact 
report, which outlines 136 ways to lessen the impact of the development on the 
rural countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Two public hearings, tentatively set for November, will be held by the Orange 
County Planning Commission, Irvine Co. project director Carol Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Orange County Board of Supervisors approves the project, construction 
could begin by the fall of 1990, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
The project would include a shopping center, an 18-hole golf course and 
recreational and park areas, and would be close to the Spectrum, a commercial, 
office and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the meeting, Hoffman accused opponents of "creating the 
illusion" that the company is insensitive to environmental issues. Hoffman 
defended the pamphlet, which claims that more than two-thirds of the wooded, 
hilly canyon area that stretches almost to the San Diego Freeway would be 
preserved as open space. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna Laurel is the result of years of careful planning, public hearings and 
extensive community comment," the pamphlet says. 
</P>
<P>
"The gift of land will help complete a 23-square-mile public greenbelt" around 
Laguna Beach, according to the pamphlet, which was printed on recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's study session, Irvine officials said the initial plan has 
been changed so that all housing would be built in the northernmost section of 
the project area, which is bounded on the north and west by Irvine, on the 
south by Crystal Cove State Park and Laguna Beach, and on the east by Leisure 
World. 
</P>
<P>
The project also encompasses Laguna Lakes, a three-lake system that will be 
donated to the county for a regional park, according to Irvine Co. documents. 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet also says Laguna Canyon Road will be widened as a result of the 
project, making the canyon route safer for motorists. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Laguna Beach City Council members unanimously approved a plan 
Tuesday night to pay for the production of pamphlets critical of the project by 
Laguna Greenbelt Inc. Those pamphlets will be mailed to residents of Laguna 
Beach, Irvine, Leisure World and Laguna Hills, City Clerk Verna L. Rollinger 
said.

TRUCK PLUNGES INTO CREEK BED, TRAPS DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mounting a 90-minute rescue effort that enlisted everything from massive tow 
trucks to an airborne surgeon, county firefighters Wednesday pried a man from 
the tangled wreckage of a flatbed truck after it plunged down a steep canyon 
road into a 15-foot-deep creek bed near Cook's Corner north of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver, Eustaquio Chavez Gonzalez, 39, of Whittier, was in serious 
condition with multiple fractures and internal injuries at Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters arrived, the three-axle truck, which was loaded with scrap 
lumber, was wedged nose-first into the eastern embankment of Alisos Creek. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tow Trucks Called In 
</P>
<P>
After unsuccessfully trying to free Gonzalez with a hydraulic prying device and 
other equipment, rescue crews were forced to call in a pair of heavy-duty tow 
trucks to pull the flatbed away from the creek bank so they could reach the 
severely injured driver in its mangled cab. 
</P>
<P>
As the rescue effort stretched into its second hour, authorities took the 
unusual step of ferrying in a trauma surgeon by helicopter in case Gonzalez 
required more intensive medical attention than that normally provided by 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the more complicated extractions I've been to in 10 or 12 
years," said Battalion Chief Bill Dean of the Orange County Fire Department. 
"It really required a maximum effort by all involved to get that man out of 
that truck." 
</P>
<P>
The episode unfolded about 9:30 a.m. when Gonzalez headed down Ridgeline Road 
with a load of scrap lumber from a nearby construction site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faulty Brakes Believed Cause 
</P>
<P>
As he steered down the steep route, the truck's brakes apparently failed, 
according to Officer Ken Daily, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. The 
flatbed careened through a red light at El Toro Road, nearly smashing into a 
car, then plowed through a pair of telephone boxes, knocking out service for 
several hours to more than 100 nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
It finally flew into the creek bed and rammed the opposite embankment, burying 
the blunt nose of the vehicle and pinning Gonzalez inside, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
After county firefighters were unable to free the trapped truck driver with 
hand-held extraction equipment, officials called in the county Fire 
Department's heavy rescue vehicle, a jumbo-size tow truck outfitted with a 
variety of winches and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Later, another vehicle, this one owned by a truck-towing firm in Santa Ana, 
lumbered to the scene to help pull the flatbed far enough up the creek bank 
that rescuers could reach Gonzalez, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, paramedics were watching the minutes tick away as Gonzalez 
remained trapped in the truck. Dean said medical personnel were particularly 
concerned when the time-consuming rescue operation passed the so-called "golden 
hour," the pivotal first 60 minutes after an accident when odds are best that a 
life can be saved by trauma surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
A Lifeflight helicopter was already on the scene, but when paramedics grew 
worried that Gonzalez was losing too much blood, the chopper was dispatched to 
Mission Hospital to get additional help. 
</P>
<P>
It returned carrying whole blood and Dr. Ralph Maeda, a surgeon at the 
hospital's trauma department. Dean said Maeda was flown in "just in case" more 
intensive medical efforts were needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Blood is not normally carried or administered by paramedics," Dean explained. 
"We were concerned that if we couldn't get him out quickly, we'd have to do 
something above and beyond the normal paramedic procedures." 
</P>
<P>
When the tow trucks pulled the flatbed away from the embankment, firefighters 
forced open the door on the driver's side and plucked Gonzalez from the 
wreckage. He was then flown to Mission Hospital with Maeda and paramedics 
providing care along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"He hung in there," Dean said of Gonzalez. "He was a trouper." 
</P>
<P>
Dean credited "a real team effort" among paramedics, firefighters, the 
Lifeflight helicopter crew and medical personal at Mission Hospital for saving 
the life of Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys really worked hard, the Lifeflight team worked hard and the base 
hospital gave some really good instructions," Dean said. "It was just a real 
good cooperative effort. Everything fell into place."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LA HABRA; 
</P>
<P>
CITY TO LAUNCH GANG PREVENTION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has unveiled a $51,034 Preventive Gang Activity Program that officials 
hope will spare La Habra some of the drug and gang violence so common in other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Lee Risner said gang activity in La Habra is limited to about 12 
individuals and "a substantial percentage of this number is incarcerated or 
(about) to stand trial for various incidents." 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that an additional "75 to 100 young people, predominately males, 
might have some propensity" to become gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Risner said the city, the La Habra City School District and the Neighborhood 
Housing Service of La Habra have joined forces to organize the program. A 
$25,000 grant will be combined with local funds to provide educational and 
counseling services to fourth- and fifth-grade students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glen D. Hayes, executive director of the Neighborhood Housing Service, said the 
program "is designed to expose the reality of gang activity and its serious 
effects which in some cases are fatal." 
</P>
<P>
The program provides $27,000 for a counselor who will meet with school children 
as well as neighborhood groups in the El Campo, Grace Pacific, and Alta Vista 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has initiated another program targeting youths who are 
identified to be "at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Plascencia, newly hired youth and community services coordinator, 
indicated that the program will include direct interaction with students as 
well as involvement of parents and community agencies, including the clergy.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PERMIT FOR HOME DENIED AFTER CRIME 
COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to complaints from neighbors, the City Council has voted unanimously to 
deny a request to build a single-family home in a district plagued by crime and 
beset by problems with undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action came Tuesday night after 10 residents of the area around 
Walnut Street south of Chapman Avenue gave emotional testimony, saying the 
two-story home, like others in the neighborhood, would be used as a 
boardinghouse for illegal aliens, and that might lead to more crime in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Albidrez, a Walnut Street resident, said that a code enforcement 
officer inspects homes in the area "in less than a minute" and that police 
reports listing complaints are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of communication between city officials and this community is 
disgraceful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor pro Tem Norman Z. Eckenrode and Councilman John O. Tynes both decided to 
vote against the construction permit request after a representative of the lot 
owner told the council that the house would be used as a rental.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRIVATE FIRM CONTRACTED FOR 
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will turn to the private sector in an effort to avoid what it believes 
are excessive new charges for emergency handling of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council authorized City Manager Lee Risner and City Atty. Richard D. 
Jones to enter into a contract for handling hazardous materials with Disposal 
Control Services Inc. by Oct 1. 
</P>
<P>
For the past five years, the service has been provided free by Anaheim. 
Effective Oct. 1, however, the service will cost $68,400 annually. 
</P>
<P>
The free services had grown out of an agreement among Orange County cities to 
support grant proposals by five of the county's largest fire departments for 
hazardous materials equipment, training and personnel. Those departments are 
Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Santa Ana and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, those agencies established a joint powers agreement and 
determined that charges should be imposed to cover rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by La Habra, units assigned to hazardous 
materials duties also respond to other types of emergencies. This led the city 
and a number of other communities with their own fire departments to conclude 
that the costs were too high and that fewer units were needed to meet needs. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan to contract for services approved by the City Council on 
Tuesday, Fire Department personnel will also receive hazardous materials 
training, while the option of calling on Anaheim for emergencies beyond the 
capabilities of the private company will be retained.

HIT-RUN DRIVER KILLS FULLERTON PEDESTRIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton police Wednesday were seeking the driver of a Cadillac that struck 
and killed a pedestrian as he crossed a street against a red light and a 
flashing "Don't Walk" signal. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Wayne Dale, who is investigating the accident, said a pale-yellow 
Cadillac struck the unidentified man about 1:45 p.m. as he crossed southbound 
on Highland Avenue at Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The man was hurled onto the windshield, then thrown 95 feet as the car traveled 
west on Orangethorpe, Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
The force of the impact knocked the man out of his socks and shoes, Dale said. 
Police have not yet identified the victim. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the Cadillac sped away. Police have no description of the driver 
but said the car is a two-door model manufactured between the years 1979 and 
1982.

LA HABRA HIRING TEACHERS TO MEET GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing an unexpected increase in enrollment, the La Habra City School District 
is hiring two more teachers for classes that are expected to begin early next 
month, bringing to 11 the number of new teachers hired to absorb the jump in 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
In all, enrollment this year has been put at 4,500 students, or 250 more than 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The district already had hired nine new teachers, but a more accurate first-day 
enrollment count showed the need for two more classes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new instructors will teach a kindergarten class at El Cerrito Elementary 
and a first-grade class at Ladera Palma Elementary. A new portable classroom 
should be added at Ladera Palma by Oct. 2, the day the new teachers will begin 
teaching classes. 
</P>
<P>
Because of retirements and resignations, new teachers now make up 15% of the 
district's faculty, the highest influx of new instructors in recent history, 
district officials said. And despite the shrinking pool of prospective 
teachers, the district filled its 33 vacancies without expanding its scope of 
recruitment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had good success with our relationships with Cal State Fullerton, 
Whittier College and other institutions," said district Supt. Rich Hermann. 
"Student teachers who are placed with us for practical experience in their last 
year of training often end up applying for positions in our district." 
</P>
<P>
Hermann said the student population statewide is growing by about 160,000 a 
year. A serious shortage of teachers is inevitable unless more young people 
decide to enter the profession, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the La Habra district's enrollment has climbed steadily. 
However, long-term projections extending to the year 2010 conclude that the 
district will never reach the peak enrollment of 6,600 students it had in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The district also announced that $708,310 in state lottery funds will allow the 
continuation of 21 special instruction programs and the incorporation of nine 
new programs. 
</P>
<P>
The money provides additional classroom materials for math and language arts as 
well as two new music teachers. The money will also provide funds for a youth 
and community services coordinator, who will work with students at risk of 
dropping out of school or becoming involved with gangs.

TWO-THIRDS RULE OUTDATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Orange County, where tax increases have always had trouble getting voter 
support, a majority of residents -- 57% according to a recent Times survey -- 
say they are ready to vote for higher taxes if the money goes to help schools. 
</P>
<P>
That result should please harried school officials struggling to meet booming 
enrollments with a shortage of classrooms and budgets too thin to cover their 
growing needs. But educators must contain their excitement because the sobering 
fact is that it still takes the approval of two-thirds of the voters, not a 
simple majority, to pass local tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, despite majority support for needed school-tax increases, local 
measures often fail. This happened last May when 52.2% of the voters in the 
Capistrano Unified School District approved a special tax-assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
The two-thirds requirement, in effect, gives tax increase opponents two votes 
and an unequal influence not afforded the voting minority in other elections. 
It is an archaic approach that was put in the state Constitution 110 years ago. 
It was needed then, when the state's financial condition was as unstable as its 
earthquake faults. Cities were defaulting on bonds and there was a general fear 
that people who didn't own property would tax those who did into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed. It is time to change the state Constitution, too, and 
replace the two-thirds requirement in local elections with the same simple 
majority that is needed in statewide bond issues. How much longer must schools 
do without the financial help most residents seem ready to provide?

MITCHELL MOVIN' ON UP; 
</P>
<P>
HE FINDS HOME IN LOS ALAMITOS' BACKFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Erik Mitchell can move. 
</P>
<P>
Right, and the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. After all, this guy 
runs a 4.3 in the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
Already this season, Mitchell has returned a kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown 
and scored on runs of 55 and 54 yards for Los Alamitos High School, which plays 
Villa Park tonight at Veterans Stadium. Last week against Servite, he gained 
245 yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
But not all of Mitchell's moves have turned into statistics. 
</P>
<P>
His family has moved several times. Sometimes the reasons have been hard for 
him to understand. Other times it has been as simple as football. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Mitchell returned home from a football camp to find everything packed 
and the motor running. His family, which had lived in Lakewood for two years, 
was moving out of their three-bedroom apartment into a house in Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first I heard of it," Mitchell said. "I came back and was told we 
were leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell knew his stepfather, Dave Cunningham, was interested in moving him out 
of Mayfair's attendance area. However, he said no one had told him they were 
moving so soon. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell didn't even know the destination at first. He assumed they were going 
to another part of town. Instead, he found himself in Los Alamitos and his 
third high school in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it hasn't been too hard on Mitchell. He has become used to moving. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's family has been on the go since he was in the fifth grade. In nine 
years, he has lived in five cities -- a couple of them twice -- and two states. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been too tough. I've made a lot of great friends," said Mitchell, a 
senior running back. "The only thing that's tough is getting used to the 
teachers. They all use a different grading system." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some of his moves, the family's last one was purely for football. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior at Mayfair, Mitchell rushed for 1,275 yards and scored 11 
touchdowns. A nice season, but who noticed? 
</P>
<P>
The Monsoons didn't go to the playoffs, they didn't have a winning record (3-7) 
and they finished at the bottom of the Suburban League standings. So Cunningham 
decided to seek a better situation for his son. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham wanted Mitchell to have the best for his senior year and the fact 
that this meant uprooting his family didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Erik was gaining all those yards mainly on his own," said Cunningham, a 
refrigerator mechanic for a soft drink company in Buena Park. "I'm not knocking 
Mayfair, but I wanted to see what Erik could do running behind a good offensive 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham first approached Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson, whose team was coming 
off a 8-3-1 season. Olson said Cunningham told him he was thinking of moving 
his family to another school district. 
</P>
<P>
Olson told him the Fighting Irish already had a crowded backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"If the guy's kid was good, he was going to get to play," Olson said. "But I 
felt a loyalty to the kids who had been in the program for four years. Most 
parents go overboard when they're trying to sell you on their son. Still, the 
guy was very nice. He was just looking out for the best interest of the kid." 
</P>
<P>
Mayfair Coach Leon Ward doesn't see it quite that way. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, who also coached Mitchell on the track and field team, isn't bitter. But 
he said he would have liked to have been better informed. 
</P>
<P>
"I first heard rumors that Erik was leaving before last football season," Ward 
said. "I talked with his parents and they guaranteed me they weren't leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell even went through spring drills with the Mayfair team. 
</P>
<P>
"We were preparing to build the whole offense around Erik," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
But word soon reached him that Cunningham was talking with other coaches. This 
time, Cunningham didn't deny it. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't start thinking about moving until the spring," Cunningham 
said. "I kind of wanted to move nearer to my work. That's why I went to Kennedy 
first." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ward: "I couldn't agree with Mr. Cunningham. I didn't think there was any 
reason to move. He was going to get a (college) scholarship even if he stayed. 
People were already looking at him." 
</P>
<P>
Oblivious to the situation was Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes, who said he'd 
never even heard of Erik Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"One day this guy comes up to me and said his kid was going to be attending Los 
Alamitos," Barnes said. "He said his kid was really fast and would be coming 
out for the football team. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I'm not into shopping kids around. If a kid is here legally, 
he's welcome to come out for the team. If he's great player, that's fine. If 
he's not, that's fine, too." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks later, Barnes was talking to a Mayfair assistant who was 
interested in moving to Los Alamitos as a freshman team coach. Barnes mentioned 
a player transferring from Mayfair who was supposed to be very fast. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy said, 'The only guy who's very fast at Mayfair is Erik Mitchell,' " 
Barnes said. "I said, 'That's the kid.' " 
</P>
<P>
The response on the other end of the telephone was more or less, "Holy Cow." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the first quarter against Marina, Mitchell fielded a kickoff 
on the 10-yard line and returned it for a touchdown. For the first time, Barnes 
realized just how fast Mitchell could run. 
</P>
<P>
"There were three Marina kids that had great angles at him," said Barnes, whose 
team is ranked No.1 in Orange County. "They were coming straight toward me and 
I could see the panic in their eyes. They knew they weren't going to get there 
in time to make the tackle. Erik was gone." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell began playing football when he was in the third grade in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"All he talked about was football," said Cora Cunningham, his mother. "He said 
he wanted to be the next Earl Campbell." 
</P>
<P>
Before Mitchell entered the fifth grade, his parents were divorced and Cora 
moved her family to Compton to live with her sister. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's mother went back to school and worked part-time. She found an 
apartment and moved her three children to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"California was a real shock for me," Erik said. "It was the first time I had 
ever run into gangs. I couldn't wear anything red in my neighborhood because 
the Crips would be all over me." 
</P>
<P>
Red is the color of the Bloods, a rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell kept his distance and learned the rules. Still, in that neighborhood, 
even the innocent could have problems. Drive-by shootings occurred within a 
block of the Mitchell's house. 
</P>
<P>
When Mitchell was in the seventh grade, his mother married Cunningham, who had 
three sons. Cunningham tried to steer all the children away from gangs and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But he was always more concerned about Erik. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared that Erik would get involved in a fight with some gang member," 
Cunningham said. "Erik is just the type of kid who won't back down. That could 
have caused some serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell spent his freshman year at Booker T. Washington High School in Houston 
to be closer to his father. But he came back a year later to more gang-related 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Just before his return, Jason Cunningham, Erik's stepbrother, was stopped by 
gang members and questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they hadn't seen him around before and wanted to know where he 
lived. That scared us," Dave Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
He moved the family to Mayfair a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
"We were both working, so the kids had to stay at home alone a lot," said Cora 
Cunningham, an electronic technician. "We just felt a lot better about leaving 
them at home in Mayfair." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell excelled at Mayfair High School in football and in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
He won the 200 meters at the Southern Section 2-A meet as a sophomore and might 
have won it as a junior had it not been for a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
But football has always been his favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
And football has helped Mitchell adjust. Quiet by nature, he said making 
friends has been easier because of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the first person he met over the summer was Todd Gragnano, Los 
Alamitos' quarterback. The two became close friends over the summer, going to 
movies and parties together. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd was a transfer from out of the area, so he understood what Erik was going 
through," Barnes said. "Erik was real nervous at first. He didn't say a lot and 
was having problems catching the football. I think Todd helped him over the 
rough spots." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said Mitchell was still pressing when the season began. Although he 
returned a kickoff for a touchdown, Mitchell gained only 29 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, behind Gragnano's passing, the Griffins won, 42-22. 
</P>
<P>
"During the game, I pulled Erik aside and told him, 'We've scored that many 
points and you really haven't done anything yet,' " Barnes said. "Just relax 
and play. We don't need you to do everything." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell relaxed last week and tore up the Servite defense. 
</P>
<P>
"There were kids who came up to tackle him, but Erik wasn't there anymore," 
Barnes said. "He's that fast."

MIND OVER MATTER: CONFIDENCE KEEPING RABBITT OFF FAST TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although her running career began with a simple pair of deck shoes, an 
inability to jog a mile and a dislike for the activity, UC Irvine's Buffy 
Rabbitt has become a two-time All-American with special potential. 
</P>
<P>
But when you speak of potential to Rabbitt, say the word in a whisper. Even 
though her coaches consider her a top runner on the collegiate level, the 
junior does not seem -- or want -- to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Irvine Coach Vince O'Boyle's conviction that she could run with the 
nation's best, including five-time NCAA champion Suzy Favor of Wisconsin, 
Rabbitt's eyes open wide. 
</P>
<P>
"Ha!" she said. "You know, maybe the mind is magic, and if I thought (about) it 
enough I could get to be that fast. But I don't envision it at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just the type of person who's just happy to improve -- even if I finish 
last." 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that Rabbitt, 20, a former Newport Harbor High School standout, 
never has finished last in a race. Last year, she was only six seconds behind 
Favor in the NCAA 1,500-meter final. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she became the school's first female All-American in cross-country, 
finishing 20th at the NCAA championships. The next spring, she earned 
All-American honors in track. Last year, she qualified for the Olympic Trials 
in the 1,500 meters, although she did not reach the final. 
</P>
<P>
Her success has brought attention, which the shy Rabbitt does not enjoy. 
Especially when her name becomes the inspiration for pun-filled headlines and 
stories. She insists she'd rather not be singled out, requesting instead to be 
viewed only as a part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
And her interests reach beyond sports. Rabbitt has a 3.6 grade-point-average 
and is pursuing a double major in comparative literature and psychology and a 
minor in French. She redshirted the 1988-89 school year, studying in 
Montpellier, France. 
</P>
<P>
During that year, Rabbitt gained an appreciation of other cultures and world 
events that she hadn't before considered. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things were too complicated, too foreign to me (before)," Rabbitt said. 
"I was interested in running, school, being with my friends. But I think you 
have to know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
As far as her outlook on running, Rabbitt is tentative. She says she does not 
often set goals -- "I'm not sure why, maybe fear of failure," -- nor does she 
even want to hear the words, 1992 Olympics, mentioned with her name. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time someone says that, I have to laugh," Rabbitt said. "I mean, it's so 
unrealistic. I think I would just be out of my head if I said, 'Yes, I am 
training for the 1992 Olympics. Yes, I will have a sponsor . . .' 
</P>
<P>
"If that ever does come to pass in my life, wonderful. Anyone would have to say 
that would be a great honor -- and a lot of work -- but I haven't given it a 
serious thought yet." 
</P>
<P>
Compare Rabbitt's current athletic status to her start in running, and you've 
got a career that's implausible by a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Rabbitt tried out for cross-country in the summer of her 
freshman year, although it was not her idea. Her mother thought joining the 
team would make the transition to high school easier. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt had little background in sports before she entered high school. 
Although she dabbled in ballet, and spent summer days with a youth activities 
group on Balboa Island swimming, diving, rowing and paddleboard racing -- "I 
was so bad at everything; I hated it," she says -- Rabbitt did not know what to 
expect from running. 
</P>
<P>
And when Newport Harbor Coach Eric Tweit saw this scrawny little girl wearing 
glasses and deck shoes approach him, he didn't know what to expect either. 
</P>
<P>
But after her first few weeks, Tweit was convinced of Rabbitt's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"She was flat out terrible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the very first day, we ask the kids to try to get down to the Coast Highway 
and back; it's seven-tenths of a mile. She could not make it. We had a basic 
three-mile run called 'Drinking Fountain.' She could not finish it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way in the world, after seeing her in her freshman year, that 
you'd think she'd ever be a four-year varsity member, much less an All-American 
in college." 
</P>
<P>
When the team set out for its annual training camp at Kings Canyon a few weeks 
later, Rabbitt went along, but when Tweit and co-coach Bob Van Sickle chose 
teams for a relay race, Rabbitt was left out. Van Sickle told her to try to run 
the figure-eight loop course with another runner. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rabbitt: "I was very hurt by this. I went up to Bob and said, 'You don't 
think I'm good enough, do you?' He was trying his best not to hurt me, but 
there was no way around it. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I ran my hardest. I just knew that for the first time, I was going to try 
really, really hard because I wanted to prove them wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tweit: "She took off really fast with this long stride. We were going, 
'What? This is Buffy? Someone stop her! She's gonna die!' She was passing 
people left and right. We'd never seen her run like that. It was incredible. 
She came back around and she was still going like that. We were just 
dumbfounded." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that she could finish a three-mile cross-country course in a 
race, she struggled to complete the distance on a training run. Among her 
coaches and teammates, very slow jogging came to be called the "Buffy Shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt, who is nearsighted, then wore glasses (she now has contact lenses). 
But because the glasses would fog up and slip around when she raced, Rabbitt 
would take them off midway through the race and carry them in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running a race at Eisenhower Park," Tweit said. "It was a crazy course 
with all kinds of turns and loops. The first girl got so far ahead of Buffy 
that we (coaches and teammates) had to split up and run all around the course 
saying, 'Buffy! Turn right! Buffy, go left!' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling you, her freshman year was bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
But in the next three years, Rabbitt became one of the county's best. As a 
junior, she led Newport Harbor to the Southern Section 4-A championship. As a 
senior, she was named The Times' female runner of the year in cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
But Rabbitt, admits her self-confidence never has been high. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I have some work to do in that regard," she said. "I really have lacked 
confidence in the past. When I ran the Olympic Trials, I hate to admit it, but 
I lost confidence and mentally gave up a little bit. I was overwhelmed and an 
experience like that makes me wonder, 'Am I able to take the pressure?' " 
</P>
<P>
O'Boyle is convinced she can. But she must start believing what has become a 
common belief: she has the ability to run very, very fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, she just hopes that she does well," O'Boyle said. "She doesn't look 
at herself as, 'I'm an All-American and I can run with anyone.' That's what she 
has to start thinking. She has to believe, 'I can compete with anyone.' Will 
she ever do that? I don't know. We'll have to see." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt, the 1987 Big West Conference cross-country champion, and senior Brigid 
Stirling, the 1988 Big West champion, lead the Anteaters this year. 
</P>

DANIEL SWINGING IN RIGHT DIRECTION AFTER FOUR-YEAR STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK WALTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beth Daniel has come to terms with her golf game. 
</P>
<P>
This is a golf game that includes a picturesque swing that, at its best, 
produces high approach shots that land with great frequency near the pin. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, 32, is reclaiming the top spot on the leader board more often than not 
these days. But the pressure that accompanies that orbit of achievement, which 
she couldn't always handle, is now a fact of life that she seems to accept with 
much more ease. 
</P>
<P>
At times in her illustrious career the immaculate swing has defied her. At 
other times the stress of being favored to win has backed her into an emotional 
corner from which it was impossible to swing. 
</P>
<P>
"Beth is coming off a four-year struggle, and now is a threat to win every 
single week," said Pat Bradley, who, with Daniel, is competing in the LPGA's 
Nippon Travel-MSB tournament at Los Coyotes that begins today. 
</P>
<P>
Before Daniel's victory in August in the Washington (D.C.) Open, she had not 
won an LPGA event since 1985 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Since winning in Washington, she has won two other tournaments, giving her 
three victories in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
This easily puts her among the favorites to win again this week and her game is 
ideally suited to the course. 
</P>
<P>
"Beth has a great chance to win here because she hits the ball very high and 
that's an advantage on a course with elevated greens like this one," said LPGA 
player Susan Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel's victory in Washington freed her from an almost crippling barrier that 
had built up over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel had finished second eight times in the past two years. Her swing had no 
discernible flaws and she was learning to master her temperment. 
</P>
<P>
With her victory in Washington came not a $45,000 paycheck, but something 
golfers will tell you money can't buy -- confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"In Washington I was able to break that barrier down," Daniel said. "Last week, 
in particular, I wasn't nervous, nothing. It didn't matter if I won, came in 
second, third, fourth, whatever. I'd already won twice, I've had a great year. 
So there was no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel is feeling good about her chances this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good golf course for me. I like the layout very much. Actually, I 
was really tired coming in here after the past few weeks and I was thinking 
about withdrawing, but my caddy told me I should stay in it because this is a 
very good course for me. And it is. And after playing the practice round, I'd 
say it definitely is." 
</P>
<P>
LPGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel says eight-under par is a score that should win the tournament. . . 
. The players are generally excited about the layout of the course, which is 
hillier than they are accustomed to. The fairways are in good condition and 
course superintendent Bill Gallegos has had his crews working into the night, 
trying to get some greens into shape that had been damaged by fungus this 
summer. Players say the greens are now quite playable.

STATE TO INVESTIGATE ACCOUNTING FIRMS FOR LINCOLN S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state agency will investigate three major accounting firms that worked on 
financial statements for insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine to 
determine if they were negligent, a state Board of Accountancy official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board will initiate its investigation of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., Arthur 
Young &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp; Co. within the "next few weeks," said 
Gregory J. Newington, the agency's enforcement program director. The Arthur 
Young firm merged with Ernst &amp; Whinney earlier this year and now is known 
as Ernst &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators, who filed a $1.1-billion racketeering suit last week 
against Lincoln's former operators, also are investigating the role of those 
accounting firms in Lincoln's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The racketeering suit levels a harsh blast at Arthur Young and Jack D. 
Atchison, one of its partners in Phoenix who quit last year to work for 
Lincoln's parent company, Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. Though it 
does not name either as a defendant, the suit nevertheless claims that they 
misrepresented Lincoln's condition in a 1987 letter to a public official. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, together with the intervention of U.S. senators called in by 
American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating, a heavy contributor to 
political campaigns, "protracted the examination process and afforded 
(operators) additional time in which to exacerbate their frauds" on Lincoln and 
regulators, according to the racketeering suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand behind the audits," said Eugene Erbstoesser, Arthur Young's associate 
general counsel in Los Angeles. He denied that the accounting firm did anything 
wrong either in responding to public officials or in auditing Lincoln's and 
American Continental's books. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the accountancy board for revealing its investigation 
through the media. He said his firm had not been notified yet about the board's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and spokesmen for the other two accounting firms could not be reached 
for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental 
filed for bankruptcy. Industry experts claim that the S&amp;L, which has since 
been declared insolvent, will cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion, which would 
make it the most expensive thrift bailout ever. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the accounting firms, particularly Arthur Young, were roundly 
criticized in a review by the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. of 
15 major real estate transactions at Lincoln. Regulators hired Leventhal to 
conduct the review. 
</P>
<P>
Leventhal claimed that more than half of Lincoln's income since American 
Continental bought it in 1984 was manufactured through "accounting gimmickry." 
Leventhal claimed it had seldom seen "a more egregious example" of misapplied 
accounting standards. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, lawsuits filed by investors against corporate insiders and their 
advisers, including the accounting firms, claim that favorable audits helped to 
stall regulators for more than a year in their effort to seize Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In that time American Continental sold nearly $200 million of high-risk 
subordinated debentures, essentially corporate IOUs, through Lincoln's 29 
Southern California branches to some 22,000 investors. Now, the investors 
expect their holdings to be wiped out in the bankruptcy proceedings in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
They also plan to file a lawsuit this week against the state Department of 
Corporations for its role in approving the sale of those debentures. Earlier 
this month, the agency rejected a $250-million claim filed against the state. 
</P>
<P>
Newington said the accountancy board's investigation will center on Arthur 
Andersen, which audited the thrift's books through 1985, and Arthur Young, 
which audited the books for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The board also will look at Touche Ross, which was hired to help American 
Continental prepare the report on its third-quarter results last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 1988 third-quarter report that provided the first dramatic public 
evidence of trouble at the thrift and American Continental. The company wanted 
to record a $56-million profit as part of what it claimed was an $81-million 
profit from the increased value of stock a Lincoln subsidiary held after a swap 
of stock interests with British financier Sir James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Young disagreed and quit over the issue. Its replacement, Touche Ross, 
suggested getting approval from various regulators before booking the profit. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the attempt to book 
the profit. Lincoln then posted a $20-million quarterly loss, and the company 
reported a consolidated quarterly loss of $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Newington said Touche Ross' involvement in Lincoln may be "on the periphery" 
but will still be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
He said the accountancy board decided to look into the role of the accounting 
firms after reading press reports about lawsuits filed by investors against the 
operators of Lincoln and their advisers, including the three accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Phoenix offices of the accounting firms ultimately passed on the 
audits and other accounting work, he said, licensed certified public 
accountants in their California offices also handled parts of the audit. The 
fact that some of the work was done in California gives the board jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Any wrongdoing the agency finds could result in sanctions ranging from public 
admonishments and fines to suspension or revocation of individuals' licenses, 
he said. Previous probes against licensed accountants at major firms have 
resulted in "substantial restrictions," short of revocations, against 
individuals and the firms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation into Lincoln's outside accountants likely will take "many, 
many months, perhaps a year or so," he said.

THE JURY IS STILL OUT BUT VIDEO GAMES ARE SURE TO BE IN FOR A LONG TIME 
</P>

SAN ANSELMO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had been with him through a wardrobe door to Narnia, and down a rabbit hole 
to Wonderland. So when my 12-year-old son disappeared into a television screen 
beyond my calls for dinner, curiosity led me to explore the world that lay on 
the other side. I come back transformed by both wonder and horror, as I believe 
our children do. I had vastly underestimated the significance of that journey, 
as I believe most parents do. 
</P>
<P>
The PacMan wave came and went. A second wave has hit like a tsunami. These are 
the first games in history to interact with artificial intelligence, and it 
appears that this time they are here to stay. Video games have been the 
greatest-selling toy in the United States for the last two years. As many 
American homes are equipped for video-game playing as have compact-disc 
players. 
</P>
<P>
David Fox, a computer game designer for Lucasfilm, says: "We're in a stage now 
like the first talking movies. In 10 or 20 years, the games will simulate movie 
experiences with full animation and sound." 
</P>
<P>
Video games can be absorbing -- some even say hypnotizing or addicting. 
Rosemary LePage, a school psychologist for Marin County, gathered reports from 
children who said they played video games for 10 to 40 hours per week. What's 
the attraction? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Is Fast 
</P>
<P>
Involvement is active, not passive as with television. Play is in real time, 
and the action is fast. Children are empowered with control over extraordinary 
events that allow them to master entire worlds. Progressive levels of skill 
keep the challenge of the games accessible. 
</P>
<P>
There is intense vicarious experience, unlike the old PacMan game, where the 
player never "became the dot." Transcendence is part of the appeal; flying, 
transformation, disappearance take a flick of a finger. Fox says: "When I 
design a game, I create a universe which . . . suspends belief about being in 
the real world. I try to put a person into a position he wouldn't face 
normally, so he . . . would see the consequences if he makes a certain choice." 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey and Elizabeth Loftus, cognitive psychologists at the University of 
Washington, suggest other elements in "Mind at Play: The Psychology of Video 
Games." Games are designed with intermittent rather than continuous 
reinforcement, they say, "a powerful way of hooking rats and people" and the 
method used for programming slot machines. The chance to correct error is a 
powerful motivation to continue, and huge scores assure the player of the high 
value of a success. 
</P>
<P>
Set definitions are an important element of the attraction to children. "There 
is so much for a child to deal with that is not clear. . . . With practice the 
(game) task becomes clear, and it can be mastered or successfully controlled. 
This provides a great relief from frustrations of real life," according to 
LePage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Maturing Experience 
</P>
<P>
Because a computer cannot be manipulated beyond its program, a child has to 
substitute rational thinking for cajoling -- a maturing experience, says 
Gilbert Levin, a professor of psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine in New York. He maintains that fears of addiction, withdrawal, and 
passivity in video game-playing children are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
The opposite view is taken by Thomas Radecki, a psychiatrist and research 
director of the National Coalition on Television Violence, who says: "Parents 
would be wise to ban video games from the home. They are very captivating, 
often violent, and certainly a waste of time." Doug Tortorigi, a game merchant 
trained in hypnosis, observes that the games have a powerful effect on 
children, and "people need to come to terms with what this technology can do -- 
both positive and negative." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes' time in a video arcade reveals its offerings. A child playing 
"Freedom Force" shoots at hijackers. When a hostage is killed instead, the 
screen blinks "error." A boy drives through the video streets of "City 
Connection," kills a pedestrian, and loses his car. But he gets another right 
away. I drop in a quarter and am under attack. My stomach tightens, my skin 
tingles, my eyes widen in alert intensity, and I fire at everything that moves. 
"Got 'em, the scum." Fear, relief, triumph. How could I think about dinner with 
my life at risk? 
</P>
<P>
"What makes a game great?" asks Compute! magazine. Its answers do not include 
responsible content. On the magazine's list of favorite games is "F-15 Strike 
Eagle," described thus: "Real life scenarios give you opponents from Libya, 
Syria, and Iran. Use your heat-seeking and radar-ranging missiles, cannons, and 
electronic jamming gear . . . nerve-wracking and fun at the same time." Fred 
Schmidt, an executive at MicroProse, producer of the game, says, "It's a way to 
find out what it felt like over Libya, and, the best part is . . . no one gets 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Does no one get hurt? Vince Hammond, a sociologist with the National Coalition 
on Television Violence, cites a controlled study of playground behavior of 600 
children that found aggressive behavior increased 80% on days the children 
played violent video games. A study of 5-year-olds described by UCLA psychology 
professor Patricia Greenfield found certain games increased aggressive play and 
decreased pro-social play. 
</P>
<P>
But the same researchers cited by Greenfield found that two-player games, 
whether cooperative or competitive, reduced the level of aggression in play and 
did not affect cooperative behavior. This lends credence to the argument 
advanced by some game producers that violent video games let kids work out 
hostilities. Greenfield concludes that the most harmful aspect of such games 
may be that they are solitary. 
</P>
<P>
But even if a child faces a hostile video world with a playmate, an important 
additional ingredient needs to be considered. Both television programs and 
video games are viewed on the same equipment. Televised news brings images of 
real planes crashing, real killing, real tragedy. Responses to those images 
contribute to a cultural attitude, which, in turn, influences the creation of 
the events pictured on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Desensitizing 
</P>
<P>
Can the game "Contra" be unscrambled from the real thing? The National 
Coalition on Television Violence sees violent video games as desensitizing. 
"You can't win these violent games with nonviolent tactics," says Hammond, who 
finds them fostering an increased acceptance of force as a means of dealing 
with conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to create a violent game," says game-designer Fox, "but I do 
think that there is some benefit to using a game to act something out, to 
finish something, or to explore something." Psychologist LePage also believes 
that video games can be cathartic; "There is deep satisfaction in the power, 
the control." She suggests that the key is for parents to supervise the choice 
of content. 
</P>
<P>
There is no official code, such as there is for films, to evaluate the sea of 
video games for children. Tortorigi has never seen a parent deny a child a game 
because of content. LePage suggests that many parents defer to children because 
they are less comfortable with computers than their youngsters, who have used 
them for years in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The parental decision with the greatest impact on the child involves the choice 
of equipment for play. There are three categories, which, to a large extent, 
determine content: 
</P>
<P>
* Arcade games. These are reflex-dependent action games. The predominant theme 
is survival by force in a hostile world. In a local video arcade, 33 out of 39 
games are violent. PacMan, an occasional maze game, and sports games like 
"Golf" and "Tennis" are examples of others. To gain enough mastery to complete 
a game on a single quarter (one hour) costs from $20 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
* Home video games. These are played with systems connected to a television. 
Nintendo, a 99-year-old Japanese firm, introduced its video-game system in 
1986; it is now the best-selling toy in the United States, taking the greatest 
share of what is expected to be a $2-billion video-game market this year. The 
National Coalition on Television Violence studied the 95 Nintendo games and 
found 83% had violent themes. Maze and role-playing games have lighter motifs 
("Super Mario Brothers") or fantasy and logic ("Zelda"). Home systems cost 
about $100 and games are around $40. 
</P>
<P>
* Games for personal computers. Some of these use the more primitive joy sticks 
or button controls of video games, but others require a keyboard. Although 
there are computer games of the arcade type, most are more complex and less 
visceral. Many require hours to play rather than minutes. There are whole 
genres of games to challenge an active mind -- magic and fantasy, mystery, 
science fiction, role-playing adventure games. The Rev. Steven Payne of the 
Carmelite Monastery in Washington, an avid computer-game player, sees them as 
"puzzles that talk back to you. They seem to appeal to an inborn capacity for 
wonder and play, a desire for transcendence. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Interactive fiction games for the computer offer text with adventures of J.R.R. 
Tolkein, Ray Bradbury, Arthur Clarke, Arthur Conan Doyle. These games require 
concentration, strategy, and logical thinking. Fox of Lucasfilm has designed 
"Zak McKracken," a clever and challenging adventure game in which the tools for 
success include a kazoo and a fish named Sushi. Personal computers cost from 
$800 and games range from those available free for a call to electronic 
"bulletin boards" to around $50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like a Foreign Culture' 
</P>
<P>
Commercial literature touts the skills acquired by children playing video 
games, and an adult who has been challenged by a child can face a formidable 
adversary. Greenfield found children so adept that she approached the subject 
"like an anthropologist in a foreign culture." "Moon Lander," a game found in a 
number of science museums, requires several elements to be controlled 
simultaneously to land a space ship: attitude, vertical speed, horizontal 
speed, direction, amount of fuel, terrain, acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
Game mastery requires development of such simultaneous integration, as well as 
hand-eye coordination, estimation, short-term and long-term memory, 
persistence, and problem-solving skills, which evolve out of trial and error. 
But how much of this transfers outside game-playing? 
</P>
<P>
Possibly none. Verbalization may be required for the transfer of concepts to a 
new domain, according to Greenfield. So reaping the benefits of the games may 
depend on making them subjects of discussion with parents or at school. 
</P>
<P>
Playing computer games can serve as an enticement to programming. There are 
game-making programs available. With only fundamental instruction, my son is 
creating his own maze game. One day he will be able to use his computer skills 
to control monsters of the real world. 
</P>
<P>
To see computer games begin to spawn a skill in my own child makes it 
disconcerting to realize that the most mindless, violent arcade game fare is 
available to those with only quarters to spend. The parent who can afford a 
computer can give a child a greater range of appropriate games to choose from, 
as well as the opportunity to become acquainted with the computer as a tool. 
</P>
<P>
If computer games do lead to familiarity with the computer, the 
disproportionately low number of girls who play may be a handicap. A study by 
T.W. Malone concluded that girls were deterred from playing video games by 
their violent elements.

John W. Porter has no illusions about the difficulties ahead. As the newly 
appointed superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools, he faces: 
</P>
<P>
* A high-school dropout rate of roughly 50%. 
</P>
<P>
* Kindergartens where half the entering children come from single-parent homes 
with unwed mothers. 
</P>
<P>
* Absenteeism that averages almost 20%. 
</P>
<P>
* Academic achievement well below the national average. 
</P>
<P>
* A $160-million budget deficit, accumulated over the past 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
* A state-mandated cut of $50.7 million in this year's $800-million budget, 
which, if carried out, would eliminate all interscholastic athletics and 
instrumental music, trim 455 custodial positions and a number of bus routes, 
and shorten the high-school day by one hour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worse Than I Thought' 
</P>
<P>
"The youngsters just are not coming through the schools able to compete in the 
21st Century," Porter says, acknowledging that "it's worse than I really 
thought it was." 
</P>
<P>
His friend and fellow educator Alonzo A. Crim, the highly regarded former 
superintendent of the Atlanta Public Schools, describes the Detroit system as 
second only to Chicago's in the enormity of the problems it faces. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that's pretty accurate," agrees Porter with something like a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Then why, in the weeks since Porter's July 1 appointment, are Detroiters 
beginning to sense a slightly upbeat tone in discussions about the schools? 
</P>
<P>
The first reason seems to be Porter himself. By all accounts, he comes to the 
job well equipped: 10 years as state superintendent for public instruction in 
Michigan (the first black in the nation to hold such a post), followed by 10 
years as president of Eastern Michigan University, which he left last January 
to take up a position as vice president of the National Board for Professional 
Teaching Standards. A trustee of the Charles Stuart Mott Foundation, he also 
chaired the select panel appointed by Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard to 
assess the financial and educational situation of the Detroit schools last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very creative, he's a person of integrity, and he's concerned about 
people and education," says Russell Mawby, chairman of the board and chief 
executive officer of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation in Battle Creek, Mich. Mawby 
gives Porter high marks for his "very effective" work as state superintendent 
and for "an absolutely superb job" as president of the once-struggling Eastern 
Michigan University. 
</P>
<P>
"He has hit the ground running," says James W. Vollman, executive director of 
the Detroit Compact. "He's in a high-risk venture, but I think his odds are 
pretty good, partly because he has caught the pulse of a number of key 
community groups, and he is setting standards that they have come to believe 
are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Drum Major' 
</P>
<P>
"He's a leader through demonstration," says Crim. "Not only does he care about 
kids, but he's willing to give of himself as the drum major in the overall 
community in gaining the support and involvement of other people." 
</P>
<P>
The second reason may be a groundswell of community support -- including a 
turnaround by the Chamber of Commerce, which has come out in favor of a Sept. 
12 ballot question seeking a tax increase to help fund the school system. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, too, a campaign to restore athletics to the schools, spearheaded 
by former Detroit Piston basketball star Dave Bing, raised $600,000 in private 
funds -- enough to keep the athletic program afloat through the fall. A similar 
program is under way to restore instrumental music. 
</P>
<P>
Even the city's teachers are lining up behind what's become known as the 
"Porter Plan" -- a five-sided attack designed to improve management, tighten 
fiscal integrity, restore discipline, upgrade academics, and win community 
confidence. In July, for the first time since 1977, the teachers union 
tentatively agreed to a contract without third-party arbitration and before 
Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
There are still plenty of doubts, however. The city's 16-year-veteran mayor, 
Coleman A. Young, is reportedly among the chief skeptics. Despite Detroit's 
reputation as one of the nation's most heavily taxed cities, Young supports the 
"millage campaign" for a 6.5-mil tax increase (a mil equals a $1 tax per $1,000 
of property value). But he sees little likelihood of fundamental change. An 
editorial in the Detroit News called for no new money without "meaningful and 
lasting" reforms in the system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
19,000 Employees 
</P>
<P>
On that point, Porter agrees. "There is a perception, and it's reflected in 
newspaper accounts, that the system is mismanaged and bloated and too big a 
bureaucracy," he said during a recent interview in his office. With 19,000 
employees, he notes, "it ranks as one of the bigger operations in the state of 
Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the weight of this bureaucracy has become its "central 
weakness," he says. "The pronouncements are centralized," he notes, "but the 
communication from this building to the field has a severance in the line -- 
it's like picking up the phone and the line's dead." 
</P>
<P>
To meet that challenge, Porter has proposed a sequential approach. His first 
task: Create management effectiveness, which he says "you've got to have before 
you can talk about fiscal integrity." 
</P>
<P>
"Second, we're going to try to create fiscal integrity because you've got to 
have fiscal integrity before you can talk about educational quality. Third, 
we're going to pursue educational quality, which is the most important goal." 
</P>
<P>
How can management be improved? Porter is calling for more "school-based 
management -- shifting accountability to the teachers and the principal, and 
clearing out the red tape and bureaucracy for them to do their job." One 
example: move all 1,600 custodians off the central office budget and put them 
on the budgets of the individual principals. 
</P>
<P>
Porter is equally strong on fiscal integrity. Earlier this year, the district 
had to borrow $42 million from the state -- which, he says, "the state had to 
get from the Japanese because American banks weren't willing to loan it to the 
Detroit schools." Porter's belt-tightening plans are designed to eliminate such 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, for educational effectiveness, Porter lists five ingredients. "You've 
got to have concerned parents. You've got to have motivated youngsters who are 
willing to come to school. You've got to have dedicated teachers who are 
willing to stay after school and to work with the individual youngsters. You've 
got to have enthusiastic support personnel, beginning with the principal. And 
you've got to have a supportive community that's willing to raise the money for 
the schools to be safe and attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"We can talk all we want to about white folks and middle-class blacks moving to 
the suburbs, and about people wanting to put their kids in private schools," 
says Porter, whose 175,000-student system is 95% black. "But it's not because 
they're racist necessarily -- it's because they know what the desirable 
conditions are for effective outcomes." 
</P>
<P>
Why, given the enormity of the task, does he want to take it on? 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something I really wanted to do," he laughs, noting that he would 
be happy simply being a retired university president. But he sees Detroit as a 
proving ground for inner-city education. "If we do not come up with some 
insightful suggestions, as far as I'm concerned the urban centers might as well 
fold up." 
</P>
<P>
Can he succeed? "Failure is not an alternative," says Mawby, "because those 
kids are there, and they've got to have a better tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he can do all of those things that he wants to do," concludes 
fellow educator Crim. "But I do feel that, like the old Western gunfighter, he 
will put a number of notches on his pistol."

COMMUNITY COALITION JUMPS INTO DETROIT SCHOOL BREACH 
</P>

These days, the once-grand avenues of inner-city Detroit are pockmarked with 
boarded-up buildings and grass-sprouting sidewalks. But new signs of hope are 
also appearing. One example: the Detroit Compact, a coalition of business, 
labor, government, higher education, the community, and the schools, modeled 
after the pioneering Boston Compact. 
</P>
<P>
Its task: to guarantee a job or further educational opportunity to every 
Detroit high school graduate who meets the standards, and to provide summer 
jobs along the way. Begun in 1988, the compact has raised $600,000 from private 
and state sources. It has recently signed up one high school and four middle 
schools and plans to operate within the entire school system within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
What's the deal? Students expecting a job must sign on to meet a set of 
criteria. Among them: reading and math skills at the 11th-grade level; at least 
a C average in a set of predetermined courses; 95% attendance in the 12th 
grade, with 97% punctuality; no felony convictions or major Student Code of 
Conduct violations; no drug use; and a set of leadership and teamwork skills, 
evidenced by letters of reference. College-bound students must have all of the 
above plus a 3.0 grade-point average and a specified score on the American 
College Test (ACT), a national college-entrance exam. 
</P>
<P>
With 6,000 to 7,000 high school students graduating each year, the commitment 
by area businesses is potentially significant -- as is the commitment by the 
state's universities, which are lining up with offers of free tuition for those 
who keep the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Why these generous inducements? 
</P>
<P>
Businesses need a skilled and responsible work force. And universities are 
competing to meet their own minimum targets for minority enrollment. The 
Detroit schools are by far the largest source of black university students in 
the state. Yet if the University of Michigan alone were to meet its 10% 
minority goal, says Detroit school Supt. John W. Porter, there would be no 
black college-bound students left to enroll in any other state university.

ART SHOW SPARKS WARM MEMORIES OF FULLERTON TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The retrospective exhibit was her idea, but in the days before the memorial 
look at her late husband's career opened, Terry Hendricks began to worry. Would 
it be depressing and maudlin, rather than the intended celebration of his life 
and work? 
</P>
<P>
Don Hendricks, a popular Orange County artist and teacher, was killed last 
February while bicycling when he was struck by a car. He was 41. "I was very 
scared about the reception," Terry Hendricks said. As it turned out, "there was 
really a festive feeling. I think it was really therapeutic for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, more than 1,000 people attended the opening reception for 
the show at the Brea Civic &amp; Cultural Center Gallery, about double the 
facility's usual opening night crowd. "He really knew a lot of people. I was 
surprised how many people he touched," Hendricks said. "It was just very sad 
that Don couldn't be there to see the show." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, which runs through Sept. 29, has sparked an avalanche of fond 
memories of Hendricks, best known for his realistic watercolors of Orange 
County scenes. He taught at Fullerton College from 1975 until his death and 
served as Brea's artist in residence from 1981 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a following. Don was everybody's best friend," said Emily Keller, 
Brea's cultural arts manager. "That opening (brought out) 1,000 of his best 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the most generous and giving human beings I have ever met," said 
Norman Lloyd, curator of Fullerton's Muckenthaler Cultural Center, site of a 
1985 retrospective of Hendricks' work. "He was a second father to many people. 
He was a mentor, one of those people that everybody looked up to." 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, Keller and Lloyd shared one of Hendricks' drawing classes while 
they were students at Fullerton College. Keller's parents had successfully 
talked her out of a career in art, or so they thought, when she took the class. 
"I was all ready to take Don's class and drop out of art," Keller recalled. "Lo 
and behold, this guy captivated not only me, but every student in there." 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go roller-skating into his class and he would put up with it," Lloyd 
said. "That's the kind of guy he was." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks was born in San Diego, but his family moved to Orange County two 
years later. He grew up in Silverado Canyon, a rural landscape that was to 
appear often in his paintings, and in high school he surfed almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
After a stint in the Army, he studied drawing and painting at Cal State 
Fullerton. Before completing his master's degree, he scored a one-man show in 
New York's prestigious O.K. Harris Gallery featuring his photo-realist graphite 
drawings of such pop-culture icons as '50s cars, racing trophies and bouffant 
hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lloyd, the show was a success and the gallery expressed interest 
in representing Hendricks, but the artist lost interest in the graphite work 
and went on to colored pencils and finally to watercolors, the medium that came 
to dominate his work. He listed Edward Hopper and Winslow Homer as two of his 
major influences. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave up a very promising public career to follow his own heart," Lloyd 
said. "He wasn't one to allow trend or fame to direct his energies." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks' paintings of Orange County subjects -- red-tile roofs, orange trees, 
scrub-covered hills -- won him a loyal local following. In the mid-'80s, he 
turned to Disneyland as the quintessential Orange County subject with a series 
of still-life paintings of Disney souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
The allegorical works cast Mickey Mouse as a Christ figure. In "Martyred Mouse 
and Seer," Hendricks once explained, "the X-acto (knife) represents death; the 
cartoon figure (a Mickey Mouse back scratcher) represents the crucified Christ; 
the eraser wipes out the sins, and Donald Duck is the people walking away." 
</P>
<P>
"As a kid in Orange County, Disneyland had a special impact on him, and he 
wanted to play with that," said Robert Miller, a longtime friend of Hendricks' 
and one of his fellow art instructors at Fullerton College. "It was just fun 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks, an avid hiker and rock-climber, concentrated on landscapes in the 
final years of his life, working in watercolor and in other media. Seldom are 
the vistas pristine -- roads and other man-made structures always intrude on 
the view, which Lloyd said reflected Hendricks' concern with increasing 
development of the county's natural areas. Later works included intimate 
studies of objects in decay, especially animal carcasses and skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly though, Hendricks' works are a reflection of Orange County's "good 
life," as he often said himself. The works were exhibited widely in local 
galleries and museums. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to paint the world he lived in," Miller said. "Orange County was an 
affluent society, and a fun one." Hendricks was a fan of Japanese Ukiyo-e 
prints, populist works that showed everyday scenes, and Miller said he felt a 
"kindred spirit" with the artists. "I think Don wanted to make beautiful 
pictures for the average person," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"People often criticize my art for being too nice and not having enough angst," 
Hendricks said in a 1983 interview with The Times. "But my work mirrors my 
world. I feel good and have always done well by the people in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks first approached teaching as a way to feed his growing family -- he 
had four children -- but according to those who knew him, it soon became 
apparent he was a natural. He taught part time at several schools before 
landing the full-time position at Fullerton College in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Keller approached him about becoming Brea's artist-in-residence 
program, a program funded by a matching grant from the California Arts Council. 
Hendricks, who took a year's sabbatical from his teaching position, received a 
salary and a studio in the city's civic center; in return, he led workshops at 
local grade schools as well as adult lectures and workshops. He also created a 
series of instructional videotapes, designed a poster for the city and curated 
a watercolor exhibit. The program eventually was funded for an additional two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Both painting and being around people came very naturally," said Kathie 
Conrey, an administrative assistant with Brea Community Services. "It wasn't 
just the quantity of programs, it was the quality. . . . He was certainly a 
high-energy person." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks kept an open studio, where people could stop by to show their work or 
talk about art. Schoolchildren would stop by after school and "drag their mom 
along," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had amazing facility, technically," Miller said. "To watch him create an 
effect was almost like watching a magician. He was able to do this while 
talking and entertaining -- that's one of the reasons he was so good as an 
artist in residence." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hendricks, the artist's wife of 21 years, finally took one of his classes 
a few years ago after hearing for years about his teaching abilities. "I found 
out it was really true," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She approached the city in spring about mounting a memorial show of her late 
husband's work, and Conrey guided the request through the city bureaucracy. 
"They were just really enthusiastic about it right from the start," Hendricks 
said, and the city rearranged its exhibit schedule to fit the Hendricks show. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and others say this is not the final chapter in the Hendricks story, 
however. "I project that Don's influence, particularly in North Orange County, 
will be long-lasting," Miller said. In 10 years, he said, "his influence as a 
teacher and an artist will be even stronger than it is now." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Celebration: Don Hendricks Memorial Retrospective" is on display through 
Sept. 29 at the Brea Civic &amp; Cultural Center Gallery, 1 Civic Center Drive 
in Brea. Hours are noon to 5 p.m. Wednesday, Friday and Saturday; noon to 8 
p.m. Thursday. Admission is free. Information: (714) 990-7730.

JOSEPH N. BELL: THE WAR AGAINST SIN OFFERS VARIETY OF ENEMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a blinding flash of light the other day -- reading about the Rev. Lou 
Sheldon of Anaheim leading his troops in protest of the Gay Pride Festival in 
Santa Ana -- I realized that the Rev. Sheldon and I are soul brothers. We're 
both against sin. Both dedicated to wiping it out, wherever we find it. Only 
thing is, we disagree a lot on what constitutes sin. And also on what to do 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, one sin on which we agree. Both of us would like to rid the 
world of unwanted pregnancies. I'd like to do it with a thorough, professional 
and objective program of sex education that recognizes human urges and 
frailties and deals with them in an atmosphere of ethical and moral behavior. 
The Rev. Sheldon would like to deal with unwanted pregnancies through 
abstinence -- which is rather like dealing with indigestion through starvation. 
Or a headache by decapitation. 
</P>
<P>
(It might be instructive to point out that the Rev. Sheldon's hometown of 
Anaheim once had the finest sex education program in the nation. It was torn 
down by people who shared the Rev. Sheldon's current views -- and today Anaheim 
has the second highest ratio of teen pregnancies in Orange County.) 
</P>
<P>
Now whenever anyone goes out into the field to fight sin -- and this is just as 
true for me as it is for the Rev. Sheldon -- we come up against one basic 
question: What is sin? The obvious authority, for many, is the Bible. But the 
problem is that just about anything you consider sinful can be validated there. 
Including hypocrisy, which Jesus came down on pretty hard. (The Rev. Sheldon 
was quoted at the gay-pride protest as saying: "We believe all men are created 
equal. A homosexual can get a driver's license." And his followers insisted 
that their love for gays was behind the protest.) So what we sin fighters are 
left with is defining sin by our own personal lights. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Sheldon hasn't expressed himself on some of the sins I worry about a 
lot, for example: confiscating the property of homeless people, failing to 
provide proper medical care for many millions of citizens in the richest 
country on earth, spending $335,000 of public money to spiff up a ranch in 
Orange County to entertain President Bush in what turned into a private 
Republican bash. But no matter; there is plenty of sin to go around. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Rev. Sheldon -- who cites his conversion to Christianity at 
the age of 16 as his license for "holding the line against sin" -- sees sin in 
striptease dancers. He cut his sin-fighting teeth closing down a carnival 
girlie show in South Dakota some years ago. If I had been living in that town, 
I would have been pretty upset because I got my early sex education (we didn't 
have it in school then either) from carnival shows. (The mind boggles to 
consider the Rev. Sheldon's wrath when "Oh, Calcutta" plays in Anaheim in 
February.) 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Sheldon is also against abortion (while opposing sex education that 
would reduce the need for abortion) and pornography. And there we're in trouble 
again. He finds pornography in sex; I find it in violence. He finds the theory 
of evolution sinful; I find efforts to indoctrinate public education with 
narrow religious views sinful. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rev. Sheldon's major thrust these days is, of course, against what he 
defines as the sin of homosexuality. He would apply the abstinence theory to 
homosexuals, sending them off to colonies where they might be re-programmed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Rev. Sheldon's world, homosexuals would come home cured and ready to 
take their place in the sinless society he envisions. It isn't clear which 
group of sinners he would colonize next: perhaps striptease dancers or 
irreverent journalists. Or ministers who preach love instead of hatred. 
</P>
<P>
So what kind of a world would it be if either the Rev. Sheldon or I were able 
to expurgate the sin we are dedicated to fighting? 
</P>
<P>
In the Rev. Sheldon's world, there wouldn't be much fun because we would all be 
exactly alike, shaped irrevocably in his mold. I'm reminded of a Bill Mauldin 
cartoon I have over my desk. It shows a young family standing outside the 
barred door of a heavy stone building. A sign over the door says "Police 
State," and the young mother is saying, "My it looks peaceful and safe in 
there." The Rev. Sheldon would create a philosophical police state in which 
none of us would have to think any more. 
</P>
<P>
In my world, by contrast, there would be plenty of fun, but also a great deal 
of confusion because of a wide variety of people doing a wide variety of things 
and not always pleasing one another. We would have to think for ourselves, and 
some of our decisions might be painful and full of doubt. They also might be 
exciting and exhilarating. Peace and safety would always be goals, but they 
would not be had at the price of authoritarianism. 
</P>
<P>
If you choose to weigh the merits of these worlds, don't kid yourself that 
either the Rev. Sheldon or I have a direct pipeline to God -- any more than you 
do. If you follow the advice of either of us without thinking it through for 
yourself, you are guilty of the only really unpardonable sin in my book.

Echoes of more than 70 different exotic phrases have resounded throughout the 
halls of the College Park Elementary School, thanks to its English-assimilation 
instruction programs. The school is one of two elementary schools in Irvine 
offering ESL (English as a Second Language) courses to students. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the influx of immigrants into Southern California, the need for 
bilingual and ESL learning became a must at the school five years ago. At the 
College Park school, on Chaparral Avenue, there are two ESL magnet classes -- 
one class for grades one through three and the other for grades four through 
six. 
</P>
<P>
The ESL magnet program involves teaching children, in English, who have very 
little or no interpretation or comprehension of the language. Most of the 
instruction is done through visual aids and constant repetition. This concept 
is sometimes tagged "motherly." The one-semester (nine months) program is 
"orally intensive," says Maureen Terry, who taught an ESL class for two years 
at College Park and is now reinitiating an interactive video class for the 
Irvine Unified School District. "Children are like sponges -- you'd be 
surprised how quickly they absorb everything. As long as you make their 
environment comfortable, the atmosphere relaxed and use the hands-on approach, 
they'll be eager to learn." 
</P>
<P>
When students use their native language, educators give them an example in 
English rather than scolding them. Teachers have found this technique 
encourages the children to use English while respecting their native tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Allard was among the first to teach and assist in instituting this 
program five years ago at the College Park school. 
</P>
<P>
"I love teaching children," she said. "I couldn't do it if I didn't. They bring 
me great joy. This summer to get a better understanding of the culture of the 
majority of my students, I went to Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Allard has 27 children in her class -- 15 are Japanese, three are Taiwanese, 
three are Latino, two are Italian, one is Costa Rican, one is Lebanese, one is 
Vietnamese and one is Norwegian. 
</P>
<P>
The College Park/Colony and its environs does include other properties along 
with its unusual and highly-acclaimed school. The Colony area is northeast of 
Walnut Avenue and was built in three phases 16 years ago, The Colony, Colony I 
and Colony II. Four different styles of homes are situated on streets given 
such names as Hemingway, Steinbeck and Wyeth. For the Colony residents' 
convenience, there is the Walnut Village Center (a mini-shopping center) at 
Culver Drive and Walnut Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest of Walnut Avenue is the College Park residential tract. But don't 
expect to find street signs with college names; they don't exist. Instead, they 
have been given names of trees. 
</P>
<P>
About a mile away, both sides of Jamboree Boulevard are lined with acres of 
vacant space, with the exception of a few trucks, pieces of equipment and a 
pile of rocks being stored there. The Irvine Co., which owns the land, has no 
development plans at present. 
</P>
<P>
For the entire community's pleasure, a 20.4-acre park -- Harvard Community 
Athletic Park -- has been on Harvard Avenue for 12 years now. It is a 
multipurpose facility with a snack bar, lighted softball, baseball and soccer 
fields, and a community building where meetings and other neighborhood 
functions are held.

JAPANESE THEATER USES SUBTLE MOVEMENTS, POETIC IMAGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yasko Gamo carefully took the mask of a female demon out of the rosewood china 
cabinet in her Corona del Mar home and gently set it on the dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
The horned mask, symbolizing female jealousy, is a replica of one used by 
actors in the Noh theater -- the highly abstract and refined Japanese theater 
that uses rich poetic imagery and highly stylized movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these (items) were given to me by my late father," Gamo said as a 
glass wind chime tinkled softly outside. "Not so many common Japanese go to 
theater to see Noh play, but because of my surroundings I have chance to see." 
</P>
<P>
As a child in Japan in the 1930s, Gamo was part of a family steeped in the 
tradition of the Noh theater: Her uncle was the 17th generation of the Hosho 
family to head the Hosho Noh School in Tokyo, which is still one of the most 
prominent Noh theater companies in Japan and is now run by her cousin. Her 
father was a scholar and collector of rare books about Noh and owned a 
bookstore specializing in Noh books, masks and instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up, Gamo said, she had many opportunities to see Noh plays and observe 
the players and musicians backstage. And, until the world war intervened and 
she and other high school students were enlisted to work in arms factories, she 
even took lessons in shimai, Noh dancing. 
</P>
<P>
All of which helps explain why Gamo, who teaches Japanese at Orange Coast 
College, was invited to serve as technical and cultural adviser on a committee 
preparing for the upcoming Orange County performance by the Kita Ryu-Noh troupe 
from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-member troupe will perform takigi noh, which simply means Noh theater 
performed outdoors by firelight rather than in the traditional Noh theater. 
(Takigi means firewood, the source of light when the ancient theater art was 
originated.) 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor version of the 15th-Century theater tradition will be performed in 
Orange County one night only at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in California Scenario, the 
sculpture garden designed by Isamu Noguchi in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County performance is being presented by the consul general of 
Japan, UC Irvine and the Boston Co. (a Boston-based investment management and 
private banking firm) as part of a five-show national tour. The Orange County 
event is sponsored by a specially created consortium of Japanese and American 
individuals and businesses, in addition to the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center and South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Orange County Committee for Takigi Noh, Gamo helped write 
the Japanese version of the program for the show. 
</P>
<P>
Thumbing through a pictorial book on the Noh theater, Gamo, 61, recalled 
enjoying attending performances with her parents several times a year as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"The costumes are very gorgeous," she said, laughing when asked if the drama 
seemed boring to a child: "The Noh play is usually long -- it is quiet, slow 
movement so, as a child, sometimes bored. Not all of them are quiet, some part 
is pretty wild -- dramatic -- but the basic movement is slow." 
</P>
<P>
Gamo thinks the Orange County audience will enjoy the performance by the Kita 
Ryu-Noh troupe, although she acknowledges that people who are unfamiliar with 
the Noh theater may think "it's boring because they're not used to seeing such 
slow, quiet movement. They (the actors) show deep feeling, (and) the stage is 
very plain, so it's quite different from Western drama." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to discussing the traditions of the Noh theater, Gamo defers to 
an expert -- UC Irvine Prof. Robert Garfias, an ethnomusicologist in the 
anthropology department. Gamo recommended Garfias to provide background on the 
troupe and the art form in a free lecture at 7:30 p.m. Monday at the Westin 
South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The Noh is extremely refined theater," Garfias said in a separate interview. 
"The Japanese feel that you have to have a lot of knowledge in order to 
appreciate it -- knowledge of the history of the period and the language of the 
poetry. The Noh drama developed in a period of great social upheaval and civil 
war in Japan, and it was designed to serve both as kind of a guide and solace 
to the population." 
</P>
<P>
Audiences, Garfias said, have to be prepared to see it. Otherwise, he said, 
"you won't know what's going on so you're apt to miss a lot. There are no 
large, overt movements -- no great traumatic climaxes. It's an art of great 
subtlety. The motion is very, very slow, and there seems to be not a lot of 
stage action, but a real connoisseur can watch one of these masked actors 
walking across the stage and tell a lot about his character." 
</P>
<P>
"In the opinion of many Japanese," Garfias added, "the Noh theater really 
epitomizes the refinement of Japanese culture." 
</P>
<P>
Gamo's own link with Japanese culture was broken in 1958, when she and her 
physicist husband, Hideya Gamo, moved to the United States. Hideya Gamo, who is 
now a professor of engineering at UCI, was hired as a research scientist at the 
IBM research center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was her link to Japanese culture broken by the move, Gamo said, but 
she was busy "concentrating to adapt myself to life here, and my husband's work 
is completely remote to traditional (Japanese) culture." 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, Gamo's husband began teaching at the University of Rochester. It was 
while serving as a member of the International Friendship Committee of the 
Rochester YWCA, Gamo said, that her interest in the traditions of her Japanese 
heritage was reawakened. 
</P>
<P>
She was frequently asked to speak on Japanese culture at schools, churches and 
local organizations and so, she said, she began to study traditional Japanese 
culture. And, when her cousin's Hosho Noh Company toured the United States, she 
said, she made the arrangements for the company's sold-out performance at the 
University of Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving to Corona del Mar in 1968, Gamo has come to be thought of as "a 
real pillar of the Japanese community in Orange County," Garfias says. 
</P>
<P>
After "four long years of juggling my studying with being a full-time housewife 
and mother," Gamo earned a bachelor's degree in social ecology at UCI and, in 
1982, began teaching Japanese at Orange Coast College. That same year she 
contributed to Cal State Fullerton's Orange County Japanese-American Oral 
History Project by interviewing two of the county's Japanese pioneers. The 
interviews, which she translated, were published by the Oral History Project of 
Cal State Fullerton in 1986. She also helped translate her cousin Homma 
Fusataka's lectures when he visited California to perform in Noh demonstrations 
at Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, UCI and Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Gamo and her husband have collected Noh theater items, which 
decorate their home: masks, drums, hand-painted fans, a large Noh screen, 
paintings, woodblock prints and videotapes of Noh performances. Some of the 
artifacts were given to Gamo by her late father; others were purchased on the 
couple's annual visits to Japan, where, Gamo said with a smile, "I feel somehow 
I'm foreign to them because I'm Americanized already." 
</P>
<P>
After living in the United States 31 years, however, Gamo nevertheless 
acknowledges, "I still feel Japanese." With another smile, she added: "My 
children are more American than Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
The Gamos' eldest daughter, Yuriko, who was 17 months old when the family 
arrived in the United States, is an art director in New York City. Their 
younger daughter, Kay, is a medical student at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In her continued effort to maintain ties with her Japanese heritage, Gamo and 
her husband occasionally attend professional tea ceremonies in San Diego. They 
also frequent Japanese dance performances and flower arrangement, bonsai and 
Japanese calligraphy exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
And, naturally, the Gamos plan to attend the performance of the Kita Ryu-Noh 
troupe from Japan Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Turning the pages of her pictorial book on Noh theater, the wind chime 
providing a delicate musical background, Gamo smiled and said, "I think it's 
wonderful to have a chance to introduce such ancient Japanese culture to 
American people."

FAMILY LIFE: CHILDREN ADVISE THEIR PARENTS TO WISE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listen up! 
</P>
<P>
That might be the best advice anyone could give a parent. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to what your children have to say. They are, after all, real people with 
real emotions and real problems. 
</P>
<P>
And, sometimes, surprising wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is a bundle of letters Family Life received last week from 
members of Linda Yeoman's fifth-grade class at Cloverdale Elementary School in 
Irvine. They were responding to a question posed in this column about 
allowances and forms of punishment. 
</P>
<P>
They expanded on their views when I visited them in the classroom this week. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the class of 10-year-olds (15 of 33) said their parents spank 
them for rules infractions, while the rest receive other forms of punishment -- 
from losing privileges to being restricted to being yelled at. 
</P>
<P>
To a person, they oppose spanking, not because it hurts but because they see it 
as ineffective. They also find shouting ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
And they get confused when Mom and Dad argue in front of them over punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Their preference? About what you and I want out of our relationships, personal 
or professional: a little reason. 
</P>
<P>
Leila Attari urges parents to establish "fair rules." She would punish her 
child "by talking (the problem) over and then listen to what the child has to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Alysia Atchley endorses her parents' approach and says she would treat her 
children the same way. "I am sent to the corner with a chair. I sit there with 
nothing to do but think (about what I'm being punished for)." 
</P>
<P>
Sara Ashraf also backs her parents' approach but would add one thing: "My 
parents explain to me what I did wrong and say not to do it again." With her 
own children, she wrote, she would do the same thing, but "if they did it 
again, I would yell at them." 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Bell asks parents to understand that children know when they've done 
something wrong and that knowledge is punishment enough. She is punished by 
losing television privileges. "That does not bother me," she wrote. "What 
bothers me is my guiltiness . . . and if I were a parent, I would try to 
understand that they feel guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Johnathon Doan, 10, says he gets "spanked and yelled at at the same time," and 
while he admits it works, he would just "yell at them and then tell them what 
they should and shouldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
Nana Ito's mother should be happy to hear that she would handle her own 
children "by talking to them just like my mom to show her that I learned a lot 
from her." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Flowers likes the idea of using what he called "sycology." For example, 
"if my child stole something, I would steal something from him, then say, 'Now 
you know how it feels.' " 
</P>
<P>
Allison Friedland says children would remember wrongdoing "if they had to write 
it down and take it to their room and think about it and then talk it over with 
their parents." 
</P>
<P>
These and other children in the Cloverdale class also suggest that parents try 
to avoid jumping to conclusions, to take a more judicial approach to a problem 
by calmly weighing both the facts and their responses. 
</P>
<P>
Those with brothers and sisters all said they had been punished for things they 
had not done (although they also admitted to keeping mum while watching the 
same thing happen to their siblings). 
</P>
<P>
In essence, what they ask of their parents is to treat their children as they 
would want to be treated themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty sound advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Allowances 
</P>
<P>
Do you give your children an allowance? If so, how much do they get and on what 
is the rate based? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spare the Rod 
</P>
<P>
How do you punish your children -- by spanking them or by restricting their 
activities? Or do you have some other method? We'd like to know. 
</P>

BEVERLY HILLS STRIKE LOOMS AS SCHOOL PAY TALKS RESUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills teachers and the school district will have another go at 
mediation today under the specter of a possible teacher strike next month if 
salary and benefit increases are not negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions, over pay and benefits for the final year of a three-year 
contract, took a turn for the worse last week when teachers voted 198 to 6 to 
strike if no agreement is reached by Oct. 16. Turning up the heat further, the 
Beverly Hills Education Assn. charged this week that the district has condoned 
union-busting activity by a principal. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Unified School District and the union, which represents about 
300 teachers, have been negotiating since May. They called in a state mediator 
in August after failing to agree. 
</P>
<P>
The district has offered to raise teacher salaries 3.05% this year and to 
continue the contract another year with a 5% increase for 1990-91. Teachers are 
seeking an 11% raise this year or 20% over two years. Salary negotiations the 
last two years yielded raises of 3% each. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the district's offer an insult, union President Judy McIntire said: 
"The teachers do not want to spend the whole year playing games." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Competitive Edge' 
</P>
<P>
McIntire pointed to the salary increases won by Los Angeles teachers after 
their spring strike and said that in order to attract quality teachers, Beverly 
Hills has to "keep salaries at a competitive edge." Los Angeles teachers 
negotiated 8% raises for each of the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The starting salary for Beverly Hills teachers is $21,604, with top pay of 
$46,270 for nine years of experience plus a master's degree and training 
credits. The average salary is $42,659. 
</P>
<P>
Under their new contract, Los Angeles teachers this year start at $27,346 and 
earn a maximum of $50,123 with 20 years' experience with a doctorate. The 
average salary in Los Angeles is $42,460, according to the school district, but 
United Teachers-Los Angeles said that figure includes benefits. Without 
benefits, the average is about $38,000, the Los Angeles teachers union said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, teachers this week are expected to ratify an agreement for 
6.5% pay increases for the year, which would boost starting pay to $27,000 and 
top pay to $46,427 for 25 years of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills district's offer, which includes raising the starting salary 
27% to $27,520, would put its teachers roughly on par with their Los Angeles 
counterparts this year but generally behind in 1990-91. "We'll get further and 
further behind," said Bill Gordon, chief negotiator for the union. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gordon said, Beverly Hills teachers have to foot much of the cost 
of their health coverage, while the Los Angeles Unified School District pays 
for full medical and dental benefits for its teachers and their families. The 
union would be willing to consider pay and fringe benefits that equal Los 
Angeles teachers', McIntire said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supt. Robert French said the Los Angeles agreement has had little effect on 
the Beverly Hills district. Only one teacher has left to work in the Los 
Angeles district this year, to shorten her commute, and there has been no 
problem recruiting teachers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators will meet with the mediator for the second time today. The district 
has said an 11% raise is out of the question; the union has said it is merely a 
question of funding priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers planned to picket in front of Beverly Hills High School and at 
Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards this morning, handing out brochures called 
"Trouble in Paradise," McIntire said. 
</P>
<P>
If the session doesn't yield progress, McIntire said, the likelihood of a 
strike is very good. 
</P>
<P>
French vowed to keep the schools open if there is a strike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Come Close 
</P>
<P>
Although the Beverly Hills district has never had a strike, it has come close. 
In 1987 and 1986, last-minute negotiations staved off threatened teacher 
walkouts over pay issues and staff cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The $28.3-million budget approved last week by the Board of Education is based 
on current salaries and takes into account all revenues and expenditures, 
leaving reserves of about 5%, or $1.3 million, French said. "There's not 11% 
there (for a raise)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
French said the teachers' demands would cost the district its reserves plus an 
additional $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The county recommends that reserves be at least 3% of the budget and 
scrutinizes anything below 1%, French said. Slashing other accounts is next to 
impossible, he added, because the district has already spent much of its 
budget, and instructional programs cannot be cut without cutting teachers. 
State law requires advance notice before teachers or administrators can be laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't print money; we certainly are not going to borrow it," French said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land Tax Proposed 
</P>
<P>
He said the district is considering a land-parcel tax measure for the June 
ballot. If approved, French said, it would bring in about about $2 million to 
the district for the 1990-91 school year, but nothing for this year. "We have 
very little control over 1989-90," he said. "We can control 1990-91." 
</P>
<P>
The district's last attempt to raise revenue by levying a tax on all parcels of 
land in the city was turned down by voters in March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The union says the district has the money to spend on teachers but has made 
them a low priority. Union officials claim that French drives a 
district-provided Jaguar and got a $20,000 raise last year. If there is enough 
money for those things, Gordon said, there is enough for a decent pay hike for 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
French said he drives a 3-year-old Toyota, for which the district pays, and 
that his raise last year was $9,300, bringing his salary to $92,300. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are "out there with their tin cups," Gordon said. "If there are any 
crumbs left over, they're scraped off and given to teachers, and we're supposed 
to be grateful." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the financial expert in the school district," McIntire said. But with 
funds from the state and city, the nonprofit, fund-raising Beverly Hills 
Education Foundation, the oil wells at the high school campus, real estate and 
sales of the chic Beverly Hills High T-shirts, the district has plenty of 
resources, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A financial analyst with the California Teachers Assn. is examining the 
district's budgets for this year and previous years, McIntire said. Even so, 
said Gordon, "it's (the district's) job, not our job, to find the money." 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Carey, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles teachers union, said the 
union evaluated an independent audit of the Los Angeles district's budget and 
information from legislators about state funding to challenge that district's 
claims about what it could and could not afford and ultimately settled the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
The union's experience has been that "it's not that the money is not there; 
it's what they want to spend it on," Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shorter Hours 
</P>
<P>
French said comparisons with Los Angeles are unfair unless they also note that 
Beverly Hills teachers teach shorter hours and smaller classes. 
</P>
<P>
The average class size in Beverly Hills is 28, McIntire acknowledges. In Los 
Angeles it is about 35, according to the teachers union there. Beverly Hills 
teachers teach 1,250 to 1,350 minutes per week, whereas Los Angeles teachers 
teach 1550 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have both" Beverly Hills' working conditions and higher salaries, 
French said -- a claim the union rejects. "If our teachers taught the same 
amount of time and had the same class size (as in Los Angeles), we could offer 
much higher salaries." 
</P>
<P>
Teaching time has also been in dispute since the 1987-89 contract was ratified. 
Teachers say they agreed to a maximum of 1250 minutes a week, with 1350 under 
extraordinary circumstances. The district says the agreement was for a range of 
1250 to 1350 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charge Filed 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Beverly Hills teachers union Monday filed a charge with the 
Public Employment Relations Board accusing Hawthorne Elementary School 
Principal Ann Picker of trying to undermine the union and accusing 
administrators, including French, of backing her. 
</P>
<P>
McIntire, who teaches at Hawthorne, said the faculty complained about Picker to 
French and the school board but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Picker, who was appointed principal in July, 1988, has told teachers that the 
Beverly Hills Education Assn. does not represent them, the union said. She also 
tried to meet with teachers individually and create a faculty advisory council 
to settle grievances and discuss job conditions, functions for which the union 
has exclusive authority, said union lawyer Robert Lindquist. 
</P>
<P>
The union charges that Picker targeted the union's representative at Hawthorne, 
teacher Robert Bailey, by increasing his duties, reprimanding him and keeping a 
separate personnel file on him. The union also says Picker refused to meet with 
Bailey to discuss teachers' concerns, in violation of the union contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reign of Terror' 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who has been a union representative several times during his 14 years 
at Hawthorne, said Picker has carried out a "reign of terror." Bailey said he 
has filed a worker's compensation claim for stress caused by what he says is 
harassment and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Picker, formerly principal at Culver City Middle School, was the subject of 
teacher criticism at a school board meeting in 1986 in that city. At that time, 
teachers accused Picker of lowering morale. 
</P>
<P>
Picker refused to comment on the Beverly Hills charges and referred inquiries 
to French. The superintendent declined to discuss Picker, saying it was a 
personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
Both the union and the district, however, are hopeful about today's mediation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic that we'll have a successful meeting and can reach 
agreement," French said. 
</P>
<P>
McIntire said: "Maybe they're really going to be getting down to business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS SCHOOL DISPUTE 
</P>
<P>
Key Issue -- Money. Teachers, represented by the Beverly Hills Education Assn., 
threaten to strike, possibly as early as Oct. 16, unless the Beverly Hills 
Unified School District provides acceptable increases in pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Teacher pay and benefits are the only issues on the table now. 
The basic contract between the teachers and the district was signed in 1987 and 
runs until June, 1990, but it provides for interim negotiations on salaries and 
fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
District's Offer -- To stay competitive with other districts, the 
Administration proposes to raise the starting salary level more than 25%, to 
$27,520. For teachers making more than that, however, the pay increase for the 
1989-90 school year would average 3.05%. The district also seeks a one-year 
extension of the overall contract to 1991, with a pay increase of 5% next year. 
</P>
<P>
Union's Demand -- Citing the 8% raises won by Los Angeles teachers for this 
year and next, the Beverly Hills teachers seek an 11% raise for the current 
year or a total of 20% over two years if the contract is extended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SALARY COMPARISONS 
</P>
<P>
Until an agreement is reached, Beverly Hills will continue to be paid at last 
year's level. Here is how they stack up against teachers in the Los Angeles and 
Santa Monica-Malibu unified school districts. The figures are provided by the 
school districts:

Permits for multifamily housing units have been issued at a more subdued pace 
this year, contrasted with 1988. After six months, permits for 4,742 such units 
had been granted, 31% below the number for the comparable period last year (48% 
less than 1987 and 45% behind 1986). 
</P>
<P>
Although June's 1,185 was the highest monthly total since last September, it is 
the lowest June figure for any of the last four years. The decrease has been 
caused most notably by the comparative lack of activity in the unincorporated 
areas of the county, although several cities have also seen their numbers drop 
dramatically.

VOLUNTEER CLEANUP OF 21 COUNTY BEACHES SCHEDULED FOR SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials expect 500 to 600 people to pitch in and clean local beaches in 
California's Coastal Cleanup Day, a statewide effort sponsored by the 
California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Regional Sanitation District is coordinating the cleanup 
locally. The state has targeted 21 public beaches in Ventura County, from 
Rincon Beach south to Point Mugu and the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Ventura County volunteers picked up 17,863 pounds of garbage, nearly 
one-fourth of the total collected statewide, said Pandee Leachman, who is 
coordinating the county's cleanup effort this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that our beaches are more polluted than those in other counties, but 
that people in Ventura County really are concerned about their beaches and are 
willing to help clean them up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup is the focal point of California's monthlong "Coastweeks" 
celebration, a statewide campaign for public awareness of coastlines, beaches 
and wetlands and the environmental dangers facing them. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup will take place from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday. Those interested 
in participating can call (805) 658-4632 for information.

Flag Desecration 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 380 to 38, the House passed a bill (HR 2978) setting criminal 
penalties for "whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns or tramples upon any 
flag of the United States...." The bill outlaws physical abuse of the American 
flag but not political condemnation of it. It applies to the actual flag, not 
to representations of the national symbol. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which was sent to the Senate, is a response to the U.S. Supreme 
Court ruling last June that desecration of the flag is a form of dissent 
protected by the Constitution. Both the House and Senate also plan to vote this 
year on whether to protect the integrity of the flag by constitutional 
amendment instead of statute. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Mike Synar (D-Okla.), said he supported the statute approach because 
"the vast majority of Americans always will respect the flag and do not need a 
constitutional amendment to teach them that respect." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) said: "It is far better to undertake a 
procedure we are confident will cure the problem, a constitutional amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the Flag Protection Act of 1989.

Arts Funding Debate 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 264 to 153, the House took a procedural step against lawmakers 
wanting a sweeping reduction in federal support of art they deem offensive. 
This occurred as the House debated positions it should take in a House-Senate 
conference on an appropriations bill (HR 2788) covering the National Endowment 
for the Arts and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The vote prevented a direct House vote on whether to go along with tough Senate 
language on federal funding of art that some see as morally offensive. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) wrote the Senate measure in response to the endowment's funding 
of projects that yielded photography of homosexual acts, naked children and a 
crucifix immersed in urine. The Helms amendment sought to ban federal funding 
to promote or produce art judged to be obscene, indecent or blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to block a direct vote on the merits of the 
Senate-passed Helms amendment.

DEUKMEJIAN SIGNED JUDGES BILL IN JULY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

The Times incorrectly reported Wednesday that legislation increasing the 
insurance and retirement benefits for San Diego County judges was signed by 
Gov. George Deukmejian last week. In fact, the bill, sponsored by Sen. Larry 
Stirling (R-San Diego), was signed into law July 13 and became effective 
immediately. Deukmejian on Tuesday announced that he had appointed Stirling as 
a San Diego Municipal Court judge, a move that will become effective with 
Stirling's resignation from the state Senate. #YES#

LAKE TO BE RESTORED AT HANSEN DAM

<TEXT>
<P>
Congress has approved $780,000 to begin restoration of the long-lost lake at 
Hansen Dam in the Northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The funds, contained in the energy and water appropriations bill sent to 
President Bush, were earmarked for the lake under a federal trust fund. The 
fund was tapped last year for $200,000, which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
is using to develop a master plan for the Hansen Dam Flood Control Basin. The 
plan is expected to include lake revitalization and recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The trust fund money is accrued from fees paid by contractor Bill Blomgren, who 
signed a five-year contract with the corps in 1984 to dig out silt in flood 
control channels for sale to construction firms. He pays the government 15 
cents to 25 cents for each ton removed. 
</P>
<P>
The once-thriving recreational area has been neglected for years. A small lake 
that Blomgren excavated earlier this year was filled in with sand after the 
corps said that it was unfit for swimming and fishing and posed a community 
hazard.

A Fontana man was killed early today when his motorcycle struck an abandoned 
vehicle with its lights off in the car-pool lane of the northbound 55 Freeway 
in Orange, a California Highway Patrol officer said. 
</P>
<P>
About 12:30 a.m., Charles Edward Earl, 40, was driving a Honda motorcycle in 
the car-pool lane at 60 to 65 m.p.h. and apparently did not see the abandoned 
Audi 4000, south of Taft Avenue, CHP Officer Keith Thornhill said. 
</P>
<P>
"He struck it in the rear causing him to be ejected from the bike, landing face 
first," Thornhill said, adding that Earl died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Another motorist suffered minor injuries when his vehicle, traveling in the 
freeway's fast lane, struck the motorcycle, Thornhill said. Edward Eugene 
Wyant, 32, of San Bernardino was transported to Kaiser Foundation Hospital in 
Anaheim.

Rockwell International Corp. today sued the government, alleging that its 
contract to run the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant requires the company to 
violate federal hazardous-waste laws. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in Washington in an attempt to get a court to clarify 
Rockwell's obligations under the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said it was forced to sue because it feared that it would be charged 
with criminal offenses for its running of the plant near Denver. The plant 
makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.

Maricopa County Atty. Richard Romley said today his investigation concluded 
there was nothing improper in the pre-dawn extradition to Los Angeles of a 
Tucson man accused of murdering actress Rebecca Schaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
Robert John Bardo's court-appointed defense attorney in Tucson had asked Atty. 
Gen. Bob Corbin to investigate the Aug. 10 extradition, but Corbin forwarded 
the case to Romley. 
</P>
<P>
Bardo was whisked from the Pima County Jail in an Aug. 10 pre-dawn transfer 
that an assistant public defender later said violated his rights. She had filed 
her initial challenge to the extradition in the wrong court.

150,000 TAKE OFF AS HUGO TAKES AIM AT GA., CAROLINA;

HURRICANE'S EDGE TO HIT AT 8 P.M.

Hurricane Hugo advanced faster and with renewed fury today on Georgia and South 
Carolina as 150,000 coastal residents grabbed what they could carry and fled 
inland on jammed highways. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to take any chances," said Lamar Davis, a bartender on St. 
Simons Island off southern Georgia, who stole a last glance at the pounding 
surf before leaving with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The leading edge of Hugo, whose winds muscled up to 125 m.p.h. from 105 m.p.h. 
the day before, was most likely to hit between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston 
any time after 8 p.m., local time. A hurricane warning was in effect between 
Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m., Hugo was 220 miles from Savannah and bearing down at 20 m.p.h. It 
was expected to turn gradually to the north, according to the National Weather 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tidal Surge Feared 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a 
dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot tide that 
peaks after 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"On top of that will be waves, and so (on) . . . barrier islands (in) many 
places the buildings will be swept clean off of those islands," Bob Sheets, 
director of the National Hurricane Center, said from Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Evacuees queued up at gasoline stations and stripped store shelves of bottled 
water, bread and batteries. Officials warned coastal dwellers not to linger 
because gale force winds and flash floods could block escape routes. Five to 10 
inches of rain is expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy moved ships out of coastal harbors to ride out the storm at sea. Army 
bases in coastal states moved helicopters inland or into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
In South Carolina, which was in a state of emergency, Gov. Carroll Campbell 
dispatched 400 National Guardsmen to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal 
barrier islands and shorefront. About one-fifth of the state's 3.1 million 
residents live in eight coastal counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resort Streets Deserted 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, the wind-swept streets of the resort island of Hilton Head 
were deserted. Store windows were fortified with boards and most homes were 
empty. State troopers guarded the island's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought our photo albums and our important papers," said Pat Bross, who had 
stopped for gas while heading from Hilton Head to Augusta, Ga., with her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgia Emergency Management Agency opened shelters and advised about 
142,000 people -- more than 95,000 of them in Chatham County -- to leave their 
homes. Gov. Joe Frank Harris declared a state of emergency in six counties. 
</P>
<P>
The state's biggest shelters were opened at Georgia Southern College in 
Statesboro, with room for 15,500, and the Veterans Administration Medical 
Center in Dublin, where officials said nearly 19,000 could be housed. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal school systems canceled classes for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of 
strength, indicating that it was powerful enough to cause extensive damage.

JUDGE GIVES ESTRANGED WIFE CUSTODY OF EMBRYOS

Declaring that life begins at conception, a judge today awarded custody of 
seven frozen embryos to the woman who hopes to carry them to term, not the 
estranged husband who does not want to be a father. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge W. Dale Young ruled in favor of Mary Sue Davis over Junior Davis 
in the unprecedented divorce case, which grew out of the decade-old technology 
of "test-tube babies," or in-vitro fertilization. 
</P>
<P>
The judge declared that the embryos are not property, but children. In effect, 
he then treated the case like a typical custody dispute, in which the 
overriding concern is the best interest of the child. 
</P>
<P>
"From fertilization, the cells of a human embryo are differentiated, unique and 
specialized to the highest degree of distinction," the judge said. Thus, he 
said, "human life begins at conception." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mary Sue Davis could have temporary custody so that she could have the 
eggs implanted in her womb in hopes of becoming pregnant. Child support, 
visitation and final custody will be decided if a birth results, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The eggs were fertilized last year, before the couple's marriage broke down. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Davis said he will appeal. "They are going to force me to become a 
father against my wishes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sue Davis, who now lives in Florida, had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the toughest decision of my life as a judge," Young said in an 
interview. "On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 10. I have agonized over it. 
</P>
<P>
"The full focus of the court in the case of children is on what's to their best 
interests, not what mom wants, not what dad wants and not what the grandparents 
want." 
</P>
<P>
Young's ruling relied on a 1988 federal appeals court decision from Florida 
affirming the reliability of DNA profiling in determining a person's 
individuality -- "that the life codes for each special, unique individual are 
resident at conception and animate the new person very soon after fertilization 
occurs." 
</P>
<P>
The Davises became embroiled in the dispute after they were unable to have 
children and turned to in-vitro fertilization. 
</P>
<P>
The couple produced nine embryos in December under the guidance of Dr. I. Ray 
King at a Knoxville clinic. Two were implanted in Mary Sue Davis but failed to 
develop. The others were put in cold storage. Junior Davis sued for divorce in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
During three days of testimony in August, he said he would feel "raped of my 
reproductive rights" if his wife were allowed to implant the embryos without 
his consent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not asking that they be destroyed," he said. "I'm just asking that they 
not be inserted in Mary or any other donor." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sue Davis, 29, argued that the embryos represent her best chance of 
becoming a mother. She contended that her husband was seeking a right not 
normally given to a man -- whether a child should be born after he has 
fertilized the egg of his mate. 
</P>
<P>
"He consented to be a father and I'm willing to let him," Mary Sue Davis 
testified.

Norway broke Western export rules by mistakenly sending high-tech computers to 
the Soviet Union, believing it was flying supplies to a Red Cross hospital in 
Armenia, Norwegian customs officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
There were 27 packages of computer equipment involved, and 18 have already been 
returned by the Norwegian-built Red Cross hospital. The rest will follow, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The computers, which were meant to have been shipped to an American producer, 
got mixed up with the Red Cross shipment of washing powder and medicines in an 
Oslo airport storeroom. 
</P>
<P>
"The computers were sent to the Soviet Union in violation of export 
regulations," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sigrid Romundset said. "This is a 
very serious case."

Immunex Corp. today announced a plan that will transform it from a 
research-dominated firm in medical biotechnology into a conventional 
pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-year-old company, based in Seattle, said it will achieve the transition 
primarily by reacquiring rights to sell Immunex-developed products in the 
United States. In return, its business partners will get rights to some other 
Immunex products, primarily for overseas distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Immunex uses gene-splicing and other biotechnology techniques to create 
products for medical treatment.

DOW JONES HAS 66%, SEEKS ALL OF TELERATE

Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., moving to consolidate its role in electronic 
publishing, said today it will acquire the remainder of Telerate Inc., the 
financial information service already 66% owned by the Wall Street Journal 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones said it will pay $576 million, or $18 per share, for Telerate's 32 
million publicly owned shares, a substantial premium over the $15.125 at 
Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
But Wall Street traders placed bets that the publishing giant will eventually 
have to pay even more for the rest of Telerate, and lifted its stock $5 to 
$20.125. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones said it is prepared to meet with Telerate to discuss the proposal, 
which traders took as a signal that the company may be willing to enhance its 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
Telerate, founded two decades ago, was a pioneer in the booming business of 
providing real-time financial information to banks, brokers and corporations, 
using a global network of video terminals. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones, also a major player in electronic news with its computer-based Dow 
Jones News Retrieval, began building a stake in Telerate in recent years. It 
has long been expected to buy 100% of Telerate stock at some point, although 
traders were surprised at the timing. 
</P>
<P>
At present Dow Jones owns about 66.2% of Telerate common shares. Its new bid 
values all of Telerate at about $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A Telerate spokesman said Neil Hirsch, Telerate president and chief executive 
officer, had no comment on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
While Dow Jones has a controlling interest of Telerate, traders believe 
Telerate may need to compel a higher bid from its majority owner. An arbitrager 
who requested anonymity said, "The directors have to demand what they consider 
a fair price for the minority shareholders."

OAKLAND REPORTEDLY GUARANTEES RAIDERS 5 YEARS OF SELLOUT GAMES 
</P>

<P>
The Raiders football team would be guaranteed at least five years of sold-out 
games if they agree to leave Los Angeles and return to Oakland, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The promise is included in the offer by the city and Alameda County to Raiders' 
owner Al Davis, Oakland City Manager Henry Gardner confirmed to the Oakland 
Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the offer, to be made public later today, is a plan to sell 
the Oakland Coliseum's name to a corporate sponsor, the paper said, citing an 
unnamed source close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The city and county, which jointly own the 52,000-seat stadium, have been 
negotiating to assemble a financial package to bring the NFL team back to 
Oakland, where they still have a large following. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders moved to Los Angeles after the 1981 season, but the team, whose 
lease with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum expires after 1991, is reviewing 
offers from its current home, Sacramento and the San Gabriel Valley city of 
Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of Oakland's offer previously revealed by officials include a proposed 
$54-million franchise fee and $53 million in stadium improvements, including 
the addition of 10,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the franchise fee and improvements would be paid for by the Coliseum's 
sale of tax-free revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The city and county's guarantee of sellout games calls for a $30 charge for all 
the expanded Coliseum's 52,000 seats, with an extra charge of $100 to $1,600 a 
year on the best 33,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
That would make more than half the Raiders tickets among the highest in the NFL 
-- $40 to $190 a game. The Coliseum would also build more than 100 12-seat 
luxury boxes with an annual rent of $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
Another part of the offer is a 24-year lease beginning in 1992, according to 
the unnamed source cited by The Tribune. The lease could be renegotiated after 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The offer also includes a practice field three football fields wide, a gift of 
land near the Coliseum to build a Raiders Football Hall of Fame and a pledge to 
give the team all income from souvenir sales and half the income from parking 
and food and beverage concessions. 
</P>
<P>
If the Raiders choose Oakland's bid, the agreement would need public review and 
the approval of the Oakland City Council, Alameda County supervisors and 
Oakland Coliseum officials. 
</P>
<P>
City and county officials in Sacramento last week approved a bid to lure the 
Raiders north. The offer includes $50 million in cash, the promise to build a 
new stadium near the Arco Arena and guaranteed ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city of Irwindale already has paid the Raiders a $10-million, 
non-refundable fee and reportedly will give than an additional $20 million in 
direct payments in a $195-million package. But the package, which reportedly 
includes a new stadium, has bogged down in legal and financing problems.
