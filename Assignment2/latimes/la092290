DEBATE OVER CENSORSHIP OF THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Who decides issues of censorship in the arts?" you ask (editorial, "Sister 
Mary Ignatius Isn't Happy," Sept. 13). But is censorship the only issue here? 
What of those who feel that their beliefs and values are being mocked and 
demeaned in the guise of art? In your words, "Sister Mary Ignatius" will offend 
some because of its harsh handling of Catholic beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when one thus offended takes action, you raise the charge of censorship in 
order to divert discussion away from issues of virtue and sensibility. I doubt, 
for example, that you would be so lenient if the play dealt with one of our 
ethnic or racial minority groups in a similar manner. And rightly so. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, censorship is unpleasant, and Costa Mesa seems bent upon adopting 
severe measures to address what it sees as an assault on shared values. That is 
unfortunate. But when art exists as a means to hurt others, as more and more it 
seems to do, such actions may not be so severe after all.

DEBATE OVER CENSORSHIP OF THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Krauthammer's column epitomizes the mentality of the reactionary conservative 
right. Congress, by seeking to qualify the NEA bill, does indeed censor art 
because, as a sanctioned authority, it imposes its view of what is and what is 
not art on the populace. 
</P>
<P>
Krauthammer's idea for a "Himmelfarb Amendment," which would support only "old, 
established art," can only be seen as the most dangerous of reactions to the 
avant-garde. He, like the right, chooses to live in a past that is safely 
understood and offers no surprises or discomforts; yet he seems to forget that 
aesthetic opinions of Rachmaninoff, Beethoven and similar artists have been 
forged in part by the benefit of years of hindsight. These artists' works 
inspire because they dared to do something radically different in mediums which 
threatened to stagnate.

Your story, "U.S. Firms to Ship Soviets Billions of Cigarettes" (Sept. 14), 
prompted the following calculation: The 34 billion cigarettes that U.S. tobacco 
firms sell to the Soviet Union will cause the premature deaths of about 70,000 
Russians. Perhaps President Bush will approach tobacco industry leaders and ask 
them to supply the Iraqi army with their wares as well.

CALIFORNIA THEATER

Your article (Sept. 5) on the demolition of the California Theater quotes me as 
saying, "It should come down." 
</P>
<P>
I did not say that and did not imply that. For two years my organization, the 
Los Angeles Conservancy, has led the fight to prevent the demolition of that 
theater. We stopped the demolition in the autumn of 1988. We worked for more 
than a year in seeking tenants for the building. Though we lost this particular 
fight, we remain unalterably opposed to the destruction of historic buildings 
of such significance, and would never advocate the demolition of the California 
Theater.

YOUTH HOSTEL IN VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's letter (July 30) regarding youth hostels was 
misinformed. Her letter responded to the article which featured the Share-Tel 
International Hostel on Brooks Avenue in Venice Beach ("L.A. On a Shoestring," 
Metro, June 26). 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Share-Tel was determined by the Los Angeles Department of Building and 
Safety to be in full compliance with the city's building codes and zoning laws. 
Despite this, Galanter has been using her office to harass Share-Tel by filing 
complaints with several city agencies. For example, in 1989, a complaint was 
filed with the Rent Control Board. The board determined that Share-Tel was not 
in violation. Recently, the city's tax and permit division audited Share-Tel's 
transient occupancy tax payments. Under state laws and city ordinances, 
transient occupancy taxes are payable only for tenants who stay for 30 days or 
less. The auditors nevertheless determined that Share-Tel owed back tax 
payments for the long-term tenants who stayed more than 30 days. An appeal is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Youth hostels are not prohibited in the RD1.5 zone. They are not even mentioned 
in the zoning ordinance. Nevertheless, the Board of Zoning Appeals, a political 
body appointed by the City Council, decided that Share-Tel is operating a 
"hotel business." Share-Tel does not, however, fall under the definition of 
"hotel" in the zoning ordinance. It should be noted that the building was 
constructed in 1908 when Venice was an independent city, and that as far back 
as 1927 the building was used for weekly rentals by people coming to enjoy the 
beach. Share-Tel is an apartment building. It has not been converted or 
altered.

<P>
The U.S. Congress is asking Japan and Germany to shoulder some costs for the 
Persian Gulf military intervention. They are not being turned into "scapegoats" 
as your editorial suggests ("Why Scapegoat Germany, Japan?" Sept. 13). 
</P>
<P>
Rather, these two countries, which have a great need for imported oil and have 
the financial resources to assist in the military buildup, appear to be failing 
in their duty to resist the action taken by Iraq. If the military might of the 
U.S. were not present now in Saudia Arabia, it is likely that Iraq's invasion 
of the oil-rich countries in the gulf would be more extensive than it is. Also, 
future threats from Iraq may well have to be addressed. If not, now, when? If 
not by the international community, then by whom?

NATIONALISTIC DREAMS OF UNITY IN MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. Augustus Richard Norton aptly summarizes the nationalist modern Arab 
dreams of Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Hafez Assad of Syria, Ayatollah Khomeini 
of Iran and Saddam Hussein of Iraq ("Grand Delusions," Opinion, Sept. 16). 
Their dreams are quite similar and characterized by each striving to be the 
leader of the new aggressive empire, and each has the destruction of Israel as 
the central goal. 
</P>
<P>
Since Hussein considers both East and West Palestine as an integral part of 
"the Arab nation" centered in Baghdad, and since the Palestinians, including 
the PLO, support his plans, it follows that the latest demand for a new 
Palestinian state is specious. Such a demand is designed as a temporary state, 
to weaken Israel sufficiently to make it possible to eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
One might ask, why should we care if the demand for another Palestinian state 
is specious, if peace is promised in return for territory? The speciousness of 
the demand for a Palestinian state concerns us because, contrary to promises, 
it would not produce peace, but more wars. Weren't the borders of Lebanon, 
Kuwait and Iran clearly recognized before being overtaken by Syria, and Iraq 
respectively? Now that we clearly know that the demand for another Palestinian 
state is a shameful sham, we can devote our time and effort to produce real 
peace, by settling the Arab refugees in Arab lands, and motivating the 
countries in the Middle East to stay independent on a live-and-let-live basis.

It is a sad day when one opens the Opinion section and reads a supposedly 
scholarly article that lacks any historical or political reality, presented as 
the leading article. I refer to "Grand Delusions." 
</P>
<P>
It endeavors to represent that the Arabs have been pursuing an unfulfilled 
dream to unite the Arab nations, which share a common history and language. 
Four "Arab" leaders (among them Khomeini who was an Iranian and thus a 
non-Arab) are introduced. The four pursued the dream of uniting "Arab" nations, 
including Iran, a non-Arab nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has accomplished in a single day what 2,500 years of history has 
failed to do, i.e., the destruction of Iranians' separate and distinct 
identity, history and language.

In response to your editorial "Why Scapegoat Germany, Japan?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I have to repeat this question. 
</P>
<P>
Did President Bush ask the agreement of the European countries and Japan for 
his military dispositions in the gulf region? No, he didn't. He also didn't ask 
the American people. 
</P>
<P>
And the bill should naturally be paid by others. Especially Germany and Japan. 
We didn't order this military demonstration of power. Without it, there 
wouldn't be so many hostages. And it would have been better to do what Henry 
Kissinger said years ago: Let them kill each other.

This is regarding your editorial ("Don't Underrate Tehran's Cynicism," Sept. 
14) in which you assume that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is 
permissible in Islamic society. I want to point out that your assumption is 
absolutely wrong because this game is strictly an invention of secular society 
aimed at dividing the people, thereby producing different constituencies for 
the purpose of exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Although everyone, including President Bush, seems to be perplexed by the 
current Middle East crisis, there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that it 
is this secular game which is primarily responsible for our dilemma. One would 
hope it is still not too late to learn a lasting lesson from this unfortunate 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, in an Islamic society, friend of a friend is considered a friend.

As one who did not believe the Raiders would stay in Los Angeles, I must say

is obvious that Al Davis wanted to stay here, on his terms, and Al obviously

<P>
Nolan Henke sank five consecutive birdies on the way to a seven-under-par 64 in 
the second round of the B.C. Open Friday at Endicott, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Henke, who was tied with Jim Hallet at 66 after the first round, leads Hallet 
by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Henke's total of 12-under-par 130 matches the PGA's best 36-hole score of the 
season -- by Jose Maria Olazabal at the World Series of Golf and by Peter 
Persons at Chattanooga a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Hallet, yet to finish better than fifth in a tournament in three years on the 
tour, said he could have done more with his round Friday. "I could have gotten 
to 14- or 15-under. I had a lot of birdie putts skim the edge of the cup," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Tewell shot a 64 and was at 135, five strokes behind Henke. Robert Wrenn 
was at 136 after a 68 and five were at 137. 
</P>
<P>
Chip Beck survived Nick Faldo's runaway start and beat the defending champion, 
2 and 1, to reach the semifinals of the World Match Play golf championship at 
Wentworth in Virginia Water, England. 
</P>
<P>
Beck led by as many as five holes at point after Faldo, the Masters and British 
Open champion from Britain, won the first two of 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open champion Hale Irwin lost, 6 and 4, to Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe, and 
Welshman Ian Woosnam beat Northern Ireland's Ronan Rafferty, 5 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman of Australia beat countryman Wayne Grady with a birdie on the 
second playoff hole to gain a semifinal berth against McNulty. Beck will play 
Woosnam. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Fleisher and Phillip Hancock started the day with a 7 and 6 victory, 
sparking the United States to a 6 1/2-1 1/2 lead over Europe after the first 
day of the 1990 PGA Cup Matches at Turtle Point Golf Club in Kiawah Island, 
S.C.

John Walsh tied a school record by passing for four touchdowns and leading 
Carson High to a 37-14 victory over Lynwood Friday night in an intersectional 
game at Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts' victory was the 300th for Coach Gene Vollnogle, who will retire 
after the season. 
</P>
<P>
The winningest coach in California history, Vollnogle has won 279 games at the 
varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
Carson improved to 2-0 and Lynwood dropped to 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh struggled in the first half, completing four of 10 with two 
interceptions. But on the first drive of the second half, he passed to running 
back Abdul Muhammad on a 55-yard touchdown scoring play to give Carson a 17-0 
lead. It was the first of Muhammad's three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh finished with 12 completions in 22 attempts for 337 yards. Among Carson's 
defensive standouts were back Tarriel Hopper (two fumble recoveries) and 
lineman Art Malupe (two sacks). 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the top-rated team in the City, took a 24-0 lead late in the third 
quarter when Muhammad caught a 14-yard touchdown pass. Colt running back Darryl 
Gideon had a 47-yard run to set up Muhammad's second touchdown. DAVID RAATZ

Wally Masur rallied to defeat Martin Jaite in a five-set struggle Friday at 
Sydney, Australia, to give Australia to a 2-0 lead over Argentina in their 
Davis Cup semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Masur defeated Jaite, 3-6, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, 6-0, 6-2, in just under three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Jaite looked in command after winning the first two sets, but Masur gained in 
confidence as the match progressed and his serve-volley game came together. He 
dropped only seven points in the fourth set and reeled off four games in a row 
to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday (Thursday night in the United States), Pat Cash gave Australia a 
1-0 lead with a 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Alberto Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
If Australia wins, it will play the winner of the U.S.-Austria semifinal Nov. 
30-Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Conchita Martinez of Spain defeated fifth-seeded Rachel McQuillan of Australia, 
6-4, 6-3, to reach the semifinals of the $150,000 Paris Open women's 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, the No. 10 player in the world and top-seeded in this tournament, 
will meet fourth-seeded Julie Halard of France, who defeated Debbie Graham, 6-7 
(7-2), 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Sandra Cecchini of Italy eliminated Regina Rejchrtova of 
Czechoslovakia, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, and will play Patricia Tarabini of Argentina, 
who beat Petra Langrova of Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 6-3.

Silver Ending made his move on the final turn, took the lead in midstretch and 
scored a two-length victory over another Southland-based colt, Music 
Prospector, in the $300,000 Pegasus Handicap for 3-year-olds at the Meadowlands 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended a four-race losing streak for Silver Ending, who finished 
fifth in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
He covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 1/5 in winning for the third time in eight 
starts this year and for the fifth time in 13 outings. 
</P>
<P>
The time was three-fifths of a second off the stakes and track record set by 
World Appeal in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, Silver Ending paid $6.40, $4.40 and $3.40 and 
earned $180,000 for owners Deborah McAnally and Angelo Costanza. The colt has 
earned $914,400. 
</P>
<P>
Longshot Senator To Be led the field through the first three quarters of a mile 
in 1:09 3/5. As the leaders entered the stretch, Senator To Be was a length in 
front of Runaway Stream with Silver Ending, who had been in fifth on the 
backstretch, closing with a rush on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending carried top weight of 119 pounds, three more than Music 
Prospector and eight more than Runaway Stream. Music Prospector paid $13 and 
$7.80; Runaway Stream returned $7.40. 
</P>
<P>
Potentiality broke a close fifth out of the gate, then took the lead after the 
first quarter en route to a 1 1/2-length victory in Friday's $100,000 Island 
Whirl Handicap at Louisiana Downs in Bossier City. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old colt, ridden by Earlie Fires, covered the seven furlongs in a 
near-record 1:22.2 and paid $22.40, $5.80 and $3.80. Favored Black Tie Affair 
paid $2.60 and $2.40 and Ankles returned $3.60.

PEDROZA HAS 'LASS LAUGH IN FEATURE

Jockey Martin Pedroza ruined Laffit Pincay's 1990 Fairplex Park debut Friday, 
charging from behind on Shinko's Lass to a 2 3/4-length victory in the $53,900 
CTBA Marian Stakes at 1 1/6 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Circling three wide around the far turn, Pedroza guided Shinko's Lass past 
Something Comfy, the troubled favorite with Pincay aboard. Intercivet was 
another five lengths behind in third in the field of 10 three-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
Shinko's Lass covered the distance in 1:43 2/5 and paid $17.40. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the second in a row for Shinko's Lass, who won $31,400. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most important win for this filly to date," said trainer Mike 
Mitchell of the Desert Wine filly who had previously won two of 13 starts. 
"With so much black type in her breeding, we needed to make her a stakes 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
Dropping well off Timely Walk's fast early fractions, Shinko's Lass appeared a 
certain winner when Pedroza swung her outside down the backstretch. Something 
Comfy, the 9-5 choice, never had clear sailing until the final quarter-mile. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Black was excused from all mounts Friday and will ride only once more at 
Fairplex Park this year, in the $100,000-added Las Madrinas Handicap next 
Friday, according to steward Thomas Ward. 
</P>
<P>
"Corey felt he needed to take some time off," said Ward of the leading jockey 
at Fairplex Park the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Corey called me Friday morning and said he just isn't mentally ready to ride 
here. He'll be riding out of town the next three days." 
</P>
<P>
Through Thursday, Black had won with three of 45 mounts. 
</P>

David Flores rode three winners Friday, increasing his lead in the rider 
standings to 15-12 over runner-up Julio Garcia. . . . Four patrons tabbed six 
winners for a $12,694 payoff in the Pick Six. . . . Undefeated Stan's Lad is 
the favorite to win today's Derby Trial Stakes.

<P>
The $1-million Super Derby from Louisiana Downs will be televised here Sunday 
between the fifth and sixth races. Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled and 
Preakness victor Summer Squall head the attractive lineup that also includes 
local stars Stalwart Charger and Cee's Tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's track attendance of 9,500 represented a 500 increase over 1989. Total 
mutuel handle of $3,045,627 compares to $2,952,117 bet last year.

The Illinois Supreme Court on Friday declared seven-term state Rep. Penny 
Pullen the winner in her long-contested GOP primary race against a woman who 
challenged her anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
The state's highest court ruled that Pullen, one of the strongest abortion foes 
in the General Assembly, won the March primary by six votes over Rosemary 
Mulligan, a Des Plaines paralegal. 
</P>
<P>
A lower court had found that the two women had tied and mandated a coin toss to 
determine the winner. When Mulligan won, Pullen's forces appealed to the 
state's highest court.

PANEL FAILS TO GET TO ROOT OF ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: PLANNING COMMISSION CAN'T FIGURE HOW MANY OR WHAT KIND OF TREES 
HOME BUILDER SHOULD PLANT TO REPLACE THE 200-YEAR-OLD TREES HE CUT DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's an issue that has no precedent and no clear answer: If a developer removes 
dozens of live oak trees, two of them reportedly at least 200 years old, to 
make room for new homes, how many should he be forced to replace? And how large 
should the replacement trees be? 
</P>
<P>
That question boggled the San Diego Planning Commission on Friday for an hour 
and a half and the members finally decided to make no decision at all. 
</P>
<P>
The planning commissioners were clearly frustrated by the case, brought to them 
on appeal by various Fallbrook community groups and residents. They are angry 
that developer Richard Blakeslee removed 38 trees by his count -- and nearly 
100 by other people's count -- and otherwise scalped the 8-acre site of nearly 
all its natural landscaping so he can build 25 homes along Tecolate Drive, 
alongside the Pala Mesa golf resort. 
</P>
<P>
The tree removal was technically legal, county officials say, because a 
previous order that no more than 10 of the oak trees be removed had somehow 
mysteriously disappeared from the grading permit that he inherited when he 
bought the property in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Blakeslee has removed the trees, county officials are trying to 
decide how many new trees he should plant as replacements. 
</P>
<P>
The county staff suggested that he plant 30 live oak trees in 36-inch boxes, 30 
oaks in 24-inch boxes, and 150 one-gallon trees. Blakeslee had agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fallbrook Community Planning Group, the Fallbrook Nature Conservancy 
and several nearby residents appealed the administrative decision, saying the 
replacement trees weren't enough -- nor large enough. They want the Planning 
Commission to order more, and larger, replacement oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners by and large were sympathetic to the tree lovers. "I know how 
hard it is to grow an oak tree. They take several hundred years. I guess I've 
never actually seen one grow," reflected Toni Kastelic. She added later of 
Blakeslee's tree removal: "He either has no conscience, or he was not 
conscious." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Clarence Wilson referred to the site as a "bad scar" that 
"appalled" him. 
</P>
<P>
Added commissioner Richard Wright, "How do you determine replacement value? How 
do you put a value on a 100-year-old oak tree?" 
</P>
<P>
Wallace Tucker, president of the Fallbrook Nature Conservancy, said various 
botanical organizations have tried to do just that. A 100-year-old oak tree 
with a 24-inch-diameter trunk is worth about $69,000, he said. A tree with a 
48-inch-diameter trunk is 190 years old and worth $98,000. Two trees on the lot 
had 5-foot-diameter trunks and were 240 years old -- and are worth $76,000 
each, Tucker maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The kinds of trees that the county staff and Blakeslee had agreed to replace 
fall far short of those kinds of monetary values, Tucker argued. 
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion was that Blakeslee replace enough trees so that their total, 
cumulative trunk diameters equal those of the trees he cut down. 
</P>
<P>
Blakeslee's attorney, Stan Prowse, contended that large oak replacements have a 
high mortality rate, and that smaller trees -- with a greater chance of 
survival -- should be planted. Larger trees would die, "and none of us have a 
desire to make a bad situation worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Alan Ziegaus cautioned, however, that if the county orders 
Blakeslee to put in more and larger trees than he can afford, "the gentleman 
won't proceed with the project, and then we're stuck with no trees at all." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the commission ordered its staff to reassess various formulas for 
an appropriate solution in time for its meeting Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Blakeslee said after the meeting: "Be damned if I know where this is leading. I 
don't know what we're going to do."

San Diego police said Friday they have several suspects under surveillance in 
the slayings of five women in the Clairemont-University City area but have 
brought none in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Police also revealed that a man who admitted to the killings agreed to turn 
himself in Thursday in Balboa Park. Police waited one hour but the man never 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also have received a letter from someone claiming to be the killer 
but police have dismissed it as the work of a prankster. 
</P>
<P>
The new information came during the department's daily press briefings, which 
began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police have mounted the city's largest murder investigation to try to find a 
man they believe has killed five women since January. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sept. 13, when the last two women were found stabbed to death in 
University City, 19 investigators have been assigned full-time to the case and 
more might be added. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Capt. Dick Toneck, one of three police spokesmen assigned to the task 
force investigating the murders, said Friday that police "have a number of 
people under surveillance" but would not say on what basis, by what method, or 
for how long. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get into tactics as far as surveillance," he said. "I can tell you my 
concern and the department's concern is that this person will hit again, 
period. If he was to quit and never do it again, it would be the greatest thing 
that ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck also reluctantly confirmed a report that a man claiming to be the serial 
killer called a local television station Thursday and said he would surrender 
to police at 4 p.m. in Balboa Park. Toneck said police waited in the park until 
5 p.m. and then gave up. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, he said, someone wrote the department to accept 
responsibility for the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said police believe both claims to be the work of one person. He said 
that publicity about the letter and the promised Balboa Park rendezvous will 
only encourage others to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"My fear is that this kind of information, when it gets out, will wind up 
causing us to go out to every place in San Diego to deal with these kinds of 
people," he said. "It would cause unnecessary work for us. It's someone who 
wants to cause problems for this investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Police are swamped with 700 tips from people offering information about the 
killer, Toneck said. He said law enforcement officials are slowly working their 
way through the leads and trying to get back to tipsters but that hundreds 
remain unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
"We're inundated with calls, which is fine, we'll take them," he said. "We're 
going to try to make phone calls back to some of the leads to make people aware 
we're following them. We're asking the public to be patient with us." 
</P>
<P>
Police are looking for a black or dark-skinned man, age 14 to 23, with short 
hair, a medium build, and between 5-foot-7 and 5-foot-10. Many have claimed to 
have seen the man, who police believe has fatally stabbed four brunette women 
between the ages of 18 and 21 and one of the victim's mothers, always between 8 
a.m. and 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The killings have raised a furor in Clairemont, the site of three slayings, and 
in University City, where two have occurred. Women are so panic-stricken that 
they are keeping baseball bats under their beds, checking closets and buying 
door and window locks. 
</P>
<P>
Because some of the victims have been reported by police to have showered just 
before the killings, many women are avoiding morning or midday showers. 
</P>
<P>
Some have hidden their kitchen knives. In all but one of the cases, women have 
been stabbed with knives from inside their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"What I would like to see the public do is to try and remain calm and to try 
and feel safe in their own homes," Toneck said. "As time goes by (without 
another killing), people will feel better." 
</P>
<P>
The killings occurred in January, February, April and last week. Investigators 
said there is no way from the irregular pattern to determine when, if, or where 
the serial killer will strike again. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said Friday that the task force has decided not to send investigators to 
Gainseville, Fla., where four young women and one man have been stabbed to 
death near the University of Florida campus since August. He said the task 
force has decided that the San Diego and Florida cases are not linked.

PETITION ASKS LESS COSTLY S.D. SEWAGE TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three San Diego City Council members sent a letter Friday to the head of the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asking him to allow the city to use new 
and less costly methods of treating sewage while still meeting stringent 
federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
On another front, the Sierra Club on Friday said it will ask the judge 
overseeing a federal lawsuit seeking to require San Diego to upgrade to 
secondary sewage treatment to reject a consent decree, and instead hold a 
hearing on alternative ways to meet secondary treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Sierra Club and the three council members -- Bob Filner, John Hartley 
and Linda Bernhardt -- say the city can have secondary treatment as required by 
the Clean Water Act without spending billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
After years of legal fighting, the city and the EPA agreed in January to a 
consent decree requiring San Diego to build six water reclamation plants and 
two secondary sewage treatment plants at a cost of nearly $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal judge in the case, Rudi Brewster, who must approve the consent 
decree, has called for a Nov. 1 hearing to determine if he has the authority to 
review whether the city must proceed with the project. The EPA says he does not 
and that the jurisdiction belongs to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Several scientists have said that San Diego's current method of primary 
treatment -- the city treats about 190 million gallons a day at its Point Loma 
plant -- is not harmful to the ocean. The scientists, including those who work 
at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, say upgrading to secondary 
treatment would provide only marginal environmental improvement at a cost they 
say is wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there is an alternative that is less costly and more environmentally 
sensitive," said Bill Benjamin, a Sierra Club lawyer. He likened the proposed 
new system to a "Rolls-Royce." 
</P>
<P>
"It's much too expensive and there's ways to meet environmental concerns," 
Benjamin said, noting that the city could save millions of dollars and not have 
to build a South Bay treatment plant by, among other things, embarking on a 
massive retrofitting program of area homes that would dramatically cut down on 
effluent coming into the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said the Sierra Club, which pushed the city to agree to secondary 
treatment, still believes the upgraded system is necessary to comply with the 
Clean Water Act but that different and less expensive methods exist to meet the 
act's standards. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the three council members in their letter to William K. Reilly said: 
"We want to make it clear: We endorse the goals and standards of the Clean 
Water Act. We simply want the flexibility to meet your environmental standards 
by other technologies." 
</P>
<P>
Filner said in an interview that Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) told the three 
council members that the EPA administrator has the authority to decide which 
methods can be used to meet the secondary treatment standard. 
</P>
<P>
Because of new technology in sewage treatment, reclamation and retrofitting, 
the city can comply with the federal law and save $1 billion, Filner contends. 
</P>
<P>
The letter specifically asks the EPA administrator to withdraw from the consent 
decree.

THE HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
Paying for Troops in Japan 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 370 to 53 to require Japan to pay the $5-billion annual cost of 
stationing 50,000 U.S. troops and dependents there. This occurred during debate 
on the fiscal 1991 defense budget (HR 4739). About 5,000 of the Americans would 
be withdrawn annually if Japan declined to start paying for them. U.S. troops 
are based in Japan to protect it as well as American regional interests. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) complained that "American workers are paying 
to protect Japan while Japan closes its markets to us." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent David O'B. Martin (R-N.Y.) said the amendment sends Japan an 
appropriate message but "would be more detrimental to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to require Japan to begin paying for the American troops it 
hosts.

Troops in Korea 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 157 to 265, the House rejected an amendment to bring more troops 
home from South Korea than the White House wants returned as world tensions 
ease. The amendment to the 1991 defense bill (above) sought to reduce U.S. 
forces in South Korea from 43,000 to 30,000 in the next few years, compared to 
the 36,000 level sought by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Robert J. Mrazek (D-N.Y.) said his amendment "would save us $3 billion 
over the next five years without affecting our deterrence capability." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) said: "North Korea has done nothing 
really to . . . change its dictatorial policies to warrant us lowering our 
guard." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cap U.S. military strength in South Korea at 30,000.

Student Loan Forgiveness 
</P>
<P>
The House refused, 200 to 212, to kill student loan forgiveness for new 
borrowers who have joined the proposed "national service." This occurred as the 
House sent to conference with the Senate a bill (HR 4330) establishing the 
volunteer corps, which would place youths in community jobs such as 
conservation and drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment sought to kill language canceling all interest and some principal 
on loans that volunteers receive after the bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Thomas E. Petri (R-Wis.) said Congress should not relinquish to a 
private official, such as a YMCA director, the power to forgive student loans. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Pat Williams (D-Mont.) said Peace Corps and Vista volunteers receive 
the same benefit, so "let's extend it as part of these 'thousand points of 
light' to other young Americans." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to eliminate loan forgiveness for national service volunteers.

GUN MISFIRES; THREATENED TOT UNHURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 2-year-old child narrowly escaped death Friday as an armed robber entered her 
parents' jewelry store on University Avenue and fired a .22-caliber automatic 
pistol at the toddler, but the weapon misfired. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a miracle that the child wasn't killed," San Diego Police Lt. Bruce 
Pfefferkorn said. 
</P>
<P>
The pistol was loaded with a round in the chamber when the suspect, Anh Ngoc 
Nguyen, fired at the little girl, police said. The firing pin struck the 
primer, but the bullet failed to discharge, Pfefferkorn said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Nguyen, 39, entered a jewelry store owned by O.V. Lang and 
Nay Bac in the 4700 block of University Avenue at 4:26 p.m. Nguyen pulled out a 
pistol and attempted to rob the couple, hitting Lang on the head with it. 
</P>
<P>
The parents ran from the store, leaving 2-year-old Sandy Bac inside. 
Pfefferkorn said the mother told police that she saw Nguyen point the gun at 
the child and pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
As the mother watched from outside the store, other witnesses called police. 
Officer David Headley arrived moments later and moved toward the store, 
Pfefferkorn said. Headley yelled at Nguyen to come out and the suspect left the 
store, leaving the gun and child inside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen was taken to County Jail downtown. Pfefferkorn said Nguyen was being 
held on suspicion of a number of changes, including attempted murder, assault 
with a deadly weapon, robbery, felony child endangerment and false arrest.

DEPUTY WOUNDS UNARMED SUSPECTED CAR THIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy shot and wounded an unarmed suspected car thief early Friday 
morning, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Gary Powell, 25, of Fallbrook was booked into County Jail at Vista on 
suspicion of possession of stolen property, vehicle theft and fleeing arrest, 
after he was treated at Fallbrook Hospital for a single gunshot wound to his 
right thigh, sheriff's Lt. John Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department gave the following description of events: 
</P>
<P>
Authorities received a call about 4:16 a.m. that a pickup had been stolen. 
Deputy James McClain was on patrol near West Lilac and South Mission roads in 
Fallbrook when he spotted a truck that matched the description. 
</P>
<P>
McClain saw the truck turn left onto Olive Hill Road against the light and 
followed it, notifying dispatchers that he intended to pull the driver over. 
</P>
<P>
The truck stopped, but as McClain approached it took off again, west on Olive 
Hill Road. McClain got back in his vehicle and chased the truck on narrow, 
winding roads at speeds of up to 50 m.p.h. The truck slowed down as if to stop 
a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deputy received confirmation that the truck was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, on a paved road that runs parallel to the 500 block of Morro Hills, 
the suspect stopped the truck and got out. McClain got out of his vehicle with 
his .357 Magnum revolver drawn and told the suspect to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the deputy noticed the truck was coasting backward, so he 
moved out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently in response to the deputy's movement, the suspect turned abruptly 
toward the left, away from the truck and toward McClain. He also moved his 
right hand near his waistband, a spot the deputy could not see because of the 
way the suspect was standing. The suspect then apparently moved his hand 
forward in a way that made the deputy fear the man was holding a gun. 
</P>
<P>
McClain fired five shots, hitting the man once in the right thigh. The suspect, 
who was unarmed, fell to the ground and was handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department is investigating the shooting. McClain, 41, a 
four-year veteran, will be placed on administrative leave, Deputy Robbie Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell was the fourth person shot this year by deputies. Two of the shootings 
were fatal.

DAVE DISTEL: WRONG MAN GETS BLAME FOR TEAM'S TROUBLES

<P>
Jack McKeon sauntered into the hotel lobby at 12:15 Friday, carrying an attache 
large enough for at least a week's supply of his ever-present cigars. 
</P>
<P>
Unseen was the burden of not really knowing what was in store for him in the 
minutes and months to come. 
</P>
<P>
Was it a good sign, for example, that he was politely asked to wait in the hall 
until called upon by the Padre ownership group meeting in a nearby room? Was it 
a good sign that he didn't even know who was in that nearby room? 
</P>
<P>
Would he like a hood or a blindfold? 
</P>
<P>
Didn't he feel a little bit as if he were about to confront a literal or 
figurative firing squad? 
</P>
<P>
It sure didn't seem like it. He exchanged pleasantries with the hotel staff and 
then made himself comfortable in a chair. Yawn. 
</P>
<P>
If this man was about to be fired, he sure was at peace. Of course, the fact 
that he has another $400,000 year on his contract might have been a bit of a 
soothing influence. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt this will even deal with my situation," he said. "We have one of these 
meetings every year to go over baseball operations. As far as I'm concerned, 
I'm the boss . . . doing what I do." 
</P>
<P>
But for how long? 
</P>
<P>
Not even McKeon could be positive going into this meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 12:29, he reached into his pocket for a cigar. Maybe he could smoke 
'em out. 
</P>
<P>
At exactly 12:30, managing general partner Tom Werner beckoned. Unlit, the 
cigar went back into the pocket. This wasn't to be an occasion for blowing 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Much about the direction of this franchise was examined in that room Friday 
morning and afternoon. McKeon's status had to be part of the discussions, 
regardless of whether he was in the room. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon's role, as he saw it, was simply to deliver an organizational report. 
The size of the attache case probably reflected the sheaf of notes he would 
need to detail this organization's problems. He couldn't deal with all of them, 
because the room had not been booked for overnight occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, the gathered hierarchy would have been wise to view McKeon 
as a messenger rather than as the cause of what has gone wrong this dismal 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
They don't shoot -- or fire -- messengers, do they? 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, the general manager, had to be most concerned about having been 
undercut by Jack McKeon, the manager, and undone by his superiors in the front 
office. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, the manager, was remiss in May when he did not actively address what 
had obviously become a major chemical imbalance on this team. One faction had 
aligned itself against Tony Gwynn. That situation should have been handled in a 
firm and final fashion. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
And so this fragmented ship continued to drift aimlessly, McKeon the general 
manager dismissed McKeon the manager and settled for the relative sanity of his 
old desk job. 
</P>
<P>
Lo and behold, Tony Gwynn and his detractors would again be thrust into the 
spotlight a couple of weeks ago. You know, The Case of the Hanging Figurine. 
</P>
<P>
This episode rightly infuriated Gwynn. Because the previous situation had 
festered, he assumed one of his teammates had been the perpetrator of the nasty 
deed. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the organization did absolutely nothing. Dick Freeman, the club 
president, should have promptly announced that the club would investigate, 
identify and punish the culprit. Gwynn, like the figurine, was left to hang by 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
And so The Times published a story this week detailing Gwynn's anguish and, 
presto, the next day Freeman announced that a member of the grounds crew had 
fessed up to doing the deed with no evil intent. 
</P>
<P>
This may well be true, but it seems awful convenient and coincidental to me. 
</P>
<P>
What it did, however, was give those critical of Gwynn an opportunity to 
quietly berate him for having the audacity to accuse a teammate of such an act. 
It's been that kind of a summer for Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
And the Gwynn situation is central to what is wrong with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The mix is not right. 
</P>
<P>
True, Jack McKeon put it together. However, in his defense, it would have been 
difficult to foresee that grown men would stoop to schoolyard cliquishness. 
</P>
<P>
This house has to be cleaned and put in order, and McKeon should have been the 
guy to do it. He, like Gwynn, became a victim of a faction of children 
masquerading as grown men in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Not having been privy to McKeon's oratory, I don't know if this was the essence 
of what he said. But it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
When he left the room 72 minutes later, he seemed bemused that the gathered 
press should be concerned lest he had joined the ranks of the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going right back to the office," he said, lighting a cigar. "I've gotta go 
to work." 
</P>
<P>
Much work is to be done, but Jack McKeon won't be the guy doing it. He was 
right. The meeting hadn't dealt with his situation. That was clarified in a new 
release early in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the cigar was lit, but the fire was out.

MCKEON LOSES THE BATTLE TO KEEP HIS JOB; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: REDS MAINTAIN LEAD BY ROUTING THE PADRES, 10-1, IN FRONT OF A LARGE 
CROWD THAT BOOS THE HOME TEAM.

<P>
It would be stretching the point to say that the Padres offered even token 
resistance to the title-seeking Reds at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds mauled ex-teammate Dennis Rasmussen for five runs in the first inning 
and two more in the second en route to a 10-1 victory that preserved their 3 
1/2-game lead over the Dodgers in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
A paid crowd of 44,717, lured in large measure by a postgame fireworks display, 
booed loudly and often as the Padres were mathematically eliminated from the 
race that many experts predicted they would dominate. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the Padres also were knocked out by the Reds at home a year 
ago, but the circumstances were quite different then. Instead of stumbling 
along in fourth place as they are now, the Padres of 1989 were to finish 
second, only three games behind the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Reds right-hander Jose Rijo was as sharp as Rasmussen was flat, breezing to a 
five-hitter that ran his record to 13-7 and lowering his ERA to 2.75. He was in 
trouble only in the first and final innings. In the first the Padres loaded the 
bases with two out before Benito Santiago bounced in to a force-out. In the 
ninth, the Padres touched Rijo for their only run. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Larkin and Eric Davis hit home runs and Mariano Duncan contributed three 
singles as the Reds totaled 13 hits off Rasmussen, Calvin Schiraldi and Eric 
Show. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts was the only Padre who wasn't mystified by Rijo's pitching. He had 
three singles in four at-bats, raising his average to .311., and his third 
started a ninth-inning "rally," by which the Padres averted a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts moved up on a walk to Jerald Clark and scored on Joe Carter's single. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo was pitching on three days rest for the first time this season, but 
continued a streak in which he has posted a 5-1 record and a 1.11 earned-run 
average in his last seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
"He has just been overpowering," Reds Manager Lou Piniella said. "We've got him 
throwing between starts, which he wasn't doing earlier because of tenderness in 
his back. I was going to get (remove) him after they got that run, but he 
wanted to stay in." 
</P>
<P>
That dismayed Padre catcher Mark Parent, who batted against Rijo twice. "My 
first at-bat, I hit the ball well," he said. "But the next time up (with the 
bases loaded in the ninth), I was mad that Piniella left him in. He threw three 
of the nastiest sliders I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
The victory reduced the Reds' magic number to 9 with 12 games remaining, and 
Piniella said, "The Dodgers (16-3 winners Friday over the Giants) are scoring a 
lot of runs, but if we win nine, we don't have to worry about anything. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys out here have stayed loose through all this (recent slump), 
contrary to what some people say about them. We feel real good right now." 
</P>
<P>
In the Padre clubhouse, Manager Greg Riddoch was philosophical about his team's 
elimination from the race. 
</P>
<P>
"The fat lady sings," Riddoch said. "I have to look at things realistically. We 
knew there was a point where we were no longer in it, but we weren't trying to 
be in it after that. We were trying to find ourselves, and I think we've done 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds wasted no time with Rasmussen. An error by shortstop Garry Templeton 
made four of their five first-inning runs unearned, but there was nothing 
tainted about any of the four hits that keyed the uprising. They batted around 
in a marathon session that brought no fewer than six choruses of boos from the 
big crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hatcher led off with a single, was sacrificed to second by Duncan, stole 
third as Larkin struck out and scored on Davis' double. 
</P>
<P>
It was when Davis doubled that the fans began booing. The hit should have been 
only a routine single, but center fielder Carter was so slow in fielding it 
that Davis kept on running and the Padre faithful showed their displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sabo followed with a grounder that Templeton picked up, then dropped. 
That brought more boos, and by that time the fans were on as big a roll as the 
Reds. They booed after a walk to Glenn Braggs filled the bases, after Hal 
Morris singled in two runs, after Joe Oliver doubled in two more, and even 
after Rijo made the third out at last by missing a bunt attempt on the third 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
His horrendous first inning notwithstanding, Rasmussen was allowed to answer 
the bell for the second. He retired the first two batters, but then Larkin and 
Davis hit successive home runs, and Sabo singled. The flurry set off three more 
rounds of boos, the last of which suddenly subsided when Sabo made too wide a 
turn and was run down between first and second. 
</P>
<P>
Mercifully, Rasmussen was removed for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the 
second. Schiraldi then matched zeroes with Rijo for four innings before 
yielding a run in the seventh on Duncan's single, Larkin's double and Davis' 
infield out.

NEWSWIRE: POLICE MISTAKE CELTICS' BROWN FOR BANK ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dee Brown, a member of the Boston Celtics, said he was held at gunpoint by 
several Wellesley, Mass., police officers who apparently thought he was a bank 
robbery suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Brown told WCVB-TV in Boston he was sitting in his car with his fiancee, 
reading through mail, when police approached him and ordered him to get out and 
lie on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked . . . terrified," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he and his fiancee were considering buying a home in Wellesley, a 
wealthy suburb outside Boston. But Friday's incident changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I don't want to live there," he said. "I see myself laying on the ground, 
a gun pointing at the back of my head." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he believed police singled him out because they thought he matched 
the description of someone who robbed a nearby bank last week. 
</P>
<P>
A Wellesley police dispatcher, who declined to be named, said bank employees 
had called the bank because they were suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"There was just a misunderstanding. The bank employees thought it was somebody 
else," he said.

GWYNN LEAVES QUIETLY 
</P>

Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn, finding himself mired in controversy and 
misunderstanding, cleaned out his locker at 9:30 Friday morning, leaving hours 
before seeing his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn refused to comment on the latest development in his troubled season -- 
the team's announcement it has found the culprit who hung a mutilated doll of 
Gwynn two weeks ago in the Padre dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Padre President Dick Freeman said that a member of the seven-man ground crew, 
feeling guilty about the controversy it had created, confessed to the act. The 
employee will be disciplined, but not fired, according to Bill Wilson, manager 
of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The doll was found hanging by a chain, with its arms and feet cut off, before a 
Sept. 8 game against the Atlanta Braves. Several players, including Gwynn, had 
suspicions that a Padre player might have been responsible for the act. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you feel good that it was an outsider, not that it happened, but that 
it wasn't one of us," Manager Greg Riddoch said. "What it does is put people's 
minds at ease." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre captain Garry Templeton: "I hope the people in San Diego feel better 
about this, because it turned into a really ugly scene." 
</P>
<P>
Templeton was among several Padre players who were upset at Gwynn this week 
after a story in the Times, saying that it was wrong of him to blame the team 
for the act. But Gwynn never blamed the entire team, saying only that he 
thought it could be one of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one big misunderstanding," Riddoch said. "It'll all blow over."

CHANGES DON'T MASK NEEDS OF BULLETS

<P>
"Mediocrity's no crime, Frank!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hawkeye Pierce to Frank Burns, MASH 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Bullets have been mired in just such a bog for the better part 
of 11 years. No matter what they've tried, whom they've drafted, they can't 
escape. As the '90s begin, the Bullets are looking to an infusion of new talent 
and new management to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the old problems have leapfrogged with them: Their best player, forward 
John Williams, is hurt and embroiled in controversy. The player acquired in the 
Jeff Malone trade, Pervis Ellison, has played fewer than 30 NBA regular-season 
games after an injury-plagued rookie season. Bob Ferry, the veteran general 
manager, resigned in the spring, replaced by John Nash, former general manager 
of the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a future, involving not only those players but a front-office 
revival that has produced some of the few good signs from the franchise in the 
past couple of years. Two years ago, the Bullets were so distressed by their 
season-ticket base that they were citing "team policy" that didn't allow them 
to disclose it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they crow about the partial turnaround, which has Washington operating 
from a healthier financial base, with internal improvements plus the combined 
cash cows of expansion and the league's television deals with NBC and cable's 
TNT. 
</P>
<P>
Still, though the 23 established teams have split $130 million over the past 
two years from the four expansion clubs, and though Washington had the 
second-largest increase in average attendance in the league last season, the 
Bullets were among a handful of teams that lost money -- a "considerable 
amount," club owner Abe Pollin said. He didn't disclose figures, but an 
educated guess would put the figure in the low millions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to things improving this year on a financial basis," he 
said. "Obviously, we have a new TV contract, we have a new radio deal (with 
50,000-watt WTOP), we're going to sell more season tickets and we're going to 
have more people come to the games. Last year was a very bad one for us." 
</P>
<P>
Season tickets currently stand at 4,350, an all-time high, 600 more than the 
Bullets' best attendance season, 1978-79, the season after they won the NBA 
championship. Renewals are going at better than 80 percent. Partial ticket 
plans -- for the first time, the team's 13-game package has all weekend games 
-- are doing well. 
</P>
<P>
The new radio deal will raise those revenues 75 percent. Executive vice 
president Susan O'Malley didn't disclose amounts, but did say the team has 
already covered all costs of buying time on WTOP. In addition, the team, as of 
Monday, already had more money from radio revenues than from all of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Team sponsorships are up 50 percent. The club has brought in more than a 
million dollars in sponsorships, O'Malley said, and will have bigger 
commitments this season from Amtrak and Safeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right on target," said general sales manager David Lanzi. "We're very 
pleased with renewals. We're ahead overall of where we were last year. ... A 
lot of people are crying economy right now. We haven't noticed it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Though the salary cap is up to $11.8 million, the Bullets might get closer to 
breaking even this year. Their in-house improvements and television will see to 
that; NBC's $600 million investment, as well as $250 million from TNT for four 
years of telecasts, averages to $8 million per team per year. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, with a team of little-known, uninteresting or unwilling players, 
Coach Wes Unseld was the front office's sole marketing tool. Having been 
successful selling the idea of a younger, more spirited team, Washington is now 
looking to a more team-oriented approach. Guard Ledell Eackles has spent most 
of the summer in the Washington area doing clinics and the like, and now, at 
least two players appear in all advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff (Malone) is very shy," O'Malley said, "so he didn't want to market 
himself. If you're not on a great team, you don't get noticed. And on the 
marketing side, they didn't do well with tickets. They didn't have a lot of 
revenue. We didn't do a very good job of getting to the market and marketing 
our players." 
</P>
<P>
On the court, Williams's knee injury and subsequent controversy over his 
rehabilitation has cast a pall over the club's immediate future. He is a major 
talent, and the Bullets have spent the better part of three seasons waiting for 
him to step to the next level and take the team along. But the devasting knee 
injury of Dec. 2 has been followed by major disagreements about his 
rehabilitation, culminating in the team's decision two months ago not to pay 
Williams until he continues rehab sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The team officials have not spoken directly to Williams since early August, but 
Pollin said last week that he was going through informal channels to try to 
reach Williams, who has been in Los Angeles all summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets are trying to stay low-key about all this. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to worry about that until I see him on the court Oct. 5," Unseld 
said last week, referring to the date veterans are scheduled to report to 
training camp. "Because it doesn't do me any good to wonder otherwise. ... I, 
as a player, would do things the way I did them that made me a player to begin 
with. I trust that's John's situation. If he's not ready, then I've got a 
problem. ... What choice do I have? I've got 11 or 13 other guys to worry about 
too. I can spend all my time worrying about one individual, or I can go on and 
worry about those things I can have some control over." 
</P>
<P>
"I've told John that God has given him a talent superior to most other people," 
Pollin said. "We've had long talks, John and I. I'm very fond of John. ... What 
bothers me is his actions, and I hope we can get that turned around. I'm going 
to try and resolve it as soon as I can. I might not succeed but I'm sure going 
to give it a helluva effort." 
</P>
<P>
Gone are two of the team's longtime mainstays, Ferry and Malone. Ferry's 
departure was a surprise, and when he announced his resignation, he noted 
concerns about Pollin's ability to heft the freight of big-time NBA salaries. 
Pollin then took the unusual step of publicly disagreeing with his longtime 
friend, and says today he "doesn't know what Bob was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pollin: "Just recently, I saw Len Elmore on television. I remarked to 
somebody -- I think it might have been my wife -- I said, 'there's the only 
player I ever lost in 26 years because I didn't come up with enough money.' He 
went to Indiana in the ABA, because I wouldn't match the numbers, as far as 
dollars. And that's a fact. I have spent whatever dollars it takes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to throw the dollars away for what I think are unproven players, 
or whatever. As a prudent owner and businessman, I have never, ever said 'No, 
we're not going to do this because we can't afford it.' If I did, things would 
be different. But I don't. I have put out the dough when there was enough 
reason to put out the dough." 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets have signed Mark Price and Eddie Lee Wilkens to offer sheets in the 
past, and made overtures about getting forward Otis Thorpe before he was traded 
to Houston. Washington's problem is that the team is coming off a 31-51 
campaign and hasn't been past the first round of the playoffs since 1982. Thus, 
unrestricted free agents such as Sam Perkins see little reason to sign here 
when they can go to contenders that are only a player or two away from the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
Said current general manager Nash: "I'm confident that Abe will spend his 
money. Pervis -- I don't like to talk about player salaries -- makes 
significantly more than Jeff Malone. (Ellison will make $1.8 million this 
season, while Malone made just more than $1 million last season.) When I told 
Abe we had an opportunity to secure Pervis Ellison for Jeff Malone, he didn't 
even ask. But I'm sure he knows." 
</P>
<P>
The Malone trade is a gamble, taking a chance that Ellison, injured for most of 
last season in Sacramento after being the first pick overall in the '89 draft, 
can begin to give Washington some interior presence. 
</P>
<P>
Public reaction to the Malone trade has been muted, and cautiously optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"It made a lot of difference in our renewals," O'Malley said. "Not that 
marketing and the team work hand in hand, but it did happen three days before 
the renewal deadline. We had a lot of activity after that. I think there were a 
lot of fence-sitters." 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley didn't recall many calls against the trade, "but a lot of people were 
saying 'something must be wrong with Pervis,' " she said. "Because how could 
you get a big man for a guard?' " 
</P>
<P>
If Williams returns effectively, and one of the young players -- a Harvey 
Grant, a Tom Hammonds -- develops further, the Bullets foresee a talented front 
court that can compete. 
</P>
<P>
Hammonds, who spent the summer at alma mater Georgia Tech to get his degree, is 
at 220 pounds after taking part in ballhandling drills and playing nearly every 
day with the Atlanta Hawks. Grant has filled out noticeably to about 225 after 
another summer with weights both in Kansas and here with Bullets strength coach 
Dennis Householder. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams has a long, long way to go before he can even get back on the 
court. Eackles has shown potential for two years, but can he play starter's 
minutes? Ellison is up to 225 pounds after an offseason weightlifting regimen, 
but will he keep the extra muscle over the course of a season? Bernard King is 
a wonder, but a 33-year-old wonder, and can't be considered a part of the 
Bullets' long-term future. 
</P>
<P>
When Unseld was asked last week about his new young nucleus, he said: "Right 
now, I wouldn't call it anything. It's still way too early." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Bullets have a lot of the complementary pieces. If they 
could acquire the franchise-type player -- the kind found in the first two or 
three picks of the draft -- they could turn it around a lot sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Nash concedes the Bullets don't have a turn-around player on their team. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably fair," he said. "There are really two ways to get those types 
of players. We parted with an all-star caliber player in Jeff Malone for Pervis 
Ellison. We can't do that again. ... John Williams, not only in our eyes, but 
to everyone else in the NBA, remains a question mark until he gets back on the 
floor and plays again. And because of his age, Bernard King doesn't get what 
he's worth. We still need that player."

CRESPI NO MATCH FOR LOYOLA IN 21-0 DEFEAT; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: UNDEFEATED CUBS DOMINATE THE CELTS, WHO SUFFER THEIR FIRST LOSS 
IN FOUR STARTS. 
</P>

<P>
The Loyola-Crespi high school football rivalry might go back only 17 years, but 
the teams have packed a lot of excitement into those annual meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few seasons, the two regularly have squared off for the Del Rey 
League title. During the past off-season, however, the two all-boys Catholic 
schools were split up, Loyola moving to the Angelus League and Crespi shifting 
to the Mission League. 
</P>
<P>
They tried to rekindle the old spirit in a nonleague contest Friday night. But, 
about the only thing it did for Crespi was make the Celts perhaps a little 
grateful that they no longer have to deal with the Cubs with a playoff berth at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs rocked Crespi, 21-0, before a near-capacity crowd at Pierce College in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"That's as good as we've played all year," Cub Coach Steve Grady said. "I had 
my doubts going in." 
</P>
<P>
He shouldn't have. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (3-0) rolled up 317 yards and dominated on both sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts (3-1), who have made their name over the past five seasons with an 
impressive running attack behind the likes of Russell White and Leonice Brown, 
ran the ball 14 times for 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody gets whupped once in a while," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. 
"Hopefully, it will only be once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, ranked No. 2 in the Southern Section Division I poll, used a balanced 
attack that was paced by the passing of Corby Smith and the running of Matt 
Vanis. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a senior and the son of USC Coach Larry Smith, completed 11 of 16 passes 
for 124 yards. Vanis gained 105 yards in 24 carries and scored a pair of 
first-half touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who also scrambled for 24 yards in five carries, scored the Cubs' final 
touchdown, a one-yard sneak on the first play of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi's Cody Smith completed 14 of 26 for 115 yards, but much of the yardage 
came in the fourth quarter with the game already well in Loyola's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi's inconsistent offense figured to have trouble against the Cub defense. 
The surprise came when Loyola had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts had yielded only 23 total points in impressive wins over highly 
touted Kahuku of Hawaii, Redlands and Hart. They soon found out that Loyola was 
none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
"They just dominated us," Lins said. "They were very well prepared and beat us 
going away." 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation, perhaps not surprisingly, made Grady yearn for yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the Del Rey League," he said. "And we've got a good rivalry going. The 
last five or six years, it's been us or them." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, it has been Loyola. With the win, the Cubs improved the series edge to 
14-3-1. The Celts last won in '86. 
</P>
<P>
Corby Smith completed six of 10 first-half passes for 72 yards.

OXNARD KNOCKS OFF RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Channel Islands High was both unbeaten and impressive heading into its 
nonleague football game against Oxnard on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' running game had been nearly unstoppable, and the team had 
averaged 30 points and 275 rushing yards in wins over Rio Mesa and Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
But, after dropping a 36-14 decision to Oxnard at Oxnard High, the beaten 
Raiders aren't very impressive, either. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Renard Carn, who had rushed for 243 yards in the first two games, was 
on the bench because of a stress fracture in his left foot. And Arturo 
Hernandez, one of the top defensive ends in the Marmonte League, also was 
sidelined, because of a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
And the Raiders' woes continued with blocked punts, costly penalties and 
turnovers. Those mistakes overshadowed Lamont Pearson's 104 rushing yards in 
nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't look very good at all," Channel Islands Coach Joel Gershon 
said. "We didn't even look like a football team." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands' mistakes made a good Oxnard (2-1) team look even better. 
Oxnard turned four critical Channel Islands errors into four touchdowns and the 
Yellowjackets finished with 233 rushing yards and 313 total. 
</P>
<P>
"We played about as good as we can play," Oxnard Coach Jack Davis said. "But I 
also think that we caught (Channel Islands) on a bad night." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands' troubles began when Oxnard, leading 6-0 on John Lewis' 
two-yard run, blocked a Raider punt. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Gutierrez smothered Juan Vargas' kick at Channel Islands' 26 and Oxnard's 
Nathan Stephens recovered the ball at the 15. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Kenyon Lewis (150 yards in 18 carries) scored on a 27-yard 
run and John Lewis' two-point conversion gave Oxnard a 14-0 lead with 8 minutes 
34 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"After that blocked punt, we really had the momentum," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands' next mistake was a personal foul, during an Oxnard punt, which 
gave the Yellowjackets a first down at Channel Islands' 32. Quarterback Larry 
Bumpus hit Kenyon Lewis for a 26-yard gain to the 10, and Bumpus scored on a 
six-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Duchai's point-after extended Oxnard's lead to 21-0 with 3:09 left in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some critical mistakes," Gershon said. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands finally reached the end zone on an 11-yard pass from 
quarterback Pharoh Milner to Ricky Rodriguez with nine seconds left in the 
half. Milner added the conversion run to cut Oxnard's lead to 21-8 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Oxnard took advantage of a pair of Channel Islands fumbles in the second 
half to turn the game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
First, Milner fumbled at the Raiders' 39, and Oxnard capitalized, scoring on a 
17-yard touchdown pass from Bumpus to Brooke Johnson. Kenyon Lewis' conversion 
run extended Oxnard's lead to 29-8 with 11:51 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Then another fumbled by Milner resulted in a 32-yard pass from Bumpus to 
Johnson that gave Oxnard a 36-8 lead with 9:45 left. Bumpus completed four of 
six passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands concluded the scoring when Milner, who rushed for 72 yards in 
14 carries, scored on a three-yard run with 2:43 left.

La Canada 20, Burroughs 7 -- After scoring its first touchdown of the season, 
Burroughs surrendered the final 20 points in a loss at La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs (0-3), which had been outscored, 91-0, entering the game, scored 
first on Eric Arcinega's one-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. The run 
capped a 25-yard drive, which was set up by Eric Levandofsky's fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Marco Esquivel accounted for most of Burroughs' offense, completing 
five of 18 for 46 yards, but he was sacked five times. Ben Goldwasser was the 
Indians' top rusher, gaining 18 yards in seven carries. CHARLIE PLOWMAN

CLEVELAND'S GAME PLAN GOES AWRY IN 21-7 LOSS

<P>
Cleveland High football Coach Steve Landress scripted Cleveland's first few 
series of plays Friday night when his club played host to Fairfax in a 
nonleague opener. 
</P>
<P>
But his players suffered from opening-night jitters and fell, 21-7, as Fairfax 
scored three fourth-period touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"The script worked for the first series and then it broke down," Landress said. 
"Back to the drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland appeared to be in command after two periods, leading, 7-0, while 
holding Fairfax to 43 yards and two first downs. But the Lions roared in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After forcing David Erhardt to punt from his own seven, Fairfax took over at 
the Cavalier 41, and four plays later, quarterback Rahim Muhammad tossed a 
25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Eduardo Payan. Milo Bynum's kick tied the 
game at seven with 10:43 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Erhardt, who doubles as the Cavalier quarterback, fumbled a fake pitch on 
Cleveland's next series. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions took the lead by using the hook-and-ladder play, as Muhammad threw a 
three-yard pass to Bynum, who turned and pitched to Tharen Todd, who went 34 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax scored again with 1 minute 44 seconds left when Muhammad went 56 yards 
on a quarterback sneak. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland stayed primarily on the ground in the first half, moving the ball 
effectively but scoring only once. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers took over at their 38-yard line after a Mario Mattison fumble and 
Erhardt threw 12 yards to Manny Valencia to put the ball at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
A two-yard gain by Ibn Bilal and two Erhardt completions moved the ball to the 
21, and Delvon McDaniel took over from there, carrying the final four plays of 
the drive and scoring on a five-yard run. Brent Sapiro added the kick. 
</P>

EL CAMINO REAL WINS BEHIND 3 TOUCHDOWNS FROM MARINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Ryan Marine scored a touchdown in each of the first three quarters to spark El 
Camino Real High to a 21-7 victory over Monroe in a nonleague football game at 
Monroe on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores played an outstanding defensive game, applying a bevy of 
brutal hits in the secondary while holding Monroe to just 32 yards on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Hernandez set up El Camino Real's first touchdown when he recovered a 
fumble on Monroe's eight yard-line on the second offensive play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Marine took over from there, breaking two tackles on an eight-yard touchdown 
run up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe tied the score, 7-7, with 2 minutes 50 seconds to go in the first half 
on Ramy Antoun's 34-yard pass to Gene Hodge, who caught the ball over his left 
shoulder in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But El Camino Real wasn't about to settle for a halftime tie. The 
Conquistadores marched 63 yards in seven plays, Marine scoring his second 
touchdown on an eight-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Marine finished with 85 yards in 18 carries, and teammate Chris Griggs added 50 
yards in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
The go-ahead score was set up on a 39-yard pass from Evan Howland to Jon 
Speier, who was lying on his back at the eight-yard line when the ball 
deflected off a defender and landed between his legs. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real's third score came quickly after intermission. Starting from 
their own 32-yard line after the kickoff, the Conquistadores used the tandem of 
Marine and Griggs to move downfield in five plays. Marine scored is final 
touchdown on a 19-yard dash off left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe's Jason St. John, a 6-foot, 190-pound converted tackle, made his debut 
at fullback but carried just seven times for 16 yards. Andrew Rich, a 
sophomore, was the leading rusher for Monroe, carrying seven times for 19 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Antoun was the offensive star for Monroe, completing seven of 18 passes for 100 
yards. But he threw two interceptions and was twice called for intentional 
grounding. 
</P>
<P>
Hodge, a 5-9, 140-pound senior, caught four passes for 48 yards for Monroe.

THE BIG GAME; 
</P>
<P>
GROSSMONT DOWNS MT. MIGUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before Friday's game against Mt. Miguel, Grossmont Coach Judd Hulbert talked a 
lot about big plays and how the Matadors, who entered the game 2-0, were prone 
to score quick and often. 
</P>
<P>
He never once let on about his own team's scoring ability. He doesn't have to 
now. No. 6 Grossmont, 2-0, a team with a reputation for grinding it out, had 
three touchdown plays of over 50 yards en route to a 33-16 victory in front of 
an estimated crowd of 2,000 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the Foothillers' scores came on or after, you guessed it, big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a big-play team, too,' Hulbert said afterward. 'We're gojng to be OK. 
But we still need to be able to grind it out." 
</P>
<P>
Junior running back Jason Eskridge rushed for 142 yards on 11 carries. Most of 
it came on touchdown runs of 63 and 78 yards in the first half. He also had a 
52-yard reception for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont's game plan going in was to control the line of scrimmage and pound 
away inside with Eskridge, while hoping to neutralize the big-play ability of 
Mount Miguel's option attack, which centered around tailback Earl Bryers, who 
finished 22-130 rushing, with a 65-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
So, on the game's first play from scrimmage, the unexpected happened. Eskridge 
took a handoff on a simple dive over guard, seemingly with the idea of 
softening up Mt. Miguel's defensive front, and exploded untouched for his 
63-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the second quarter, with Grossmont leading 7-3, the Foothillers opened 
a drive at their own 22-yard line and decided to pitch to Eskridge. He broke 
toward the right sideline then reversed his field. Gone. Seventy-eight yards. 
Grossmont led 13-3 after the kick failed. 
</P>
<P>
Then the expected happened. Mt. Miguel came right back to score on it's first 
play from scrimmage when Troy Stephens (10-124 rushing) scored on a 75-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
That score, along with Jose Rael's 38-yard field goal, made it a 13-10 game at 
halftime. But, midway through the fourth quarter, what looked like a barnburner 
in the making was . . . gone. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont quarterback Tom Karlo, who was 2-6 for nine yards passing to that 
point, found Eskridge in the open with a 52-yard scoring strike, Ron Benitez 
scooped up fumble and ran 18 yards for a touchdown and an interception by David 
Arabia set up a nine-yard touchdown pass by Karlo to Jamie Cauldren. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont scored three touchdowns in 5:07 to break the game open.

INJURED TEAMMATE INSPIRES MIRA MESA TO BEAT CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The guy with the ice packs, the sweat dripping profusely and the ear-to-ear 
grin made the call. 
</P>
<P>
Jomo Graham, Mira Mesa's offensive and defensive lineman, explained that No. 4 
Mira Mesa (3-0) wasn't going to let the early injury to David Walker, fellow 
lineman and friend, mean nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone just kept getting reminded of him," said Graham. 
</P>
<P>
With Walker, who was taken to a hospital with a back injury, in mind, Mira Mesa 
was able to hold off a last-gasp Chula Vista drive and defeat the visitors, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa had prepared itself for Chula Vista's hard driving defense and had 
hoped to capitalized on a shaky offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they'd be tough on defense," Mira Mesa Coach Brad Griffith said, "and 
we thought their offense might sputter." 
</P>
<P>
They just hadn't anticipated their production on offense would be shut down so 
effectively. Only Mike Bovee leg saved them. Quarterback/kicker Bovee, in his 
first three field goal attempts of the season, make two of them, kicking a 
38-yard through the uprights in the third quarter and booting another 42-yard 
beauty, with 10 yards to spare, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"They did hold us," Graham said. "They gave us some problems." 
</P>
<P>
And with 2:44 remaining, Mira Mesa had another big problem when Wayne Pittman, 
the Marauders workhouse running back, fumbled, and Chula Vista took over on its 
own 44-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just breaking down a little," Graham said. "We were a little tired 
from rushing so much." 
</P>
<P>
After stalling on its first two plays of the drive, quarterback Alan Delos 
Reyes found Neviette Richardson for a gain of 28 yards, and the next three 
plays resulted a loss of six yards. 
</P>
<P>
But on fourth and 16 from Mira Mesa's 40, Reyes threw deep . . . into the 
waiting arms of defensive back Quantell Donigan, who made the catch at the 12. 
</P>
<P>
"It just came my way," said Donigan. "I wanted it to be big." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista (1-2), who three games into the season has more losses than last 
year when it finished 10-1-1, biggest threat came after Bovee's early fourth 
quarter field goal. The Spartans ran the ball 11 times on 11 plays and picked 
up 53 yards behind the running of Richardson, Steve Gomez and LeMar Bailey. But 
Chula Vista couldn't convert on fourth and one from Mira Mesa's 37, and the 
Marauders took over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa's Pittman totaled with 123 yards on 23 carries, and teammate Robbie 
Edwards rushed 14 times for 78 carries. 
</P>
<P>
For Chula Vista, Gomez picked up 68 on 14 carries and Bailey rushed 55 yards on 
four carries. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

NOWLAN CONSIDERS VICTORIES A TEAM EFFORT

Immediately after Juliana Nowlan was presented with three Masters World Cup 
cycling jerseys Friday night, she walked over to teammates Debbie Durand and 
Tani Barbour and handed each a jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have won the points race without you," Nowlan told them. "You 
deserve these too." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the women's 25-34 points race, Nowlan, of La Mesa, won the 
one-kilometer time trial, and three-kilometer pursuit at the World Cup track 
finals at the velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
In the points race, Durand placed second and Barbour placed fourth. All three 
are members of the South Bay Bicycle team. 
</P>
<P>
"We ride as a team," Nowlan said. "When somebody wins, we all win." 
</P>
<P>
Nowlan took up cycling five years ago after a doctor encouraged her to ride as 
a form of rehabilitation for her knees, which she injured running. 
</P>
<P>
She has been competing for four years and in addition to the track, competes in 
road races. Nowlan said the endurance training she does on the road aided her 
in this competition. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I was able to do the kilometer then the pursuit 40 minutes later," 
Nowlan said. "I've worked hard on my endurance." 
</P>
<P>
Nowlan, who received her undergraduate degree in exercise physiology from San 
Diego State, is taking classes at Grossmont College to become a cardio-vascular 
technician. She is currently doing her clinical labs at a hospital, which is 
taking up some of her training time. 
</P>
<P>
She tries to train at the velodrome at twice a week and will continue to race 
at the facility every Friday night until Oct. 26, when racing concludes for the 
season. She said that having the World Cup here was nice but added a little 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my friends came out and when your friends are around you feel you 
have to win," Nowlan said. 
</P>
<P>
Another world champion who must work her training around a hectic work schedule 
is Alice Church, who won the women's 35-39 match sprint and the one-kilometer 
pursuit and placed third in the criterium. 
</P>
<P>
Church, who has been a flight attendant for American Airlines for 15 years, 
divides her residence between New York City and Sunny Isles, Fla. She said that 
although she occasionally competes in the criterium, track racing better fits 
her busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"As a flight attendant it's very hard to train and sometimes I'm on my feet 14 
hours a day," Church said. "That's why I chose track and sprint racing. To 
develop into a good road racer or criterium racer you need to put in more 
mileage." 
</P>
<P>
Church, who has been cycling since 1987, already has a pile of medals in her 
collection. Among them are two silver medals she won in the match sprint and 
one-kilometer race in the Masters Nationals here in July.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: HENDERSON SAYS HE'LL SIGN 9-MONTH DEAL WITH SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Henderson, the fourth pick in the Major Soccer League draft, said he will 
sign a nine-month contract with the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
"They've offered me a contract and I'm happy with the offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"For sure I'll sign it and get it back to them on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Cady, Sockers' president, would say only that the team is still negotiating 
with Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted from Washington, Henderson is said to have the speed of Socker 
defensive runner Paul Wright, considered the fastest player in the MSL, but 
Henderson shook his head at that. 
</P>
<P>
"If we ran a 100-yard dash, he would beat me," Henderson said. "I just have 
people fooled. My quickness is in my first three steps and I play the ball 
early so I don't get beat." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson (5-foot-1, 145 pounds) is expected to be among the Sockers' most 
bountiful draft. Defender Marcelo Balboa of the U.S. national team, selected 
with the first overall pick, said he will not report until signed, and Cady has 
already gone on record saying that would not be a problem. Defender David 
Banks, a third-round pick from Philadelphia Textile, is also expected to be 
signed, and Eric Yamamoto, a goalie taken in the fourth round from Santa Clara, 
may stay as well. 
</P>
<P>
In other matters, the Sockers cut Bob Lilley, the only free-agent defender with 
professional indoor experience brought into camp. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not what they bring with them," said Erich Geyer, Sockers' assistant 
coach. "It's what they show on the field." JOHN GEIS

Canada will reduce its troops in Europe by 1,400 next year, Defense Minister 
Bill McKnight announced in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts will be made at two Canadian bases in West Germany. "These are 
budget-driven reductions," McKnight said. He promised there would be no change 
in Canada's role in NATO as a result of the cuts. Canada has about 8,000 troops

About 300 Nicaraguan police cleared striking workers from the government bus 
depot in Managua, and tires smoldered in city streets from anti-government 
disturbances led by Sandinista unions. At the same time, the government, 
businesses and some unions met for a second day in talks aimed at rescuing the 
economy. The Sandinistas oppose large-scale layoffs, a part of President 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's austerity plan.

UCLA Coach Terry Donahue is most concerned about his defensive unit in today's 
game against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins weren't able to stop Oklahoma's running attack, which is 
understandable because that's what the Sooners do best. Nor were they able to 
slow Stanford's ground game. They have yielded an average of 227 yards rushing 
in those two games. 
</P>
<P>
Now here comes Michigan, with its veteran offensive line averaging 290 pounds, 
including tackle Greg Skrepenak, who weighs 322.

"Michigan's backs run harder than Stanford's backs," Donahue said. "They hammer 
you, run over you. It's a different approach -- a hardball, smash-mouth 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is that they'll ball-control us to death." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's defensive problems are compounded by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Strong safety Matt Darby has a shoulder injury, and Donahue said his status is 
marginal. Two of his right cornerbacks, Dion Lambert and Robert Gamble, are 
playing despite injuries, and a third, Damion Lyons, didn't make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, UCLA will confront Michigan's massive offensive line with three 
alternating nose guards -- Emanuel Onwutuebe, Kim Lawhorn and Matt Werner, who 
are regarded as average players. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the element of Michigan trying for its first victory for Coach 
Gary Moeller, who replaced Bo Schembechler this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are still brooding over a 28-24 season-opening loss to 
top-ranked Notre Dame, a game they let get away after leading, 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in the factor of UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox, a redshirt freshman 
starting for the first time before an anticipated crowd of more than 100,000 at 
Michigan Stadium, and Donahue can't get back to Pacific 10 competition fast 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our offense can match up with their defense, but I don't think our 
defense matches up with their offense," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan gained 443 yards against Notre Dame, sophomore tailback Jon Vaughn 
running for 201 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Elvis Grbac threw a costly interception into the end zone while 
Michigan was protecting a 24-21 lead. Still, he completed 17 of 30 passes for 
190 yards and two touchdowns against the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Grbac started for the first time last year when Michigan beat UCLA, 24-23, at 
the Rose Bowl in a game the Bruins maintain they should have won. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA led, 23-15, in the fourth quarter when tailback Shawn Wills fumbled at the 
Bruin 43-yard line. The Wolverines scored but failed on a two-point conversion 
try. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:35 remaining, Michigan tried an onside kick. It was a high kick that was 
caught by Vada Murray at the UCLA 46. The Wolverines drove to the winning field 
goal with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
Some UCLA players say that the loss was a psychological factor in a 3-7-1 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"The Michigan game was like a lot of games we played last year. It was in 
reach," he said, "but we didn't get it done. The Michigan game impacted our 
team last year, but I would be disappointed in the mentality, or mental 
toughness, of our players if after one loss early in the season we cashed it in 
and quit playing football. I prefer not to think that's what happened. However, 
if we had won, it would have made us a more confident team." 
</P>
<P>
Moeller is eager for his first victory as Michigan's coach after serving as an 
assistant to Schembechler for 17 years, a term that was interrupted when 
Moeller coached Illinois coach from 1977 through '79. 
</P>
<P>
Moeller sounded like Schembechler while rehashing the Notre Dame game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to tackle," Moeller said. "That wasn't Michigan defense out there. We 
have to get back to that. A couple of key guys broke down in assignments, which 
really hurt us. We have to get back to that old, fly-around Michigan defense." 
</P>
<P>
As for UCLA, Moeller said: "They came from behind to beat Stanford, and they'll 
come in here on a high note. We have to make sure we take some wind out of 
their sails." 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the Bruins aren't exactly breezing into Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michigan has a 6-2 overall record against UCLA and is 38-15-1 against Pacific 
10 teams, with only USC breaking even, 4-4. . . . The Wolverines used a 
no-huddle, hurry-up offense exclusively against Notre Dame last Saturday night. 
. . . It rained heavily in Ann Arbor Friday. A chance of showers is forecast 
for today. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox said his high school games in Hurst, Tex., 
averaged 11,000 in attendance, and 23,000 watched one playoff game. He will be 
playing before more than 100,000 today. His reaction: "I don't know. I've never 
played before 100,000 before. But once you're on the field, you have to pay so 
much attention to 11 guys on defense that you can't worry about what's going on 
in the stands." . . . While leading UCLA to a 32-31 victory over Stanford in 
the second half, Maddox completed nine consecutive fourth-quarter passes. On 
five second-half possessions with Maddox at quarterback, the Bruins scored 
three touchdowns, got the winning field goal and missed a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp Welborne, Michigan's All-American strong safety, returned a punt 63 yards 
to set up a touchdown in last season's game against UCLA. He returned four 
punts a total of 77 yards against Notre Dame. Bruin Coach Terry Donahue 
indicated that he will instruct punter Courtney Keyler to kick away from 
Welborne -- as he kicked away from Glyn Milburn in the Stanford game. . . . Ken 
Sollom, who participated in a 46-game winning streak while playing for Canyon 
High in Canyon Country, backs up Elvis Grbac at quarterback for the Wolverines.

TROJANS ARE WARY OF SHARK ATTACK IN SEATTLE 
</P>

<P>
Because of its configuration -- cantilevered roofs that extend far out over the 
upper-deck bleachers on either side of the field -- Husky Stadium is known to 
some as "Jaws." 
</P>
<P>
Five times in seven games since 1973, Washington has chewed up USC in Jaws. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in the Pacific 10 Conference opener for both teams, the Huskies will try 
to take another bite. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-10 tie with UCLA last November ended USC's 19-game conference winning 
streak, but the Trojans still haven't lost a conference game since Oct. 10, 
1987, when they were upset by Oregon, 34-27, at Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Under Coach Larry Smith, USC is 21-1-1 against the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Washington is given a good chance to end the Trojans' 20-game conference 
unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
USC was so concerned about this game that it took on an extra game -- last 
month's 34-16 victory over Syracuse at East Rutherford, N.J. -- to give itself 
more time to prepare for the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Have the extra weeks of practice prepared the Trojans? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find out," Smith said. "It's a big, big challenge for us." 
</P>
<P>
Washington, like USC, is 2-0 after beating San Jose State, 20-17, at Seattle 
and Purdue, 20-14, at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"We've struggled," said Washington Coach Don James, whose next victory will be 
the 150th of his collegiate career and his 125th at Washington. "Both games 
could easily have been won by the opponent, but we did some good things in both 
games." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things the Huskies did well was defend. 
</P>
<P>
They lead the Pac-10 in total defense and the nation in rushing defense, having 
allowed 21 rushing yards a game, an average of 0.7 an attempt. Last week, when 
its quarterback was sacked six times for minus-49 yards, Purdue netted zero 
yards in 25 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was expected to be bolstered by the return of inside linebacker 
James Clifford, who missed most of preseason camp and the Huskies' first two 
games because of a knee injury. But Clifford, who led the Pac-10 last season 
with 164 tackles, including 27 in a 24-16 loss to USC at the Coliseum, 
aggravated the injury this week in practice and is not expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Smith said: "They've always been rugged and physical, and now they've 
got the quickness back to where it was when they had those great defenses in 
the mid-'80s." 
</P>
<P>
Washington, though, has given up 269 passing yards a game and ranks only 
seventh in the Pac-10 in passing defense. And, said James, "We've played 
against quarterbacks who are not even close to (USC's) Todd Marinovich." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's concern is not with Marinovich, who has completed 68.1% of his passes 
for 577 yards and four touchdowns, but with the Trojan running game, which has 
averaged 2.7 yards an attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "Let's face it. We're riding the arm of Todd Marinovich and the 
hands of (flanker) Gary Wellman (who has 16 receptions for 230 yards). In the 
first two games, 70% to 80% of our big plays came from those two guys." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but USC has been more potent offensively than the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Operating behind an offensive line that averages 300 pounds from tackle to 
tackle, Washington tailback Greg Lewis leads the Pac-10 in rushing. He ran for 
101 yards against Purdue after running for 157 against San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
But quarterback Mark Brunell, a sophomore from St. Joseph High in Santa Maria 
and the first left-hander to start at quarterback for the Huskies in 16 seasons 
under James, has been erratic, completing 35.3% of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
In his debut, he completed seven of 27 passes for 66 yards against San Jose 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"San Jose State is a blitzing team and they came after us," James said. "And we 
did a poor job of protecting him. When you take the protection breakdowns and 
the poor passes, it equals a pretty long day, and that's what we had." 
</P>
<P>
Brunell was better against Purdue, completing 11 of 24 passes for 150 yards and 
running for 76 yards and a touchdown in 16 carries. His 35-yard pass to Orlando 
McKay with 10:02 left gave the Huskies their game-winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
A sunny day is forecast, with temperatures in the high 70s. . . . A sellout 
crowd of more than 72,000 is expected. 
</P>
<P>
USC has won its last four games against Washington and five of its last six, 
but the Trojans are 14-12-3 in Seattle.

A RAM CASTOFF GETS LAST LAUGH WITH THE STEELERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Evans never made it as a No. 1 draft choice with the Rams and has been 
kicking around pro football ever since. But he persisted, and when he returns 
to Southern California Sunday, it will be as a starter for the Pittsburgh 
Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' top draft pick in 1987 -- he was picked in the second round because 
the club had no first-round choice that year -- Evans lasted one season before 
he was cut. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted as a defensive end out of little-known Winston-Salem State to revive 
the Rams' feeble pass rush, Evans was named a starter by Coach John Robinson 
before signing a contract. 
</P>
<P>
But after missing most of training camp because of a contract dispute, Evans 
came in far behind schedule, then was put on the injured-reserve list because 
of an abdominal injury. 
</P>
<P>
When he was reactivated, Evans, 6-feet-2 and 265 pounds, was told to lose 30 
pounds because he was being shifted to fullback, the position he had played in 
his first three seasons in college. With the Rams, Evans rushed for 10 yards in 
three carries. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1988, the Rams drafted running backs Gaston Green and Robert Delpino, 
and Evans was waived in the last cut before the start of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
He was picked up by the Philadelphia Eagles and played defensive end in the 
nickel defense and on the special teams for five games before suffering a 
broken jaw and being sidelined for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
A Plan B free agent in 1989, Evans re-signed with the Eagles, who promised him 
a raise. But they cut him during training camp, and he was out of football for 
a year, working as a supervisor for a trucking company in Kernersville, N.C., 
his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd like to give it another shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He signed as a defensive end with the Steelers last April and since has 
flourished. So has the Steeler defense. When the Pittsburgh defense takes the 
field against the Raiders at the Coliseum Sunday, it will be as the No. 2 
defense in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
So how does Robinson feel about Evans now? 
</P>
<P>
"We all have failures, all of us," he said. "Players constantly rotate from one 
team to another to find a place to establish themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"He keeps trying. He's a pretty tenacious guy. When he was with us, he didn't 
have the skills necessary to play, but over a period of time he developed some. 
That's great." 
</P>
<P>
Does Evans think the Rams gave him a fair shot? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I was their No. 1 pick. I don't have any resentment against that," Evans 
said. "Things just didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was out there with the Rams, they needed a pass rusher now. I had only 
played 10 games at defensive end until I got drafted by the Rams. I didn't 
really have that much experience as a defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, coming from a small school, the competition level wasn't as high. It was 
a big jump coming from a small school to a pro team. I'd go up against the Ram 
offensive line, and most of them were all-pros." 
</P>
<P>
Evans also said he never had time to concentrate on one position. 
</P>
<P>
"During practice I was working out as a defensive lineman plus running back, 
and I was doing much better at running back," he said. "The Rams were a good 
team, but they were under a lot of pressure. I had to produce and I just 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
But Evans is producing for the Steelers, who are so high on him that they 
traded Tim Johnson, a starting defensive end the last two seasons, to the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Evans has one sack for 10 yards and has made five tackles for a Steeler defense 
that, with 11 sacks for 68 yards, has evoked memories of the old Steel Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh sacked Cleveland's Bernie Kosar seven times in the season opener. 
The Steelers then sacked Houston's Warren Moon four times last week. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having a new job, Evans also has a new look. 
</P>
<P>
With his head shaved and his chin bearded, Evans looks as intimidating as 
former Raider Otis Sistrunk. 
</P>
<P>
But Evans said he didn't get a make-over to look intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
"It was by mistake," Evans said. "My wife was cutting my hair and she went down 
too deep, and I told her to go ahead and cut it all off. Then, a lot of my 
friends said it looked kind of nice, so I've had it cut off ever since." 
</P>
<P>
After being released by the Eagles, Evans said he considered offers from 
Atlanta and Detroit, teams that wanted to sign him as a running back. But he 
signed with the Steelers because he was assured that he could play defensive 
end. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that the key to recruiting him was convincing him that we wouldn't 
bounce him around," said Tom Donahoe, Steeler director of pro personnel and 
development. "He's done extremely well, if you consider that this is the first 
time in his entire career that he's spent an extended period of time at the 
same position." 
</P>
<P>
A longshot to make the team, Evans got more practice time with the first-team 
defense that he normally would have during training camp because rookie Craig 
Veasey and Johnson held out, and Aaron Jones, the club's No. 1 pick two years 
ago, and rookie Kenny Davidson, their No. 2 pick this year, were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an uphill struggle, but each week I got better and better," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Greene, the Steeler Hall of Famer who coaches the defensive line, has made 
Evans his project. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very intelligent man who knows the game and has been real patient with 
me," Evans said. "He knows everything about the position. When Joe Greene 
talks, you listen." 
</P>
<P>
Greene is impressed by Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been waived twice, and he probably feels that this may be his last 
opportunity," Greene said. "People keep asking, 'How can this guy make our team 
and he wasn't able to make the other teams?' You give him something to do and 
allow him to focus on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he would have made it at any of the other positions, given the proper 
amount of time and concentrated effort on that particular position, because one 
thing he does is study. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald is in here sometimes too much. He's in this office watching film when 
I've got to watch it."

<P>
DAVIS CUP: VICTORY OVER SKOFF AT VIENNA COMES AFTER CHANG LOSES TO MUSTER. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city and Munich are not very far apart, only four hours on the Orient 
Express, but Andre Agassi put a lot of distance between himself and his 
embarrassing performance last year in West Germany with a crucial victory 
Friday on the first day of the United States' Davis Cup semifinal competition 
against Austria. 
</P>
<P>
After coming within two points of losing the first set to Horst Skoff, Agassi 
used a powerful kick serve and a driving forehand to dominate the Austrian and 
cruise to a 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never, ever played with anyone who put that kind of pressure on me," 
said the outmatched loser, looking as though he had been run over by the 
aforementioned train that connects Istanbul and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's victory, coming after Michael Chang lost the opening match to Thomas 
Muster, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4, put the United States even in the best-of-five 
matches at 1-1, before today's doubles play. 
</P>
<P>
It also answered a lot of questions about Agassi's "commitment" -- in the 
euphemistic words of U.S. Davis Cup Captain Tom Gorman -- that were posed in 
Munich last year, when Agassi blew what should have been an easy match against 
West Germany's Carl-Uwe Steeb. 
</P>
<P>
That loss, when the Americans already trailed the West Germans, 2-1, sank the 
U.S. chances in the 1989 Davis Cup and reinforced Agassi's reputation as a 
player who does not do well when he or his team is behind. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 20-year-old player from Las Vegas, dressed in skin-tight 
florescent green Spandex shorts and matching jersey, seemed to thrive under the 
pressure of a hostile, whistling crowd of 17,000 at the converted Prater soccer 
stadium on the outskirts of Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Driving Skoff from corner to corner on the rain-dampened clay surface, Agassi 
used his arsenal of looping topspins, inside-out forehands and wicked 
drop-shots to leave the Austrian tied in knots. At the end, Skoff looked like 
one of those blank-faced wooden dolls sold in Austrian airport gift shops. 
Agassi pulled the string and Skoff's arms and legs moved. 
</P>
<P>
Skoff possesses a powerful cross-court forehand and little else. He played 
gamely in the first set, leading Agassi, 6-5, on service. Then with Agassi 
serving, Skoff won the first point and pushed the game to 30-all before Agassi 
hit two big kick serves to force a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Showing impressive composure, Agassi dispatched the Austrian, 7-3, in the 
tiebreaker with an ace on the final point. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped for the best and prepared for the worst," Agassi said in a postmatch 
news conference, for which he wore a T-shirt emblazoned with an American flag. 
"I hoped Michael (Chang) would win, but I was prepared to come out behind, 
1-0." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he has solved his problems with the demands of team competition by 
agreeing to a series of compromises with Gorman. For example, he said he is now 
willing to eat meals with his teammates, Chang and doubles players Rick Leach 
and Jim Pugh, although he much prefers eating with his three regular traveling 
companions -- his coach, his brother and his personal trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as I hate to say it," explained Agassi, as usual saying it anyway, 
"eating dinner with Rick Leach, Jim Pugh and Michael Chang is not going to make 
me play any better." 
</P>
<P>
The other players didn't get a chance to say if Dinner With Andre would help 
their game. Leach and Pugh will represent the United States in doubles today, 
before the second round of singles Sunday, when Agassi will play Muster and 
Chang will go against what remains of Skoff. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon doubles champions Leach and Pugh are slight favorites over the 
Austrian pair of Muster and Alex Antonitsch. However, Austrian Captain Filip 
Krajcik gives his duo a good shot. "Leach and Pugh are not that good on clay," 
Krajcik said, "I think it is going to be a very good match and difficult for 
the States." 
</P>
<P>
As for Chang, the 18-year-old player from Placentia was simply put under too 
much pressure by Muster, a specialist on clay, and pushed into making an 
uncharacteristic 56 unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
Chang conceded that Muster "was able to dictate more of the points and keep me 
playing defensive tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Muster, who extended his Davis Court record to 23-0 on clay, said he was glad 
to play Chang in front of a hometown audience. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, he said, crowds almost always favor the boyish, 143-pound 
Chang because "he looks so tiny and skinny and poor."

NEWSWIRE: MCKEON FIRED AS GENERAL MANAGER OF PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack McKeon was fired as general manager by the San Diego Padres on Friday, 
ending a decade-long stay with the club. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' new ownership group, which bought the team from Joan Kroc in June, 
announced the firing after a day-long meeting. 
</P>
<P>
While stripped of his general manager's duties, McKeon, 59, apparently will 
allowed to stay with the club in some capacity. He is under contract through 
1991 at $400,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have already begun interviewing candidates for McKeon's job, and

Just one day before the 16-day Games were scheduled to open, police searched 
pedestrians at random. Travelers in and out of the main train station had to 
pass through metal detectors as security officers X-rayed their luggage.

Guard David Wingate of the San Antonio Spurs, accused in two alleged rapes, 
won't be part of the team when the NBA exhibition season opens next month, 
owner Red McCombs said. 
</P>
<P>
Wingate, 26, was indicted Thursday in Howard County in Maryland in the alleged 
rape Sunday of a 17-year-old girl. He was charged with second-degree rape, 
assault and battery and third-degree sexual offense. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a 21-year old San Antonio woman filed a civil suit against 
Wingate claiming he raped her in June. The suit alleges two of Wingate's 
friends also assaulted the woman at his house.

CARNEY SIGNED FOR INSURANCE AT KICKER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As expected, free-agent kicker John Carney signed with the Rams Friday as 
insurance for Mike Lansford's sore right leg, and probably will handle the 
kickoffs Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford, who will do the placekicking, said he could probably also kick off, 
but the Rams feared that he might further damage his right calf muscle during 
the game, leaving the team without a placekicker. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Carney, the Rams placed tight end Richard Ashe on the injured 
reserve list with a stress fracture of the left foot. 
</P>
<P>
Carney said that despite the uncertainty of the situation and knowing he could 
be waived as soon as Lansford feels 100%, he was happy to get the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity to be with the Rams, kick in pregame, and if they need me 
to do kickoffs or whatnot, I'll do that," Carney said. 
</P>
<P>
Carney will wear No. 18, once worn by Roman Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
An interesting situation is developing for the Eagles at guard. They acquired 
former San Francisco 49ers starter Bruce Collie off waivers before the season 
started, and he is already beginning to push starting right guard Ron Solt out 
of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Solt, obtained by the Eagles from Indianapolis for Nos. 1 and 4 draft choices 
in 1988, has been a marginal player at best when physically sound -- he has had 
several knee injuries -- or not on suspension -- he was banned for four weeks 
last season after testing positive for steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a frustration for a team that hoped he would clean out running 
lanes. So far this season, the Eagles have the 18th-rated running offense in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, it was Collie, not Solt, who was in the game for the last series 
of the Eagles' 23-21 loss to the Phoenix Cardinals. Solt grumbled about it, and 
Ryan said he expects Collie to play more against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' No. 1 draft pick in 1986, Mike Schad, is the Eagles' starting left 
guard, and Ryan has called him the team's best guard. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear who Jim Everett favors in the Rams' revolving three-tailback 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson maintains that he will play Curt Warner, Gaston Green 
and Cleveland Gary equally this week, and has not said who will start. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt we're in a position where we desperately need to get a 
running game going," Everett said. "It will come. I'm not a prophet, but 
Cleveland Gary is starting to make a run at the tailback position. Me being his 
peer, that's what I see." TIM KAWAKAMI

Al Davis and Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Chuck Noll were assistant coaches with 
the San Diego Chargers in 1960-62. Noll said Friday that although he and Davis 
remain friends, he hadn't spoken with the Raider owner recently. 
</P>
<P>
How does Noll remember the Raider-Steeler rivalry of the 1970s? "They were 
very, very physical," he said. "I don't expect this one (Sunday at the 
Coliseum) to be any less." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Walton, fired as coach of the New York Jets at the end of last season, was 
hired as the Steelers' offensive coordinator to revamp the offense, which 
ranked last in the NFL last season. But the Steelers have struggled this 
season, failing to score an offensive touchdown in two games. 
</P>

"Until we quit making mistakes, it wouldn't matter if we were playing the 
YMCA," quarterback Bubby Brister said. CHRIS BAKER

With its Big West opener at Fresno State only a week away, Cal State Fullerton 
expects to find out today how it will stack up in conference play when it takes

<P>
Titan Coach Gene Murphy considers Akron, a Division I-A independent, on a par 
with the top Big West teams. 
</P>
<P>
Akron is 2-0-1, but Coach Gerry Faust is quick to point out that victories over 
Illinois State, 17-7, and Kent, 38-10, and a 14-14 tie with Central Michigan 
are not especially remarkable. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

WINLESS LONG BEACH PLAYS HOST TO PACIFIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Allen, still winless in his return as a college football coach, tries 
again today at 1 p.m. when Cal State Long Beach plays University of the Pacific 
in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Big West Conference game will be the home opener for the 49ers, who are 0-3 
overall and 0-1 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, which lost last week to San Diego State, 38-20, has committed 10 
turnovers and given up an average of 41 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think each game we're getting better," Allen said. "We just have to 
eliminate all these mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The 49er offense has relied on quarterback Todd Studer and wide receiver Mark 
Seay. Of Studer's 35 successful passes, 14 have been caught by Seay for 199 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific (1-2, 0-1) also is pass-oriented. In a 28-14 loss last week to San Jose 
State, the Tigers were thrown for minus-one yard rushing, but quarterback Kris 
King passed for 282 yards. DICK WAGNER

Between shows, the black vaudeville entertainers at the Morton Theater left 
brief messages to the future on the dressing room walls. 
</P>
<P>
In 1919, Bob White used chalk to record the engagement of his minstrel group, 
the Dark Town Swells. Another graffito, scribbled in pencil, announces to 
posterity: "Joe Johnson's 1931 Black Babies here June 8. Played 6 nights." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the entertainers would later fade into obscurity. The Morton began to 
fade with them, a relic not only of a passing entertainment but also a painful 
era of segregation. It closed in the 1950s and rapidly deteriorated. Few seemed 
to care. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the graffiti and the theater have new life. In one of dozens of 
restoration efforts under way in black neighborhoods across the country, 
architects have been hired to shore up the Morton's roof and to restore its 
dilapidated interior. In 1992, the theater will reopen as a cultural center and 
museum paying tribute to the vaudeville performers. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, people said it was a crazy idea," Linny Bailey, a 30-year-old 
attorney, recalled as he stood on the cobweb-covered stage. "But, when the 
scaffolding went up outside and the work got going, they finally started to 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
From New York's Harlem to rural towns like Athens, historic preservation has 
found a new and growing constituency among middle-class blacks. They are the 
bankers, lawyers, city officials and others who care deeply for the simple 
wood-frame houses, the inner-city jazz clubs and the one-room schoolhouses of 
their racially segregated past. 
</P>
<P>
Even a partial list of the places where black preservationists are now working 
reads like a primer of black American history: 
</P>
<P>
In August, activists in New York won a fight to prevent the destruction of the 
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem, site of the 1965 assassination of Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pleasant Hill community of Macon, Ga., preservationists are working to 
save the childhood home of rock 'n' roll pioneer Little Richard. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Los Angeles activists officially reopened the restored 
Dunbar Hotel, a Central Avenue landmark patronized by W.E.B. Du Bois, Duke 
Ellington and other black intellectuals and artists. 
</P>
<P>
The Topeka, Kan., elementary school that figured in Brown vs. the Board of 
Education, the 1954 Supreme Court school desegregation case, was named to the 
National Registry of Historic Places last year. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the growing movement, the National Park Service and several 
states -- including Georgia, Alabama and New York -- have begun efforts to 
identify more sites in black communities that can be named to national and 
state registries of historic places. 
</P>
<P>
The preservationists say their work is guided by a growing sense of urgency. 
Already, countless buildings have been lost because they are in inner-city 
communities under siege for decades by the ravages of urban decay. 
</P>
<P>
Slumlords have allowed once-elegant apartment buildings to fall into disrepair. 
Waves of heroin addicts have converted older buildings into "shooting 
galleries." In the 1960s, urban renewal projects bulldozed entire 
neighborhoods, then were often followed by the contemporary plagues of 
homelessness and crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Many preservationists say their efforts are important because black Americans 
must draw on the lessons of their history if they are to overcome the crises of 
unemployment and substance abuse that torment many communities across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't understand the history of the civil rights movement, we won't be 
able to understand the barriers that we continue to face," said D'Army Bailey, 
48, a Memphis, Tenn., attorney who has led the effort to preserve the Lorraine 
Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building a Memorial 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the motel was a seedy eyesore, its rooms rented to prostitutes. 
At one time, it was slated for destruction. Then, in 1986, Bailey and a group 
of black businessmen began to lobby state and local officials to support a 
$10-million preservation project. 
</P>
<P>
The motel is scheduled to open as a memorial to King in July, 1991, along with 
an adjacent museum honoring civil rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
"The fuel for our movement of the future lies in what that motel represents," 
Bailey said. "Telling the story of the Lorraine Motel and the struggle it 
symbolizes is an effort to keep alive that spirit of sacrifice, struggle and 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
In several cities, the landmarks date from the 1920s Harlem Renaissance, an era 
that saw the creation of vibrant inner-city commercial strips not only on Lenox 
Avenue in New York but on streets such as Auburn Avenue in Atlanta and Central 
Avenue in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The new-found interest in the landmarks may point to a growing angst among 
middle-class blacks who long ago left the downtown neighborhoods for racially 
integrated suburbs, said Lonnie Bunch, a historian at the Smithsonian 
Institution who worked on the preservation of the Dunbar Hotel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"These (inner-city) communities (were) the homes of most black people in the 
'40s and '50s," Bunch said. "They never thought of them in the historical 
sense. In the '60s, they moved to the suburbs. Now, they're feeling isolated 
and disconnected from their past. This is the first generation of 
African-Americans that isn't connected to the network of a downtown community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disintegration' Seen 
</P>
<P>
Isolated from white society, central-city neighborhoods like Denver's Five 
Points and Detroit's Black Bottom were places where the working poor lived side 
by side with black lawyers and doctors. Barbers, haberdashers and other 
merchants catered to a growing clientele of migrants from the rural South. 
</P>
<P>
Community self-sufficiency was then the principal survival strategy for a 
people faced with widespread prejudice and segregation practices. Now, some 
black preservationists believe blacks have paid an unexpected price for the 
victories of the civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't call it integration, I call it disintegration," said Jeanne Lanier 
Rudd, manager of the Charlotte Hawkins Brown Memorial Historic Site in Sedalia, 
N.C., just west of Greensboro. "We lost the caring attitude of the teachers 
when we integrated. You became a number." 
</P>
<P>
Once an elite prep school for black children, the historic site is named for 
the educator who founded the school in 1902. Although its renovation is not yet 
complete, the school was added to North Carolina's registry of historic places 
in 1987, the first in the state to honor a black American. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, state officials dedicated a historic preservation district this 
month in Conant Gardens, a relatively affluent community of black homeowners 
established in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our young people in Detroit believe black history begins when Coleman 
Young became mayor (in 1974)," said Janese Chapman, 32, a city specialist in 
historic preservation. "They didn't know about anything that came before. That 
scared me . . . . If you don't pique their interest, a lot of this stuff will 
be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, black Detroit's entertainment district, Paradise Valley, was almost 
completely obliterated in the mid-1960s by the construction of the Chrysler 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"When those things were demolished to make way for better things, we also lost 
a way of life," Chapman said. "Paradise Valley was more than just businesses. 
It was people taking care of people. They made sure no black people went hungry 
in the city of Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
Historic preservation can also have very practical benefits. Touring the 
landmarks of black America has become a growing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Magazines such as Ebony and Black Enterprise periodically publish tour guides 
of the historic sites of the South and Northeast. This year, more than 1 
million people will visit the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic Site in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
New York City has established a Marcus Garvey Walking Tour -- brass plaques 
mark important sites in the life of the founder of nation's first black 
nationalist movement. And at least four separate touring companies compete to 
take busloads of mostly European and Japanese sightseers to Harlem landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
One company offers a "Champagne Jazz Safari" of Harlem's nightclubs. 
Unfortunately, many of the famous Harlem clubs of the big-band era have been 
destroyed, including the Cotton Club and the Savoy Theater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ballroom Saved 
</P>
<P>
Old buildings fall in Harlem with predictable regularity. Yet another Harlem 
landmark, the Audubon Ballroom, was scheduled for destruction earlier this 
year. Columbia University, owner of the property, had slated the site for a 
biological research laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
A broad coalition of black community groups opposed the project, however, 
calling it an affront to the memory of Malcolm X. The militant revolutionary 
was killed at the ballroom when addressing a group of followers on Feb. 21, 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
"Malcolm X is emerging as such a gigantic figure in African-American life," 
said Michael Adams, a Columbia graduate student who helped to lead the effort 
to save the Audubon. "And here you have this great cultural landmark associated 
with his memory. We couldn't understand why they were so willing to see it 
swept aside." 
</P>
<P>
The university finally agreed in August to preserve most of the building and to 
create a memorial to the slain activist. 
</P>
<P>
Heartened by the success, Adams helped to establish the Upper Manhattan Society 
for Progress Through Preservation. The group aims to save those landmarks still 
standing amid the burned-out shells of tenement buildings that line many Harlem 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Harlem is a leader in the nationwide black preservation movement; 
four Harlem neighborhoods are designated as historic districts. Attracted by 
the renovated 19th-Century homes and the pleasant, tree-lined streets, several 
middle-class blacks have moved into the Harlem neighborhoods, including a few 
high-ranking members of the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
Still, countless other important Harlem landmarks are not protected by 
historic-district status. Adams said his group would like to protect the 
fashionable apartment buildings on Edgecomb Avenue in the Sugar Hill district. 
High on a bluff overlooking the East River and the Bronx, Sugar Hill epitomized 
the style and grace of New York's black elite. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was historic status granted to the Lafayette Theater, a key venue in the 
development of the 1920s Harlem jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
While walking through Harlem with a visitor on one recent afternoon, Adams 
nearly wept when he discovered workmen using jackhammers to blast apart the 
Lafayette's 80-year-old terra cotta facade. The workers, he said, had 
effectively ruined the theater's historic character. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my God, they've started the destruction!" Adams cried out as he approached 
the building. Reaching into a trash bin, he picked up pieces of the facade 
already discarded by the workers. "All of this beautiful terra cotta 
ornamentation . . . as if it were so much garbage." 
</P>
<P>
The theater, Adams explained, had for years been home to a black church. A 
recently appointed minister had decided to replace the old facade and its 
cornices with an austere, modern-looking exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said he has had similar experiences with other Harlem residents who do 
not share his passion for historic preservation. Many believe "new is better 
than old," he said. Others equate historic preservation with gentrification, in 
which white buyers snap up properties in neighborhoods that appear to be ripe 
for renovation and higher property values. 
</P>
<P>
Partly to address these and other concerns, preservationists in Macon, Ga., 
have developed an original plan to combine historic restoration with a program 
to provide decent housing for Macon's disadvantaged residents. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Hill, the heart of Macon's black community, was declared a national 
historic district in 1986. The designation qualifies homes in the area for 
historic rehabilitation tax credits. Together with federal low-income housing 
grants, the tax credits have made possible the restoration of more than a dozen 
tumbledown houses. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to preserve just monuments," said Maryel Battin of the Macon 
Heritage Foundation. "The more critical need is to preserve Pleasant Hill as a 
community and to upgrade its housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation recently helped rehabilitate a row of "shotgun" houses -- frame 
buildings with front and back doors coincidentally aligned so that it is 
possible to fire a shot straight through without hitting a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the shotgun houses were originally built on alleys behind the homes of 
affluent whites as living quarters for their servants. Later, they became 
standard housing throughout Pleasant Hill. Several have since burned down. But 
still standing, among the vacant lots, is the childhood home of Little Richard, 
the flamboyant "architect of rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
Publicity surrounding the proposed restoration of Little Richard's home, along 
with others in the community, has already inspired several Pleasant Hill 
residents to begin fixing up their homes, said Howard L. Scott, director of the 
Booker T. Washington Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the guy who has no money, but who does have a hammer, get excited 
about his place," Scott said. "People are learning about the richness of Macon 
history. Once that happens, people are going to feel better about themselves 
because they're from Macon. It gives us hope for the rebirth of our community."

GORBACHEV SEEKS SWEEPING POWERS TO SAVE HIS REFORMS

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday sought sweeping emergency 
powers to save his reforms as the nation's lawmakers, leery of provoking 
large-scale unemployment and unrest, balked at approving a plan for rapid 
transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reached the stage where we can't step aside," a visibly exasperated 
Gorbachev declared after it became obvious that the divided Supreme Soviet, or 
legislature, which lacked a quorum at the critical moment, could not make a 
decision. "Grant me such powers, and we will act." 
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected move to take over some of the powers of the Supreme Soviet, 
now only in its second year as the country's functioning legislature, Gorbachev 
asked for the right to issue decrees on a broad range of economic and social 
issues that ordinarily are matters for the lawmakers to decide, including 
property rights, economic management, salaries, prices, the state budget and 
the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
Now prey to ethnic upheavals and growing economic disorders, the Soviet Union 
is beset with a "crisis of executive power" and more resolute action is needed 
to deal with the national "emergency," Gorbachev argued, striking the wooden 
lectern in the Kremlin hall with his hand for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"The processes have become so overwhelming that they could run out of control, 
and already are doing so in certain sectors," he warned lawmakers. "This could 
cause great damage and even destroy perestroika," he said, referring to his 
campaign for economic and social restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"In some places, we may have to introduce and implement presidential rule and 
end the activity of all institutions, including elected ones," Gorbachev said, 
evoking the possibility that he might impose direct rule to stem ethnic turmoil 
in the Transcaucasus or independence movements in the Baltic republics. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Gorbachev was elected to a new, more powerful executive 
presidency that was tailor-made for him. Some lawmakers on Friday opposed his 
request for still greater powers -- in essence to be allowed to amend or 
override existing laws if needed, subject to ultimate Supreme Soviet approval 
-- as too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
One legislator objected that Gorbachev's request "practically reduces the power 
of the Supreme Soviet to zero." But the president dismissed the arguments of 
legalistic "nightingales of jurisprudence," as he called them. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of speakers, citing the crisis in their nation, endorsed his 
request. 
</P>
<P>
"The country is breaking up; the country is in chaos," one woman deputy said 
from the floor. "Today, I would collect all the powers in the world and give 
them to Mikhail Sergeyevich (Gorbachev) if I could." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such a keen sense of urgency, the lack of a quorum on a chaotic day in 
the 542-member Supreme Soviet delayed consideration of Gorbachev's special 
powers request until Monday, when the legislature reconvenes. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 days of study and debate, the lawmakers also failed to opt definitely 
for a radical reform plan based on recommendations from economist Stanislav S. 
Shatalin, a Gorbachev protege, or the more gradual package drawn up by the 
country's prime minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
In what is arguably his greatest gamble since he became Soviet leader in 1985, 
Gorbachev by and large has endorsed the Shatalin plan, which would doom 
traditional state socialism by a large-scale privatization of government assets 
and deregulation of prices for up to 80% of consumer goods and services by the 
end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the Supreme Soviet devoted what was supposed to be its last day to 
considering Shatalin's "500-day" economic rescue plan, speaker after speaker 
took the podium to voice hostility or doubts over its effects, or damned it 
with faint praise by saying that it should be gutted to include features of 
Ryzhkov's program. 
</P>
<P>
Apocalyptic forecasts were made of what the switch to a supply-and-demand 
economy would produce after decades of the "administrative-command system." 
</P>
<P>
Gaibnazar P. Pallaev of Tadzhikistan warned that Shatalin's program would throw 
45% of the working population out of their jobs in his Central Asian republic. 
V. A. Valov predicted that the plan would cut the nation's industrial output, 
already sinking, by a staggering 40% to 50% next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet session had been widely expected to determine Ryzhkov's 
political fate by approving either his plan, which retains government control 
over much of the economy, or Shatalin's. The previous day, the legislature of 
the Russian republic, presided over by radical populist Boris N. Yeltsin, 
turned up the pressure on Ryzhkov by demanding that he resign. 
</P>
<P>
If Shatalin's plan is approved, Ryzhkov has indicated that he will step down. 
In what seemed like an 11th-hour bid to keep his job, the 60-year-old prime 
minister asked the legislators to compromise by merging his plan and Shatalin's 
to come up with a single document before Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, however, made it clear that although the document finally adopted 
could include "some provisions from the government's program," it should be 
based on the faster-track approach proposed by Shatalin. 
</P>
<P>
One lawmaker, demanding Ryzhkov's resignation, questioned his ability to 
implement someone else's plan. But Gorbachev said he was not prepared to seek 
the departure of Ryzhkov, a loyal ally from the onset of the perestroika 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"If we start reshuffling at this historic time, when we have important things 
to do, this will be a gift to the pretenders (to power)," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary paralysis, however, left Ryzhkov in the saddle, at least until 
the Supreme Soviet reconvenes on Monday. A bill that would have confirmed the 
Shatalin approach as the "basis" for a reworked final draft could not be voted 
on after the Parliament's normally unflappable speaker, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, 
noted testily that the necessary two-thirds of the deputies had not returned 
from lunch, and that there was thus no quorum. 
</P>
<P>
Lukyanov hinted that a plot was afoot to delay a decision on the economic plan, 
but independent Marxist historian Roy A. Medvedev objected that such reasoning 
was far-fetched. In the 1 1/2 years that the Supreme Soviet has functioned, 
Medvedev reminded Lukyanov, there has never been a quorum on a Friday 
afternoon, when many deputies leave Moscow to spend the weekend in their 
constituencies.

IRAQ EXPELS 3 U.S. DIPLOMATS, EUROPE ENVOYS

<P>
In a further escalation of tension in the Persian Gulf crisis, Iraq ordered the 
expulsion Friday of three U.S. diplomats and the military attaches of 11 
Western European nations. 
</P>
<P>
The United States promptly responded by announcing that three diplomats at the 
Iraqi Embassy in Washington, including the military attache, must leave. All 
the envoys ordered out of both Baghdad and Washington were given a week to get 
their affairs in order. 
</P>
<P>
"This action comes as a result of the Iraqi government's expulsion of our 
embassy's defense attache and two other diplomatic officers," State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The mounting battle of diplomatic expulsions came on a day when a tough message 
from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein warned his people to prepare for war 
against the "dwarfs and small people" aligned against him. He vowed there will 
be no retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Europe said their military specialists and other embassy personnel 
had been ordered out of Iraq in apparent retaliation for the European 
Community's decision Monday to expel Iraqi diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 EC member countries, only Portugal said it had not received an 
expulsion order from the Iraqi authorities. Portugal has no military attache at 
its Baghdad embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of European diplomats being expelled was not clear, but it 
appeared that several envoys from each nation would be affected. Officials in 
Cairo said the Egyptian military attache also had been told to leave Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"The expulsion is a reaction to what we did to them," British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd said at a news conference in London. "I am keen that the rest of 
the (embassy) staff in Baghdad should be able to carry on with their job 
helping the British community." 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jock Covey phoned Iraqi 
Ambassador Mohammed Mashat to protest the expulsions in Baghdad and to inform 
him that Iraq must now make similar cuts in its own staff. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 27, the United States told Iraq to reduce its embassy staff of 55 to 
19. A few days later, Iraq also restricted the number of American diplomats in 
Baghdad to 19. 
</P>
<P>
The current round of expulsions began after Iraqi troops in Kuwait forced their 
way into the diplomatic compounds of France, Canada and Belgium last week and 
detained diplomatic personnel who had stayed on in defiance of an Iraqi order 
to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The French military attache was detained for several hours, and in response, 
French President Francois Mitterrand ordered Iraqi diplomats out of France and 
sent more French troops to Saudi Arabia to join the multinational force 
deployed after Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The European Community governments acted immediately after Mitterrand's move. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, meanwhile, the government announced Friday that it will expel newly 
enrolled Iraqi students at British schools, intensifying the European freeze on 
official exchanges with the Hussein government. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hussein remained defiant. In a statement broadcast early Friday 
on Baghdad television, the ruling Revolutionary Command Council appeared to be 
preparing the Iraqi people for war. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a single chance for any retreat . . . from waging the battle 
according to principles of honor and deep faith and determination to achieve 
victory," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by footage of a grim, uniformed Hussein presiding over Thursday's 
council meeting, the statement said that "God wants Iraq to wage battle on 
Iraqi soil for the liberation of Jerusalem and the holy shrines" of Mecca and 
Medina in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
God, it went on, is behind the Iraqi cause against Washington and its allies in 
Cairo and Riyadh. "They have reached in their meanness to a degree where they 
cut off from the great people its supply of food and medicine, and from the 
children their milk," said the statement, referring to the U.N.-sponsored trade 
embargo against Iraq. "Oh, what dwarfs and small people they are." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jasim told a Turkish newsman that Baghdad 
seeks a drawn-out conflict -- two years or more in duration -- and that the 
all-out air war favored by Western military strategists "wouldn't be in Iraq's 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad asserted Friday that two unidentified planes flying from Saudi Arabia 
had violated its airspace by as much as six miles before turning back. It was 
the third such complaint since the gulf crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military spokesman said that no American aircraft had violated Iraqi 
airspace, while Saudi authorities had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed news reports that Saudi Arabia had shut off 
oil supplies to Jordan, where pro-Iraq sentiment runs high among the populace. 
</P>
<P>
The Mideast Mirror, a London publication, quoted an unidentified Jordanian 
official as saying the pipeline to Jordan's Zarqa refinery had been shut down 
Thursday. There was no immediate confirmation from Saudi Arabia, which had 
agreed to supply Jordan with oil if it reduces its imports of Iraqi crude. 
Before the invasion of Kuwait, Jordan received 90% of its oil from Iraq, 
reportedly at discount prices. 
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Jordanian official as saying the Saudis had closed the 
pipeline because Amman failed to pay its bill, which he estimated at $48 
million. It said the Saudi action was intended to punish Jordan for not taking 
a hard line against Iraq.

U.S. TO SCALE BACK WEAPONS PACKAGE FOR SAUDI ARABIA; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: A $22-BILLION ARMS SALE WILL BE SPLIT INTO TWO SMALLER PROPOSALS. 
THE MOVE IS MEANT TO ALLAY CONCERNS ABOUT UPSETTING THE MIDEAST'S BALANCE OF 
POWER.

<TEXT>
<P>
The White House, responding to congressional concerns about a new Middle East 
arms race in the making, agreed Friday to scale back a proposed emergency sale 
of planes, tanks and other sophisticated military hardware to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of submitting to Congress a single arms deal totaling as much as $22 
billion, the Bush Administration intends to seek immediate approval of a 
smaller package including only those weapons urgently needed by the Saudi 
government to counter possible Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the package, expected to consist of fighter jets, tanks and 
other weaponry that would be delivered over a period of years, will be referred 
to lawmakers in a second proposal sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The specific items to be provided in the first phase are still being 
determined and will encompass equipment and training requiring early 
(congressional) action," the White House said in a statement. "This request 
will be sent to the Congress early next week." 
</P>
<P>
The decision represents a significant concession by the Administration to 
mounting concerns within Congress about the potential impact of a massive Saudi 
arms sale on the balance of power in the Middle East. A number of lawmakers, 
meeting with Administration officials in closed-door sessions, had proposed 
dividing the package into two pieces. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing its intention to submit the Saudi arms sale proposal in two 
phases, the White House gave no indication of the size of each portion or the 
value of the combined package. Administration officials have said that the 
original proposal advanced by the Pentagon called for the sale of $18 billion 
to $22 billion in arms. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its willingess to accommodate lawmakers' desire to consider the Saudis' 
short-term and long-term weapons needs in separate installments, the White 
House made clear that it will continue to press for approval of the entire arms 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"In both cases, we believe that it is essential that the United States be able 
and willing to provide the Saudi Arabian armed forces with the weapons and 
training it needs to deter and defend itself against aggression," the White 
House statement said. "Such support constitutes a key dimension of our overall 
strategy toward the Persian Gulf and could serve as well to protect American 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the crisis in the Persian Gulf moving into its eighth week, 
U.S. officials said they see no sign that international pressure has weakened 
Saddam Hussein's determination to hold onto Kuwait. Administration officials 
braced members of Congress to prepare for a protracted siege. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions remain our strategy for resolving this crisis" and they "are going 
to take some time to work," President Bush said at a brief news conference held 
before he left Washington for a weekend at his Camp David, Md., retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Bush declined to rule out an American first strike against Iraq, citing the 
treatment of U.S. hostages and the possibility of Iraqi-sponsored terrorism as 
among the "universally heralded markers" that could bring a U.S. military 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold Saddam Hussein responsible if there is any terrorist act against us," 
Bush said. But, he quickly added, he does "not want to send . . . (a) signal 
that I'm shifting more toward" a military response. 
</P>
<P>
Said one White House official, "The feeling around here is we are still a long 
way from war." But, he added, despite extensive intelligence about the 
situation in the Middle East, Administration officials remain stymied in trying 
to guess what Hussein will do next. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David L. Boren 
(D-Okla.) echoed that concern. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real worry as to whether anybody around (Hussein) has the capability 
of . . . delivering the bad news," to him, Boren said. "We just don't see any 
signs at this point that he's listening." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, U.S. allies in the Middle East who are pressing for 
a quick military solution to the crisis are "underestimating our staying 
power." With the U.S.-led effort continuing to receive extensive international 
support, the Administration seems prepared for a long-term campaign of economic 
sanctions against Iraq, he added. 
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Bush denied reports that Iraq had begun sending loaded 
oil tankers to Iran in an attempt to evade the international economic blockade. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some leakage in terms of food across the border, but generally 
speaking, it looks like Iran is doing what Iran has represented . . . to a lot 
of countries that they would do, and that is to apply the sanctions," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials repeatedly have said Iran could become a major loophole in the 
sanctions network if the Tehran government decides to aid Iraq. So far, 
however, there is no clear sign that the Iranians have decided to do so, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
With diplomacy still the order of the day, the Administration plans another 
round of meetings next week with key international leaders to keep the 
anti-Iraq coalition together. 
</P>
<P>
One key step is likely to be a vote by the U.N. Security Council to expand the 
current blockade of Iraqi commerce to cover airplanes. The U.N. Security 
Council on Friday ended a week of backstage wrangling over imposing an air 
embargo on Iraq by deciding to put the matter off until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov, the council president, said he will 
convene the 15 members "with the understanding" that the meeting will be 
presided over by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that a majority of the 15 members will be represented at the 
foreign minister level. The last time foreign ministers attended a Security 
Council meeting was on Sept. 26, 1985, for a ceremonial session commemorating 
the United Nations' 40th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said Secretary James A. Baker III can be expected to 
attend Tuesday, along with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain and 
Foreign Ministers Roland Dumas of France and Qian Qichen of China. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, meanwhile, plans to meet Tuesday with Turkish President Turgut Ozal. 
Turkey is one of the most important countries in the sanctions effort because 
it controls one of Iraq's two oil export pipelines and because its long border 
with Iraq could become an important route for smuggling of food and other goods 
into Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has spoken repeatedly with Ozal since the crisis began and has promised 
considerable aid to the Turks to cushion the economic losses the country is 
incurring by cutting off Iraq's oil flow. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the week, Bush will travel to New York, where he will give a speech to 
the United Nations. While there, he plans to meet with Shevardnadze and 
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Shevardnadze is expected to focus both on the gulf situation 
and the remaining hurdles blocking progress on arms limitation treaties.

SYRIA'S ASSAD TAKES A RISKY STAND IN SIDING WITH WEST;

<P>
STRATEGY: HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF BREACHING ARAB PROTOCOL BY SENDING TROOPS TO

DAMASCUS, Syria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Hafez Assad, the lone gun of Middle East politics, has joined the 
posse, sending Syrian troops to Saudi Arabia for the showdown with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In the shifting alliances of the Arab world, the 60-year-old Assad, two decades 
in power here, had remained obdurate and aloof. Diplomats called him "Mr. No." 
He was the man who sat and waited for things to turn his way. 
</P>
<P>
Now, faced with hard and complex new realities, he has taken a stand, one that 
is rife with risk. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has accused him of siding with Western powers, a 
breach of Arab protocol. And many Syrians are tuned to Baghdad Radio. There is 
grumbling in the army. Fundamentally, Kuwaitis, Saudis and the oil-rich sheiks 
of the Persian Gulf are not Assad's kind of people. 
</P>
<P>
But Assad, as always, is keeping his eye on Arab interests as he sees them, and 
those of his own regime. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he says, is an 
unacceptable threat. 
</P>
<P>
With the perennial outsider in the thick of the confrontation, the regional 
lineup has changed radically. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything heightens more the isolation of Saddam Hussein in the 
Arab world than Syrian involvement," Secretary of State James A. Baker III told 
a news conference in Brussels on the way to his Sept. 14 talks with Assad. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining his motivations to his own people, Assad declared in a long, 
nationally televised speech two days before Baker arrived: 
</P>
<P>
"Can we say that the invasion and annexation has placed the Arab nation in a 
stronger position? . . . Did it unite our ranks? . . . Did it benefit Iraq, or 
has it, once again, wasted Iraq's potential and placed Iraq in a position 
foretelling grave harm? The invasion of Kuwait and the canceling of a state is 
a great catastrophe, an unforgiveable sin." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say there is more to the Syrian stance than Assad's long-held 
personal antipathy toward Hussein and fears that his old rival might end up 
calling the shots in the Middle East. The region has been rattled by a series 
of events over the past decade: the Iran-Iraq War, the Palestinian rebellion in 
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza; the interminable strife in Lebanon, 
and the collapse of the Soviet empire. 
</P>
<P>
None has affected Syria more than the last. Syria was the premier Soviet client 
in the Middle East, and Assad milked the connection rigorously. With his Soviet 
arms, only the Israelis dared to stand up to him. Now he has seen the writing 
on the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
A European diplomat here said: "Moscow had put Assad on notice two years ago 
that it would no longer pay the bill to make Syria a regional military 
colossus. But what shook them was the fall of the East German and Romanian 
regimes. They got the message. They had to change their style." 
</P>
<P>
Assad has moved to open up the state-run economy, and he has dipped a toe into 
Arab diplomacy, re-establishing relations with U.S.-bankrolled Egypt, which had 
been shunned from his tent for a decade for its separate peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Assad can see what's going on with the Soviets and Eastern Europe," another 
diplomat said. "He has to put his eggs in another basket, in this case with the 
Arabs." 
</P>
<P>
Syria had remained an outsider as Arab blocs were forming in the wake of the 
Iran-Iraq War. Saddam Hussein engineered the Arab Cooperation Council -- Iraq, 
Egypt, Jordan and Yemen -- as a counterweight to the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation 
Council and as a personal vehicle for Arab leadership. The North African Arab 
states formed their own union. 
</P>
<P>
Damascus was the odd capital out. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Arab Cooperation Council is a shambles, and the prospect of an ad hoc 
Syrian, Egyptian, Saudi axis is rising in opposition to Iraqi power. Each 
brings its own special power and influence. 
</P>
<P>
There is a Middle Eastern adage, attributed to former Secretary of State Henry 
A. Kissinger, which holds that "you can't make war without Egypt and you can't 
make peace without Syria." It could be amended to add that nothing moves in the 
Middle East without the oil of Saudi money. According to Damascus-based 
diplomats, it is flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that the Saudis will be meeting the payroll of the Syrian 
troops," one diplomat said, "and putting in something government-to-government 
as well. We're talking megabucks." 
</P>
<P>
The unconfirmed word here is that the Saudis will bolster the Syrian treasury 
to the tune of $2 billion, in addition to the billions promised Egypt, Turkey 
and Jordan for their crisis-damaged economies. 
</P>
<P>
Assad has reportedly promised to send another 15,000 to 20,000 troops to Saudi 
Arabia, joining the 4,000 already there. Among the units to be sent, diplomats 
said, is the 9th Armored Division, which will be pulled off the Golan Heights 
front with Israel, another sign of the changing times. 
</P>
<P>
The moves are being handled carefully by the Assad regime. When the decision 
was made at an Arab League summit conference in Cairo to send troops to the 
gulf region, Assad convened the National Progressive Front, the loose coalition 
of leftist, secular parties that backs the ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party. 
The political doctrine was laid down and disseminated through Baathist and 
administration channels. 
</P>
<P>
While reports of pro-Iraqi demonstrations in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi 
border, have been denied by diplomats and reporters who went to the areas, 
Assad's decision to defend the Saudis and demand an Iraqi withdrawal from 
Kuwait was hardly universally popular here. Iraq's denunciation of oil-rich 
gulf sheiks and foreign troops in the Islamic heartland has struck a chord, 
diplomats say. 
</P>
<P>
Amad Bagdadi, a Damascus cab driver, underlined the doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam is crazy," he said. "He wants every Arab city, not just Kuwait." He 
paused for a moment, and then added, "But who can feel sorry for those rich 
people in the gulf?" 
</P>
<P>
There has been no open defiance, however. The Assad regime "would hit them 
(protesters) like they did eight years ago," the European envoy said, referring 
to Hassad's brutal suppression of a fundamentalist uprising in the city of Hama 
in 1982. "They wouldn't hesitate." 
</P>
<P>
He and others said some grumbling was evident in the Syrian military. 
</P>
<P>
"One, they're unhappy at the prospect of being stationed alongside Western 
troops," the European said, "and two, they're not going to make money in the 
Saudi desert. Lebanon, by comparison, has always been a choice assignment. In 
Lebanon (where 35,000 Syrian soldiers are deployed) you can become rich. A 
division commander there is like an old Ottoman satrap; the money just rolls 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab issue is harder to gauge, particularly as it applies to Syria's 
long-held claim to championing the cause against Israel. In fact, Palestinians 
here are kept under tight control and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, ranks high among Assad's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
The loyal Palestinians, including Ahmed Jibril, head of the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, have found a place under the 
regime as a counterweight to the mainline PLO. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an ugly world," one envoy said, "and it pays to have some of these 
guys around." 
</P>
<P>
Jibril has been implicated in the December, 1988, bombing of a Pan American 
jetliner over Scotland, and his presence here has kept Syria on the U.S. 
terrorist list. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian officials, including Assad, separate the gulf crisis from the 
Palestinian cause. 
</P>
<P>
"The liberation of Jerusalem cannot start in Kuwait," one said. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion has, however, had a direct impact here economically, for 
both good and ill. Syria, a minor player in Middle East oil production, is 
profiting from the price increase forced by the crisis. Production is estimated 
at 400,000 to 420,000 barrels a day, with about half retained for domestic 
needs. The rest is exported for badly needed hard currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, so far the lone exporter, moves its crude to the Mediterranean coast 
through a pipeline that carried Iraqi oil until the Baghdad connection was shut 
down in 1982, near the outset of the Iran-Iraq War, in which Syria and Libya 
were Iran's sole Arab supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing against the windfall in oil revenues is the loss of remittances from 
Syrians working in the gulf states, an estimated 50,000. Those in Kuwait alone 
sent home about $200 million last year, a foreign economic analyst said. Now 
many are returning to a country afflicted with high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Hard economic times are nothing new for Assad's regime. Middle East politics is 
the more dangerous challenge. Diplomats ask: What if Hussein survives the 
military and economic stranglehold and the American-led foreign forces 
withdraw? Or what if Israel is drawn into the conflict? 
</P>
<P>
"Syria loses either way," the European diplomat said. "An Iraqi victory means 
Baghdad will be the champion of the Arabs on the Palestinian issue. And if 
Israel comes in, the whole region goes backward again."

Iraq's decision to seize all of Kuwait rather than just a smaller, more 
defendable portion has left its forces vulnerable to an assault from the sea 
and provided an attractive opening for U.S. forces should war come, a U.S. 
military official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. John LaPlante, commander of a U.S. amphibious task force in the Gulf 
of Oman, said Iraq's full-scale invasion has confronted it with the need to 
erect coastal defenses along the nation's long shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the Iraqi military has faced such a task, and "I don't 
think they're very good at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's move to seize the entire nation Aug. 2 surprised many U.S. analysts, who 
expected any military thrust to take just the northern part of the country, 
giving Iraq some desired sea access, lessening hostile world reaction and 
providing a more secure military position. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a seaborne assault is considered a strong possible option if the United 
States moves to dislodge Iraq by force. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the entire spectrum of amphibious assault capacity represented in 
this task force," LaPlante declared from the bridge of the Nassau in an 
interview with the first group of reporters to visit the task force since it 
arrived in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Norfolk, Va.-based group, which carries a potential landing force of 10,000 
Marines, is the largest such U.S. unit assembled for combat in about 40 years, 
its commanders said. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-ship unit could land Marines by landing craft, small boat or helicopter 
under the cover of an aerial assault from Harrier jump-jet fighters and a 
barrage from naval guns offshore. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a very potent package if you need to use it," said Maj. Gen. Henry W. 
Jenkins, commander of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, the Marine element 
of the 17,000-member task force. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq reportedly has moved batteries of Silkworm missiles to Kuwait to defend 
against the U.S. threat from the sea. But in interviews on board the 833-foot 
Nassau, the commanders discounted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's capacity to 
build an adequate barrier and expressed confidence that the unit's constant 
mobility would make it difficult for Iraq to counter. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't really know where we are, so we have the element of surprise," 
Jenkins said. "We can pick and choose, depending on what the (commander in 
chief) wants to do, an area and a time of our own choosing." 
</P>
<P>
Until its forceful annexation of Kuwait, Iraq had only a small outlet to the 
sea, and it has virtually no navy. The invasion gave it control of hundreds of 
miles of Kuwaiti coastline and a number of little-defended islands near the 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
There has been considerable speculation among analysts about the possibility of 
a U.S. amphibious assault as an alternative to a punishing land campaign in a 
bid to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by the Navy and Marine commanders Friday represented the most 
extensive public discussion of the subject by senior military officials and 
advanced the theory that Iraq could be highly vulnerable to an attack from the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
Commanders said that the amphibious task force includes 13 ships from the 
Navy's Atlantic armada and five from the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is part of an American fleet in the gulf, the Arabian Sea and 
the eastern Mediterranean that now totals about 30 ships, including the 
aircraft carriers Independence, Saratoga and John F. Kennedy and the battleship 
Wisconsin, which carries 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles. Seven other U.S. ships 
are expected in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The visit to the Nassau was limited to a single television crew and journalists 
from Navy publications, but a videotape of the session, recorded by the Navy 
Broadcasting Service, was made available to reporters in Dhahran. 
</P>
<P>
Below deck, rows of M-60 tanks were aligned with their guns pointing aft 
through the open stern of the vessel as it steamed near a top speed of 24 
knots. 
</P>
<P>
Marines on board said that they had spent much of their time working to ensure 
that their aging M-60 tanks would be ready for use in combat, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like anything else," said Cpl. Jerry Case, the driver in a four-man 
M-60 crew. "You take care of it, and it will take care of you." 
</P>
<P>
On the flight deck, Marine aviators demonstrated the capabilities of their 
Harrier fighters, known as jump jets for their ability to take off on a very 
short runway and to land almost like a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Commanders said that the Harriers, used by British forces in the Falkland 
Islands conflict but never by American forces in combat, would provide an 
amphibious landing with the kind of overhead firepower that previously required 
the help of an aircraft carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. William F. O'Hara, a Harrier pilot, noted that the plane could be "very 
useful in this scenario" because of its ability to land on unimproved fields, 
presumably after an amphibious assault was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the planes might be most likely to be used against Iraq, however, 
O'Hara only smiled wryly and said: "I wish I really knew." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AN AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT 
</P>
<P>
Iraq must defend many miles of Iraqi-Kuwati coastline, extending from the mouth 
of the Shatt al Arab waterway to the Saudi frontier. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. amphibious task force now on station in the Persian Gulf region has a 
potential landing force of 10,000 Marines with M-60 tanks. The force could put 
Marines ashore by landing craft, small boats and helicopters under cover of 
aerial assault from Harrier jump-jet fighters and a barrage from naval guns.

FOREIGN RELATIONS: THE ADMINISTRATION IS REALIGNING ITS ALLIANCES IN THE GULF

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee met privately with Saudi 
Arabian Ambassador Bandar ibn Sultan the week before last, they thought they 
were in for a routine update on events in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
What the Saudi prince told them, however, was about a stunning development here 
in the nation's capital: The Bush Administration had decided to sell Saudi 
Arabia more than $20 billion in advanced weapons -- the biggest single arms 
transfer in history. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Mel Levine, one of Israel's staunchest allies on Capitol Hill, 
was furious. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked to hear it coming from his (Prince Bandar's) lips before I heard 
it from the Administration," said the Santa Monica Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
"It told me that the Administration had had conversations with the Saudis that 
had gone far beyond where they should have gone without consultation with 
Congress," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
Levine's chagrin was not merely over protocol. As the California lawmaker 
conceded later, he also was worried about another issue: The Persian Gulf 
crisis is realigning America's historic relationships in the Middle East -- 
potentially at the expense of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that congressional opposition forced the Administration to 
scale back the package late Friday, that reality remains apparent. 
</P>
<P>
No other nation wields anywhere near the political clout in Washington that 
Israel has enjoyed. By comparison, lobbyists for Arab interests have been 
virtually invisible here in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
But with Israel now essentially on the sidelines in the current crisis, the 
Administration is forging new ties in the region, amassing both political debts 
and new chips that can be cashed in later -- on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the arms sale to Saudi Arabia, the White House also has asked Congress 
to forgive Egypt's $7-billion military debt -- a move that officials here made 
clear was a reward for the leading role Cairo has played in marshaling Arab 
support for sending troops to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Israel immediately asked that its own $4.5 billion in military debts to the 
United States be written off as well, but the White House so far has not 
responded. Officials said last week they were still considering the Israeli 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Making such a gift to Egypt without providing similar benefits for Israel would 
mark a break from previous practice: Until now, Congress has held the amount of 
U.S. aid to Egypt to roughly two-thirds of what it allocates to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The formula is regarded as a reward for Cairo's participation in the Camp David 
peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional committees also are bracing for a deluge of new aid requests by 
other Arab countries that have participated in the gulf operation -- often at 
great political and financial expense. Egypt and Turkey both are expected to 
receive large increases. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, analysts here say that Jordan, another historically close 
ally of the United States, seems likely to lose influence in Washington as the 
result of its role in the Persian Gulf conflict. 
</P>
<P>
As late as last spring, Jordan was so well regarded on Capitol Hill that it was 
one of only four countries -- along with Israel, Egypt and Cyprus -- for which 
money was "earmarked" in the House foreign aid bill. The lawmakers gave Bush 
broad discretion in allocating other funds. 
</P>
<P>
With a population that is 60% Palestinian and largely sympathetic to Iraq, 
Jordan's King Hussein has been in a dangerous spot politically. His 
impoverished country also is in a severe economic crunch, because of the U.N. 
embargo against Iraq and the refugees now crowding its border areas. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that King Hussein initially tried to position himself as a 
mediator between the two sides raised a good deal of resentment among senior 
Administration officials, who had expected that he would be more clearly on the 
Western side. 
</P>
<P>
To some analysts, it also has posed new questions about how far Washington can 
count on Jordan as an ally. "King Hussein and Jordan are going to come out of 
this badly damaged," one lobbyist predicted. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, it could be several years before the shape of the new U.S. 
relationships in the Middle East becomes fully clear, and few expect any other 
country in the region to establish a hold as strong as Israel's on this 
country's loyalties and its sense of obligation. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, "there's a dramatic change already," said James G. Abourezk, a former 
South Dakota senator who lobbies for Arab causes as chairman of the 
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
While some lawmakers and Administration officials deny that this new coziness 
is coming at the expense of Israel, others say Israel's stature will inevitably 
diminish as a result of the favors that Arab states have offered -- and 
delivered -- to help the U.S. effort in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly if the gulf crisis passes without war, "you will see Israel's star 
very much on the wane" as the United States increases its reliance upon the 
Arab countries to protect its strategic interests in the Middle East, Abourezk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Just as alarming to Israel's supporters is evidence that its public support in 
the United States is slipping. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide survey released Tuesday by Times Mirror Co., the corporate 
parent of The Times, only 44% of the respondents rated Israel favorably, while 
45% regarded it unfavorably. 
</P>
<P>
The roughly even split marks a sharp decline from three years ago, when Israel 
received a 65% favorable rating, with only 27% of respondents listing 
themselves as unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the political shift clearer than in the proposed sale of advanced 
jets, tanks and other weapons to the Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when President Reagan proposed selling AWACS radar surveillance planes 
to Saudi Arabia, he sparked one of the bloodiest political battles of his first 
term. He won -- only after placing his own personal prestige on the line. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the opposition to President Bush's plan to sell a far bigger and more 
sophisticated arms package has been surprisingly restrained. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the debate centered on whether the Saudis should get the whole package 
now, or part now and part later. The White House agreed late Friday to split 
the package, seeking congressional approval now for the weapons most urgently 
needed by the Saudis and deferring the rest of the package until next year. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers also argue that any additional aid to the Saudis should be 
balanced by more for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Dutton, a veteran lobbyist for the Saudis, characterized the protest 
against the sale as "standard boilerplate rhetoric from the past . . . from a 
smaller group than before." 
</P>
<P>
One of those most vocal critics has been Levine. "This is a very crazy notion," 
he said. "Here we have sent troops to save the lives of the Saudi regime, and 
we feel that we owe them $20 billion in additional arms." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens, clearly alarmed at what his country fears 
is a pro-Arab tilt by the United States, told Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
last week that Israel should get additional military aid beyond the $1.8 
billion a year it now receives. 
</P>
<P>
"A very large-scale sale of advanced equipment to the Saudis without adequate 
compensation for Israel could upset the military balance in the area, and that 
would be destabilizing," Arens declared.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis is forcing Western European leaders to seek better ways 
of taking collective action in support of their national and common interests. 
</P>
<P>
In a week of private meetings and semi-public seminars in Brussels, where both 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Community are 
headquartered, officials talked about how to deal with aggressive steps taken 
by countries other than the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
High on the program was the crisis touched off by Iraq's invasion of 
neighboring Kuwait last month. 
</P>
<P>
As the threat of Soviet aggression has faded in the wake of the revolution that 
swept across Eastern Europe last year, NATO, the EC and other international 
organizations have focused on how to deal with new possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the subsequent threat to much of the Western 
world, have led defense-minded Western European institutions to re-examine 
their positions on when to extend military power and how to develop a consensus 
on using that power. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans have been critical of Western Europe for not doing its share in 
the gulf crisis. Most of this criticism has been directed at West Germany, 
which has a huge income from exports and a large army and navy but is under 
constitutional restrictions as to what it can do outside the NATO area. 
</P>
<P>
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's pledge to help underwrite the U.S.-led 
multinational force deployed against Iraq in Saudi Arabia, through a 
contribution of billions of dollars, seems to have satisfied Washington. 
Further, Kohl pledged to attempt to rewrite the constitution of a united 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In part because of the U.S. criticism, NATO is indeed looking for ways to 
broaden its charter. Officials in Brussels now agree that it would be legal and 
wise to allow NATO to deploy military forces beyond the frontiers of its 16 
member states if it were in the organization's vital interest to do so. 
</P>
<P>
NATO was upstaged by the Western European Union, which was quick to offer its 
relatively thin services to coordinate Europe's response in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The WEU, based in Paris, is made up France, Britain, West Germany, Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The French are high on it 
because it is not directly affiliated with NATO and not dominated by the United 
States. It has no military command. 
</P>
<P>
But "with the WEU, you need to create an entire administrative structure," 
strategic analyst Edward Luttwak argued. "This, NATO already has." 
</P>
<P>
Another NATO specialist declared bluntly: "The WEU is something of a joke. They 
literally have about seven or eight employees at their headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
And a NATO ambassador had this to say: "The WEU is really a parasite of NATO. 
When they want to offer military cooperation advice, they come to us and ask 
how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis suggested that the 
12-nation European Community form a military component. He said this would be 
in Western Europe's interest and would keep the French from worrying about 
taking directions from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But with the EC's attempt to bring about a single market at the end of 1992, 
including heated arguments about a European monetary system and a central bank, 
few observers here believe the EC could take on military responsibilities very 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Further, if other nations join the EC, particularly those with a neutral 
background like Switzerland, Austria and Sweden, it would be difficult to get 
any kind of consensus on quick action in time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
An Irish diplomat, whose government has adhered to a policy of nonalignment, 
was stunned by De Michelis' suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, EC experts do not rule out some kind of defense arrangement, though only 
in the very long run. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty of finding consensus is also one of the objections to another 
proposal: creating a defense arm for the 35-member CSCE, the Vienna-based 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. This could provide some sort 
of peacekeeping mechanism for all Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with upgrading the CSCE," Prof. William Griffith of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, "is that it is too big -- like the 
U.N. General Assembly. You'd never get a unanimous vote or even a consensus to 
act in time to respond to any crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Most European leaders turn back to NATO as the best organization to coordinate 
military activities involving member nations within or beyond their frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
NATO seems certain to reduce its force levels and headquarters staff now that 
the Soviet threat seems to have disappeared, but many diplomats and officers 
here believe it could be rejuvenated by giving it a broader role. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of many people in Brussels, NATO has the advantage -- although some 
think it a disadvantage -- of not being entirely European, of having the United 
States and Canada as members. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Manfred Woerner, the NATO secretary general, and other officials point to 
NATO's huge integrated military structure, built up over 40 years, and argue 
that it would be illogical to dismantle it. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. John Galvin, NATO's military commander, has urged the organization to 
rethink its treaty strictures and look farther afield, or "out of area." 
</P>
<P>
One of the top NATO planners is now suggesting that the organization is really 
not legally bound to restrict its military activities to the organization's 
geographical area, so long as all member nations agree that an outside crisis 
truly affects the national interests of all. 
</P>
<P>
And other NATO experts agree that they ought to set their sights beyond the 
horizon, but they add that it must be done with sensitivity and caution. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance," one ambassador commented at a NATO dinner, "we want to support 
the U.S. in the gulf, not only because of Iraqi aggression but because our 
vital interests are affected too. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think anyone -- including the U.S. -- would want to plant the NATO 
flag on a Saudi Arabian sand dune. We don't want to make it look as if a bunch 
of Christian Crusaders have arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Some people at NATO worry about public opinion assuming that the organization 
isn't doing enough when needed. But Simon Lunn of the North Atlantic Assembly 
pointed out that "NATO can't do what it is not set up to do; you've got to 
change the brief." 
</P>
<P>
He said he thinks NATO is doing pretty well in responding under its charter to 
the gulf crisis.

The World Health Organization said Friday that the sale of useless or 
potentially dangerous drugs is hampering its worldwide campaign against the 
most common causes of death among children. 
</P>
<P>
A WHO statement said an estimated 8 million children die each year of diarrhea 
and acute respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
It said at least $1 billion is wasted each year on "inappropriate treatment" of 
the two diseases, neither of which need be major killers. Together, the 
afflictions are blamed for causing more than half of all deaths of children 
under five years of age, WHO said. 
</P>
<P>
Dehydration, which causes most diarrhea deaths, can be inexpensively treated 
with rehydration salts, it said. Death from pneumonia can be prevented with an 
appropriate antibiotic, "in most cases a low-priced oral formulation."

CEAUSESCU'S SON, NICU, IS CONVICTED, GETS 20 YEARS

A military tribunal on Friday sentenced Nicu Ceausescu, the youngest son of the 
former Romanian dictator, to a 20-year prison term for his actions during the 
revolution that toppled his father. 
</P>
<P>
In its unanimous sentence, the five-member panel of judges dropped the original 
charge of complicity in genocide and instead found the 39-year-old Ceausescu 
guilty of "instigation to murder." 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu, who was Communist Party leader in the southern Transylvanian town of 
Sibiu, was accused in connection with 89 deaths there during the December 
revolution that toppled his father, Nicolae Ceausescu. His father and mother, 
Elena, were executed last Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Nicu Ceausescu had pleaded innocent to the genocide charge but guilty to a 
charge of illegally possessing firearms. The military tribunal found him guilty 
of the firearms charge and sentenced him to five years in prison, to be served 
concurrently with the 20-year term for what the court called "instigation to 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
He was also stripped of the right to vote and hold public office for 10 years, 
and ordered to pay the state's legal fees of $250. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu said he will appeal the conviction. His attorney, Paula Iacob, told 
reporters she is confident she can "prove him innocent." The appeal must be 
submitted within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an innocent man," she said. "His misfortune was having the name 
Ceausescu." 
</P>
<P>
Four top officials of Nicolae Ceausescu's regime, including Communist Party 
Secretary Emil Bobu, earlier had been found guilty of genocide. They were 
sentenced to life in prison. Their appeals were rejected.

ZULUS' LEADER BUTHELEZI WELCOMES MANDELA TALKS

<P>
Zulu leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi on Friday cautiously welcomed an 
invitation from Nelson Mandela's African National Congress for talks next month 
on ending South Africa's township carnage. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first meeting since Mandela's release from jail last February 
between the ANC deputy president and the conservative Buthelezi, whose 
supporters are fighting a bloody battle for supremacy in black townships. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, head of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, said he would be 
delighted to attend if the ANC is sincere in wanting to end the strife between 
the two movements. 
</P>
<P>
"I state firstly that these are welcome developments. Secondly, however, I must 
state that they need to be seen in their proper perspective," Buthelezi said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ANC had suggested Oct. 5 for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said he had been invited along with the leaders of South Africa's 10 
quasi-autonomous homelands, created by the white government to perpetuate the 
apartheid system. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will attend "because Dr. Mandela and I must get together as 
respective leaders of the two dominant black political organizations involved 
in the violence." 
</P>
<P>
About 760 people have died in fighting between Inkatha and the ANC in the past 
six weeks. More than 4,000 people have died in a four-year virtual civil war 
between the two movements in South Africa's Natal province. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has until now refused to meet Buthelezi face to face, accusing the Zulu 
leader of trying to shoot his way into the ANC's negotiations on black 
power-sharing with President Frederik W. de Klerk's government. 
</P>
<P>
But after three days of talks between ANC and Inkatha officials, the parties 
decided that a meeting with all homeland leaders, including Buthelezi, is 
necessary to get to the root of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela toned down his previous criticism of Buthelezi, describing him on 
British television as "My old friend. He is still my friend." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews on ABC and NBC Friday, Mandela said the peace process is 
threatened and he will arm ANC members unless De Klerk's government does 
something to stop the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Townships around Johannesburg remained calm Friday, and South Africa's top 
policeman, Gen. Johan van der Merwe, said a weeklong lull in the fighting 
resulted partly from a security clampdown ordered last weekend by De Klerk.

ARAB MOB BURNS ISRAELI SOLDIER TO DEATH FOLLOWING CAR ACCIDENT

An angry mob of Arab refugees stoned and burned an Israeli reserve soldier to 
death after his car struck two Palestinian teen-agers in a refugee camp, the 
army said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The soldier, who was not identified, had driven his car by mistake into the 
Bureij refugee camp at about 11 a.m. Thursday when the streets were full of 
shoppers, an army spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian youths immediately stoned the civilian car, which had yellow 
Israeli license plates. The soldier, who was in uniform, tried to escape and 
accidentally hit a donkey cart, injuring two Arab brothers riding on it, the 
spokesman and Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"The accident caused severe rioting in the location," the spokesman said. "The 
car was stoned with rocks. The driver was injured, and the vehicle was set on 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
The slaying occurred on the start of Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, a national 
and religious holiday when most places of business and entertainment are 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Israeli politicians on the right and left condemned the attack. 
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, head of the right-wing Tsomet Party, was 
quoted by Israel Radio as saying, "The army should wipe from the surface of the 
earth all the houses near the scene of the murder. I'll suggest it at Sunday's 
Cabinet meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Several Parliament members said the brutal slaying showed the intifada, or Arab 
uprising, is not finished. Shevah Weiss, a member of the center-left opposition 
Labor Party, called the killing "a victory for the extremists," adding it 
showed the depth of hatred motivating Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the car was set on fire, soldiers arrived and dispersed the 
crowd, Palestinian sources said. Bureij camp, home to more than 16,000 
Palestinians, was placed under curfew and the Gaza Strip declared a closed 
military zone, preventing journalists from entering. 
</P>
<P>
The military censor held up publication of the incident for more than 21 hours 
while the soldier's family was notified.

A federal grand jury on Friday indicted five more legislators on charges 
involving bribery and drugs, bringing to 10 the number of lawmakers charged as 
a result of an FBI investigation of the South Carolina Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a registered lobbyist was indicted on a drug possession charge. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments grew out of an FBI investigation into vote-buying in the South 
Carolina General Assembly. Of five legislators charged in August, three have 
pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments are beginning to raise questions at the Statehouse about the 
impact of the investigation on black lawmakers. Four of the 10 legislators who 
have been indicted are black. There are 19 black legislators in the 170-member 
General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators charged Friday with violating the Hobbs Act, a federal bribery 
law, were Reps. Thomas Limehouse, Ennis Fant, Larry Blanding and B. J. Gordon. 
All but Limehouse are black. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rep. Donna A. Moss was charged with misdemeanor cocaine 
possession. She resigned her seat Friday. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Bob Sheheen suspended the indicted lawmakers, which is required 
by House rules. 
</P>
<P>
Limehouse, 31, was charged in a three-count indictment with two violations of 
the Hobbs Act. He was accused of accepting $2,000 from Ron Cobb, a lobbyist who 
worked undercover for the FBI in the sting operation known as Operation Lost 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
Limehouse was also charged with conspiracy to solicit bribes and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Fant, 29, Blanding, 37, and Gordon, 57, were charged together in one count of 
conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act. Each was charged separately with accepting 
bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Violations of the Hobbs Act carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Moss, 36, is charged with possession of cocaine during the 1989 legislative 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged was lobbyist James Madison Brown V, on one count of misdemeanor 
possession of marijuana in September, 1989.

A 72-year-old California man who helped his terminally ill wife commit suicide 
in a Detroit-area hotel room pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of murder and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Recorders Court Judge Isadore Torres allowed an attorney for Bertram 
Harper of Loomis, Calif., to enter the plea. 
</P>
<P>
Harper is charged with the Aug. 19 death of his 69-year-old wife, Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The retired chemical engineer earlier this month returned to California to 
await trial after posting a $25,000 bond and appearing at preliminary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Harper, who had cancer, died after swallowing a mixture of pills and 
placing a plastic bag over her head. An autopsy disclosed that she died of 
asphyxiation. Harper admitted in a taped police interview that he tied the bag 
around her neck after she fell into a deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Bertram Harper said the family came to Michigan believing that assisted suicide 
was legal in the state, unlike California, where it is a felony.

CULTIST GIVEN DEATH PENALTY IN SLAYING OF 5

A religious cult leader who called himself a prophet was sentenced to death 
Friday for killing a family of five. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Lundgren, 40, listened stoically as Lake County Common Pleas Judge 
Martin O. Parks set the death sentence for April 17, 1991, exactly two years 
after the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Appeals probably will delay execution far beyond that date. 
</P>
<P>
Parks said Lundgren displayed "a great lack of remorse." 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing occurred a day after a jury recommended the death penalty for 
Lundgren, who formed a cult after he was defrocked in 1988 as a lay minister of 
the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted on Aug. 29 of five counts of aggravated murder and five counts 
of kidnaping in the deaths of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three children, 
ages 7, 13 and 15. They were killed on a northeast Ohio farm where the cult 
members lived. 
</P>
<P>
The Averys were bound, gagged and shot one at a time, then buried in a pit 
inside a barn. Police found the bodies on Jan. 4 after receiving a tip from an 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day that Lundgren was convicted, his wife, Alice, was sentenced to 
life in prison for conspiracy, complicity and kidnaping. Their son, Damon, was 
convicted on the same charges as Lundgren. His sentencing hearing begins 
Monday.

ENVIRONMENT: LOGGERS AND CONSERVATIONISTS ARE NOT APPEASED BY ADMINISTRATION 
PANEL'S PLAN TO SAVE THE OWL AND AID THE TIMBER INDUSTRY.

<P>
Months ago, when the fate of the spotted owl first defined the battle lines 
between loggers and environmentalists, the drum rolls began: The Bush 
Administration would have to make a historic decision about the future of the 
Pacific Northwest and its dwindling ancient forests. 
</P>
<P>
Would the "I want to be an environmentalist" President side with the scientists 
and act to save the owl by sharply reducing the harvest from publicly owned 
national forests in Northern California, Oregon and Washington? Or, would the 
free-market businessman President side with the timber industry and permit 
large-scale logging of the national forests in the name of a healthy economy 
and preserving jobs? 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it seems that the politician in the President won out with a 
familiar move -- an attempt to split the difference and call it a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
But this fight resists the easy blurring of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bush Administration, rather than reaching out and charting history, may 
find that it accomplished nothing more than setting down just another 
inconclusive step on a muddy trail of tears. 
</P>
<P>
In literal terms, the Bush Administration tilted fairly sharply to the side of 
the loggers. 
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet-level task force rejected the nearly universal opinion of scientists 
that logging national forests in the Pacific Northwest had to be reduced by a 
third to safeguard the owl from extinction. Speaking for the Administration, 
the task force said Friday that the owl habitat could be preserved and the 
overall reduction in harvest could be held to half that level. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, setting aside the owl habitat, which generally represents the 
most remote areas of the forest, means that there are far fewer remaining areas 
on which timber cutting can occur. Some of them are scenic corridors near urban 
areas, such as Seattle. Some of them are in steep canyons, where cutting could 
cause erosion and harm to stream beds. The fate of other animal species could 
be involved. Few if any of the areas are without potential controversy. 
</P>
<P>
So the Administration recommended that Congress provide loggers with a waiver, 
or "insulation," from many environmental protection laws for the 1991 harvest. 
Otherwise, the Administration acknowledged, the proposal "will be a hollow 
promise." 
</P>
<P>
But was it realistic to ask Congress to enact such a waiver in the few 
remaining days of its session, which ends Oct. 20? 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to take this proposal seriously," said Victor M. Sher, 
Seattle attorney with the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. "It adds nothing 
constructive to the debate in the Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
Because the industry did not get the go-ahead to cut as much or more than last 
year, it professed "no joy" at the Administration recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Just like environmental groups, timber companies want to settle this long fight 
as soon as possible. Some industry leaders are banking on the fact that 
Congress eventually will convene the government's Endangered Species Committee, 
composed of high-ranking federal officials who have the power to determine that 
saving the owl from extinction is not as important as the economic 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The industry all along has cast this as a matter of saving jobs for lumbermen 
and mill workers. Again, Friday, American Forest Resource Alliance said that 
the Administration had "jeopardized these families and communities." 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists charged that this was a cruel smoke screen. If the 
industry wanted to save jobs, it would stop shipping one of every four raw, 
unmilled logs to Japan and the Far East, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the owl -- and the larger question of the ancient forests -- may be 
headed toward another showdown in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Kerr, firebrand leader of the Oregon Natural Resources Council in 
Portland, said that he believes Congress will not complete action on the 
Administration proposal by Oct. 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year. At 
that time, the government will be without a plan to save the owl and "will be 
in violation of the endangered species act. 
</P>
<P>
"And as long as the Administration insists on violating the law, it is the duty 
of environmentalists to seek to enforce it" through court action. 
</P>
<P>
In California, some environmentalists think that the pro-logging slant of 
Friday's decision will backfire and help the campaign for Proposition 130, the 
so-called "Forests Forever" ballot initiative. This measure would ban clear 
cutting and give environmentalists a voice on the State Board of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
"We will hope this galvanizes the people of California to go out in November 
and vote for the 'Forests Forever' initiative and do what is within their power 
to counteract this frontal assault on our ancient forest environment," said 
Nathaniel Lawrence of the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Eckery, vice president of industry affairs for the Timber Assn. of 
California, figures that voters will instead show some sympathy for the once 
storied but now embattled logger. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a sense of fairness on the part of the voters. They see all 
these events coming down on timber families, and I think they might be less 
inclined to make it even worse by passing something disastrous like Prop. 130."

Xu Xiangqian, one of the famed 10 marshals of the Communist Party's Red Army, 
died Friday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
Xu, a former defense minister, led a division of the Red Army on the Long March 
in which about 90,000 people trekked nearly 6,000 miles to escape Nationalist 
Party forces. About half of the marchers died during the journey, which ended 
in early 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Xu later led guerrilla units against the Japanese invaders. 
</P>
<P>
Nie Rongzhen is now the only survivor among the 10 marshals, who included Mao 
Zedong's heir, Lin Biao. 
</P>
<P>
The nationally televised evening news, which opened its newscast by showing a 
portrait of Xu and playing solemn music, said he died after a long illness. No 
other details of his death were given. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-minute television report said no funeral or memorial service would be 
held, at Xu's request. 
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Xu Xiangqian devoted his entire life to the Chinese people's 
revolution and building (of a nation) and has earned the love and respect of 
the entire nation," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Communist Party in 1927 and became active in its underground work 
against the ruling Nationalists. He helped set up one of the Communists' first 
revolutionary base areas, which became a center for its political and military 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Forces under Xu's command captured the key northern city of Taiyuan in April, 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
After the Communist takeover, he held a series of prominent posts in the party, 
military and government until 1967, when he was accused of opposing Lin Biao 
and sabotaging the radical leftist Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, he was reelected to the party's Central Committee. He was appointed 
minister of defense in March, 1978, a post he held until 1981. 
</P>
<P>
As defense minister, Xu kept alive Mao's idea of a "people's army" but argued 
for a well-trained, well-equipped military force. He also advocated use of 
foreign military technology, a departure from China's policy of 
self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
To win support for his views, Xu made alarming predictions of imminent Soviet 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Xu's military and political career ended in 1985, when he and other aging 
leaders, including fellow marshals Nie and Ye Jianying, were forced to resign. 
At the time, Xu was on the Politburo and Central Committee and was a vice 
chairman of the Central Military Commission.

WILD RIDE HELPING WILSON STRIP AWAY UNDERCOVER REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midway through a campaign speech anecdote about a ride he took last summer with 
undercover cops, Pete Wilson stopped short. 
</P>
<P>
"Under cover," the Republican nominee for governor repeated in mock dismay. 
"I've been under cover without intending to be . . . for years." 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore. Wilson, engaged in the toughest political task of his lifetime, 
has taken voters on a wild ride the last few weeks, hurtling between 
attention-getting stunts and hard-edged portrayals of a declining California, 
between warmly personal commercial advertisements and stilted, yet earnest 
policy statements. 
</P>
<P>
At root, Wilson is attempting to mix a carefully crafted appeal as a 
"compassionate conservative" with the sort of offbeat folksy appeal that George 
Bush used successfully in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
This has led to events hardly foreseen for the usually buttoned-down, 
57-year-old senator. On Friday, for example, he met -- privately -- with the 
gold chain-bedecked television personality "Mr. T." Wilson's campaign tried to 
line up the dancing California Raisins for a Central Valley event -- but were 
thwarted by the grapes' refusal to prance for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
What the campaign has pulled off, in the three weeks since the traditional 
Labor Day kick-off, has been visually striking. That very day, several hundred 
supporters in Folsom gaped when Wilson donned an Indian war bonnet and modeled 
it on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days later, he walked into downtown Los Angeles' Grand Central Market, 
handed out pig parts to shoppers and dished up a spicy seafood concoction, all 
the while grinning for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
None of the visual devices are accidental, and Wilson's campaign has not tried 
to make the events seem spontaneous. At the market, the only signs welcoming 
Wilson were at the two stalls where he stopped along with trailing camera 
crews. When Wilson donned his apron and cameras began clicking, some Wilson 
aides exulted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the photo right here! Wasn't this a good idea?" one said to another. 
Sure enough, the picture dominated television and newspaper accounts of 
Wilson's day. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the energetic mugging for cameras, Wilson also is hammering home a 
specific set of issues, all meant to reinforce his self-description as a 
compassionate conservative. Strikingly, the slogan mirrors his Democratic 
opponent Dianne Feinstein's -- "tough but caring." 
</P>
<P>
Crime merits mention at almost every stop, with Wilson playing to voter 
impressions that Republicans take a tougher approach than Democrats to criminal 
justice. Running his campaign against an opponent seeking to be the first woman 
governor of California, Wilson is also aiming his appeal at women. 
</P>
<P>
Murder, gang warfare or drive-by shootings, for example, are rarely mentioned. 
But rape is commonly cited. "Why should a woman have to fear to walk from her 
job to a car in a parking lot?" Wilson asks at almost every stop. Wilson's 
campaign director, Otto Bos, has denied that the appeal is directed at women. 
</P>
<P>
Prenatal health care, and the plight of premature babies, is also a common 
theme in Wilson's speeches, and one that runs counter to the approach of 
traditional conservatives who oppose government intervention in such matters. 
The senator emphasizes not only the humanitarian aspects of providing care but 
also the fiscal ones -- increased health care before birth, as he points out, 
can mean decreased expenses afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Every woman in this state who does not now have prenatal care should have it," 
he says regularly. Wilson does not explain in detail how many women would be 
covered, what the costs would be, and how women would be reached to take part 
in such a program. In that, Wilson is not unlike most politicians. Rather than 
explain his prerogatives in specifics, he frequently leaves the details to 
briefing papers and delivers to audiences a once-over-lightly view of what he 
won't do. 
</P>
<P>
As governor, Wilson tells listeners, he will be an activist but will not make 
"enormous additions to government." He says he will add money in areas that 
have been ignored -- prenatal health care, mental health services -- but he 
won't gut necessary services to pay for those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Wilson has emphasized volunteerism -- which by definition carries 
with it a small price tag -- as a solution to pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, in a proposal that drew praise from surprised teachers and 
others not usually in Wilson's camp, the senator said he would integrate social 
welfare programs into the state's schools. He promised that he would establish 
county councils that would move social workers into elementary and secondary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he acknowledged that the program would cost money, and said he 
would talk more about that later in the campaign. But now Wilson does not talk 
about that program -- or its cost. These days, he suggests that problems in the 
schools, ranging from overcrowding to high dropout rates, can be solved if 
adults and student peers pitch in to provide support for troubled students. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Wilson is trying to broaden the gulf between him and Feinstein -- 
a reflection of Republican fears that if the two candidates are perceived as 
holding the same positions on the issues, Feinstein will have the advantage 
because of her more charismatic image. 
</P>
<P>
As part of that strategy, Wilson has taken to telling audiences, as he did to a 
group of Latino business leaders in Los Angeles the other day, that "I am a 
lifelong conservative Republican." 
</P>
<P>
He tries to ally Feinstein with what he calls "a handful of arrogant liberals" 
who have stymied changes in criminal law and made California "needlessly 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Crime victims do, indeed, represent an emotional element of Wilson's campaign. 
A recent Wilson campaign commercial features crime victims thanking Wilson for 
his support. Another ad, in the same emotional vein, shows a concerned Wilson 
peering over the edge of a neo-natal incubator and speaking of the horror of 
drug abuse through the umbilical cord. 
</P>
<P>
In person, Wilson's approach rarely meets the standard set by his campaign 
commercials. His dry wit, effective one-to-one, can get lost when he is before 
a microphone in a room with hundreds of people. Although it loosens up 
occasionally, his oratory tends to be bureaucratic. 
</P>
<P>
On Labor Day, before an audience of police officers at Mile Square Park in 
Orange County, Wilson was appealing for better benefits for the families of 
slain officers. He was using a personal pitch -- the shooting death in 1908 of 
his grandfather, a Chicago detective. 
</P>
<P>
But while the anecdote was personal, Wilson's descriptions sounded like they 
came from an IRS manual. The shooting, he said, left his grandmother a "single 
female head of household." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the warm, positive image Wilson presents in his television ads, 
he adopts a biting edge when he talks about Feinstein on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference two weeks ago, Wilson was asked about Feinstein's 
just-announced support for Proposition 133, the November initiative that would 
add a half-cent to the state's sales tax to benefit drug-fighting programs. 
</P>
<P>
"What Dianne is doing is what she usually does, she says put somebody else's 
money (into the fight)," Wilson told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The tart remark led reporters to believe Wilson opposed the proposition. It 
turned out, however, that he does not. Indeed, he said, he "may very well" vote 
for it.

Strong winds forced two U.S. Navy helicopters to make rough landings on a 
forested slope in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, slightly injuring all nine people 
on board, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman disputed initial reports that the two CH-46 Sea Knight 
helicopters had collided when they landed near Lobdell Lake in the Sweetwater 
Mountains about 6:30 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a collision, but a hard landing," said Navy spokesman Bob Howard. 
"They were flying in line, one forward and one aft, and a severe downdraft 
forced the one in back down first, and then the one in front was forced down." 
</P>
<P>
The incident remained under investigation by the Navy to determine the exact 
cause of the incident, Howard said.

U.S. PRESENTS PLAN TO SAVE OWL, LOGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS and JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a partial victory for the timber industry and a blow to environmentalists, 
the Bush Administration Friday proposed a plan that it said would preserve the 
territory of the northern spotted owl while allowing additional logging in 
other areas in an attempt to save jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet-level task force recommended a 1991 timber harvest on U.S. Forest 
Service lands of 3.51 billion board feet, including 310 million board feet from 
Northern California and 3.2 billion from Oregon and Washington. The figure 
includes 200 million board feet carried over from 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended harvest represents a reduction of about 20% from current 
levels. Even so, it is higher than the 2.6 billion board feet recommended by 
scientific experts as the minimum reduction needed to save the owl. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, however, noted that nothing in the task force 
recommendations "would require sales of timber from the habitat conservation 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
"The task force sought to balance conservation of the spotted owl and the 
economic well-being of families who live in the region," said a statement 
issued by Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and Interior Secretary 
Manuel Lujan Jr., who headed the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a perfect answer, because a perfect answer does not exist," they 
said. "But it is the beginning of a good balance built on knowledge and 
dialogue to protect our heritage, while minimizing economic dislocation in 
timber-dependent communities of the Pacific Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
The task force urged Congress, which sets timber harvest levels annually, to 
immediately approve its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration acknowledged, however, that the proposed level of tree 
cutting could not occur under current laws governing scenic areas, water 
quality and the like. It called on Congress to write an exemption to those laws 
and allow the cutting to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the federal government said that the recommended harvest level could 
be accomplished without cutting into those areas needed to preserve the owl, 
environmentalists and others in the Northwest are worried that there will be 
massive amounts of clear-cutting in other areas, including some of the 
Northwest scenic corridors. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration has been looking at this as if it's only a jobs vs. owls 
issue," said Fran Hunt, a forestry resource specialist with the National 
Wildlife Federation. "What they don't see is that we're dealing with an 
ecosystem that was once 20 to 30 million acres in size and has already been 
reduced by logging to something around 10% of its original size. Once it's 
gone, it's gone. They're coming up with a short-term fix. What will happen to 
the loggers when the last 10% of the forest is gone?" 
</P>
<P>
Syd Butler, the Wilderness Society's vice president for conservation, called 
the Administration's language "sleight of hand," adding: "They are not saying 
there shall be no sales of timber from habitat conservation areas." 
</P>
<P>
Butler said that it would be impossible to harvest that much timber "without 
decimating owl habitat." 
</P>
<P>
Timber industry spokesmen, however, also reacted without joy to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"This deadly serious game over the fate of the Pacific Northwest economy has 
just begun," said Mark Rey, executive director of the American Forest Resource 
Alliance. "The timber families that depend on the forest products industry for 
their livelihoods cannot tolerate the continuation of the historical downward 
trend in federal timber harvest." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Draper, executive secretary of the Western Council of Industrial 
Workers of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, 
AFL-CIO, which represents 23,000 workers in the timber industry, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposed plan would make workers in the Pacific Northwest an endangered 
species," he said. "Thousands of hard-working Americans depend upon public 
timberland for their own survival." He said that the Administration 
recommendations represent "a formula for economic depression, personal 
hardship, and social turmoil . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.), ranking Republican on the 
Senate Appropriations Committee, said that the appropriations process likely 
would approve a harvest level comparable to the figures proposed by the task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said it is not clear whether Congress would act on the 
Administration recommendations to circumvent laws regulating other lands, 
including the National Forest Management Act and National Environmental Policy 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
"We face an uphill fight," said Rep. Douglas H. Bosco, a Democrat who 
represents the north coastal region of California. He predicted that the plan 
would cost his district "thousands of jobs." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in Congress don't know the issue -- they only tangentially 
understand the economics," he said. "Getting anything through Congress -- 
especially something that would fly in the face of very powerful environmental 
groups -- would be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) agreed, saying that it would be "politically very 
difficult" to get Congress to change existing laws to allow the recommended 
timber harvesting. "I think the members are going to insist on a long-term 
approach, and the clock is really ticking down on this session," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration asked Congress to enact legislation to authorize the 
immediate convening of the Endangered Species Committee. The special panel, 
known informally as the "God Squad," could override the Endangered Species Act 
in cases of severe economic and social distress. 
</P>
<P>
"This recommendation would not in any way alter the substance of the Endangered 
Species Act," the task force said. "The intent is to allow the Endangered 
Species Committee to act efficiently and in a timely manner in applying the 
standards of the ESA to actions taken by the federal land management agencies." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) called the recommendations "a mixed bag" for Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to have had them recommend a slightly higher level of cut," 
he said. "However, I'm pleased with their recommendation to immediately convene 
the Endangered Species Committee." Packwood said that he plans to press 
legislation "to jump-start the God Squad," adding: "I want to get this 
legislation passed this year." 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said that he will appoint a team to begin developing a "recovery plan" 
for the owl, as required by the Endangered Species Act. "This recovery plan 
will outline a series of steps needed for the conservation of the owl and will 
be developed with extensive involvement of scientific experts, environmental 
organizations, timber interests and the public." 
</P>
<P>
Lujan and Yeutter said that the task force will continue to function, with an 
expanded mission to "broadly review the nation's forest management needs." 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet-level panel, which was appointed in June, was composed of the 
secretaries of agriculture and the Interior and the heads of the Office of 
Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Council on 
Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The group missed its Sept. 1 deadline by three weeks, with its members 
reportedly deadlocked in debate over what to recommend. 
</P>
<P>
The panel began its work after a decision by Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service to list the spotted owl as a "threatened" species, a classification 
that requires the federal government to develop a protection plan. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a blue-ribbon committee of scientists issued a document known as the 
Jack Ward Thomas Report, which recommended a substantial cutback in the Pacific 
Northwest timber harvest to save the owl. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomas report -- which has been described as the minimum action that must 
be taken to save the owl -- suggested that the Administration adopt guidelines 
developed by the U.S. Forest Service that call for reducing the timber harvest 
on Forest Service lands to 2.6 billion board feet a year, down from more than 4 
billion during the 1980s.

MEDELLIN DRUG TRAFFICKERS RESUME TERROR CAMPAIGN;

COLOMBIA: THREE HOSTAGES ARE TAKEN TO BACK AMNESTY DEMANDS. THE GOVERNMENT

<P>
The Colombian government refused Friday to acknowledge publicly what the local 
news media are calling a fact: Medellin drug traffickers have resumed their 
terrorist campaign by seizing at least three hostages. 
</P>
<P>
A statement sent to newspapers, radio and television stations late Thursday 
confirmed that traffickers had kidnaped two leading journalists and the sister 
of Colombia's ambassador to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the hostages would be freed only when the government of 
President Cesar Gaviria agrees to grant drug traffickers amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo Angel refused to discuss the demands at a Friday 
news conference. He said that the government had still not determined whether 
traffickers of the so-called Medellin cartel were behind the recent kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not speculate on unverified reports of the cartel's responsibility," 
Giraldo told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But a senior journalist at El Tiempo, Colombia's leading newspaper, said 
government officials had privately acknowledged the cartel's responsibility for 
Wednesday's kidnaping of the daily's managing editor, Francisco Santos. An 
armed band abducted Santos, the 28-year-old son of El Tiempo's publisher, 
Wednesday after forcing his car to the side of the road and killing his 
chauffeur. 
</P>

El Tiempo has reported that it received several calls from a man, identified as 
Carlos Jimenez, who represented the cartel. The caller said traffickers had 
kidnaped Santos and several other Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to believe that the calls were authentic," the El Tiempo 
source said, while asking not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has told us that it will not deal directly with the cartel to 
obtain the release of Francisco," the journalist said. "The Gaviria 
administration is moving very cautiously in order to avoid the accusation that 
it is negotiating with Pablo Escobar." 
</P>
<P>
Escobar is the cartel's leader, accused of masterminding terrorist attacks that 
have killed more than 500 people since August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Both the caller and the cartel statement said traffickers are also holding 
Diana Turbay de Uribe, the editor of a news magazine and daughter of former 
Colombian president Julio Cesar Turbay. Turbay de Uribe is missing along with 
five other journalists who had been working with her. Another Bogota newspaper, 
La Prensa, reported Friday that the cartel is planning to release the other 
five journalists, including a West German. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the cartel also claimed responsibility for Wednesday's 
kidnaping of Marina Montoya, the sister of Colombia's ambassador to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Both the phone calls to El Tiempo and the cartel statement give further 
evidence that traffickers have ended a two-month-old cease-fire in their 
terrorist campaign. Traffickers said in July that they were suspending bombings 
and assassinations to show their desire for peace. 
</P>
<P>
The move was intended to pressure Gaviria, who took office Aug. 7, to call off 
the government's anti-drug crackdown, which began in 1989. As part of the 
campaign, Gaviria's predecessor, Virgilio Barco Vargas, had decreed new 
anti-drug measures, including the extradition of trafficking suspects to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria pledged to maintain the pressure on the cartel, but he soon offered 
traffickers incentives for maintaining their truce and turning themselves in. A 
recent presidential order said that surrendering drug suspects would be tried 
at home rather than extradited to the United States. It also offered 
traffickers reduced prison sentences in exchange for their cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the cartel, viewing Gaviria's peace overture as inadequate, 
decided to take hostages to force negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Medellin cartel is obviously dissatisfied with the government's plan," 
said the El Tiempo journalist. "It wants much more than a promise of trial in 
Colombia, and it is willing to use terrorist tactics once again to achieve its 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
The source added that Gaviria's efforts to persuade traffickers to surrender 
had failed. He repeated what the Medellin cartel representative had told the 
paper, "None, absolutely none of us, will turn ourselves in." 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria has yet to acknowledge that the cartel is restarting its terrorist 
campaign. But the president said in a television interview broadcast Thursday 
that the government miight be willing to "revise the extradition mechanism" if 
traffickers refrain from carrying out new terrorist attacks.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / BOND MEASURES; 
</P>
<P>
VOTERS FACE FIVE TAX-RAISING PROPOSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates came to the City 
Council with what he considered urgent business: Thousands of 911 emergency 
calls went unanswered each week, the chief said, and the only solution was to 
purchase for $235 million a new state-of-the-art system. 
</P>
<P>
Gates proposed taking the matter directly to voters with a bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to get it on in November," he said, "before they realize what's 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
What's happening is that bond measures like the one Gates proposed are making a 
comeback as a post-Proposition 13 approach to funding public improvements 
without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Originally banned under the historic Jarvis-Gann tax initiative, California 
voters reinstated general obligation bonds four years ago with passage of 
Proposition 46. Since then, measures have begun to pop up on local ballots 
throughout the state, and this November, Los Angeles voters will decide on no 
less than five such measures -- two proposed by the city and three by the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city and county officials, whose financial woes began with 
Proposition 13 and have worsened with state and federal budget cuts, see bonds 
as something of a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
Since passage of Proposition 46, city voters have approved five bond measures 
for a variety of projects that could add as much as $61.69 to the average tax 
bill. The two measures on the city ballot in November could bring that total to 
$96.84, but analysts say the real amount is unlikely to reach that figure. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds make it possible to raise tax money beyond the 1% property tax limit set 
by Proposition 13. Approval of two-thirds of the voters is required, and there 
are strict limitations: bond money may be spent only on real property and 
borrowing may not be done to meet operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
With general-obligation bonds, governments can borrow money at 
lower-than-normal interest rates. Lenders are willing to accept lower interest 
payments because there is very little risk in their investment. Each issue 
finances a specific capital project and pay-back comes from a specific tax 
tacked onto every property owner's bill. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 911 measure, city voters on Nov. 6 will be asked to approve 
$100 million worth of bonds to pay for the preservation of affordable housing 
and homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County voters will be asked to raise their property taxes by 
approving an $817 million bond measure -- the largest in the county's history 
-- to pay for park improvements. 
</P>
<P>
County voters have approved one such measure in recent years -- $96 million for 
jail construction -- and officials are considering putting bond measures on the 
1992 ballot to pay for replacing the aging hospital system and bring county 
buildings up to earthquake safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Its fate may be linked to two other measures on the ballot that would generate 
money for county coffers in something of the old-fashioned way: raising taxes. 
Proposition A would provide money for jails, Proposition C would fund 
transportation improvements. Each would boost the sales tax by a half-penny on 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
With all these competing bids to squeeze money from the populace, some 
officials have begun wondering whether voters have reached the limit of their 
generosity. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough is enough," said City Councilman Nate Holden, who opposes one city bond 
measure. "I think it's going to be very difficult for anything to pass this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who as chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee 
is a proponent of the bonds, said: "The people are willing to vote for bond 
issues where they can see the connection between their tax bill and the benefit 
it's going to create for them. But there's not a bottomless pit to these 
things, and as the economy slows down the receptivity will wane." 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, said he sees a 
"limit to how much we can take to the electorate at any one time." 
</P>
<P>
The county measures are opposed by Supervisor Pete Schabarum and the Howard 
Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the real test of where the tax revolt is will come with this 
election," said Joel Fox, president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has taken no position on the city measures because it has not 
thoroughly reviewed them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are literally hundreds of bond measures on the ballots and we can't be 
everywhere and read all of them," said Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the 
association. Vosburgh said nearly every every community in state has one or 
more bond measures on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the bond and tax measures for the city and county of Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION A: COUNTY JAIL CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
<P>
The measure would raise the sales tax by half a cent to seven cents on the 
dollar to finance jail construction and operations and relieve overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
County bureaucrats also view the measure as a device to free funds for strapped 
health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is the result of a successful lobbying effort in Sacramento by Los 
Angeles County officials to obtain a new revenue source for escalating jail 
costs. County officials won passage of legislation that allowed for a tax 
increase for jails only by a simple majority. Usually, approval by two-thirds 
of the voters is required for a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of housing prisoners has soared 458% from $76 million in 1980 to $348 
million this year because of the dramatic increase in drug-related crime, said 
Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
Block, who is pushing Proposition A, estimates that it will cost $1 billion a 
year to operate the county jail system by 1995. The measure would raise $423 
million a year and allow the county to move forward with an aggressive 20-year, 
$3.5-billion plan to build 12 new jails for an estimated 42,230 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION B: COUNTY PARKS 
</P>
<P>
The largest bond measure in county history, it would boost property taxes to 
pay for an $816-million array of recreational and cultural facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The projects include restoring trout habitats, refurbishing the Hollywood Bowl, 
building a mountain camp for troubled youths and upgrading beach and zoo 
facilities. The measure also provides for use of unemployed youth in tree 
planting and graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the owner of a home assessed at $250,000 would pay an additional 
$19.85 the first year. The amount would increase to a high of $46.13 in the 
fourth year before declining. 
</P>
<P>
County parks director Rodney Cooper said the measure would ease the 
department's budget woes by providing $200 million to refurbish deteriorating 
county parks and recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
However, county administrative officer Dixon contends that the measure places 
an additional burden on the budget because it provides funds for park 
acquisition without providing money for maintenance and operations of parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION C: COUNTY TRANSIT PROJECTS 
</P>
<P>
The measure would authorize a half-penny sales tax increase to fund transit 
projects and county officials do not agree about it. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, pushed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, would raise $400 million 
annually to build and operate rail systems, maintain bus service and make 
street improvements. The half-cent sales tax increase would be in addition to 
the $400 million in sales taxes already paid by county consumers under a 
half-cent levy for transit approved in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the county Transportation Commission 
and a usual Bradley ally, is taking no position of Proposition C because he 
believes it is more important for Proposition A to pass. He fears that too many 
tax measures on the ballot may lead to defeat of all. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase would make up for the cuts in federal transit funding that 
have occurred over the last 10 years, said Neil Peterson, executive director of 
the County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION J: 911 SYSTEM 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department wants a new 911 and radio communication 
system that would cost $235 million. So far this year, the department said, 
more than 71,000 calls to 911 have gone unanswered and officials predict that 
the number will be well over 100,000 for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has the unanimous backing of the City Council and the endorsement 
of Bradley. Little public opposition has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the measure will cost the owner of the average 1,500-square-foot 
home $26.25 a year for the next 20 years, according to city figures. 
</P>
<P>
For their money, taxpayers will get two new 911 centers to replace the one now 
operating in a fourth-level sub-basement at City Hall East. Police officials 
argue that two centers are necessary because an earthquake or other natural 
disaster in a one-center system could knock out virtually all emergency 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
The new centers would cost $105 million, leaving $130 million to replace and 
expand the police radio system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION K: HOUSING PRESERVATION 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, the measure would provide $85 
million for low-interest secondary loans to nonprofit groups for buying and 
rehabilitating "at-risk" housing. Another $15 million would be set aside to buy 
and rehabilitate shelters for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Housing units "at-risk" are structures that are either seismically unsafe or 
categorized as "slums," according to a city report backing the measure. The 
rehabilitation program could preserve 2,500 to 5,200 units or more. 
</P>
<P>
But this method of financing housing has never been used in the city of Los 
Angeles and questions remain about the legality of using general obligation 
bonds for loans and grants to private developers, according to Keith Comrie, 
the city administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
Questions also remain about the ability of nonprofit groups to use a large 
infusion of money. The measure is backed by top state Democrats and 
Republicans, anti-poverty advocates, real estate agents, Bradley and City 
Council. Councilman Holden, the lone opponent, says taxpayers have become 
"overly generous" in approving bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to the average homeowner would be $7.75 a year for 20 years, according 
to the city administrative office.

COUNTY'S JAIL HOSPITAL FLAWS CITED IN PAST; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH REVIEWS: INVESTIGATORS EARLIER REPORTED INFESTATIONS AND LACK OF TIMELY 
CARE. MEDICAL DIRECTOR TELLS OF EFFORTS TO COMPLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
County officials were warned two years in a row that conditions at the Los 
Angeles County Jail hospital were unsanitary and that ailing inmates did not 
receive adequate care in some respects, inspection reports show. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, prepared by inspectors in the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services in 1988 and 1989, show the hospital was infested with 
cockroaches and rats, that sick jail inmates did not receive timely medical 
care, and that the medical staff did not confirm that patients received and 
took their medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The reports indicate that county authorities were aware of some of the 
deficiencies discovered by state health officials earlier this year when 
investigators inspected the jail hospital for the first time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
The state investigation -- prompted by the death of an inmate who was strapped 
to a cot in the jail infirmary for six days -- found that the facility failed 
to meet hospital standards in a dozen areas of health care and sanitary 
practices. Those included aspects of patient care; taking proper precautions to 
prevent the spread of infection; disposing of dressings, syringes and medical 
waste properly, and keeping thorough medical records. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials who inspected the jail annually the last two years 
warned authorities that the facility's health care services were not up to the 
standards prescribed by state law for jails, records show. 
</P>
<P>
William Kern, director of medical services for the jail, said that the 
Sheriff's Department tries to comply with the state law that regulates health 
care in jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that jail officials are not always in accord with the county 
health officials' interpretation of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't ignore these things," Kern said. "We do take action. One of the 
things, though, is that we may not agree with everything that they say. It is 
our objective to adhere to the (law) but it's a matter of interpretation. 
Occasionally we do have a disagreement with what they say." 
</P>
<P>
The evaluations are prepared by the county health department for the state 
Board of Corrections, the agency that oversees California's county jails. But 
neither agency has the legal authority to enforce their regulations, both 
county and state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, authorities try to use "friendly persuasion" to motivate jail 
supervisors to upgrade conditions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
John Pederson, deputy director of the Board of Corrections, said the reports 
can provide powerful evidence for disgruntled inmates who file lawsuits against 
the Sheriff's Department for care that they received in the jail hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The reports can be used to prove that jail officials had been informed by a 
governmental agency of specific problems with their health care services, 
Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
In their evaluations, county inspectors also notified jail officials that 
safeguards to prevent inmates from abusing prescription drugs were inadequate, 
and that storage areas were so dark that staff members could easily give out 
the wrong medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Intravenous solutions were prepared in a dirty room, and contaminated waste was 
stored in the same room where inmates have dental surgery, the evaluators 
found. In addition, there were no provisions to ensure that patients with 
medically prescribed diets received the special foods they needed. 
</P>
<P>
The inspectors also criticized the Sheriff's Department for failing to maintain 
complete medical records and for failing to send medical records with inmates 
when they were transferred among the county jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Moving inmates without medical records caused excessive delays in their 
treatment for serious medical problems and sometimes prevented them from 
receiving medication on time, the inspections found. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the problems had gone uncorrected for several years, the reports said, 
although they had been outlined to jail officials in previous evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
Blanche Ross, a county health department medical programs consultant who has 
inspected the jail for several years, said the medical staff has tried to 
improve the quality of care and sanitary conditions over the last several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, the medical staff is now testing a new program to ensure 
that inmates receive their medication all the time. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross said the medical department is hampered by insufficient funding, and 
demands on the hospital are growing faster than the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"They are attempting to address those issues. It's a matter of increase in 
population without a concomitant increase in the medical staff," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The 248-bed jail hospital provides a wide range of medical services for the 
more than 21,000 inmates of the central jail and for inmates of jails in the 
county system. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates are treated in the jail hospital for a variety of serious health 
problems, including AIDS, hepatitis, diabetes, gunshot wounds and trauma. 
Patients requiring major surgery are transferred to County-USC Medical Center, 
but are returned to the jail for post-operative recovery as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has been under a court order for the last decade to 
obtain a state license for the hospital, but thus far it has not complied. In 
order to obtain such a license, the jail will have to correct the deficiencies 
identified by the state inspectors last week. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities said that they met with county jail officials this week to 
exchange information and discuss upcoming corrections to the system.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REGENTS MOVE AHEAD ON WEAPONS LAB CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UC Board of Regents voted 13 to 3 Friday to begin negotiations for renewing 
federal contracts to run two nuclear weapons laboratories. The university 
system's relationship with the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national 
laboratories has sparked strong opposition among faculty, students and peace 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
The no votes were cast by Regent Yori Wada, alumni representative Martha 
Newkirk and student representative Jenny Doh. Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, an ex 
officio regent, spoke against the laboratory contracts but left before the 
vote, which was held at UCLA. Regent Yvonne Brathwaite Burke abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's action allows university officials to begin talks with the U.S. 
Department of Energy on the renewal of the five-year contracts, which are set 
to expire in 1992. Also involved is the Lawrence Berkeley facility on the UC 
Berkeley campus, which performs federal research but no classified work.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE TRAPS SET AFTER PREGNANT MEXFLY IS 
FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County agricultural officials reported Friday the trapping of a 
pregnant Mexican fruit fly in Monrovia, sparking an intensified round of fly 
trapping and ground pesticide spraying within 200 meters of the find. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexfly was found Wednesday in a sapote tree on Grand Avenue. It is the 
first found in the county since July 23, when a single immature male fly was 
trapped in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Atkins, deputy agricultural commissioner, said no aerial spraying is 
planned. But the discovery of any additional flies could force agricultural 
officials to order the controversial aerial malathion applications, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Mediterranean fruit fly, Mexflies are considered the next most 
dangerous fruit fly to agriculture.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARSENAL SEIZED FROM FARMHOUSE; 2 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who raided a secluded boarded-up 
Lancaster farmhouse seized an arsenal of guns, grenades, an anti-tank rocket 
launcher, cans of gunpowder -- and a live rattlesnake -- authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested at the farmhouse, which investigators said may have been 
used as a drug laboratory because a small amount of methamphetamine was found. 
</P>
<P>
The rattlesnake "scared the bejesus out of me," Sgt. Jim Brent said. The snake 
was seized by animal control officers. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies found a Dragon anti-tank rocket launcher but no rockets. Among the 
other items found were a replica of an M-60 machine gun and 20 small explosive 
devices, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sundahl and Edward Coleman, both 40 and of Lancaster, were arrested on 
suspicion of possession of explosive devices and were being held in lieu of 
$70,000 bail each at the sheriff's Antelope Valley station.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JOURNALISM PROFESSOR WINS BACK ADVISER POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Cal Poly Pomona journalism professor who was removed as faculty adviser to 
the school paper after the paper printed articles critical of the school's 
administration has won his fight for reinstatement. 
</P>

David C. Henley, 54, a tenured professor, was offered his adviser job back last 
week and received a letter of apology from Cal Poly's administration. His job 
as head of the school's journalism department was unaffected by the adviser 
flap. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona officials said Henley opted not to return to the student 
newspaper until the 1991-92 school year because another adviser already had 
been hired for this year.

BOEING ADMITS BYPASSING JOBLESS AEROSPACE WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Boeing Co. on Friday confirmed complaints that it is deliberately bypassing 
unemployed local aerospace workers and instead importing temporary workers from 
Seattle to fill about 450 B-2 bomber jobs at its Palmdale plant. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing does not like hiring temporary workers who eventually must be laid off, 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a policy of only hiring permanent employees. Our temporary jobs are 
just that -- temporary," said Tom Koehler, spokesman for the Seattle-based 
aerospace company. He said Boeing's imported workers can do the temporary work 
and then return to Seattle, but new employees hired locally ultimately would be 
laid off. 
</P>
<P>
The company's response was the latest twist in the controversy over its policy 
of temporarily transfering workers from Seattle to Palmdale -- at an added cost 
to the government of $10 million per year -- even though the Los Angeles area 
has thousands of unemployed aerospace workers. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council, Mayor Tom Bradley, the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), and Rep. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City) have called on Boeing to hire jobless local aerospace 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing statement Friday is in direct opposition to previous comments by 
Boeing officials who said Boeing had been trying to find Los Angeles-area 
workers to fill the jobs, but had been unable to find enough with proper 
qualifications and security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's statement supports complaints by angry aerospace workers and 
politicians in the Los Angeles area who scoffed at Boeing's earlier claim, 
accusing the company of not aggressively seeking workers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A union official at the Lockheed Corp.'s layoff-plagued aerospace plant in 
Burbank said many unemployed Southern California aerospace workers would be 
happy to get even temporary Boeing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"If a worker has been laid off and he sees the opportunity for a $16- to 
$17-an-hour job, he'll take the aerospace job and worry about security later," 
said Don Nakamoto of the International Assn. of Machinists, which represents 
Lockheed's union employees. 
</P>
<P>
Koehler said Boeing has hired at least 100 Los Angeles-area applicants for 
permanent B-2 jobs in Palmdale since the start of the year, increasing the 
local share of its work force there to about 415 out of 866 workers. 
</P>
<P>
However, the company in recent months has not tried to hire many local workers 
for B-2 jobs in Palmdale, Koehler said. Boeing did some minor advertising for 
B-2 jobs in Palmdale, but that was halted by May, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising this year consisted of one ad for an Antelope Valley job fair 
that ran on a single day in March in the Antelope Valley Press, San Bernardino 
Sun and the Riverside Press-Enterprise, and a different ad that ran one day in 
May in the Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
Koehler said he could not explain why Boeing did not advertise the permanent 
Palmdale B-2 jobs either in the Los Angeles Times, the area's largest 
newspaper, or in the Daily News, which serves the area where Lockheed's Burbank 
plant is located, or in the Long Beach Press-Telegram, where McDonnell 
Douglas's plant is located. 
</P>
<P>
One veteran Lockheed worker, who said he applied for a Palmdale job at a job 
fair this spring and never heard back from Boeing, said he believes Boeing was 
not seriously looking. "I kind of think Boeing was here because it looked nice 
that they showed up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Requesting anonymity because he ultimately kept his job at Lockheed, the worker 
said Boeing's claim that qualified aerospace workers were hard to find in 
Southern California "rubbed about 20,000 people the wrong way."

CRANE OPERATOR INJURED IN FALL AT METRO RAIL SITE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: A WORKER SUFFERS A BROKEN ARM WHEN HE SLIPS AND PLUNGES INTO A SHAFT 
NEAR THE LOCATION OF THE JULY 13 FIRE.

<P>
A crane operator at a Metro Rail construction site was injured Friday when he 
fell 20 feet down an air shaft at the downtown subway segment that burned two 
months ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim King Jr., 21, was rushed to County-USC Medical Center, where he was treated 
for a broken right arm, dislocated right elbow and bruises, said hospital 
spokeswoman Adelaida De La Cerda. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. near the Hollywood Freeway and only about 
600 feet away from where an underground fire collapsed a 150-foot stretch of 
tunnel in July. King apparently was attempting to put some pipe down an air 
plenum -- a ventilation shaft used to circulate fresh air into the underground 
rail system -- when he slipped on a piece of plywood that gave way, plunged 20 
feet and struck the concrete below, said John-Paul White, resident engineer 
with the PDCD, a consortium that manages construction on the Metro Rail 
project. 
</P>
<P>
King was conscious and talking as paramedics placed him in a wire basket that 
was pulled to the surface by a crane, White said. It was the first serious fall 
to occur at the site, where construction is being done by the 
Tutor-Saliba-Perini joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA sent an investigator to the tunnel site to determine if any state 
safety laws had been violated, said Byron Ishkanian, head of Cal/OSHA's mining 
and tunneling division in Van Nuys. Cal/OSHA checks into all such injury 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The air shaft was on top of A-130 Right, one of two parallel tunnels that will 
carry empty trains between Union Station and a maintenance yard being built 
beside the Los Angeles River, said Clara Potes of the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, which is responsible for the design and construction 
of the Metro Rail system. 
</P>
<P>
The July 13 fire that led to the closure of a three-mile stretch of the 
Hollywood Freeway occurred in A-130 Left and about 600 feet south of where 
King's accident occurred, Potes said. Arson investigators are still trying to 
determine what caused that blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is part of a 4.4-mile, $1.4-billion first phase of construction on 
the Metro Rail project. Tutor-Saliba, which joined with the Framingham, 
Mass.-based Perini Corp. for three of its Metro Rail contracts, has been cited 
nearly 300 times for safety violations by Cal/OSHA since 1979, 9.3% of which 
were considered serious.

COUNTY TOLD TO STOP 'COERCING' WORKERS TO GIVE TO CHARITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge ordered Los Angeles County administrators Friday to stop 
"coercing and intimidating" their employees into contributing to United Way, 
the Brotherhood Crusade and other major charities that solicit in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Judge G. Keith Wisot, calling the solicitations "shameful," ruled that fund 
raising should not be conducted during business hours, but only during periods 
such as lunches, breaks and before and after work. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, another judge had issued a temporary order limiting such 
solicitations to 15 minutes during work. Wisot said, however, that the county 
had disregarded that order and that stronger measures were needed to ensure 
that employees are not harassed. 
</P>
<P>
Wisot's ruling came as a result of a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by a group of 
county employees who said during the trial that they were illegally forced to 
spend thousands of hours soliciting for the charities, instead of doing their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
They testified that they were ordered by superiors to threaten new employees 
with firing if they did not make donations, and that they were forced to attend 
fund-raising rallies on county time and perform chores such as washing dishes 
during the events. They also said supervisors' yearly bonuses depended, in 
part, on how much money they were able to raise from subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
Wisot ordered the county to cease maintaining a "hit list" of names of workers 
who declined to donate. He also instructed management to tell employees that 
participation in fund raising is voluntary and that they would suffer no 
adverse employment consequences if they did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
County administrators argued that the fund raising is legal and that the court 
has no authority to oversee its administration. Attorney Stephen Morris, who 
represented the county, disputed allegations that worker harassment was 
involved in soliciting the donations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, a total of $2.7 million was raised for charity from among the county's 
70,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon, the highest-ranking county 
administrative employee and a member of the United Way board, testified that 
the program is voluntary and that there had been no intimidation of, or 
retaliation against, workers who did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
But the plaintiffs introduced a 1987 memo in which Dixon told campaign 
coordinators: "I expect 100% participation by our employees. If there are 
exceptions to this, I will meet with you individually one week prior to the 
close of the campaign to discuss your division's lack of support." 
</P>
<P>
For years, United Way has been afforded time by government agencies and private 
firms to solicit during working hours. Employees can arrange to have weekly 
donations directly withdrawn from their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's ruling applies only to county workers.

HOLLYWOOD SIGN GETS NEW LOOK -- BRIEFLY; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARK: ARTISTS' PREDAWN OIL WAR EFFORT IS YANKED DOWN BEFORE SUN'S FIRST 
RAYS. OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE NOT AMUSED BY THE PRANK.

<P>
It's a sign that the community is still just as HOLLYWEIRD as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Ten self-proclaimed artists who stealthily crept to the HOLLYWOOD sign before 
dawn Friday to protest the continuing crisis in the Middle East slipped away 
after delivering a message that almost no one saw. 
</P>
<P>
They no sooner had draped black plastic sheeting over the 400-foot-long letters 
to make them spell out OIL WAR and then hiked to the bottom of the hill to 
admire their handiwork when Los Angeles officials delivered a message to them. 
</P>
<P>
It's HOLLYWRONG to tamper with a city landmark, said park rangers and police 
who rushed from the top of Mt. Lee to yank down the plastic covering before 
sunrise -- and before nearly anyone except Park Ranger Matt Perez on patrol 
could notice it. 
</P>
<P>
The hillside skirmish was the latest in an escalating war between pranksters 
and officials over the 68-year-old sign, which in recent years has been changed 
to read HOLLYWEED in celebration of a new marijuana law, HOLYWOOD (twice) in 
honor of Easter and visiting Pope John Paul II, OLLYWOOD for Iran-Contra's 
Oliver L. North, CALTECH for the school, GO NAVY for a football game, JOLLYWOOD 
for an airline, FOX for the television network and RAFFEYSOD for an obscure 
rock band. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the altered sign has been left in place long enough to be seen and 
snickered at by passersby. 
</P>
<P>
But this time unamused officials were downright HOLLYRUDE, according to the 
leader of the band that spent several hours draping plastic sheeting over the 
50-foot-tall letters during their ill-fated raid. 
</P>
<P>
"This was supposed to be something that would bring a question to people's 
minds as to whether or not it's really worth it to fight a battle to maintain 
inexpensive gasoline in the United States," said Danny Finegood, who organized 
Friday's sign-altering attack. 
</P>
<P>
The sign is easy to tamper with because its nine letters are enough to spell 
out plenty of other words, said Finegood, 36, a furniture maker who lives in 
Los Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Park Chief Ranger Hector Hernandez said late Friday he would like to 
spell an end to what he sees as vandalism. He said intruders have to trespass 
on posted property to reach the sign; those climbing up the steep hillside risk 
falling and hurting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Park employees sent to clean up the sign must climb onto the giant letters, 
Hernandez said. "I don't think it's funny for my men to risk their lives for 
what is supposed to be a joke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shel Jensen, assistant general manager of the city's Department of Parks and 
Recreation, said the city plans to fight back by installing a fence, a burglar 
alarm and television surveillance cameras around the sign. Among his many 
complaints, Jensen said, is that the occasional pranks draw unwanted sightseers 
into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the extensive security plan will come from a trust fund organized 
by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. The account is financed by fees paid by 
movie studios to film the famous sign and companies using it in advertising and 
on souvenir items, said chamber President Larry Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
The total now ranges somewhere between $177,000 and $277,000 -- although the 
exact amount will be determined by state auditors called in to mediate a 
dispute over the cash, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the landmark sign looms like a beacon to Finegood and his 
friends, who claim responsibility for HOLLYWEED, one of the two HOLYWOODs and 
OLLYWOOD. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood hasn't seen its last HOLLYRUSE, Finegood said. "We have more ideas. 
We'll be back. I suggest people keep their eye on the sign."

B OF A EMPLOYEES TO HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM FEWER HMOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BankAmerica Corp. said Friday that next year it will offer access to only six 
of the 15 health maintenance organizations now included in its health-care plan 
for California-based employees. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based bank holding company's decision follows similar actions 
taken by other large California employers who are drastically cutting the 
number of HMO options offered employees. They say fewer options help to cut the 
overall cost of health care and provide for better monitoring of the HMOs' 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Besides narrowing employees' choices, the trend has implications for how many 
HMOs will survive. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing its decision to employees, BankAmerica cited the $48-million 
annual cost of the HMOs. The company's success and competitive position 
required a redesign of the health-care plan to "ensure that employees and their 
family members have access to quality health care that is cost-effective and 
affordable," a company letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Those factors, as well as number of enrollees, breadth of services and 
overlapping HMOs in the same service area, helped to determine the cuts, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 3,500 of about 30,000 BankAmerica workers enrolled in HMOs will have 
to switch plans, said company spokesman Peter Magnani. The remainder of the 
company's 56,000 workers are enrolled in a traditional indemnity insurance 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The HMOs BankAmerica will keep are Kaiser Permanente Health Care Program, 
Maxicare Health Plans of Los Angeles, Woodland Hills-based Health Net, 
Sacramento-based Foundation Health Plan and the two HMO options offered by San 
Francisco-based Bridgeway Hospital. Among the plans that won't be offered next 
year are Cypress-based PacifiCare, FHP Corp. of Fountain Valley, Woodland 
Hills-based Cigna, Emeryville-based HEALS Health Plan, TakeCare of Concord and 
Santa Rosa-based Health Plan of the Redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Kaiser is the clear winner in the consolidation trend, which analysts 
say will soon become more widespread nationally. The common pattern has been 
for the companies to retain the Kaiser HMO and choose "some alternative because 
they have to have something else," said Peter Boland, a Berkeley-based 
health-care consultant. The plans that appear to be emerging as alternatives to 
Kaiser are those with statewide networks, or those that offer a broad selection 
of services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the BankAmerica situation, big winners are also Foundation and Health Net, 
said Alfred Lowey-Ball, a Sacramento-based HMO consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The HMOs that appear to be the losers in the consolidations are those that are 
in financial difficulty or have an unstable future, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Some financially troubled HMOs were dropped by BankAmerica, but it retained 
Maxicare, whose future is cloudy despite its apparent return to financial 
health after Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Industry sources said the 
retention of Maxicare was the big surprise in the selection process. The number 
of enrollees may have been a factor in Maxicare's survival as well as the 
elimination of some financially strong and stable HMOs, they said. Also, unlike 
Pacific Telesis and Wells Fargo, which also have eliminated many HMOs, 
BankAmerica did not retain any plan associated with a major insurance carrier, 
such as Cigna Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
Some other factors may have also been at work in BankAmerica's selection, some 
industry sources said. "Health Net right now appears to be offering some very 
favorable rates," said one industry source. 
</P>
<P>
Boland said BankAmerica conducted a "fairly simplified analysis." The company 
eliminated the obviously troubled HMOs and appears to have chosen the rest 
based on enrollment. "It does not appear that they looked closely at 
performance . . . This kind of analysis doesn't force the HMOs to make their 
case based on cost and performance," he said.

JUDGE WON'T LOWER $5-MILLION BAIL FOR CHARLES KEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles judge Friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for Charles H. 
Keating Jr., saying the Phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being 
indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner said Keating -- pursued by creditors, 
regulators and prosecutors for his role in the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan -- has "significant reasons not to stay around." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that the 66-year-old Keating -- a once-wealthy real estate 
developer, lawyer and influential political campaign contributor used to 
pin-striped suits -- will spend more time in blue prison fatigues inside Los 
Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Klausner reduced bail for three Keating co-defendants from 
the $1 million he imposed Tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the 
former operators of American Continental Corp. and its former main subsidiary, 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for Judy J. Wischer, 42, former American Continental president, was 
lowered to $200,000. Bail for Robin S. Symes, 37, and Ray C. Fidel, 32, both 
former Lincoln presidents, was cut to $100,000. Wischer posted bail Friday and 
was expected to be released during the night. 
</P>
<P>
The four are charged with wrongdoing in the sale of more than $200 million in 
American Continental bonds to thousands of mostly elderly Southern California 
investors. The bonds were sold through Lincoln branches, allegedly as safe and 
insured investments. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds became worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy in 
April, 1989. The next day Lincoln was declared insolvent and seized by federal 
regulators. The failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, indicated that he would appeal Klausner's 
ruling. Keating will not flee and intends to fight to clear his name, Neal 
said. But the decision denies Keating access to his attorneys and to records so 
he can mount a defense effectively, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (the decision) is unsupportable on the evidence that was introduced 
this week," Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had sought to have bail reduced to $500,000, an amount that could be 
paid by his family, Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
Neal argued that Keating, who three years ago had a net worth of nearly $40 
million, is broke. Keating's former accountant testified that his debts exceed 
his assets by $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice 
in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce 
Keating's bail. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Keating is accused of cheating people out of their savings," Reiner said 
in a press conference after the hearing. "For many of them, it was their life 
savings. And whether somebody wears an expensive suit or a cheap mask, stealing 
is stealing and both of them ought to be treated the same." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision came after 1 1/2 days of testimony and arguments in the 
first criminal case to be filed in connection with the collapses of Lincoln and 
Phoenix-based American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, unshaven and looking tired, sat impassively in the prisoners' block as 
the judge announced his decision. His co-defendants also showed little emotion 
as they were whisked away by court deputies after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Donald Smaltz, attorney for Symes, criticized Reiner and Klausner 
for their handling of the bail hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The most talked-about event in the last several weeks has been the Iraqi 
invasion," Smaltz said. "The sole thing that replaced Saddam Hussein on the 
front page was Charles Keating, and Reiner's milking that for all it's worth." 
</P>
<P>
He also struck out at the judge, saying, "He's never going to get arrested for 
flashing his Phi Beta Kappa key. Bail is supposed to assure a defendant's 
appearance in court and must be within the means he could reasonably afford." 
</P>
<P>
Klausner also said he was "troubled" by the way the district attorney has 
equivocated on the bail issue. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when the indictments were unsealed, prosecutors did not object to 
releasing all the defendants on their own recognizance. On Wednesday, 
prosecutors said they were willing to recommend a reduction in bail to $1 
million for Keating and $50,000 for the others. Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul 
W. Turley argued against reducing the bail at all. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper 
bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing 
were the most important in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the hearing, defense attorneys brought witnesses and other evidence

that the defendants would return to court for trial to fight for their 
vindication, as they had stayed to fight the massive civil litigation filed 
against them.

CRUDE OIL PRICES TOP $35 A BARREL ON WAR WORRIES; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: A SPEECH BY SADDAM HUSSEIN AND A PINCH IN FOREIGN SUPPLIES SEND 
PETROLEUM PRICES TO A RECORD HIGH AT THE N.Y. MERC.

Energy prices soared again Friday, with November crude oil futures leaping more 
than $2 a barrel to a record high above $35 on tough talk by Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein and signs of tight petroleum supplies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A barrel of West Texas Intermediate -- the U.S benchmark crude that heavily 
influences other petroleum prices -- to be delivered in November rose $2.01 a 
barrel to $35.43 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The surge in oil prices 
carried over into gasoline and home heating oil futures, which posted sharp 
gains as well. 
</P>
<P>
The closing price was another record high for the Merc, which began trading in 
oil futures in March, 1983. The previous Merc crude oil high was reached only 
on Thursday, when the price of October crude closed at $34.71. That was the 
last day of trading for October oil futures. 
</P>
<P>
The market on Friday was rattled by Hussein's speech on Iraqi television in 
which he called on his people to prepare for war, which would be bound to 
disrupt production and distribution of much of the world's oil. In a report 
issued Friday, the World Bank predicted that a Mideast war could send oil 
prices soaring to $65 a barrel this year and then remain at $30 to $40 a barrel 
during the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The thinking in the market is that a war is almost inevitable," said Andrew 
Lebow, an oil industry analyst at E. D. &amp; F. Man International Futures 
Inc., a New York brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
The growing expectation of war and uncertainty over supplies has also reduced 
the pool of sellers, who want to hold onto their oil in case shortages develop, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"A shortage mentality is beginning to creep into the market," Lebow said. 
</P>
<P>
According to traders, oil prices were also riding the momentum that pushed 
October oil up nearly $2 a barrel on Thursday. "We went out real strong (on 
October oil futures) and that cleared the path for November," said Tom Bentz, 
director of trading at United Energy, a New York trading firm. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions of a colder-than-normal winter in the Northeast and the closure of 
several Gulf of Mexico coast refineries for maintenance contributed to sizable 
price increases in gasoline and home heating oil futures. Unleaded gasoline for 
October delivery soared 5.91 cents to 97.45 cents a gallon and October heating 
oil jumped 5.35 cents to 97.21 cents a gallon. Trading in October gasoline and 
heating oil ends next week. 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers also noted that worldwide embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti 
crude oil has taken a bigger toll so far on European nations, which have bid up 
prices of crude oil, gasoline and home heating oil as they seek out new 
supplies. A major Algerian oil refinery also has been shut down for 
maintenance, further reducing the flow of refined fuel to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But Europe is not the only region feeling the petroleum pinch. "The Far East is 
becoming very, very tight for products, namely jet fuel," said Bentz at United 
Energy. "We are now starting to see the effect of the lost (Iraqi and Kuwaiti) 
products in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
If petroleum and gasoline futures prices remain at current levels, the pump 
price of regular unleaded gasoline could rise to about $1.50 or $1.60 a gallon 
in some regions, Bentz said.

Depositors withdrew a record $15.1 billion from the nation's savings and loans 
in April, the government said Friday in another confirmation of the rapid 
retrenchment gripping the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The net withdrawal, which was somewhat offset by $2.9 billion in interest 
credited to savers' accounts, reduced deposits at the 2,839 S&amp;Ls to $916 
billion, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record of $13.4 billion was set three months earlier. Before that, 
the record was $10.8 billion set in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the outflow, the 22nd in 23 months, primarily to the need 
to meet stiff capital standards imposed by last year's S&amp;L bailout law, 
among other reasons.

Saunders Lodges Appeal Against Sentence: Ernest Saunders, former chairman of 
Guinness PLC, and stockbroker Anthony Parnes will appeal their convictions for 
fraudulently engineering Guinness' takeover of a Scottish distiller, lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders, 54, and Parnes, 44, were sentenced to prison time for their parts in 
a scheme to boost Guinness stock during the company's $5.26-billion takeover of 
Distillers Ltd. in 1986. Lawyers for Gerald Ronson, who was also sentenced, 
said he was also considering an appeal. A fourth man convicted, Sir Jack Lyons, 
74, was freed on bail so he could undergo surgery.

Soviets Close Pizza Hut: A dispute over jurisdiction between the Kievsky 
regional council and the Moscow city council has resulted in the closure of one 
of the two Pizza Hut restaurants that opened with great fanfare 10 days ago, a 
restaurant official said. "We apologize to our customers for the temporary 
closure by the Soviet authorities of our restaurant," said a sign posted on the 
door of the flagship Moscow Pizza Hut on Kutuzovsky Prospect, about a mile from 
the Kremlin. Andrew Rafalat, deputy general director of the joint venture 
running the Soviet Pizza Huts, said he could not disclose the specific reason 
for the shutdown.

ECONOMIST LOSES A POST AFTER TV COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An economist well known for his pessimistic warnings about the financial health 
of the banking industry said Friday that he has been ousted from a non-paying 
position at a Stanford research center because of controversial comments he 
made on ABC's "Nightline" program. 
</P>
<P>
R. Dan Brumbaugh said the decision by administrators at Stanford's Center for 
Economics Policy Research stemmed from comments he made on a July 31 appearance 
on the program with Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William 
Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
In that appearance, Brumbaugh said that the banking deposit insurance fund is 
weak, and that taxpayers are at risk to pay for bank failures. His most 
controversial remark, which received the most attention, was that several of 
the nation's largest banks are actually insolvent. Seidman, on the program, 
called Brumbaugh's remarks "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Brumbaugh said that after the appearance, officials with the Stanford center 
canceled a banking project he was to head and cut off his affiliation. 
Brumbaugh said he believes that the center was under pressure from banking 
executives who contribute to Stanford, and Bush Administration officials, 
several of whom used to be affiliated with the center. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Steinmueller, deputy director of the center, denied Brumbaugh's 
allegations. He said the idea of the banking project was not pursued because 
members of Stanford's faculty were not interested in it, and that the center's 
role is to aid their research. 
</P>
<P>
Brumbaugh, one of the first to warn about the saving and loan mess, is 
frequently quoted in the news media. Even though he had no official job with 
Stanford, he is frequently identified incorrectly as an economist or professor 
with the university. 
</P>
<P>
Steinmueller described Brumbaugh's title of senior research scholar as a 
"courtesy title" given to him. He said that Brumbaugh's main task at the center 
was to organize a banking conference earlier this year.

MERCURY S&amp;L IS ACQUIRED BY SECURITY PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp. said Friday that it has acquired the 24 branches and 
some of the assets of Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, the insolvent thrift based in 
Huntington Beach that was seized earlier this year by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based bank holding company paid $44.4 million to acquire $1.4 
billion of Mercury's deposits, $330 million of its assets and its offices -- 
including five branches in Orange County and 12 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp. retains $1.2 billion of Mercury's assets, which 
consist largely of multiple family residential loans and commercial loans. The 
RTC provided Security Pacific with $859 million to cover the difference between 
the liabilities and assets it assumed. 
</P>
<P>
RTC spokeswoman Kate Spears said the resolution of Mercury ultimately will cost 
the taxpayers $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry A. Grundhofer, president and chief executive of Security Pacific National 
Bank, said the company acquired Mercury because the thrift -- crippled by a 
change in federal accounting rules for S&amp;Ls and some bad commercial loans 
-- fit well with its existing customer base. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury was taken over by regulators Feb. 23, after a $40-million loss for 1989 
drove it into insolvency. It since has been run by RTC.

SAUDIS PULL OUT STOPS TO BOLSTER OIL OUTPUT; 
</P>
<P>
PETROLEUM: FACILITIES MOTHBALLED BACK IN THE MID-1980S ARE BEING REACTIVATED TO 
BRING PRODUCTION BACK TO PEAK LEVELS IF NEEDED.

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is working flat out to reactivate oil facilities mothballed during 
the mid-1980s and could bring output back to peak levels of 10 million barrels 
a day within a year if needed, industry sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Oil executives and analysts said that Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil 
exporter, would have to revert to less sophisticated production techniques to 
pump the extra 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day of crude oil but that 
the country wants to be able to do so if the Persian Gulf crisis escalates. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already started de-mothballing and are moving ahead as quickly as 
possible so that in a year we could produce everything the market may want," a 
Saudi oil source said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do it unless we have to because it would be like a car going 
uphill -- but if necessary, we could go back to 10 million barrels per day 
within a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has already boosted wellhead output by nearly 50% to nearly 8 
million barrels per day to help compensate world markets for the loss of around 
4 million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. 
</P>
<P>
This level, dubbed the "surge capacity," is not sustainable. But oil industry 
sources say state-owned Saudi Aramco is taking steps to make it so within six 
to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which has 25% of the world's known oil reserves, favors keeping 
oil prices moderate to ensure long-term demand for its most precious commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, has threatened to destroy Persian Gulf 
oil fields -- the richest in the world -- if it is attacked by foreign forces 
massing in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices hit nine-year highs this week on fears of war in the area and as the 
absence of embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude began taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
Persian Gulf analysts say Saudi Arabia is doing everything it can to calm the 
jittery market. It raised production two weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait but 
waited for an agreement among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
last month before selling the extra oil. 
</P>
<P>
"If war broke out and fields in the north of the country were damaged, they 
would want to pick up production from other fields," said one Western oil 
analyst based in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they could rehabilitate the old fields within a year, but they would 
have to go back to production techniques they used in the early 1980s," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi oil sources said the country would have to start burning off natural gas 
produced with the oil as it did in the early 1980s and would be pumping mainly 
heavy crude if it raised output quickly.

Blue chip stocks ended modestly lower Friday after a day of volatile, heavy 
trading caused largely by computer-driven programs and the expiration of 
certain stock options and stock index futures. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 5.94 points to 2,512.38. For the week, the 
widely watched Dow was off 51.73, or 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 595 up, 928 down and 471 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume surged to 201.05 million shares, the busiest day since Aug. 
23. A total of 145.10 million shares traded Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The market remained under heavy pressure, burdened by another sharp spike in 
the price of crude oil and a selloff in the bond market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
November crude oil rose $2.01 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing at a 
nine-year high of $35.43 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a nasty day and a nasty week," said Alfred Goldman, director of 
technical research at A. G. Edwards. "There's going to be more selling on 
Monday because we're going out negative for the week." 
</P>
<P>
Investors, paralyzed by Mideast tensions and worries about the U.S. economy, 
got a fresh dose of grim news when Chase Manhattan Bank announced that it will 
charge $1 billion against third-quarter earnings, lay off 5,000 people and cut 
its dividend in half. 
</P>
<P>
Chase's troubles underscore the deepening concerns about the nation's banking 
system, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to see how a banking system is going to respond to any help from the 
Federal Reserve under these conditions," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chase's announcement may have helped bring the Dow index off its lows 
by alleviating rampant speculation about the bank and its prospects, said Dean 
Witter chief technical analyst Phil Roth. 
</P>
<P>
"After that (Chase's announcement) happened, the market breathed a little sigh 
of relief. It cleared the air," Roth said. In addition, late option expirations 
leaned toward the buy side, boosting blue chips slightly. 
</P>
<P>
But additional selling might strike stocks next week as investors do some 
"reverse window dressing" at the end of the quarter, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll have to expect some window dressing, but it might take the form 
of selling," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson agreed, saying portfolio managers will be reluctant to show large 
equity positions after the stock market's dismal performance this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Among market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Chase Manhattan fell 1 to 12 3/4. Other bank shares also turned in weak 
performances. Manufacturers Hanover fell 2 7/8 to 23, Citicorp dropped 7/8 to 
15 3/4 and Chemical Banking slipped 7/8 to 16 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Scott Paper fell 6 7/8 to 34 3/8 as analysts lowered earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
* Milton Roy shot up 3 3/4 to 26 3/4. Sundstrand Corp. said it entered into a 
definitive agreement to merge with the technical instrument maker for $28 a 
share, or $128 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Corroon &amp; Black fell 1 5/8 to 29 1/4 after Aon Corp. withdrew its 
$40-a-share bid, which was rejected by the ball bearing maker. 
</P>
<P>
* Among top performers in the oil sector were Murphy Oil Corp., up 1 1/2 to 47 
3/8; Mobil Corp., up 1 1/4 to 67, and Atlantic Richfield, up 7/8 to 140 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors dropped 1/4 to 36 5/8, 
International Business Machines 1 1/8 to 106 3/4, Philip Morris 1/4 to 44 3/4 
and Boeing 5/8 to 43 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* On the plus side, General Electric rose 3/4 to 55 7/8, and American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph gained 7/8 to 31 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks closed with a slight gain Friday, helped by window dressing by 
financial institutions on the last day of trading for September delivery. The 
225-share Nikkei index gained 174.85 points to close at 23,777.83. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended higher and at the day's peaks on London's Stock Exchange. 
The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 8.6 points at 2,025.5. 
</P>
<P>
West German shares swung widely in volatile trading, with the 30-share DAX

The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 3/4 point, or $7.50 per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, climbed to 9.11% from 
9.03% late Thursday.

Rising prices for crude oil since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait have 
intensified the bond market's concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation carries a double threat for bonds: It erodes their value, and it 
lessens the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will allow interest rates to 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders have been hoping that the Fed would nudge rates lower because that 
would move bond prices higher. But the surge in oil prices has dampened those 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said credit markets were also shaken Friday by word that Democratic 
congressional leaders would probably try to delay federal budget cuts beyond 
the Oct. 1 Gramm-Rudman deadline while talks on the deficit continue. 
</P>
<P>
Volume was light Friday as many traders took the day off for Rosh Hashanah, the 
Jewish New Year. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.125%, up from 8.063% late Thursday. 
</P>

CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Gives British Pound a Drubbing 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against most currencies, moving up sharply against the British 
pound on speculation that Britain's entry into Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism 
will take place later rather than sooner. 
</P>
<P>
It fell against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the activity in the market today centered on sterling," said Robert 
Hatcher at Barclays Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said activity was subdued ahead of a meeting of finance officials from 
the Group of Seven industrialized nations Saturday and next week's annual 
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The pound fell against the dollar to $1.8435 from $1.8845 after steadying 
briefly on Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's statement that Britain will 
enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism at the "earliest sensible date." Britain is 
waiting for the right circumstances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency bought 1.5785 German marks, up from 1.5770 late Thursday, but 
it eased to 136.65 Japanese yen from 137.65. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Finstrom of Shearson Lehman Bros. said Major's statement was important 
because it underscored the fact that the question is one of timing. 
</P>
<P>
But she said speculators who were betting on an entry this autumn overlooked 
the fact that British inflation, at more than 10%, is too high to permit 
near-term entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
That entry would permit the pound to fluctuate in a certain band relative to 
other European currencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Prices of Gold Futures Level Off 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices remained relatively stable, despite soaring energy prices, 
amid skepticism that hostilities would escalate in the Middle East over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodities markets, livestock futures rose, pork bellies fell, 
soybean futures fell, and corn and wheat futures posted slight gains. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled 20 cents to 50 cents higher on New York's Commodity 
Exchange, with the contract for delivery in September at $389.40 an ounce. 
Silver settled 1 cent to 1.2 cents higher, with September at $4.79 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold posted early gains of nearly $5 an ounce in sympathy with surging energy 
prices, but traders later began selling off the futures for profit, analysts 
said.

TRITON'S PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS SOLD TO SCHERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Triton Biosciences Inc. said Friday that its pharmaceuticals business will be 
sold to Schering AG, a Berlin-based pharmaceuticals company with worldwide 
marketing that is trying to increase its presence in biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda-based Triton, a unit of Houston-based Shell Oil Co., is not strictly a 
biotechnology company, but much of its research and development is based on 
biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
It does not yet have a product on the market, but Schering cited Triton's 
promising drugs under development as a reason it agreed to the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Triton will keep its diagnostic testing business. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but analysts said Shell had been 
seeking at least $200 million. Schering said it will make payments to Shell 
based on the commercial success of two Triton products under development. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended approval 
of Triton's biotechnology-based cancer chemotherapy drug Fludara IV. The 
company is ready to submit for FDA approval its Betaseron drug for the 
treatment of multiple sclerosis and various types of cancer, said Janice 
Wohltmann, vice president of Triton's pharmaceuticals business. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons Schering was interested. This gives them the 
opportunity to develop an oncology (cancer treatment) business. It gives us an 
opportunity to develop our drugs worldwide. Because we are a small company, we 
have focused on the U.S. and Canada," Wohltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
By combining its traditional research and development in Germany with Triton's 
biotechnology approaches, Schering said it "expects to make cancer therapeutics 
available to patients more rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
The Triton purchase is Schering's second biotechnology purchase in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. In May, it bought South San Francisco-based Codon.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD OFFICIALS PUSH SISTER CITY IN 
SOUTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to ease tensions between black residents of Inglewood and Korean 
merchants, city officials have proposed a sister city relationship between 
Inglewood and Kyongju in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent met with Korean merchants earlier this year to 
air complaints from residents who say the merchants often treat them with 
disrespect. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Korean business community responded that cultural 
differences and a fear of crime, not racism, caused problems between the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not enemies," said Bob Lee, an assistant to Vincent. "Inglewood 
residents who go to Korea will meet Koreans and learn what they're like." 
</P>
<P>
Kyongju has agreed to the sister city relationship, although the proposal has 
not yet been presented to the Inglewood City Council or its Sister City 
Committee, officials said.

BOARD MAY ATTEMPT TO PROTECT FARMLAND

<P>
County officials may create a trust to help preserve farmland that is being 
lost to development throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the Board of Supervisors will consider setting up an advisory 
committee to study how an agricultural land trust can be established. 
</P>
<P>
The interest in forming a trust came out of a 1989 report from the Beyond the 
Year 2000 Advisory Committee. The report to the supervisors recommended forming 
a trust to preserve both agricultural and open land. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said it is important to preserve the agricultural industry that 
has dominated the county's history, Planner Gene Kjellberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the committee said land should be preserved for aesthetic reasons and to 
maintain the lifestyle of residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We are indeed losing agricultural land in the cities and in the unincorporated 
areas," Kjellberg said. 
</P>
<P>
A trust could preserve the land in several ways, he said, depending on how it 
is set up. One way is to provide farmers with economic incentives to maintain 
their land for agricultural use. It could also mean using donations, grants or 
possibly tax money to purchase land or the development rights to it. 
</P>
<P>
In the report to the supervisors, Kjellberg recommends setting up an 11-member 
advisory committee, including elected officials, agricultural experts and 
county residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Agricultural lands are the most immediately threatened with development 
because they are located in closest proximity to existing urban areas and 
available urban services," he said in his report. JANE HULSE

<P>
Oxnard Management and Budget Director Bill Mayer announced his resignation 
Friday to become head administrative officer for Mono County in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer will leave Oxnard on Oct. 19 to replace Glenn Thompson, who recently 
resigned to become the city manager of Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer, 46, has worked in Oxnard for 8 1/2 years. He has more than 20 years of 
experience in government, including working for county governments in San 
Diego, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer earns about $67,000 a year plus benefits in Oxnard, but he declined to 
discuss his new salary, saying his contract has not been approved by Mono 
County officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new position is expected to pay less, Mayer said he accepted the 
position as a career advancement. He said he will enjoy living in the rural 
setting. HUGO MARTIN

PRIOR ARRESTS ADDED TO FRAUD COMPLAINT

<TEXT>
<P>
An alleged con artist who claimed to be the hemophilic son of an Air Force 
colonel wounded in the Panama invasion would be ineligible for probation if he 
is convicted on 12 counts of fraud under an amended criminal complaint, which a 
judge approved Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kenneth R. Yegan approved a prosecutor's 
motion to add records of felony arrests in California and four other states to 
the complaint against David Michael Murray, 31 -- alias Shi Stone, 17-year-old 
high school student. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Roberts said records of these crimes by Murray will 
be added to the complaint: a conviction for fraudulent use of a credit card in 
Idaho in 1977; vehicle taking in Ventura in 1980; theft of property under 
$10,000 in Randall County, Tex., in 1981 and retaliation against a witness in 
that case and a federal charge of interstate transport of a stolen vehicle from 
Florida to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Murray defrauded Ken and Dorothy Johnson of Ojai of room and 
board expenses and bilked an Ojai pharmacist out of $1,600 worth of a blood 
coagulant to treat his hemophilia. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged in Ventura with two counts of grand theft for stealing a bicycle 
and taking services from a dentist, three counts of petty theft and four counts 
of defrauding an innkeeper. Murray is in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $50,000 
bond. A trial is scheduled for Nov. 5. MACK REED

SAUDI ARABIA MAY REJECT COMIC BOOKS SENT TO GULF FORCES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some American heroes are just not welcome in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of a comic book store in Thousand Oaks sent 700 books featuring some 
of America's favorite super-heroes earlier this week to cheer up U.S. forces 
stationed in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
But scantily dressed heroines such as Wonder Woman probably will not make it 
through customs. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything is mailed to Saudi Arabia it must adhere to their regulations," 
said Linda Wadley, public affairs specialist at the Construction Battalion 
Center in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
And in a country in which the women wear veils and do not bare their legs or 
arms, Wonder Woman, decked out in a flashy costume not much bigger than a 
swimsuit, is considered pornographic. 
</P>
<P>
Pornography, pork products, religious items and alcohol are not permitted to 
enter Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
And advertisements for alcohol and lingerie are off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Cohen-Ross, owner of Pantechnicon comic book store, is accustomed to a 
little opposition to his sexy super-heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest problem comes from moms who think the heroines don't wear enough 
clothing," he said. "But none of this stuff is pornographic. And I ask them, 
which one's better, letting their kids read comic books or letting them watch 
violence on T.V.?" 
</P>
<P>
Cohen-Ross said he sent the books because many of his customers are in the 
service and it's his way of saying thanks. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 Seabees are already in Saudi Arabia, Wadley said, and about 1,800 
more have been given their orders to go, but she could not say when they will 
be on their way. MAJA RADEVICH

A woman who offered to help a stranger Friday found herself robbed of $5,000, 
Santa Paula police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Gary D. Marshall said a heavyset woman in a black dress approached the 
victim about 11:15 a.m. at Main and 8th streets, saying she was new to the 
country and needed help finding a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name Marshall said was not available, agreed to help the 
woman, but said she first had to do some banking at a nearby Santa Paula 
Savings branch. 
</P>
<P>
When the two women reached the bank's entrance, a well-dressed man confronted 
the victim, Marshall said. He told her that he had a handgun in his pocket and 
would kill her if she did not accompany him into the bank and make a 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who never displayed a weapon, stood at the woman's side as the teller 
handed her $5,000 in $50 bills. Neither bank customers nor the teller suspected 
anything was amiss because the woman remained calm, Marshall said. The man and 
woman, described as both Latino and appearing to be in their 40s, left the 
victim unharmed. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

13 COUNTERFEIT CARMENS COMPETE FOR THE RIGHT TO MOST-LIKE-MIRANDA TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gino Valley is convinced his hairy, bulging stomach and sorely misplaced fake 
eyelash lost him the Carmen Miranda look-alike contest. 
</P>
<P>
But the judges found the outfit Valley threw together on a dare Friday was just 
not spicy enough to beat Linda Colon, whose conga moves, they said, could have 
shaken the fruit off a banana tree. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been asking me what am I doing wearing clothes like this, that I 
must be nuts," said Valley, 59, of Ventura who admitted that he had had a few 
drinks before hitting Ventura thrift shops for the components of his outfit. "I 
can't argue with them." 
</P>
<P>
The look-alike contest held in Mission Park to the rhythm of a salsa band 
kicked off this weekend's Ventura Music Celebration. It drew 13 contestants, 
including a Christian minister, a woman trying out her Halloween costume and 
another who stole the plastic fruit on her headdress from her mother's dinner 
table. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a Portuguese fruit merchant, Maria de Carmo Miranda da Cunha is 
one of the most widely impersonated celebrities after Elvis Presley. Her 
popular nightclub act led to several movie roles in the 1940s. She died at age 
46 of a heart attack after an energetic performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always looking for fun, and any time it's good, clean, nonfattening and 
moral fun, I'll go for it," said Effie Kratz of Port Hueneme, who won two 
tickets to an upcoming Brazilian Ball at the Ventura Theatre for best ankle 
straps. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore minister Annette Sula-Goff, 40, said friends talked her into 
participating and made her costume that could have won a prize for least 
revealing, covering all but her shoulders and ankles. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with that, I was still a little iffy about the whole thing," Sula-Goff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the $250 main prize, judges awarded tickets to the Brazilian Ball 
for best headdress, fanny wrap, ruffled skirt, platform shoes, biggest earrings 
and longest eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis LaRochelle, president of the Downtown Ventura Assn., admitted that he 
and the other judges who unanimously chose Colon were slightly handicapped 
since they had no photographs of Miranda to use for comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what the parts of the costume should look like," LaRochelle said. "She 
had it all together, with maybe a little less costume on." 
</P>
<P>
Topped by a hat covered with Miranda's signature fruit, Colon's outfit included 
a lace-ruffled red tube top, brief shorts and a saucy half skirt. 
</P>
<P>
"She seemed to be the wild Carmen Miranda, putting it all out," said Dr. Tere 
Monzon, a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Colon, 33, of Camarillo, said she entered mainly to attract "some single guys 
who might like a feisty girl." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has a suppressed desire to be something they're not," Colon said. 
"Beneath this glitter and glamour, there really is an old-fashioned girl."

For years, John and Gracie Davis, both 67, of Glendale coveted a Cadillac, a 
symbol that they had "made it" in the world. 
</P>
<P>
But they say their dream of luxury travel turned into a nightmare when they 
finally purchased a new Cadillac El Dorado in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
After only 1,200 miles, the car's computer -- which controlled everything from 
the speedometer to the headlights to engine functions -- began to malfunction. 
Since then the car has been in the shop for serious repairs 22 times, the 
Davises said, with each visit lasting two to four days. At the moment, the car 
is in the shop, with its engine totally dismantled, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't get in the car. It's a hazard," Gracie Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Davises were among more than a dozen frustrated General Motors customers 
with pending lawsuits against the company who gathered outside its Van Nuys 
plant Friday morning to vent their anger. Some of the protesters, such as the 
Davises, have filed individual lawsuits against the company; others were 
plaintiffs in a class-action suit filed Thursday that contends General Motors 
does not honor the California "lemon law."

"This is my first demonstration ever in 67 years, but this car has got me that 
mad," John Davis, a retired computer engineer, said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the lemon law, enacted in 1982, a car buyer is entitled to a new car or a 
refund -- less depreciation -- from the manufacturer if, during the first year 
or the first 12,000 miles of driving, a specific problem cannot be repaired 
after four attempts or if the car is out of service for more than 30 days due 
to mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
The law is administered by the New Motor Vehicle Board. 
</P>
<P>
To receive the refund or exchange, a motorist must notify the manufacturer in 
writing of the failure of an authorized dealer to make repairs and the matter 
is then referred to an arbitrator chosen by the manufacturer. Decisions can be 
appealed by consumers to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Norman F. Taylor said General Motors does not comply with the 
regulation, and he has filed a class-action lawsuit against the company in Los 
Angeles Superior Court seeking damages on behalf of three buyers he said have 
been cheated out of their full refunds. 
</P>
<P>
When customers try to obtain new vehicles, he said, GM fights them "with 
tooth-and-nail tactics," leading to lengthy litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he told one of the plaintiffs in his class-action suit not to 
bother with arbitration because he said it was rigged to favor the car 
manufacturer and to cheat the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ott, GM's director of media relations, denied that the company ignores 
customers' complaints or tries to skirt the state lemon law. He said the 
company's top priority is consumer satisfaction, and that they have an 
arbitration process that allows purchasers to get refunds or replacement 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make them happy with their vehicles," Ott said. "We will do 
everything we can to assist them." 
</P>
<P>
He refused to discuss the complaints or other specific cases. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department of Consumer Affairs said statistics on complaints about GM 
cars and lemon-law compliance were unavailable Friday because of a staff 
shortage. A spokeswoman for the Bureau of Automotive Repair said the lemon law 
itself, with its strict rules on timing, notice and documentation, prevents 
some disgruntled consumers from receiving new cars or full refunds. 
</P>
<P>
The Davises, however, said they cannot get even the basic services promised in 
their warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Their contract promises that Cadillac will pay any car-rental costs the Davises 
incur while the car is in the shop for repairs, but the Davises say they have 
been unable to collect that money. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they said, all they want is a refund so they can buy another car from 
another company. 
</P>
<P>
"After this experience, I wouldn't want a Cadillac if you told me I could have 
two of them for free," Gracie Davis said.

AROUND THE VALLEY: SEX AND FASHION OF HISTORIC NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Padilla, Steve Padilla is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enter, if you will, into a bygone era of fashion, a time of bonnets and 
bloomers, bustles and bosom amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Your guide is Delores Heller, the 76-year-old former costume supervisor of the 
Kern County Museum in Bakersfield. Heller, after 45 years as a bookkeeper, 
decided 16 years ago to turn her lifelong interest in sewing into a new 
vocation. 
</P>
<P>
She has become an expert in textiles and has delivered more than 600 lectures 
on the history of dress. Her topic: 
</P>
<P>
"The History of Fashion, With an Accent on Women's Undergarments." 
</P>
<P>
This week Heller addressed the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society, a 
cheery group of local preservationists who restore historic buildings and 
collect artifacts reflecting the valley's rich frontier past. 
</P>
<P>
Heller last addressed the society in 1983 and was asked back by popular demand. 
She was almost as popular as the society's programs on the St. Francis Dam 
Disaster, which swept more than 600 victims to their deaths in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Even in history, sex and violence sells. 
</P>
<P>
Seated on metal folding chairs at the society's headquarters in the century-old 
Saugus Train Station, 38 listeners heard Heller chronicle the fickle course of 
fashion. She was dressed as a bloomer girl, circa 1910, in black bloomers, 
white middy blouse and black hose. 
</P>
<P>
Only her gray Nikes placed her in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more intriguing items she pulled from four suitcases packed with 
chemises, petticoats and step-ins was a bosom amplifier. The women in the 
audience, many dressed in jeans, baggy sweaters and sweat shirts, winced 
slightly as Heller held up the device. 
</P>
<P>
The bosom amplifiers, as the name implies, were intended to increase the 
prominence of cleavage. Worn in the late 1800s, they were wrapped tightly about 
the lower chest, collecting what nature had contributed into a more 
dramatically centralized location (foreshadowing Frederick's of Hollywood by a 
half-dozen generations). 
</P>
<P>
"They had gadgets for everything," Heller observed, deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
The amplifier was not much to look at, at least while not in use. It was just a 
band of cloth, much like another garment with the exact opposite function. 
</P>
<P>
"One extreme to the other," Heller said of the whims of fashion. "If in the 
'20s you had a breast, they put a bandeau on you." 
</P>
<P>
A bandeau, which squeezed the breasts flat, was worn during the Flapper Era, 
making women look like Peter Pan. "If you had anything growing, they put you in 
a bandeau," Heller said. The audience chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
Along with her audience, Heller was clearly amused by the fashions of 
yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
How could women put up with such things? Everyone asked themselves that 
question once or twice that night. 
</P>
<P>
But Heller also appreciates some of the values which helped create the fashions 
which seem so silly today. Consider the calash, a large bonnet often worn in 
the morning. Looking like the top of an old baby carriage, the calash 
surrounded the face. 
</P>
<P>
The audience giggled as she donned her calash and playfully pulled the 
drawstring up and down, making it look like her head was stuck in a bellows. 
But from head-on, it was supposed to create a flattering effect. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worn in the morning," she explained, "to frame a woman's face, which 
always makes a woman more attractive." 
</P>
<P>
She then broke the magic by noting that Marie Antoinette wore a calash. Look 
where it got her. 
</P>
<P>
As she displayed garment after garment, it appeared Heller was not speaking so 
much about fashion as the enslavement of women. Consider the layers of fabric 
encasing a woman at the turn of the century: a long chemise, a tight corset, 
drawers, up to four petticoats and, finally, a dress, generally to the ankles. 
</P>
<P>
Even at rest, a woman was condemned to a fashion-inspired bondage. A woman's 
nightshirt covered everything from ankle to neckline. A man's nightshirt 
stopped at the knees and had a slight slit for ease of movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that was not equal rights," Heller said, holding up nightshirts for each 
sex. When women finally demanded the vote and sought their rights, they may 
have had nightshirts on their minds, she hinted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where I feel the equal rights thing started." 
</P>
<P>
But Heller also indicated a slight sense of nostalgia for the days when her 
bloomer girl outfit was considered a liberated innovation. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes, even the silly ones, were often beautiful, lovingly detailed with 
embroidery and lace. 
</P>
<P>
Will future generations say as much for Jordache and L.A. Gear? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, everything a women did in those days -- it was handwork -- was 
beautifully done," Heller said. 
</P>
<P>
She held up a white petticoat with bands of lace and crochet. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my gosh," blurted out a girl in the audience. "That's pretty."

WOMAN ON PATROL; 
</P>
<P>
A VOLUNTEER POLICE OFFICER CAN'T RESIST THE CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANITA M. CAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years ago Sheri Dillon donned a uniform as a volunteer police officer for 
the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
As much as she had prepared for emergencies during an intensive training course 
at the Rio Hondo Police Reserve Academy, she was still fairly green on the July 
morning when a radio call reported a speeding sports car and she and her 
training partner were dispatched to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time she realized the dangers surrounding her new voluntary 
job, and although it has been years, she spoke about it recently as if it had 
happened yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pursuing a car, a Datsun 280-Z, that had two women in it," Dillon 
said. "They were speeding and as they turned the corner at Olive and Victory 
they hit a telephone pole and crashed. The car burned right in front of me." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't ever forget about" something like that, she said. "That's the hard 
part of police work, readjusting and trying to go home and live a normal life." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon is the only woman among 19 reserve officers on the Burbank force. Being 
the only female is something Dillon is used to. She was the only girl in a 
family of four children. She is also the only woman on the security police 
force at Burbank Airport, where she works full time. 
</P>
<P>
She added that many women may not be attracted to law enforcement because it is 
usually not presented as a career option when they're younger. Young women also 
get little experience working with mostly male groups and are subjected less 
often to the tough discipline that young men receive in sports and military 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"Women grow up and we don't go through football training or have coaches 
yelling at us," she said. "We're put on pedestals and told to look pretty. But 
going through the academy it's regimented and there are no excuses. You do it 
or you don't." 
</P>
<P>
Her colleagues don't treat her with kid gloves, which is the way she wants it. 
</P>
<P>
"They treat me with respect and I deal with them honestly," she said. "I don't 
think they've ever been intimidated by it. I think they like me for it." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon became a volunteer police officer almost by accident. She walked into 
the Burbank station eight years ago seeking a job, perhaps driving a vehicle or 
working in the jail. But when she was handed an application to try out for the 
reserves, she couldn't resist the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what I was getting into," said Dillon, who described herself as 
being very athletic and competitive as a youth. "But I thought maybe it'd turn 
into a career. I didn't think about the action or the danger, that's not what I 
went into it for." 
</P>
<P>
Two people who do think about the dangers of the job are Dillons' sons -- 
Jeffrey, 13, and Scott, 9 -- who both object to her work. Dillon, a single 
mother, said allaying their fears is her biggest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"My oldest boy says I'm crazy for being an officer," she said. "He doesn't want 
me out there at all. He's totally against it." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon, who has never used her gun while on duty, said the danger "really 
doesn't hit you until you're out there on the streets," and it's something she 
avoids thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
But danger is a part of the job, according to Lt. Tom Johnston of the Sheriff 
Department's reserve forces bureau, which trains some Burbank reserves. "We've 
had some reserves injured and we've had some killed in the line of duty," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reserves have been a part of the Burbank Police Department since 1955. Their 
purpose is to assist regular police officers with patrol duty, help out during 
natural disasters and provide the department with additional staffing when 
needed. They are not paid, but do receive a stipend to cover the cost of 
keeping their uniforms clean. 
</P>
<P>
Although volunteers, reserves carry guns and have the same powers of arrest, 
search and seizure as regular officers. The differences between a reserve and a 
regular officer are few, said Sgt. Mike Keeffe, who has been with the Burbank 
Police Department for 13 years and has supervised the reserves for the past 
three. 
</P>
<P>
"If a regular officer is off duty and sees an infraction, he can intervene," 
Keeffe explained. "But a reserve cannot act as an officer once they are off 
duty, nor are they allowed to carry a gun" while off duty. 
</P>
<P>
Reserves must pass the same stringent background checks as regular officers. In 
addition, they put in about 340 hours of academy training and more than 200 
hours in the field. Regular officers get about twice that much training. 
</P>
<P>
After passing all the background checks and making it through the academy, 
reserves must work a mandatory minimum of eight hours a month. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an easy process, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of stress," she said. "I had to maintain a regular job, take 
care of my children and my household, then study after work." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon said she was driven by determination. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really tough, but I wanted it so badly that I just put everything out 
of my mind and did it." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Russ Jordan, a 16-year veteran reserve, said Dillon is a good partner to 
have. He remembers when she backed him up in a fistfight five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She just jumped in and did the job," he said. Dillon said the reserves have 
given her life a sense of direction. If she has any regrets, it's that she did 
not enlist earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could do it all over again, because if I was 18 I'd go right into it, 
instead of waiting," she said. "I love it."

COUNCIL CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times quotes Councilman Hal Bernson as saying that Mayor 
Bradley is "sticking his nose in my district" by condemning the restrictions 
placed on the design of a Granada Hills mosque. Councilman Bernson has once 
again displayed the incredible arrogance that has come to characterize his 
entire term of office. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take a constitutional scholar to see that there is a very good 
likelihood that the City Council has infringed upon the religious freedom of 
the Muslim community by dictating the design of their place of worship. 
</P>
<P>
I was taught to believe that every American has the right to choose his or her 
own religion and not to be persecuted for that choice. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley has done the right thing by asking the Cultural Affairs 
Commission to get in on the act. With their help in developing guidelines for 
designing religious buildings, perhaps events such as this will not occur 
again. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Bernson's district, I apologize to the members of the Islamic 
Center of Northridge for the insolence and lack of sensitivity displayed by our 
councilman. Although you may have disagreements with your neighbors in Granada 
Hills, I am sure you can work these out over time. 
</P>
<P>
We do not persecute people because of their religious beliefs in this country, 
in spite of what Hal Bernson might think.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC USE OF PRIME LAND MUST COME BEFORE PRIVATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI ORTEGA, Geri Ortega is the chairman of the Huntington Beach Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California coastal communities are continually caught in a tug-of-war between 
protecting a natural resource and exploiting one. With population increasing 
and available land decreasing, the pressures on local governments are 
formidable. 
</P>
<P>
The leasing of public lands for commercial uses adds money to local city 
coffers, but the price is paid by everyone whose natural resources are 
diminished. The heart of the conflict is land-use and who makes the decisions. 
At issue is the conversion of public land to private use. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach is a perfect example. Since 1986, the city has been embroiled 
in civil war over a proposed "Pierside Village" commercial development on 
beachfront property just south of the Huntington Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle over this property dates back to 1932 when the city sued 
landowners for the beachfront property. A settlement granted the city public 
access and a beach recreation easement, leaving title held by private interests 
and the city steward for the public trust. Since then, much of the sandy beach 
and bluff top was paved over for parking and concessions; restrooms and showers 
were added. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the city, looking for a spark to ignite downtown 
redevelopment, proposed massive commercial building on its beachfront that 
would reopen the door to its development. "Pierside Village" was approved, but 
coastal permits have since expired and the project is up for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
The State Lands Commission and the attorney general's office, reluctant to see 
public land converted to a private use, resisted the city's efforts to clear 
title. It was then that the public recreation easement was uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
The state of California is not the only formidable opponent fighting beach 
development. Citizens groups have reared up in revolt. When our elected 
officials fail to look after public interests, citizens take the initiative. In 
Huntington Beach, a local group called Save Our Parks qualified a Charter 
amendment (Measure C) which, if passed in November, would give voters the power 
to approve or deny projects of the scale of "Pierside Village." But this 
project is on the fast track to be approved before the November election. 
</P>
<P>
So who decides when public land will be available for private use? Local 
government is supposed to be the most responsive, but it is also the most 
controlled by special interests. Usually the control is financial. State 
government sees a bigger picture, yet some recent Coastal Commission appointees 
are members of the same financial fraternity that controls local government. 
The final decision may take place in a courtroom, but it shouldn't have to be 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
Planning guidelines clearly give priority to coastal recreational uses. No 
government has ever defined restaurants as recreation. Yet all along the coast, 
developers would have the public believe that "power dining" at pricey 
restaurants with an ocean view is the highest form of coastal recreation. In 
Huntington Beach, there is more than enough room for restaurants on the inland 
side of Pacific Coast Highway. If public beach uses are to be served and public 
views are to be protected, then commercial opportunities are extremely limited. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the development of public lands, the public needs to be 
involved early in the planning process -- before the plans are drawn up, before 
money is invested and before expectations are inflated. Public recreational 
uses must be given priority. Instead of figuring how much commercial 
development can be squeezed onto public lands, the planners should maximize 
public recreation uses. Then and only then should commercial opportunities be 
considered.

AGREEMENT REACHED ON MALL IN SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita will collect at least $137 million in sales taxes in return for 
providing financial aid for an 80-acre regional mall proposed by Newhall Land 
&amp; Farming Co., city officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will allow Newhall Land to proceed with the long-awaited Valencia 
Town Center, the first major retail outlet in the Santa Clarita Valley, and 
funnel the $137 million into the city treasury over 30 years, Assistant City 
Manager Ken Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, expected to be approved Tuesday by the City Council, Santa 
Clarita would issue bonds to pay for $9.95 million in road improvements needed 
for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be paid off with 16% of the sales taxes collected at the mall 
over 30 years, Pulskamp said. The city would not be required to dip into its 
general fund for the money, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land officials initially had requested $12.8 million in aid. Also, as 
an enticement, Newhall Land officials said Santa Clarita could annex 150 acres 
of company property. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials won additional concessions in negotiations, which began in 
July. Newhall Land, the region's major landholder, agreed to permit the 
annexation of 406 acres of commercial land it owns south of Newhall Ranch Road 
and west of Bouquet Canyon Road. The company also agreed to grant the city 
easements for 4.5 miles of hiking trails along the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land officials said the $180-million mall project could not be built 
without financial aid from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents urged the city not to subsidize a private enterprise. But 
Newhall Land officials argued that other California cities, including Palmdale 
and Burbank, had agreed to subsidize new malls by floating bonds to be paid off 
with sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated development Friday, Public Works Director John Medina announced 
that Santa Clarita will begin a curbside recycling program Oct. 18, with a 
first phase involving 3,000 households. The program, to be presented to the 
council Tuesday, may include the entire city by next April, Medina said.

LA QUINTA WINS, STAYS UNDEFEATED

Even though they had won both games this season, La Quinta High School Coach 
Roger Takahashi had been concerned about his team's slow starts in the two 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
Worry no more. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, behind the stellar passing of Donald Hopkins, improved their record 
to 3-0 with a 24-12 nonleague victory over Western (1-2) on Friday night in 
front of about 1,500 at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins completed 12 of 21 passes for 270 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The senior quarterback came out throwing and combined with wide receiver Steve 
Quach on a 77-yard pass play down the right sideline on his third pass attempt 
for La Quinta's first score with 3 minutes 29 seconds left in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta increased the lead to 14-0 with 9:09 remaining in the second period 
when senior tailback George Sanchez capped a 43-yard drive with a two-yard 
plunge on second and goal from two yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Western's one-dimensional offense, which centers around quarterback/kicker 
Gilbert Brito, finally scored with 1:41 left before intermission on a five-yard 
pass from Brito to Alfredo Villegas. Brito provided the key play in the drive 
with a 50-yard run along the left sideline that moved the ball to the Aztec 
17-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Villegas also scored the other Western touchdown on a 16-yard pass from Brito 
with 6:20 to play. The scoring catches were the only two receptions Villegas 
had on the night. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, however, the Aztecs had added a 24-yard field goal by Mike Berg in 
the third period and a 19-yard touchdown pass from Hopkins to running back 
Walter Dawkins early in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins finished with six receptions for 134 yards and with 35 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Brito rushed for 140 yards in 16 carries and completed six of 19 passes for 85 
yards and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our offense is coming around. We are beginning to jell," Takahashi 
said. "I'm very pleased with the way the offensive line played. It couldn't be 
at a better time. We have some momentum going into league."

LOS ALAMITOS BEATS VILLA PARK ON BECKTON'S 109 YARDS, 2 TDS

<P>
The return of running back LaQuan Beckton was just the remedy for Los Alamitos 
High School's ailing offense Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Beckton rushed for 109 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead Los Alamitos to 
a 17-10 nonleague win over Villa Park in front of 3,800 fans in Fred Kelly 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Beckton, a bruising 200-pound senior, missed Los Alamitos' opening two games 
with a hamstring pull, but more than lived up to his lofty preseason billing as 
one of the county's top backs against a strong Villa Park defense. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, Beckton's 12-yard touchdown run with 8:30 remaining ensured Los 
Alamitos the victory and prevented the Griffins from losing two straight games 
for the first time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Only a week ago, Los Alamitos' offense failed to generate a touchdown as the 
Griffins had to be content with a blocked punt for a score and a 91-yard 
interception return in a 17-14 loss to Servite. 
</P>
<P>
"LaQuan makes a big difference in our offense," said John Barnes, Los Alamitos 
coach. "You need that hard-running back to be successful. I thought we got our 
offense going a little better and our defense came up with some key turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park (1-2) wasted three scoring opportunities as tailback Ellis Williams 
fumbled twice and quarterback Jason Martian threw two interceptions. Williams 
had 83 yards in 16 carries, but his fumble into Los Alamitos' end zone midway 
through the third quarter was the turning point of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park held a 10-9 lead when Williams fumbled and Los Alamitos responded 
with an 80-yard drive that was capped by Beckton's winning score. Martian made 
the most of his seven completions, throwing for 159 yards, but his interception 
with 4:16 remaining at Los Alamitos' 20-yard line ended any hopes for a win. 
</P>
<P>
The game showcased two outstanding receivers. Los Alamitos split end Tyler 
Cashman caught 14 passes for 145 yards and also caught a two-point conversion 
pass. Cashman, running primarily short slant patterns, had 12 catches at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Boone, son of Kansas City Royals catcher Bob Boone, caught three long 
passes for 96 yards and made some very difficult catches look easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wild football game," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos went into its meeting last year with Villa Park as the county's 
top-ranked team and came away smarting from a 24-21 loss. After Friday night's 
game, Barnes said the revenge factor was never mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
"We never talked about it," Barnes said. "We talked about the great winning 
tradition at this school and the kids decided they didn't want to lose two 
straight. We've still got a lot of work to do before we play Esperanza in two 
weeks, but we're getting better."

SANTA MARGARITA'S IRELAND GAINS RECORD 242 YARDS

Tailback Josh Ireland rushed for a school-record 242 yards in 15 carries and 
three touchdowns to lead Santa Margarita High School (3-0) to a 35-6 
nonconference victory over Banning (1-2) Friday night in Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland, who also passed 26 yards to David Shearer for another Eagles' 
touchdown, set a school record when he ran 91 yards for his first touchdown on 
the initial play of Santa Margarita's second possession of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Shearer scored the Eagles' final touchdown when he recovered a fumble by 
Banning's punter and ran in from the seven yard line.

SPARKS FLIES IN DEBUT: 281 YARDS, 3 SCORES

<P>
OK, so now we know why Mater Dei High School was so keen about getting Derek 
Sparks enrolled and eligible to play football. 
</P>
<P>
On his first carry in a Mater Dei uniform, Sparks sprinted through a mammoth 
hole in the offensive line, cut to his right and raced 80 yards down the right 
sideline for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The second time he touched the ball, there was a bad exchange as quarterback 
Billy Blanton fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
His second carry was much like the first, but to the left side of the line. 
Again, he broke through a big hole and cut right, and into the open. Again, he 
scored on an 80-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
His third carry went for a 62-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And Santa Ana was finished. With Sparks playing his first game for Mater Dei 
since transferring from Montclair Prep, Mater Dei beat Santa Ana, 38-21, in 
front of 5,000 at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks' final totals were staggering, even to the most hopeful Mater Dei fans. 
He rushed for 281 yards and three touchdowns in 13 carries. By halftime, he had 
229 yards in four carries. Yes, four. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been kind of hard waiting around to play," Sparks said. "Whenever you're 
headed for a new place, there's people trying to knock you off track. I just 
want to go to school and play football." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei is Sparks' third school in as many years. He played at Wilmington 
Banning as a sophomore and Montclair Prep of Van Nuys as a junior and played 
one game for the Mounties before transferring to Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
He only became eligible to play last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been two or three weeks since I last played," said Sparks, who rushed for 
63 yards in 16 carries in Montclair Prep's opening game against Farrington High 
of Honolulu. "I came out and did what I could do. We did what we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
It was an impressive show. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei had not rushed for 100 yards as a team in either of its first two 
games -- a 27-3 loss to Tustin and a 18-15 loss to Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
With Sparks, Mater Dei rushed for 366 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's defense wasn't quick enough to stop Sparks on his early carries, 
but Mater Dei's offensive line blew open giant holes. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Santa Ana (0-3) made some adjustments and hemmed Sparks in 
to a degree. His biggest gain was 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
After Sparks' first touchdown, Santa Ana took advantage of Blanton's fumble, 
scoring on Uvaldo Macias' 25-yard run around left end. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first quarter, Mater Dei led, 21-6, and was coasting. Sparks 
sat out most of the second quarter, but the Monarchs' offense hardly slowed. 
</P>
<P>
David Gonzales' one-yard run, a 21-yard touchdown pass from Blanton to Rick 
Ellis, and a 42-yard field goal by Brian Broadbent helped Mater Dei to a 38-14 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
With the game in hand, Sparks carried nine times in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana could manage only a 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Michael 
Estrada to Robert Tabile. Estrada alternated downs with Marc Contreras, but 
neither could move the team with any consistency.

Jason Johnson did it all for La Habra High School's football team during its 
26-0 rout of Los Altos Friday night at La Habra Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a junior running back, scored two touchdowns and gained 234 yards in 
30 carries. 
</P>
<P>
His longest run was 47 yards. His interception of Los Altos quarterback Mike 
Allen at midfield with 10 minutes 54 seconds left in the third period set up La 
Habra's first scoring drive that ended on a two-yard run by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the third quarter, Sean Jackson blocked a punt by Ben Hernandez that 
was recovered by Mike Martin for La Habra (3-0) at the Los Altos 37. Five plays 
later, Johnson scored again from the two with 3:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
Then with 1:34 left in the third quarter, Matt Moreno returned a punt 75 yards 
for the Highlanders' final score. BOB BORSUM

Marina and Foothill high schools decided to shun the forward pass Friday night, 
choosing to battle it out on the ground at Northrup Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams combined to throw just 18 passes, while rushing the ball 74 times. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust cleared, Marina had a 7-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very lucky to win tonight," Marina Coach John Seeley said. "They shut us 
down completely on offense." 
</P>
<P>
Foothill held Marina to just 98 yards on 37 running plays, stifling the 
Vikings' previously productive ground game. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill's defense set up the Knights' only score, forcing fullback Shawn 
Fullford (18 carries, 85 yards) to fumble at the Marina 24 midway through the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights settled for a 39-yard Keo Powell field goal and a 3-0 lead, but 
then Marina's offense responded with it's only drive of the night. 
</P>
<P>
With 4:18 remaining in the half, Viking quarterback Christin McLemore took 
Marina 77 yards in 12 plays for the only touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a second and 20 with 55 seconds remaining in the half, Marina 
jump-started its passing game when McLemore hit split end David Anderson for 
three consecutive completions, the third time finding him in in the right 
corner of the end zone with 26 seconds remaining in the half. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

Chris Castellano threw two second-quarter touchdown passes to lead Pacifica 
High School to a 14-0 victory over Glenn High on Friday in a nonleague game in 
front of 500 at La Mirada High School. 
</P>
<P>
Castellano was 12 for 28 for 137 yards with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
His first touchdown was a nine-yarder to Jim Lochner with 10 minutes 17 seconds 
left in the second quarter. Pacifica (2-1) started the short scoring drive at 
the Glenn 15 because Glenn punter Jerry Jornadal touched his knee to the ground 
going for a low snap. 
</P>
<P>
The second scoring pass came on Pacifica's next possession. Castellano 
completed a 14-yarder to Eric Stevens. The play capped a 66-yard, eight-play 
drive. Dave Anderson kicked both extra points. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica's defense was impressive as well. The Mariners held Glenn (2-1) to 17

one-yard go-ahead touchdown, and an interception by Robert Choi set up a field 
goal by Josh Nelson.

Servite took a 23-7 lead on running back Chandler Robbins' 16-yard run with two

'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS': IS IT COMEDY OR BIGOTRY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The complaints against "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All To You," 
registered by Costa Mesa residents John and Ernie Feeney as being 
"anti-religious bigotry," are totally ludicrous ("Pair Seek to Close Play in 
Costa Mesa as 'Anti-Religious,' " Sept. 12). I don't know when I have spent a 
more enjoyable afternoon filled with lots of delightful laughs! 
</P>
<P>
It seems that some people . . . state that this play "goes beyond satire and 
viciously attacks the beliefs of the Catholic Church." Is it the truth that 
offends the Feeneys? If the play hadn't presented the truth about Catholic 
dogma, then there is nothing to be upset about! 
</P>
<P>
We are all spirits housed in the body, so where is our spirituality toward God 
instead of dogmas of various religious faiths? Dogmas did not come from God! 
</P>
<P>
"Sister Mary Ignatius" and "The Actor's Nightmare" were excellent and gave many 
people much needed laughter. I have certainly seen PG-13 movies that were not 
as funny and certainly were more offensive in language, dress and love scenes 
than this play. 
</P>
<P>
Get Spiritual, not Religious! They are two different things. God is spirit and 
we are letting church leaders dictate to us religious dogmas and symbolism, not 
the spirituality of God. 
</P>
<P>
Grants from the government have most certainly been squandered in many more 
wasteful and sinful ways than any grant received by the Costa Mesa Civic 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure God and his Son, Jesus, had some good chuckles with "Sister Many 
Ignatius."

'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS': IS IT COMEDY OR BIGOTRY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' casual editorial attitude regarding Catholic bashing ("Sister Mary 
Ignatius Isn't Happy," Sept. 13) prompts a comment. 
</P>
<P>
The writer notes "There's no question that 'Sister Mary Ignatius' takes a 
brutal, satirical look at Catholic dogma, and some will be offended by its 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
Having studied the script of the play, I would agree entirely with this 
evaluation and point out that, by definition, to satirize is to hold up to 
ridicule or scorn. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You" opened in an 
off-Broadway theater in 1980, decent and fair-minded people from all sectors of 
society, including public officials and legislators around the country, the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith as well as the American Jewish 
Committee, have condemned this unremitting travesty of Catholic ritual, 
tradition and values, with its particularly cruel caricature of Catholic 
sisters. Moreover, a serious injustice is added to the insult when such 
religious bigotry is supported with tax dollars. But The Times gives the 
concern only an editorial shrug and suggests that there are more important 
matters to occupy us. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God that racism and anti-Semitism are types of prejudice that are too 
disreputable to be supported by most newspapers today. Anti-Catholicism, 
however, is apparently one type of bigotry which "enlightened" and 
"open-minded" editors continue to tolerate. The Times has once again 
demonstrated its concurrence with this fashion.

FACES . . . : WATERGATE'S LIDDY LOOKS FOR LAUGHS WITH NBC'S 'CAMP CUCAMONGA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who would have ever believed it? 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years ago, G. Gordon Liddy, the former FBI agent and intelligence 
chief for Richard Nixon's Committee to Re-elect the President was the most 
notorious villain involved in the Watergate break-in and cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's best known as a character actor specializing in, of course, villain 
roles. He takes his first stab at comedy in NBC's "Camp Cucamonga," airing 
Sunday at 7 p.m. on KNBC. "The comic plot is driven by mistaken identity," says 
Liddy. "The camp director is expecting two people: One is the repair man and 
the other, the camp inspector. I am the inspector, but am mistaken for the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Liddy is back -- playing the bad guy in the two-hour premiere of the new 
syndicated action-series "Super Force," which premieres Friday at 7:30 p.m. on 
KTLA. "I am an evil genius in this," he says with a laugh. "If you can believe 
this, I'm part Irish, part Portuguese and part Japanese. I think the worst of 
all three is wrapped up in me." 
</P>
<P>
Liddy made his acting debut five years ago as the evil Capt. Real Estate on 
"Miami Vice." Universal's casting director, Bonnie Timmerman, approached him 
about the role. "It was originally envisioned that Don (Johnson) would shoot me 
and that would be that," he says. "We actually shot this great death scene. It 
was so well done that my wife was in tears. I thought, 'I just got a Emmy Award 
here.' But they liked me so much that decided to bring me back in a reoccuring 
role, so my Emmy-winning death scene never got out of the cutting room." 
</P>
<P>
And what does Liddy think of President Bush's handling of the Iraq-Kuwait 
situation? 
</P>
<P>
"I think up to the present moment, he has performed very well," says Liddy. "He 
and Hussein are now two scorpions in a bottle and the first one who blinks is 
going to die. The whole question is whether the country will stay with George 
Bush long enough to do what I think he intends to do, and that is get rid of 
Hussein. There's no point in talking with Hussein because you can't believe 
anything he says. If he says it's high noon you better put your head out the 
window and check, because he is probably lying." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anderson's 'Orpheus' Role on TNT Is Second Time Opposite Redgrave 
</P>
<P>
Acting opposite the legendary Vanessa Redgrave, says Kevin Anderson, "is like 
walking out on the court with Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old actor made his Broadway debut last year opposite Redgrave in 
Tennessee Williams' sultry drama, "Orpheus Descending." Anderson played Val 
Xavier, a mysterious stranger who arrives in a small Mississippi town and falls 
in love with a lonely Sicilian housewife (Redgrave). 
</P>
<P>
Both Anderson and Redgrave are repeating their roles in the TNT movie version 
of "Orpheus," premiering Monday at 5, 8 and 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a member of Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre who has appeared in such 
films as "Orphans" and "In Country," had flown to London to audition for "Miss 
Saigon." He didn't get the part in the lavish musical, but was hired 
immediately for the role of Val after meeting with "Orpheus" director Sir Peter 
Hall and Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
"This may sound really meathead," says the Illinois native, "but I didn't know 
a lot about Peter Hall. I knew he was a director of a big theater in England. I 
kind of stupidly asked, 'Are you with the Royal Shakespeare Company?' And with 
Vanessa, I hadn't seen seen all of her movies. I wasn't in awe of them, I was 
just trying to get the job." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on Broadway wasn't fun for the soft-spoken actor. "It was hard on 
me," says Anderson. "It was my first time on Broadway, which is a big deal. 
Then I had to deal with me being compared to Marlon Brando, who had done the 
movie version ("The Fugitive Kind"). It was very pressured." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson still has doubts about whether he's right for the part of the ex-stud 
clad in a snakeskin jacket. "I thought I was a little too young," he says. "And 
having seen the Brando movie, I was wondering if I would be sexy enough. But 
there are a lot of comparisons between me and Val. He is sort of a wild boy who 
grew up in the bayous, and I grew up in a small town in a very free 
environment. I think this guy is what everybody wants to be like -- pure and 
free." SUSAN KING

I do not like the (review) about New Kids. It is rude.

It said in the paper a girl threw a stuffed animal at Donnie, and Donnie picked 
it up and threw it back and said, 'You oughta stop throwing things." That's not 
true because I was at that concert. Danny does not sing bad, and Jordan is my 
favorite, so don't talk about him.

FESTIVAL: NOT JUST A NUMBERS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Especially poignant and praiseworthy was festival director Peter Sellars' 
invitation to the local Native American community to participate. The inclusion 
of indigenous American artists and performers, the reverence and respect for 
Native American spirituality and the opportunity for the traditional, 
indigenous cultures of the Pacific Rim to share their arts will have a deep and 
long-lasting effect on all who were able to be there and even those who 
weren't.

O'CONNOR'S ERROR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sinead O'Connor, in receiving her MTV Video Music Award, stated that 
"censorship in any form is bad but when it's racism disguised as censorship, 
that is even worse" (Sept. 8 ). 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor was obviously referring to the controversy surrounding the rap lyrics 
of 2 Live Crew's album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." 
</P>
<P>
But has O'Connor actually heard these lyrics or has she, like most people, only 
heard the subject discussed in the abstract? 
</P>
<P>
The failure of most of the media to actually quote the lyrics has allowed the 
impression to be created that racism is what has motivated the criticism and, 
consequently, this has allowed for record-industry manipulation of the public, 
and maybe O'Connor herself. 
</P>
<P>
To expose the fraudulent claim of racism, the lyrics' violent offensiveness -- 
namely the exultation over a man's bursting of a woman's vagina -- must be 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the New York Times, a black assistant professor of philosophy 
took a white columnist to task for defending these lyrics as part of "black 
culture." As she states, to treat the sexual abuse of black women as an 
affirmation of black culture is "horrific." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, I would guess, has personal bodyguards and travels in a secure 
manner. Most women, however, especially the woman in the ghetto, do not have 
that luxury.

'BIENNIAL I' LAUNCHES A TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
PHOTOGRAPHY: THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM OF PHOTOGRAPHY IN RIVERSIDE OPENS FALL 
SEASON TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It isn't difficult to round up a bunch of contemporary photographs every two 
years, put them on public view and call it a biennial. The tough part, if 
you're a thoughtful curator, is to develop criteria for selecting which of 
thousands of possibilities to show. Should you establish geographic 
limitations? Should you try to represent a wide range of techniques and 
aesthetic approaches or should you narrow the focus and explore one point of 
view? 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of "Biennial I" at the California Museum of Photography in Riverside 
-- which will open the museum's fall season with a reception from 6:30 to 8:30 
tonight -- faced all these questions and more. While choosing works for an 
exhibition, they were launching a tradition for a closely watched museum. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was established in 1973 at UC Riverside, the museum has had a 
well-regarded but limited exhibition program. With the museum's recent move off 
campus into its own building on the downtown pedestrian mall came expectations 
of more vigorous engagement with contemporary photography. "Biennial I" is the 
first chance for contemporary artists and their audience to check out the 
climate at the new museum. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the weather is hazy. "Biennial I" is a smart and "politically 
correct" show, but it feels rather ponderous and dispirited. Any conclusions 
must be tempered, however, by the fact that the exhibition was actually 
organized a couple of years ago by co-curators Edward Earle and Deborah Klochko 
with former museum director Charles Desmarais, who now directs the Laguna Art 
Museum. Delays in the building meant that the show was delayed. To their 
credit, the curators updated many of their original selections to substitute 
new work, but the catalogue couldn't be changed. 
</P>
<P>
A curatorial statement says that the 19 artists selected are based in 
California, but "Biennial I" is not a survey of California photography. Instead 
the show "examines conceptual undercurrents running throughout the medium. What 
unifies the artists is . . . work that challenges conventional definitions 
about the nature of photography. With a conservative political climate 
demanding standardized definitions of art, 'Biennial I' challenges the viewer 
to expand the meaning of photography," the statement says. 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough, except that the only "politically correct" position seems to be 
this questioning stance -- a stance so thoroughly entrenched that it has formed 
its own academy with legions of acolytes dutifully nodding and churning out 
approved work. If any serious criticism can be leveled at the show, it is not 
that the curators carefully excluded photographs that might simply be perceived 
as beautiful art or that they purposefully left out street photography. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is beating the drum of a revolution that has long since been fought 
and won. Even though many people still think photographs should look like Ansel 
Adams' landscapes, there's a cynical fatigue factor in relentlessly 
"challenging the medium" as an end in itself. 
</P>
<P>
Once you get past the ideology and simply look at the art, some of the haze 
clears up. With a characteristically light touch, Ilene Segalove cuts through 
artistic pretensions in two "Home Entertainment Center" collages, which take a 
wry view of the golden age of radio by picturing rapt listeners with electronic 
boxes that emit a greenish haze. 
</P>
<P>
Another conceptualist, Elizabeth R. Bryant, questions accepted meanings of 
visual language in photographic panels that pair a picture of a hand holding a 
telephone receiver with silhouettes of objects containing a plethora of images. 
Meanwhile, Joseph Squier makes ghostly life-size images of nude figures that 
present intriguing conflicts when you try to figure out what they mean. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn Thi Pham, a Vietnamese artist living in Southern California, uses 
photographs to unload the burden of physical and mental abuse that has 
afflicted her people. That may sound like pressing art into public service, but 
she succeeds through ambiguity. Several photographs of theatrical tableaux, 
depicting a dreamlike mix of domesticity and violence, are sharply effective. 
Unfortunately, these strong images get lost in a disjointed installation that 
includes expressionistic painting. 
</P>
<P>
The show's only traditional social documentation is Richard A. Lou's deliberate 
"fraud" of posing himself as street people and displaying the pictures with 
fictitious texts. In light of Cindy Sherman's extensive self-portraiture, this 
work seems thin, though questioning the "truth" of photographs is very much to 
the point of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Many other artists address social and political issues, however. "Found 
Voices," a scaled-down version of Kim Abeles' "Living With AIDS" project, 
presents taped conversations of people with AIDS in a roomlike setting equipped 
with a padded listening desk. Lisa Bloomfield takes a more subtle issue -- 
career motivation -- and handles it deftly in "self-congratulatory" images of 
anonymous males coupled with invented success stories. Her satirical approach 
renders "success" an absurdity, and the trappings that commemorate it just so 
much fluff. 
</P>
<P>
Ideas are the life of this show, and rarely more so than in David Bunn's witty 
South America "sighting," which was part of his "Sphere of Influence" 
exhibition at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Locating a crack in the concrete 
floor that resembles South America, Bunn framed it, made a rubbing of it and 
set up elaborate ways of viewing it, so that visitors put themselves in the 
position of intrepid explorers in foreign lands. What does this have to do with 
photography? Not much in a conventional sense, but interpretation of visual 
data is a central point of the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious work in "Biennial I" is probably Stephen Axelrad's 
interactive video installation, "Self-Search." Casting himself as the 
California Museum of Photography, with an image of his talking mouth on the 
building, he leads into vignettes about photography, the museum, its 
collections and his private life. You have the illusion of being able to figure 
it all out, but no matter how many times you touch flickering images on the 
screen, you can only see as much as Axelrad has programmed. 
</P>

Having revived prime-time animation with "The Simpsons," Fox seems well on the 
way to sparking a similar renaissance on Saturday morning. Three of the 
network's first children's cartoon shows are imaginative, original and 
entertaining: For the first time in years -- if not decades -- watching 
Saturday morning television is fun for adults as well as children. 
</P>
<P>
Fox has allowed a creative group of writers, artists and directors to exercise 
their talents freely, and the results sparkle with imagination, a quality their 
network counterparts sorely lack. 
</P>
<P>
Created by children's author-illustrator Shane DeRolf, the delightful "Zazoo U" 
focuses on the often surreal goings-on at a bizarre school. Two rap-speaking 
birds walk on and change the backgrounds whenever the scene shifts. The casual 
insanity of "Zazoo U" is utterly unlike anything that's ever been on Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the trend toward younger characters on children's shows, "Tom 
&amp; Jerry Kids" stars junior versions of the cat-and-mouse team that won Bill 
Hanna and Joe Barbera seven Oscars. Like the original shorts, the new cartoons 
use no dialogue, only sight gags -- a welcome respite from the talky formulas 
of so much kidvid. 
</P>
<P>
"Droopy and Dribble" brings back Tex Avery's phlegmatic basset hound, with a 
slightly smaller son. The wild takes and exaggerrated expressions may not be as 
perfectly timed and animated as they were in Avery's theatrical shorts, but 
this frenetic show is truer to the spirit of those classic '40s cartoon than 
the flamboyantly stale "Tiny Toon Adventures." 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Howie Mandel provides the voice for a suburban father and his 
4-year-old son in "Bobby's World." Much of the action takes place in the world 
of Bobby's overly fertile imagination: When Dad announces the family's going to 
visit Aunt Ruth, Bobby pictures himself commiserating with distorted victims 
who've had their cheeks pinched out of shape by the terrible Aunt Ruth Monster. 
Both funny and charming, "Bobby's World" deserves a prime-time spot. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the new shows on ABC, CBS and NBC suggest that a truckload of 
threadbare teen-age sitcoms crashed on the way to the dump, flooding the screen 
with stale ideas. Viewers can tell these weary retreads are supposed to be hip: 
The characters use dude at least once in every sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"New Kids on the Block" (ABC), combines a badly animated version of the popular 
bubble-gum rock band with cuts from concert footage. Apparently the biggest 
problem the Kids face is how to escape the hordes of female admirers, and this 
fanzine mentality makes the show even less interesting than the group's music. 
</P>
<P>
Down the block, as it were, are "The Guys Next Door" (NBC), a live-action 
attempt to re-do "The Monkees" in the '90s. The producers apparently spent more 
on hair mousse than writers, and the show demonstrates its ecological awareness 
by recycling used gags. If these guys live nearby, the neighborhood must be 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
The live action/animation "Kid 'n' Play" (NBC) features lame stories about a 
teen-age rap group and stiff animation. Black characters are rare on Saturday 
morning TV, and it's regrettable this show doesn't have more going for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick Moranis in Gravedale High" (NBC) features an uninteresting caricature of 
the movie star riding herd on a standard assortment of teen-age monsters. "Bill 
&amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" (CBS) repeats the inanities of the recent film 
about two dimwitted but cool dudes traveling through time. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the pseudocomic slate is "Little Rosie" (ABC), featuring a cartoon 
version of Roseanne Barr as a child. Unlike her brash adult alter-ego, the 
young Roseanne is just an ordinary kidvid character. The stories that send her 
on imaginary adventures use material similar to "Bobby's World," but the 
difference is the one letter that distinguishes class from crass. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wizard of Oz" (ABC) must rank as the nastiest trick that's been played on 
the inhabitants of L. Frank Baum's enchanted land since the villainous Mombie 
cast a spell on Princess Ozma. The producers foolishly based the program on the 
classic 1939 film: Everybody knows how Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, 
Margaret Hamilton et al. are supposed to look and move and sound, and the 
cartoon versions don't even come close. Watching this show is a bit like 
watching a cassette of the MGM musical that got caught in the trashmasher. "Oz" 
fans should consider dropping a house on ABC headquarters.

LUTHERAN TURNS CATHOLIC: GROWTH OR BETRAYAL?; 
</P>
<P>
A DESIRE FOR UNITY FORCES THE DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD JOHN NEUHAUS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have resisted with great difficulty, especially over the last five years, the 
recognition that I could no longer give an answer convincing to others or to me 
as to why I was not a Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
So on Sept. 8 I was received into full communion with the Roman Catholic Church 
and am preparing to enter the priesthood of the Catholic Church. This decision 
is the result of many years of prayer, reflection, conversation, and, I firmly 
believe, the leading of the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 20 years and more, I have repeatedly urged that the separated 
ecclesial existence of Lutheranism, if it was once necessary, is no longer 
necessary; and, if no longer necessary, such separated existence is no longer 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, cooperating with other evangelical catholics who shared my 
understanding of the Lutheran destiny and duty according to the Augsburg 
Confession, I devoted myself to the healing of the breach of the 16th Century 
between Rome and the Reformation. This means ecclesial reconciliation and the 
restoration of full communion with the Bishop of Rome. That is a consummation 
for which I continue to pray, and to which I earnestly hope my present decision 
will contribute. 
</P>
<P>
With respect to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America of which I was a 
pastor, the evidence made me conclude that its operative understanding of the 
Church is formed not by the ecclesiology of the New Testament, nor by that of 
the fathers, nor by that of the Augsburg Confession, but by American 
denominationalism. 
</P>
<P>
I can no longer persuade myself that Lutheranism is an evangelical catholic 
movement of Gospel reform within and for the one Church of Christ. It now seems 
to me that Lutheranism is a Protestant denomination among Protestant 
denominations, and is determined to remain so. 
</P>
<P>
I know well the claim of some Lutherans that separated ecclesial existence is 
necessary for the sake of the Gospel -- as the Gospel is understood in terms of 
justification by grace through faith because of Christ. I beg such Lutherans to 
consider that that Gospel can be proclaimed today in the Roman Catholic Church. 
Moreover, it is by no means evident that the Lutheran denomination, as a matter 
of fact, bear witness to that Gospel. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot begin to express adequately my gratitude for all the goodness I have 
known in the Lutheran communion. There I was baptized, there I learned my 
prayers, there I was introduced to Scripture and Creed, there I was nurtured by 
Christ on Christ; there I came to know the utterly gratuitous love of God by 
which we live astonished. For my theological formation, for friendships beyond 
numbering, for great battles fought, for mutual consolations in defeat, for 
companionship in ministry -- for all this I give thanks and know that I will 
forever be in debt to the church called Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Most especially am I grateful for my 30 years as a pastor. There is nothing in 
that ministry that I would repudiate, except my many sins and shortcomings. My 
becoming a priest in the Roman Catholic Church will be the completion and right 
ordering of what was begun 30 years ago. Nothing that was good is rejected; all 
is fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
I have been left in no doubt that many Lutherans, and perhaps others, will be 
grievously disappointed and even angered by this decision. I cannot ask them to 
share my joy at this time; I do ask them to try to understand. As God permits, 
I will at some future time give a fuller explanation of why I have done what I 
had to do. Those who know my writings know that I am aware of the problems to 
be encountered also in the Roman Catholic Church. But for now it is enough that 
I have been brought this far. 
</P>
<P>
To those of you with whom I have traveled in the past, know that we travel 
together still. In the mystery of Christ and His Church, nothing is lost, and 
the broken will be mended. If, as I do believe, my communion with Christ's 
Church is now the fuller, then it needs be that my unity with all who are in 
Christ is the stronger. 
</P>
<P>
I do not presume to think that I could ever repay those who, over the months 
and years, have borne with me through the studies, conversations, arguments and 
doubts of this decision's making. I am most particularly grateful to my former 
bishop, William Lazareth, and my new bishop, John Cardinal O'Connor, for their 
friendship, understanding, counsel and constant support. 
</P>
<P>
There is now a great peace, but I know it will not always be peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POINT/COUNTERPOINT 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus, a prominent Lutheran scholar and writer known for 
his critiques of liberal Christianity, announced Sept. 8 that he was joining 
the Roman Catholic Church. Neuhaus was considered one of the 20 most 
influential Lutherans in the mid-1980s, primarily because of his newsletter, 
"Forum Letter," and other writings on religion and politics. Here he explains 
his reasons for the change. The Rev. Charles Austin, pastor of Christ Lutheran 
Church in Ridgefield Park, N.J., and a former religion reporter for the New 
York Times, takes exception.

POP BEAT: THE TIME TAKES A LICKIN', KEEPS TICKIN'; 
</P>
<P>
RHYTHM &amp; BLUES: THE BAND SEEMED DESTINED FOR SUPERSTARDOM UNTIL MORRIS DAY 
AND JESSE JOHNSON OPTED FOR SOLO CAREERS. IT REPRESENTED UNFINISHED BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"It's Time time again -- you know what I'm sayin'," crowed Morris Day, the 
breezy, preening hipster who personifies the swagger and rollicking spirit of 
the Time's funky R&amp;B music. 
</P>
<P>
What he was really saying is that the Time, after an untimely split seven years 
ago, has reunited. Day spent the good part of a late-afternoon interview 
boasting about the group's new album "Pandemonium," which has gotten rave 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the best funk band of the '80s, the Time is now the best funk band of 
the '90s -- so far anyway -- with a recent Top 20 album and a Top 10 single, 
"Jerk Out." 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, the Time has four songs on "Graffiti Bridge," the sound-track 
album from Prince's movie, which is due for release in the fall. The Time is 
also featured in the film, a sequel to 1984's "Purple Rain." 
</P>
<P>
A Minneapolis-based band that Prince boosted to prominence in the early '80s, 
the Time also features keyboardist Jimmy (Jam) Harris, bassist Terry Lewis, 
singer Jerome Benton, keyboardist Monte Moir, drummer Jellybean Johnson and 
guitarist Jesse Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
When the Time split up -- on the heels of the success of "Purple Rain" -- the 
band seemed on the verge of superstardom. A major factor was Jesse Johnson's 
and Day's succumbing to the lure of solo stardom. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, since the split, Harris and Lewis, who formed a 
producing/songwriting team during their Time tenure, have been the most 
successful, masterminding Janet Jackson's last two hit albums. 
</P>
<P>
Though Jesse Johnson did three albums on A&amp;M Records, he has never become a 
major star. Benton has been dabbling, with mild success, in music and films. As 
a session musician, Jellybean Johnson is a major cog in the Harris-Lewis 
production team. Moir's biggest credit is working as a producer/writer with 
that team. 
</P>
<P>
But after making such a vivid impression as the droll rogue in "Purple Rain," 
Day seemed the most likely to become a big star -- as a singer or actor, or 
maybe both. But his two albums were just modest hits. He has had featured roles 
in TV sitcoms that never made it big -- including "New Attitude," which was 
made for ABC. His most recent movie role was in "The Adventures of Ford 
Fairlane," a part that he downgrades as "a minor part in a bad movie." 
</P>
<P>
So it's obvious that Day's reason for doing the Time album was to boost his 
career. Right? "That's jive," Day said. "I did this project so I could work 
with my buddies again. I have a lot of projects to work on. I like working in 
the Time but I don't need the Time. I'm not desperate." 
</P>
<P>
Neither, he added, are any of the other members -- especially Harris and Lewis. 
For that pair, part of the fun of the reunion is the chance to be musicians 
again for a change. Like Day, they also wanted a chance to re-establish the 
camaraderie they enjoyed in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Harris added in a separate interview, the Time represented unfinished 
business -- a sentiment echoed by Day. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had a feeling that the band ended prematurely, that there were still 
some good years left in the band -- if we could ever put it back together," Day 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A prelude to this reunion was a brief get-together in 1987 to play an awards 
show in Minnesota. "It wasn't an official reunion because Monte didn't play," 
Harris said. "But it felt good playing together again. We all knew it was 
something we wanted to do when the time was right." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Harris said, the Time had planned to make its own movie, with a 
cameo appearance by Prince. "But then Prince came to us about doing a movie -- 
a Prince movie with an appearance by the Time," Harris recalled. "We wound up 
doing it his way. He was persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
On one important level, the road to the reunion was smooth. "There were no 
hostilities between members," Harris said. "If some people hated each other we 
would have never even thought about a reunion. We got along together and we 
stayed in touch."

MOVIES: THE ACTOR GETS HIS FIRST CHANCE TO PLAY A ROMANTIC LEADING MAN IN 
'FUNNY ABOUT LOVE.' 'I WANTED TO BE MORE OF A HUMAN BEING,' HE SAYS.

<P>
The posters promoting Paramount Pictures' "Funny About Love" show Gene Wilder 
in a wacky pose with an alarm clock and baby perched on top of his red-blond 
Brillo hair. The image is typical of how audiences have come to perceive the 
actor, best known for an endearingly guileless slapstick schtick that has 
defined his on-screen persona from 1968's "The Producers" through his last 
film, 1989's "See No Evil, Hear No Evil." 
</P>
<P>
However, those actually seeing the movie, which opened Friday, will find a far 
different Wilder than they have encountered before. In "Funny About Love," he 
plays a romantic leading man, and, really going against the comedy grain, the 
character is not always particularly likable. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy Bergman (Wilder) is a cartoonist, engulfed by adulation and awards, but 
lonely for love. When finally found in the character of Meg (Christine Lahti), 
Duffy's frantic desire for a baby drives first an emotional, and then a 
physical wedge between them. 
</P>
<P>
"The character is different than anything I have done before," said Wilder, who 
has begun reassessing his career since the death last year of his wife, Gilda 
Radner. "In many of my past scripts, we just got to the humor as fast as 
possible. With Duffy, I could work more to create a whole character." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder says that he began rethinking his career during the making of "See No 
Evil, Hear No Evil" while Radner was battling ovarian cancer. "I had a lot to 
do with the writing of ("See No Evil, Hear No Evil")," Wilder said, "not the 
plot, but some of the scenes with Richard (Pryor), when we were talking as 
human beings and not being chased by cars. It was gratifying to say I was 
talking from my center and not from some loony-tunes cardboard character. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the middle of a lot of things as far as my heart's desire for work 
was concerned. I thought if I did work I wanted to be more of a human being." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder said that he was surprised that Leonard Nimoy, who directed "Funny About 
Love," saw this need in him too. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never met him before," Wilder said, "and I don't know how he knew . . . 
'Blazing Saddles' and 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Stir Crazy' and 'Silver Streak' 
. . . How would he know to put me in this?" 
</P>
<P>
Nimoy, who met Wilder at his Connecticut house to offer him the part, said, "I 
have seen a lot of his work. I see a very gifted person. I see an extremely 
intelligent person. I see a person capable of great comedy and great 
sensitivity. The role is that of a funny, turbulent and troubled guy, and I 
thought he could handle it. I think the tremendous depth he is capable of will 
surprise people. . . . He is capable of bringing great comedy out of a 
wellspring of deep emotion like (Charlie) Chaplin." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder said that when he met Nimoy, he asked, "Why me?," and the director 
answered, "Because I want the audience to forgive Duffy, and they might not 
forgive someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Making the film fulfilled many of Wilder's hopes for such a project. 
</P>
<P>
"The day-to-day work on the film was a constant surprise for me," he recalled. 
"Surprises about myself and the emotion that would fill a scene. I wouldn't 
have a clue what was going to happen sometimes and then, when it hit, it was so 
big that I was shocked afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder continues: "I'm an all right actor. A fairly good actor. But I'm a great 
reactor . . . and I had something to react to all the time. I felt at this 
point in my life and in my career my task in this film should be 'don't act.' 
Just go with what was happening at the moment, and don't try to work out clever 
things." 
</P>
<P>
If Wilder feels so comfortable with the change in his screen persona, part of 
his ease derives from his training as a classical actor. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Milwaukee 55 years ago, Wilder began acting at 8, doing comic skits to 
divert his ill mother. At 13, he started private dramatic training and while in 
his late teens appeared in summer stock productions of Tennessee Williams and 
Arthur Miller plays. He continued with drama at the University of Iowa and 
later studied the physical aspects of acting -- gymnastics, fencing (he became 
a champion fencer) and movement -- at London's Old Vic theater school before 
returning to New York and embarking on a stage career. 
</P>
<P>
His first play was Arnold Wesker's "Roots," quickly followed by his Broadway 
debut as the comic valet in Graham Greene's "The Complaisant Lover." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's first film role was that of the terrified undertaker in 1967's "Bonnie 
and Clyde." "Instead of being conventionally frightened, I put on an act of 
trying not to be afraid which was, I guess, amusing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year earlier, while acting with Anne Bancroft in Brecht's "Mother 
Courage," that Wilder met her husband Mel Brooks and eventually began a 
collaboration that put his career on the comedic track that made him a star. It 
also resulted in a number of outrageously satirical films, beginning with "The 
Producers," in which he co-starred with Brooks and the late Zero Mostel. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for Mel," Wilder said with a laugh, "I'd still be doing 
temporary typing for a living, and selling toys at F.A.O. Schwarz for $1.40 an 
hour. I played with the trains all day." 
</P>
<P>
Does Wilder believe his wife's death propelled his career in its new, more 
serious direction? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes -- but I wouldn't be foolish enough to deny what the nature of my talent 
is. I don't want to do 'Hamlet.' I don't want to do Robert Redford roles or Mel 
Gibson roles or Kevin Costner roles because I'm not going to be good at them. I 
don't want to do a tragic clown (either). I want to do what I can lend my 
talents to, but I want it to be as a human being and not as a two-dimensional 
character." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder said of the sad times before and after his wife's death: "I thought for 
a while that I wouldn't be working anymore, and then I thought even if I wanted 
to, no one would ask me. Then, I found to my amazement, I suppose because of 
VCRs and cable, no one thought of me as gone because they saw me last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done overlapping films like this, starting one before the other has 
opened, in a long time," he said of his new project, 
</P>
<P>
Wilder is now at work on Peter Bogdanovich's "Another You," filming in New York 
and co-starring (again) Richard Pryor. The film, about a con-man (Pryor) and a 
pathological liar (Wilder) will continue the evolution of his persona. 
Bogdanovich said of Wilder's part in the new film, "He's really playing a 
character part in this, kind of a sad sack who is also very funny." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond this point? "I've come to a point now where I like not to plan, I won't 
say more than a day ahead, but more than a week at a time," Wilder said 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what is going to happen. Once I say I'm going to do a movie, I 
do it -- I'm very professional that way, but, otherwise, I don't like to think 
ahead.I have no plans for films after this. I trust if your life is right, the 
right things will happen at the right time. If the chords are in harmony 
inside, I think other things will happen in the same way. That sounded 
highfalutin to me once, but I believe it now."

DISCORD OVER 'MISS SAIGON' ACCORD; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: ASIAN-AMERICANS SAY THEY HAD NO REPRESENTATION IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"What do we want? Equity! When do we want it? Now!" 
</P>
<P>
Chanting those words, about 60 picketers wearing yellow armbands marched on the 
sidewalk Friday in front of the Hollywood office of Actors' Equity, protesting 
the Monday accord between the union and "Miss Saigon" producer Cameron 
Mackintosh over the casting of the Broadway production. The $10-million London 
musical is scheduled to begin previews March 23 in New York and open April 11. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the protesters were Asian-American activists critical of the accord and 
what they see as lack of representation from Asian-Americans in the 
negotiations that resulted in the agreement. Simultaneous events were also 
scheduled for New York and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
According to a copy of the agreement obtained by The Times, Equity agreed to 
allow Mackintosh to alternate two non-American Asian actors in the title role 
of the musical, "if no American Asian actors can be found." The agreement 
stipulated that eight candidates are under consideration for the role, 
including two who are not American citizens, and added, "it is hoped that 
future auditions may provide additional Asian American candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Open auditions for the Asian roles in the show will be Friday and next Saturday 
at the Los Angeles Music Center and Oct. 1 and 2 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
However, "if none of the candidates proves to have the specific qualities 
necessary to originate this major role on Broadway," Mackintosh reserved the 
right to request permission for Lea Salonga, the Filipina actress who created 
the role in London, to do it in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh also agreed that "for all U.S. productions of 'Miss Saigon,' neither 
'yellowface' makeup nor prosthetics for eyes will be used for any actor." 
Mackintosh asserted that the white actor who is being imported from London to 
play the Engineer, Jonathan Pryce, had never used "yellowface" in his London 
performance, but he acknowledged that Pryce had initially used prosthetics to 
make his eyes look more Asian until he "became aware that their use was 
offensive to the American Asian community." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also established that "these special arrangements for 'Miss 
Saigon' are not intended to establish a precedent" and will be binding "subject 
to written confirmation from the League of American Theatres and Producers." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement contains "too many loopholes, too many exceptions," said 
demonstrator James Hong, who said he has been a working actor for 37 years. 
"There was no representation from the Asian side (in the negotiations). Is the 
(union) trying to hide something? The modern generation (of Asian-American 
actors) isn't going to give any more ground." 
</P>
<P>
There was some disagreement over whether a demonstration would be mounted at 
the Music Center auditions next week. Dom Magwili said he doubted it. "This is 
not censorship. Actors who choose to audition are working on their own 
conscience." But actor Tzi Ma said "I think we will be down there (to 
demonstrate)." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in New York, an Equity statement announced that executive secretary 
Alan Eisenberg and Carole Hughes, equal employment opportunity business 
representative for the union, will meet with minority members to discuss 
'Saigon'-related issues on Monday in New York and Thursday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Equity "is aware of the frustration, anger and outrage . . . ," according to 
the statement, and "continues to maintain its commitment to increased 
employment for its ethnic minority members."

RICK DU BROW: SATURDAY-NIGHT SPECIAL; 
</P>
<P>
BURNETT ANTHOLOGY SERIES ADDS FIREPOWER TO NO. 1 NETWORK'S LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC has spent a lot of time promoting its new sitcom "Fresh Prince of Bel Air." 
But some real TV royalty, Carol Burnett, may well be more valuable in keeping 
the No. 1 network on its ratings throne. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett's half-hour comedy anthology, "Carol &amp; Company" -- which debuted 
March 31 and was an instant hit -- has its new-season premiere tonight at 10. 
And the way things are going, it could be part of a trio of back-to-back series 
-- "The Golden Girls," "Empty Nest" and the Burnett show -- that holds the key 
to NBC's success in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett, eternally youthful and buoyant, entered the Beverly Wilshire Hotel for 
a 90-minute interview the other day wearing a well-worn, blue denim jacket 
embroidered with theatrical mementoes, a short blue denim skirt and a simple 
orange shirt. She came alone -- no accompanying publicist. The essence of 
simplicity -- as usual. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, she hates it when her show is described as an instant hit -- "It 
disturbed me as much as saying something's a flop after three weeks" -- because 
it tells her how TV has changed: 
</P>
<P>
"I really do notice this immediate judgment -- 'It's great' or 'Let's bury it.' 
If that was true, my old series (the 1967-79 'Carol Burnett Show') wouldn't 
have survived. We weren't a hit until after our third year. But if they 
believed in something, they gave you a chance. Now they're so quick to judge 
everything, and I don't like that at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to fly by the seat of their pants anymore. They're more careful. 
They were so careful about this anthology idea. They almost had to be forced 
into it. I think because it was Matt Williams (who previously created 
'Roseanne') and because it was me and because it was Michael Eisner (chairman 
of Disney, the studio that makes the show), this issue was forced." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. "Carol &amp; Company," which has averaged 28% of the TV audience, 
arrived with the odds stacked against it -- except for a good lead-in from 
"Empty Nest." Burnett liked the anthology idea, and so did Eisner. But the form 
was dead in network TV -- with ratings failures in recent years including 
Steven Spielberg's "Amazing Stories" and revivals of "The Twilight Zone" and 
"Alfred Hitchcock Presents." 
</P>
<P>
At times, Burnett sounds like a voice in the wilderness. She knows networks are 
terrified that straight musical shows will die, but she blithely keeps going 
her own way: "My idea of heaven would be to get Angela Lansbury and Tracey 
Ullman and me just to do a special together -- just sing and kick up our heels. 
Tracey is probably the most versatile performer we have today. She's the best." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett's not bad, either. And her importance to NBC is suddenly magnified as 
the network's Thursday lineup faces the possible end of "Cheers" and the aging 
of "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," starring rapper Will Smith, isn't yet 
anywhere near the ratings hit that NBC thought it would be; in fact, it's 
struggling. That all gives a lot of importance to "The Golden Girls," "Empty 
Nest" and "Carol &amp; Company." 
</P>
<P>
"But it's hard," Burnett says of her anthology series. "It's like doing a 
22-minute pilot a week. It's from scratch every week." 
</P>
<P>
And that unpredictability -- and unevenness at times -- is what keeps it 
intriguing. It's a real TV risk. Tonight, for example, Burnett plays what NBC 
calls a "sex-crazed senior citizen." 
</P>
<P>
"She's not," Burnett says with a laugh. "Well, she's a little horny. But so was 
my grandmother. In fact, when my grandmother -- who raised me -- died at 81, 
she had a 40-year-old boyfriend who was a jazz musician over in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"But you know where this idea came from? We sit around the table and we 
spitball ideas. And Marcia (co-producer Marcia Brandwynne) started talking 
about the infantilization of senior citizens in some retirement homes, where 
people keep apart seniors who might have a crush on each other. And then there 
are their middle-aged children, who treat their parents as if they're infants. 
So I'm an 82-year-old woman who flirts and has boyfriends in this home. It's a 
valid premise." 
</P>
<P>
And it's part of an encouraging transformation on Saturday nights. Suddenly, 
the 10-to-11 p.m. Saturday time period -- normally the lowest-watched network 
hour -- has an intriguing lineup. ABC will offer "Twin Peaks" in that slot this 
season. CBS has Dan Rather's "48 Hours" newsmagazine starting tonight. And NBC 
has Burnett followed by "American Dreamer," a new Robert Urich sitcom with 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett's not happy being against "Twin Peaks." She'd rather appear on it: 
"Yeah. And it's opposite us. I mean, that's awful. I love that show. I hope 
they move it. If we're canceled, I'm going to be at (producer) David Lynch's 
door so fast." 
</P>
<P>
But now that Burnett's back in weekly harness, she has her own production 
company gearing up as well -- including motion picture plans for her published 
memoirs "One More Time" and her old Broadway hit and TV special "Once Upon a 
Mattress," based on the fairy tale "The Princess and the Pea." 
</P>
<P>
"The second draft of 'One More Time' is being written now," Burnett says. 
"We're in an agreement with Barry Levinson (director of 'Rain Man'). It would 
really be about the relationship between the three generations -- the little 
girl, me, from say about 11 to 19, and my mother and grandmother. It's about 
these three females living together in Hollywood, a block north of Hollywood 
Boulevard but a million miles away from the Hollywood dream. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother came out here from Texas wanting to be a writer -- she wanted to 
interview celebrities, and she worked at Fox for a while. She and my dad were 
divorced. And we lived in a one-room apartment at Yucca and Wilcox. And it's 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
There's a possibility that Burnett might play her grandmother -- "if I thought 
I could. I don't know that I can. I don't know." Would she play any other part? 
"No." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett smiles as she remembers her grandmother: "Oh, she'd steal stuff from 
Thrifty's. She'd steal napkins and salt-and-pepper shakers and flatware -- she 
had this big purse like Mary Poppins. And then we'd go see the movies -- we'd 
see eight movies a week on Hollywood Boulevard. And we'd go to the john, and 
she'd steal all the toilet paper and put it in her purse. I mean, we were on 
welfare. She was a hoot, that one. She knew how to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Professionally and personally, Burnett is clearly a survivor too. In the past, 
she says, she had "buffers." 
</P>
<P>
"I had Garry Moore when I was on his TV show. And on the Burnett show, Joe (her 
former husband Joe Hamilton) produced it and had to handle whatever else was 
going on." She never had to deal, she says, with those gray business eminences 
she calls "The Suits." 
</P>
<P>
But now, she says, she's leaning on herself more: "For one thing, I'm not 
married to the producer anymore. And for another, it's a whole different age 
for women. I was the little woman and came in and did my stuff. Joe did 
encourage me to come to meetings. But I didn't want to because there was no way 
I could say to somebody, 'I don't really like this sketch.' I just couldn't do 
it. I would hem and haw and be embarrassed and think that I was being tough. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm able to say, 'I'm not comfortable in this.' And I'm not killing 
anybody by saying it. And I'm not emasculating anybody. The best thing is to be 
honest. So I've been learning to speak up."

NOISE HURTS CSU INTEREST IN TOP SITE; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS SAY THE SAKIOKA FARMS PROPERTY IS ONLY A MILE FROM 
THE WEST END OF THE RUNWAY AT CAMARILLO AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An Oxnard farm that was ranked Sept. 7 as the best location for a new Cal State 
University in Ventura County may be disqualified because of noise from the 
nearby Camarillo Airport, a university official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sakioka Farms property, which includes more than 400 acres of agricultural 
land surrounded by industrial developments east of Rice Road and south of the 
Ventura Freeway, is less than a mile from the west end of the Camarillo Airport 
runway, said David Leveille, director of Cal State's institutional relations. 
</P>
<P>
Leveille said the state Department of Transportation was expected to decide 
next week whether the location would bring the university too close to the 
noisy runway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's right under the flight pattern," Leveille said. "The preliminary 
indications are that it's a no-go." 
</P>
<P>
The site would also be subjected to noise from the Ventura Freeway, which 
borders the property to the north, and from busy Rice Avenue to the east, which 
is the state's designated route to realign California 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The noise level would be extremely heavy," Leveille said. 
</P>
<P>
Property known as the Duntley Trust, north of Central Avenue and east of Santa 
Clara Avenue, is far more suitable, he said. Sakioka also owns 277 acres near 
the Duntley site and is interested in negotiating, Leveille said. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Boden, Camarillo planning director, said the city could work out a 
joint powers agreement with Oxnard and Ventura County so Oxnard would provide 
sewer services for the Duntley property, Camarillo would provide water and the 
university would remain on unincorporated county land. 
</P>
<P>
Leveille said potential problems at the site include its location in a flood 
plain that would be subject to flooding by heavy rains once every 500 years. It 
is also in the Camarillo/Oxnard greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
The officials made their comments Friday during a bus tour of eight potential 
university sites in Ventura County. The 37-member selection committee, made up 
of Cal State officials and Ventura County representatives, plans to narrow the 
potential sites to five or fewer at a meeting in Ventura on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State will then order an in-depth study of the environmental impacts a new 
university would bring to all the final sites, Cal State Vice Chancellor John 
Smart said. Cal State trustees will choose a final site after the environmental 
report is complete, Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State officials want at least 200 acres to build a campus that would 
eventually serve 15,000 students. They seek a location west of the Conejo Grade 
with 10-minute access from a major freeway. Officials also want willing 
property sellers and community support. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State had chosen the 450-acre Taylor Ranch west of Ventura. But the 
university was forced to all but abandon its plans in June after the Ventura 
City Council became divided on the issue and community opposition developed. 
</P>
<P>
University officials reopened the site selection process with 40 potential 
locations. On Sept. 7, the site selection committee narrowed the list to nine 
in addition to the Taylor Ranch, which Smart had said would be among the final 
sites considered. 
</P>
<P>
But neither he nor two Cal State trustees who took the tour Friday would 
confirm that the Taylor Ranch is still a potential site. The bus tour did not 
include Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced Friday that two other sites are no longer under 
consideration. The Hartman Ranch at the foot of the Conejo Grade had been 
withdrawn from consideration because of opposition from Camarillo, said Brian 
Boxer of EIP Associates, a Sacramento consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Walker/Hearne property, which had been included as part of the 
potential site known as the Hillside property, was also eliminated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Other sites toured Friday and still being considered are: 
</P>
<P>
* The Saticoy/Hillside site, between Saticoy Avenue and Kimball Road and 
straddling Foothill Road in northeast Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
* The Oxnard Boulevard site, 544 acres south of Gonzales Road, between Rose 
Avenue and Oxnard Boulevard in an unincorporated area of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
* The Lusk/McLaughlin property, 200 acres near the Ventura Harbor, north of 
Olivas Park Drive at Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* The Hugo McGrath property, 1,100 acres south of Gonzales Road at Harbor 
Boulevard in the Oxnard area. 
</P>
<P>
* The Diedrich/Donlon property, 590 acres west of Rice Avenue and north of 
Wooley Road in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
* The West Santa Paula site, the most remote of the locations, on hillside 
property south of the Santa Paula Freeway and west of 10th Street.

HORSE CAVALRY BUFFS BIVOUAC AT HOTEL TO TOAST GLORY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired Col. Pat Patterson has the answer to the gasoline shortage -- bring 
back the horse cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to have to come back," Patterson said, reminiscing about how he 
formed his own unofficial cavalry in Vietnam. "I used 275 Mongolian ponies and 
10 elephants to evacuate the wounded and carry supplies to places where 
helicopters couldn't land. And that was when we had gas." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson and other horse cavalry aficionados are bivouacked at a luxury hotel 
in Woodland Hills this weekend to celebrate the dashing figures in boots, blue 
coats, gold-striped pants and sabers, indelibly drawn and polished by John Ford 
in his classic trilogy. Friday, a transfixed audience watched one of the 
movies, "Rio Grande," starring a youthful John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day, 14th annual convention of the U.S. Horse Cavalry Assn. also 
includes a polo game and a ceremony honoring deceased cavalrymen -- who, 
according to legend, always stop for a drink of water on their way to hell, 
where they invariably end up because of their hard-living ways. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 300 people who flew in from as far away as Florida for the 
convention served in mechanized and air cavalry divisions of the U.S. Army 
during World War II and the Vietnam and Korean conflicts. Some have relatives 
who rode in the horse cavalry before it was dismounted in the early 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget when Dad lost his horse and got his Jeep, it was sad," said 
retired Maj. Gen. Jim Smith, 67, of St. Petersburg, Fla. "But we youngsters 
knew it had to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the convention is retired Col. Ed Ramsey, 73, who claims he led 
a cavalry charge on horseback in the Philippines on Jan. 16, 1942. Ramsey has 
just written a book called "Lieutenant Ramsey's War," detailing the story. 
</P>
<P>
"I divided the 27 men in my platoon into three squads to go down into the 
village when the Japanese opened fire," Ramsey said Friday in an interview. "I 
deployed the men into a line; we were at raised pistols, and I gave the order 
to charge into the village, right into the 100 or so Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a typical cavalry charge. We hit them instinctively. There was no 
hesitation -- my men were magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey's account may be accurate, but it has not been verified, said Dennis 
Vetock, a historian at the U.S. Army Military History Institute in Carlisle, 
Pa. The last documented cavalry charge was in 1916 in the search for Pancho 
Villa in Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cavalrymen in the Philippines ended up "eating most of their horses" 
because of a food shortage, Vetock said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ramsey said he and his men didn't eat the animals, including his chestnut 
gelding named Bryn Awryn, until after the battle at the Morong village. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey is one of the many people attending the convention who believe the horse 
cavalry has a role to play in modern warfare, particularly in remote places 
where vehicles cannot travel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a love affair with horses," said Vetock, adding jokingly, "but somebody 
had to clean the stables and they're forgetting that." 
</P>
<P>
The association was doing a brisk business Friday in horse souvenirs. 
Particularly popular were black, yellow and gold plastic bolo ties featuring 
the group's motto, "We Remember," and a reproduction of Western painter 
Frederic Remington's painting of a cavalryman in the group's heyday in the late 
1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about horses is they don't talk back to you and they're 
affectionate," said retired Col. Jim Spurrier of El Paso, who formed the 
association in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Life for the wives of cavalrymen in the West, where the mounted soldiers were 
fighting against the Indians, was a "glittering misery," said Gail Leonard, a 
Chino elementary school teacher and Western history buff, who gave a lecture 
Friday at the convention. "They were always being entertained by soldiers at 
the stations, but there were bugs, and it was dusty and dirty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But entire families shared a love for the service, she said. Paraphrasing a 
mid-1800s anonymous quotation by a British applicant for the cavalry, Retired 
Gen. James H. Polk of El Paso said, "The cavalry lent tone, dash and color to 
what otherwise would be a vulgar brawl."

WARRING ATTORNEYS MAKE BABY BOY JOHNSON A MEDIA STAR

<P>
Four days after his birth, Baby Boy Johnson is a media sensation, and his 
attorneys warned Friday that the ensuing publicity could mark him for life. 
</P>
<P>
"The child's right to privacy has been compromised by this three-ring circus," 
said William G. Steiner, the guardian appointed by the court to represent the 
baby during the custody battle between his genetic parents and the surrogate 
mother they hired for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over Baby Boy Johnson has now been chronicled by CBS News, Time and 
Newsweek magazines, the Washington Post, USA Today and scores of others. 
</P>
<P>
It has also been featured on Phil Donahue's and Geraldo Rivera's shows, 
prompted calls from the producers for Sally Jesse Raphael and Oprah Winfrey, 
and earned a page-and-a-half spread in the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Johnson case is expected to set legal precedent as the first 
custody case involving the surrogate mother of a "test-tube" baby, to whom she 
has no apparent genetic link. 
</P>
<P>
Media interest in Baby Boy Johnson has not reached the epic proportions of the 
landmark Baby M case, when about 100 reporters jammed a New Jersey courtroom to 
hear the verdict, according to one veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the clash of instinct, law and biotechnology drew nearly three 
dozen reporters, producers and photographers Friday to Orange County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, this is more interesting (than the Baby M case) because it's a 
more daring assertion by the surrogate mother in making a claim to the child," 
said Martin Kasindorf, Los Angeles reporter for New York-based Newsday. 
"Legally, it was unprecedented. It poses the question: What is parenting, 
anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
But other reporters predicted that national interest in the story would soon 
fade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good, interesting, compelling story -- and you do it once," said a 
correspondent for ABC who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, camera crews from CBS, NBC, ABC and CNN jockeyed with 
local TV reporters for the best angles and jostled print reporters aside with a 
ferocity usually reserved for Zsa Zsa Gabor or presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Similar maneuvers were conducted by attorneys for the various contenders. One 
by one, they emerged from the courtroom to confront the bank of cameras, each 
offering a slightly different interpretation of the day's legal events. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's attorney said Friday that the media war conducted by the attorneys 
had led some to make "untrue and inconsistent" statements that were further 
confusing an already-complicated case. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have lawyers more interested in publicity than in this child, it's 
absolutely unforgivable," attorney Harold LaFlamme said. "The one thing that 
surprises me right now is that they haven't sold tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Judge Richard N. Parslow told reporters that he would allow attorneys 
to work out procedural questions off camera, in his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"Given what I've seen so far in this week, I get a more candid response from 
the lawyers when they're with me in chambers than when it's a press 
conference-type atmosphere," Parslow said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would allow print reporters inside the courtroom but would 
limit the access of TV and still cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to concentrate in this case on what's going on," Parslow said, "and I 
can't have a din, either in here or out in the hallway. . . . A whole bunch of 
TV cameras would create a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the baby said they worried that the sensational aspects of the 
case could come back to haunt the child years after he is grown. "As children 
grow up, they want to know their roots, strengthen their sense of identity, 
their sense of belonging," Steiner said. "This child's sense of identity and 
belonging have been compromised." 
</P>
<P>
These concerns were echoed by Ben Bagdikian, professor emeritus of the UC 
Berkeley School of Journalism, who said the press should cover the case "with 
sensitivity and respect and with a maximum of serious information." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that publicity of any kind is going to dog this kid," he 
said. "But with sensationalist treatment of it, the kid will be seen as a freak 
instead of a human being who is put in this bizarre position." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Justin D. Call, a child psychiatrist who may be called as an expert witness 
in the trial, said the effect on the child is unpredictable and depends largely 
on the attitude, skills and maturity of his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on the breaks, so to speak, and the maturity of the child and 
the circumstances under which they learn the information," he said, adding that 
surrogacy may not be as unusual by the time Baby Boy Johnson is old enough to 
understand the facts of his complicated life. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in an age when science is moving ahead rapidly, and we may be in 
for even greater surprises in the future," Call said. 
</P>

story.

CRIME: THE PARENTS OF A MURDERED COLLEGE STUDENT THOUGHT THEY HAD WON A TOUGHER

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She turned the agony of her daughter's murder into a campaign to save other 
California college students from the deadly threats that lurk in dimly lit 
campus walkways and dark parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Genelle Reilley of Laguna Beach thought she had achieved a major victory last 
week when Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law a bill to set lighting 
standards for university and college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The euphoria was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Genelle and John Reilley said the legislation they believed might have 
saved their daughter's life four years ago would, in fact, do nothing for the 
more than 100 community college, state university and University of California 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
They said the new law, although a constructive first step, only sets standards 
for state campuses built in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It amazed me that the very people who should be concerned about the safety of 
our sons and daughters -- and you would think they would be our greatest allies 
-- are in fact our greatest enemies," said Genelle Reilley. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband blame University of California administrators who opposed 
as too costly the original bill, which would have required new lighting for 
existing campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no problem finding the money for sports, new buildings and other 
non-academic trivia while our children remain at risk," Genelle Reilley said. 
"Lighting is a deterrent to crime. If they can find the money to light up 
football fields they can find money to light up the walkways and parking lots." 
</P>
<P>
On the cold night of Jan. 18, 1986, Reilley's 23-year-old daughter, Robbin 
Brandley, was stabbed repeatedly as she returned to her car in a dark parking 
lot at Saddleback Community College. Her fully clothed body was found by her 
car where she had bled to death. Her assailant was never found. 
</P>
<P>
The night of the attack, Brandley -- a popular student disc jockey for KSBR-FM 
-- had volunteered as an usher for a piano concert and reception at the 
school's Doyle G. McKinney Theatre. She was returning to her car, about 100 
yards from the theater when she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said her bill (SB-1912) originally 
would have required all state college campuses to adopt a lighting standard for 
walkways and parking lots. But Bergeson, the Republican nominee for lieutenant 
governor, said the bill was opposed by university administrators not on its 
merits, but its cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very strongly that all the campuses should be included," Bergeson said, 
"but it was a matter of either forgetting about the bill altogether or getting 
a lighting standard for new campuses that can be applied retroactively later." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Greenspan, an analyst for the University of California office of state 
governmental relations, said he thought most of the university's lots were 
well-lighted and that the university did not oppose the idea of the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We pointed out that it could cost between $7.5 million and $15 million," 
Greenspan said. "That's a lot of money" in a time of tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The Reilleys claim the University of California campuses they visited at night 
were among those with the worst lighting. They cited an attempted rape at UC 
Irvine on Dec. 7, 1989, when a knife-wielding man forced a 22-year-old female 
student into a men's room and asked her to orally copulate him. 
</P>
<P>
She told police she was walking along a path in the middle of the UCI campus at 
night when she stopped to ask a man for directions. After he unsuccessfully 
attempted to rape her, he tried to force her in his van. Police said the woman 
broke free and fled. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new lighting law, the state architect, state police, the Department 
of General Services, the California Building Standards Commission and members 
of the public named by the governor will have until June 30, 1991, to come up 
with lighting standards for future campuses in California. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said Friday that she would see to it that another bill would be 
introduced next year to apply the lighting standard to all existing community 
college, state university and University of California campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Tragic stories like Robbin Brandley's are becoming far too common," Bergeson 
said. "One out of five college students is a victim of a violent crime. It is 
imperative that a lighting standard be set to do away with poorly lighted 
school walkways and parking lots. This is a necessary first step to deter crime 
at our college campuses." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Robbin Brandley's death, the Reilleys have sought to assuage their 
pain over their daughter's loss by pushing for campus security reforms. 
</P>
<P>
They testified in Sacramento in support of a bill that would have required 
colleges to submit a list of all recent crimes to enrolling students. The bill 
passed the Senate and Assembly only to be vetoed by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that you would stress that we are not giving up on campus 
safety," said John Reilley. "We regard the passage of the lighting bill as a 
positive, constructive first step. We believe that opposition will stop as more 
information about campus crime, and how to prevent it, becomes available to the 
public. We will concentrate on student groups for support in backing stronger 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
"This family is not giving up," concluded Genelle Reilley. "It is too late for 
our daughter, but we don't want this to happen to anyone else's child or 
grandchild."

IRVINE FIRM AGREES BLUM STOCK SALE WAS PROPER 
</P>

<P>
The $2.7-million sale of an Orange County company's stock last year by Richard 
C. Blum, the husband and chief financial backer of gubernatorial candidate 
Dianne Feinstein, was completely proper, a spokesman for the company said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Blum sold the stock in March, 1989 -- on the eve of a management shake-up that 
caused an immediate plunge in the value of the company's stock. Blum, a 
director and major stockholder of Irvine-based National Education Corp., has 
said he had no advance word of the announcement and did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But with questions on the transaction being raised because of Blum's leading 
role in paying for the Feinstein Democratic campaign, the company issued a 
statement agreeing with Blum's contention that he had acted properly. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has looked into the matter and, to the best of its knowledge, Mr. 
Blum in no way acted improperly," said Steven I. Baser, National Education 
Corp.'s senior corporate counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Baser, reading from the prepared statement, added, "Further, we understand that 
the (Securities and Exchange Commission) reviewed the matter and presumably 
reached the same conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
The existence of investigative interest by the SEC was first confirmed last 
week by Blum, who said he and other company officials had been questioned "some 
months ago." 
</P>
<P>
SEC representatives declined again Friday to say whether the agency has 
investigated, is investigating or will do so. 
</P>
<P>
Based on federal records, The Times reported Sept. 14 that Blum sold the $2.7 
million in stock during the two days before the company announced that its 
president was resigning. The announcement, the firm has acknowledged, caused 
its stock value to drop immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Blum, who continues to control more stock than any other director of the 
company, has said he was skiing in Squaw Valley at the time of the sale and had 
no inkling of the impending resignation before he sold the stock, on March 14 
and March 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
His actions, he said, complied with federal law barring corporate insiders from 
exploiting information not available to all shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
National Education Corp. announced the resignation of its president, Jerome W. 
Cwiertnia, on March 16, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Blum and other company officials said no inferences should be 
drawn from the fact that the company obtained just 46% reimbursement from an 
insurance carrier for costs stemming from a 1989 shareholder lawsuit that named 
Blum, three other directors and the company as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey A. Brill, the company's general counsel, said the company is satisfied 
with its ability to get the reimbursement. The case was settled in March before 
going to trial when the company -- while describing the litigation as 
groundless -- agreed to pay the plaintiffs $11,850,000. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged violations of federal securities law, fraud and 
misrepresentations of the company's true financial posture. The lawsuit said 
the company issued rosy financial information for the firm at the same time 
that several directors, including Blum, were selling stock. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the stock selling that was at issue in the lawsuit was conducted by 
Blum, and he was the only director to sell stock in the days immediately before 
the March 16, 1989, management announcement. 
</P>
<P>
National Education Corp. said at the time of the March settlement that it would 
"vigorously pursue" a claim for reimbursement with its insurance carrier, which 
was then refusing to pay any part of the $11.8-million settlement. Four months 
later, in July, National Education Corp. announced it had agreed to accept the 
insurance company's offer of $5.5 million -- 46% of the $11.85 million paid to 
the shareholders who sued. 
</P>
<P>
Brill, the company's general counsel, said that in his view the insurance 
company's refusal to pay a larger portion of the settlement was not related to 
the accusations of wrongdoing contained in the shareholders' lawsuit. Brill 
also noted that the four directors -- but not the company itself -- were 
insured. 
</P>
<P>
Brill acknowledged that the insurance policy in question states specifically 
that the firm will not be indemnified if directors violate federal securities 
law or engage in other wrongdoing. But Brill said that provision has no bearing 
on the company's ability to collect just 46% of the settlement cost. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance carrier -- the Chubb Group -- continues to provide insurance for 
National Education Corp., according to others familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Jones, national manager of executive protection for the Chubb Group of 
Insurance Companies in Warren, N.J., said company practice bars him from 
commenting on its relationship with any insured party, including National 
Education Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Blum, in a statement relayed by Feinstein's campaign manager, said that "the 
insurance company fulfilled its obligation to protect" the four directors named 
in the shareholders' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"However," Blum added, "since the policy does not insure the company itself, 
the company paid a portion of the settlement."

FAX IS THE MAX FOR GETTING CLOSE TO TROOPS IN GULF 
</P>

<P>
Grateful, and sometimes tearful, friends and relatives of troops stationed in 
the Persian Gulf took advantage Friday of a new American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph service allowing them to fax messages to their loved ones free. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 people, mostly wives and girlfriends of servicemen from El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, sent messages from the AT&amp;T Phone Center at the 
MainPlace shopping mall. With their children clutching baby bottles and darting 
between phone displays, mothers watched as their letters were fed into fax 
machines festooned with yellow ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was repeated in more than 400 other locations nationwide, and an 
estimated 3,000 people used the service, called DESERT FAX, AT&amp;T 
spokeswoman Daylanne Jackson said. The project will cost AT&amp;T more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so touching. As they're faxing, tears come into their eyes," said store 
manager Elaine Diersing at the AT&amp;T Phone Center in Santa Ana. "They're 
putting in pictures of their kids, and the kids are drawing pictures that say, 
'To daddy.' One woman came in here (Friday) morning, and she's coming back this 
afternoon with her kids." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Weiss, 38, and her son, Billy, sent her husband, Marine Capt. William 
John Weiss, a letter that said: "Keep your spirits high and your head low! We 
will roll out the red carpet on your return home. With love always, Karen and 
Billy." The letter included an illustration of a caped Cleveland Browns player, 
Ozzie Newsome, wearing No. 82, and the phrase, "Go Browns!" repeated five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"(Browns quarterback) Bernie Kosar is his favorite player, but I couldn't get a 
picture of him. Eighty-two is Billy's number," Weiss said. "If I could send him 
anything, besides myself, it would be a six-pack of beer and a videotape of a 
Cleveland Browns game. One that they won." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said the fax program would increase morale of both the families at home 
and the servicemen stationed abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"If the husbands know the wives are fine, they can withstand anything," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fax service allows letters to be delivered to troops up to a week sooner 
than the 10 to 12 days it takes for regular mail, Diersing said. And it will 
remain in operation indefinitely, enabling families and friends to send 
single-page messages from any of 29 locations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote to let him know we miss him and hope to see him real soon," Aretha 
Scott, 30, of El Toro said of her husband, Marine Staff Sgt. M.A. Scott. "I'm 
not worried -- very positive about the whole situation. He can take care of 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Others, though, were not as confident. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very worried about him going into war and chemicals," Joannie Beaver, 30, 
said of her husband, Frank. 
</P>
<P>
Beaver's two sons, Anthony and Frank, ages 2 and 3, watched intently as the 
letter was fed into the fax machine. Anthony had drawn a heart and signed his 
name in large capital letters with some help from his mom. 
</P>
<P>
"They talk about him all the time," Beaver said. "They ask about him and want 
to know when he's coming back. We wrote just to tell him we love him and miss 
him and mushy, mushy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Hinz, 23, of El Toro said she sent a message to her fiance, Sgt. Michael 
Maxwell. The couple had to postpone their August wedding indefinitely because 
of his assignment to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have a wedding when he and all his best men are going," Hinz said. 
"I always worry about him. I'm worried that he's working too hard. I'm worried 
that he's not eating right. I'm worried that we're going to war. I'm worried 
that it's too hot for him." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Keel-Burke, 23, accompanied Hinz and faxed her own letter to her husband, 
Marine Sgt. Scott Burke, who serves on C-130 cargo planes with Hinz's fiance. 
</P>
<P>
"When they get this, it will be a surprise. It'll make their day," Hinz 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hinz and Keel-Burke praised the new program, they added that it would 
not replace phone calls, on which they have each spent as much as $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people can't talk to their husbands or boyfriends, but if I couldn't 
talk to him, I'd be down here every day (to fax messages)," Keel-Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to hear their voice," Hinz added. "Sometimes it gets so bad you want 
to pull your hair out."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;

CITY GETS AWARD FOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION

<P>
When Councilwoman Clarice A. Blamer arrived at a recent convention of the 
International Downtown Assn., few of the participants had ever heard of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the affair closed, the small city had claimed its share of the 
spotlight, earning one of 15 association awards. 
</P>
<P>
Brea was recognized for the design and planning process it employed in 
redeveloping its downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Chosen from more than 65 entries, the city was one of just two small cities 
recognized, the other being Escondido. Other winning cities included Los 
Angeles, Orlando, Baltimore, St. Paul and Phoenix. Blamer presented the award 
to Mayor Carrey J. Nelson this week.

Brea was chosen for its Downtown Charette, a citizens' group appointed by the 
council to help plan and design the new downtown. The word charette means a 
time-limited process that brings outside planning, design and architectural 
professionals to a particular site to work on a design problem. Working in 
small groups, the 150 members made numerous recommendations to architects, 
planners and others hired by the city to develop the master plan for the new 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the ideas presented by the charette and incorporated into the plan 
include providing a pedestrian environment, housing in the downtown area, and 
round-the-clock entertainment and recreational areas for people of all ages.

HOUSING PROPOSAL TO GO TO COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After weathering four drawn-out hearings by the Planning Commission, a massive 
new housing development proposed by the Irvine Co. finally goes to the City 
Council next week. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the Westpark II development would add 3,626 homes to the existing 
Westpark village, increasing the city's population by about 7,250 residents. 
That would be the equivalent of about 7%, and to accommodate such a growth 
spurt, the development would include two elementary schools, five parks and two 
child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which would be built by the Irvine Co., cleared an important 
hurdle Thursday night, when it won approval from the Planning Commission after 
a series of public hearings. That sent the measure to the council, but final 
action is not expected soon because of the complexity and size of the project. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of issues have dogged the proposal from the beginning, and the 
Planning Commission on Thursday addressed the question of how much housing 
should be reserved for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
City planners had suggested that commissioners require at least 5% of the units 
in Westpark II to be affordable to families earning half the median county 
income or less, with another 5% built if the city provided the financing. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Lowell S. Johnson proposed eliminating the 5% requirement, a 
move the commission approved by a 3-2 vote. Under Johnson's recommendation, 
which must be reviewed by the City Council, the Irvine Co. would have to make 
10% of the units affordable to low-income buyers, but only if the city provides 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Effat Mansour and Kate Clark, who have argued that the 
requirement is needed if the city hopes to increase its low-income housing 
supply, voted against Johnson's change. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring low-income housing without providing the financing would only 
increase the price of all homes in Westpark II, Johnson said. The Irvine Co. 
would have to subsidize the lower-income units by raising prices on the rest of 
the homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddling future residents with a large bill to accommodate affordable housing 
is not fair or equitable in my eyes," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
A fairer way of providing low-income housing would be to sell municipal bonds, 
spreading the cost to all city residents instead of concentrating it on new 
homeowners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides low-income housing, commissioners also have questioned whether there 
might be health hazards created by 220,000-volt electrical power lines along 
Harvard Avenue. The board also raised concerns about noise from Marine 
helicopters flying over the area. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the city and Irvine Co. agreed to compromises that they say will 
protect residents while still letting the development proceed. TOM McQUEENEY

DEPUTIES ARREST HIT-RUN SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 33-year-old Dana Point man was arrested Friday at a San Bernardino County 
home on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, according to sheriff's officials. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy William Underwood, who was described as a self-employed artist, was 
arrested about 4:45 a.m. after his blue Honda was traced to a home in Grand 
Terrace, said Lt. Richard J. Olson of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood is scheduled to be arraigned Monday, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood is suspected of running into Charlotte Ann Englis, 66, of Laguna 
Beach while she was riding her bicycle about 3:45 p.m. Aug. 31 near the 
intersection of Del Obispo Street and Windjammer Drive in San Juan Capistrano. 
According to witnesses, Underwood stopped momentarily to ask the victim if she 
was hurt and then left the scene, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
A license plate fell off Underwood's 1982 Honda during the accident, enabling 
deputies to trace the vehicle to a Dana Point residence and then to Grand 
Terrace, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Englis suffered a concussion, a broken right ankle and abrasions in the 
accident, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for Underwood was set at $10,000.

If Earth Day '90 is fading from memory, this ought to ring a bell. In the 1989 
Adopt-A-Beach cleanup, the Center for Marine Conservation reports that 12 kinds 
of litter made up 80% of the total trash collected by volunteers. Cigarette 
butts and Styrofoam pieces alone accounted for about half. Here's a more 
detailed look:

ONCE-BANNED BOOKS WILL GET READINGS AT SADDLEBACK

Saddleback College President Constance Carroll will lead off a weeklong campus 
defense of free expression Monday as Saddleback students, teachers and 
administrators will read aloud passages from books once banned somewhere in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice and Wonderland," "The Grapes of Wrath" and "Women in Love" will be among 
the first books to be excerpted for Banned Books Week. Each was once considered 
dangerous in this country, and each has at times been outlawed from libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show people that maybe censorship is more dangerous than the ideas 
themselves are," said Brenda Lamanuzzi, a member of the Friends of the 
Saddleback Library, which is sponsoring the event. "We want people to be aware 
of the freedom to read. We're hoping more campuses will follow our lead and 
acknowledge Banned Book Day." 
</P>
<P>
Banned Books Week has been observed at schools and libraries nationally for the 
last eight years as part of an annual campaign by the American Library Assn. to 
remind patrons of their "right to read." 
</P>
<P>
Although Saddleback College's library is the only one in the county holding 
such a reading event this year, libraries at UC Irvine and Orange Coast College 
in Costa Mesa will display once-prohibited books as part of exhibits marking 
Banned Books Week. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll will start the Saddleback event at 11:45 a.m., introducing students, 
teachers and community members who will read. Each reader will be given seven 
minutes to read a passage the reader picks from a book once considered 
"dangerous," Lamanuzzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Other scheduled activities include a speech by Times columnist Jack Smith; 
screenings of films such as "Fahrenheit 451," which is about book-burnings and 
a closed society, and an exhibit of recently outlawed books such as "The Color 
Purple" and "The Catcher in the Rye." 
</P>
<P>
Event organizers are also holding an Author-Title Matchup contest, awarding a 
free book to whoever matches the most banned book titles with the names of 
their respective authors. 
</P>
<P>
Other books to be included in the read-out are "Of Mice and Men," "Flowers for 
Algernon," "Another Country," "Grendel," "To Kill a Mockingbird," "The Great 
Gatsby," "The Jungle" and "A Light in the Attic."

<P>
For two years now, the friends of Renee Lacouague-Bondi have gathered to Rally 
Round Renee. They raised $8,000 at the Coach House on Monday night, and plan to 
hold another benefit for her there Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of a San Juan Capistrano family whose ancestors settled here near 
the turn of the century, Lacouague-Bondi went to the Mission School, directed 
the mission's youth choirs, and was a music teacher at San Clemente High School 
before her life changed suddenly on May 16, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
On that Sunday evening -- just a day after her future husband, Mike Bondi, gave 
her an engagement ring -- she went to bed and suffered a serious accident in 
her sleep. Somehow, she fell out of bed and broke her neck, causing a spinal 
injury that threatened to turn her into a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
For two months, she had no sensation from her neck down. Then began the first 
hints of a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lying in a Long Beach hospital, and I felt a little muscle contraction 
in my left arm," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Renee Lacouague-Bondi, 32, and her husband live in a new home next door 
to her parents. Sitting upright in a wheelchair and having regained the use of 
her shoulders and arms, she is an example of the rewards of daily physical 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it step by step," she said. "I've always been that way, maybe because 
of my training as a teacher. Instead of taking on a humongous project all at 
once, I chip away at it. But my first thought was that I wanted to sit up and 
sing, and I'd worry about walking later." 
</P>
<P>
Since the days of choir at Mission San Juan Capistrano, singing has been a part 
of her life. Before her accident, she was a five-year member of the Young 
Americans touring group, traveling and performing around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"She was always a very active and independent girl. She was always on the go -- 
always," says her mother, Marie Lacouague. "She still is that way, which I 
think is very good for her." 
</P>
<P>
Now, instead of teaching in the Capistrano Unified School District, she has 
returned to the mission, once again directing the youth choirs. The physical 
part of conducting the choirs is part of her therapy process, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The mission has always been there for me. Somehow, my life always comes back 
to that mission," she said. "But conducting has been very good for me. It's a 
physical act, like an exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Two years after her accident and the upheaval in her life, Lacouague-Bondi 
still submits to the frustration it has all caused her and her family. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it hits me, like the other night when I was preparing for bed, and I 
get mad. I think, 'What the hell am I doing this way?' All I want to do is get 
up, walk in the bathroom and wash my face and go to bed," she explained. "The 
whole thing still blows me away." 
</P>
<P>
But the saving graces in her situation, besides the mission, have been her 
family, her daily attendant, Carol Hamilton, and her husband, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is one incredible man," she said. "He has said he would stand by me 
through everything and he has." 
</P>
<P>
Her friends and alumni of the Young Americans are gathered in the South County 
for this year's benefit performances. Last year, the six parents who make up 
the core of the Rally Round Renee group raised $35,000 to buy her a 
specially-equipped van. This year their goal is $15,000 to $20,000, enough to 
pay for her attendant five days a week, said Monica Hunnicutt. 
</P>
<P>
"We've estimated that will pay for attendant care for one year," Hunnicutt 
said. "We'll wait and see next year what else we can do." 
</P>
<P>
At the Coach House benefit on Oct. 1, Lacouague-Bondi will also perform. The 
benefit earlier this week was "absolutely wonderful," Hunnicutt said, although 
the house was only half full. 
</P>
<P>
"We got together right after the accident," Hunnicutt explained, "because we 
were hurting and our children, who were students of Renee's, were hurting. We 
all loved Renee so much. We got together to talk things out, to comfort 
ourselves and our children, and Rally Round Renee was the outgrowth of that."

CRIME: A JUDGE RELUCTANTLY PREVENTS A STATE PRISON TERM FOR THE 17-YEAR-OLD 
CONVICTED OF KILLING HIS ROOMMATE.

<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald set aside his personal views Friday 
and sentenced a 17-year-old Huntington Beach youth to the California Youth 
Authority instead of state prison for shooting to death his roommate almost two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Applegate, who turns 18 this month, will be freed from custody when he 
turns 25. He was convicted by a jury four months ago of first-degree murder in 
the Jan. 8, 1989, shooting of Paul Londono, 25, whose body was burned beyond 
recognition and left on a beach. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence outraged the victim's family, who considered the punishment far 
too lenient. Fitzgerald told The Times later that he agreed with them. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid deserves a much stiffer sentence for what he did," Fitzgerald said. 
"It was a vicious, vicious killing. . . . I understand how the (Londono) family 
feels." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was limited, though, by a unanimous recommendation in a Youth 
Authority diagnostic study that Applegate should serve his entire sentence in a 
juvenile facility. Applegate was 16 at the time of the murder, but he was tried 
as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate testified that he had been physically and sexually abused by Londono 
and could never have escaped him unless he killed him. Dr. A.S. Atesalp, a 
Youth Authority psychologist who participated in the diagnostic study, wrote 
that "killing his tormentor was the only solution he thought was left to him, 
subject to repeated degradations, humiliation, and physical abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald, who technically sentenced Applegate to 27 years to life, had two 
other options. He could have sent Applegate to state prison, which would have 
assured no release before he was in his early 30s, or he could have ordered a 
prison term in which Applegate would serve the first part of his sentence at a 
juvenile facility until he was 25. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that if he ignored the study's recommendation, the appellate 
courts would reverse his decision on the grounds that he abused his discretion. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could have found some way to get around it, I would have sent him to 
prison," Fitzgerald said. "But with a unanimous recommendation, I just couldn't 
ignore what the Youth Authority had to say." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick H. Donahue said the jury rejected Applegate's 
molestation claims by returning the first-degree murder verdict. But Deputy 
Public Defender Carol Lavacot said the diagnostic study makes it clear that her 
client told the truth about being sexually molested. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a tragedy to send Brian to prison," she said. "He's already 
come a long way through counseling. I think he's really going to shine when he 
gets out." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the victim's family claims that the Applegate case has made a 
mockery of the criminal justice system. Through heavy sobs, Londono's mother, 
Jenny Londono, said after the sentencing: "Murderers go free in this county." 
</P>
<P>
The victim's sister, Martha Pagano, called the judicial system "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
"We went through all the headache of getting him tried as an adult, and now he 
is going to serve his time with little boys," she said. "What good did it do to 
bring it to adult court?" 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor told the family: "I'm not going to blast the judge for what he 
did. I told the jury not to consider punishment because that was the judge's 
job. It would be hypocritical for me now to say anything about his decision." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue, who had asked for a state prison sentence, said he was concerned that 
Applegate cannot be rehabilitated by age 25 -- "I really wonder if this is the 
kind of guy you take a chance on." 
</P>
<P>
Lavacot said she had felt so sorry for the victim's mother after the 
preliminary hearing that she had bought a book on grief by C.S. Lewis, 
gift-wrapped it, and gave it to the woman in an attempt to help her. Friday in 
court, Londono angrily tossed it back to her, still wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how she feels, but they are blinded about who Paul Londono really was," 
Lavacot said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Lavacot claims that her client is not gay, Londono and Applegate met at 
a gay bar in Florida where Applegate worked. They moved to Southern California 
together a few months before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence showed that Applegate shot Londono while Londono slept in bed at 
their apartment. Then he hauled the body to the beach in a sleeping bag, where 
he ignited it with gasoline. The body remained unidentified, although police 
had a missing person's report from the Londono family. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were unaware that Applegate had killed anyone until a few months 
later, when his new roommates noticed bloodstains on some bedding. Eventually 
confronted by police, Applegate confessed to the shooting and identified the 
burned body as Londono's.

JUDGE REFUSES TO LOWER $5-MILLION BAIL FOR KEATING; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: KEY FIGURE IN COLLAPSE OF LINCOLN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN IS DEEMED A FLIGHT 
RISK AND IS ASSURED OF MORE JAIL TIME. BAIL IS LOWERED FOR THREE OF HIS 
CO-DEFENDANTS.

<P>
A Los Angeles judge Friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for Charles H. 
Keating Jr., saying the Phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being 
indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner said Keating -- pursued by creditors, 
regulators and prosecutors for his role in the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan -- has "significant reasons not to stay around." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that the 66-year-old Keating -- a once-wealthy real estate 
developer, lawyer and influential political campaign contributor used to 
pin-striped suits -- will spend more time in blue prison fatigues inside Los 
Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Klausner reduced bail for three Keating co-defendants from 
the $1 million he imposed Tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the 
former operators of American Continental Corp. and its former main subsidiary, 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for Judy J. Wischer, 42, former American Continental president, was 
lowered to $200,000. Bail for Robin S. Symes, 37, and Ray C. Fidel, 32, both 
former Lincoln presidents, was cut to $100,000. All three posted bail late 
Friday and were expected to be released during the night. 
</P>
<P>
The four are charged with wrongdoing in the sale of more than $200 million in 
American Continental bonds to thousands of mostly elderly Southern California 
investors. The bonds were sold through Lincoln branches, allegedly as safe and 
insured investments. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds became worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy in 
April, 1989. The next day Lincoln was declared insolvent and seized by federal 
regulators. The failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, indicated he would appeal Klausner's 
ruling. Keating will not flee and intends to fight to clear his name, Neal 
said. But the decision denies Keating access to his attorneys and to records so 
he can mount a defense effectively, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (the decision) is unsupportable on the evidence that was introduced 
this week," Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had sought to have bail reduced to $500,000, an amount that could be 
paid by his family, Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
Neal argued that Keating, who three years ago had a net worth of nearly $40 
million, is broke. Keating's former accountant testified that his debts exceed 
his assets by $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice 
in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce 
Keating's bail. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Keating is accused of cheating people out of their savings," Reiner said 
in a press conference after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"For many of them, it was their life savings. And whether somebody wears an 
expensive suit or a cheap mask, stealing is stealing and both of them ought to 
be treated the same." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision came after 1 1/2 days of testimony and arguments in the 
first criminal case to be filed in connection with the collapses of Lincoln and 
Phoenix-based American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, unshaven and looking tired, sat impassively in the prisoners' block as 
the judge announced his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Donald Smaltz, attorney for Symes, criticized Reiner and Klausner 
for their handling of the bail hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The most talked about event in the last several weeks has been the Iraqi 
invasion," Smaltz said. "The sole thing that replaced Saddam Hussein on the 
front page was Charles Keating, and Reiner's milking that for all it's worth." 
</P>
<P>
He also struck out at the judge, saying, "He's never going to get arrested for 
flashing his Phi Beta Kappa key. Bail is supposed to assure a defendant's 
appearance in court and must be within the means he could reasonably afford." 
</P>
<P>
Klausner also said he was "troubled" by the way the district attorney has 
equivocated on the bail issue. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when the indictments were unsealed, prosecutors did not object to 
releasing all the defendants on their own recognizance. On Wednesday, 
prosecutors said they were willing to recommend a reduction in bail to $1 
million for Keating and $50,000 for the others. Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul 
W. Turley argued against reducing the bail. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, who was appointed a special state prosecutor by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp to investigate Lincoln, said he was willing to let the defendants go 
without bail on Tuesday because he didn't want to face a difficult battle 
extraditing Keating from Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
After Klausner first ruled, Reiner said he then supported the bail set. But 
asked why his office changed his mind later, he said, "I'm not sure that I 
understand the semantic difference." 
</P>
<P>
While defense attorneys wouldn't say what they thought of the prosecutor's 
actions, other lawyers connected indirectly to the case scored Reiner for 
allegedly using the case and his changing views on Keating's bail to bolster 
his public image. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper 
bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing 
were the most important in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the hearing, defense attorneys brought witnesses and other evidence 
to court to show that their clients were destitute or nearly so. They argued 
that the defendants would return to court for trial to fight for their 
vindication, as they had stayed to fight the massive civil litigation filed 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and the others also have known they were targets of state and federal 
criminal investigations for a long time and would have fled the country by now 
if they had wanted to avoid prosecution, their attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
They also argued that the indictment contains no information about specific 
wrongdoing, alleging only violations of certain laws regarding the sale of 
American Continental debt securities at Lincoln offices to 20 people. The 
alleged crimes caused the victims to lose nearly $1.2 million, hardly serious 
enough to warrant such high bails, they contended. 
</P>
<P>
But Turley contended that the 20 people represented a much bigger group of 
investors who lost much more money, throwing in a new figure in the 
often-changing number of total victims. He said 17,458 small investors had 
bought $250 million in American Continental bonds at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
He reminded the court of "one major distinction" between this case and other 
thrift fraud cases. "The victims are individuals deprived of their own 
particular finances," he said, not taxpayers asked to foot the bill for the 
entire thrift debacle, now estimated at $500 billion over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said that, though his office had no evidence that Keating would flee, 
"you can't escape the thought of Mr. Robert Vesco in a case like this." Vesco, 
a New Jersey financier indicted in 1972 for allegedly defrauding four firms out 
of $224 million, fled the country and remains at large.

RECORD AMOUNT WITHDRAWN FROM S&amp;LS NATIONWIDE

Depositors withdrew a record $15.1 billion from the nation's savings and loans 
in April, the government said Friday in another confirmation of the rapid 
retrenchment gripping the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The net withdrawal, which was somewhat offset by $2.9 billion in interest 
credited to savers' accounts, reduced deposits at the 2,839 S&amp;Ls to $916 
billion, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record of $13.4 billion was set three months earlier. Before that, 
the record was $10.8 billion set in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the outflow, the 22nd in 23 months, primarily to the need 
to meet stiff capital standards imposed by last year's S&amp;L bailout law, 
among other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Few S&amp;Ls are earning much in profits, and they are having difficulty 
attracting new capital from investors. Thus, they must shrink their operations, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L assets totaled $1.21 trillion, down $12.9 billion from March and $133 
billion from a peak of $1.34 trillion in May. 
</P>
<P>
Other reasons cited include the normal April outflow as depositors pay federal 
tax bills, S&amp;Ls' reduced need for funds in a depressed housing market and 
government sale of S&amp;Ls to commercial banks.

JAPANESE STILL BUYING BUT IN SUBTLER WAYS; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT: FOREIGN MONEY IS GOING PAST THE 'TROPHIES' IN THE UNITED STATES AND 
TOWARD MORE SOPHISTICATED VENTURES. 
</P>

Japanese purchases of U.S. "trophies" such as Rockefeller Center and Columbia 
Pictures had slacked off until a Tokyo tycoon bought Pebble Beach Co., with its 
exquisite golf courses and lone cypress tree. 
</P>
<P>
But don't be deceived by fewer high-profile deals. The Japanese appetite for 
U.S. investment remains powerful, despite Japanese government pressure to tone 
down purchases and a nearly 40% drop in the value of stocks in that country 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Japanese are making more U.S. investments than ever, and more 
sophisticated ones, as they become confident enough to look past blue-chip 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
"They're becoming insiders in the United States," said Jack Barthell, a 
managing partner of the Los Angeles accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp; 
Co., which closely tracks Japanese investment. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is that more apparent than in real estate, Leventhal's specialty. 
Having moved from office buildings to hotels to resorts and golf courses, the 
Japanese are now developing property, often in partnership with U.S. companies, 
here and abroad, Barthell said. 
</P>
<P>
While their total real estate investment fell by 11% from 1988 to 1989, to 
$14.8 billion, "the volume of transactions was way up," Barthell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese also are moving from primary investment areas, such as Honolulu, 
Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, to other metro areas and the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
A Leventhal study showed that four-fifths of total investment was in the 
primary areas in 1985; by last year, the figure was about one-third. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding the very distinct move from the archetypal downtown trophy 
office tower to developing single-family residential in the suburbs, or even 
apartments," Barthell said. 
</P>
<P>
Another new target zone is Europe, where Japanese real estate investment last 
year was twice the level of 1988 and nearly 4 1/2 times that of 1987, according 
to Clark Whitehill, a British accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent example of the trends is the Japanese subsidiary Shuwa Investments 
Corp., which owns $2.7 billion in U.S. real estate. Shuwa led the charge into 
office towers, buying the ITT Corp. headquarters in New York, the U.S. News and 
World Report building in Washington, the Arco Plaza in Los Angeles, and the 
Quaker Tower in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But during the past year, Shuwa made different kinds of headlines: announcing 
plans to build luxury apartments in Los Angeles; forming a $154-million 
partnership with Los Angeles-based Tishman West Cos. in a London office 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers say the Japanese were surprised last year by the harshness of 
U.S. reaction to high-profile deals. Those included Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s 
$846-million purchase of a controlling stake in New York's Rockefeller Center, 
and Sony Corp.'s $3.4-billion purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative publicity, the Japanese still appear ready to buy U.S. 
landmarks if the circumstances are right. 
</P>
<P>
Those acquainted with this month's deal for Pebble Beach, where a round of golf 
can cost $175 and the scenic 17-Mile Drive winds past the often-photographed 
lone cypress, say competition was vicious between two final bidders, both 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, businessman Minoru Isutani bought the Monterey property for more than 
$800 million from a partnership that included Beverly Hills billionaire Marvin 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis' asking price was much higher, some say $1.2 billion. And Isutani is 
a special case. Because he owns an empire of golf clubs and sporting goods 
companies in Japan and abroad, he can exploit Pebble Beach with 
cross-memberships and marketing tie-ins of all sorts. 
</P>
<P>
So even the top-dollar price for Pebble Beach is not interpreted as a sign of a 
new rush for mega-deals. 
</P>
<P>
"The situations where a guy walked around Manhattan or Waikiki with a wad of 
money in his pocket and bought the first overpriced property are gone," said 
Daniel Schwartz, managing director at Ulmer Brothers Inc., a New York 
investment bank specializing in deals involving the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Research at Ulmer Brothers shows the trend extends beyond real estate to 
investing in and buying out U.S. businesses. In the first half of 1990, the 
company counted 103 such mergers and acquisitions. That compared with 74 in the 
first half of 1989 and 47 in the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the average deal size fell from $162 million in 1988 to $51 
million this year. That reflects the fact that the Japanese increasingly are 
taking minority stakes in U.S. businesses, often to provide new capital, 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of U.S. companies have found themselves in trouble, and the ones with 
money are overseas, the Japanese and Europeans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese also have become quicker to back away from overpriced deals, 
Schwartz noted. Whitman Corp. had hoped to get $700 million for its Hussmann 
Corp. commercial refrigerator unit in St. Louis, then pulled it off the market 
when Sanyo Electric Co.'s bid came in substantially lower, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Hilton Hotels Corp. removed its "for-sale" sign this year after bids 
came in far below the $120 per share some analysts expected. Several Japanese 
companies, including the leisure and real estate conglomerate EIE 
International, had been interested.

Riding High: A bumpy ride early on for Taco Bell's "Tacos to Go" campaign with 
cyclist Greg LeMond has apparently not hurt the company's regard for its 
advertising agency. Foote, Cone &amp; Belding of San Francisco, which won the 
$75-million to $80-million Taco Bell corporate account 16 months ago, has just 
completed a deal for the last of the Mexican fast-food chain's franchisee 
business, said Elliot Bloom, a Taco Bell spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell franchisees in the greater Los Angeles area, which pool their $10 
million in advertising, have just followed franchisees in Northern California 
and three other states to the doorstep of Foote, Cone, Bloom said. Adweek 
magazine reported this week that the franchisees are bringing a total of $30 
million in business to Foote, Cone, but Bloom would not confirm that number. 
</P>
<P>
The franchisees have drifted away from the Los Angeles office of the 
Tracy-Locke ad agency, since May, 1989, when Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine 
pulled its business from Dallas-based Tracy-Locke, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
The "Tacos to Go" campaign limped from the starting line in May, when the 
company recalled 300,000 LeMond-inscribed water bottles after receiving 
complaints that some children had pulled off the tiny plastic tops and could 
possibly choke on them. However, Minnesota-born LeMond obligingly boosted the 
campaign's fortunes this summer by winning the Tour de France for the third 
time.

With overseas markets growing "relentlessly" complex, a top Orange County 
computer executive Friday urged U.S. companies to join the global market while 
opportunities are abundant and urged Washington to set a global trade policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see an expanding world market this decade as opportunities in 
Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and the European Economic Community open 
up," said Roger W. Johnson, chairman and chief executive of Western Digital 
Corp. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"My concerns for American companies are (that) they may not be patient enough 
to cultivate foreign markets and (that) they are being driven by the financial 
markets -- that is, the stock market and their shareholders -- for quick 
returns," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks to more than 400 people attending an international business 
symposium co-sponsored by the World Trade Center Assn. of Orange County and the 
U.S. Small Business Administration, Johnson said the U.S. government plays a 
major role in helping American companies expand their markets abroad. He urged 
Washington policy-makers to set a trade policy covering the global market 
rather than setting policies on a country-by-country basis. 
</P>
<P>
"American policy-makers talk about the global market, but they are not 
accepting a global market approach," he said. "They still view the world market 
as individual countries the U.S. trades with. It is not working." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of encouraging U.S. companies to enter the world market, the existing 
policies have confused and discouraged many firms, Johnson said. And while 
addressing the trade issue, U.S. policy-makers may also have to revamp the U.S. 
capital gains tax to encourage companies to plan for the long term, he added, 
"just like what the Japanese are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Farooquee, president of CMS Enhancements Inc., a Tustin computer company, 
advised U.S. companies to liken ties with foreign firms to a marriage. "Once 
ties are made, it will last for many years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson urged companies to quit complaining about Japanese business practices 
and fix their own houses first. Western Digital, with sales last year of nearly 
$1 billion, does about half of its annual business overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't change foreign habits, so don't cry if you have a hard time getting 
into a market," Johnson said. "Do something to become competitive. Change the 
habit of short-term outlook and plan long term. Structure overseas operations 
on local markets and hire a local manager to head and run the business there." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he welcomed foreign competition in the world market, particularly 
from the Japanese. He disputed the idea that the United States is suffering 
from a huge trade deficit, saying government figures don't give a true picture 
of international commerce. He said many U.S. multinational companies 
manufacture their products overseas but U.S. government statistics count the 
products they ship from foreign countries as products of that country. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's view of Japanese competition, however, did not sit well with some 
other executives who attended the Friday meeting. Local computer executive 
Albert Wong said he views Japan as a formidable competitor in the 1990s and 
believes that the next generation of Japanese entrepreneurs and business people 
will more aggressively attack foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese companies should be seen like an army going to battle," said Wong, 
president of AMKLY Systems Inc. of Irvine. "When I went to Osaka recently, 
Japanese executives said they're worried about the next generation of Japanese 
executives. They are more arrogant and impatient."

Cosmo Securities, a Japanese securities broker, has sold its entire 9.7% stake, 
or 600,000 common shares, in American Health Services Corp., according to a 
federal filing. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Underwood, chief financial officer for American Health Services, said 
Cosmo acquired the stock from another individual who offered it to the company 
as collateral on a loan. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was unaware of any internal development at American Health that 
would have prompted the sale. The firm owns medical laboratories and outpatient 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmo sold the shares Sept. 6 for an undisclosed sum, according to a Securities 
and Exchange Commission filing. American Health stock recently has been trading 
at just under $1.50 per share. 
</P>
<P>
In early August, S. Lewis Meyer resigned as president and chief executive of 
the company. The company named E. Larry Atkins, executive vice-president and 
chief operating officer, to replace Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
American Health Services reported earnings of $325,508 for its first quarter 
ended March 31, up from $106,666 for the corresponding period in 1989. Revenues 
rose 30% to $7.4 million from $5.7 million.

JAPANESE LOOK TO EUROPE, STEP UP REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IN LONDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After gobbling up Hawaiian golf courses and Manhattan office towers, the 
Japanese now have a craving for something European. 
</P>
<P>
The investment opportunities are plentiful with European trade barriers 
dissolving in 1992 and potential new markets opening up with the death of 
communism in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese already have been stepping up their investments in Europe, with 
development and construction groups, investment firms and life insurance 
companies leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
In European real estate alone, Japanese investments totaled $5.5 billion last 
year, up from $3.1 billion in 1988, according to the Clark Whitehill accounting 
firm in London. For all the years up to 1985, the total investment was only 
$425 million, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are particularly keen on London, where investments topped $3 
billion during 1989, the firm said. That compared with $2.8 billion spent in 
New York and $2.6 billion in Los Angeles last year, according to data from 
Clark Whitehill and the Kenneth Leventhal accounting firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Barcelona also had heavy levels of Japanese 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Has the United States lost its allure to the Japanese? No way, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the older players are now looking at Europe," said Daniel Schwartz, 
managing director of the New York-based Ulmer Brothers investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
"But they're being replaced by newer investors who are looking at the United 
States for the first time."

THE FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
SMART-TECH HOMES ON WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLARK SHARON, Clark Sharon is a regular contributor to Home Design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Home of the Future was, sadly, to become the Home of the Past on a pleasant 
spring day in 1967 when a wrecking crew prepared to level one of Disneyland's 
landmark exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The Monsanto Chemical Co.'s vision of the future, an all-plastic residential 
showcase filled with high-tech gadgetry, was about to pass into history to make 
way for a new and improved Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
As a small group of park employees looked on, a massive iron wrecking ball 
began its assault on one of the home's four floating wings. What happened next 
can only be described as a testament to the durability of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
"That wrecking ball just sort of bounced off the house like a giant rubber 
ball," recalled witness Ray Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
Van France, founder of Disneyland's employee training program and recipient of 
a rare park honor -- a commemorative window on Main Street -- said the Home of 
the Future put up a stubborn fight. "I was amazed that a bulldozer could knock 
down a regular house in a couple of hours, while this seemed to take days." 
</P>
<P>
It did take about six days, according to Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thought it would be a quick job," said the former Disneyland 
maintenance supervisor. "Maybe a day or so at most. But it took much longer 
than anticipated. That Fiberglas was a tough bugger to break." 
</P>
<P>
But persistence and brute force finally prevailed. The gleaming white shell was 
smashed and the last plastic shards of Fiberglas, Lustrex and Ultron trucked 
away. 
</P>
<P>
But the memory of the future lingered. 
</P>
<P>
It was a future of hits, near misses and the occasional wild shot, much like 
the radical shape of the home itself. While the traditional home was basically 
a wood-framed box set in the ground, this floating cross of suspended plastic 
seemed to hover, seemingly ready to fly off into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
When the Home of the Future opened in June, 1957, it was presented as "the 
forerunner of the dwelling of the typical American family of four 10 years from 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, at the end of those 10 years, the Home of the Future itself was a pile 
of rubble. And, to this day, houses are still built as wood-framed boxes set in 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
But the plastic furnishings of the home, the plastic chairs and countertops, 
together with the acrylic carpets and upholstery, foretold a future that has 
evolved with a vengeance. In the 1950s, plastics were the wonder materials of 
in-home living. Today they are a fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
Other predictions advanced by Monsanto's team of futurists were to find their 
way into the American home: Microwave cooking, telephones with pre-set and 
push-button dialing, speaker phones and central climate control. 
</P>
<P>
The home had a built-in entertainment center complete with stereo, tape 
recorder and something called an "observascope," actually a giant color 
television that doubled as a movie screen (a forerunner of the age of video). 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the misses: stoves and appliances that disappeared into 
kitchen walls and countertops at a push of a button, atomic food preservation 
(whatever that was), ultrasonic dish-washing and a picture telephone. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1950s, Monsanto's plastic home was a bold new world, albeit one with 
synthetic underpinnings. It was also a practical advertisement for the chemical 
company's products. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the 18 million or so people who toured its plastic and electronic 
wonders during its Disneyland run, it became something of an old friend. Which 
is a lousy thing for a Home of the Future to become. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of us who hated to see it go," Schwartz said. "It was all 
fancied up for the future. It's just that the future, in a lot of ways, had 
caught up to it." 
</P>
<P>
Which is what the future does, and why predicting the future home will always 
be a growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble with our times is that the future is not what it used to be." -- 
Paul Valery, French poet 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is not. Certainly not in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Futurists once routinely predicted that homes would one day float in the air, 
or perhaps nestle underground, where they would serve as fully automated, 
high-tech human habitats. 
</P>
<P>
It was simpler to predict the future home in simpler times. All the dreamy 
in-home wizardry was just a technological stone's throw from the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The future home was going to be full of gadgets and was going to adapt itself 
into new and stunning shapes. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Benford, an award-winning science-fiction writer who lives in Laguna 
Beach and is a professor of physics at UC Irvine, visited the Disneyland 
dwelling in 1963. "It was interesting, but I didn't think then that houses (of 
the future) would look like French Impressionist paintings, and I still don't." 
</P>
<P>
Benford predicts that the home of the future 20 or 30 years from now will still 
look like today's tract dwellings. "But they'll be smarter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Benford foresees it, an aging population will mean an in-home future built 
on rollers and open spaces. "That way furniture and appliances can be moved 
more easily as people grow older." 
</P>
<P>
Beds will be adjustable, like those in a hospital, to meet the physical needs 
of the occupant. Also expected are light-colored or white roofs that will 
reflect sunlight and lower cooling costs, and banks of on-site residential 
solar cells for generating electricity from sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Benford admits that his practical future lacks the zing of past predictions 
that foretold of levitating lawn mowers and atomic garbage disposals. "The 
approach is more smart-tech rather than high-tech," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"We can build houses full of gizmos, but when the gadgetry begins to fail, 
that's when the real costs of a high-tech future begin to come around," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One item not to be found in the future home, according to Benford, is "a 
helipad on the roof." Futurists used to predict that people would someday 
commute to work in their own personal helicopters. "Anyone who knows how 
difficult it is to fly a helicopter would recognize this sort of thinking as a 
ticket to enormous disaster," Benford said. 
</P>
<P>
And still, like the call of the wild, the echo of a more exotic future home 
tugs at Benford's powers of prophesy. 
</P>
<P>
He confesses that he once wrote an article for Smithsonian Magazine that 
predicted the completely computerized and automated house. "You'd be able to 
dial your home's central computer before you left work and command it to open a 
window or turn on the heat, start your casserole cooking and let the cat out of 
the cat door." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, both homeowner and family cat have yet to see the advent of the fully 
automated house. Benford, though, remains good-naturedly stubborn about his 
future-gazing. 
</P>
<P>
"I predicted (the computerized home) in 1969, and I'm still predicting it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Behnam Bavarian, a futurist and colleague of Benford's at UC Irvine, agrees 
with Benford's assessment that the home of the future will look a lot like the 
home of today, with one major departure. The assistant professor of electrical 
and computer engineering warns that depletion of the earth's ozone layer could 
have a major impact on future dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be very bad if we have a disaster with the ozone layer," he said. "If 
that happens, we may have to live in houses or apartments that are shielded 
from ultraviolet radiation" that is now largely filtered by the ozone cover. 
</P>
<P>
Computerized window shutters would close automatically to shut out ultraviolet 
rays during peak periods. Or, on a more drastic scale, huge shelterlike 
apartment complexes would be built to shield large groups of residents. The 
home of tomorrow could become the fortress of the future. 
</P>
<P>
So-called "smart" homes that protect us from pollution and each other, that 
conserve energy and help control waste, may be forced upon us by the realities 
of 21st-Century living, Bavarian says. 
</P>
<P>
Computers and sensors would be the sentries on guard against a potentially 
hostile environment. 
</P>
<P>
Scratch a futurist, however, and you will likely find an optimist lurking 
beneath the surface. Bavarian believes that, barring any environmental disaster 
such as an ozone wipeout, these are all problems that "can be handled very well 
through applied technology." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bavarian never visited the Monsanto house at Disneyland, he predicts 
that at least one of the home's innovations -- ultrasonic dish-washing -- will 
be common within the next 10 years, as will clothes washers and dryers that 
work by ultra-sound. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big deal to design ultra-sound devices that will vibrate clothes to 
get the dirt out," he said. "Or machines that will clean dishes. Ultrasound is 
a very safe technology." 
</P>
<P>
Bavarian says that society will be pushed to use ultrasound to save precious 
water resources and to cut down on chemical pollution due to the use of 
detergents. 
</P>
<P>
Like Benford, however, he doubts that many homes in the coming decade will have 
picture phones. "Picture phones need fiber optics to transmit large amounts of 
information," he explained. "Not just in commercial networks, but in the home 
itself. Every home will need its own fiber optic system installed. It will cost 
a lot of money to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Bavarian says, "probably most people will not want to have to look at 
everybody who is calling them, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
For those who fear that the future is going to be starved for gadgets, Bavarian 
suggests that there is a lot more to the home of tomorrow than picture phones. 
Within the next 10 years, he predicts, we may be cooking with lasers, playing 
tennis with our television sets, and carrying on limited conversations with our 
household appliances. 
</P>
<P>
None of that is as far-fetched as it seems, he says. "'We could combine a laser 
with a microwave oven, for example. The laser would make food crispy on the 
outside while the microwave cooked it from the inside." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, trading tennis volleys with the telly would be a matter of 
using on-screen simulation, sensors and actual physical movement to "play" a 
computer-driven match. 
</P>
<P>
And conversing with appliances can be accomplished through the use of sensors 
and speech processors embedded throughout the house, Bavarian says. "You can 
talk with the microwave or dishwasher and tell them what you want them to do. 
They will take a verbal command and convert it to action." 
</P>
<P>
He admits that such technology is not cost-effective now, but "it can be in 10 
years." 
</P>
<P>
He also points out that such voice-activated devices could be tuned 
specifically to you so that no one else could use them. 
</P>
<P>
Bavarian carries the concept of talking appliances a step further. Actually, it 
was more like one small step for a futurist, one giant leap for robotics. 
</P>
<P>
For Bavarian foresees the day in the next 25 years when "intelligent" robots 
will perform most chores around the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Robots have been predicted for the home for a long time," he said. "But there 
has been great difficulty getting them to perform flexible, multipurpose 
tasks." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why Bavarian, whose research interests lie in this area, believes that 
some form of artificial intelligence, coupled with advanced sensors and new 
dynamics of robotic movement, must first be developed before robots can take 
their rightful place in the average home of 2015. 
</P>
<P>
He predicts that computers based on artificial neural networks that mimic those 
found in the human brain will allow these future generation robots to make 
decisions based on their memory of past experiences. In other words, they will 
be able to learn through trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
"A robot may make the same mistake two or three or four times, but eventually 
it will learn the correct way of doing something," he said. "The point is, the 
robot will learn on its own. It will automatically improve itself every day. It 
will be capable of some sort of reasoning." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to all this self-improvement, the robot will keep a close eye on 
its owner's wants and needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The robot will learn your behavior, your characteristics," he said. "It'll 
have sensor technology that will duplicate vision and speech. It will be able 
to look at your face and recognize that it's you." 
</P>
<P>
The robot of the future will be sort of a movable, benevolent Big Brother, 
according to Bavarian. "It just watches you. It accommodates you. The things 
that you like to do it provides for you." 
</P>
<P>
Still, couldn't such a smart robot educate itself enough that it might start to 
get ideas of its own? Could the electronic tin man of the future suddenly find 
one day that he has a heart? And a desire for a life of his own? Or, at least, 
Sundays off? 
</P>
<P>
Bavarian shook his head. "The bottom line is that (robots) are machines," he 
explained. "I don't think that would be possible." 
</P>
<P>
But a seed of doubt had been sown. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he said, after a pause. "Who knows what the future holds?"

ADJUSTABLES: YOU NEEDN'T TAKE REST LYING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you're in the hospital, you have to take your fun where you can find it. 
Filling the urine sample beaker with Heineken is always sure-fire, but you can 
only get away with it once before someone catches on. Daytime TV gets old after 
approximately 3.5 minutes, and hearing about your roommate's hernia will lose 
you in less than half that time. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the electric bed, which, fortunately, is great fun. It gives you an 
opportunity not only to control your own environment -- all but unknown in a 
hospital -- but to act shamelessly self-indulgent. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the days when they used leeches to treat a hangover, the only way you 
could get propped up in a hospital bed was to scream for burly nurses, who 
would muscle you around and shove pillows under you. But with an electric 
adjustable bed, you can wallow in the cushiest couch potato behavior just by 
manipulating a few buttons. 
</P>
<P>
This sort of thing translates well into a society crazed for electronics of any 
kind, particularly electronics that encourage sloth. And what better way to be 
happily indolent than sacking out in a bed that will do all your moving for 
you? 
</P>
<P>
The whole idea of an electric adjustable bed, of course, is to help you get 
comfortable, and they do a pretty good job of it. This is important to many 
people who have arthritis, back problems or other ailments not relieved by 
sleeping on a conventional bed. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, said Beverly Dove, a sales representative for Electropedic Products, 
this means people who are in their late 50s or older, but she added that buyers 
are not limited to that age group. She said she sold beds to three sisters, all 
in their 30s, who came to her Garden Grove showroom at the same time and bought 
the beds on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to consider them luxury items," Dove said. "Not all the people who buy 
them have health problems. A lot of them just want an adjustable bed." 
</P>
<P>
Being adjustable generally means that the bed raises at the head and at the 
foot, elevating a person's legs or upper body or both. There are several 
reasons why this may be desirable, but the overriding one is that by moving the 
body into different positions, one shifts pressure onto different parts of the 
body while taking pressure off of others. 
</P>
<P>
Elevating the legs with a bend at the knees, for instance, is supposed to 
relieve pressure on the lower back and ease pain in that area. It is also 
supposed to aid circulation. Hiatal hernia sufferers are said to feel better 
when they elevate both the back and the legs. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be in pain, of course. Cranking up the back of the bed is 
great for reading and watching TV, and it makes breakfast in bed a lot simpler 
to get down. 
</P>
<P>
(There are, incidentally, limits to the movement of the bed. You can't crank 
the head and the foot up simultaneously to full vertical and fold yourself in 
half. That happens to Inspector Clouseau, not to you.) 
</P>
<P>
The bed itself is not radically different from a conventional bed. The springs 
in the mattress must be individually hinged, however, in order to allow the 
mattress to conform to every shape the motor can manipulate it into. Several 
degrees of firmness are available. (A second product line sold in Dove's 
showroom, made by a company called Sleeper Lounge, uses a latex foam mattress.) 
</P>
<P>
The lift mechanism consists of an electric motor that powers either a system of 
pulleys or worm gears that raise and lowers the sections of the bed. There is a 
stopper at the foot of the bed to keep the mattress from shifting when the head 
of the bed is raised. 
</P>
<P>
There is another mechanism with some models that will be familiar to anyone who 
ever fed quarters into a box in a motel room that read "Magic Fingers." 
Electric massage units are available that, at their most basic, vibrate the 
mattress beneath you. 
</P>
<P>
The people at Niagara Adjustable Beds call their unit Tranquilssage. A sales 
representative for the company said the massage featured "three-way action" but 
declined to provide the price of any of the company's beds, saying, in effect, 
that you have to see them for the price to make sense. 
</P>
<P>
Dove said, however, that Niagara beds tend to be more expensive that the 
Electropedic line, which starts at about $400 for a twin and goes up to more 
than $1,800 for a dual king. The dual king is simply two twins placed side by 
side, each with individual controls, allowing two occupants to fold themselves 
around separately from their bedmate. (There is also a dual queen size.) 
</P>
<P>
If you've been wanting one of these things for a while, and you've got the 
money, succumb. If you've always liked things mechanical, you'll probably have 
a ball winding the thing up and down, and the massage unit may even bring back 
delightful memories of an otherwise-uninspired motel on Route 66 near 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the only other way to get a chance to fool around with an adjustable 
bed is to land in the hospital. Believe me, buying your own is cheaper.

AUTUMN IS AN EXCELLENT SEASON FOR PLANTING SHRUBS, TREES OR BULBS

Summer is winding down, but that's no signal to neglect your yard and garden. 
Autumn is an excellent time to plant many kinds of shrubs, trees and 
spring-blooming bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Fall plantings will add beauty and value to your home grounds. The plantings 
will develop roots during the winter, getting them off to a strong start next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
As you plan your landscaping, think of the benefits: sight-screening, comfort, 
beauty, convenience, safety and easy maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. of Nurserymen says that most homeowners want their yards to 
afford some privacy. A hedge of trees and shrubs can screen out unsightly views 
while affording some privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Your yard can provide outdoor room for comfort and relaxation. The temperature 
in a tree's shade, for instance, may be 15 to 20 degrees cooler than in the 
sun. A row of trees and shrubs can protect against disturbing winds. Thick 
foliage can muffle city noise and help cleanse a polluted atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance can be a pleasure rather than a burden. Flat borders of brick or 
stone between flower beds and lawn can minimize edging and trimming around 
beds. Planting in containers can ease gardening chores by eliminating the need 
for stooping. Some lawn mowing, watering and weeding work can be reduced by the 
use of mulches and ground-cover plants. 
</P>
<P>
The association also advises: "Once your plan has been made for your yard, 
don't feel installation can be done immediately. If the design is sufficiently 
flexible, it can take shape over months or even years, as circumstances 
dictate, whether you do it yourself or have professionals do it."

MAKING THE HOME -- AND WORLD -- MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE DISABLED 
</P>

Access is an ongoing challenge for the disabled, according to Jim Wickersham, 
who has been an occupational therapist at Casa Colina Hospital for 
Rehabilitative Medicine in Pomona for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They have many forms of access problems," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The most basic has to do with space, how to enter and get around in their 
living quarters. But people need access to the world as well -- no one wants to 
be housebound." 
</P>
<P>
Wickersham uses the telephone as one example. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone company offers 'manual' service to the handicapped free of charge. 
For people who can't dial or press buttons, telephone companies provide 
equipment that connects them directly with an operator who handles the call for 
them. It works with a speaker phone." 
</P>
<P>
Other access-related devices are available too, from private elevators to 
electronically controlled carousels (similar to those in dry-cleaning stores) 
that "bring" clothes to a person. 
</P>
<P>
"But unless you're wealthy or have incredible insurance benefits, these things 
are just not within the range of most people," Wickersham notes. 
</P>
<P>
"What occupational therapists try to do is find practical solutions for our 
clients. Since every case is unique, it takes a team effort: the client, the 
family, the physical therapist, the social worker. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, the best solution is what fits the situation." BETH COBB
