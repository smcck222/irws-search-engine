NAVY WEIGHS ACTION AGAINST SHIPYARD CITED FOR FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Navy officials said Friday they are considering whether to take action 
against one of the largest remaining private shipyard companies on the West 
Coast after a federal judge's ruling last month that the firm committed mail 
fraud and acted with fraudulent intent on a Navy contract. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine, with yards in San Diego, San Pedro and San Francisco geared 
toward the repair of large ships, acted "with intent to deceive, manipulate and 
defraud" the Small Business Administration and the Navy in the fall of 1983 to 
win a contract worth up to $150 million, U. S. District Judge Stanley A. Weigel 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The summary judgment was issued Aug. 8 as a precursor to a trial slated to 
start Wednesday before Weigel in San Francisco. At the trial, a jury will 
decide on a lawsuit brought by three shipyards against Southwest Marine, 
accusing it of using unfair tactics to win a five-year contract to perform 
maintenance on four Navy replenishment ships. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine gets about 80% of its business from the Navy and just last 
week received a $35-million contract to overhaul a cruiser, said Arthur E. 
Engel, president of the San Diego-based company. 
</P>
<P>
Contractors found in civil cases to have defrauded the Navy can be barred from 
bidding on Navy jobs, usually for three years, said Gerry Depkin, legal counsel 
for the Navy's Debarment Committee, which imposes the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the Debarment Committee makes its decision on whether to shut out 
bidders after receiving recommendations from other branches of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
One of those, the Naval Sea Systems Command, the agency within the Navy 
responsible for ship repair, is aware of the judge's ruling and is studying the 
matter, said spokeswoman Sue Fili. "We have not determined what action to 
take," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Depkin said, however, that, "We've become aware of this now, so it's possible 
that the Debarment Committee itself might look at this." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Southwest Marine, M. Laurence Popofsky, said that "all the 
facts have been known by the Navy for years" and that the company tried to 
follow the letter of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Only firms with 1,000 employees or less were allowed to bid on the Navy's 
five-year contract to qualify as small businesses, as defined by the Small 
Business Administration. Southwest Marine, following an obsolete rule that had 
accidentally been republished along with the SBA's new rules, tried to show 
that its work force was below 1,000 during certain weeklong reporting periods. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at the end of 1982, Southwest fired 513 employees at its shipyards 
in an attempt to maintain its status as a small business and then rehired them 
-- along with 46 others -- a week later, Weigel found. He said the firm also 
made false statements on an SBA form designed to ensure that it met the 
employee requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence now clearly establishes that (Southwest Marine) manipulated the 
quarterly method of counting employees between February, 1982, and December, 
1983, by periodically firing and rehiring employees for the purpose of 
retaining their small business status," the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Those acts constituted mail fraud, because the mails were used to convey the 
information, and intent to defraud under California law, Weigel said. 
</P>
<P>
Engel said Southwest Marine has 1,200 employees in its San Diego yard and 500 
to 600 employees at both its San Pedro and San Francisco yards.

BARGAIN HUNTERS NEVER FORGET A WHITE ELEPHANT 
</P>

Alfonso de Bourbon was poring over kitchen knickknacks. He cradled spatulas and 
knives, ladles and goblets, fingering each one carefully to see if it fit in 
his La Jolla "chateau." He entertained the Women of St. James with a litany of 
stories, mostly having to do with a wondrous genealogy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a count," one woman murmured. "A real count." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, but I never use my title," De Bourbon said, backing up a step. "If I claim 
it, it sounds like bragging. But they say I am the spitting image of King 
Alfonso XIII of Spain, the grandfather of the current King of Spain, Juan 
Carlos." 
</P>
<P>
De Bourbon came to La Jolla from Spain 14 years ago, intending only a visit. 
</P>
<P>
His fingers raced through his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"I seem to have misplaced my return airline ticket," he said Friday, one of 
hundreds of shoppers and sightseers -- and characters -- who came to mingle at 
the 57th annual White Elephant Sale put on by the Women of St. James. 
</P>
<P>
The Women of St. James is an auxiliary and charity run under the auspices of 
St. James by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. The lawn of the church, at the corner of 
Eads Avenue and Silverado Street in La Jolla, was littered with teddy bears, 
pots and pans, mopeds, good art, awful art, Ping-Pong tables, an exercise 
treadmill, an IBM personal computer and a 1966 Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Mounts, an organizer of this year's effort, said the sale raises about 
$30,000 a year. Recipients of the money are church-appointed charities that 
help take care of the needy and the homeless. Mounts said the 1987 event was 
the biggest ever, netting more than $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
The rummaging continues today from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, Mounts said, the sale pulls in the rich and the poor, the young and 
the old and a handful of curiosity seekers from south of the border. She said 
the Women of St. James are "quite proud" of the event and even a tad 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Cassidy, 75, now involved in her 50th sale, was telling Adele Webster, 67, 
that the Junior League sale is "the biggest in the county," with the Women of 
St. James a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
"But, Jane," Webster said with a hurt expression, "they have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The most-talked-about item Friday was the black '66 Cadillac, that someone said 
didn't run. Somebody else said the windows wouldn't roll down. Somebody else 
said it had to be towed over. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pat Carlton said the car was donated by a 
</P>
<P>
wealthy La Jolla woman who didn't need it any longer and who likes Carlton's 
homemade biscuits, which, in Carlton's words, persuaded the woman to "put it 
up." Carlton declined to name a price for the car; it's being auctioned through 
sealed bids. 
</P>
<P>
Kasey Crandall, who manages Croce's restaurant in the Gaslamp Quarter, said she 
likes the sale because outlet stores run by Goodwill Industries and the 
Salvation Army have become too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a set clientele, and they can charge more now," Crandall said. "See 
that orange dress over there? At Goodwill, I'd figure it for $7. Here I get it 
for $1.50." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Giacomazza, a gardener and part-time fireman from Del Mar, said he came 
to the sale "just to wander" and ended up finding a record album for 50 cents 
that brought back a flood of memories. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Future Games' by Fleetwood Mac," he said. "I haven't heard that one for 
years. Incredible. Just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picked Over Pretty Well 
</P>
<P>
Lance Pelky, a student at the University of San Diego, likes the sale as a 
collector of antique toys. He said he owns "upwards of $5,000" in toys and 
usually adds to the bounty by coming to the sale. 
</P>
<P>
No such luck this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I got here too late," he said. "Everything had been picked over pretty 
well. The sale's gotten so popular, people show up earlier and earlier every 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Taylor, who grew up in La Jolla, said La Jollans will surrender items 
for charity that "no one else will." She said the clothes, in particular, are a 
cut above the average when it comes to threads -- at least the kind found at 
most rummage sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I get Calvin Klein jeans here for next to nothing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Arnold, who comes to the sale for books and ornate, homemade Christmas 
decorations, said the event has been a fixture in La Jolla for decades "and 
gets more popular with each passing year." 
</P>
<P>
It's gotten so big that elderly Arnie Sieg has been hired for protection. Sieg 
sat near a side door, wearing a red visor with big white letters reading, 
"SECURITY." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough job," Sieg said with Barney Fife hubris, "but somebody's got to 
do it. You wouldn't want some guy walkin' off with a fork, would you?"

PLAN FOR BAYFRONT ESPLANADE OKD BY AD HOC GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ad hoc group of local and Navy officials agreed Friday on a conceptual plan 
governing construction along San Diego's downtown bayfront that calls for 
low-intensity development along the bay, several open-space sites and a 
continuous pedestrian esplanade along the entire shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway Complex Coordinating Group agreed to protect views of the bay by 
regulating the bulk of proposed bayfront developments to encourage construction 
of slender towers instead of wide, low-scale buildings. The height and size of 
buildings would increase further inland, with the greatest amount of 
development occurring along the Broadway corridor. Surface parking would be 
discouraged in favor of underground parking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Exciting Planning Potential' 
</P>
<P>
"The bayfront in Centre City San Diego offers opportunities that few, if any, 
cities can match," the report said. "An exciting planning potential exists 
because the future of a substantial portion of the bayfront will be determined 
by current efforts." 
</P>
<P>
But the report also cautioned that the development "will require unparalleled 
cooperation and coordination" among government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by representatives of 15 organizations with interests in 
the development of downtown, including the Navy, the San Diego City Council, 
the San Diego Unified Port Commission, the county Board of Supervisors, the 
Chamber of Commerce and the Centre City Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The plan now will be reviewed by the city's Centre City Planning Committee, 
which is developing a master plan for all of downtown. It needs ultimate 
approval by the City Council and the Port Commission, which owns much of the 
coastal land involved. 
</P>
<P>
The area covered by the agreement -- from Laurel Street on the north to 8th 
Ave. on the south, and inland to Harbor Drive -- includes the massive Broadway 
complex of hotels and office towers proposed by the Navy and an about 10-acre 
"Paseo Park" at the foot of Broadway. The exact dimensions of projects proposed 
for the various parcels in the plan are not part of the conceptual plan 
approved Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Another open space is envisioned as part of the redevelopment of the Solar 
Turbines site. Space at the County Administration Building, the G Street Mole 
and south of the Convention Center also would be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Also preserved through specifically prescribed height limits would be views 
from the water of the County Administration Building tower. 
</P>
<P>
Broadway, dubbed by the plan as "the ceremonial street in downtown," would be 
designed and landscaped to link the bayfront with the proposed new Civic Center 
on downtown's eastern edge, and Balboa Park via Park Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Drive would be narrowed to one lane of traffic south of Grape Street and 
developed as a pedestrian esplanade connecting open space and plazas. Pacific 
Highway, in contrast, would become the major bayfront thoroughfare for 
vehicles.

As she had threatened, Lawndale City Councilwoman Carol Norman blew the whistle 
on her colleagues again. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to signal her desire to speak because of a malfunctioning electronic 
light, the soft-spoken lawmaker pulled out a whistle and gave off two blasts 
during the Thursday night meeting, which was broadcast on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"Here comes the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus again," growled Councilman Larry 
Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
A former member of the city Planning Commission suggested that the notorious 
whistle be seized. 
</P>
<P>
Norman explained later: "There were some significant issues discussed and it 
(the power failure) made me less effective." 
</P>
<P>
After the councilwoman's second toot, Mayor Sarann Kruse dispensed with the 
usual system in which members push a button that activates a light at the 
mayor's desk. Instead, Kruse simply went around the table to call on each 
member to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who often finds herself in the minority on the council, also utilized 
the whistle at the previous session because her button -- and only her button 
-- was malfunctioning. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Jim Arnold said the system had been repaired but "then it went 
belly-up again." He added: "It was nothing intentional." 
</P>
<P>
"Next time," Norman said, "I may show up wearing a hard hat with a flashing red 
light." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Her latest reincarnation: 
</P>
<P>
In the movie version of actress Carrie Fisher's memoir, "Postcards From the 
Edge," Fisher's real-life mother, Debbie Reynolds, is played by . . . 
</P>
<P>
Shirley MacLaine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When County Supervisor Ed Edelman proposed the permanent placement of a 
10-foot-tall, 40-foot-long sculpture in the county mall "to symbolize the 
international bonding . . . between Mexico and the United States," he 
encountered some critics on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a piece of art, huh?" Supervisor Pete Schabarum asked dubiously after 
he was shown photos of the two segments of "Volemos Juntos" ("Let Us Fly 
Together") by Victor Manuel Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
Added Supervisor Deane Dana: "Being an engineer, somebody has to look at this 
thing in detail and see whether it can fit in that area out there. Ten-by-forty 
feet is no small little statue." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that the size of a train?" asked Supervisor Mike Antonovich, referring 
to one of his favorite topics, predecessor Baxter Ward's ill-fated proposal for 
a local commuter train. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors voted to ask the county museums of Art and Natural History, as 
well as the county Internal Services Department, to review the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman would like the sculpture placed near a statue of Christopher Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you checked with the American-Italian Assn. yet?" Schabarum asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Since it's the end of the week, let's clear up a couple of matters: 
</P>
<P>
As anyone involved in the Banning High-Carson High football rivalry could tell 
you, Banning is located in Wilmington, not Carson, as was reported here the 
other day. Also, unless you have to make an extraordinary number of 
connections, Paris is about 5,500 miles from Los Angeles, not 8,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
After a typical business day in Raymond Chandler's "Farewell My Lovely," 
private eye Philip Marlowe says to himself: 
</P>
<P>
"You've been sapped down twice, had your throat choked and been beaten half 
silly on the jaw with a gun barrel. You've been shot full of hop and kept under 
it until you're as crazy as two waltzing mice. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the snooping profession apparently isn't quite so exciting in reality. 
</P>
<P>
Any wimp would be assured by the promotional material put out by the 
82-year-old Nick Harris Detective Academy in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike our TV counterparts, being a private eye is not a dangerous 
profession," the academy says in hit-and-miss grammar. 
</P>
<P>
The academy even brags that its "Prom Night was featured on the Pat Sajak 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
Prom night? Did the attending gumshoes leave their hardware with a gat-check 
girl?

LA MESA PAYS $75,000 TO SLAYING-CASE SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City of La Mesa has agreed to pay $75,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by an 
El Cajon man who claimed he was incorrectly identified as the key suspect in a 
killing three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Glazebrook, 48, said he lost his self-confidence, his job and the trust 
of many of his friends when police investigators trailed him, hounded him and 
tagged him as the most likely candidate to have slipped into June Marilyn 
George's home and stab her 78 times in the head, neck, chest and arms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not eloquent enough to express how I feel today," said Glazebrook, 
in describing his settlement against La Mesa. "But I do know what it feels like 
to be considered a murderer." 
</P>
<P>
Although the $75,000 settlement was announced Thursday, Glazebrook said it cost 
him $90,000 in attorney's fees and court costs to bring the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vindication Claimed 
</P>
<P>
And, despite the city's refusal to acknowledge that it did anything wrong, 
Glazebrook nonetheless believes he has been vindicated and that his name is no 
longer besmirched. In looking back, he said, his life came tumbling down the 
moment his name emerged as the leading suspect in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"People who knew me for so many years didn't want me around," he said. "I'm 
single, and women canceled dates when they find out about me. I ceased to go 
out and meet new friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my job. I've had people physically jump when they found out what was 
going on. A next-door neighbor was aware the police had me under surveillance, 
but he didn't tell his wife because she couldn't handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother had a heart attack as the result of this. And my favorite aunt was 
never told of all this for a long time, for fear that she would have difficulty 
with it, too." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the August, 1986, slaying, La Mesa police believed they had good 
cause to consider Glazebrook a suspect. He knew the victim and had been to her 
home. His ex-wife physically resembled her, and the slaying occurred at a time 
when Glazebrook was distraught -- just days after his ex-wife remarried and he 
reportedly was breaking up with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Glazebrook was working then for a knife manufacturing firm in El Cajon. He was 
in La Mesa on the day of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Charged 
</P>
<P>
Glazebrook was arrested so authorities could take his fingerprints, but he was 
never charged in the killing. Yet he and his attorney, Tom Adler, said La Mesa 
police probably still consider him a prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about that statement, La Mesa Police Lt. Allen Joslyn said Thursday: "I'm 
not at liberty to say anything about that." 
</P>
<P>
"It's still an active, open case," the lieutenant added. "We follow up on any 
leads that are available to us. We are always going over evidence, and we have 
an outstanding case." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney representing the City of La Mesa in the case did not return a 
phone call Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The George case is one of three unsolved slayings dating back to 1983 in La 
Mesa, a city that Joslyn said experiences "less than one homicide a year." 
</P>
<P>
After George was found slain in the kitchen of her Mariposa Street home, 
Glazebrook said, he attended her funeral in Los Angeles. He also contacted the 
police, offering his help in any way to catch the assailant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus of Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Unhappily, he said, the focus of the investigation turned on him. 
</P>
<P>
He said he attempted to cooperate. He said he submitted to a lie detector test, 
which he said he passed. He said he provided fingerprints and blood samples, 
photographs and a signed statement. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the police wanted a confession, and, when he didn't oblige, they 
began trailing him. He said police followed his car, watched his home and 
harassed his friends. Tired of the invasion of privacy, he took the matter to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Adler, his attorney, said that even though the $75,000 settlement does not 
represent a large monetary award, his client was not looking to get rich. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never really a big money issue with him," the lawyer said. "That wasn't 
what he was interested in. His interest was in clearing his name." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Glazebrook said, he feels vindicated. "I wanted to hold them 
accountable," he said. "I just lived for the day that I could go public with 
what happened to me."

Despite objections by some neighbors, the newly built Beverly Connection 
shopping center should be rezoned as entirely commercial, a Los Angeles zoning 
official has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling supports a proposal by City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky to rezone a 
part of the shopping center site that is now zoned for residential use, 
provided that restrictions are imposed on further development there. 
</P>
<P>
"This action will not bring about any more commercial floor space or uses other 
than those that are already there," said Dick Takase, the city planner who 
issued the ruling Thursday after holding a public hearing in August. "It merely 
recognizes the existing development." 
</P>
<P>
Some community leaders argued, however, that the neighborhood is already 
overburdened by development and severe traffic congestion, and some have 
accused Yaroslavsky of caving in to commercial interests. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sweetheart deal for the developer," said Laura Lake, a longtime 
activist in Westside development issues who unsuccessfully challenged 
Yaroslavsky in last April's election. "This city is job-rich and housing-poor. 
You don't give up residentially zoned property to make it commercial." 
</P>
<P>
The nearly completed Beverly Connection shopping center lies on 8.3 acres of 
land directly across La Cienega Boulevard from the Beverly Center shopping 
mall. The Beverly Connection has a supermarket, a music store and a sporting 
goods store. The developer also plans to build a six-screen, 2,100-seat movie 
complex and two restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute involves a 5 1/2-acre portion of the shopping center property that 
is zoned for residential use but has been used mostly as a parking lot under a 
43-year-old variance. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling, the entire parcel would be reclassified as commercial, and 
the development would be restricted to its existing size, about 291,000 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Lake and other critics spoke out against the plan at last month's public 
hearing, and Lake vowed to continue the fight when the issue goes before the 
Planning Commission and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Lake said an adjacent parcel, a 70,000-square-foot office and retail complex at 
3rd Street and La Cienega, is also covered by the zoning proposal, and that if 
this is added, the size of the development is really 360,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
If the property zoned as residential is not included, she argued, the developer 
would be restricted to 250,000 square feet by Proposition U, the slow-growth 
measure adopted by Los Angeles voters in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"What it amounts to is a windfall for the developer," Lake said. "And if the 
property is destroyed or leveled by an earthquake or fire, it would be like 
starting with a fresh slate -- nothing to force him to build residential 
units." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky was unavailable to comment on the ruling, but he has previously 
said that the purpose of his rezoning proposal was not to increase development 
but to limit it to what exists there today. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Katz, a spokesman for Beverly Connection developer Avi Lerner, said the 
restrictions do not give the owner the windfall that Lake and other critics 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
Katz also denounced as ridiculous the suggestion by Lake and others that 
Yaroslavsky gave Beverly Connection a sweetheart deal because Katz's wife, 
Alisa, is Yaroslavsky's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Harold R. Hahn, president of the Burton Way Homeowners Assn., said he was 
deeply disturbed by the zoning ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being across the street from the 900,000-square-foot Beverly 
Center, the Beverly Connection is less than a mile from two proposed 
developments of more than 1 million square feet each -- at the Farmers Market 
at 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue, and the May Co. site at Fairfax and Wilshire 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Takase said it would be useless to request an environmental impact 
report because most of the buildings are built. "That would be like requesting 
a building permit after the construction is completed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Takase said a proposal to restrict the size of stores was rejected after city 
traffic engineers found that smaller stores generate more traffic than larger 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
"A 50,000-square-foot store generates less traffic than five 10,000-square-foot 
stores," he said. "That kind of restriction would be self-defeating." 
</P>
<P>
Takase said his report recommended that half the space in the adjacent 
70,000-square-foot building at La Cienega and 3rd be reserved for office space. 
All buildings in the block bounded by La Cienega and Beverly boulevards, 3rd 
Street and Croft Avenue are limited to 45 feet in height.

COMMISSIONER ROXANI GILLESPIE AND PROPOSITION 103 ROLLBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial on Proposition 103 ("Next Step for Proposition 
103," Sept. 5) and granting the fact that editorial pages are repositories of 
opinion rather than fact, nonetheless, I believe your editorial writer erred in 
stating "Gillespie does not seem interested in making her former colleagues 
abide by the new law." 
</P>
<P>
As I understand it, Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie is abiding by the 
law. The California Supreme Court decided that the companies were entitled to a 
"fair and reasonable rate of return." The hearings being held are to determine 
whether companies are to be granted exemptions from rollbacks or not. I believe 
the hearings are entirely in keeping with due process. 
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to me as an insurance broker that the coverage in your 
editorial section is so heavily slanted with Harvey Rosenfield and Atty. Gen. 
John Van De Kamp. It was Will Rogers who said, "A liberal is man who is willing 
to spend somebody else's money." So, apparently, are the editors of The Times.

GUN CONTROL AND '22 COWARDLY ACTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here we go again! 
</P>
<P>
The editorial "22 Cowardly Acts" (Sept. 17) should have been headlined "22 
Courageous Acts." These 13 Republican, eight Democratic and one independent 
state senators were brave enough to vote against the ill-conceived (Sacramento 
Democrat Lloyd G.) Connelly bill. These people are apparently intelligent 
enough to ignore the current anti-gun hysteria and vote the way they know is 
right. Unlike the obviously emotionally charged gun haters, these people 
apparently know the facts and the facts are that more restrictive firearm laws 
do nothing to reduce violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
Let's stop pretending we're all blind! Look at New York City. Look at Detroit. 
Look at our nation's capital. Strict gun control laws have always failed 
miserably while violent crime has increased alarmingly. Criminals buy drugs on 
the street; criminals buy guns on the street. They always have and they always 
will as long as we allow them to roam our streets at will. 
</P>
<P>
People can (and I'm sure will) bash the National Rifle Assn. all they want. But 
the fact is the NRA will continue to protect our individual right to protect 
ourselves and our families in these increasingly violent times. We know the 
police can't always be there. We know violent criminals are being let out on 
the streets continuously. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't we stop arguing and join together to repair the problems at the 
source -- our failing justice system, our lack of mental health care, our drug 
abusers. The more time we waste arguing among ourselves the more innocent lives 
will be lost.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Again we have an attempt by Harvey Rosenfield ("Brazen Defiance of the People's 
Law," Op-Ed Page, Aug. 31) to justify his sponsoring of Proposition 103 and to 
blame someone else for its not working. He should just admit that Proposition 
103 was a misguided and an ill-conceived effort and that the only way we are 
going to get any relief from increasing insurance premiums is to cut down on 
lawyer fees and set limits on amounts that can be recovered under personal 
injury claims. Insurance company profits are not soaring. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, as shown on the graph accompanying his article, we see that 
the ratio of premiums to payouts has remained about the same. Extrapolating 
from the graph we see that in 1984 there was a 68% payout (approximately), in 
'85 and '86, a 62% payout, and in '87 and '88, a 63% payout. The amount for 
overhead and profit has remained constant. 
</P>
<P>
I must take umbrage with his final paragraph where he states that "public 
outrage over insurance company failure to obey Proposition 103 could cost them 
the privilege of doing business in California." First of all, the public is 
becoming outraged over being duped by Rosenfield, Ralph Nader, and their ilk, 
and second, when insurance firms can no longer make a reasonable profit in this 
state they will leave voluntarily and the consumer will be the poorer for it 
because of decreased competition and fewer choices.

In The Times editorial pages there was an article by Rosenfield and several 
letters from readers, all complaining about the way Roxani Gillespie has 
betrayed the intent of Proposition 103 (Aug. 31). I don't know about 
Rosenfield, but I believe it is likely that many of the persons who voted for 
103 and are now disappointed at how it is not being implemented had also voted 
for George Deukmejian for governor. Since Gillespie is Deukmejian's appointee, 
these persons are simply getting what they deserve.

JURY ACQUITS RANDALL TERRY, 4 FOLLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with relief that I read the verdict in the trial of Operation Rescue's 
Randall Terry and co-defendants (Part I, Sept. 14): relief that the jury was 
not swayed by the hypocrisy of public sentiment (of those who) condemn the 
courageous actions of those who would prevent the unjust killing of unborn 
babies; relief that the jury was also not swayed by Los Angeles Municipal Judge 
Richard Paez's apparent anti-Christian bias; relief that even those jurors who 
were pro-choice were able to set aside major philosophical differences in 
pursuit of justice. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors may be criticized for deciding emotionally, but is that really a 
valid criticism? It is hard, if not impossible, for caring and thinking people 
not to react emotionally when they are first confronted with the ugly truths of 
abortion. That certainly does not mean the jurors lost their ability to reason. 
I have to applaud all 12 of them in their decision on what was surely a 
difficult case.

GUN CONTROL AND '22 COWARDLY ACTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "Judgment Day on Firearms," I submit that its 
style should be criticized even more than its substance. 
</P>
<P>
Since I'm a gun owner and a life member of the NRA, it's obvious that your 
editorial staff is no more going to change my gun views than I'm going to 
change its gun views. However, what really galls me is your strong penchant for 
name-calling, such as "small band of zealots," "cowards," etc. In this 
connection, one thing I learned by taking debating in college is that if your 
opponent has no facts or logic at his or her command, he or she will invariably 
engage in histrionics, playing to the grandstand, complete fabrications, and 
name-calling, and lose the debate decisively. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with regard to the Second Amendment, how long -- oh, how long -- is it 
going to take your editorial staff to learn to read and understand the 
following crucial words: " . . . The right of the people to keep and bear arms, 
shall not be infringed!" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, The Times' editorial staff 
does not corner the market on common sense, as it insinuates.

Your editorial explains it all. The only time these so-called representatives 
would change their minds is if they could have witnessed the rampage of these 
gun-toting individuals, or if one of their loved ones would be affected. Do I 
hear the slogan "Guns don't kill, people do?" You couldn't kill seven, 10 or 15 
people with a knife or ax in two minutes, could you? LEO ANSCHEL

GUN CONTROL AND '22 COWARDLY ACTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I, a law-abiding gun owner, am personally offended by The Times' scurrilous 
characterization of me, and my fellow gun owners, as "a small band of zealots, 
who -- history and reason notwithstanding -- persist in a willfully distorted 
reading of the Second Amendment" (editorial, "Judgment Day on Firearms," Sept. 
13). I would genuinely entertain an explanation from your editorial writer of 
exactly how a simple, straightforward sentence (" . . . The right of the people 
to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed") can be distorted into anything 
other than what it says. I think our legislators are in need of remedial 
English because they apparently do not understand the clarity or meaning of the 
phrase, "shall not be infringed!" 
</P>
<P>
I have not forgotten the first part of the Second Amendment, the part which 
refers to "A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free 
State. . . ." Both Webster's and the American Heritage dictionaries define 
"militia" as an army composed of citizens who are not in the armed forces, and 
who can be made available in time of emergency, attack or crisis. Webster's 
further defines the armed forces reserves and the National Guard as the 
"organized militia" (regulated by the military's rules), and all others as the 
"unorganized militia" (regulated by civil laws and the guiding principles of 
the NRA). 
</P>
<P>
In 1903, Congress defined the militia as consisting of all able-bodied male 
citizens more than 18 and less than 45 years of age. Therefore, virtually every 
one who is a law-abiding citizen can claim the right to own a firearm, 
regardless of any "reason," "safety," or "public interest" canard that the 
gun-banning factions can present in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
If Assemblymen Connelly and Johan Klens (D-Castro Valley) truly mean to act in 
the public's interest, then let them enforce the laws that already exist to 
keep gun-wielding criminals locked up and off our streets (and schoolyards), 
because putting more restrictions on the rest of us has historically proven to 
cause no increase in safety at all.

GIFT TO COMMUTERS: SEPULVEDA TUNNEL REOPENS 8 DAYS EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sepulveda Tunnel has reopened to traffic eight days ahead of schedule but 
not a day too soon for traffic-weary motorists and residents along neighboring 
routes, which absorbed many of the 28,000 cars rerouted each day by the 
monthlong closure, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a godsend to have it opened again," said Los Angeles Police Officer 
Gary Wachtler, who handles traffic complaints for the department's Valley 
Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
The reopening Thursday afternoon did not immediately lighten traffic because 
most motorists thought that the tunnel was still closed, officials said. Chuck 
Ellis, spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Public Works, said work 
crews put in extra effort to open the tunnel early so that traffic could return 
to normal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real pleased with the fact that the contractors, instead of just taking 
the contract and saying, 'We got this much time,' realized there's a lot of 
cars and it impacts on everybody's drive to work," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily traveled tunnel was closed Aug. 19 for reconstruction of the 
roadway, which had risen so high because of past resurfacing that the tops of 
large trucks sometimes scraped the roof. Trucks often drove down the center of 
the roadway to avoid hitting the roof, creating a hazard for oncoming vehicles, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers also rebuilt the sidewalk and gutter along the west side of the tunnel, 
Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
The closure caused unusually long traffic delays in both directions of the San 
Diego Freeway, which runs parallel to Sepulveda Boulevard, and clogged 
alternative routes such as Beverly Glen Boulevard, Coldwater Canyon Avenue, 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Hayvenhurst Avenue and Woodcliff Road, Wachtler said. 
</P>
<P>
He said police received several dozen complaints from residents angry about 
added congestion and speeding on their streets. He estimated that while the 
tunnel was closed, 80,000 to 100,000 cars traveled those streets during 
afternoon rush hours, contrasted with 50,000 to 60,000 cars before the closure. 
</P>
<P>
"We issued 600 citations on those arteries just to get people to slow down," 
Wachtler said. "It's incredible how they can drive so fast and run so many stop 
signs." 
</P>
<P>
He said that under normal circumstances, officers patrolling those streets 
issue 80 to 100 tickets in the same period of time. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Sgt. Daniel Rodman said the tunnel closure added 20 
minutes to his daily commute on the San Diego Freeway from Culver City, where 
he lives, to the Woodland Hills office where he works. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot heavier all the way from Sunset Boulevard over the hill," Rodman 
said. "I was leaving at 6:30 a.m. Normally I left at 7." 
</P>
<P>
Motorists driving south on the San Diego Freeway said morning rush-hour traffic 
frequently was congested as far north as Nordhoff Street during the closure.

JUDGE RETURNS KILLER TO MENTAL HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who killed her mother and slashed her daughter's throat nine years ago 
was denied a bid Friday to return to a halfway house program similar to one 
from which she disappeared in March. 
</P>
<P>
Arlyne Louise Genger, 46, was ordered by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge James M. 
Coleman to return to Patton State Hospital, the state psychiatric facility from 
which she won her freedom in June, 1988, after a court determined that she had 
been rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
Genger had been living in Gateway Hospital, a residential community treatment 
program in Los Angeles. She disappeared from the facility in March after 
getting permission to go to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said she went to Las Vegas and lost most of her money gambling, 
then went to Orange County and found work as a telephone saleswoman. She was 
arrested last month as she went to pick up a paycheck after quitting her job. 
Genger was traced when she applied for a driver's license under her real name, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her disappearance, Genger had unsuccessfully petitioned the 
court several times to be released from the facility and to be allowed to live 
in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Genger was declared not guilty by reason of insanity after she admitted 
stabbing her mother more than 20 times and cutting her daughter's throat and 
wrist with a razor in the family's North Hollywood apartment on New Year's Day, 
1980. Genger's daughter, Selena, then 13, survived the attack. Her mother did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Goldberg, Gateway's program director, advocated Genger's return to 
Patton, saying Genger is hostile to authority figures and to anyone with whom 
she has a close relationship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Halfway House 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Public Defender Dennis G. Cohen, who represented Genger, asked that 
she be allowed to enter a different halfway house so that she could continue 
treatment with a different therapist. 
</P>
<P>
He said Genger proved by leaving the halfway house that she has been 
rehabilitated. "There is no indication that she involved herself in any 
violations of the law, committed any crimes or hurt any person," Cohen said. 
Instead, Genger proved that she was able to work and function in society. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. James A. Baker said Genger should absolutely not be 
allowed to remain in a halfway facility. 
</P>
<P>
Genger's cousin, Richard Cookston, said after the hearing that Genger's 
daughter and other family members would be relieved by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We as a family do not want to see her out. We want her in there forever," 
Cookston said. He said relatives are hiding from Genger and had feared that she 
might try to find them before her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he will petition the court in six months -- the minimum time 
required by state law -- to have Genger released from Patton.

GOVERNOR KILLS BILL TO INCREASE AUTHORITY OF COASTAL PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
DAVIS' MEASURE SOUGHT TO SLOW 'MIDNIGHT DEVELOPERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that disappointed environmentalists, Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday 
vetoed legislation that would have given the state Coastal Commission power to 
crack down faster on illegal road-building and other unpermitted development. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said in a veto message that he scuttled the bill, authored by 
state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), because the commission should not have sole 
authority to impose on builders immediate stop-work orders backed by fines. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' legislation sought to give coastal officials authority to issue 
cease-and-desist orders against developers who violate coastal preservation 
laws. The legislation also provided for fines up to $6,000 per day against 
builders who ignored such orders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backlog of Cases 
</P>
<P>
Coastal officials said the bill was needed to help combat rising incidents of 
illegal road construction, landscaping and stream filling in coastal regions. 
They said years of Deukmejian budget cuts have left the commission with a 
backlog of more than 600 cases of alleged violations statewide, more than half 
of them in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal road grading and landscaping have become serious problems in the Santa 
Monica Mountains and the Malibu area, where the enticement of huge profits to 
be made from building expensive homes far exceeds the threat of state fines as 
far as many developers are concerned, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Under Davis' bill, coastal officials would have been able to issue stop-work 
orders in a single day. Under existing law, they must ask the state attorney 
general's office to persuade a judge to sign a temporary restraining order, a 
process that often takes a week. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, officials say, "midnight developers" can finish a project, 
wreaking environmental damage that is often difficult to document, and 
expensive and time-consuming to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian agreed with business and farm interests that opposed the bill on 
grounds that it would give bureaucrats "blanket authority" to shut down 
projects, rather than leaving that decision to a judge in a court hearing where 
landowners could present their case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Objects to Power 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the goal of the author in his attempts to enforce the law against 
unauthorized development on the coast," Deukmejian said. "I do not believe, 
however, that either the executive director or the Coastal Commission should 
have sole authority to impose cease-and-desist orders which are accompanied by 
substantial fines." 
</P>
<P>
Coastal officials had expected the governor, a longtime antagonist of the 
coastal protection agency, to torpedo the Davis bill. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld of Malibu angrily criticized him 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so blinded by his hatred of the commission that he violated his own 
principles of law and order," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely on the side of law-breakers. We'll just have to continue in 
the vein we are and hope these criminals don't wreck the coastal zone before we 
have a new governor." 
</P>
<P>
Glickfeld said continued unauthorized grading and other development could, in 
mountainous areas, result in flooding that might cause serious property damage 
and even loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who left Friday on a trip to Portugal, could not be reached for comment. 
A spokesman described him as "deeply disappointed" by Deukmejian's veto, which 
marked only the second time that the Republican governor has rejected a Davis 
bill.

SAUGUS DISTRICT IN STANDOFF WITH TEACHERS OVER RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers and administrators negotiating a new contract in the Saugus Union 
Elementary School District resolved some of their differences Friday but 
remained at an impasse over the teachers' request for a 12% raise this year. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Chris Wilson said the two sides agreed on an improved fringe benefits 
package, but still will seek the help of an outside mediator to resolve the 
salary dispute. The two sides were at an impasse Thursday night after four days 
of fruitless negotiating sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Saugus Teachers Assn. hopes that funds from Proposition 98, a state school 
funding initiative passed last year, can be used to raise the salaries of the 
district's 218 teachers by 12% this year. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed increase would be in addition to a 6% raise that the teachers will 
get this year under the present contract, Wilson said. The teachers want a 12% 
raise next year as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators said they cannot approve the proposed raises because 
they are not sure how much money they will receive from the state under 
Proposition 98. The teachers association says the district is underestimating 
the funds available. 
</P>
<P>
Although the teachers and administrators remain divided, the district's 100 
non-teaching employees approved a separate three-year contract Thursday that 
will raise their salaries by 6% each year, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, teachers held a candlelight vigil outside district offices 
to press their demands for a raise. 
</P>
<P>
The district has 5,200 students.

WHAT'S INTEGRATION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the article "San Fernando Comes of Age" (Sept. 17) on the city in 
which I have been a lifelong resident. It is truly revealing to read of the 
phenomenon we have all experienced. 
</P>
<P>
One thing puzzles me. While you continually mentioned the advance of Latinos 
into the formerly isolated north end of town, you never mentioned how many 
Anglos have moved into the former barrio. It seems to me that an "integrated" 
community must be something like a two-way street. If no reverse action has 
taken place, "integration" is a misleading term. 
</P>
<P>
If, by the turn of the century, the Latino population of the north end will be 
90%, does that alone make for "integration"? Is the south end still also 90% 
Latino? Would it be "integrated" if they were both eventually 90% Anglo? I 
somehow doubt it.

DESIRE TO BUILD COMMUNITY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the articles by Tracey Kaplan regarding the trials and 
tribulations of us North Hollywoodians and our various neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Village ("Battle of the 'Stucco Mountains' Heats Up," Sept. 18) will 
continue to lose its country atmosphere just as our Toluca Woods area will have 
to contend with the body and fender shops and their attendant blight. All of 
North Hollywood will have to accept the fact that Lankershim Boulevard will 
become an urban nightmare as Flower Street in Los Angeles has become. 
</P>
<P>
But through the Los Angeles Times and reporters like Kaplan, we will know that 
there are among us a few brave souls who have not lost or given up a sense of 
belonging and a desire to build community life in this part of Los Angeles.

RAIDER MOTTO: HAVE BALL, WILL TRAVEL

<TEXT>
<P>
An article (Sept. 14) on the Raiders' possible move to Sacramento stated that a 
Sacramento audience booed suggestions that the city's money might be better 
spent on housing for the homeless, helping drug addicts and building libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Seems as though Sacramento citizens, like so many others in many U.S. cities, 
consider only financial gain and never the human aspects.

Why is it that women finalists in the U.S. Open play three sets to the men's

The Oakramento (or Sacland, if you wish) Raiders will play four games in 
Oakland and four home games in Sacramento with any playoff games to be played 
in Irwindale.

In addition, the Raiders will pack their bags every five years, move to a new

GO-KARTING STRUGGLES TO ESTABLISH RESPECTABILITY IN WORLD OF RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Vince Kowalick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most people, Go-Kart racing conjures up memories of a borrowed engine from 
the family lawn mower, a healthy, running push down the alley from your big 
brother, a traffic citation from the neighborhood motorcycle cop and an angry 
father upon his return home from work. 
</P>
<P>
 Aw, gee whiz, Dad! Grounded? For a whole month? 
</P>
<P>
 And that's probably why real Go-Kart racing has found it difficult to 
establish itself as a bona fide competitive endeavor for racing enthusiasts, 
according to Richard Taylor, director of public relations for the L. A. Kart 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Very unsophisticated and very small," Taylor said, describing most people's 
perception of Go-Karts. "The lawn mower's missing its motor and you're out in 
the street. Go-Karts have been around a long time. But these guys take it 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
One is Marc Nixon, 27, of Val Verde, who began Go-Karting 1 1/2 years ago. Yet, 
he, too, is battling adolescent stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's related to children," he said. "People think of 8-year-olds and Malibu 
Grand Prix and 'Haven't you grown up yet?' 
</P>
<P>
"But honestly, it's a very pure form of racing." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of racing with your backside just a few inches above the 
pavement. But this, your father might be surprised to learn, is real racing. 
Go-Karts, may be small, but they're fast, some reaching speeds of 80 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, the LAKC will make its regular monthly visit to Saugus Speedway. 
The 60-member club will navigate a makeshift road course on the one-third mile 
paved oval from 9 until noon. 
</P>
<P>
With two remaining dates on this season's schedule, Nixon trails points leader 
Larry Margules of Northridge by 50 points in the Econo Heavy division -- the 
second of the club's five divisions. Doug Polito, 24, of Calabasas, with two 
consecutive second-place finishes, is third with 980 points. 
</P>
<P>
Under the club's scoring system, 240 points are awarded to the winner of a 
24-kart main event. And with 10 points separating each subsequent finisher, the 
Econo Heavy division's points race is about as hot as a 100cc Go-Kart engine. 
</P>
<P>
"People kind of don't know what to think of karting because they've never seen 
it," Polito said. "But some drivers have learned everything from karting." Two 
familiar names in racing circles -- Michael Andretti and Al Unser Jr. -- trace 
their driving roots to Go-Karting, LAKC's Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus' regular Saturday night crowd has been treated to Go-Kart action in the 
past. Earlier this month, Taylor and the LAKC appeared for a well-received 
exhibition during intermission. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how many fans wind up walking to their cars talking about 
Go-Karts and not the stock car races," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Including stock car drivers. Alas, the image of the back-alley racer may never 
elude Go-Kart drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The drivers that aren't into Go-Karts are rude to you and they laugh at you," 
Nixon said. "You know how that goes. Go-Karts are just little and people think 
they are cute and funny." 
</P>
<P>
Add Go-Karts: Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of Go-Kart racing is the speed 
the tiny vehicles achieve. Karts with 250cc engines typically travel about 
75-80 m.p.h. -- a speed comparable to that of stock cars that race regularly at 
Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Go-Karts also have simplified engines and no shock absorbers. "They're very 
simplistic," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
The most attractive aspect, however, is the relative inexpensiveness of running 
a Go-Kart. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go to Saugus and watch the regular street races and I didn't know 
Go-Karting was available," said Taylor, 42, who began racing Go-Karts in 1986. 
"I was a racing enthusiast and this was the cheapest form around. 
</P>
<P>
Said Polito: "If I had the money, I'd go into quarter midgets or three-quarter 
midgets and work my way up to Indy cars. That's my goal. I'm learning." 
</P>
<P>
Fills the bill: Saturday night's program at Saugus will be a loaded one, thanks 
to last week's postponement because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday's schedule will be added to this week's bill, creating a program 
with a season-high six main events in the final points races of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Main events include: Sportsman division (40 laps), Street Stock oval (25 laps) 
and figure 8 (15 laps) Hobby Stock oval (25 laps) and figure 8 (15 laps). 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled is the Sportsman "Clash for Cash," in which 15 drivers will 
compete in an added 20-lap main event with an overall purse of $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Champions of the Sportsman, Street Stock and Hobby Stock divisions will be 
crowned during the evening. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sportsman class, Keith Spangler of Northridge (334), Will Harper of 
Tarzana (331) and Dave Phipps of Simi Valley (316) are atop the points 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
In the Street Stock division, Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley, (291), Dale White 
Jr. of Simi Valley, (290), Russ Beckers of Sepulveda (286) and Craig Rayburn of 
Simi Valley (286) all have a shot at the title.

Russ Spencer's goal 15 minutes into the second half broke a scoreless tie as 
The Master's College upset visiting UC San Diego, 1-0, in a nonconference 
soccer match Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The match pitted the third-ranked team (San Diego) in the NCAA against the 
16th-ranked Master's of the NAIA. And The Master's defense rose to the 
occasion, allowing UC San Diego (3-1-1) just three shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
One of those shots was a penalty kick that junior goalie Allan Bowden stopped. 
He also had a diving save during the match. 
</P>
<P>
"He played phenomenally," Master's Coach Mark Schubert said. "It's the best 
I've ever seen him." 
</P>
<P>
Master's is now 5-3-1.

BRAY FALLS TO ANOTHER EUROPEAN FIGHTER

<TEXT>
<P>
John Bray still has a world to conquer. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys resident is the top-ranked U.S. amateur heavyweight boxer but has 
yet to prove himself against Eastern European fighters, who along with the 
Cubans have traditionally dominated international amateur boxing. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's Axel Schulz decisioned Bray on Friday night, 20-5, in a 
first-round bout in the World Amateur Boxing Championships in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting under a new scoring system designed to reward aggressiveness and 
eliminate controversy from decisions, Bray was tentative during the three-round 
fight and did not throw enough punches. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel terrible," a tearful Bray said after losing to Schulz, a silver 
medalist in the European championships. "I should have done what my corner told 
me. I didn't listen and you saw the result." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in four months that Bray has looked unimpressive while 
fighting an Eastern European boxer. In June, he lost a unanimous decision to 
Viktor Akshonov of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Bray is expected to get another chance at the Eastern Europeans in November at 
the USA-USSR Heavyweight Invitational. STEVEN HERBERT

Redlands 35, Antelope Valley 13 -- Host Antelope Valley (1-2) struggled 
offensively for the second consecutive week. Antelope Valley's frustration 
began in the second quarter when it failed to score on two excellent 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Senior tailback Wayne Walters caught a screen pass, broke several tackles and 
ran 62 yards untouched down the sideline, only to fall at the Redlands 13. On 
the same possession, sophomore Peter Holt attempted a 46-yard field-goal 
attempt, but the ball hit the left goal post and bounced away. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley quarterback Tony Abrams passed for 161 yards, completing nine 
of 25 passes. Abrams, however, threw 12 consecutive incomplete passes. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands (3-0) led, 21-0, after three quarters. Running back Marcus Rogers 
caught an 18-yard touchdown pass and ran 10 yards for another score to give 
Redlands a 14-0 halftime lead. Chad Golob returned a punt 56 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Walters scored both Antelope Valley touchdowns in the fourth quarter on runs of 
11 and four yards. Walters finished with 15 yards rushing in 14 carries.

PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF FOR CASEY, SYLMAR

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Casey made several nice runs Friday night against Verdugo Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them even counted. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, billed as one of the nation's 10 best high school running backs by Super 
Prep magazine, scored three touchdowns and had two others nullified by 
penalties to lead Sylmar to a 28-7 victory over Verdugo Hills in a nonleague 
opener at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Casey finished with more receiving yardage than rushing yardage. 
The senior tailback gained 78 yards in 15 carries and scored on a three-yard 
touchdown run in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Casey also caught three passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns -- one of 28 
yards from Daniel Terry in the second quarter and one of 47 yards from Terry 
with 32 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we want to do, keep defenses honest," Casey said. "As long as I 
help my team, that's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
He helped all right. Casey accounted for 175 of Sylmar's 244 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
He also had touchdown runs of 19 and 16 yards nullified by holding penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Terry completed six of 14 passes for 139 yards and two touchdowns and threw two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar defense, led by linebacker London Woodfin, limited Verdugo Hills to 
109 yards in offense -- 28 in the second half. The Dons netted just 13 yards 
passing, misfiring on nine of 11 passing attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Vaughn and Girmar Johnson each had an interception for Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills played the last 15 minutes without starting quarterback Darryl 
Evans, who left the game in the third period because of a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar turned the ball over four times -- twice on fumbles, twice on 
interceptions -- and Verdugo Hills had three turnovers.

What can we say of North Hollywood's home opener against powerful Notre Dame 
High on Friday night? 
</P>
<P>
Well, they've installed some nice, new lights at the field. Which is 
significant, considering that the dim, yellow lighting in the past made it 
difficult to read a game program, much less a pass pattern. 
</P>
<P>
And about the game itself? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, those lights are really nice. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Huskies, though, the lights exposed to all present an 
outmanned and overmatched North Hollywood team that, try as it might, could do 
little in a 28-0 loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
And try the Huskies did, outhitting the Knights at every turn with an 
aggressive, angry defense. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, such defensive emotion translated into little offensively as North 
Hollywood (0-2) finished the evening still scoreless in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (3-0), meanwhile, was resting its starters by the fourth quarter. 
They were not, however, resting on any laurels. 
</P>
<P>
"We played lackluster," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said. "But North 
Hollywood played us tough. They hit hard." 
</P>
<P>
Having that relayed to him, Husky Coach Fred Grimes sadly pointed at the 
scoreboard. But that's just the coach in him. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies just flat couldn't match up with the bigger, more skilled Knights 
-- especially tailback Errol Small, who rushed for 108 yards in 21 carries, and 
quarterback Greg Andrachick, who completed six of 12 for 128 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Despite North Hollywood's efforts to concentrate on Small, the senior tailback 
was able to run for three first-half touchdowns on runs of three, two and six 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Two Notre Dame turnovers near the end zone -- Husky defensive back Larawn Moore 
intercepted a pass at the 13-yard line and recovered a fumble at the 17-yard 
line -- allowed North Hollywood to trail only 21-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Andrachick hit Kirk Miller with a 57-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter 
to close out the scoring.

Fairfax's Mario Mattison rushed for 204 yards in 27 carries, but his second 
fumble of the second half -- recovered by El Camino Real on the Lions' 34-yard 
line -- led to Anderson's score.

Grant Marches Through Marshall, Even Without Booker, in 20-7 Win 
</P>
<P>
With Grant High's best offensive player out because of a sprained ankle, the 
Lancers drove to scores as slowly as the team's bus on its return from 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Struggling without Shawn Booker, Grant (2-0) scored on two time-consuming 
drives and posted a 20-7 nonleague win Friday for its third consecutive victory 
over the Barristers. Booker scored three touchdowns last season against 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers' quickest touchdown came when Marlowe Lewis returned a blocked 
field-goal attempt 69 yards to give Grant a 14-7 lead with 1:22 left in the 
first half. The longest scoring drive, which came after the opening kickoff, 
took 10 minutes, 6 seconds. Grant moved 75 yards in 18 plays, Lewis scoring on 
a seven-yard quarterback option. Lewis was the leading rusher with 61 yards in 
11 carries. He also completed three of nine passes for 66 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Grant completed the scoring on a drive that consumed nearly seven minutes in 
the third quarter with Marcel Desir scoring on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall (0-2) took 13 seconds to tie the score after Marlowe's keeper when 
Danny Altruz returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards. Altruz had 181 yards in 
return yardage. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers were penalized 16 times for 122 yards. SEAN WATERS

Chatsworth 9, Monroe 0 -- Rayna Stewart intercepted a Jesse Wallace pass in the 
first quarter and returned it 38 yards for the game's only touchdown at 
Chatsworth. Joe Mier added a safety, blocking Garrit Maxwell's punt out of the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth (1-0) limited Monroe (0-1) to 18 yards in total offense and three 
first downs. Wallace completed just four of 14 passes for 46 yards, and the 
Vikings finished with minus-28 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chatsworth quarterback Brandon Ruedy failed to complete any of his 
three passing attempts, running back Kenya Smith rushed for 127 yards in 31 
carries as the Chancellors rolled up 154 yards in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe's anemic offense limited kicker Rachel Gagliano to just one play in her 
varsity debut, the kickoff opening the second half. DOUG JEFFREY

VIOLENCE IN THE TICKET LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Sylvie Drake's Sept. 14 Stage Watch report on how I was assaulted while in 
line to buy tickets at the James A. Doolittle Theater. The assailant was one of 
many scalpers, each purchasing 12 to 34 tickets for "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf." 
</P>
<P>
Easily 75% of the people in line were aged 12 to 18, giving this theatrical 
event the look of a Metallica concert. 
</P>
<P>
The Doolittle's Gordon Davidson is right in noting there is no law to stop 
ticket-buying abuse. However, L.A. theaters do have an obligation to honor 
customers' right to buy reasonably priced, quality seats without having to bow 
to violence or the greed of a few.

JOFFREY AT CAL STATE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Letter writer Peter Bretnall raised some important issues about the "expensive 
association" of Cal State L.A. and the Joffrey Ballet (Saturday Letters, Sept. 
9). He is correct in saying that under Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds expenditures 
have "run amok" while "real-world problems continue to fester." Unless James 
Rosser, Cal State L.A. president, has changed his management style, Bretnall 
would be refused any information on the cost involved, although the campus and 
the system are spending state funds. 
</P>
<P>
While many of us in the campus community would ordinarily be pleased to have 
Cal State L.A. associated with a splendid dance company, we deplore the fact 
that none of the faculty leadership was consulted or even informed, although 
the agreement could have a serious negative impact on the university's academic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey facilities are by far the most lavish and carefully constructed on 
our campus -- with the exception of the president's suite. Our faculty, 
students and staff have suffered for years from the conditions of our 
classrooms, faculty offices and restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Does the state really have enough money to pay for such an extravagant 
arrangement to satisfy the chancellor's and the president's need for public 
attention?

Actor Chris Burke has Down's syndrome and does not suffer from it, as stated in

STUTTERING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Kaye's Sept. 14 article, "Networks to Simulcast Animated Anti-Drug Show," 
showed insensitivity to stutterers. Kaye characterized the theme of the show as 
"J-J-J-Just Say No, Folks," even though no reference to Porky Pig was made at 
the press conference that announced the special. Is this an example of accurate 
reporting? 
</P>
<P>
Stutterers don't deserve to be made fun of by movies or television -- or the 
Los Angeles Times.

WILLIAM DAVILA IN RECITAL AT SOUTHWEST MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning with a first half of standard fare, followed by a latter half 
dedicated to works written within the last decade, a solo recital by guitarist 
William Davila provided laudable moments interspersed with less remarkable 
efforts in the Sprague Gallery at Southwest Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Davila is an accomplished guitarist, but often overly aggressive, sometimes 
allowing his tone to sound over-plucked. Flamboyantly beginning each set 
immediately upon sitting down -- without tuning -- also created conspicuous 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Of the new works presented Thursday evening, Deon Nielsen Price's engaging 
"Alma Jubilate" shone above the others in its sophistication and innovation. 
Borrowing repetitive, tonal ideas from the Minimalist school, the ambitious 
concoction uses pitch materials from the overtone series in combination with 
simple rhythms. Beverly Grigsby's "Serenade" fittingly provided lyrical 
elegance, while three jazzy etudes by James Wyble offered examples of 
considerable virtuosity, though lacking memorable expressivity. In encore, 
Davila performed his own New Age improvisatory work, "Inner Landscapes," which 
innocuously meanders around a pop chord progression and drone. 
</P>
<P>
Also presented were Marshall Bialosky's "Sor-ing," an uncomplicated 
juxtaposition of snippets from two minuets by Fernando Sor, and Andrea 
Saparoff's ponderous "Seria en Re," three sparsely textured but dissonant 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the program included pieces from the Renaissance and early 
20th Century. Of these, two preludes by Villa-Lobos best demonstrated Davila's 
talents as both a commanding and sensitive performer. 
</P>
<P>
Other notable efforts included variations by Gaspar Sanz, Sor and Antonio de 
Cabezon on the Folia -- a common melody and harmonic progression used in the 
Baroque era. Moreno-Torroba's virtuosic "Nocturno" also provided Davila an 
exemplary showpiece. GREGG WAGER

FAMILY SPOTS: AN ENTERTAINING LOOK AT OLD TESTAMENT TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "From Babylon to Nineveh" opening today at the Back Alley Theatre in Van 
Nuys, Putnam Lee turns the Old Testament into a one-man show. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting center stage with his guitar, Lee tells the audience about Adam and 
Eve, Noah and the Ark, the Tower of Babel, Daniel in the lion's den and more -- 
all on a level that will appeal to youngsters age 2 and up. 
</P>
<P>
The focus is on the literary and mythological aspects of the Bible rather than 
the religious. Commissioned by the Back Alley, the show has no religious point 
of view, presenting the stories in an entertaining way. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, a former Christy Minstrel, runs a nursery school in Santa Barbara where he 
has learned what makes kids listen -- and laugh. He includes plenty of audience 
participation in the 50-minute show, teaching youngsters songs and even 
inviting them on stage to do a few dance steps. 
</P>
<P>
The stage is set with a huge tent and Lee encourages the youngsters on stage to 
sing louder about the walls of Jericho, with surprising results. 
</P>
<P>
Performances are scheduled for Saturdays and Sundays, today through Oct. 29, at 
11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Tickets are $6.50. The theater is located at 15231 Burbank 
Blvd. For reservations, call (818) 780-2240.

DAY HIKE: ENJOY COASTAL VISTAS FROM THE TOP OF GAVIOTA PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Juan Crespi of the 1769 Portola Expedition dubbed the coastline here San 
Luis, in honor of the King of France. However, the soldiers of the expedition 
thought that La Gaviota, Spanish for sea gull, was a more apt description. 
</P>
<P>
This hike begins in Gaviota State Park and ends in Los Padres National Forest. 
You'll visit warm mineral pools, then continue to the top of Gaviota Peak 
(2,458 feet) for superb views of the Santa Barbara County coast. 
</P>
<P>
The inland portion of the state park is separated from the beach by U.S. 101. 
Located in a protected cove, Gaviota Beach is a popular year-round destination. 
The surf is gentle, but sometimes the wind whisks around Point Conception and 
cools down beach-goers. 
</P>
<P>
Near the beach are a campground and a picnic area. A long pier at the north end 
of the beach is popular with fishermen and sunset strollers. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: Thirty-five miles up the coast from Santa Barbara, 
exit U.S. 101 at the Lompoc/California 1 off-ramp. Turn east a short distance, 
then follow the highway frontage road a quarter of a mile to the end of the 
road and park in the Gaviota State Park parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Follow the fire road, which is strewn with rocks and eroded from 
winter floods. This is a well-used stretch of trail; most folks walk only to 
the hot springs and turn back. Soon, the noise of the highway fades away. A 
half- mile walk beneath oaks and old sycamores and up a moderate grade brings 
you to Gaviota Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The springs are more lukewarm than hot. Cross the rock dam and follow the trail 
uphill through steep brush a short distance to the fire road. Bear right. 
</P>
<P>
As you walk up the steep fire road, you leave behind the oaks and enter a 
typical chaparral community. Sometimes this can be a hot hike. During the 
winter months, however, it can be blustery up on this ridge route. At times you 
might be assaulted by clouds, which zoom past, enclosing you in fog for a few 
seconds. When you reach the top of the ridge, the trail bears right a quarter 
of a mile to the peak. Atop the peak is a radio relay tower. On clear days, 
much of the Santa Barbara County coastline as well as Channel Islands and Point 
Conception are visible.

10 CHOICE MUSEUMS: SMALLER FACILITIES EXUDE WARMTH AND INTIMACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIE DOUGLAS, Douglas is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All museums are alike in one way. They collect, preserve and display their 
collections, hoping to beguile and instruct visitors as they lead their 
imagination down new paths. Each museum, however, is different. They've chosen 
different areas of emphasis and different ways of displaying their wares. 
</P>
<P>
The following are small museums. They possess a warmth and intimacy that is 
often lacking in the larger establishments. They are seldom crowded and, 
usually, there are enthusiastic volunteers to answer your questions. Each 
offers the visitor an experience that is unobtainable elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Museum, 6755 S. Newlin Ave., Whittier, (213) 945-3871. A visit here is 
a delightful surprise. As you enter you suddenly find yourself on the main 
street of a small town during the early days of the century. A "Feed and Fuel" 
sign is to your left, and the brightly painted Whittier Register newspaper is 
located just down the way. 
</P>
<P>
The door to the Queen Anne cottage is open, and you can walk right in to admire 
the old harmonium and oak Hoosier kitchen cabinet. Children enjoy the cozy barn 
with its tools and saddles. There's also a handsome rooster, a fine testimonial 
to the art of taxidermy. While alive, this rooster was a longtime Whittier 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
Glass cases hold a wealth of Whittier memorabilia, and you'll see the desk 
former President Nixon used in his first law office, also the wooden shaving 
case President Lincoln used while traveling. Open Saturday and Sunday, 1 to 4 
p.m. Admission costs $1 for adults, 50 cents for seniors and 25 cents for those 
under 18. Free parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara Historical Museum, 136 E. De la Guerra St. Santa Barbara, (805) 
966-1601. A classic gas lamp stands just outside the museum's entrance. Inside 
are treasures from the past to tell the story of Santa Barbara's colorful 
history. There are documents, paintings, showy costumes and mementos from four 
eras: Indian, Spanish, Mexican and American. The courtyard of the museum is 
surely one of the most beautiful in the city. Free guided tours on Wednesday, 
Saturday and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. Open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m.; Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. (The Research Library is open to the public 
Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) Free admission and parking. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Maritime Museum, foot of 6th Street, Berth 84, San Pedro, (213) 
548-7618. Housed in what was formerly the Municipal Ferry Building, this 
unusual museum is crammed with nautical artifacts. The number of models of 
ships, including Theodore Roosevelt's "Great White Fleet," is staggering. 
There's an exact replica of the Titanic. It's 18 feet long and features the 
only known cutaway view of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Try your hand at the knot board. Samples of the Gordian monkey fist and 
Portuguese sennit are displayed, along with rope for duplicating them, but it's 
not easy. There are many fine examples of scrimshaw, also ships in bottles and 
an authentic Thai fishing boat. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Donations accepted. Free street parking. Wheelchair accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Municipal Museum, 3720 Orange St., Riverside, (714) 782-5273. 
Riverside believes in recycling historic buildings. This was once the Riverside 
Post Office. Built in 1912, it's a splendid edifice. The museum maintains 
collections in local history, natural history and anthropology. Exhibits depict 
the city's rich heritage from the DeAnza expeditions of 1774-76 into the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good museum for children. They cluster around the mounted specimens, 
such as a barn owl with babies, a skunk and a squirrel. Low to the floor in a 
glass case, visible to even the youngest visitor, is the skeleton of a fierce 
saber-toothed cat. The museum is open Tuesday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 
Saturday and Sunday, 1 to 5 p.m. Free admission and parking. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Asia Museum, 46 N. Los Robles Ave., Pasadena, (818) 449-2742. Grace 
Nicholson, a distinguished Pasadena collector and art dealer, built this 
magnificent Chinese palace during the 1920s. Everything is exquisite, whether 
it be porcelain, jade or lacquer. 
</P>
<P>
The central courtyard is lovely with flowers, weathered sculptures and 
exceedingly friendly koi. The Students Gallery is especially appealing to 
children, and there are four outstanding gift shops. Open Wednesday through 
Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Admission is $3 for adults, $1.50 for students and 
seniors, free for children under 12 and museum members. Lot parking $2. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ynez Valley Historical Museum, 3596 Sagunto St., Santa Ynez, (805) 
688-7889. There's a personal feeling here, because all of the exhibits have 
been donated by valley residents and the docents, who obviously, enjoy their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is divided into specialty rooms. Learn about branding irons and 
barbed wire in the West Room. Admire turn-of-the-century fans, beaded bags and 
wedding gowns in the Jeannette Lyons Room. Kids will revel in the Valley Room, 
where two models of the Ballard one-room school, antique toys and stereopticons 
with many slides are waiting. The Indian Room features rare Chumash baskets. 
The Pioneer Room shows the interior of a turn-of-the-century homestead. And in 
the Farm Machinery Annex you'll see old tractors and other farming equipment, 
including a walnut hauler. 
</P>
<P>
The Carriage House is well stocked with more than 30 carriages, wagons and 
carts. (One of the stagecoaches was held up a number of times.) Everybody's 
favorite, however, is the captivating animated village complete with gas 
station, barber shop, Chinese laundry and church. Press the button and 
everything comes alive. The barber shaves a customer, a lady fans herself, and 
a squirrel runs out of a log when a man hits the log with an ax. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 1 to 4 p.m. The Parks-Janeway 
Carriage House is open Tuesday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday, 1 to 4 p.m. Free admission and parking. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ynez Valley Historical Society also runs the Elverhoy Museum, 1624 
Elverhoy Way in nearby Solvang, (805) 686-1211. Open about a year, this museum 
includes an art gallery and items from the early Danish history of Solvang. 
Open Saturday and Sunday, 1 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
International Museum of Graphic Communication, 8469 Kass Drive, Buena Park, 
(714) 523-2080. George Bernard Shaw once wrote: "Well-printed books are just as 
scarce as well-written onces," but you'll see many of them at this new museum. 
Five centuries of printing growth are chronicled. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these antique machines work. Watch your own souvenir being printed on 
the Washington hand-lever press; it will be handed to you with the ink still 
damp. Almost 1,000 different items that are related to printing are displayed, 
and there's a realistic replica of a turn-of-the-century printing office, 
complete with roll-top desk and shallow cases for type. Open Tuesday through 
Saturday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults, 
$3 for seniors and students, $2 for children 12 and under. Free parking. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Museum, 241 S. Anaheim Blvd., Anaheim, (714) 778-3301. This building 
was designed by John C. Austin, the architect who was also responsible for the 
Los Angeles City Hall, Griffith Observatory and Shrine Auditorium. It is the 
last surviving Carnegie Library in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is devoted to exploring, exhibiting and explaining the history of 
Anaheim, the county's largest and oldest city. All kinds of paraphernalia from 
the citrus industry are featured, such as pickers' bags, a smudge pot and 
papers used for wrapping the exotic fruit. Agricultural Anaheim was changed 
forever when the Magic Kingdom opened in 1955. A model of Disneyland 
commemorates that momentous event. Open Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m.; Saturday, noon to 4 p.m. Closed Sundays and holiday weekends. Free 
admission and parking. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Bowl Museum, 2301 N. Highland Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 850-2058. 
Start your visit by viewing the 20-minute video that depicts the Bowl's 70-year 
history. Memorable performances range from "Carmen" to the Beatles. A new major 
exhibit, "Rhythms and Roots: Five Musical Families," spotlights five families 
of varying ethnic backgrounds. Each family has a fascinating history and a wide 
range of musical styles, including folk, popular, ritual, sacred and secular. 
There are more than 70 authentic items, such as Vietnamese opera costumes and 
Indian beadwork. Afterward, sample the music in one of the listening rooms. 
Open Tuesday through Saturday, 9:30-4:30. Free admission. Free parking when no 
concert is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte Historical Society Museum, 3150 N. Tyler Ave., El Monte, (818) 
444-3813. El Monte was once the end of the Santa Fe Trail, and this museum is 
lavishly stocked with the treasures of these early settlers. Stylish bonnets 
are on display at the hat shop, and the dress shop is supplied with chic 
costumes from 1870 to 1890. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a general store featuring everything from cigars (made in El 
Monte) to calico. A visit to this eclectic museum with its countless intriguing 
artifacts is a journey into the past. Open Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Donations welcome. Free parking.

ANGELS MUST PLAY INDIANS TWICE TODAY 
</P>

The remnants of Hurricane Hugo descended on Cleveland Municipal Stadium Friday, 
washing out the Angels' scheduled game against the Indians and setting up a 
doubleheader today at 10 a.m., PDT. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who lost a heartbreaking -- and maybe season-breaking -- 17-inning 
marathon to Cleveland Thursday night, aren't fond of doubleheaders. And with 
good reason. They are 1-7 in their four previous doubleheaders this season. 
</P>
<P>
A flash-flood watch was issued for Northern Ohio Friday night, and what's left 
of Hugo, by this time downgraded to a tropical storm, is supposed to keep 
dumping rain, and maybe even hail, here through today. So, with all due respect 
to Ernie Banks, today will likely be a lousy day to play two. 
</P>
<P>
If today's games are also postponed, the Angels and Indians would play a 
doubleheader Sunday. Both teams have Monday off, but a Rolling Stones concert 
is scheduled for Wednesday in the stadium, and the rock group's contract gives 
them two days before the event to set up the stage and sound system. If no 
agreement is reached, the Angels would probably have to return to Cleveland 
after the season to play, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
All of which put Angel Manager Doug Rader in a mood to match the weather . . . 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
"This stinks," he said, sitting in the stands under the shelter of the second 
deck and watching the rain pound on the tarpaulin covering the infield. "It's 
pretty hard to refute the numbers (regarding the Angels' lack of success in 
doubleheaders). I don't think I need to expound on it." 
</P>
<P>
The day off will at least provide the Angel bullpen with some rest. The Angels 
used six pitchers Thursday night. But Mike Witt, Friday's scheduled pitcher who 
will start the first game today against Cleveland's Bud Black, said he would 
have preferred to play Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just as tired as we are," he said. "And I was ready. But I'll be ready 
tomorrow, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who trail Oakland by 4 games, are running out of time, and a sweep 
today is almost a must to keep their division title hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends what Oakland does, but if we win two, that will take care of 
that," Witt said. "But we can't put too much pressure on ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland has been doing a pretty good job of that. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield, who had been on the disabled list since Aug. 11 with 
a broken bone in his left hand, was activated Thursday and rushed into action 
Thursday night. "I wasn't that surprised to pinch-run, but I was a little 
surprised when Doug Rader told me to go play shortstop," Schofield said. 
Schofield struck out in his only at-bat and winced noticeably when he fouled 
off a pitch. "It stung a little, but it's going to hurt for a while," he said. 
"I was kind of overmatched, though. I got thrown in there and was just trying 
to do my best, but it's kind of hard when you haven't faced live pitching in 
six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven (16-4) will face Tom Candiotti (12-9) in the second game today. . 
. . The rainout washed away an interesting lineup. Rader had Tony Armas playing 
right field, Dante Bichette in center field, Glenn Hoffman at first base, John 
Orton catching and Bobby Rose at third base. . . . The Angels met with Donald 
Fehr, the executive director of the players' union, Friday. "We're just getting 
prepared for what might happen," player representative Mike Witt said of the 
impending contract negotiations between the players and owners. "Fehr had a lot 
of optimism in his voice, and that's a good sign. But he told us about both 
sides of the coin." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Bryan Harvey, who lives in Catawba, N.C., said he had talked to his 
wife before the tail-end of Hurricane Hugo knocked out phone lines and that she 
said his house had suffered only minor damage from the front end of the storm. 
"We lost a few shingles is all," he said.

DODGERS OFFER PADRES HOPE, SNATCH IT BACK; 
</P>
<P>
LASORDA ENJOYS 2-1 BIRTHDAY WIN AS SAN DIEGO FAILS TO GAIN ON GIANTS 
</P>

<P>
The baseball came rolling across the field two weeks ago into the Padre dugout. 
Manager Jack McKeon picked it up and was about to toss it back when he noticed 
an inscription. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take care of the Giants for you." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon looked across the field. There was Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda waving. 
McKeon acknowledged him, smiled, and all of a sudden felt quite confident about 
the Padres' chances of catching the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for nothing, wise guy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, coming off three consecutive defeats at Candlestick Park, returned 
to Dodger Stadium Friday night and delivered what just might be the Padres' 
most damaging defeat of the season, 2-1, before a crowd of 24,887. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, what a scam it proved to be. 
</P>
<P>
They drive the Padres psychotic by leading late in each of the three games 
against the Giants, only to blunder their way into defeat. 
</P>
<P>
They tantalize the Padres by showing the Giants losing on their scoreboard, 
3-1, to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they show them the nearest couch for their breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same team that looked so hapless against the Giants? 
</P>
<P>
There was John Shelby covering center field like Willie Mays, catching 
everything in his path. 
</P>
<P>
There was Jose Gonzalez, starting in right field only because of Mike 
Marshall's injured back, hitting his first home run in six weeks, and just the 
third of the season. 
</P>
<P>
There was Tim Belcher pitching a three-hitter, with his only mistake occurring 
on a fastball to Benito Santiago that sailed over the center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
There was the Dodger middle-infield combination of Alfredo Griffin and Willie 
Randolph going four for eight with a double. 
</P>
<P>
Why, the Padres kept asking themselves, couldn't these guys do the same thing 
against the Giants? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't fault Tommy," McKeon said. "He didn't like losing those games against 
the Giants any more than we did. In fact, knowing Tommy, he hates the Giants 
worse than we do." 
</P>
<P>
Not to be nit-picking or anything, but isn't he the same guy who sold you on 
his Slim-Fast liquid diet? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I did lose nine pounds at the beginning," McKeon said, "but I gained it 
right back. I don't think I was following the directions right." 
</P>
<P>
And this is the same guy you put your faith in, to lend a helping hand? 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice," McKeon said, "but if we've learned anything these 
past few weeks, we learned we can't count on anyone. We had to keep winning 
ourselves, and we didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, quite cruelly, actually saved their ultimate tease for the ninth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts led off the inning with a walk. And when Jeff Hamilton's throw to 
second was too late on Roberto Alomar's sacrifice, the Padres had runners on 
first and second with the heart of their order up. 
</P>
<P>
All they needed was one hit into the outfield by their No. 3 through No. 5 
hitters to tie the game, and two hits to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn popped up to shortstop; Jack Clark fouled out to catcher, and Chris 
James fouled out to catcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres still remain mathematically in contention, five games behind the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, despite winning 24 of their past 31 games, they are in trouble. 
Big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Just eight games remain, and the Giants' magic number for clinching the 
division is down to four. 
</P>
<P>
What was an agonizing night for the Padres turned out to be quite a nice 
birthday party for Lasorda, who turned 62. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I'd like to get him," one Padre muttered. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda got a cake from Dodger owner Pete O'Malley with a replica of a baseball 
diamond. Lasorda didn't seem to notice that the player on the cake was wearing 
No. 7, instead of Lasorda's No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches and trainers gave him a portable compact disc player, complete with 
tapes of Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and Phantom of the Opera. 
</P>
<P>
There were balloons. There were flowers. There was candy. And, oh, how there 
were telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
One well-wisher even sent his birthday greetings by telex to Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, this is from Ron," Dodger publicity director Mike Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronnie who?" Lasorda barked. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronald Reagan," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda: "Oh, that Ron." 
</P>
<P>
It was a day on which Lasorda was even asked to be the grand marshall of a 
parade in Newark, N.J., where a street will be named after him. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I became a senior citizen," Lasorda proudly proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
He also became the most hated man in the Padre clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres retain reliever Mark Davis, as promised, they will have to shell 
out at least $6 million for three years, according to sources around the 
league. The Padres could have saved themselves about $3 million by signing 
Davis this spring when Alan Hendricks, his agent, informed the Padres that 
Davis would be willing to sign a two-year contract for $2.3 million. Padre 
President Dick Freeman turned down the deal. Now, six months and 41 saves 
later, the stakes have escalated and could rise even higher if the Padres wait 
until Davis files for free agency. "We're going to talk the moment the season 
ends," Padre General Manager Tony Siegle said. "There are no charades. We know 
what we're up against. We hold very few aces. But I guarantee you, we'll get it 
done. I just can't tell you how much it'll cost us." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Reds center fielder Eric Davis, eligible for free agency at the end 
of the 1990 season, is telling friends that playing for the Padres would be his 
first choice and playing for the Angels is his second. And the Dodgers? Not 
interested, Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
Although he totaled just three innings of work, Dodger pitcher Mike Morgan was 
thankful to have appeared in both the Wednesday and Thursday games in San 
Francisco. Before that, he had not appeared in 12 days. He openly wonders what 
happened to a pitcher who compiled a league-leading ERA throughout most of the 
season's first half. "I can see going with the younger guys, but what about the 
guys who have been here all year?" Morgan asked earlier last week. "I am 
thankful for everything they have done for me here -- my career has turned 
around here -- but I am just not sure what happened to my work." Morgan, who 
will be a free agent after the season, was cost a chance at qualifying for the 
league's ERA leadership by his recent inactivity.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
BIELECKI WINS NO. 17 FOR CUBS, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs have been full of surprises this season. Probably the biggest 
surprise has been pitcher Mike Bielecki. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki improved to 17-7 and moved the Cubs closer to the National League East 
title by pitching a strong six innings Friday at Chicago in the Cubs' 4-2 
victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Before Bielecki tired in the seventh, he held his former club to five hits and 
a run. The bullpen took over after the Pirates pulled within two runs, and 
Mitch Williams, another surprise, got the last two outs for his 35th save. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Grace drove in two runs and scored another as the Cubs reduced their magic 
number to five with their second consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Only two clubs in the league had worse pitching last season than the Cubs -- -- 
Atlanta and Philadelphia. Poor pitching accounted for a 77-85 record that left 
the Cubs 24 games behind the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
There was no reason to expect a change in Bielecki this season. In parts of 
four seasons with Pittsburgh and 19 games with the Cubs last year, the 
30-year-old right-hander was 12-19 with an earned-run average of 4.37. He had a 
reputation for seldom finishing what he started. 
</P>
<P>
He has completed only four of 32 starts this season, but with Williams around, 
that is not important. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bielecki, who has given up only eight earned runs to the Pirates in 34 
innings: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hold a grudge against the Pirates," said Bielecki, who was traded to 
the Cubs for Mike Curtis. "But I still have some good friends over there and I 
enjoy beating them. It's also time for us to prove we are the best team in the 
East. I want to do my part." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis not only didn't help the Pirates, he wasn't even in organized baseball 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Manager Jim Leyland is much more impressed with Bielecki than he was 
when the Pirates traded him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gone back to power pitching," Leyland said. "When he was with us, his 
back was bothering him, and I didn't get to see the real Mike Bielecki. He 
powered us." 
</P>
<P>
After the game, the Cubs announced that they have exercised the option on Andre 
Dawson's contract through next season. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 2, Philadelphia 1 -- The Cardinals seem to be in another hitting 
slump, but they managed to stay four games behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
With the Cardinals leading, 1-0, at St. Louis, former teammate Tommy Herr 
tripled and scored on Ken Dayley's wild pitch in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Cardinals loaded the bases in the 10th, and with two out, pinch-hitter 
Denny Walling singled in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth inning, Dayley, who had been trying to save the victory for Joe 
Magrane, worked out of a jam with the bases loaded and nobody out. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals have only eight games left but figure they have a chance if they 
can get within three games. The Cubs and Cardinals play their final three games 
of the season at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals had a runner on first with two out in the 10th when Ozzie Smith 
singled off Roger McDowell (4-8) and Jose Oquendo was given an intentional 
walk. Walling, batting .360 as a pinch-hitter, came through again. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Montreal 2 -- It's probably too late for the Mets. Despite Mark 
Carreon's home run that broke a 2-2 tie in the seventh inning at New York, they 
moved a little further away from winning their second division title in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Any combination of four Cub victories or Met defeats will prevent the Mets from 
repeating. They remained 5 1/2 games behind. 
</P>
<P>
Carreon, who has hit four pinch homers this season, enabled Ron Darling to 
improve to 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, San Francisco 1 -- Mark Portugal joined the Astros too late to pitch 
them to the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
But Portugal came within one out of a shutout at San Francisco as he beat the 
Giants for the third consecutive time and won his seventh in a row for the 
Astros. 
</P>
<P>
With San Diego losing, however, the Giants' magic number dropped to four. They 
might clinch before Will Clark returns from injuries he suffered when he 
collided with Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia Thursday night/ 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 8, Atlanta 3 -- Eric Davis has missed 29 games because of injuries 
and played in quite a few more when he wasn't physically at his best. 
</P>
<P>
But when healthy, Davis has had a big season. He hit his 34th home run to lead 
the Reds at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Robinson (5-3) gave up only four hits in six innings to win. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
BELL PICKS UP THE SLACK AGAIN FOR BLUE JAYS, 7-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the season, Fred McGriff was the Toronto Blue Jays' most valuable 
player. But with the pennant on the line, it is George Bell, once the target of 
Toronto boo birds, who is leading the team. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff has not hit a home run in the last 22 games, and the Blue Jays have 
struggled for runs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bell's bat has boomed. The two runs he drove in Friday night at 
Milwaukee to help the Blue Jays beat the Brewers, 7-3, came on grounders, but 
he has made most of his big hits this month. Although he has a nerve problem in 
his right elbow, he's still swinging. 
</P>
<P>
With the Orioles losing, the Blue Jays moved two games in front in the American 
League East, the closest race remaining. Both teams have eight games to play. 
They will play their final three games of the season at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
While going 4-5 in their previous nine games, the Blue Jays scored only 26 
runs. They pounded out 17 hits in this game. Only McGriff (0 for 4) failed to 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Manny Lee was three for five and drove in three runs, and Mookie Wilson went 
three for six to end a four-for-35 slump. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stieb (16-8) is another Blue Jay who has starred in the stretch run. He 
gave up a run and seven hits in seven innings to beat the Brewers for the fifth 
consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb was tough on the hot hitters. Bill Spiers, batting .391 in his previous 
12 games, was one for five, and Robin Yount, batting .378 in his last nine 
games, was one for four. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have my best stuff in the cold, windy weather," Stieb said. "But I 
seem to be lucky when I face the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt I got into a good rhythm. It was a battle almost every inning. I 
had to pick my pitches and do the best I could with them." 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers scored two runs off Jim Acker in the eighth, but Tom Henke pitched 
a scoreless ninth, striking out two. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, Lloyd Moseby and Wilson drove in runs with singles in the four-run fourth 
inning that made a loser of former Dodger Jerry Reuss (9-8). 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Baltimore 4 -- Things were looking pretty good for the Orioles at 
Baltimore. They scored four unearned runs in the fourth inning to tie the score 
and were on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
But Mel Hall, in an 0-for-16 slump, tagged Brian Holton for his 15th home run 
of the season to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Steve Balboni and third baseman Randy Velarde, whose error set up the 
Orioles' unearned runs, hit home runs off Dave Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Terrell (5-5), who had an earned-run average of 6.45 entering the game, 
was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to keep trying to win," said Steve Sax, who had three of the 
Yankee hits. "It's more fun going for the pennant, but you keep on trying." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 9-0, Seattle 2-2 -- When Bret Saberhagen gave up only three hits in 
seven innings to become the majors' first 21-game winner with his ninth 
consecutive victory in the opener of a doubleheader at Kansas City, the Royals' 
hopes were high. 
</P>
<P>
But then Bill Swift and two relief pitchers held the Royals to two hits and 
gave the Mariners a split. 
</P>
<P>
With only eight games remaining, the Royals trail Oakland in the West by 5 1/2 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"I did my best imitation of Bret Saberhagen," Swift said after improving to 
7-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals lost when Tom Gordon (16-9) walked four in 1 1/3 innings and gave up 
both runs. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, who lowered his ERA to a league-leading 2.27 in the opener, has 
nearly clinched the Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen is 17-2 since May 19, has won 12 of his last 13 starts and has given 
up only four hits in the last 14 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The doubleheader drew 29,286 fans, enabling the Royals to set an attendance 
record of 2,418,080 with two home games left. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 9, Detroit 7 -- The Tigers built a 6-0 lead after four innings at 
Detroit, then fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
After chasing Doyle Alexander with three runs in the sixth, the Red Sox went 
ahead with four in the seventh. A passed ball by catcher John Marzano enabled 
the Tigers to tie the score in the eighth, but Marzano made amends. His 
sacrifice fly drove in the winning run in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers need to win six of their last eight games to avoid losing 100 for 
the first time in their history.

ORIOLE SHORTSTOP IS NOT EXEMPT FROM CRITICISM

<P>
No wonder players say they never listen to talk radio shows. How could they 
stand to? 
</P>
<P>
Take the other day, on a Baltimore radio station. The subject, believe it or 
not, was "Cal Bashing," attacking the Orioles' Cal Ripken Jr. 
</P>
<P>
A woman named Mary got things rolling after someone had nominated Cal for Most 
Valuable Oriole. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the Most Disappointing Oriole," Mary insisted. 
</P>
<P>
She went on to say Cal should be batting 30 points higher, that he doesn't hit 
with runners in scoring position (especially with the bases loaded), and that 
Mark Belanger and Luis Aparicio were much better shortstops. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Robinson rates Cal one of the two best baserunners on the club," the 
station's host informed Mary. 
</P>
<P>
"Who you kidding?" she snapped. "He can't run. He's too big." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to admit," Vair said, "Cal does play an important leadership role." 
</P>
<P>
"Come off it!" Mary said. "Just watch him out there. He doesn't talk to 
anybody. He's no leader." 
</P>
<P>
Having trashed the Orioles' only sacred cow, Mary hung up. For the next 30 
minutes, other callers raged on about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
What are things coming to when the Orioles' only perennial All-Star is roughed 
up in his own town? 
</P>
<P>
Here's a guy, Cal Jr., who plays every inning of every game at a demanding 
position like shortstop, going errorless in his last 45 games, and who also has 
21 home runs and 90 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Merely being out there for 1,241 consecutive games is leadership of the highest 
order. 
</P>
<P>
And yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cal's batting average is slip-sliding away as the season comes to a conclusion. 
After going 2 for 26 in his last seven games, he's down to .260. The way things 
look, he'll finish in the .250s. 
</P>
<P>
He's batting .258 with men in scoring position. With the bases loaded, he's 1 
for 14 including his strikeout against Detroit Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
This would have been an ideal year for Cal to win the American League's Most 
Valuable Player Award, which he also won in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles have had an amazing year, and Cal is their best. But nobody wins 
the MVP award batting .250. 
</P>
<P>
Cal hit over .300 twice, in '83 and '84. He hit .282 in '85 and '86. He hit a 
career-low .252 in '87 and .264 last year. His extra base hits are declining. 
</P>
<P>
What's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
Every fan has an answer, the most popular being that Cal is simply worn down. 
Maybe he is, but with the club only one game behind Toronto and each game 
weighing a ton, the last thing Ripken is going to get is a rest. 
</P>
<P>
People on the club don't like to talk about Cal's negatives. They respect him 
too much for what he is -- a great, dedicated athlete who does a heroic job for 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
One man with the expertise to explain Ripken's problems is Tom McCraw, the 
club's batting instructor. To him there is no mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been an adjusting year for Cal," says McCraw, who has been in 
professional baseball for 30 years, 15 as a coach or instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was different when Cal had Eddie Murray hitting behind him, but when we 
went into this season we had only two proven hitters -- Cal and Phil Bradley, 
and Bradley is more of a top-of-the-order guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knew that Mickey Tettleton could hit 25 home runs. Nobody knew that 
Craig Worthington could be a 75-RBI man. Nobody knew what Randy Milligan could 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"So Cal felt he had to pull the whole wagon himself. He expanded his strike 
zone. He was overanxious, swinging at bad pitches. It was like having one 
Willie Mays on the club." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken's "expanded" strike zone seems to be reflected in his 51 walks, which is 
half his 1988 total. That includes a season-high three Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw believes it has been "a relief" to Cal to see players like Mike 
Devereaux, Milligan and Worthington deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a year to prove you can play in the big leagues," McCraw said. "These 
guys started off well, then the other clubs went to school on them and their 
averages dropped, and then our hitters adjusted and their averages crept back 
up. Devereaux went way down, under .240, at one point, but he's back up near 
.270 now."

CAPITALS TAKE A REST AFTER TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT FACHET, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it a once-in-a-lifetime experience, because there may never be another. 
</P>
<P>
After the Washington Capitals concluded their l6-day European tour with a 5-4 
victory over SKA Leningrad Thursday, Coach Bryan Murray was asked by a Soviet 
journalist if he would like to come back next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe some time in the future, but not next year," Murray replied. Later, 
beyond the risk of insulting his hosts, he elaborated, "Some time way off in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals returned Friday by Aeroflot charter from Leningrad and brought 
with them innumerable souvenirs, along with some pleasant memories and a 
feeling that bordered on exhaustion. Murray himself was ill and the 12-hour 
journey home was torture for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over. Now we rest for a few days and then we have a lot of hard work to 
prepare for the season," Murray said. "I think this trip will be beneficial. I 
certainly hope so." 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals won five of six games, a remarkable feat considering the travel 
involved, the unfamiliar surroundings and the oversized ice surface on which 
all of the games were played. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked before we left if I realized we could lose every game," Murray 
said. "It was not an unreasonable question. We had been practicing less than a 
week before our first game and we were playing good skating teams that had been 
in training for two months. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really liked was the way we battled back. We were down, 3-0, to 
Farjestads and won. We were down, 2-0, to Spartak and won, and we were down, 
3-0, to SKA and won. We showed mental toughness that just wasn't there in a lot 
of games last year." 
</P>
<P>
Murray thinks so much skating on the big rink will be a plus as far as 
conditioning goes. But he admits it is impossible to gauge whether the rigors 
of the journey will hang on long enough to affect the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 many of the players who participated in the Canada Cup got off to slow 
starts. Analysts are still unsure whether it was because they found 
regular-season NHL competition a drag after the high-powered Cup or whether 
other factors were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the upcoming exhibition games -- two against Boston and two against 
Philadelphia -- will provide a different sort of test. Some players prospered 
in the skating game in Europe. Others could not keep up with the speedy 
Soviets, but their physical presence will be needed to keep muscular NHL clubs 
honest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be different," said defenseman Neil Sheehy. "It's one thing to 
knock the Soviets around the way we were doing, but it's a different story when 
you know you're going to have to pay." 
</P>
<P>
It appears two NHL teams will be making the Soviet swing each season, with 
Montreal and the New York Rangers tentatively tabbed for next year. They will 
benefit greatly from the pathfinding efforts of Washington and Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be able to say we were first, but the teams that follow will have 
a much easier time," said marketing director Lew Strudler, the Capitals' 
troubleshooter. "I'm preparing a report on the tour, pointing out possible 
pitfalls and other things we would have done differently had we known." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the problems the Capitals faced could have been overcome had there been 
a greater understanding of the Soviet mind. It is not enough to accept the 
Soviets' assurances of "ne problema." One must dig deeper and insure that the 
details are being attended to. 
</P>
<P>
One can imagine the reaction of the huge New York and Montreal contingents to 
the news that greeted Washington's smaller group Wednesday in Leningrad: No 
outgoing phone calls until Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Munson Campbell, former president of the California Seals, accompanied the 
Capitals as a guest of NHL President John Ziegler. After viewing the 
incongruities of life in Moscow and Leningrad, Campbell put things in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"In Moscow they have chandeliers in the subway and you can't find a bar of 
soap," Campbell said. "In Leningrad they have the world's largest collection of 
Rembrandts and you can't drink the water." 
</P>
<P>
Each day in Leningrad, platters of cucumbers, tomatoes, grapes and other 
produce were placed before the Capitals. None of it was touched, because it was 
washed in city-supplied water that contains a nasty parasite called giardia 
lamblia that can make a visitor very ill. 
</P>
<P>
There was a choice: Insult the hosts and avoid waste in a nation in which food 
is in short supply or let it sit there and hope it wasn't thrown out. The 
Capitals chose the latter course, but Strudler will recommend that future 
visitors inform Leningraders they do not wish salads or fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing that mutton was scheduled for dinner in Moscow, Strudler worked 
with the Soviets to come up with more palatable entrees for the players. The 
joint operation resulted in excellent meals throughout the tour.

USD SEEKS BEST START SINCE 1983 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After two victories by a combined score of 43-6, the University of San Diego 
has the opportunity to begin the season 3-0 for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
USD plays at Claremont -- a school the Toreros have defeated each of the past 
two years, including 17-8 in 1988 -- this afternoon at 1:30. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing well offensively, defensively and on special teams," USD Coach 
Brian Fogarty said. "It's difficult to pinpoint any one area that has stood out 
above the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Fogarty figured that with seven starters returning from last season, the 
offense would be much improved, and it has been. With a grind-it-out, 
ball-control scheme, USD is averaging 329 yards per game (201 rushing, 128 
passing), including 280 in last week's 19-0 victory over Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, 280 yards, I would have been very happy," Fogarty said. "But this 
year I'm a little disappointed. I guess that shows what expectations can do." 
</P>
<P>
On defense, USD is allowing only 142.5 yards per game, with just 65 of those 
coming on rushes. Last year, USD set a school record allowing just 73 rushing 
yards per game and held Claremont to minus one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy the defense has come around the way we thought it would. We knew we 
had good players. It was just bringing them together in the right positions," 
Fogarty said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Bergmann kicked four field goals (23, 34, 40 and 46 yards) last week and 
has made five of five on the year. Six in a row would equal the school record 
set by Robert Lozzi in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Frinell of Fallbrook High averaged 12 yards on five punt returns and had a 
44-yard kickoff return last week. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont is coming off a 10-8 opening loss to Menlo in which the Stags fumbled 
for the fourth time on the Menlo one-yard line late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
USD linebacker Kurt Jafay will miss the remainder of the season with a neck 
injury. Jafay has a year of eligibility remaining but is scheduled to graduate 
this spring.

CHULA VISTA EARNS MIRA MESA'S RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
They were undefeated but nobody told them they were a good football team. 
</P>
<P>
So the players of No. 5 Chula Vista decided to do something about it. And they 
did, clubbing host Mira Mesa, 14-0, Friday night to improve to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista quarterback Derek Chapman led the way, completing 13 of 15 passes 
for 95 yards. His arm, and the slippery moves of running back Trenell Hicks (22 
carries, 90 yards), who scored an insurance touchdown with 4 minutes, 45 
seconds remaining in the third quarter, helped offset No. 6 Mira Mesa's size 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always looking for respect," Chapman said. "Every week you've got to 
earn respect." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista Coach George Ohnesorgen said: "I'll tell you our kids were pumped. 
Strongest doesn't always win." 
</P>
<P>
But a shutout, coach? 
</P>
<P>
"That just (shows) our kids' intensity." 
</P>
<P>
There was a brief moment midway through the third quarter when Mira Mesa's 
confidence swelled. Defensive back Steve Hamaguchi had just flattened Daniel 
Johnson, Chula Vista's tight end. Johnson had caught an eight-yard pass from 
Chapman. He fumbled. Mira Mesa (2-1) recovered and there were high-fives and a 
lot of yelling. 
</P>
<P>
One play later, Mira Mesa running back Wayne Pittman carried through the 
middle, was hit and fumbled. Charles Barnes recovered for Chula Vista, and the 
Spartans took control the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Souldn't have happened," Mira Mesa Coach Brad Giffith said. "I don't think we 
lost our confidence. Give the credit to Chula Vista." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa did manage to drive to Chula Vista's six-yard line early in the 
fourth quarter, but a holding penalty ruined the drive, and subsequently 
quarterback J.J. Rowlett (10 of 19, 143 yards) was sacked on fourth and eight 
from the 15. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista ran seven times in its nine-play, 55-yard scoring drive in the 
first half. Of course, when the drive began to slow down, Chapman did his 
thing, completing a 10-yard pass Brandon Gregg and a 12-yard pass to Neviette 
Richardson. Two plays later, running back Steve Gomez, a transfer from Mar 
Vista, scored from the three. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa chewed up its share of yards in the first half, but each time the 
Marauders got within striking distance they were either stopped by an 
aggressive Chula Vista defense or they stopped themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the second quarter, Mira Mesa drove 87 yards in 10 plays on an 
assortment of runs by Pittman, who runs over anybody in his way. He finished 
with 80 yards in 18 carries. Griffith opted to use Don Elder on fourth and goal 
from the three. He swept left for three two yards before running into a cluster 
of defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa appeared to be on its way to a touchdown in the first quarter, but 
Chula Vista linebacker Garland Phillips retreated into the territory where 
defensive backs are usually found and made a diving interception of Rowlett's 
pass.

FRIGHTENED WIFE FLED IN VAIN;

<P>
HUSBAND ARRESTED AFTER DEATH THREATS BECOME REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Elsa Miriam Cancel had sought help from the police, consulted a lawyer and 
finally fled her husband. But it was not enough to stop her death. 
</P>
<P>
The husband, Gabby Cancel, was arrested Friday after crossing into Mexico and 
is being held as a suspect in the shooting death of Miriam Cancel, 35, who was 
gunned down Thursday in a Santa Fe Springs clinic. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said Gabby Cancel, 65, was 
taken into custody by Sheriff's Department homicide detectives, San Diego 
border agents and Mexican federal police, who were holding him in a Tijuana 
jail cell until he he could be transported to Los Angeles. It was unknown when 
that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tracked Wife to Clinic 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Miriam Cancel who witnessed the shooting told detectives that Gabby 
Cancel had tracked his wife to the Riviera Medical Clinic, demanded to see 
their child and then shot her three times, making good on a threat he had 
reportedly issued time and again. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions in the Cancels' marriage had escalated in recent weeks, after Miriam 
Cancel discovered that her husband was simultaneously married to another woman, 
according to Miriam Cancel's friends and a sister. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Cancel learned of the other woman when she found income tax returns and 
auto insurance papers for Gabby Cancel's late-model Cadillac. The forms listed 
the other woman as his wife, said Miriam Cancel's sister, Norma Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
The Cancels were also fighting over custody of their 6-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, Gabby Cancel was arrested and booked on a spousal battery charge, 
but he made bail and was released, said Lt. Rob Watters of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Rampart Division. A trial was pending. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Gabby Cancel filed a petition in Superior Court seeking an 
order to prevent Miriam Cancel from taking their child, Gabby Jr., out of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petition for Support 
</P>
<P>
She was planning to counter with a petition for support and orders to keep 
Gabby Cancel away from her and the child, said Miriam Cancel's attorney, 
William Hinz. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been sitting here all day, saying what could we have done? There is not 
anything (lawyers) can do . . . to stop someone bent on homicide," Hinz said 
from his office Friday afternoon. "Restraining orders are only good for someone 
who is law-abiding. . . . That's part of the real shame of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cuellar and Carmen Semidey, a friend of Miriam Cancel and manager at the 
clinic, said Miriam Cancel had reported her husband's abuse to the police, had 
told them he was impersonating a police officer and asked that they take away 
his gun. 
</P>
<P>
Cuellar and Semidey complained bitterly that the police "did nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Watters said he was not aware of any reports from Miriam Cancel beyond the 
Aug. 1 arrest. But he conceded that there was little chance of arresting 
someone just because they make threats. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Cuellar said, Gabby Cancel regularly beat his wife, 
disconnected the telephone, locked the doors so she could not escape and 
threatened her 14-year-old son with a pistol that he always carried. 
</P>
<P>
"All the time, he would threaten and threaten her," Cuellar said. "If she left 
him, he would say he would kill her." Finally, she left two months ago, but he 
would continually track her down, Cuellar and Semidey said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 18, Gabby Cancel called the police to report that his wife and a man 
had pointed a gun at him. But police scoffed at the report. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal belief is that he was just stating that to mitigate things in 
court or get even, I don't know which," Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Station Numerous Times 
</P>
<P>
Watters said Gabby Cancel had called the police station numerous times to ask 
that his battery case be dropped. He had also been very angry at having been 
put in jail for beating his wife. "He indicated he didn't think we could do 
that to him," Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabby Cancel's lawyer in the child custody case did not return a reporter's 
telephone call Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew the Cancels described Gabby Cancel as an apparently well-heeled 
businessman, a longtime resident of the area who often packed a pistol and 
boasted about working as a police officer. There are no records to indicate 
that he ever worked as a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
He ran a small shop called the Botanica Broadway on Beverly Boulevard. It was 
closed Friday, but signs advertising medicinal herbs, candles used for 
religious ceremonies, incense and magical love potions could be seen through a 
window. 
</P>
<P>
The men who work at a tire repair shop up the street from Botanica Broadway 
said the Cancels always seemed to get along well, that Gabby Cancel had been 
especially happy when Miriam Cancel was pregnant. But about three months ago, 
they said, the tenor changed. 
</P>
<P>
"All he would talk about is how his wife had betrayed him, had taken his money, 
was taking the child," Daniel Mena said. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Cancel came to the United States seven years ago from her native 
Honduras. She met Gabby Cancel, who said he was from Puerto Rico, when she 
needed a notary public -- a service he also provides out of the Botanica 
Broadway shop -- and they married six years ago, Cuellar said.

CITY ETHICS PANEL CALLS FOR HIRING OF SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The staff of Mayor Tom Bradley's commission on ethics recommended Friday that 
the city hire special prosecutors to "perform full-scale investigations" of 
public officials suspected of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to commissioners, the staff recommended that special prosecutors be 
granted legal powers far greater than those of the city attorney, including the 
authority to subpoena witnesses and question them under oath. 
</P>
<P>
"The arguments for and against a special prosecutor have been well developed in 
the course of the investigation of Mayor Bradley," the staff wrote. "We believe 
that it is important that the public perceive that decisions regarding 
prosecution of its elected officials be the product of independent 
investigation and judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley -- who created the Commission to Draft an Ethics Code for Los Angeles 
City Government in April, after questions were raised about his employment by a 
bank that conducted business with the city -- has pledged to abide by the 
panel's findings and seek to have its recommendations adopted into law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect on Mayor Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
But while it appears that the commission will call for extensive reforms in the 
city's ethics code and enforcement, its recommendations are not likely to have 
an effect on the inquiries into the mayor and his finances. The changes in city 
law necessary to establish the process for appointing special prosecutors could 
take years to complete, commissioners said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and his professional relationship with a bank that did business with 
the city has been investigated, along with other allegations of conflict of 
interest, by the city attorney and city controller. No criminal charges have 
been brought, but the city attorney filed a civil lawsuit against Bradley 
earlier this month alleging errors in his financial disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
Commission staff member Bert Deixler said Friday that conducting an 
investigation with the limited powers of the city attorney -- who in the 
Bradley probe was not empowered to issue subpoenas or force witnesses to 
testify under oath -- is like having "one hand tied behind your back." 
</P>
<P>
Providing for appointment of special prosecutors in corruption cases is just 
one of several ways the commission staff recommended the city bolster 
enforcement of ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
At the proposal's core is the formation of an independent city ethics agency to 
monitor campaign and other financial disclosures, investigate breaches of the 
ethics code and prosecute offenders civilly. It is this office that could seek 
appointment of a special prosecutor by applying to a panel of three judges, who 
would then make a selection. 
</P>
<P>
The staff also recommended that the city attorney be granted greater legal 
powers and authority to investigate and prosecute ethics breaches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Private Attorney General' 
</P>
<P>
And, as the ultimate backstop, the staff proposed that private citizens be 
empowered to bring actions against officials as "private attorney general . . . 
if the independent agency or other existing governmental agencies did not 
initiate such actions" within a reasonable time period. Citizens would be 
allowed to sue for injunctive relief and financial penalties and would be 
entitled to keep half of all fines ultimately levied in a case. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to send a message that a breach of ethical standards will be found out 
and punished," said Deixler, a former prosecutor now in private practice who 
helped prepare the report. "Compliance is the goal. And scrutiny is the way to 
obtain it." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners, who will make their final report to the mayor and City 
Council in November, appeared to be generally in favor of the recommendations, 
though Commissioner Gilbert Ray cautioned that "I'd like not to invent a cannon 
to kill flies." 
</P>
<P>
Ray, an attorney with the powerful downtown law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, 
said he did not want to "create a huge bureaucracy that would investigate once 
a year." 
</P>
<P>
Any ideas the commission endorses would become law at the mayor's direction, 
action by the City Council and potentially through a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a proposal with the maximum potential of being adopted," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Ray's concerns, the idea of an independent agency and mechanism for 
appointing special prosecutors appeared to be accepted by other commission 
members and was quickly endorsed by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who appeared before 
the commission Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are circumstances where a special prosecutor is desirable," 
Reiner said. "In fact, there are circumstances where a special prosecutor is 
essential." 
</P>
<P>
The concept was also embraced by City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who has often 
criticized the city's investigation of Bradley as flawed because the city 
attorney lacked important law enforcement tools, such as subpoenas to compel 
testimony and authority to place witnesses under oath. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we've gone through the process, many of us sense deficiencies. This 
(proposal) could be a good way to address those deficiencies," said Molina, who 
is a member of the council's ad hoc committee on ethics. "I think all of us in 
council are looking for a way to put that (special prosecutor) mechanism in 
process. This might be the way." 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff report said "the public has a particular concern in 
ensuring that such judgment is made fairly and independently." 
</P>
<P>
The staff report on ethics enforcement submitted to the commission Friday is 
the last of six reports covering the spectrum of ethical issues in government 
service, including financial disclosure, outside income and employment by 
public officials, conflicts of interest, campaign finance and ethics education.

GALAS, AWARDS TO MARK MUSIC CENTER'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Music Center tonight begins a star-studded weekend of galas and 
performances marking the downtown landmark's 25th anniversary and the debut of 
its Dorothy B. Chandler Performing Arts Award. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the weekend will be a 25th anniversary program Sunday at the 
performing arts center, featuring performances by all of the Music Center's 
resident companies: the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Master Chorale (Bach 
Cantata No. 50, "Te Deum"), the Joffrey Ballet ("Parade" and the Russian dance 
from "The Nutcracker"), the Los Angeles Music Center Opera ("Stay the Night" 
and "Alabama Song" from "Mahagonny"), and the Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper 
Forum (selections from "Stand Up Tragedy"). 
</P>
<P>
The event, which will be taped for national broadcast in January, will also 
include the first presentation of the Chandler Award to three up-and-coming 
artists in the fields of music, dance and theater. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Olson Livingston, co-chairwoman of the Music Center's 25th anniversary 
year, said dhat including all the resident groups was vital to "establishing a 
presence of who we are -- that we're not just music, but ballet, opera, music 
and theater." Doing so has made the production a complicated undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of putting this show together was really to work with each of 
the different artistic companies involved and coordinate the image that each 
wanted to present and get it all together on one stage," producer-director Don 
Weiner said. "There's such a diversity and range of elements that we're doing 
on the show, and it's been a great challenge for us to pull it all together as 
one evening's entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Music Center officials plan for the awards ceremony -- which will be televised 
Jan. 14 on PBS -- to become an annual event, similar to Washington's 
prestigious Kennedy Center Honors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Violinist 
</P>
<P>
Honored at the Music Center will be 17-year-old violinist Midori, who started 
practicing her craft at age 4 and has already played with many of the world's 
orchestras; post-modern choreographer Charles Moulton, a 1983 Guggenheim Award 
winner who has his own New York-based dance company; and writer, director, and 
set, costume and puppet designer Julie Taymor. In addition to the award itself, 
each winner will receive a $25,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand will be New York Philharmonic Music Director Zubin Mehta, who was 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic's music director from 1962-78; Suzanne Farrell, 
who as a principal dancer for the New York City Ballet created 23 new roles 
especially choreographed for her by George Balanchine; and Harold Prince, a 
15-time Tony Award winner and the director and/or producer of 47 theater 
productions, including "Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled hosts for the Sunday evening event include Bob Hope (who was at the 
Music Center's opening 25 years ago), Kirk Douglas, Carol Burnett, Gregory 
Harrison, Jane Seymour, Richard Thomas, Judd Hirsch, Andy Williams, Lynn 
Redgrave, Henry Winkler, Edward James Olmos, Neil Simon, Michael Landon and 
Dina Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Center 
</P>
<P>
Their jobs will be not only introducing performers, but in the spirit of the 
Music Center's 25th anniversary, outlining the history of the center and its 
resident groups. Also included will be a performance by frequent Music Center 
performer Rosemary Clooney, and -- for television audiences only -- a taped 
opening segment by Placido Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
The new award is named for the Music Center founder and the wife of Norman 
Chandler, the late publisher of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The cast bronze and gold-leaf sculpture of a nude woman's torso was designed by 
Los Angeles artist Robert Graham, who also sculpted the landmark "Olympic 
Gateway" in front of the Memorial Coliseum for the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The Chandler Award will be unveiled tonight at the Huntington Library, Art 
Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino. About 600 patrons who 
contributed $25,000 a couple to the Music Center for its 25th anniversary will 
be in attendance.

PART OF HAHN PARK CLOSED AFTER TESTS REVEAL TOXINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A section of Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area acquired in recent years for 
$8.7 million has been closed off so the area can be tested for hazardous 
substances, according to Los Angeles County health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary tests found toxic material present in the soil, but not at 
concentrations that would be dangerous to the public, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Development of the 135-acre area in Baldwin Hills has been at a standstill 
since Feb. 1 after two workers complained of headaches, skin irritation and 
nausea while grading the property, an aide to county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn 
confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the workers' illnesses was never determined, but costly tests were 
ordered because "we have to make sure that we're not inviting people to a park 
where there is any kind of danger," said Hahn deputy Burke Roche. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to find out more about the possible hazard, county officials spent 
$129,100 to hire a private consultant, Radian Corp. 
</P>
<P>
County rules require that contracts exceeding $75,000 come to the Board of 
Supervisors for approval. But Carl Wada, project manager of the county Internal 
Services Department, said that officials drafted two contracts, for $68,090 and 
$61,010, in order to bypass the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to get going real quick," he said. Wada said there was no effort to 
hide the matter from the public, pointing out that a citizens' advisory panel 
for the park was notified. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary tests have detected a number of suspected cancer-causing 
substances, including benzene and chrysene. But so far, none of them has been 
found in heavy enough concentrations to be considered a threat to public 
health, said Frank Cervantes, a hazardous materials specialist for the county 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, are they at a concentration or level where they can impact 
the public health?" he said. "The answer is probably not." But further testing 
is required, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, yes, I'd take my kids to play there," he added. "We have about 
a 90% chance of being assured that we don't have a problem there. I should go 
higher, but I don't want to stick my foot in my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes pointed out the area, site of a former oil field, contains "oil field 
wastes" typical of what can be found all over Southern California, once dotted 
with oil derricks. "These petroleum hydrocarbons are deep enough that they 
should not pose a problem to anybody on the surface," he said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they are exploring the possibility of mixing the 
contaminated soil with "clean" soil to dilute any hazardous substances and then 
covering the area with a 10-foot-deep layer of dirt. Cost of this remedy has 
not been estimated, but the county earlier estimated that it could cost up to 
$32 million to haul away all contaminated earth for disposal at a hazardous 
waste site. 
</P>
<P>
The area being tested, along La Brea Avenue north of Stocker Street, includes 
the former site of the Baldwin Hills Dam and is proposed for passive 
recreational use, such as picnicking, said Jim Park, principal planner for the 
county Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
It was acquired by the county and state for about $8.7 million between 1985 and 
1987 as an addition to the original 183-acre park named after the area's 
long-time county supervisor. Although a state park, it is operated by the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Park said the latest tests provide a "very expensive confirmation" of tests 
conducted before the property was acquired by the county and state. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn spokeswoman Lynn Sakamoto said: "The supervisor has been kept abreast of 
everything that is going on, and the health department and other officials have 
expressed to him that there is no reason for alarm. We're going to wait and see 
what the final report says." 
</P>
<P>
PARK AREA TESTING 
</P>
<P>
1. The development of a recently acquired section of the Kenneth Hahn State 
Recreation Area has been at a standstill while county health officials test for 
the presence of hazardous substances. 
</P>
<P>
2. The remainder of the park remains open to the public and has not been 
subject to testing.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATHLETIC FOUNDATION BUYS SPORTS LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, the successor to the Los 
Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, has announced that it has purchased the 
San Jose-based National Library of Sports and will move its 250,000 items to 
its own sports library in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
No purchase price was disclosed. But David L. Wolper, chairman of the 
foundation board of directors, said the acquisition will make the group's Paul 
Ziffren Sports Resource Center Library at 2141 W. Adams Blvd. the largest 
sports library in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the items purchased include books dating to the 19th Century, 
professional and collegiate basketball media guides and game programs, books 
and magazines on outdoor sports such as hunting and fishing, and items on horse 
racing and bullfighting. There is also an index of 175,000 sports 
personalities, facilities and events with 1.5 million references to a news 
clipping file. 
</P>
<P>
The Ziffren Center Library is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday 
and from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., on alternating Saturdays.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARRESTED AFTER 125-M.P.H. CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chase through the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys at speeds up to 125 
m.p.h. ended Friday when a stolen car was rammed by a California Highway Patrol 
car in Newhall, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Yanacek, 21, and Michael Distefano, 22, both of North Hollywood, were 
arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto after the chase ended at 2:30 a.m. on 
San Fernando Road near 4th Street, the CHP reported. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began in North Hollywood when Los Angeles police officers spotted the 
stolen Acura Legend and attempted to pull it over. The car sped away on 
Vineland Avenue and entered the Golden State Freeway, heading north at speeds 
ranging from 100 to 125 m.p.h., CHP reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The car took the Lyons Avenue exit in Newhall and drove 100 m.p.h. on surface 
streets until it crashed through a construction barrier on San Fernando Road 
and slowed down on a gravel road, the CHP said. When the car attempted to turn 
back onto San Fernando Road, a CHP vehicle rammed it.

</P>
<P>
Dobson has starred on the CBS prime-time soap "Knots Landing." He said the 
clothes, including brand-name jeans and socks, were worth about $500. After 
being held as evidence they were turned over to the mission.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'HILLSIDE STRANGLER' BIANCHI GETS MARRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two Hillside Stranglers who terrorized Los Angeles 
in the late 1970s, has married his Louisiana pen pal after meeting her for the 
first time this week, prison officials said Friday in Walla Walla, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi, 38, wore a black tuxedo and Shirlee Joyce Book, 36, of Monterey, La., 
wore a white wedding dress with a small veil during the 15-minute ceremony in 
the prison chapel Thursday morning, Washington State Penitentiary spokesman 
Richard Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer said it was the first marriage for Bianchi, who is serving a life term in 
prison for killing two Bellingham, Wash., women. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi also pleaded guilty to the murders of five young women in Southern 
California and was a key witness against his adoptive cousin, Angelo Buono, who 
was convicted in nine of the 1977 and 1978 sex-and-strangulation slayings. 
</P>
<P>
The killings were attributed to the Hillside Strangler because many of the 
victims' bodies were found on hillsides in Los Angeles and Glendale. The 
killings were the subject of a TV movie this year. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi, who claims to be a born-again Christian, started corresponding with 
Book in 1986 and had talked to her by telephone, but met her for the first time 
Wednesday, Bauer said.

JEWISH CALENDAR STARTS WITH ADAM SYMBOLISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLEN S. MALLER, Special to Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christians know that the Christian calendar starts from the birth of Jesus. 
Muslims know that the Muslim calendar begins with the flight of Mohammed from 
Mecca to Medina. 
</P>
<P>
But most Jews would be hard pressed to explain what happened 5750 years ago and 
why the Jewish calendar begins with that event, which will be commemorated this 
year on Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, begins the introspective 10-day period 
called the High Holy Days, culminating at sundown on Yom Kippur, Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
By analogy to the Christian and Muslim calendars, it might be expected that the 
Jewish calendar would start either from the birth of Abraham (the first Jew) or 
from the Exodus out of Egypt (the birth of the Jewish people). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Choose Starting Point 
</P>
<P>
Yet the rabbis in the 2nd Century who made up the current Jewish calendar chose 
as their starting point the estimated time that Adam left the Garden of Eden. 
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew word "Adam" means humankind -- the species. The first Adam 
represents civilized humankind. The exit of Adam from the Garden of Eden 
symbolizes the transition of humankind from a largely Stone Age state of 
hunters and gatherers to the more advanced Bronze Age society of farmers and 
city dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
When did this take place? The most famous attempt to calculate "the beginning" 
was that of James Ussher, an Irish bishop who wrote a book on biblical 
chronology in the early 1650s. He sets the date of the departure from the 
Garden of Eden in the year 4004 BC. 
</P>
<P>
Although it might seem like a simple task to add up the life spans of the 
generations mentioned in the Bible, it is not. First of all, the Greek 
translation, the Septuagint, reports very different figures from those given in 
the Hebrew Bible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
160-Year Underestimate 
</P>
<P>
A second problem arises when there is no continuity of generations. Thus the 
estimate of the time back to Adam made by Rabbi Yosi ben Halafta in his 
2nd-Century book, "Seder Olam Rabbah," was too short because Rabbi Yosi 
underestimated the length of the Persian Empire by about 160 years. The current 
Jewish calendar is based on his chronology. According to this, Adam exited the 
Garden of Eden and became civilized in the year 3760 BC. With the addition of 
the 160 years, Rabbi Yosi's date is within a century of Bishop Ussher's. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to estimate when humankind became civilized is to use the evidence 
of archeology. Most archeologists believe this fundamental development in human 
evolution took place in the Tigris/Euphrates Valley almost 6,000 years ago.

BRONCOS' HUMPHREY IS MAKING GOOD ON CHILDHOOD DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Marlene Humphrey was in the kitchen when her son, Bobby, interrupted, tugging 
on her skirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Mama, come here and look at this football game on TV," Bobby said. "One day 
I'm going to be playing on TV." 
</P>
<P>
She paid scant attention, passing it off as the chatter of a small boy. 
</P>
<P>
But last Monday night, 20 years later, Marlene Humphrey saw her son play for 
the Denver Broncos in a nationally televised game against the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-1, 202-pound tailback, Humphrey is the leading rookie rusher in the 
American Football Conference going into Sunday's game against the Raiders in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Some dreams do come true, but not always without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Humphrey's football career almost ended before it began. 
</P>
<P>
When Humphrey was a freshman at Glenn High School in Birmingham, Ala., his 
mother feared that he would get hurt playing football. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought him a trumpet because I wanted him to play in the band," Marlene 
Humphrey said. "His older brother wanted to play football, too, and I bought 
him a trombone and it got his mind off sports. I thought, 'It worked for my 
older boy, and it would work for Bobby.' But he was mad every time he went to 
play it." 
</P>
<P>
And Humphrey joined the football team, anyway, trying, unsuccessfully, to keep 
it from his mom. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I came home late after playing a game, and she wondered where I'd 
been," he said. "But I showed her the MVP trophy that I'd gotten in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Although his mother relented, Humphrey faced another obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Wendell Jones, the varsity coach, thought that Humphrey, who weighed 145 
pounds, was too small for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"After Bobby finished elementary school, his father brought him down to meet 
me," Jones said. "I didn't pay any attention because he was such a little 
skinny kid. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that the B team practice would be next week. They drove off and 
then his dad came back and told me that Bobby was good enough to play on the 
varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"But one day in practice I put him in and, shucks, this kid could run the 
football. After the third ballgame, he was starting for us as a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey blossomed into an extraordinary prep football player on a team that 
never won more than four games in any season he was there. 
</P>
<P>
After rushing for more than 4,000 yards, Humphrey was recruited by 150 colleges 
before signing with Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey had dreamed of playing for the Crimson Tide. He had parked cars and 
sold soft drinks at Alabama games at Legion Field, which was across the street 
from the housing project where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd sell Cokes for the first three quarters and then, if I'd made enough 
money, I'd watch the fourth quarter," Humphrey said. "It was a way to see the 
game for free and make some money. I usually made about $50 from the games." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey flourished at Alabama, where he became the school's rushing leader 
with 3,420 yards and 45 touchdowns. He was touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama also promoted Humphrey's All-American image. A social-work major, he 
said he wanted to return and help clean up the drug- and gang-infested 
neighborhood of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey was even in a gang -- E Phi P -- as a youngster, before his mother 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a gang like they have today, shooting and killing," Marlene Humphrey 
said. "Compared to the gangs they have today, that was like a prayer meeting. 
But I didn't want him involved in all of that stuff because I didn't know where 
it would lead." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey said the gang had been formed to protect the neighborhood from rival 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a territorial gang," Humphrey said. "We didn't go out seeking trouble, 
but if trouble came to us we got involved." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey's image took a beating during the summer of 1987. He suffered a broken 
jaw when he was hit with a crowbar in an altercation at a popular nightspot in 
Tuscaloosa. The attack, which officials said was unprovoked, was a case of 
mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey prefers not to discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"When you bring that up, it makes me out to be the wrong type of person," 
Humphrey said. "I'm not the type of guy you read about in the paper who was out 
fighting somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that injury, Humphrey returned for his senior season, but it quickly 
turned into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
After suffering a stress fracture in his left foot in spring practice, Humphrey 
broke a bone in the same foot in Alabama's second game and sat out the rest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
He wore a cast for six weeks and underwent two operations, having a pin 
inserted in his foot. He wasn't able to run full speed until June. 
</P>
<P>
He said the nine-month rehabilitation was depressing. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was able to overcome that with the help of my mother," Humphrey said. "I 
just sat back and prayed and hoped that everything was going to turn out all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Although he received an extra year of eligibility because of the injury, 
Humphrey decided to forgo his senior season at Alabama to make himself eligible 
for the National Football League draft. 
</P>
<P>
Why did he leave college early? 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that after playing there for three years, it was time to move on," 
Humphrey said. "Even though my heart was still there, I felt it was time for me 
to move on to bigger and better things and go on to become a successful man in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have nightmares about leaving. In the back of my mind, I think that I 
could have been a competitor for the Heisman Trophy this year. But I had to 
move on and move ahead in life." 
</P>
<P>
After 16 teams had passed, the Broncos selected Humphrey in the supplemental 
draft. They had to give up their No. 1 pick in the 1990 draft to select him. 
</P>
<P>
Why did so many teams pass him by? 
</P>
<P>
One NFL player personnel director cited the foot injury and said that Humphrey 
had not run a particularly good time in a 40-yard dash at a workout where 
scouts were present. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos took a chance on Humphrey because they were desperate for a speedy 
running back to complement quarterback John Elway. Although Elway passed the 
Broncos to consecutive appearances in the Super Bowl, Denver has long lacked a 
good running attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos drafted Steve Sewell of Oklahoma in 1985, but he has been better at 
catching passes than running. Denver signed Tony Dorsett last season, but his 
best days were behind him, at 35. In the final four games, he rushed for only 
125 yards. The Broncos brought Dorsett back to camp this season, but he 
suffered a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
After a 21-day holdout during training camp, the Broncos signed Humphrey to a 
four-year, $2.045-million contract that is heavy with incentive clauses. 
</P>
<P>
He had a quiet opener, rushing six times for 15 yards against Kansas City, but 
gained 76 yards in 10 carries in the Broncos' 28-14 victory over the Bills 
Monday night. He scored a touchdown and helped to set up another with a 33-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby Humphrey is an exceptional talent," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said. "He's 
got great explosion and great acceleration. He senses daylight very well and 
has that great instinct that natural runners have." 
</P>
<P>
Although Humphrey is playing behind Sammy Winder, Reeves has said privately 
that it's only a matter of time before Humphrey is the starter. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver media have already compared the rookie to the two leading rushers in 
Bronco history, Otis Armstrong and Floyd Little. 
</P>
<P>
"It's given me a thrill being compared to Armstrong and Little," Humphrey said. 
"It gives me that extra incentive to go on and prove that I can be the best."

MAJKOWSKI IS ABLE TO PUT PACKER LEGENDS TO REST, FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are worse fates than to have your name end in ski, and play quarterback 
for the Green Bay Packers. After all, America's Dairyland, which is stuffed to 
the gills with west Slavic types, takes kindly to tall, blond, Polish-surnamed 
players who might finally bring its beloved Pack back. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you would never have known it as the Packers began the second 
quarter of last Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints at Lambeau Field. 
Trailing, 21-0, the Packers couldn't do anything right. 
</P>
<P>
And the worst offender, according to the boos that day, was former crowd 
sweetheart Don Majkowski (Ma-KOW-skee), who completed his first two passes but 
then couldn't hit the side of a silo, much less a receiver's hands, for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski threw a first-quarter interception that resulted in a Saint 
touchdown. He fumbled in the second period but managed to recover that bobble. 
He had as bad a start as a quarterback could never hope for -- and don't think 
the 55,809 Packer die-hards in attendance ignored the mistakes. At one point, 
they booed their Wisconsin lungs out, causing Majkowski to turn to a teammate 
and say, "Can you believe that . . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Majkowski had heard such jeers. And though he couldn't 
quite blame the fans for sounding off, Majkowski was upset enough to tell 
reporters later that the fans "shouldn't have done that." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, how were they to know Majkowski would live up to his nickname of Majik? 
And who would have guessed that the Packers, 4-12 last season, would record the 
second-best comeback in the franchise's 50-year history? 
</P>
<P>
But it happened, and the Packers, who will play the Rams Sunday at Anaheim 
Stadium, can partly thank Majkowski for the 35-34 victory that had Lambeau 
Field shaking with echoes from the past. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Majkowski put together a string of 18 consecutive completions, 
which tied him with, among others, former Packer Lynn Dickey, who accomplished 
the feat in 1983. Only two other quarterbacks in the National Football League 
have ever done better. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't aware of the streak or record or anything else," he said earlier this 
week from Green Bay. "I was just out there trying to execute well and get some 
points on the board. I just found out (about Dickey's record) after the game, 
basically." 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski also helped provide the Packers with 490 yards of offense, their 
highest output in three years. But to hear Majkowski talk, you would have 
thought that he had little to do with the game's outcome. He credited his 
offensive line and then mentioned how the receivers had run good routes. 
</P>
<P>
And there you have it: the anatomy of one of the most thrilling comebacks in 
Packer annals. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Majkowski reportedly has a bit of a brash streak in him. Selected in 
the 10th round of the 1987 draft, he has gone from no-name to long name to, 
well, the possibilities are varied. Either he has the chance to become 
something special or to join a growing list of undistinguished Packer 
quarterbacks. History isn't on his side. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that a fellow by the name of Bart Starr once wore a Packer 
uniform. All he did was win two straight Super Bowls and create a legacy so 
strong that no one -- not Scott Hunter, Jerry Tagge, John Hadl, Dickey, David 
Whitehurst or, most recently, Randy Wright -- could approach it. 
</P>
<P>
Now along comes Majkowski, who was 2 when Starr dived head-first behind the 
block of Ken Bowman and Jerry Kramer and into the frozen end zone of Lambeau 
Field to beat the Dallas Cowboys in the 1967 NFL championship game. So forgive 
him if he doesn't get caught up in the ongoing nostalgia festival that is 
Packer football. Truth is, he has other things to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Majkowski would like to see a nagging tendinitis problem 
disappear permanently. But it won't, which is why he spends three days a week 
in the weight room, strengthening his throwing shoulder, the same shoulder that 
caused him to miss the team's mini-camps. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't reach 100% until the week before (training) camp started," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was good enough for the Packers, who placed Majkowski as the favorite to 
win the starting job, but made no promises. According to Coach Lindy Infante, 
the position was open to all. But by the end of the third exhibition game, it 
was evident that Majkowski had secured his standing atop the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
The trick was to stay there. Majkowski started nine games in 1988, but found 
himself wondering if a botched play would bring on a replacement. This year, 
Infante took steps to ensure there was no confusion or second quessing. He 
chose Majkowski as the starter and said he would stay there, barring a total 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Don when I gave him the job back a month ago, I said, 'I don't have a 
quick hook. I'm not going to yank you out of the game if you throw an 
interception. And if you have a bad game, I'm not taking the job away from you 
the next week,' " Infante said. 
</P>
<P>
True to his word, Infante kept Majkowski in the lineup, even when the Packers 
fell behind by three touchdowns to the Saints last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got to give Don every opportunity here to express himself and I 
think last week it certainly paid off," he said. "There's no reason to change 
for change's sake. We need to find out how far Don can go." 
</P>
<P>
And how far the Packers can go with him.

Officials said the event would probably not be rescheduled. The tournament 
moves next August, after 10 years at Quail Hollow, to the Tournament Players 
Club at Piper Glen in Charlotte.

The governing body of track and field in the United States will likely 
investigate Darrell Robinson's allegations of drug use by sprinter Florence 
Griffith Joyner and other American athletes, a spokesman for the organization 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be very surprised if there wasn't an investigation," said Pete Cava, 
information director for The Athletics Congress. "What we read (Thursday) is of 
primary importance to us. If it takes a top athlete in the U.S. going down like 
Ben Johnson did in Canada, then so be it." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who retired in February after winning two gold medals at the 
1988 Seoul Olympics, adamantly denied the allegations.

UAL CHIEF TO FORGO YEAR'S PAY; BUYOUT TO NET HIM MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times STaff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UAL Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen M. Wolf, who stands to receive a 
multimillion-dollar windfall as a result of the $6.75-billion employee buyout 
of the parent of United Airlines, agreed Friday to give up his pay for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, who led the buyout group, is giving up his $575,000 salary as "an 
expression of his commitment to employee ownership," said Lawrence M. Nagin, 
United senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf is set to receive a $76-million windfall as a result of the $300-a-share 
buyout. He owns 75,000 shares of UAL and has options to buy another 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nagin said Wolf intends to donate more than $1 million of his profit to an 
educational foundation he will form. 
</P>
<P>
The employee group is composed mainly of United's pilots and members of UAL's 
management. Joined by British Airways, it last week outbid Los Angeles 
billionaire Marvin Davis for the airline. When the transaction is completed, 
United's employees will own 75% of the firm, making it the country's largest 
employee-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
So far, United's pilots union is the only labor group that has agreed to 
participate in the buyout. The airline's flight attendants have been talking 
with United's management about participating but appear far from agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The talks are not going well," Carol Holmes, vice president of the United 
chapter of the Assn. of Flight Attendants, said Friday. "The company has asked 
for severe wage reductions and changes in work rules." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said the value of the proposed concessions exceed the $6 million in 
employee give-backs that were proposed in 1987 but rejected by the union 
membership. The company has refused to comment on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The International Assn. of Machinists, representing mechanics and other ground 
workers, has opposed the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase agreement gives Wolf the right to choose up to 35 members of 
United's management to form a group that will own 10% of the company. British 
Air will own the remaining 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed late Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
indicate that Chief Financial Officer John C. Pope, who stands to receive $37 
million for his stock and options, is part of the management group. They also 
show that Wolf plans to invite Ralph Strangis, a United director involved in 
labor negotiations and the buyout talks, to invest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bass Interest Indicated 
</P>
<P>
UAL's current 12 outside directors, who will leave the company if the buyout is 
completed, will receive $20,000 a year in retirement benefits and unlimited 
travel on the airline, the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the SEC filing, United will lose $450 million in the first two 
years after the buyout but should have enough cash to make more than $1 billion 
in annual debt payments. To meet its projections, United must sell tickets for 
66.7% of the seats on its planes. Over the past five years, it has sold an 
average of 64.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The documents indicate that UAL received an expression of interest in 
purchasing the company from Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass. But when Bass 
representatives met with United's pilots, the pilots said they would rather 
pursue a buyout with United's management.

UNITED JOINS OTHER AIRLINES IN BOOSTING DISCOUNT TICKET PRICES

United Airlines, the second-largest U.S. air carrier, Friday joined the 
industry's move to higher discount fares, virtually assuring that the fares 
will not be rolled back. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Airlines also raised prices Friday to the level set Wednesday by 
American Airlines, the No. 1 U.S. carrier, and joined Thursday by Delta Air 
Lines, Continental Airlines, Pan American World Airways and Trans World 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
USAir and Northwest Airlines were still holding out against the fare increases 
late Friday but were considered certain to match the industry's new price 
level. 
</P>
<P>
United said it had raised its prices on nonrefundable 14-day advance purchase 
tickets by an average of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Steeper increases were imposed on the seven-day advance purchase ticket 
category, and penalties for canceling them were doubled. 
</P>
<P>
When one airline raises or lowers fares, competitors usually decide quickly 
whether to match the new price structure. If they decide not to change, the 
competitive pressure often forces the leader to pull back. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, with most of the major airlines having said their fares will 
rise next Friday, it will be up to the traveling public to determine whether 
the higher fares remain in force. 
</P>
<P>
"The big boys are all on board now (and) . . . it appears that the higher fares 
will stick," said Hans J. Plickert, an airline analyst with the Transportation 
Group, an affiliate of New York-based Paine Webber investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Makes Economic Sense' 
</P>
<P>
"But it now all depends on how the airlines read the tea leaves. It depends on 
what kind of reservation patterns they see for the next couple of weeks," 
Plickert said. "Who knows? In two or three weeks they might institute some new 
promotional fares or rescind the hikes." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said, "It appears that the adjustment makes 
economic sense at this time." Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings since March 9, and its pilots, flight attendants and machinists 
have been on strike since March 4. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest and USAir both said that they would continue to study their options 
until next week.

P&amp;G TO ACQUIRE NOXELL CORP. IN $1.3-BILLION DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
TAX-FREE TRANSACTION WILL INVOLVE STOCK SWAP WITH COSMETICS MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer products powerhouse Procter &amp; Gamble Co. will acquire Noxell 
Corp., maker of skin-care goods and cosmetics, in a stock-swap deal valued at 
$1.3 billion, both companies announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of a definitive agreement approved by the boards of both companies, 
P&amp;G will add Noxell's Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines and Noxzema skin 
cream to its already bulging portfolio of leading consumer products and foods. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement sent Noxell soaring $10 to $31.25 a share in over-the-counter 
trading. On the New York Stock Exchange, P&amp;G lost $2 a share to $119.86. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement, P&amp;G will exchange 0.272 shares of its common 
stock for each of Noxell's 40.5 million common and class B shares in a tax-free 
transaction. Based on the closing price for P&amp;G, the transaction would have 
a value of $32.60 per Noxell share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Very Competitive Market 
</P>
<P>
Noxell, based in Hunt Valley, Md., will be operated as a P&amp;G unit. The 
75-year-old company has 2,200 employees and annual revenue of roughly $522 
million from sales in the United States, Canada and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts applauded the surprise announcement as strategically sound and said 
the acquisition launches P&amp;G into the rough-and-tumble world of women's 
makeup. Although P&amp;G has a number of successful skin care products, 
including Oil of Olay, Bain de Soleil and Clearasil, it has no cosmetics lines. 
</P>
<P>
"P&amp;G has done a lot of work in skin care technology . . . and this will add 
another leg to their delivery systems," said Jay Freedman of Kidder, Peabody 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
He said Cover Girl is the No. 1 mass-market cosmetics line in the United 
States, and for that P&amp;G paid a premium. Freedman said the price offered 
for Noxell is about 15 times operating cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Noxell, which also makes Lestoil household cleaner, was attracted 
by P&amp;G's resources for research and development. Last year P&amp;G spent 
more than $650 million on research and product development.

CHRYSLER SELLS OFF ALMOST HALF OF ITS STAKE IN MITSUBISHI

Chrysler Corp. said Friday that it cashed in nearly half its stake in Japan's 
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. for $592 million, but industry analysts said the 
business ties between the two auto giants were unlikely to change much. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler sold 75 million of its 168.9 million shares of MMC to Japanese 
financial institutions, which already owned some of the Japanese auto maker's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
The sale reduced Chrysler's stake in MMC to 12.1% from 21.8% of the outstanding 
shares. But Chrysler remains the second-largest shareholder after Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries, which has 28.4%, a spokesman for Mitsubishi Motors in Tokyo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler first invested in Mitsubishi in 1971 and has gradually expanded the 
ties between the two companies, from distribution to joint work on product 
development, component purchases and, most recently, manufacturing with 
Diamond-Star Motors, a joint venture, in Normal, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weakening Domestic Market 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said the sale amounted to about 45% of its shares and resulted in a 
net profit of $310 million, or $1.33 for each share of Chrysler stock. On 
Friday, Chrysler stock closed 25 cents higher at $25.50 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Chrysler needed the funds to cope with a weakening 
domestic market and shrinking profits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it means that Chrysler needs the money," said Steve Usher at Kleinwort 
Benson International Inc. "I don't think there's much more to it." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Phillippi at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Chrysler could use the 
cash infusion to bolster its ambitious plan to spend $15 billion on product 
development over five years. "Chrysler must aggressively invest in its 
infrastructure" to remain competitive, he said.

ERLY TO SELL SOME UNITS, FOCUS ON JUICE AND RICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddled with debt from an aggressive acquisition drive, Erly Industries Inc., 
the Los Angeles-based conglomerate that owns Comet Rice, will sell its less 
profitable divisions and concentrate on its core businesses of juice and rice, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Erly's problems began in 1988. A year earlier, the company loaned $24 million 
to struggling Hansen Foods to help the natural soft-drink maker restructure its 
business. In return, Erly was to receive 50% of Hansen's profits. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1988, Hansen defaulted on the Erly loan and subsequently filed for 
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Erly had borrowed 
$12 million to make the loan to Hansen and was left having to pay off its own 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Hansen debacle, Erly went on to acquire Kraft Inc.'s citrus 
business, the troubled TreeSweet companies and a 48% interest in Houston-based 
American Rice -- all within 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working on Hansen Deal 
</P>
<P>
"The financing for the acquisitions have added to the cash pressures," Gerard 
P. Thomas, Erly's vice president and chief financial officer, said Friday. "We 
are now looking at a restructuring that would call for the sale of our 
Chemonics fire retardant business and international agribusiness consulting 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas would not identify Chemonics' buyer, but he said Erly will get $10 
million for the Phoenix-based unit and will retain a 15% interest. 
</P>
<P>
Erly is also involved in negotiations to complete the sale of Hansen Foods, 
which was authorized by the bankruptcy court. If Hansen is successfully sold, 
Erly will receive $13 million and an $11-million note payable over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also working toward selling its wine business or merging it with 
another firm. In addition, a merger between Comet Rice and American Rice is in 
the works, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"While facing hard decisions which result in substantial reserves and charges 
to operations is never easy, we believe that Erly is well positioned to 
capitalize on opportunities in the rice and juice businesses," said Gerald D. 
Murphy, president and chairman of Erly. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Murphy said, "the restructure program will improve our financial 
ability to accomplish this." 
</P>
<P>
Erly Industries Inc. reported sales of $283.3 million for the year ending March 
31, up from $174.3 million for fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1989, the company posted a loss of $13.9 million, compared to a loss 
of $8.6 million for fiscal 1988. The 1989 figure includes a $148-million loss 
from discontinued operations, while the 1988 figure a $10.4-million loss from 
discontinued operations.

CHRISTIE'S TO AUCTION RARE WINES AT BEL AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wine collectors who have long awaited that odd bottle of 1864 Chateau Lafite 
will have a chance to bid on one today at the Bel Age Hotel during the first 
commercial wine sale to be conducted on the West Coast by Christie's, the 
London auction house. 
</P>
<P>
The bottle, filled four years before the Bordeaux estate was bought by the 
Rothschild family, was opened, sampled and recorked at the winery last May, 
according to the auction catalogue, and the cellar master "attested to its fine 
condition, remarking on its youthful fruit, excellent balance and lack of 
browning" -- a common sign of vinous senility. 
</P>
<P>
According to Christie's marketing research, such a bottle would be snapped up 
at $5,000 but could fetch $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to sell for up to $15,000 is an oversize bottle of 1924 Chateau 
Mouton-Rothschild -- actually eight regular bottles, or six liters of wine, 
corked into a single behemoth of a bottle that the Bordelais call Imperial. The 
broad glass front and claret colored background provided a striking and 
expansive setting for Jacques Carlu, a noted Paris architect and stage designer 
of the day, to mount his specially commissioned label. Combining a stylized 
ram's head (mouton meaning sheep), a wine barrel and five arrows representing 
the Rothschild brothers, the label was said to have stunned Bordeaux wine 
merchants who feared losing marketing control if other vintners sought to 
distinguish their estate-bottled products -- which they surely did. 
</P>
<P>
The auction, to be conducted by Michael Broadbent of Christie's in London, will 
offer a range of vintages from another famous Bordeaux estate, Chateau Petrus, 
including magnums, or double-bottles, from 1945, 1947 and 1961. 
</P>
<P>
A number of older Napa Valley wines are also going on the block, including 
Beaulieu Vineyards "private reserve" bottlings from 1951, 1958 and 1968. A wide 
range of wines have been drawn from the cellar of who Christie's described as 
"a prominent Los Angeles collector." These include 11 vintages of both 
Romanee-Conti in Burgundy and Chateau Petrus, not to mention 19 vintages of 
Chateau d'Yquem, a straw-colored dessert wine from the Bordeaux village of 
Sauternes, including what Christie's called "the legendary" 1921 vintage and a 
single bottle of the 1811 -- "probably the most renowned vintage of the 19th 
Century, indeed arguably of all time" -- priced at about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the auction will include property drawn from more than 30 private 
collections, offered in two lots starting at 11 a.m. and at 2:15 p.m. at the 
Bel Age in West Hollywood.

Checchi Gets Report on Northwest: Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner 
told Alfred A. Checchi, the new owner of Northwest Airlines, the result of an 
investigation into the airline's financial health. The results will not be made 
public until next week. Joined by Australian brewer Elders IXL and KLM Royal 
Dutch Airlines, Checchi bought Northwest three months ago for $4.05 billion, 
including $3.1 billion in debt. Skinner is concerned about foreign ownership 
and the safety of airlines involved in debt-financed takeovers.

PACIFIC TELESIS ADOPTS POISON PILL TO WARD OFF HOSTILE BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Directors of Pacific Telesis Group, the parent of Pacific Bell, adopted a 
"share-owners rights plan" on Friday designed to ward off hostile attempts to 
take control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The board also declared its anticipated third-quarter dividend of 47 cents a 
share, which will be paid Nov. 1 to owners of record as of Oct. 10. Dividend 
checks will be accompanied by a detailed description of the so-called 
poison-pill defense plan, said the company's chairman and chief executive, Sam 
Ginn. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the intent of the plan to prevent an offer for Pacific Telesis that 
is well financed and in the interest of our shareholders," Ginn said. "The plan 
is intended to prevent coercive takeover tactics and to encourage potential 
buyers to negotiate directly with the board of directors." 
</P>
<P>
The plan grants share-owners one "right" for each share of common stock that 
they hold as of Oct. 10. These rights will enable all share-owners, except a 
designated hostile bidder, to buy additional shares of stock at half the 
prevailing price. This will boost the cost of any takeover. The plan would be 
triggered if an unwanted bidder bought 20% or more of Pacific Telesis stock, or 
if directors designated as "adverse" any bidder owning at least a 10% stake.

The stock market closed out a listless week with a small gain in light trading 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 1.33 to 2,681.61, finishing the week 
with a net gain of 7.03 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 747 up, 654 down and 562 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 133.35 million shares, down from 146.93 million in the 
previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, 
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
over-the-counter market, totaled 159.37 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said nothing had occurred to stir the market out of its recent torpor. 
</P>
<P>
The rally that carried prices to record highs just before the Labor Day weekend 
crested as it became evident that interest rates had stopped falling. 
</P>
<P>
That left investors in something of a stalemate between those who expect 
persistent economic growth at a moderate pace and those who still believe a 
significant slowdown awaits in the not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
%Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished slightly lower in light dealings as traders were wary of 
making big commitments in advance of this weekend's meeting of major 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 1/16 point, or 63 cents for every 
$1,000 face amount, as its yield rose to 8.19% from 8.18% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were unchanged to down 1/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/8 point and 
long-term issues dropped as much as 5/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., the 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 0.68 to 1,174.66. 
</P>
<P>
% Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.01% as the discount lost 6 
basis points to 7.74%. Yields on six-month bills held steady at 8.15% as the 
discount was firm at 7.74%. Yields on one-year bills issued at auction Thursday 
rose to 8.21% as the discount gained 4 basis points to 7.64%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.9375%, unchanged from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose in thin, erratic trading. Gold prices also rose. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve sold dollars for a fourth straight day, dealers said, but 
the currency bounced back from the intervention and ended near the highs of the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.00 Japanese yen, unchanged from Thursday. In 
London late Friday, the dollar traded higher at 145.35 yen. At the end of the 
day in New York, the dollar rose to 146.05 yen from 145.65 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.5755 late Friday, cheaper for buyers than 
Thursday's late $1.5805. In New York, the pound fell against the dollar to 
$1.5715 from $1.5790. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices were higher in active trading. The late London gold price was 
$364.50 bid an ounce, up from $363.25 late Thursday. The Zurich, Switzerland, 
late bid price was $365.50, up from $363.50. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $364.15 bid, up from $363.85. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures prices rose sharply for a third straight day on New York's 
Commodity Exchange but analysts were divided on whether the market could 
sustain the technically inspired rally. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, gold futures also rose; energy, coffee, grain and soybean 
futures retreated, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures settled 10.5 to 11 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in September at $5.286 an ounce. That price reflects a gain of more than 23.1 
cents in three days. The more actively traded December contract finished at 
$5.38 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled 30 to 70 cents higher, with October at $366.70 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Most energy futures ended lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, although 
the October gasoline contract advanced slightly amid speculation about the 
extent of damage caused by Hurricane Hugo to an Amerada Hess Corp. refinery on 
the Caribbean island of St. Croix. 
</P>
<P>
Other energy contracts retreated on profit taking after rallying sharply on 
hurricane-related fears earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as 
hopes for a restoration of coffee export quotas faded. 
</P>
<P>
The International Coffee Organization opens a two-week meeting Monday in London 
but most experts do not expect the 74 nation-members to agree on new 
price-support measures.

SECURITY PACIFIC TO RELOCATE MERGED CREDIT-CARD UNITS 
</P>

Security Pacific Corp. said Friday that it will combine its three credit-card 
processing facilities, including one in Glendale, and move them to a new site 
in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale credit-card operation is the largest of the Los Angeles banking 
company's three centers, employing 420 people. Security Pacific has another in 
Seattle, which employs 200 people. The smallest one employs 61 people in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
A Security Pacific spokeswoman said all of the current employees will be 
offered jobs at the Phoenix center. She added that an effort will be made to 
find jobs elsewhere in the company for Glendale and Seattle employees who 
choose not to move. If other jobs cannot be found, she said, employees will 
receive severance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The credit-card facilities operate 24 hours a day, processing transactions for 
purchases made with MasterCard and Visa credit cards issued by Security 
Pacific. The three facilities combined handle 1.5 million accounts with total 
balances of more than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific, parent of Security Pacific National Bank, disclosed in April 
that it was considering combining the three facilities into one as a major 
cost-saving measure. Security Pacific now has three centers because it acquired 
banks in Arizona and Washington that had their own processing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Start by Year-End 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific said it also considered sites in California, Oregon, Nevada 
and Washington. It said Arizona was selected because workers are plentiful, 
operating costs are expected to be lower and because various laws and 
regulations there are less strict than in some other states, such as 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The banking company said it expects to start consolidating the facilities by 
the end of the year.

10 KILLED, 22 HURT BY IRA BOMB AT ENGLAND BARRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday 
that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England 
to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously. It would be one 
of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island. 
</P>
<P>
Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged 
dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away. The musicians were 
between the ages of 16 and 20 as are most of the recruits in the school. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with 
certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb. But he said the 
characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared 
to confirm that it was the work of the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA "active service" 
units, each composed of four or five members, are operating in Britain and 
continental Europe. 
</P>
<P>
One member, known as the "Jackal" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth 
novel "The Day of the Jackal," has been eluding the authorities for two years. 
He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last 
successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in 
August, 1988. One soldier was killed in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehy and another wanted Irishman, John Conaghty, were linked to an IRA bomb 
factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in 
pursuit of a car thief. A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons, 
ammunition, 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a "hit list" of 100 British 
political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's explosion occurred about 8:30 a.m. in a lounge at the Royal Marines 
School of Music near Deal, on the English Channel in the county of Kent. At the 
school are about 250 recruits who receive military and musical training before 
joining Royal Marines bands. 
</P>
<P>
The roof of the three-story barracks collapsed, trapping victims beneath the 
rubble. Firefighters used thermal cameras and dogs to search the debris for 
victims and survivors. Heavy lifting gear was brought to the scene from a 
nearby site where a tunnel is being built beneath the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers shouted for quiet as they used high-technology listening equipment in 
an effort to trace the sound of faint heartbeats. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode," Heather 
Hackett, a 26-year-old Deal housewife, told the British Press Assn. She said 
she told her children to run for cover, but as they did, her kitchen window 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole window was blown across the kitchen," Hackett recalled. Her 
2-year-old son, Joshua, was hit by a shard that embedded itself in his back but 
caused no serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I just screamed and ran out of the room," she said. "The bang was so loud I 
thought the whole house was coming in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appalling Outrage' 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Tom King visited the scene and called the bombing "an 
appalling outrage committed against unarmed bandsmen -- people who worked for 
charity, who have given great enjoyment to millions right across the country, 
right across the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The real evil of these murders is that the people who commit them, the 
'godfathers' who send them to commit them, know that they will actually achieve 
nothing. Terrorism is not going to win. We shall find the people responsible 
for this outrage sooner or later, as we have already found some of those 
responsible for the earlier outrages, and they will be brought to justice." 
</P>
<P>
The authorities have been on high alert, expecting IRA attacks in connection 
with last month's 20th anniversary of the introduction of British troops into 
Northern Ireland. The republican underground organization opposes British rule 
in the predominantly Protestant province and is fighting to join the mainly 
Roman Catholic south in a united, independent Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visit to Ulster 
</P>
<P>
But in a statement telephoned to a Dublin news agency, Ireland International, 
Friday's attack was linked to Thatcher's visit last week to units of the 
controversial Ulster Defense Regiment in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The locally recruited, overwhelmingly Protestant Ulster Defense Regiment has 
come under fire in connection with an investigation into the leak of secret 
government lists of suspected IRA members to Protestant assassination squads. 
It is widely hated by the Catholic minority in the province, and the Irish 
government in Dublin has urged Britain to disband the force. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Thatcher visited Ireland with a message of war at a time when we want 
peace," the statement claiming responsibility for the Deal attack said. "Now in 
turn we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent. But we still want peace, and we 
want the British government to leave our country." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed "P. O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau," a 
signature that has appeared on earlier IRA bombing claims. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's attack was the worst on the mainland since the virtually simultaneous 
bombings of July, 1982, directed at ceremonial military units in London's Hyde 
Park and Regent's Park. Eleven bandsmen and mounted guards were killed in those 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Eight persons were killed by IRA car bombs outside Harrods department store 
here in December, 1983, and 21 were killed and 162 injured in two Birmingham 
public house bombings in the fall of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
An attempted barracks bombing was averted last February when a sentry came upon 
two intruders who had managed to get inside a military camp in Shropshire. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a series of bomb and automatic rifle attacks this year on 
British soldiers and their families stationed in West Germany. Earlier this 
month an IRA gunman shot to death an army wife, Heidi Hazell, 25, in her car 
near her home at Dortmund.

SOVIETS REMOVE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO ARMS TREATY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in a concession that appeared 
to remove the single most important obstacle to the conclusion of a strategic 
arms reduction treaty, said Friday that the Soviet Union has dropped its demand 
that the pact be contingent on limiting U.S. efforts to develop new 
anti-missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the Soviet concession represented "a 
positive development" in negotiations toward a treaty that would cut the 
nuclear offensive arsenals of the superpowers about 50%, a senior U.S. aide 
said. But American officials are still seeking clarification of the new Soviet 
position, which they disclosed in a briefing to reporters during two days of 
talks here. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also eased their demand that a START treaty include limits on 
sea-launched cruise missiles, although the key difficulty of verifying limits 
on these weapons remained unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Pressure Seen 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected Soviet moves appeared certain to increase pressure on the Bush 
Administration to respond with comparable concessions. That may well lead the 
White House, in turn, to bring new pressure on Congress to make decisions on 
the defense budget that would permit the United States to change its 
negotiating stance in the START talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has already come under fire from Democratic leaders and some 
arms control experts, who have accused Bush of being timid in his response to 
the initiatives of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The START negotiations, under way since 1984, have been described as 80% to 90% 
completed during the Ronald Reagan Administration, and Bush aides have 
expressed hope that the treaty might be finished by the end of 1990. That 
timetable will probably be accelerated by the new developments, although 
important differences on mobile missiles and overall verification differences 
remain to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet moves, which reverse longstanding insistence that the United States 
curb missile defense efforts such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, known as 
"Star Wars," were described with some ambiguity in a nine-page letter from 
Gorbachev to Bush on a range of arms control initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, at the meetings with Shevardnadze here following delivery of the letter, 
asked the Soviet official directly whether the tie between missile defenses and 
a START offensive weapon agreement had now been dropped. Shevardnadze's 
assurance that it had been dropped led a senior U.S. official to read the 
following statement: 
</P>
<P>
"They have dropped their linkage between completing and implementing an 
agreement with START and achieving a defense and space accord, including 
questions dealing with the ABM treaty." 
</P>
<P>
Another senior official, asked whether the Soviets had provided any more 
detailed description of their new position or its rationale, shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 severely curtails missile defenses on 
both sides. The amount of research, development and testing of new types of 
missile-defense devices, such as space-based exotic beam weapons, has been a 
source of bitter dispute between the United States and Soviet Union since the 
START talks began. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Continued Commitment' 
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official added that "we have made clear the President's 
continued commitment to the Strategic Defense Initative," an assurance to the 
conservative supporters of "Star Wars" that Bush has not deserted the program. 
Congress has consistently cut Administration requests for SDI funding, however, 
and the Administration itself has scaled back the program's goal from Reagan's 
original, grandiose vision of a leakproof nationwide shield against missile 
attack to a more limited system that would guard against accidental launches -- 
and that not until the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also offered two more concessions which also appeared aimed at 
breaking the remaining logjams in the START talks. 
</P>
<P>
One was the proposal that limits on sea-launched cruise missiles, which Moscow 
has sought as part of a START treaty, could be part of a separate agreement. 
But a senior Soviet official said his government still wants to see those 
missiles cut at the same time a START pact is signed. And a senior U.S. 
official warned that the Bush Administration still believes that limits on 
sea-launched cruise missiles would be virtually impossible to verify. 
</P>
<P>
In another apparent concession, Soviet officials said they had also softened 
their objection to testing of weapons to defend against nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor P. Karpov told reporters that his country 
was willing to agree to "some testing of devices in space," and suggested that 
the two sides agree to a list of permissible tests. U.S. officials, who have 
long asserted a right to test exotic beam devices in space under the ABM 
Treaty, said they were willing to consider the Soviet approach. 
</P>
<P>
That issue, too, had long posed an obstacle to the conclusion of a START 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev's letter spelled out some of these moves and hinted at 
others, U.S. officials appeared surprised by the breadth of the Soviet 
concessions. Asked for their assessment of Gorbachev's motives, several senior 
officials said simply, "Ask the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
The conciliatory Soviet moves, moreover, came amid sharp disagreements between 
Baker and Shevardnadze over Afghanistan, Nicaragua, and human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
The two diplomats, meeting in a luxurious lodge beneath the snow-topped crags 
of the Teton mountains, spent almost two hours of an intense one-on-one session 
sparring over their policies on the Third World conflicts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men became so absorbed in the argument that their meeting ran more than 
an hour overtime, leaving dozens of senior aides waiting in lobbies and 
hallways. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials have often pointed to Soviet behavior in the 
Third World as a key test of whether the "new thinking" proclaimed by Gorbachev 
has any real impact on the Kremlin's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
According to a senior aide, Baker told Shevardnadze bluntly, "that when we take 
a look at some of the patterns of Soviet involvement (in the Third World) . . . 
there is, from our standpoint, a disturbing flow of arms." 
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. intelligence reports have detected "a surge of arms" to pro-Soviet 
regimes in Cambodia and Ethiopia, "a tremendous increase" in weapons shipments 
to the pro-Moscow government in Afghanistan, and a continued flow of weaponry 
from the Soviet Bloc to the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't seem to fit our understanding of what 'new thinking' is supposed 
to embody," he quoted Baker as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze rejected the criticism and accused the United States of acting 
irresponsibly by continuing its military aid to Muslim rebels in Afghanistan, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the United States is violating its obligation as a guarantor of 
the Geneva accords (reached in 1988 to end the Afghan war)," a senior Soviet 
official said, pointing to continued U.S. arms shipments to the rebels. That 
agreement calls for an end to foreign aid to the rebels, but the Bush 
Administration has said that it will continue sending supplies as long as 
Moscow continues active support to the Kabul regime. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Nicaragua, Shevardnadze annoyed U.S. officials by sticking to 
his position that the Kremlin has stopped sending arms directly to the 
Sandinistas but is powerless to stop its allies like Cuba from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
There were also sharp words over human rights, with Shevardnadze countering a 
U.S. list of Soviet citizens who have been refused the right to emigrate with a 
Kremlin compiled list of 40 alleged "political prisoners" in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Baker-Shevardnadze arguments, as recounted by their aides, sounded like a 
return to the bad old days of U.S.-Soviet polemics before Gorbachev came to 
power. But officials on both sides took pains to stress that the dispute did 
not poison the two countries' discussions on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a discussion that was carried on in a way that suggested that these two 
men have established a working relationship" in which both sides "have to be 
honest and candid," a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials said they were neither surprised nor upset by the U.S. 
criticism, but they also appeared anxious to turn the meeting's attention 
toward arms control, the subject the Kremlin wants to keep at the center of the 
superpower agenda. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the major Soviet concessions, the two sides moved toward 
conclusion of several technical agreements on arms control. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they expect to sign today an agreement on "trial verification" 
to formalize a surprisingly fast acceptance by the two countries of a new 
principle in arms control talks: that experiments to test the feasibility of 
systems to verify the size and location of nuclear weapons can be conducted 
even before a treaty to reduce them is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration proposed the idea in June, but Soviet officials 
insisted that the agreement to be signed today was devised by their experts in 
Moscow. The pact is a general agreement by both sides to begin working on ways 
to begin mutual verification of each others' arsenals, a key part of any arms 
reduction effort. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze are also expected to sign an agreement to exchange 
information before any major test or exercise of strategic nuclear forces, a 
Soviet official said. 
</P>
<P>
They may also sign an agreement to swap information about the size and location 
of each others' chemical weapons, a step toward reducing those arsenals, 
officials said -- although some officials said last-minute snags could delay 
that pact. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze met here, at a resort built by the late John D. 
Rockefeller III, as part of an agreement to begin varying their twice-yearly 
meetings beyond Washington and Moscow.

FAA SUSPENDS LICENSES OF PILOTS IN USAIR CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
CAPTAIN SAYS INEXPERIENCED CO-PILOT DISENGAGED THROTTLE; IMPROPER PROCEDURES 
CITED BY NTSB

<P>
Amid reports of aberrant and inept behavior by the cockpit crew, federal 
officials on Friday suspended the licenses of the captain and co-pilot of a 
USAir jetliner that crashed during an aborted takeoff attempt at La Guardia 
Airport on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration said that because of "circumstances related 
to the accident . . . (Capt. Michael Martin and First Officer Constantine 
Kleissas) no longer qualify to exercise their privileges to fly an airliner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subpoenas Issued 
</P>
<P>
The agency said also that it has issued subpoenas for Martin, a veteran pilot, 
and Kleissas, who was at the controls for the first time on a regularly 
scheduled 737 flight. The FAA said it is asking them to "provide all pertinent 
records" involving Wednesday's crash. The plane broke into three pieces after 
skidding into the East River, killing two women passengers. 
</P>
<P>
At a briefing Friday night, James L. Kolstad, acting chairman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, said that "there clearly was a lack of proper 
procedure being followed in the cockpit" of USAir Flight 5050. 
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews with NTSB investigators Friday, each pilot cast doubt on 
the other's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, the investigators said, described Kleissas as inexperienced and said 
Kleissas inadvertently disengaged the automatic throttle control mechanism as 
the plane began its takeoff roll. Martin said he manually engaged the throttle 
but then felt "a vibration" and detected a leftward drift of the plane. When he 
could not control the drift with the rudder, he aborted the flight, Martin told 
the NTSB. Too late, he realized that the plane would skid into the river. 
</P>
<P>
Kleissas told investigators that, after the crash, he had mentioned to others 
that Martin was "babbling" while going over the preflight checklist, but the 
co-pilot said he now regrets using that word. 
</P>
<P>
Unnamed New York Port Authority detectives have been quoted in New York 
newspapers as saying that Kleissas told them that Martin had been "mumbling" 
and "acting irrationally" before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Kleissas, a resident of the San Fernando Valley, was also quoted as saying the 
pilot began screaming shortly after giving the command to abort the takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said Friday that "it clearly took too long" for Martin and Kleissas to 
report for drug and alcohol testing after the crash. The results of the tests 
were not made public Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has a right to know that its transportation system is alcohol- and 
drug-free," Kolstad said. "Failure to promptly volunteer for alcohol and drug 
testing following a major accident is inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
"The provision of urine samples, and no blood samples, almost two days after 
this accident severely impedes our investigation and unnecessarily creates an 
environment of suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Highly Questionable' 
</P>
<P>
In a statement from Washington, FAA Administrator James B. Busey said that, 
"for these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36 hours after an 
accident that took two lives and to do so with no explanation is highly 
questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials in New York said the captain's flight bag had been 
impounded and searched but "nothing improper" was found. However, the Queens 
district attorney's office said it was continuing to monitor the federal 
investigation of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said that Martin and Kleissas said that they had assisted passengers in 
evacuating the plane before leaving the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
The senior flight attendant on the plane, at an emotional news conference with 
three of his co-workers from Flight 5050, said both pilots assisted in rescue 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But the attendant, Wayne Reed, 34, of Chesapeake, Va., refused to comment on 
the captain's behavior except to say: "He was assisting me in any way he 
could." 
</P>
<P>
The captain told investigators that he took a rescue boat to a nearby pier and 
then went to a hotel, where he met with representatives of the Air Line Pilots 
Assn., the pilots' union. 
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot said a Coast Guard helicopter took him to a Port Authority 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said the two men told the NTSB that "they'd gone through a very 
traumatic experience. They'd helped the passengers. They wanted to leave." 
</P>
<P>
The pilots' union said Friday that "there was nothing unusual in the crew's 
performance; no federal rules were broken, and the crew has cooperated 
completely with the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The union denied also that Martin disappeared after the crash. A USAir 
representative contacted Martin after the crash and told him to check into a 
Marriott hotel and stay there, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was unable to obtain a room at the Marriott, he went to the home of 
another pilot to rest and recuperate," the union's statement said. "There he 
remained in contact with the company, which knew his whereabouts at all times." 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB said the cockpit crew's day began in Baltimore at 2:10 p.m., when the 
pair were scheduled to fly to La Guardia. Because of delays, the flight did not 
leave until 7:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said the captain told investigators that Kleissas piloted the plane on 
the flight to La Guardia and his performance "suggested that he was obviously 
new . . . he missed some radio calls, radio checks." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot said that, when Flight 5050 prepared to leave La Guardia for 
Charlotte, N.C., later that night, Kleissas was at the controls. It was the 
first time Kleissas had piloted a Boeing 737-400 on takeoff on a regularly 
scheduled flight. 
</P>
<P>
David Shipley, a spokesman for the airline, said in response to questions being 
raised about Martin's piloting skills that the captain was "very experienced" 
at flying a Boeing 737A and that there was nothing negative in his record with 
USAir or with Piedmont Airlines, which merged with USAir earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB said Martin has about 2,500 hours of experience in a 737. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Kleissas had only training in the Boeing 737, although Shipley 
said he was fully qualified to handle the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"All (our) pilots go through a training program," Shipley said. "No pilot is 
out there flying a plane with passengers in the back who has never flown that 
plane before." 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said it had not been determined whether Kleissas' inexperience 
contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, neither pilot followed proper procedure in calling out Flight 
5050's speed as it accelerated down the runway, Kolstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking off, a cockpit crew normally calculates the plane's "V-1" speed. 
V-1 is the so-called point of no return, the speed at which the plane is going 
too fast, and is too far down the runway, to abort the takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
V-1 on a given plane varies according to a number of factors, including load 
and runway length. According to the NTSB, the V-1 for Flight 5050 on Wednesday 
was 121 knots. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, the cockpit crew member not manning the controls on 
takeoff calls out "V-1" when the plane reaches V-1 speed, "V-R" when the plane 
reaches the speed to rotate into a nose-high attitude for liftoff and "V-2" 
when it reaches the speed at which it can safely climb out on one of its two 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation sources say there are a number of reasons why the abort attempt might 
have failed, including miscalculation of the V-1 speed, an inordinate delay 
before the abort attempt was initiated, brake failure and failure of the thrust 
reversers, which can be deployed to help slow the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers did report seeing plumes of spray, apparently 
indicating that the thrust reversers were deployed during the abort attempt.

<TEXT>
<P>
The defense minister said Friday that Cambodian government troops can defend 
the country against a guerrilla coalition, despite a surge in nearby fighting 
that has accompanied the withdrawal of Vietnamese soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Tea Banh spoke at a farewell ceremony for departing soldiers 
on the second day of the withdrawal of the last Vietnamese troops. Vietnam has 
promised to have all of its 26,000 troops out of Cambodia by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese troops invaded in December, 1978, to oust the Khmer Rouge, which is 
blamed for the deaths of a million Cambodians by execution, disease and 
starvation during its rule from 1975 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge is the strongest in the three-party guerrilla coalition 
fighting the government installed by Vietnam. Many analysts say Cambodia's 
army, estimated at 50,000, is poorly trained and led and could have problems 
fighting the guerrillas alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle May Test Troops 
</P>
<P>
In Battambang province in western Cambodia, government and rebel forces were 
engaged in what could be a major battlefield test of government troops without 
the support of experienced Vietnamese forces. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ke Kim Yan said Friday that as many as 450 Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas were shelling the Pailin area of Battambang province, 12 miles from 
the Thai-Cambodian border, with up to 2,000 mortar rounds per day. The 
guerrillas maintain bases along the Thai-Cambodian border. 
</P>
<P>
"We are mobilizing all our men so we will not lose Pailin," Ke Kim Yan said in 
an interview with reporters in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
Pailin's forests and mountains could provide good hiding places for the 
guerrillas, while gem mines in the area could help bankroll the opposition 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
"If they get Pailin, it is not only a gain toward their military strategy, but 
is also a gain for their economic strategy," Ke Kim Yan said. "Already the 
Khmer Rouge are making money to support their battle from nearby mines rich in 
rubies and amethysts." 
</P>
<P>
He said the capture of Pailin would allow the Khmer Rouge to move troops and 
supplies more easily into the Cambodian interior, and the fall of the district 
capital, held by the government for the past 10 years, would be a major 
psychological victory for the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"If we give up territory, it will show the enemy is superior to our side," he 
said.

<P>
Lebanon's Christian army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, on Friday accepted a 
seven-point Arab League truce plan aimed at ending six months of savage 
shelling between his forces and Syrian troops that has claimed more than 800 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to intense international pressure to agree to a truce, Aoun, who 
launched a war to drive about 40,000 Syrian troops out of Lebanon in March, 
shifted his rhetoric of war to one of peace. 
</P>
<P>
"We declare to our people, all our people in the liberated as well as the 
(Syrian-) occupied areas, that Sept. 23 is the beginning of the chance to 
achieve peace," the grim-faced general said in a two-minute address broadcast 
on national television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, which controls 70% of Lebanon, and its Lebanese allies accepted the Arab 
League plan, which calls for an immediate cease-fire, soon after it was 
announced last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, wearing his usual army fatigues, said he agreed to the plan after 
"appeals from the international community, all the Arabs and all the friends, 
and in line with the Lebanese people's desire." 
</P>
<P>
Several previous cease-fires called by the Arab League have failed to end this 
latest round of fighting in the 14-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The population of Beirut appeared to take the call for peace seriously. In 
Syrian-controlled Muslim West Beirut, gunmen fired in the air in a traditional 
expression of joy. East Beirut was silent but most exhausted residents said 
they were relieved. Still other residents drove through the battle-torn streets 
honking their car horns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Washington Optimistic 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said, "We hope 
that this will result quickly in a cease-fire by all the parties to the 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun conveyed his acceptance of the plan to Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi 
during the third round of talks this week in his bunker-office under the 
bomb-ravaged presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
After the 40-minute meeting, Aoun told reporters: "We wish success to the peace 
plan. We've given peace a chance and, God willing, there will be peace. The 
results will be positive if the intentions are sincere. If not, we reserve the 
right to take proper decisions at the proper time." 
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi, assistant secretary general of the 22-member Arab League, said after 
his meeting with Aoun that the Lebanese "as of now, will be able to reopen 
their shops, go to schools and return to their homes." About 90% of Beirut's 
1.5 million people have fled the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi said he would set up a security team to consolidate the peace, as 
proposed in the Arab League plan. 
</P>
<P>
Following Aoun's announcement, Salim Hoss, a Sunni Muslim who heads a 
Syrian-backed government rivaling Aoun's, said, "We are all eager that the 
cease-fire be consolidated and the political process started." 
</P>
<P>
The plan's first six points focus on the cease-fire and steps to enforce it. 
The last clause calls for a meeting of the 99-seat Parliament on Sept. 30, 
outside Lebanon, to discuss political reforms to satisfy Muslim demands for an 
equal share of power with the Christians. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also defers the issue of a Syrian troop withdrawal, but Aoun said that 
Ibrahimi assured him the need for foreign troops to be withdrawn was 
recognized. Syria maintains its troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League 
peacekeeping mandate.

About 25,000 activists of all races marched Friday to protest the policies of 
South Africa's white-led government, and thousands of women planned to defy a 
government ban and hold another rally over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Militant black unions launched a two-week, nationwide consumer boycott of 
white-owned stores and told their 1.5 million members to refuse to work 
overtime for the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders said the no-overtime protest could cut industrial production by 
20% or force white employers to hire thousands of additional black workers. The 
unions are protesting a controversial labor law that was enacted last year 
despite vehement objections from black unions. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the original, hard-line provisions of the Labor Relations Amendment Act 
were modified, but unions still object to sections that prohibit sympathy 
strikes, restrict the frequency of strikes against a particular company, and 
make it easier for unions to be held liable for strike-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
In Durban, South Africa's largest port and third-largest city, an estimated 
15,000 people, including members of the white city council, joined a peaceful 
anti-government march to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Activists raised the green, black and gold banner of the outlawed African 
National Congress guerrilla movement on the flagpole at Durban's City Hall, and 
police allowed it to remain during the rally. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask (President Frederik W.) de Klerk and (Law and Order Minister Adriaan) 
Vlok to come down from their ivory towers and join the people," said Jay 
Naidoo, secretary general of the Congress of South African Trade Unions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 10,000 protesters led by the Rev. Allan Boesak staged a 
similar march in Oudtshoorn, a city of about 40,000 people 300 miles east of 
Cape Town. It was the largest protest ever in Oudtshoorn, center of the 
ostrich-farming industry and the scene of frequent confrontations between 
police and activists. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of anti-apartheid women's groups vowed to ignore a government ban 
and march today on government headquarters in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said the government obtained a court injunction 
to stop the march because organizers did not apply for approval. Two white 
supremacist groups sought and received permission to hold rallies today in 
Pretoria.

The Justice Department refused Friday to seek permission to make an oral 
argument during the Supreme Court's consideration of a Minnesota law 
restricting abortions for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to forgo oral argument appears to signal that the department will 
not use the Minnesota case as the occasion to renew its argument that the 
landmark 1973 abortion-rights decision be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said the Bush Administration still 
has as a legal goal the overturning of that decision, Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Eramian said, however, that "it's premature" to say if the brief that Solicitor 
General Kenneth Starr still plans to file in the Minnesota case will address 
that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Eramian said the department intends to join the attorney general of Minnesota 
in defending the law, which requires teen-agers to obtain the permission of 
parents -- even those not a part of their lives -- to get an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But the Minnesota case may not present the best opportunity for the Justice 
Department to continue its argument that the high court should overturn Roe vs. 
Wade, said a department source who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The solicitor general, often called the 10th justice in legal circles, must be 
careful to preserve his special relationship with the high court by not 
pressing legal arguments that have been freshly rebuffed by the justices, the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
It could be insulting to the justices if the Justice Department quickly returns 
to the Supreme Court to raise the same legal point that the court rejected in 
July when the justices refused to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missouri Case 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department specifically urged the high court to use a Missouri case 
to overturn the 1973 precedent, a request made in oral argument by former 
Solicitor General Charles Fried. 
</P>
<P>
The high court in that case held that the Missouri law did not run afoul of Roe 
vs. Wade, and therefore the 1973 precedent was left intact even though the 
statute prohibited abortions in state facilities or in hospitals on state land. 
</P>
<P>
Because it involves a law restricting the rights of teen-agers, Hodgson vs. 
Minnesota does not deal as squarely as the Missouri case with the fundamental 
issue of a woman's constitutional right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Minnesota attorney general is not seeking to overturn Roe vs. 
Wade in his argument before the court may also be a factor in the Justice 
Department's reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion-rights issue is a politically vexing one for President Bush, who 
has shifted his stance from pro-choice to anti-abortion in the last decade.

CLEANER STATES EXEMPTED IN SENATE ACID RAIN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Clean air advocates in the Senate announced a compromise Friday designed to 
bring Congress one step closer to an agreement on controlling acid rain by 
proposing to exempt states that already have installed equipment to reduce 
power plant emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) 
outlined the agreement at a news conference called to preview legislation they 
plan to introduce next week as part of congressional debate on President Bush's 
clean air bill. 
</P>
<P>
Acid rain is formed when airborne sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are 
transformed into sulfuric and nitric acids. After being carried back to earth 
by rain or snow, the pollutants are associated with destruction of marine life 
and damage to forests and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitchell-Baucus proposal retains the main acid rain provisions of the 
President's bill, which would require public utilities to reduce sulfur dioxide 
emissions from power plants by 10 million tons by the year 2000. Both measures 
propose a subsequent limit on the growth of sulfur dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Bush bill, however, the Mitchell-Baucus measure would exempt states 
that have already installed pollution-control equipment on more than half of 
their coal-fired power plants from the need to make further reductions until 
the year 2000. The affected states are Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, North 
Dakota, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal would also exempt new plants that burn "clean" or 
low-sulfur coal from mandatory installation of expensive pollution control 
devices known as scrubbers. 
</P>
<P>
Both exemptions address concerns raised by Montana and other "clean coal" 
Western states about the added cost that they would bear to help reduce sulfur 
dioxide emissions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Baucus called the agreement "a real breakthrough" that should accelerate 
passage of a clean air bill through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition is still expected from Midwestern states that burn high-sulfur coal 
and that would bear most of the cost of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions. But 
Mitchell, a long-standing advocate of acid rain legislation in the Senate, 
predicted that "some form of cost-sharing" could be negotiated "to accommodate 
the interests of the Midwestern states." 
</P>
<P>
The compromise was hailed by environmentalists, who said a consensus on acid 
rain legislation would remove one of the most contentious issues that has 
blocked passage of clean air legislation in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The prospect of getting strong bipartisan legislation on clean air is greatly 
enhanced by this step," said A. Blakeman Early, a Washington representative of 
the Sierra Club. "It's a major step forward, in our opinion." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush clean air bill, which represents the first comprehensive attempt in 
more than a decade to revise the Clean Air Act of 1970, is undergoing an 
intensive debate on Capitol Hill. Several bills and amendments are being 
proposed by clean air advocates seeking to strengthen the measure, which is 
designed to achieve major reductions in smog, acid rain and toxic air 
pollutants by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists won a test victory in the House on Wednesday, when an Energy 
and Commerce subcommittee voted unanimously to delete a provision from the Bush 
bill that would have allowed auto makers to satisfy tailpipe emission standards 
by averaging the emission levels of all the cars they produced.

SENATE TALKS ON LARGER ANTI-DRUG PLAN COLLAPSE; 
</P>
<P>
HATFIELD BLAMES DEADLOCK ON BYRD, WHO ACCUSES WHITE HOUSE OF MEDDLING

<P>
Weeklong talks between Senate Democrats and Republicans over proposed 
expansions of President Bush's anti-drug initiative broke off abruptly Friday, 
with both sides blaming the other for the 11-hour deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee 
and the chief Democratic negotiator, accused the White House of working "in the 
shadows" to torpedo a bipartisan compromise on increasing the President's 
$7.9-billion drug plan. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.), who led the Republican team, countered that 
Byrd had called off the negotiations after rejecting the latest GOP offer, even 
though an agreement was within reach. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were moving very close, and I thought we'd complete our task 
today," Hatfield told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Bills Jeopardized 
</P>
<P>
No additional sessions were scheduled, and it was unclear if negotiations would 
be resumed next week. In addition to delaying progress on the President's drug 
plan, the impasse jeopardizes passage of several key appropriations bills 
before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate often makes back-room deals on legislation, the drug talks 
were exceptional because they centered on a major new presidential proposal 
involving what is generally regarded as the nation's most pressing problem. 
</P>
<P>
Comments by negotiators on both sides indicated that the Democrats and 
Republicans were only $50 million to $150 million apart when the talks broke 
down and that the impasse could be resolved if other issues were settled. 
</P>
<P>
One major dispute involved how much additional money would be spent on 
prevention, treatment and education. The three areas are high on the Democrats' 
priority list, in contrast to Bush's primary emphasis on law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, however, charged that the White House had jeopardized progress toward a 
compromise by intervening in the negotiations and causing increasing demands 
for Democratic concessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise Possible 
</P>
<P>
"We gave, but there was no take," he said. "I'm tired of dealing with a shadow 
team on the other side. I don't see any point in meeting and meeting and haggle 
and haggle and chip away and chip away." Despite the unexpected collapse of the 
talks, both sides indicated that they may try to salvage a compromise after a 
weekend break. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping we'll take a clear Monday morning view," Hatfield said. "We have to 
wage this war. The sooner we get at it, the better." 
</P>
<P>
"The door is open," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee and a key negotiator. Byrd agreed, noting that he was "always 
at the other end of the telephone" but was tired of meetings with no results. 
</P>
<P>
Without an agreement on an anti-drug package, Byrd said, pending appropriations 
bills would turn the Senate into a "free-for-all" as Democrats and Republicans 
vied to outdo each other with amendments to expand the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Several key appropriations bills have been stymied in the Senate by Republicans 
who hope to force a bipartisan agreement on an anti-drug measure. 
</P>
<P>
One result may be adoption of a generally disliked "continuing resolution" to 
keep running the government on an interim basis if all spending bills are not 
passed by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
A continuing resolution allows federal agencies to continue spending at 
previous levels, but it prevents new programs from starting and blocks 
additional funds for existing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield said the Republican senators, acting with White House approval, 
offered to increase spending by $850 million more than Bush's proposal and to 
allocate $750 million of that amount for treatment and prevention, as the 
Democrats wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, however, said his side already had made many concessions and wanted to 
raise Bush's spending level by $1 billion, with $800 million of that amount 
earmarked for treatment and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Both senators said there had been "serious discussion" of a compromise 
$900-million increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expansion Proposed 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member Democratic and Republican negotiating teams consisted of senior 
lawmakers appointed by the Senate leaders. The teams met repeatedly to search 
for a compromise agreement. After the President announced his drug plan in a 
nationally televised speech on Sept. 5, Byrd proposed expanding it by $2.2 
billion. He suggested providing additional financing with an across-the-board 
spending cut in most federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans countered with a plan to increase the President's proposal by $600 
million, financed by a smaller across-the-board cut and certain additional 
reductions outside the defense area. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no agreement, Sasser predicted, senators from both parties would 
offer amendments to cut weapons systems from the Pentagon budget and shift the 
funds into the drug war.

BUSH DEFENDS DRUG PURCHASE SET UP TO AID HIS SPEECH

<P>
President Bush acknowledged Friday that the government set up a drug purchase 
in a park across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to get a prop for his 
televised speech on the Administration's anti-drug strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was great," the President said, responding to questions about the 
sting operation. "It sent a message to the United States that, even across from 
the White House, they can sell drugs. It sends a powerful message to the 
American people." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the White House enthusiasm, some federal law enforcement officials said 
they were bothered by the prearranged purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stupid thing to do," said an official in a federal agency involved in 
the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree that the place (of the purchase) doesn't make that much difference, 
but the idea it was contrived all the way down the line of authority adds up to 
involving the political process in objective law enforcement," the official 
said. "We shouldn't be doing that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White House Disagrees 
</P>
<P>
But White House officials argued that the maneuver was justified, noting that 
it allowed Bush to dramatize his claim that illegal drugs are available 
throughout the nation and not just in inner-city ghettos. 
</P>
<P>
As a nationwide television audience watched the Sept. 5 address, Bush reached 
into his desk in the Oval Office and pulled out a plastic bag that contained 
rocks of crack, a powerfully addictive derivative of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, the President told the nation, was "seized a few days ago in a park 
across the street from the White House . . . . It could easily have been heroin 
or PCP." 
</P>
<P>
It was a brief, but dramatic, moment in a speech that otherwise provided little 
theater, as Bush outlined the scope of the nation's drug problem and his 
proposed remedies. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he was asked if he specifically had requested a crack purchase in 
front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I'd like to have something from that vicinity to show it can happen 
anywhere, and that's what they gave me. It was a legitimate drug bust," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
"The man went there and sold drugs in front of the White House," Bush said. 
"That's the bottom line. That's what the man did. I can't feel sorry for him." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought it was proper for a federal agent to lure a suspect to 
Lafayette Park to enhance the President's speech, Bush responded: "Every time 
that some guy gets caught selling drugs, he pleads that somebody is luring him 
someplace . . . . This is probably what he'll argue to get off." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Bush argued: "That's what you do whenever you make a bust -- you bring 
somebody someplace." 
</P>
<P>
The President appeared puzzled and angered by the questioning from reporters 
who accompanied him on a tour of a tree farm in Wells, Me., a few miles south 
of his vacation home in Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand," Bush said at one point. "I mean, has somebody got some 
advocates here for this drug guy?" 
</P>
<P>
According to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, the drug purchase was 
arranged by the Drug Enforcement Administration at the request of the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad that they did it," Fitzwater said. "The venue doesn't matter. You 
can buy drugs at 14th and U (an inner-city intersection in Washington) or at 
the Washington Monument." 
</P>
<P>
Details of the purchase were disclosed Friday by the Washington Post. In order 
to make the buy in Lafayette Park, a square block of fountains, paths, shade 
trees and benches not known as a drug market, the DEA had to entice a suspected 
drug dealer to move a meeting point several blocks to carry out a sale, the 
Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, a teen-ager, was confused and asked the undercover agent arranging 
the purchase: "Where the (expletive) is the White House?" the newspaper 
reported. Told it was the President's home, he replied: "Oh, you mean where 
Reagan lives." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that when the White House explained to the drug agency what it 
wanted to do, the reply came back: "No problem." 
</P>
<P>
"There was no deception involved," he said. "The DEA does these kinds of stings 
all the time. That's how they make most of their drug arrests." 
</P>
<P>
But Gerald M. Caplan, a George Washington University law professor and former 
general counsel for the District of Columbia metropolitan police department, 
said it was hardly a typical drug purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not really selling crack regularly in Lafayette Park. It's the 
equivalent of buying it across the street from the police station. There's a 
lot of law enforcement there," Caplan said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I find it troubling," he continued. "It looked like a publicity 
stunt. It took some effort to lure this guy to the park so the President could 
make his speech." 
</P>
<P>
But a DEA spokesman defended the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Our setting the time, place and circumstances of these buys is standard 
operating procedure," said Cornelius J. Dougherty, the spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
James Gerstenzang reported from Kennebunkport and Ronald J. Ostrow from 
Washington.

BAN OPPOSED ON SLEEPING PILL THAT CAN CAUSE AMNESIA

The world's most-prescribed sleeping pill can cause temporary memory loss but, 
because there is no evidence that it endangers public health, it should not be 
banned, a federal advisory panel said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee unanimously recommended 
that the agency change the label on Upjohn Co.'s sleeping pill -- called 
Halcion -- to warn doctors that the drug may be more likely to cause amnesia 
than similar medications. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, cases of violent behavior and death allegedly linked to 
Halcion have received considerable publicity. Upjohn contends that such 
attention has contributed to an increased number of reports of Halcion-linked 
side effects to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Daniel Casey, chairman of the FDA advisory committee, said amnesia was the 
only potential problem with Halcion that stood out in data presented Friday by 
Upjohn and the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the limited amount of information we had, we did not sense there was a 
substantial problem with other types of side effects," said Casey, chief of 
psychiatric research at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Portland, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said that 45 times more cases of temporary memory loss associated with 
Halcion were reported to the agency than for a similar drug, Sandoz's Restoril, 
between 1983 and 1988. That figure was adjusted for Halcion's larger market 
share.

CHP TO GIVE TOYOTA CAMRYS A TEST DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The California Highway Patrol will soon become the first state police force in 
the nation to use foreign cars when the agency begins road-testing seven 
Japanese-made Toyota Camrys, CHP officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
If the test goes smoothly, the department may buy a limited number of Camrys 
for use in the mountain foothills by the early 1990s, said Jay Emery, a 
transportation services manager for the department. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP is testing the Camry at the suggestion of Toyota Motor Sales USA, Emery 
said. He said the program will cost the state almost nothing because Toyota is 
selling the cars to the state for $1 each and has agreed to buy them back at 
the same price in one year. The cars sell at retail for $14,388. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Helping Out' 
</P>
<P>
"They have come to us and said they want to build the world's best police car," 
Emery said. "They have asked for our input, and we are helping out." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Michaels, product news manager for Toyota, said the company decided to 
develop a police car after getting positive reactions at a recent convention 
for auto fleet buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in the police car business," he said. "We don't offer anything for 
sale. Our purpose is to test the waters and evaluate the car's suitability 
before we take any more steps." 
</P>
<P>
A Camry is being tested at the CHP academy in West Sacramento, said Highway 
Patrol spokesman Sam Haynes. The cars are expected to appear on state highways 
in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes said it makes sense for the department to help Toyota develop a police 
car in case higher gasoline prices or other factors force American companies 
out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
"American manufacturers might decide they don't want to be in the enforcement 
vehicle business," Haynes said. "In that case, law enforcement may well have to 
explore other options." 
</P>
<P>
But Emery said the department has no immediate plans to replace its fleet of 
Dodge Diplomats, Chevrolet Caprices or Ford Mustangs. If the state does add the 
Toyota to its patrol car fleet, it will not be until at least 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Because the cars have front-wheel drive, they have better traction in wet and 
snowy conditions. Emery said the department might consider buying them for use 
in the mountain foothills where winter conditions vary frequently between snow 
and dry road. With rear-wheel drive cars, officers waste a lot of time while 
tire chains are installed or removed. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this will be a very good car for the 2,000-feet to 3,000-feet 
elevations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cars were made in Japan, Emery said he believes the special test 
arrangement will not violate a state law prohibiting the CHP from using 
foreign-made vehicles. If the state does buy any Camrys, they will be 
manufactured at Toyota's new plant in Georgetown, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
"This is merely a test," Emery said. "The end result of our test is, hopefully, 
to develop a good police package for the 1992 Camry." 
</P>
<P>
Toyota modified the six-cylinder cars at its racing facility in Torrance, 
adding heavy-duty suspensions, anti-sway bars and auxiliary engine and 
transmission coolers. The cars also have special push-bumpers, speed-rated 
tires and heavy-duty upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
The Camry, fully loaded and carrying two people, was able to go from a standing 
start to 112 m.p.h. in two miles. The Dodge Diplomat also reaches 112 m.p.h., 
while the Chevrolet Caprice can get to 120 m.p.h., and the Mustang, which is 
used for high-speed chases, can reach about 130 m.p.h.

THEY LOST A BROTHER TO BULLETS, TRUCK TO BUREAUCRACY

The family of a Mexican-born man who was shot and killed on an Orange County 
freeway in August now faces the loss of the pickup truck that police impounded 
for evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
City of Orange police had the truck towed from the family's apartment the day 
Juan Pedro Trujillo was killed. Now the towing company says the family owes 
$300 in accumulated storage fees. If the money is not paid, the family has been 
told, the truck will be sold at auction on Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"When they took the truck, we were told that it wouldn't cost us anything 
because the towing was going to be paid by the police who took the truck as 
part of an investigation to find out who shot Juan," said Trujillo's sister, 
Carmen Saragoza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Blame Family 
</P>
<P>
Orange police blame the relatives, saying that when the truck was released by 
the department on Aug. 11, the family failed to claim it. However, Saragoza 
said the family -- whose members speak little English and have trouble 
understanding the legal system -- was told by the towing firm that because of 
contracts with the Police Department a $120 fee had to be paid before the truck 
could be released. 
</P>
<P>
"What someone should have done was to call us to get the truck out," said 
Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo. "They should have complained to us about it and we 
would have helped them." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the storage costs have risen to $631, but Romo said that he 
contacted the towing company and they agreed to reduce it to $300. Family 
members, however, say they do not have the money to pay even the reduced 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
Saragoza said she and her husband, Juan, and their six children share a 
two-bedroom Anaheim apartment with another family and "we barely make ends meet 
here as you can see." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope to Visit Mexico 
</P>
<P>
The family would like to sell the 1973 Datsun pickup to help pay for a trip to 
Mexico to visit Trujillo's grave. Saragoza said they did not attend her 
brother's funeral in the rural Mexican village of El Juamuchil because they 
could not afford the air fare. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo, a tire store employee, was struck and killed when someone fired 
several rounds from a semiautomatic assault rifle into the truck as he drove on 
the Santa Ana Freeway. His passengers -- his brother, Jose, the registered 
owner of the truck, and a cousin -- were not hurt. Despite dozens of tips, 
police said they have no leads and are continuing to look for a blue Oldsmobile 
Cutlass they believe was involved in the shooting.

WALTER ZELMAN OF COMMON CAUSE TO EXPLORE RACE FOR INSURANCE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter A. Zelman, for 11 years executive director of California Common Cause, 
on Monday will begin a 30-day leave of absence from that position to explore 
running for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Democrat said that unless his prospects appear extremely 
discouraging, he intends to vie for the post next year when it becomes elective 
for the first time under the terms of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said he would run on a platform of fully implementing the initiative and 
making the commissioner's job "an office of consumer protection." 
</P>
<P>
His announcement of interest in the job came just after the U.S. Justice 
Department informed the California secretary of state's office that it will not 
interpose any objection under the federal Voting Rights Act to the post 
becoming an elective one. Since four California counties fall under the 
jurisdiction of the Voting Rights Act, a Justice Department review of that 
portion of Proposition 103 was required. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Objection 
</P>
<P>
Word that the department has no objection came in a letter signed by Barry 
Weinberg, acting chief of the voting section of the civil rights division. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman's crusades as Common Cause director for ethics in government and against 
special-interest influence have made him well known to politicians throughout 
the state, but a recent poll that he had taken indicated that his general name 
identification with the electorate is low. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, he was recently assured by a staff member of the secretary of 
state's office that he will be able to use the occupational designation of 
"director, Common Cause," beneath his name on the ballot, even though he would 
no longer be with the nonpartisan organization at election time. He would be 
allowed the designation under a policy that allows candidates to use their 
latest occupational title. 
</P>
<P>
The poll he commissioned strongly indicated that once his affiliation with 
Common Cause was made known, he gained substantial support, Zelman said. 
</P>
<P>
When potential voters were asked which of three prospective Democratic 
candidates they would support, without the occupational designation, he got 
only 4% of the vote, while Board of Equalization member Conway Collis got 5% 
and television commentator Bill Press got 12%, according to Zelman. The 
preponderant majority, 61%, were not sure at this stage, and 14% said they 
favored none of the candidates, while 4% refused to say or were leaning toward 
one candidate or another. 
</P>
<P>
But when Zelman, Collis and Press were all identified by occupation and their 
supporters in the poll, then, Zelman said, he led with 27% support, Collis had 
20% and Press 17%. The rest were not sure, favored none, refused to say or were 
only leaning. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said he would not seek to match his opposition in fund raising. He said 
he would not take any contributions from the insurance industry and would 
prefer not taking any from the trial lawyers, the other major pressure group in 
the insurance issue, although he has not completely ruled it out. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can raise a lot of money for this job healthily," Zelman remarked, 
saying it would only interfere with doing the job honestly. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman also said he would not make sweeping promises in the campaign about rate 
rollbacks or otherwise reducing everyone's rates but would instead tell the 
voters that it is a complicated issue, there are no easy solutions and he would 
work hard to develop long-range policies that would at least slow the rate of 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
"I would use Proposition 103 to the maximum to force the insurance companies to 
prove their case for increases," Zelman said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that later on, he might urge new laws to step up seat belt 
enforcement, tighten speed restrictions, move against drunk driving and, 
perhaps, institute no-fault insurance as a means of lowering rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Speaker 
</P>
<P>
Besides his Common Cause post, Zelman has served since 1984 as a Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power commissioner. He has been a frequent author of 
articles in various publications and also a frequent public speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman was educated at the University of Michigan and the London School of 
Economics before obtaining a master's degree in international relations and a 
Ph.D in political science at UCLA.

Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement vowed revenge on Friday against Saudi 
Arabia for beheading 16 Shiite Muslims from Kuwait who were convicted in two 
bombings that killed one man and injured 16 others during the annual Muslim 
pilgrimage last July in the holy city of Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, issued a statement condemning the Saudi government 
for the executions, which it described as a "massacre" and an "act of 
terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
"We consider the execution of 16 Kuwaiti pilgrims a terrorist act carried out 
by the rulers of (Saudi Arabia) who are intruders to Islam in order to satisfy 
America, the mother of decadence and terrorism in the world," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of deep hatred controlling the practices of this terrorist regime 
against the genuine Muslim will be a motivation for avenging the blood of these 
oppressed Muslims," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is believed to hold some of the 14 Western hostages missing in 
Lebanon. It has also been linked to the crash of a French DC-10 airliner in the 
Sahara Desert Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The one-page statement in Arabic was delivered to a Western news agency in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's spiritual leader, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, also warned 
during Friday prayers in Beirut of "chaos" following the executions. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was a plot to harm Iran's image and accused the Saudi judges of 
sentencing the men to death because they were Shiite pilgrims commemorating the 
death of Iran's spiritual leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
He was repeatedly interrupted by hundreds of bearded worshipers who raised 
their fists and shouted, "God is great, death to (Saudi King) Fahd." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian newspapers said Friday the Kuwaiti bombers, who were publicly 
executed on Thursday, were anti-Muslim puppets -- but made no reference to any 
Iranian involvement.

SCHOOL BUS CRASH PROBE FINDS NO PROOF THAT TRUCK BRAKES FAILED

Federal investigators found no evidence to support a truck driver's contention 
that his brakes failed before the vehicle rammed a school bus into a 
water-filled pit, killing 20 teen-agers, an official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"From a visual inspection, we can find nothing to indicate a failure in the 
braking system," said Lee Dickinson, a National Transportation Safety Board 
member. He said investigators would conduct other tests. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-member NTSB team of investigators planned to interview truck driver 
Ruben Perez and his assistant, who also was in the truck when it hit the bus 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Perez told Texas Department of Public Safety troopers that the brakes failed on 
the truck, causing him to go into the intersection and hit the bus. 
</P>
<P>
The bus, carrying 86 passengers, careened into the 40-foot pit owned by the 
city of Alton. 
</P>
<P>
The toll from the accident rose to 20 Friday with the death of Yesenia Perez, 
15. She suffered cardiac arrest, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 63 people were injured when the bus tumbled into the pit. One student 
and the bus driver, Gilberto Pena, 46, remained in critical but stable 
condition; another student was still unconscious at Mission General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Truck driver Perez, 25, was treated at Mission General and released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At the site of the accident, a wreath of blue and white flowers shook in the 
wind as streams of motorists drove by, some stopping to mourn. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only do so much," said firefighter Raul Garcia, looking into the pit 
where the day before he had helped rescue dozens of students and recover the 
bodies of others trapped in the submerged bus. 
</P>
<P>
He and a few other men had propped up the 4-foot wreath of carnations at the 
edge of the pit. "On behalf of the Alton Volunteer Fire Department," its banner 
read. 
</P>
<P>
In the small south Texas towns of Alton and Mission, many drove with their 
headlights on as a sign of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people filled the Tom Landry Stadium at Mission High School on 
Friday night to honor the bus accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
"The emptiness that we feel will not be replaced again," said Sanjuanita 
Zamora, Alton's mayor. "A part of our lives has been taken away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, about 500 people crowded into tiny San Martin de Porres 
Catholic Church for the first of the funerals, that of 12-year-old Elda 
Patricia Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't help to say why him or why her. Only God knows," Father Frank Gomez 
said in the service given in Spanish and English. 
</P>
<P>
Alton, which is about 15 miles from the Mexico border, is part of the Mission 
school district. Classes were canceled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very quiet here," said Dina Chapa, Mission High School assistant 
principal. "What we're doing right now is collecting the (victims') personal 
belongings from lockers and giving out information, finding out when the 
funerals are for the students," Chapa said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Friday that 86 people were on the bus, rather than 81 as previously 
reported. Sgt. Israel Pacheco said several students who escaped the bus with 
minor injuries walked away from the accident and were not immediately counted. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was designed to carry 83 people, according to the manufacturer. Texas 
law sets no capacity limit but says one student can be standing for each seat 
in a bus.

SHEVARDNADZE, BAKER CLASH ON 3RD WORLD POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze clashed sharply over Afghanistan and Nicaragua on Friday but also 
moved close to signing several technical agreements on arms control, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze, meeting in a luxurious lodge beneath the snow-topped 
crags of the Teton mountains, spent almost two hours of an intense one-on-one 
session sparring over their policies on the Third World conflicts, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men became so absorbed in the argument that their meeting ran more than 
an hour later than scheduled, leaving dozens of senior aides waiting in lobbies 
and hallways. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. and Soviet officials said the forceful exchange did not derail the two 
countries' plans to sign an agreement today on "trial verification" of their 
nuclear arsenals and to announce the timing of a first summit meeting between 
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials often have pointed to Soviet behavior in the 
Third World as a key test of whether the "new thinking" proclaimed by Gorbachev 
has any real impact on the Kremlin's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
According to a senior aide, Baker told Shevardnadze bluntly "that when we take 
a look at some of the patterns of Soviet involvement (in the Third World) . . . 
there is, from our standpoint, a disturbing flow of arms." 
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. intelligence reports have detected "a surge of arms" to pro-Soviet 
regimes in Cambodia and Ethiopia, "a tremendous increase" in weapons shipments 
to the pro-Moscow government in Afghanistan and a continued flow of weaponry 
from the Soviet Bloc to the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't seem to fit our understanding of what 'new thinking' is supposed 
to embody," he quoted Baker as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze rejected the criticism and accused the United States of acting 
irresponsibly by continuing its military aid to Muslim rebels in Afghanistan, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the United States is violating its obligation as a guarantor of 
the Geneva accords (reached in 1988 to end the Afghan war)," a senior Soviet 
official said, pointing to continued U.S. arms shipments to the rebels. That 
agreement calls for an end to foreign aid to the rebels, but the Bush 
Administration has said it will continue sending supplies as long as Moscow 
continues active support for the Kabul regime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Officials Annoyed 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Nicaragua, Shevardnadze annoyed U.S. officials by sticking to 
his position that the Kremlin has stopped sending arms directly to the 
Sandinistas but is powerless to stop its allies like Cuba from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
The Baker-Shevardnadze argument, as recounted by their aides, sounded like a 
return to the days of U.S.-Soviet polemics before Gorbachev came to power. But 
officials on both sides took pains to stress that the dispute did not poison 
the two countries' discussions on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a discussion that was carried on in a way that suggested that these two 
men have established a working relationship" in which both sides "have to be 
honest and candid," a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials said they were neither surprised nor upset by the U.S. 
criticism, but they also appeared anxious to turn the meeting's attention 
toward arms control, the subject the Kremlin wants to keep at the center of the 
superpower agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze and Baker spent much of the afternoon discussing the proposals 
advanced by Gorbachev in a nine-page letter that the Soviet foreign minister 
delivered to Bush on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Among Gorbachev's offers was a suggestion to break a long-running U.S.-Soviet 
deadlock over testing weapons to defend against nuclear missiles, a dispute 
that has been a major obstacle to the conclusion of a strategic arms reduction 
(START) treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor P. Karpov told reporters that his country 
was willing to agree to "some testing of devices in space" and suggested that 
the two sides agree to a list of permissible tests. U.S. officials, who have 
long asserted a right to test exotic beam devices in space under the 1972 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, said they were willing to consider the Soviet 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, some U.S. officials suggested such an approach, and the Soviets 
seemed to endorse it. But then-President Ronald Reagan, who feared limiting 
tests could cripple his controversial Strategic Defense Initiative, rejected 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the expected agreement on "trial verification" would formalize a 
surprisingly fast acceptance by the two countries of a new principle in arms 
control talks: that experiments to test the feasibility of systems to verify 
the size and location of nuclear weapons can be conducted even before a treaty 
to reduce them is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration proposed the idea in June, but Soviet officials 
insisted that the agreement to be signed today was devised by their experts in 
Moscow. The pact is a general agreement by both sides to begin working on ways 
to begin mutual verification of each others' arsenals, a key part of any arms 
reduction effort. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze are also expected to sign an agreement to exchange 
information before any major test or exercise of strategic nuclear forces, a 
Soviet official said. 
</P>
<P>
They also may sign an agreement to swap information about the size and location 
of each others' chemical weapons, a step toward reducing those arsenals, 
officials said -- although some officials said last-minute snags could delay 
that pact. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze met here, at a resort built by the late John D. 
Rockefeller III, as part of an agreement to begin varying their twice-yearly 
meetings beyond Washington and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Before they began, they took a moment to survey a breathtaking vista of glacial 
mountains, gaudy yellow aspen trees -- and a pair of courting moose. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to tie the moose down with chains," Baker quipped. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I noticed that the moose were tied up," Shevardnadze said with a laugh.

Rep. Barney Frank, in a written apology mailed to supporters Friday, said that 
"tremendous internal pressures" had led him to a relationship with a male 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
He promised that his "judgment has improved." 
</P>
<P>
"What I did was wrong," the Massachusetts Democrat said in the letter mailed to 
home-state supporters and campaign volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"It did not affect my public decisions or any public business. But I regret 
that some of my past personal actions are troubling to people who placed their 
confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was not mailed at government expense, a Frank aide said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It was sent at the end of a week in which the five-term liberal congressman and 
his top political advisers moved to quell growing speculation that he would 
resign rather than await a House Ethics Committee inquiry into his relationship 
with Stephen L. Gobie. 
</P>
<P>
Frank was reelected in 1988 after disclosing the year before that he is 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
Gobie alleges that he operated a prostitution ring out of Frank's Capitol Hill 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Frank has acknowledged paying Gobie for sex, then hiring him as a personal 
assistant and driver in an effort to change Gobie's life. Frank says he fired 
Gobie when he began to suspect the prostitution operation.

Investigators on Friday examined a delivery truck to see if its brakes failed 
before it rammed a crowded school bus into a water-filled pit, while the death 
toll from the accident rose to 20. 
</P>
<P>
At least 63 people were injured when the bus tumbled into the 40-foot pit 
Thursday. Two students and the bus driver, Gilberto Pena, 46, remained in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Yesenia Perez of Mission suffered cardiac arrest Friday, 
bringing the death toll to 20, a hospital spokeswoman said. Like many students 
who were trapped in the overturned and sunken bus, the girl inhaled a great 
deal of water, Mission General spokeswoman Linda Thayer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten National Transportation Safety Board inspectors on Friday began inspecting 
the bus and the delivery truck. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we will be looking at is the (truck's) braking system," 
safety board member Lee V. Dickinson said.

<P>
In the small south Texas towns of Alton and Mission, many drove with their 
headlights on as a sign of mourning. Flags were at half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
Funerals for some of the students were conducted Friday afternoon, followed by 
a community memorial service in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole town is crying with the relatives of those who died," said Father 
Frank Gomez, pastor of San Martin de Porres Catholic Church, where some victims 
attended Mass.

<P>
Alton, a town of 3,700 about 15 miles from the Mexico border, is part of the

More than 7,000 tons of U.S.-donated food has arrived in Lebanon to feed needy 
families throughout the country, it was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Agency for International Development said the food arrived by ship at the 
northern port of Tripoli and will be distributed by Save the Children, a relief 
organization based in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
The food consists of rice, lentils and vegetable oil. During heavy fighting 
over the past several months, the relief group has distributed rations to about 
a third of the population of Lebanon, the announcement said.

Virginia's highest court, in the nation's first appeal of a murder trial based 
on DNA evidence, on Friday upheld the conviction and death sentence of a man in 
the rape-murders of two women. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court, in unanimous rulings, said that DNA test results 
submitted as evidence at two of Timothy W. Spencer's trials were shown to be "a 
reliable scientific technique" and that the tests were properly conducted. 
</P>
<P>
DNA is the basic genetic material found in human cells. Everyone except 
identical twins is believed to have a unique DNA pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, 26, was convicted after samples of semen found at the crime scenes in 
the two cases were compared to DNA patterns in Spencer's blood. Experts 
testified that the samples matched.

Gov. Bob Martinez on Friday ordered an abortion clinic closed because of 
reports of botched abortions and directed a state agency to come up with 
tougher rules to protect women at private clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez denied that he was using the situation to enact emergency regulations 
on abortion just weeks before the Legislature takes up the issue in special 
session. 
</P>
<P>
He told Health and Rehabilitative Services Secretary Greg Coler to begin steps 
to revoke the license of the Women's Service Center after a report in the Miami 
Herald about improper abortions by unlicensed physicians that resulted in 
ruptured uteri and hysterectomies.

'DROOD': A WINK AT AN UNDEMANDING AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Rupert Holmes wrote the music, lyrics and book for "The Mystery of Edwin 
Drood," you know he had the community theater circuit in mind, where audiences 
aren't at their most particular and the actors can do a stretch without having 
to do Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
The one caveat is that the theater has to cast good singers: some of Holmes' 
better songs simply will not do with any less. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, in other words, had in mind something like Jody Johnston Davidson's 
production at the Laguna Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
At the California Music Theatre last year, the show was simply "Drood," but 
under any title Holmes' gimmick is the same. 
</P>
<P>
London's Music Hall Royale of 1892 is presenting for our pleasure a 
musicalization of Charles Dickens' incomplete novel, "The Mystery of Edwin 
Drood," with an ending that's partly supplied by the audience: We get to vote 
on poor Edwin's killer. 
</P>
<P>
The gimmicks go down better in this easy-to-swallow form than in Holmes' recent 
bag of plot contortions, "Accomplice." The music hall tradition is little more 
than theatrical tomfoolery, always played out with a huge wink and a nod to the 
crowd, charmingly bulldogged on by the Chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The California Music Theatre had Mr. Chairman himself, the late George Rose. 
Here, Michael C. Miller's Chairman stands up fairly well, although we could do 
with some more dogging. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is with Davidson's show. The feeling is of a very good facsimile of 
the old music hall, which never completely transports us. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't because of the simple technical errors, like an errant curtain or a 
set piece that doesn't completely cooperate -- that only adds to a music hall's 
rough-and-ready nature which, again, makes "Edwin Drood" a comfortable fit for 
a non-professional theater. 
</P>
<P>
It's because of high-tech non-necessities, such as the jarring synthesizer in 
conductor Joseph Mulroy's nice little orchestra (which already includes a 
piano) and tinny miking in what's a very intimate house (Stephen Shaffer did 
the sound). 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some actors hold up better than others. 
</P>
<P>
William Sandidge seems dazed as the Reverend, and the mugging of Mark Perkins 
as the villain Jasper and of Eric Anderson as a Ceylonese incongruously named 
Neville Landless are excessive even by music hall standards. 
</P>
<P>
They don't take us out of Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Freiman's beautifully sung Rosa Bud, Katy Henk's spunky turn on Edwin and 
Norma Stone's jaunty Princess Puffer absolutely do. With them, the audience 
needed no prodding in their reactions from Lyndie Robbins as Miss Violet 
Throttle, the Stage Manager. 
</P>
<P>
They also seemed to love the combination of Kathy Pryzgoda's lights and Ellis 
Pryce-Jones' quaint set pieces that look almost homemade. With the right play, 
a bigger budget is not necessarily better. 
</P>
<P>
 At 606 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; 
Sundays at 2:30 p.m., and Monday, Oct. 16, at 8 p.m.. Through Oct. 17. Tickets:

POP BEAT: METALLICA: A FUTURE WITHOUT THE FURY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A phase is ending for Metallica, and it will be interesting to see where the 
most ferocious of heavy-metal bands will turn next. 
</P>
<P>
After well over a year on the road, the future probably was the last thing the 
Northern California band had in mind Thursday night at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. Before a capacity crowd of 15,000 who slammed fists, heads and 
bodies to its rumbling slab of sound, Metallica began a three-night stand 
(ending tonight) that concludes its U.S. tour behind the double-platinum album 
". . . And Justice for All." (There are, though, a few more dates in South 
America before the group gets to rest.) 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Metallica gave itself more than two hours to review territory 
covered thus far. 
</P>
<P>
There was speed metal -- an '80s sub-genre that Metallica pretty much defined 
-- all frenetic chugging, meet-at-the-final-angry-chord-and-melody-be-damned. 
There were slower, lumbering head-banger beats, familiar to heavy-rock fans 
since Black Sabbath's early days, but seldom delivered with more glowering 
intensity. And, in the departure that makes Metallica's future worth pondering, 
there were sculpted, episodic pieces in which the band explores guitar lyricism 
between blasts of its accustomed headlong fury. 
</P>
<P>
Fury and revulsion are the basis for virtually all of Metallica's music. The 
show began with "Blackened," a grim portrayal of nuclear holocaust. Taking off 
from this opening overview of the Earth's fate, James Hetfield, Metallica's 
singer-lyricist, spent the rest of the concert roaring about such subsidiary 
evils as conventional war, insanity, suicide and drug addiction. Metallica 
capped its show -- as it has for this entire tour -- by exploding a massive 
statue of Blind Justice that, in a less elaborate echo of Pink Floyd's staging 
of "The Wall," had been built bit by bit while the band played on a set that 
looked like a courthouse ruin. 
</P>
<P>
The seriousness and passion with which Metallica attacks its dark themes is 
unusual for heavy metal, and that seriousness sets a welcome example for bands 
and fans who want to move beyond the typical metal subjects of sexual swagger, 
dumb fun and sword-and-sorcery fantasy escape. But Metallica still is prone to 
one common metal malady: a tendency to inflate ideas to an epic scale while 
cloaking them in dramatic abstractions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Metallica's future can bring a more personal approach to songwriting, 
not to mention an exploration of some less dire subjects. The band did show it 
could create a lighter mood during an offhanded encore that included one or two 
metal-boogie numbers played in a garage-rock style that was loose but still 
emphatic. 
</P>
<P>
Another question for the future is how far Metallica is willing to go toward 
balancing brute force with lyricism. While the band's hammering power is surely 
at the core of its success, the show's most affecting moments came when the din 
subsided for stately harmony guitar parts that achieved a lovely grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
"Fade to Black," the meditation on suicide, ended with a memorable passage in 
which lead guitarist Kirk Hammett combined force and melody to fine emotional 
effect. It conveyed deep sorrow without reining in the band's hard-rock thrust. 
During his otherwise unremarkable solo guitar spot, Hammett paid homage to Jimi 
Hendrix's "Little Wing," the zenith of rock guitar lyricism. Not a bad 
direction to keep pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
Also open to question, of course, is whether Metallica's audience would be 
willing to follow if the band decided to move further from a pure speed-metal 
base and closer to the more lyrical hard-rock tradition of Hendrix and the Who. 
But on this night, the point was to enjoy the band-audience bond as it exists 
now, in a show that recapitulated Metallica's past with authority. 
</P>
<P>
If Metallica doesn't leap into the metal future, Faith No More may get there 
first. The Bay Area band's opening set was a boundary-breaking amalgam of 
progressive-rock keyboards, rap-soul vocals, thrash-metal rhythms and wailing 
heavy guitar -- all held together with accomplished playing. Singer Mike Patton 
spent too much time fretting aloud about the less than rapturous reception the 
band was getting. He ought to relax: An adventurous approach always takes some 
time to sink in. 
</P>

Margaret Randall poses that question in her introduction to the book, "The 
Rosenbergs: Collected Visions of Artists and Writers." An account of her own 
experience provides some answers. 
</P>
<P>
An American-born poet and photographer, Randall moved to Mexico in 1961. When 
she returned to the United States to live in 1984, she had to petition for 
residency. During her interview with the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, several of her books were spread before her. Passages critical of U.S. 
foreign policy were highlighted in yellow. There, she writes, "I encountered my 
first tangible evidence that the McCarthy Era is still very much alive in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
That the constricted freedoms of the 1950s have parallels in the present was 
something that had also occurred to Rob Okun, editor of "The Rosenbergs," which 
was published last year. Okun, referring to the period in terms of its victims 
rather than its chief persecutor, organized the exhibition, "Unknown Secrets: 
Art and the Rosenberg Era," with curator Nina Felshin. 
</P>
<P>
The show, at the San Diego State University Art Gallery through Oct. 6, 
impresses a formidable weight on the consciences of its viewers. It testifies 
to the lingering presence of anti-communism, anti-Semitism and the government's 
desire to streamline political beliefs -- forces that were instrumental in the 
conviction and execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
All of the artists in the show, whether working in the '50s or the '80s, assume 
the Rosenbergs' innocence of the charges of passing secrets of the atomic bomb 
to the Soviet Union. (Okun states in "The Rosenbergs" that he could find no 
examples of anti-Rosenberg art.) Most relegate facts and figures of the case to 
the background of their work. They use historical data as a framework upon 
which to construct statements about such broader, ever topical issues as 
scapegoating, paranoia and fear of the "other." 
</P>
<P>
Several artists who responded to the Rosenberg case as it transpired adopted a 
direct, imploring tone in their paintings and prints. The urgency of their 
</P>
<P>
appeal finds its most powerful form in a woodcut by the Mexican artist 
Francisco Mora. The poster, from 1952, pleads for letters to be sent to the 
U.S. president to "stop the crime" of the Rosenbergs' impending execution. The 
poster shows a strong, bare arm reaching out and preventing the richly adorned 
arm of American industry from pulling the switch to send the Rosenbergs to 
their death. 
</P>
<P>
Other works from the '50s humanize the couple whose case has become a symbol of 
cold-war politics. Pablo Picasso's delicate lithograph of the faces of Ethel 
and Julius Rosenberg brings the notoriety of the case down to an intimate, 
personal scale. Fernand Leger's silk screen, "Liberty, Peace, Solidarity," 
approaches lyricism with its hovering streaks of lavender, yellow and red, its 
tender depiction of the Rosenbergs beside a dove and the gentle meeting of two 
hands, one handcuffed and the other free. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond humanizing the Rosenbergs, many artists from both the past and present 
attempt to portray the beleaguered couple as heroes. Rupert Garcia's large 
pastel portraits of Ethel and Julius are monumental and sympathetic. Newspaper 
photographs of the pair kissing and being carted off in a police van recur in 
other works with the frequency and often the reverential treatment of icons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentimentality Dissipates 
</P>
<P>
Most of the sentimentality that crops up in the work of the 1950s has 
dissipated by the 1980s, and the contemporary artists invited to participate in 
the show regard the Rosenberg case with keen scrutiny and a sharp sense of its 
ramifications for the present. Their work tends to be more analytical, but no 
less gripping. 
</P>
<P>
Although portraits such as Picasso's and Garcia's humanize the Rosenbergs, many 
of the contemporary works focus on the forces and strategies that dehumanized 
them in the first place. Deborah Small's "Witch Hunt" blares out a cacophonous 
cry of labels used to brand those who deviate from the political mainstream. 
"Pinko," "provocateur," "pawn," "dupe," "devil" and "Judas of democracy" are 
spelled out in painted blocks and arranged in rows across the wall, 
interspersed with communist symbols, blacklists and historical references to 
the hunting down of witches. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Arneson sets his bronze double-portrait of the Rosenbergs on the floor, 
their open mouths and hollow eyes giving them the appearance of falling down a 
deep well. Across their foreheads runs the label, "2 Fried Commie Jew Spies." 
</P>
<P>
Such disturbing images shift attention from the crime purportedly committed by 
the Rosenbergs to the crime inflicted on them. Sue Coe's haunting painting of 
truth strapped into the electric chair suggests the importance of martyrs in 
fulfilling the "Needs of the State." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touring Through 1991 
</P>
<P>
This show has been touring nationally for a year already, and will stop in four 
more cities through 1991. Its presence in San Diego is particularly timely, for 
it adds fuel to a local debate over government censorship of the arts. 
Installation gallery, which originally planned to host "Unknown Secrets," 
recently was denied public funding for its exhibition program after sponsoring 
a billboard critical of the city. This show not only argues against such 
censorship but also makes a strong case for renewed support of Installation's 
program. 
</P>
<P>
On a national level, Congress is grappling with the issue of arts censorship. A 
proposal to temporarily "blacklist" two arts institutions for having promoted 
work deemed offensive and obscene is under discussion, as is an amendment to 
bar such work from receiving federal support. Many of the works in "Unknown 
Secrets" certainly would be denied funding under the proposed criteria simply 
because they use religious imagery or the symbol of the flag to empower their 
message. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of both the current show and the congressional debate is art's 
power to affect society. By teaching, provoking, posing questions and rubbing 
raw our blind faith in the system, "Unknown Secrets" asserts the positive 
impact of that power. Many of today's leaders fear that power and are therefore 
attempting to control it and legislate its boundaries. Maybe some nations never 
do learn their lessons.

'ALPHABET' TRANSLATES INTO NOBLE FAILURE

After 10 years on the front lines of performance art, Sushi is still ferreting 
out the new and different. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Alphabet of Bones," the first of seven dance-oriented events included 
in Sushi's multi-faceted 10th anniversary season, illustrates that search. In 
this serious study of parallel languages, which premiered at Sushi's 
second-story loft space Thursday night, even the basic alphabet is unique. 
</P>
<P>
The birth of cutting-edge artworks can be painful and there is no guarantee 
that the entire concept will work, or that individual elements will meld into a 
unified whole. "From the Alphabet of Bones" is a noble failure, a project that 
strives for brave new worlds but suffers from its own esoteric pursuits and 
diversity of spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Translating textual or visual material into movement and voice is not new. But 
visual artist Joyce Cutler-Shaw, choreographer Nancy Karp, and composer Chaya 
Czernowin definitely moved into uncharted territory when they attempted to find 
equivalents to Cutler-Shaw's calligraphy (a symbolic language based on the 
fragile skeletal structure of birds) in music and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Their common purpose apparently was to call attention to environmental 
concerns. Cutler-Shaw's bird imagery, seen as light projections on the floor 
and backdrop, was selected as the metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
However, instead of integrating the individual elements and creating some sort 
of coherent entity, the artists offered their individual voices as a string of 
disparate parts. The effect was a baffling whole that seemed to have been 
assembled with scissors and paste pot. 
</P>
<P>
The sequence began with a dance version of the bone alphabet, then evolved into 
a spoken text written and recited by Cutler-Shaw. It culminated in the 
disembodied sound structures created and sung by the composer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the program notes, "the sequence from A to Z represents a journey 
and reads as a visual dance." But that journey was long, labored, disjointed 
and often incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
The fascinating bird imagery that inspired the three-way collaboration failed 
to achieve its potential of providing strong visual support. Although the 
artist lined the back wall of the theater with an ominous assortment of caged 
birds, the stage was bare. And the projections on the floor and backdrop never 
revealed the power of some of the artist's original work. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the spoken and sung texts were too protracted and visually 
unexciting to be theatrically viable by themselves. Cutler-Shaw's poetic 
recitation of the story of evolution and her impassioned evocation of 
"unspeakable acts" (a joint reference to the Holocaust and the destruction of 
wildlife) were moving but isolated from the rest of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Also isolated were Czernowin's primordial wails and hisses, an often 
heart-wrenching vocabulary of wordless sounds that recalled the ear-piercing 
sonic structures of post-modern pioneer Meredith Monk. 
</P>
<P>
Monk suggests that the voice is a tool for activating, remembering and 
discovering "pre-logical consciousness." Czernowin used her voice to achieve 
this effect, but the musical portion was oppressively long and visually static. 
Perhaps that was part of its message, but an active visual or kinetic thrust 
was sorely needed. 
</P>
<P>
Karp, a San Francisco-based choreographer, communicated the bone alphabet first 
as a solo dance for herself and later as a duet for Deirdre Carrigan and Diane 
McKallip. If Karp and her dancers were interpreting an alphabet, it was not 
obvious. The rhythmic flow of interesting abstractions suggested, but never 
mimicked, the movement of birds. 
</P>
<P>
The dance was lyrical -- the lightest element in a dark work -- ending with a 
painful plea for survival. The environmental sounds by Bill Fontana that 
accompanied both dance episodes were another plus. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually these three talented artists may be able to use their newly created 
alphabets to explore the theme of survival with more theatricality. For now, 
however, "From the Alphabet of Bones" is a flightless bird waiting for a chance 
to soar. 
</P>
<P>
The performance will repeat at Sushi Performance Gallery at 8 o'clock tonight 
and Sunday.

SLEDGEHAMMER DELIVERS WITH A FORCEFUL DRAMA

The idea that killers are made, not born, is the message in Rainer Werner 
Fassbinder's tormented "Pre-Paradise Sorry Now," now playing at Sledgehammer 
Theatre's latest hit-and-run location: 420 1st Ave., between Island and the 
railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Feldsher, artistic director of Sledgehammer, has taken Fassbinder's play, 
based on the real-life story of serial killers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, and 
transformed a script without a single stage direction into a driving drama of 
vignettes. Under Feldsher's direction, the story points forcefully at 
connections between an authoritarian religious upbringing, violence towards 
women and gay males, the erotic menace of a snuff scene, identification between 
sex and death, and the Nazi philosophy that can lead people to justify 
destroying what they call subhuman forms of life. 
</P>
<P>
There is a repeated theme of two versus one, beginning with the young Ian being 
whipped by a priest and a nun, continuing with two men raping an office worker, 
and culminating in the team of Brady and Hindley singling out vulnerable 
individuals to kill together. Just as some couples rejoice in bringing forth 
new life, in this world of inverse morality these two delight in bringing forth 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Under Feldsher's taut direction, the actors seem to burn with the anger that 
fuels their characters. An excellent ensemble of Martin Katz, Walter Murray, 
Todd O'Keefe, Melissa Reaves, Paty Sipes and Linda Castro, dressed in stark, 
black and white costumes by Cynthia Wood, is as kinetically in motion as the 
harsh and blaring sound design by Bruce McKenzie. McKenzie (also currently 
performing in "Albanian Softshoe" at the San Diego Rep), brings a sense of 
twisted torment to the leading role of Ian, and Dorrie Sharee Board seems 
appropriately big, blonde and devoted as Myra, Ian's fantasy Valkyrie goddess 
of a woman. There's a touch of Lady Macbeth in her performance, as she takes 
her man's idea of shedding blood and encourages him to bring it to its natural 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brill, the remarkable resident set designer for this company, plunges 
behind a scrim into the considerable depths of the warehouse where the show 
takes place to portray the living quarters of Ian and Myra. The ensemble wreaks 
its havoc on the narrow stage, spilling, at times, out into the audience area. 
Dave Cannon's video design is a continual reminder of the all-too-real outside 
world in which such madness prevails. 
</P>
<P>
This production has already laid itself open to some criticism that it 
exploits, even as it condemns, the violence and pornography it depicts. That is 
a judgment that doesn't seem called for here. Horror for the heart of darkness 
in this story drips as surely as the blood on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances at 10:30 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays, through Sept. 30. At 420 1st 
Ave., between Island and the railroad tracks.

KEYBOARDIST PEET PLANS DARING 'DAY OF MUSIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Peet has been a fixture on the local jazz scene for years, supplied the 
ballpark organ music for the hit movie "Bull Durham" and toured Japan last 
year. The Mar Vista keyboard player has three albums out on the local Nine 
Winds label, two tapes on his own Killzone label, played piano jazz standards 
in a Beverly Hills hotel and recorded demos with aspiring singers in his home 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
But chances for Peet, 34, to perform his own compositions in Los Angeles are 
rare -- except at events like the California Outside Music Assn.'s Day of Music 
in Long Beach today, when 32 artists will present non-mainstream music from 
noon to midnight at four small venues in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Said Peet, whose quartet is scheduled to perform a set of his electric keyboard 
material at Mum's Ristorante at 6 p.m., of the local scene: "It's like a roller 
coaster. You carve out your own niche and it's there for awhile and disappears 
and you start from ground zero again. The weird thing is that any time we've 
played music that's a little more adventurous, we've always gotten a very good 
response from audiences." 
</P>
<P>
The Day of Music program will include musicians working in the 
electronic-contemporary classical, world-ethnic, jazz and avant-rock 
improvisational fields. The venues -- the Systems M Club, Mum's, the 
Williams/Lamb Gallery and the Works Gallery -- are clustered around the corner 
of West 3rd Street and Pine Avenue. Admission is free until 5 p.m. -- after 
that, one $4 admission will gain admittance to all performances at any venue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an attempt to do something very non-L.A. -- to concentrate rather than 
diverge," said Titus Levi, association president and founder. "Part of the 
reason was to show the diversity of (music) programming available in Los 
Angeles by concentrating it in one place. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're doing little concerts in L.A. as the ICA (Independent Composers 
Assn.) or COMA, it's only going to attract so much attention. If you get all 
the little people together and they yell at once, you can hear something." 
</P>
<P>
The California association was formed in 1983 by Levi, 26, and several friends 
who shared an interest in non-mainstream music. The nonprofit organization 
quickly became a network for musicians working in assorted noncommercial veins 
and presented concerts in various clubs around Los Angeles and Long Beach. The 
assistance was invaluable to musicians such as Tom Dougherty, who played in 
various bands in Oregon before selling his drums for a computer and starting 
his postgraduate studies in cognitive psychology and music perception at 
Claremont College in 1985. Saturday, Dougherty will perform his "remote 
control" style compositions on a Macintosh SE computer hooked up to a 
synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
"When my father hears new music, he say he doesn't understand it and wants to 
know what to listen for," Dougherty said. "I don't have any good suggestions -- 
I try to create fresh, original music and avoid every possible cliche to come 
up with new ways of thinking about sound and music. 
</P>
<P>
"People give me interesting feedback -- some say that my music has more soul 
than any computer music they've heard. The term 'computer music' scares a lot 
of people because they think someone's just gonna be onstage, hit a button and 
walk off." 
</P>
<P>
Levi now divides his time between managing the association's $5,000-$10,000 
annual budget, working as the curatorial associate for music on the forthcoming 
Los Angeles Festival and postgraduate studies in economics at UC Irvine. The 
schedule won't deter Levi from his quest to expose Los Angeles audiences to 
non-commercial music. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Stravinsky said, 'People don't know what they like -- they like what 
they know,' " he said. "The problem is that people won't try anything different 
and the press and radio stations, with the possible exception of KPFK, have 
really ignored the creative music scene in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
"People have to get through their heads that innovation invigorates everybody. 
The music is good so I know I've got the right ace in the hole...if I can just 
get people to the hole."

ANDERSEN EVOKES GHOST OF TROUBADOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the notion of what folk music is hasn't been quite the same since Bob 
Dylan plugged in with a band, there is still much to be said for the voice of 
the lone troubadour in that music, with a strong case being made by Dylan 
contemporary Eric Andersen's solo set Thursday at Bogart's in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With songs drawn largely from his current "Ghosts Upon the Road" album, 
Andersen -- working alone with a guitar and mouth harp -- was able to evoke the 
solitary wanderer's acute vision and romanticism that had marked his best early 
work. That was no mean task, considering the "Ghosts" album comes laden with a 
Winnebago-load of overly portentous and dramatized arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
But released by Andersen's direct stage delivery and evocative voice, "Listen 
to the Rain" revealed a fragile beauty, while the down-scaled "Too Many Times 
(I Will Try)" came across as an intensely personal anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Announced as a "murder ballad" for people tired of love songs, the half-spoken 
"Trouble in Paris" favorably recalled Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks" narrative 
style. In a 13-song set that also included the mid-'60s' "Close the Door 
Lightly When You Go" and "More Often Than Not" from 1972's "Blue River" album, 
the only number which didn't connect was the 10-minute autobiographical 
narrative "Ghosts on the Road." The recollection of his scuffling days lacked 
the small details and insights needed to make the story breathe. JIM WASHBURN

BEVERLY HILLS DIAMOND JUBILEE TO END WITH DRAWINGS, DINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Beverly Hills -- pop. 66,000, not counting rubbernecks and quidnuncs -- a 
network of underground pedestrian/shopping streets is graced with 
many-splendored artificial trees and 24-hour simulated sunlight. Coin-operated 
robot porters with voice-recognition sensors tote heavy packages to the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast underground garage is patrolled by another species of humanoid 
(caninoid?), these tooled to look like pet dogs but functioning as police 
vehicles. Detective work, as a matter of fact, is so enhanced by electronics 
that criminals have traded their shivs and jimmies for desktop computers. 
Panicky women in need of a last-minute coif "beam over to their hairdressers. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
It's the Beverly Hills of 2064, as envisioned by Margaret Harris, editor of the 
local Post, and it swings focus on the spiffy little city from the past to the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday marks the grand finale of the spectacular, somewhat self-conscious 
celebration of its Diamond Jubilee, an extravaganza that has lasted 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
Events are scheduled throughout the day in Roxbury Park, where during random 
drawings for 75 prizes, one lucky drawer will snuggle home a $75,000 diamond 
earrings, necklace and ring set. (One may only hope it's not someone in the 
business; in Beverly Hills, there may be more jewelers per square person than 
on any other turf in the world.) 
</P>
<P>
Thirty of the area's best restaurants will hawk their succulents from designer 
booths; a wine pavilion will pour for charity; a "big surprise, 14 feet tall 
and weighing 6 tons," will feed 25,000 people, beginning at 5:30. (Hint: one of 
the sponsors is Haagen-Dazs.) 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 10:45 a.m. and lasting until 7 p.m., a Japanese Zither ensemble, 
Okinawan dancers and the Rodeo Drive Band, among others, will attempt to 
titillate even the most jaded musical tastes. Calligraphy, bonsai and karate 
demonstrations; rides, games and activities for kids; a Will Rogers 
impersonator . . . it all will lead up to the 75th birthday's grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration opened with a cast of 1,400 (including the Rockettes) and a 
historical tribute by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and pals. It will peak at 4:30 on a 
gentler note, with a 250-voice youth choir backing a dramatic reading by actor 
Jon Voight. 
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday night, the Harry Winston people in the Beverly Hills Hotel will 
finally begin to disassemble their trademark "pastry," a $20-million, 
2,400-diamond slice of "carat cake." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they're already preparing for 2064, so watch what you pet. It may be 
a police car. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the event is free. Roxbury Park is situated at Roxbury Drive and 
Olympic Boulevard. Parking at Beverly Hills High on Moreno or at Neiman Marcus, 
9700 Wilshire Blvd., with shuttle service to and from the park. DICK RORABACK

UNBEATEN MISSION VIEJO ROLLS ALONG; 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE, DEFENSE SOLID IN ROUTING FOUNTAIN VALLEY, 34-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Two questions came to mind after Mission Viejo High School's 34-7 victory over 
Fountain Valley Friday night at Sheue Field in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Which is more formidable, Mission Viejo's defense or its offense? The Diablos 
are averaging 44 points per game in three lopsided victories, but their defense 
has allowed only one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And second, who figures to become the No. 1-ranked team in Orange County after 
previously top-ranked Los Alamitos' 24-21 upset loss to Villa Park on Thursday 
night? Mission Viejo or El Toro? 
</P>
<P>
Mike Milner, Fountain Valley's coach, offered some insight to the second 
question after watching his team, which was missing six starters because of 
injuries, lose for the second consecutive week. El Toro beat Fountain Valley, 
27-19, last week. 
</P>
<P>
"El Toro has more weapons offensively, but Mission Viejo's defense is pretty 
solid from the front line to the secondary," Milner said. "El Toro has the best 
quarterback in the county, and that might mean the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both very good teams, and I'd pay to see the game when they play each 
other. It was obvious this wasn't the same Fountain Valley team that played so 
well last week." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to the first question: Offense or defense? Mission Viejo's 
defense sparkled, allowing only 35 yards rushing and 78 yards passing. Three 
opponents have averaged only 108 yards in total offense this season. 
</P>
<P>
But Mission Viejo's offense was no less than imposing. Quarterback Don Disbro 
passed for two touchdowns, tailback Mark Gaw scored three touchdowns and 
fullback Ryan Darke added two more touchdowns in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Disbro completed five of eight passes for 69 yards, connecting with Gaw on 
scoring passes of 24 and 26 yards. Gaw displayed plenty of power on his first 
score when he appeared to be stopped at Fountain Valley's 19-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Gaw caught a short screen pass from Disbro, but when he headed up field, he 
failed to find any blockers. He was hit by three defenders but broke through a 
pile and ran 24 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Darke's most impressive run was a 28-yard sprint through the heart of Fountain 
Valley's defense that finished the scoring for Mission Viejo in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley managed to avoid a shutout when tailback Brian Williams scored 
on a one-yard run with 37 seconds remaining. It was the second touchdown 
Mission Viejo has allowed this season, but the first by its defense. University 
scored last week on a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids were pretty upset when they read a comment last week from Fountain 
Valley that El Toro is the best team in the county," said Mike Rush, Mission 
Viejo coach. "All I'll say is that we're improving every week." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the issue of who is the county's best team won't rest until Mission 
Viejo plays El Toro Oct. 27 in South Coast League play.

VALENCIA IS IMPRESSIVE AGAIN, DEFEATS EL DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Valencia and El Dorado high schools, two teams going in opposite directions, 
met Friday night in their annual battle for Placentia bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
The future is bright for Valencia, which defeated El Dorado, 35-0, in front of 
2,000 at Bradford Stadium. The Tigers have a 3-0 record and are quickly 
becoming a team to watch in the Orange County rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the season is quickly taking on nightmarish overtones for El Dorado. 
The Golden Hawks were badly beaten for the third consecutive game Friday. In 
three games they have yet to score a touchdown or a field goal, and have been 
outscored, 130-2. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia got off to a running start, scoring on three of its first four 
possessions and adding a fourth touchdown on a 34-yard fumble return by 
sophomore running back/defensive back Ryan Roskelly. 
</P>
<P>
With El Dorado on its 40-yard line, Roskelly scooped up an errant pitch on the 
dead run and raced untouched into the end zone. He also scored on runs of seven 
and 16 yards and John Fewell had a six-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime it was 28-0 and El Dorado was running for cover. 
</P>
<P>
Fewell added a nine-yard touchdown run in the third quarter for the final 
margin. But make no mistake, it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia had one touchdown -- a one-yard run by Fewell -- called back because 
of a penalty and later fumbled away another chance at the El Dorado two-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
It was an impressive display by the Tigers nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
"We played pretty well," said Mike Marrujo, Valencia coach. "We executed well. 
We wanted to make a point of getting better this week." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers' defense clobbered El Dorado running backs all game long and kept 
its passing game off balance with a heavy rush. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers tell the story: 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado had three first downs, minus-38 yards in offense and did not pass 
midfield. The Golden Hawks' first first down came with 5 minutes 33 seconds 
left in the half and by then they trailed, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense has been what's won games for us for years," Marrujo said. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia wasn't too shabby on offense either. The Tigers had 309 yards in 
offense, 133 on passes from quarterback Richard Wells. 
</P>
<P>
"He's played very well, very consistent, for us," Marrujo said of Wells, a 
senior who was a backup last season. 
</P>
<P>
Fewell, a junior, rushed for a game-high 77 yards in 14 carries and Sergio 
Ortiz and Roskelly added 32 and 30 yards, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Next up for Valencia is Troy, which beat El Dorado, 46-0, last week. 
</P>
<P>
Next for El Dorado is Fullerton and a hope that next week is the week the 
Golden Hawks can turn their season around.

LA HABRA'S EFFORT FALLS JUST SHORT; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPION LOS ALTOS REGISTERS TOUGH 24-13 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
After watching his team lose to Los Altos High School, the Division IV 
defending champion and No. 1-ranked team, 24-13, Friday night, La Habra Coach 
Jack Nichols wiped the tears from his eyes, huddled with his players and with 
all the volume his lungs could offer, let his feelings be known. 
</P>
<P>
"Any other team would have quit! You didn't quit!" he shouted. "You almost won 
the football game. They're the No.1-ranked team in the state. You can beat 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, emotions ran high at Los Altos, where an estimated 2,500 fans watched La 
Habra (2-1) put up a valiant fight. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Highlanders trailed 14-0 at halftime and 21-0 early in the third 
quarter, they never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids showed great, great character out there," he said, bear-hugging 
running back Mark Brown in midsentence. "They just would not give up. They 
haven't been behind all year, but tonight they came out after being down at the 
half and gave it their all." 
</P>
<P>
Although La Habra quarterback Mark Moreno completed only four of 15 passes for 
58 yards and was intercepted twice, he showed great promise midway through the 
third quarter with two consecutive touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
Brown connected with Moreno on a screen pass and then raced down the sideline 
for the Highlanders' first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on La Habra's next possession, Moreno hit junior Mike Miller in the end 
zone for a 24-yard touchdown pass. La Habra's extra point attempt fell short, 
and Los Altos led 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Altos, relying on the talented tandem of running backs Roger Boden (144 
yards in 17 carries and a touchdown) and Fernando Zambrano (76 yards in 12 
carries and a touchdown), finished off its next drive with a 32-yard field goal 
by Cortney Smith for its final 24-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard-hitting game, we got a couple breaks in the beginning," said Los 
Altos' 23-year coach Dwayne DeSpain, who earned his 190th victory. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we jumped out 21-0 and thought we got them on the run, the kids just 
got lazy on us. I got to give coach Nichols credit -- you gotta praise La 
Habra." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, younger brother of former Servite star Derek Brown, was slow warming up 
but finished with 106 yards in 12 carries, including a 58-yard sprint down the 
sideline to set up the Highlanders' first score and a 36-yard run to set up 
their second.

Although Torrey Pines High School made a 13-point comeback in the third quarter 
against El Toro, they couldn't overcome the Chargers' 35 first-half points and 
lost to El Toro, 42-13. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro wasted no time, scoring 12 seconds into the game when Danny Maestas 
took the third opening kick (the first two traveled out of bounds) 80 yards 
into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Just 2:33 later, the Chargers took a 14-0 lead on Jerome Oakman's 52-yard 
touchdown scamper, which came on the Chargers' first offensive play of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 28-0 and halftime seconds away, the Falcons tried to save some 
dignity with a fake punt. Upman Phil Stewart took the snap 16 yards for a first 
down, and it appeared the Falcons were rolling. 
</P>
<P>
But defensive back Mike Miller intercepted a Gregg Wilbur pass on the next play 
and returned it 15 yards to the Falcon 46. 
</P>
<P>
From there, quarterback Steve Stenstrom guided the Chargers on a three-play 
scoring drive, capping it with a 25-yard touchdown throw to Kevin Rowe for a 
35-0 lead. That gave El Toro's second- and third-stringers a chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom, who played only the first half, completed eight of 13 passes for 108 
yards and two touchdowns. Oakman rushed for 141 yards and two touchdowns in 13 
carries. JOHN GEIS

KENNEDY RALLIES TO TOP ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shamrocks on the shoulder pads of Kennedy High School's football jerseys 
apparently aren't merely for decoration. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson said his team needed a healthy dose of the luck 
of the Irish Friday night to erase a 10-0 first-half Anaheim lead. They got it 
as Kennedy took a 21-10 nonleague victory over Anaheim at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out to play for the first time in three games tonight," said Olson, 
whose team improved to 1-2. "But we got a couple of lucky big plays to help us 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The first came with 1:19 left in the first half. With the ball on the Anaheim 
13-yard line, Kennedy flooded three receivers into the left side of the end 
zone. None were open, so Kennedy quarterback Russ Clark tucked the ball away 
and scooted past cornerback Sammy Valdivia for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
With the ball at the Anaheim 28 during Kennedy's first possession of the second 
half, Kennedy tailback Vince Church took a flea-flicker from Clark, and his 
high lob wobbled down into the hands of receiver Craig Roah at the five. Roah 
head-faked his way into the end zone from there to give Kennedy a 14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy scored again in the fourth quarter, when Clark arched a 51-yard bomb to 
flanker James Chun, who beat Ryan Jones and went into the end zone untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim (0-3) took advantage of Clark's first-quarter fumble to set up its 
first score, a 36-yard field goal by Art Palamares. The Colonists stretched the 
lead to 10-0 later in the first quarter when halfback Sammy Serna punched his 
way over right tackle from a yard out. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a converted running back, completed eight of 16 passes for 140 yards. 
Chun had two catches for 85 yards. Kennedy tailback Ed Williams gained 90 yards 
in 14 carries.

BAILEY'S DEBUT SPARKS FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first appearance of the season, Fullerton High School's John Bailey 
caught a touchdown pass and kicked two field goals to lead the Indians to a 
26-6 victory over Alta Loma in a nonleague football game Friday night in front 
of about 1,500 in Fullerton District Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey had planned to sit out the season and concentrate on baseball, but 
changed his mind three weeks ago and was eligible after taking part in 10 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey kicked a 32-yard field goal with four minutes left in the first quarter 
to put Fullerton ahead, 3-0. John Colvert tied the score with 46 seconds left 
on a 22-yard field goal for Alta Loma. But Fullerton took a 6-3 lead when 
Bailey kicked a 47-yard field goal with time running out in the first half. 
Bailey caught a 15-yard scoring pass from Rene Arias with about five minutes 
left in the third quarter to put Fullerton ahead, 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (3-0) added fourth-quarter touchdowns on a four-yard run by Arias and 
a 28-yard run by Marcus Roberson. Alta Loma is 2-1.

SADDLEBACK'S FIRST VICTORY IS A SHUTOUT; 
</P>
<P>
EL RANCHO DOES NOT COMPLETE PASS, HELD TO 98 YARDS IN OFFENSE

<P>
Saddleback High is no longer winless in high school football, thanks to a 12-0 
victory Friday night over El Rancho High of Pico Rivera in front of 2,500 at 
the loser's field. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two weeks we were forced to play catch-up," said Saddleback coach 
Jerry Witte. "In both games, we were down 14 points by halftime." 
</P>
<P>
But the Roadrunners (1-2) needed just four plays before their defense asserted 
itself against the Dons, last year's Division IV runner-up. El Rancho (1-2) ran 
the ball three times on the game's opening possession, then attempted a punt. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback's defense got to kicker Keith Garcia first, Victor Davis blocking 
the kick and Bobby Collins gathering in the ball at the five and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
That from the defense that had surrendered 45 points in Saddleback's first two 
games of the season -- 24-7 to Ocean View and 21-0 to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
That same defense held El Rancho to 98 yards in total offense and kept Art 
Rodriguez, the Dons' starting quarterback, from completing a pass in seven 
attempts. His only completion of the night (14 yards to Juan Quintana) was 
nullified by a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the same defense that intercepted Rodriguez once, sacked him once 
and picked off his back-up, Jim Arellanes, late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
But the defense wasn't the only operative Saddleback unit. Its offense amassed 
225 yards, with J.J. Fejeran getting 78 yards of it on 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Paul Delgado passed for 102 yards, completing 9 of 14 with 
one touchdown and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown pass covered 28 yards to Juan Acuna, midway through the second 
quarter to give Saddleback a 12-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to take the pressure off him (Delgado) by running the ball," Witte 
said. "And I think we did a good job.

<P>
Maldonado, who carried 12 times, scored San Clemente's touchdown on a 19-yard

SANTA MARGARITA RALLIES TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Josh Ireland gained 158 yards in 21 carries and scored two 
touchdowns as Santa Margarita High School overcame a 12-3 deficit in the second 
half for a 23-12 victory over host Harvard Friday night in nonleague play in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland scored on runs of 17 and 53 yards as Santa Margarita defeated its first 
varsity opponent in the school's three-year history and improved to 2-1. Last 
week, Santa Margarita defeated Jurupa Valley's junior varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Trevor Yankoff completed six of 18 passes for 126 yards and scored 
on a two-yard keeper in the fourth quarter to finish Santa Margarita's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande 16, Pioneer 14 -- Quarterback Sonny Nguyen ran for a touchdown, 
passed for another, kicked a 32-yard field goal and the extra points in the 
Matadors' victory at home over winless Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 14-10, Bolsa Grande (2-1) took the second-half kickoff and drove 70 
yards for the winning touchdown, a 29-yard pass from Nguyen to wide receiver 
Trent Wood. After that, two Matador fumbles helped to quiet Bolsa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna 21, Cypress 0 -- Quarterback Kenison PoChing scored two touchdowns in 
the second half as Savanna snapped an 11-game losing streak spanning two 
seasons with a victory at Western. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna's last victory was over Garden Grove, 12-7, in its season opener last 
year. The Rebels are 1-2 this year. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena 28, Warren 0 -- Junior quarterback Adam Garcia passed for 160 yards 
and one touchdown and ran for another to lead visiting El Modena High School 
past Warren. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory in three games for the Vanguards, who built a 21-0 
lead by halftime. Warren is 1-2. The tone was set on the opening drive, when El 
Modena used 15 plays to go 59 yards, scoring on Garcia's 1-yard run with 3:48 
left in the quarter. Garcia, 12 for 18 on the night, hit four of six passes for 
48 yards on that drive. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, tailback Ryan Ogden's 19-yard scoring run completed a 
59-yard drive that put the Vanguards ahead 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
They only had to go 34 yards for their third touchdown, after a short punt by 
Warren. Reserve tailback Tom Mazzone scored from one yard out with 2:53 left in 
the half for a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The only score of the second half was a 52-yard pass from Garcia to tight end 
Graham Brown on the first play of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Norco 35, Pacifica 21 -- Host Norco had 519 yards and 390 rushing. One bright 
spot for Pacifica was quarterback Bobby Anderson, who was 13 of 19 passing for 
314 yards, one touchdown and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica was down 14-0 in the first quarter when Chris Shockley picked up 
teammate Brett Clark's fumble on Norco's kickoff and ran 75 yards for the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
In eight-man football: 
</P>
<P>
Ribet Academy 50, Claremont 22 -- Host Claremont cut the lead to 28-22 early in 
the fourth quarter but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
Ribet had a fourth and 15 on its 32 early in the fourth quarter when 
quarterback Kiesh Henderon broke a 20-yard run to keep the drive going. 
Henderson scored four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Perkins had 93 yards in carries for Claremont.

TRABUCO HILLS TRIES TO REBOUND AGAINST WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trabuco Hills High School, coming off only its third loss in the past two 
seasons, will play host to Long Beach Wilson in a nonleague game at noon today 
at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills, the defending Division VIII champion, was upset, 14-7, last week 
by Dana Hills. Trabuco Hills failed to score in the final two minutes after 
gaining a first down on Dana Hills' five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second-lowest point total for Trabuco Hills since it lost to 
Laguna Beach, 9-7, last season. Junior fullback Ben Rooker is the team's top 
offensive threat, rushing for 253 yards in 35 carries and scoring four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Wilson (1-1) is led by center-linebacker Buster Layton, who has 
helped the Bruins limit opponents to an average of 12.5 points per game. Wilson 
is the first Division-I team that Trabuco Hills has played in its history. 
</P>
<P>
In other games, surprising Servite will play host to Taft at 7:30 p.m. in 
Glover Stadium. Servite quarterback Rob Walker established a school record last 
week by passing for 371 yards in a 45-28 loss to Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos will play Norte Vista at Riverside City College and La Quinta 
will play at Western.

Refugees who fled the violent suppression of China's pro-democracy movement 
joined fellow Chinese from around the world Friday to establish a new 
opposition in exile aimed at continuing the battle begun on Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting of the Federation for Democracy in China, held at the 
Sorbonne, opened with a moment of silence to honor those killed June 3-4 when 
soldiers marched into Beijing to crush the student-led movement. Hundreds, and 
perhaps thousands, died. 
</P>
<P>
"Bringing democracy to China requires that we battle together, shoulder to 
shoulder," said Wuer Kaixi, the 21-year-old Beijing University student who 
delivered compelling speeches in Beijing's Tian An Men Square at the height of 
the spring protests. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in the crowd of about 500 were photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, 
actor Yves Montand, political leaders and human rights activists from 
throughout Europe and four members of Poland's once-banned Solidarity movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We Poles know the cost of freedom, human rights. Fighting for these things 
takes a long time," Solidarity member Zbigniew Chlap told the crowd.

Delegates to the meeting were divided into four regional groups -- China, 
Europe, Asia and North America.

COSTA MESA MAN ACCUSED IN SCHEME TO LAUNDER MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa businessman, suspected of operating a fraudulent 
multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme from his Santa Ana office, appeared in federal 
court in Los Angeles Friday after his arrest on charges of laundering drug 
money and avoiding financial reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Manuel de la Jara, who as president of American Investment &amp; Finance 
Group used the alias Jose Ojar Fernandez, is being held at the Metropolitan 
Detention Center in Los Angeles pending a detention hearing scheduled Tuesday 
in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Carlton said the money-laundering charges stemmed 
from an undercover investigation in which "an agent represented to Mr. de la 
Jara that certain monies were proceeds of narcotics transactions, and (de la 
Jara) was alleged to have taken those monies and given back to the agent checks 
drawn on various bank accounts." 
</P>
<P>
The money-laundering charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and 
a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The second charge states that de la Jara illegally structured his financial 
transactions to avoid federal laws that require the reporting of any 
transaction of more than $10,000. That charge carries a maximum penalty of five 
years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
De la Jara is also suspected by federal investigators of running a Ponzi 
scheme, in which investors are paid off with money provided by an expanding 
circle of new investors rather than with the proceeds of investments. He is 
wanted by Interpol, the international police coordinating agency, for alleged 
criminal activities in Peru, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the documents relating to the investigation of American Investment 
remain sealed, and the exact relationship between the alleged Ponzi scheme and 
the other charges against de la Jara could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
A series of searches was carried out Thursday by law enforcement officials at 
several American Investment offices: the old city hall building in Santa Ana; 
5201 E. Olympic Blvd. in East Los Angeles; and 11220 Laurel Canyon Blvd. near 
San Fernando. De la Jara's residence on Tulare Drive in Costa Mesa was also 
raided. 
</P>
<P>
One official, who asked not to be identified, said the company advertised 
heavily in the Spanish language media in search of investors and appeared to 
have taken in about $8 million in deposits from 800 mostly Latino investors. At 
its peak, the operation was taking in nearly $2 million a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the company appeared to have real estate holdings worth about $3.5 
million, it also had outstanding trust deeds -- which were provided to 
investors as collateral -- valued at three times that amount, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
American Investment, whose assets have been placed in receivership by the 
California Department of Corporations, promised investors returns of 22% on 
minimum investments of $1,000, and they were provided with trust deeds, 
semiprecious gems or promissory notes as collateral, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the red flags were there that this was a Ponzi scheme that was about to 
collapse, so rather than wait, we tried to step in and hopefully protect some 
of these investors," he added.

WHO SAW THE FATEFUL CRASH?; 
</P>
<P>
CHP FRUSTRATED BY LACK OF WITNESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The accident involved a spectacular, high-speed collision on Santiago Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
In heavy rain, a pickup truck had collided Tuesday near Peters Canyon Road with 
a subcompact car, critically injuring the young female driver and inflicting 
deep cuts on the truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
But when California Highway Patrol officers converged on the scene to 
investigate, they could not find a witness, even though the collision had 
occurred during the morning rush hour at a time when the two-lane road was so 
congested that a 10-mile traffic backup ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Someone reported the 7:20 a.m. accident by cellular telephone, prompting a 
quick response by paramedics and law enforcement officers. But the absence of 
any witnesses to describe what happened and verify who was at fault has left 
CHP officers angry and disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's typical. No one wants to get involved," said CHP Officer Mike Lundquist. 
"These people are all racing to work and they figure it's not them. It's not 
their job." 
</P>
<P>
The woman lies in a coma at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, with her 
family maintaining an around-the-clock vigil at her bedside. Nichole Garcia, 
22, of Trabuco Canyon suffered skull fractures and has been on life-support 
systems since the accident. She was on her way to her new job as an instructor 
at a preschool when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup, Ernesto Elisalde, 19, of La Puente, was treated and 
released at United Western Medical Center for head bruises and side injuries. 
se 
</P>
<P>
Elisalde told authorities that the left front tire of his 1983 Mazda pickup 
blew out and he slammed on the brakes. Elisalde, a painter who was heading to 
his job, said the next thing he remembered after the accident was sitting on a 
curb. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of witnesses, CHP Officer Wally Seibert, theorized that, based 
on the point of impact between the passenger side of the pickup and the front 
end of Garcia's westbound 1981 Toyota Celica, the pickup veered left into 
oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
From the damage, Seibert estimated the speed of the pickup at 45 m.p.h. and the 
speed of Toyota at 55 m.p.h. Because of the rain-slicked asphalt, there were no 
skid marks -- usually a reliable gauge of speed. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his 20 years in law enforcement, Seibert, 47, said he is "almost 
positive" that the reconstruction is accurate and that Elisalde, not Garcia, 
was at fault. No citations have been issued pending the completion of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But without eyewitnesses, Seibert said he cannot be certain. Seibert has 
visited the accident site twice this week in hopes someone who saw the 
collision would stop and talk. No one did. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of witnesses is to verify the fact that this is in fact the way 
it did happen, and that the girl wasn't doing anything wrong," Seibert said. 
"If the girl was wrong, then I should change my report." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses are important as insurers attempt to decide how to assess the costs 
of the accident. Elisalde's statement may not be used against him should a 
civil lawsuit be filed, Seibert said. That leaves only the officer's guess of 
who was at fault, a fact which he said could be exploited if the incident 
triggers a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Although this is not the first time the CHP has investigated a traffic accident 
in which no witnesses came forward, Seibert said it is unusual in a collision 
so severe, with so many onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it hard to believe that nobody can be a witness," he said. "We have one 
near-fatal. We have another victim with a major head injury. Both vehicles are 
totaled. And here we sit with no one coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's family is also incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable that they didn't," Garcia's mother, Sylvia Garcia of Trabuco 
Canyon, said as she and other family members waited outside the intensive-care 
ward at United Western Medical Center on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope someone will come forward and shed some light," added David Garcia 
of Walnut, the victim's father. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Garcia said her daughter had just moved to Trabuco Canyon from the 
Montebello area shortly before the crash. She is engaged to be married and had 
just begun a job at a preschool in Garden Grove, after having worked as a 
secretary since high school. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Fernandez, an uncle with whom the pretty young woman was staying, said that 
he remembered Garcia walking out the door for work that morning in an upbeat 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was fine," Fernandez said, "other than the rain."

SANTA ANA AGENTS SAY THEY MAKE ONLY A DENT ON DRUG TRADE 
</P>

<P>
It didn't take long for "Javier," an undercover Santa Ana police officer, to 
buy cocaine in the Fairview Villas Apartment Complex on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes after entering the sprawling complex on Fairview Street, Javier was 
approached by a wiry man who emerged from the shadows of a parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me what I wanted," said the undercover officer who often uses the 
alias Javier during drug busts. "I told him I wanted blanca" -- the Spanish 
street name for cocaine. The man returned a short time later with a square, 
plastic bag filled with white powder, and Javier paid him $20. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, four uniformed police officers jumped out of two squad cars, 
pinned the suspected drug pusher to a wall and handcuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what was happening to me," Abraham Contreras Alcarez, 30, of 
Santa Ana said while being processed Friday afternoon for allegedly selling a 
quarter-gram of cocaine to the undercover officer. Alcarez was taken to Orange 
County Central Jail, where he was being held on an unspecified amount of bail 
Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's sweeps of the Fairview Villas were prompted by complaints from the 
owner of a nearby day-care center that the apartment complex is a bustling 
center for drug sales and use. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young pledged to crack down on the 562-unit apartment complex 
after Dorothy L. Davis, who operates the Pride Development County day-care 
center on Sullivan Street, complained to the City Council Monday night that 
police have been unable to stop the drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Drug transactions are conducted openly in the maze-like alleys of the huge 
apartment complex, she told the council. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour meeting on Thursday, Young and Police Chief Paul Walters 
announced that officers would focus attention on the complex and boost the 
daily patrols. 
</P>
<P>
The narcotics squad was out in force at the Fairview Villas Friday, but several 
sweeps of the apartment complex resulted in only two arrests on drug charges, 
said Detective Sgt. Brad Messmer, who heads the squad's "buy team" -- a group 
of four undercover officers who purchase drugs from sellers before uniformed 
officers follow and make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested on suspicion of selling a controlled substance was Jose Luis 
Santana, 19, of Santa Ana. He told police that he came to the United States 
from Mexico six weeks ago to join his family. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeps lasted until 5 p.m., Messmer said, and will continue throughout the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Messmer said he understood the frustration of residents and local business 
owners such as Davis. But, he added, many of them do not see the work of the 
undercover 
</P>
<P>
officers who patrol the Fairview Villas and other "hot spots" every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see her side of it," Messmer said. "But I don't agree that we aren't 
doing everything possible about (eradication). They want (drug sales) stopped. 
I agree with that. But you can't keep cops there on the street 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
Messmer said the narcotics squad is grossly undermanned, and until there are 
more undercover officers, street sales of marijuana and narcotics will continue 
largely unchecked in Santa Ana. There are about a dozen locations in the city 
where motorists pull up to dealers standing on street corners and purchase 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"(Santa Ana) is the worst in Orange County," Messmer said Friday as he 
coordinated the series of small sweeps into the complex. "We have to spread 
ourselves real thin." 
</P>
<P>
Police efforts are also stymied because dealers who are arrested often return 
to the streets quickly on bail or after a short jail term, Messmer said. Also, 
"if we bust one, there's always someone else to take his place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Messmer lays much of the blame for the city's drug problems on the recreational 
users who come by the hundreds each day from other, more affluent cities to buy 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's well known that you can come here and buy anything," Messmer said. "If we 
can just dry up the demand, this would slow down." 
</P>
<P>
The buyers take advantage of the ease with which drugs are purchased at 
low-income apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way for them to make money," Messmer said of the street dealers that 
stand sometimes elbow-to-elbow waiting for drive-by sales. 
</P>
<P>
Alcarez, who admitted that he sold drugs to the undercover officer, said he did 
so because he was suffering severe financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
He said that several weeks ago he took an air compressor and spray gun from the 
metal finishing plant where he works. He pawned the equipment to a friend for 
$100 but needed to raise money to reclaim the equipment and return it to his 
employer by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I just needed the money real bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several tenants living in the sprawling apartment complex applauded 
the sweeps and said they hope that police will eventually make their 
neighborhood free of drug-related activity. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them said they live in fear of being robbed, burglarized or harassed by 
drug users and dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is very bad," 18-year-old Monica Martinez said in Spanish. "The 
cars come driving in front of my apartment all night."

'NO QUICK FIX' SEEN IN BATTLING GROWING SWARMS OF ASH WHITEFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agriculture officials and entomologists said Friday that there is "no quick 
fix" to countering the growing swarms of ash whiteflies in Orange County and 
other parts of Southern California, but the pesky insects could eventually be 
controlled through predators and parasites. 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the California Agricultural Commissioners and Sealers Assn. 
subcommittee on the ash whitefly in Anaheim, Orange County Agricultural 
Commissioner James D. Harnett urged tormented homeowners not to spray 
pesticides in an attempt to kill the flies that have recently infested their 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't work very well and it's not a good idea," Harnett told reporters 
after the meeting Friday. "There is no quick fix. It is a matter of controlling 
the flies, not eradication." 
</P>
<P>
Harnett said he understands why residents in Southern California are upset with 
the infestation of the flying insect, which is about the size of the head of a 
pin. The flies are so numerous in places that people can no longer hold 
gatherings in their back yards, Harnett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduction Expected 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, the ash whitefly will never be eradicated completely, and 
residents should get used to it. Harnett said that when control programs are 
under way the number of the flies will be reduced considerably. 
</P>
<P>
The fly hangs on the underside of the leaves of ash trees and ornamental pear 
trees. There it eats the leaves and lays its eggs. Although the insect was 
spotted for the first time only last year, Harnett said September and October 
seem to be the worst months for the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bellows, UC Riverside associate professor of entomology, said officials 
are studying predators and parasites that are successfully used in Europe and 
Israel to control the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
One of the predators, similar to the orange lady bug but small and bronze 
colored, eats the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of next year, Bellows said he hoped to be ready to release 
whatever predators or parasites that will control the pest and yet not pose a 
danger to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bellows advised residents to keep the trees that the whiteflies 
infest well watered and be prepared for the leaves to drop off a little sooner 
than usual.

DRIVER OF DEATH CAR GETS 25 YEARS TO LIFE FOR RIDING OVER MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dallas Keith Carter, 19, shook in his chair Friday as a Superior Court judge 
sentenced him to 25 years to life in prison for killing a young man by driving 
his car over him three times. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan, who noted that the victim's bones could be 
heard to crack on the pass over the body, discounted Carter's testimony that he 
later thought he might have run over a speed bump. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know speed bumps don't make a sound like 'crack,' " the judge said in a 
Santa Ana courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, a resident of Costa Mesa, was convicted by a jury two months ago of 
first-degree murder in the May 15, 1988, death of 26-year-old Javier G. Sarabia 
of Garden Grove. The victim had been riding home on a motorcycle with his 
brother, Alex, from a family barbecue when Carter and two friends began 
tailgating them, then chased them and confronted them not far from their home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Witnesses Described Action 
</P>
<P>
After a scuffle, in which Sarabia was knocked to the ground, Carter and his two 
companions jumped into their car and drove toward him. Other witnesses in the 
area said Carter made a U-turn with the car and ran over Sarabia at least three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, the three had harassed two other people and Carter had 
even fired a gun in what Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson described as 
"a night of random assault just for the heck of it." 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional statement to the court, the victim's father, Hector Sarabia, 
exclaimed in tears: "Why my son? I ask myself a thousand times, why my boy?" 
</P>
<P>
Sarabia said he did not want revenge. "We just want society to be free of these 
types of people. For me, he (Carter) doesn't have no name. He's just a 
criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Sarabia's emotion-charged statement became so loud that he finished by 
apologizing: "I'm sorry for disturbing the peace of this court." 
</P>
<P>
Carter's lawyers had claimed that Carter was too drunk to form an intent to 
commit first-degree murder, but Judge Ryan disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Forgetful When Helpful' 
</P>
<P>
During testimony by Carter, the judge said, the defendant was "crystal clear" 
about certain events that night, "but he was forgetful when it was helpful to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Carter's attorneys also asked that Carter's sentence be reduced from the 
standard 25-year-to-life sentence for first-degree murder because the two other 
men with him that night had served just seven months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The two men in the car with Carter -- Ernest J. Busto, now 21, of Garden Grove, 
and Sergio Sanchez, now 19, of Santa Ana -- both pleaded guilty to a lesser 
charge of assault with a deadly weapon. They were placed on probation with 
credit given them for the time they already had served in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Roger B. Alexander pointed to court testimony that 
someone in the car other than Carter was heard yelling "hit him again." 
</P>
<P>
The judge responded that while their sentences did not compare to Carter's, 25 
years was not too severe considering what Carter did to the victim. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very heavy case," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander noted Carter's youth in asking for the sentence reduction. He added 
that Carter was an immature young man, not someone with a criminal past. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Robinson countered by noting what he considered Carter's 
"flippant . . . I don't give a rip" attitude on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Come hell or high water, whoever got in his way that night was going to pay," 
Robinson argued.

KILLER CAPTURED IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY AFTER LEAVING OUTPATIENT PROGRAM IS ORDERED 
TO STATE HOSPITAL

A woman who killed her mother and slashed her daughter's throat nine years ago 
was denied a bid Friday to return to a halfway house program similar to one 
from which she disappeared last March. 
</P>
<P>
Arlyne Louise Genger, 46, who was arrested last month in Fountain Valley, was 
ordered by Superior Court Judge James M. Coleman in Van Nuys to return to 
Patton State Hospital, the San Bernardino psychiatric facility from which she 
won her freedom in June, 1988, after a court determined that she had been 
rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
Genger had been living in Gateway Hospital, an outpatient community treatment 
program in Los Angeles. She disappeared from the facility in March after 
getting permission to go to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said she went to Las Vegas and lost most of her money gambling, 
then found work in Orange County as a telephone saleswoman. She was arrested 
last month as she went to pick up her paycheck after quitting her job. Genger 
was traced when she applied for a driver's license under her real name, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Release 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her disappearance, Genger had unsuccessfully petitioned the 
court several times to be released from the facility and allowed to live in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Genger was declared not guilty by reason of insanity after she admitted 
stabbing her mother more than 20 times and cutting her daughter's throat and 
wrist with a razor in the family's North Hollywood apartment on New Year's Day, 
1980. Genger's daughter, Selena, then 13, survived the attack. Her mother did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Goldberg, Gateway's program director, advocated Genger's return to 
Patton, saying Genger is hostile to authority figures and to anyone with whom 
she has a close relationship. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Public Defender Dennis G. Cohen, who represented Genger, asked that 
she be allowed to enter a different halfway house so that she could continue 
treatment with a different therapist. 
</P>
<P>
He said Genger proved by leaving the halfway house that she has been 
rehabilitated. "There is no indication that she involved herself in any 
violations of the law, committed any crimes or hurt any person," Cohen said. 
Instead, Genger proved that she was able to work and function in society. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. James A. Baker said Genger should absolutely not be 
allowed to remain in a halfway facility. 
</P>
<P>
Genger's cousin, Richard Cookston, said after the hearing that Genger's 
daughter and other family members would be relieved by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We as a family do not want to see her out. We want her in there forever," 
Cookston said. He said relatives are hiding from Genger and had feared that she 
might try to find them before her arrest.

COURT HEARS APPEAL OF EX-ACLU OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two-thirds of the way through a prepared talk, speaker Linda Valentino broke 
from remarks on the abuses of police surveillance and abruptly asked a man in 
the audience: "Would you care to comment on that, Officer Long?" 
</P>
<P>
Stunned, participants at the 1980 public conference turned toward the subject 
target of her gibe: Sgt. Richard T. Long, a Newport Beach police community 
relations officer who would later be branded a "spy" by organizers of the 
American Civil Liberties Union event. 
</P>
<P>
Valentino's query eventually led to the police officer's departure from the 
conference -- after what he described as the humiliation and intimidation of 
having been singled out and being the target of verbal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, state appellate justices in Santa Ana were asked to decide 
whether that confrontation was a protected expression of free speech by angered 
ACLU members or a clear case of discrimination in excluding a police officer 
from a public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In oral arguments before the 4th District Court of Appeal, attorneys for 
Valentino, a former board member in the Southern California chapter of the 
organization, and former ACLU staff attorney Rees Lloyd, who also was at the 
1980 meeting, implored the court to overturn the award made in Orange County 
Superior Court in 1987 in favor of Long. The appellate court did not rule on 
the matter. Long won a $20,000 judgment in the Superior Court trial, and the 
court had later ordered the ACLU of Southern California to pay Long about 
$72,000 in legal expenses. Last year, the group paid Long $35,000 to settle its 
portion of the claim, marking the first time that the champion of civil 
liberties had ever paid damages to settle a violation of rights claim against 
it. But Valentino and Lloyd, who as individuals were co-defendants in the suit, 
broke ranks with the ACLU and decided to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In court Friday, their attorneys painted the case as nothing less than a 
critical test of citizens' right to stand up to Big Brother and express 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that it happens to be a public meeting doesn't mean that the 
government can sit there among us and record what we say and do," argued Hugh 
Manes, the attorney for Lloyd. Manes maintained that Long "tried to sneak into" 
the publicly advertised meeting, perhaps in an attempt to "distort" 
participants' comments in a report back to Newport Beach police. Manes also 
argued that the presence of unannounced police officers or other government 
officials at meetings, even public ones, amounts to government surveillance and 
could have a "chilling effect" on open discussion. 
</P>
<P>
But his argument drew open skepticism from Associate Justice Thomas F. Crosby 
Jr. Crosby suggested that by Manes' reasoning, police officers could be barred 
from a host of public places or meetings. "How's a policeman supposed to know 
what public meetings he can go to?" Crosby said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the claim that the defendants were merely exercising their 
rights to free speech, Crosby said later: "You didn't say" to Long that " 
'you're a lousy scumbag policeman and I hate all of you'; you said, 'Get out of 
the meeting.' " 
</P>
<P>
Long has acknowledged that he was acting in an official capacity, on 
instructions from the police chief and with approval for overtime pay, when he 
attended the ACLU Legislative Conference on Oct. 11, 1980, in Newport Beach. He 
paid a fee, but he did not sign the conference register. 
</P>
<P>
Long, who was wearing street clothes, took about 10 pages of notes and 
tape-recorded portions of the discussions throughout the day, according to 
testimony at the trial. He said that the reason he attended and was recording 
the sessions was that he was trying to get a better idea of the community's 
concerns about law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, which came shortly after a public outcry over police spying in 
Los Angeles and elsewhere, became heated after Valentino made Long's presence 
known to the group. Several participants demanded to know what the officer was 
doing at the conference. After a verbal confrontation with Lloyd, Long left. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU officials maintain that although they loudly voiced their displeasure 
about the officer's presence, he was never explicitly ordered to leave or 
forcibly removed the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But Long testified at the Superior Court trial: "It was just awful. These 
people are shouting things at you. You got people sticking their finger in your 
face. You got accusations. . . . I was incensed by what they'd done, and I 
mean, I had this vision of my career crashing and burning. 
</P>
<P>
"I was embarrassed. I was humiliated by these people. You got all these people 
sitting there looking at you like you done something wrong. . . . I wanted out 
of there. I wanted to go home." 
</P>
<P>
Long's attorney, Jeffrey M. Epstein, argued in court Friday that the ACLU 
members at the conference were in effect engaged in "a conspiracy . . . to try 
and embarrass and drive Richard Long from there." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 trial verdict, Lloyd was held liable for about $46,000 in damages 
to Long, and Valentino for $4,100. Valentino said that if the verdict is 
upheld, the ACLU will pay her share of the damages. But the money is not the 
issue, Valentino said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the principle," she said after Friday's arguments were heard. "If the 
court upholds this verdict, it's the first time someone has been held liable 
for civil damages for exercising protected speech to a government official."

TITANS' DEFENSE PLANNING A RUSH PARTY AGAINST SAN DIEGO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lesson of the week for Cal State Fullerton's defense has been the pass 
rush. The test is tonight, when the Titans take on San Diego State and Dan 
McGwire, the Aztecs' 6-foot-8 quarterback, at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, brother of Oakland Athletics' first baseman Mark McGwire, has been 
sacked only twice in two games and has passed for 647 yards. Fullerton has yet 
to face a quarterback of his ability this season, and certainly not one of his 
stature. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy jokes that it would take Fullerton basketball 
players just to get a hand in McGwire's face. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Spielbuehler, the defensive line coach, is more straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope we can get to him," Spielbuehler said. 
</P>
<P>
This is Fullerton's last chance for a victory against a Division I team in its 
four-game nonconference schedule. After three games, the Titans are 1-2, the 
only victory over Division II Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The consolation for the Titans is that they play their first Big West 
Conference game next Saturday. As poorly as Fullerton has done in nonconference 
games in recent years, the Titans have remained competitive in the conference 
-- which is good for the Titans but not flattering for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State (0-2) is just trying to get a victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were embarrassed in in their season-opening 52-36 loss to Air Force, 
then just missed upsetting UCLA last week when the Bruins scored in the final 
three minutes to win, 28-25. 
</P>
<P>
To the Aztecs, Fullerton looks like a victory waiting to be won. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks we will win (this) football game," San Diego State Coach Al 
Luginbill said. "I just want to win a football game. We need to sing our fight 
song in the locker room, which is what we do when we win. We know it; we just 
haven't had a chance to sing it." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State still puzzles some observers after two games, but not Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"People say UCLA is down," Murphy said. "I think San Diego State is up." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has struggled with mistakes in its first three games. The Titans 
turned over the ball seven times in a 42-14 loss to Colorado State last week, 
and are minus-eight in turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan Speltz particularly has struggled, throwing nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've played hard, but we've made so many mistakes," Murphy said. "I 
just hope we improve as a football team." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton hasn't had much success getting to opposing quarterbacks this season, 
in part because the Titans have faced some scramblers. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has four sacks in three games. 
</P>
<P>
John Bavaro, the Fullerton nose guard who signed at San Diego State out of 
community college but never played a game there, is the team's leading tackler 
for losses with six. 
</P>
<P>
Bavaro knows McGwire presents a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"You've just got to get in there," Bavaro said. "He's too tall for you to block 
his passes. You've got to get his mind off throwing. You have to get him 
worried about getting hit." 
</P>
<P>
Bavaro also knows there are some Aztec players who remember his sudden 
departure for personal reasons in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"People need something to focus on during a game," he said. "It's gonna be me, 
I think." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State has dominated the series against Fullerton, winning all three 
meetings by a combined score of 120-45. The most lopsided victory was 59-14 in 
1975. The Aztecs also defeated Fullerton in '76 and '77. . . . Dan McGwire's 
Claremont High School coach was Bob Baiz Sr., father of Fullerton reserve 
safety Bob Baiz. . . . Fullerton is 3-14 against Western Athletic Conference 
teams, all on the road. The victories are against Hawaii, Wyoming and Colorado 
State. . . . Fullback Tim Byrnes has taken over as the starting tight end, 
beating out Bill Brennan and Mike Kent.

UCI, SOVIET SCHOOL PROPOSE JOINT MBA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bringing profit to the land of perestroika -- where President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's reform policies have barely begun to penetrate the Soviet Union's 
cumbersome bureaucracy -- will be no easy task. 
</P>
<P>
But it is one that Dennis Aigner, dean of the UCI Graduate School of 
Management, is looking forward to. 
</P>
<P>
Aigner, in what would be the first program of its kind, is proposing to 
establish a joint two-year graduate program for students from UC Irvine and 
Moscow State University. 
</P>
<P>
The students would spend a year in each country learning techniques to use in 
operating the kinds of joint Soviet-American business ventures cropping up 
under the new freedom that glasnost -- openness -- has meant in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Irvine students, Aigner said, would get a close look at just how the 
Soviet system works, and the Soviets would be exposed to such un-Marxist ideas 
as profit, marketing and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Intended for Young 
</P>
<P>
Although there are already a number of Soviet-U.S. exchange programs, the one 
envisioned by Aigner and his Moscow State University counterpart, Oleg 
Vihanskiy, head of the school's new Department of Management, would be the only 
one to award an MBA accredited by a major U.S. university. 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering a joint MBA, the UC Irvine-Moscow State University program 
would also be the first intended for what Aigner called "the young ones" -- 
students just completing undergraduate studies, rather than for experienced 
managers who may have deeply ingrained habits. 
</P>
<P>
Aigner said he and Vihanskiy want the program to develop a generation of 
"outward-thinking" Soviets who will enter their nation's management system and 
energize its notoriously stodgy bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement for a two-year Soviet-American MBA program was worked out by 
Aigner and Vihanskiy during a recent 16-day study trip to the Soviet Union made 
by Aigner and four Orange County business executives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviet Inquiries 
</P>
<P>
Aigner actually began working on the idea nine months ago, when he learned that 
a delegation of Soviet academics was in San Francisco and inquiring about 
academic exchange programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I intercepted them and flew them to Irvine and we began talking," Aigner said. 
The idea of a joint graduate degree program was first raised in March, he said, 
when an important Soviet economist was visiting UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Aigner said the program must be approved by the UC Irvine curriculum committee 
and also that the Graduate School of Management must find the money to pay for 
the program. The only costs associated with the program would be paying the 
expenses of the Soviet students during their year at Irvine (the agreement 
calls for the Soviets to cover the expenses of the UC Irvine students during 
their year in Moscow). 
</P>
<P>
Aigner said he envisions an enrollment of about 20 students a year, 10 from 
each school. He estimates the cost of supporting the Soviet students would be 
about $120,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are dozens of local companies involved in trade with the 
Soviet Union, Aigner said he hopes corporations will contribute money for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has not yet begun pitching the program to officials at UC Irvine but 
that he does not anticipate problems because the cost would be minimal. It will 
be "embedded" in the regular MBA program and therefore will not require 
additional instructors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Agreements 
</P>
<P>
Should the program be approved, Aigner said, the first classes will probably 
meet in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the MBA program proposal, Aigner also brought back from his 
Soviet trip a series of agreements with officials of other bodies. The Soviet 
All-Union Economic Society and the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of the 
USA and Canada made agreements for annual student and faculty member exchanges 
and for periodic study tours of the Soviet Union to be made by UC Irvine 
students and local business executives.

FIDELITY NATIONAL SAYS IT MAY MAKE OFFER; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE FIRM CONSIDERS BID ON HAMMOND CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four months after buying a large chunk of the Hammond Co., a Newport Beach 
mortgage banking firm, Fidelity National Financial Inc. said Friday that it 
will consider launching a tender offer for the company. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine title company, which recently increased its stake in Hammond to 
23.6%, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it is seeking 
ways to maximize shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
Officers at both public companies could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In May, after Fidelity spent more than $1.5 million to acquire its initial 
16.3% stake in Hammond, a Fidelity executive said his firm would consider 
buying more stock but did not intend to turn its purchases into a takeover 
attempt or a "hostile situation." 
</P>
<P>
But in the SEC filing, the Irvine firm said it is reviewing Hammond's policies 
and business practices and plans to submit its own business strategies to 
Hammond's board. The firm also said it may buy more stock or even launch a 
tender offer for the rest of the mortgage banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
In the last month, Fidelity spent $162,443 to buy 38,222 shares in six 
transactions ranging from $4 a share to $4.25 a share, the SEC filing states. 
</P>
<P>
Independent mortgage banking operations generally are good buys because their 
stock has been undervalued, said Lawrence Butler, a senior vice president at 
Newport Securities Corp. brokerage in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, a regional firm, also would make a particularly good fit for Fidelity, 
another regional firm, because the title insurer could feed off the real estate 
loans Hammond makes to sell its title policies, Butler said. "Hammond is a 
good-size company, has been in Orange County a long time and has had a very 
good name, a very respected name, in the community for some time," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
The mortgage banker lost $1.1 million in its fiscal year that ended March 31 
and $513,000 in its fiscal first quarter that ended June 30. The firm 
attributed the losses to reduced sales of loan servicing rights, fewer new 
loans, lower interest income and a $450,000 write-off related to its failed bid 
to buy Mission Savings &amp; Loan in Riverside.

STAINED GLASS GROWING IN POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL, Nancy Jo Hill is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Van Dyke knew precisely what he wanted to do first to the Irvine 
townhouse he bought two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor's house where he had grown up had "this beautiful stained glass. . . 
. I remembered the window. I had loved it as a child." 
</P>
<P>
And his new home had a nondescript, 2-by-4-foot window. 
</P>
<P>
So he sought out stained-glass artisan Gretchen McKay and together they 
incorporated his memories into a glowing jewel of a window that is a mixture of 
soft blue and lavender glass accents around an oval of iridescent glass. The 
glass sparkles like an opal and reflects a rainbow of colors. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Wright, meanwhile, wanted to add a special personal touch to the 
5,800-square-foot, Southwest-style home she and her husband, Donald, built in 
the hills of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
"We like Mexico. We like Hawaii. We like the tropical feeling," Wright says. "I 
kind of wanted the feel of Acapulco." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what she has in the stained-glass windows at the front of her house. 
</P>
<P>
Tall glass sidelights on each side of the double oak doors in Wright's entryway 
are curved at the top to match the doors. They depict a tropical lagoon with a 
combination of colored glasses and clear glass textured with a gentle swirl. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, a large red, yellow and blue parrot perches atop a vine above 
banana leaves, bird of paradise and a lagoon of swirling shades of blue and 
green. The other side has more banana plant leaves, yellow flowers and a 
lagoon. Two small bathroom windows carry out the theme in opaque, colored 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke and Wright have joined a growing Orange County trend -- using stained 
glass and clear, textured leaded glass to personalize homes. 
</P>
<P>
These custom works of art are being used in entryways, skylights, dropped 
ceilings in kitchens and bathrooms and in stairwell windows. They are being 
used to reduce sun damage by filtering sunlight from raked windows against 
cathedral ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
They are being used as insets in kitchen cabinet doors, windows in kitchens, 
bathrooms and family rooms and to provide privacy when odd-shaped windows or 
placement of windows defy the use of conventional window coverings. And they 
are being used to enhance views or even obscure views that are unappealing. 
</P>
<P>
Almost any windows -- including casements, crank-outs and double-hung windows 
-- can be changed to stained or leaded glass. 
</P>
<P>
First, a custom design is created for a particular window. Next, glasses are 
selected from hundreds of choices of manufactured glasses that might be 
colored, clear or textured. 
</P>
<P>
Then, individual pieces are cut and fitted together with lead much the same as 
a jigsaw puzzle is constructed. The window is then puttied to make it 
watertight and fitted into place where it should last as a permanent artwork 
for the life of the house. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not as expensive as one might think. Prices vary from studio to studio 
and depend on the amount of intricate detail in a design, but the going rate 
for a simple design ranges from $50 to $85 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Van Dyke's window, for example, cost less than $500. The more detail a 
design has, however, the higher the cost because it means more labor. Certain 
glasses are also more expensive than others. 
</P>
<P>
"The popularity is growing, very, very fast. It's extremely in vogue. . . . 
When we started in business 14 years ago, we saw that it was quite popular 
then," says Orris Barner of the Glasseye in Orange. Since then, Barner added, 
interest in stained-glass windows has "multiplied time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
Gretchen McKay of Contemporary Stained Glass in Villa Park says, "I'm so busy 
right now I have about six months' minimum work." She is working on designs for 
18 windows in one house, including a skylight of eight 3-foot squares of 
stained glass. The skylight glass will have mother-of-pearl and peach tones and 
will be backlighted with neon. 
</P>
<P>
Barner says leaded glass is popular for two reasons. It's beautiful and it's 
practical. 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, traditional draperies have decreased in popularity and 
stained-glass windows are "a great, great way for people to overcome that, to 
afford themselves privacy or sun control or just a piece of beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Benson of Benson Design Studio Inc. in Anaheim agrees that sometimes 
stained-glass windows must be functional as well as beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we're framing a view and we use very transparent glass. Other times 
we have a very heavy textured glass, either to obscure the view beyond or to 
protect the image inside," says Benson. "If someone has a beautiful hilltop 
ocean view, you're not going to put the bulk of your design right smack in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
McKay says that most of the people she deals with are not interested in 
blocking a view. "They're more interested in enhancing a room," she says. 
</P>
<P>
For some people, however, privacy is an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I just recently did a house down in the Dana Point area that had three windows 
right on the bathtub," says Patrick Shane of Patrick Shane Glass Studio in 
Tustin. "The bottom of the windows was bathtub height . . . People could look 
right in." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners had not used the bathroom, says Shane, who replaced the windows 
with opaque textured glass in a contemporary design; the homeowners can now 
bathe in privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes an installation may require privacy and the opportunity to enjoy a 
beautiful view. In this instance, it's possible to have the best of both worlds 
by using more opaque glass at the bottom of the window and more transparent 
glass toward the top of the window. 
</P>
<P>
In other instances, the homeowner may just want a beautiful window. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it's like a work of art, a picture," Scott Van Dyke says of his 
iridescent window. "The great thing is when the sun comes out and is right on 
it and the colors are real vivid. It's just fantastic. . . . I get a lot of 
pleasure out of it." 
</P>
<P>
He bought his townhouse because the development's white wood buildings with 
patios and latticework fences reminded him of his native New England. The 
window enhances that feeling. It faces a sidewalk and has attracted quite a bit 
of attention. 
</P>
<P>
People just come by, he says, and knock on his door to ask about his window and 
"just say they love it." 
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke has plans to add stained glass to some kitchen cabinets and two small 
windows in his front door. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Mackey was also looking for beauty when she decided on stained glass for 
the lakeside Irvine townhouse she shares with her husband, Wes. 
</P>
<P>
She first fell in love with stained glass when she saw some antique church 
windows at an auction. She had a small panel done in a floral design by her 
front door and then decided to replace a stairwell window. 
</P>
<P>
She worked on the design with Shane, basing the window on a photo of a 
contemporary window in a German church. The result is a window with clear, 
lightly textured glass at the top, followed by clear glass with a heavier 
texture and a geometric design that seems to suggest flowing water with deep 
blues, light green and rust colors. The sound of running water from the home's 
atrium waterfall adds to the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"It lets a lot of light in and yet it gives you privacy," says Mackey. "Once I 
had the one put in the stairwell, I just loved it. I felt so good. It had so 
much warmth. . . . It's not something you would do for every window, but for 
certain areas, it's just right." 
</P>
<P>
The window cost $925, which Mackey feels is reasonable for a work of art that 
is also a permanent window covering. In fact, Mackey is waiting for approval 
from her homeowner's association for another stained-glass window in her 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Wright likes stained glass because "it personalizes your house. . . . To 
me it brings you into the house. It's like something I designed." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the entry doors and bathroom windows, Wright has stained glass 
on her second-story bedroom door, which can be seen from downstairs. A 
half-circle window tops two French doors. The design of a trellis intertwined 
with blue morning glories starts in the half circle and winds its way about 
halfway down the doors. The clear background glass has a slight texture for 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Wright has more glass in her living room and library, where she chose clusters 
of beveled glass on a background of clear and textured leaded glass for 
half-circle windows above French doors and for an octagon window over her 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Bevels are pieces of glass that have been ground and polished into prisms that 
refract light, creating a rainbow of colors. Bevel clusters are several pieces 
of beveled glass leaded together in a design. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, beveled and textured glass without color are more popular than 
colored glass. However, intricate beveled designs are usually much more 
expensive than colored and textured glass. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ashoff, owner of Amethyst Glass in Irvine, says that 90% of his work is 
centered on the bevel. "Our design is usually done in bevels, with the 
background done in clear textures," he says. Sometimes pale, soft colors are 
used on the border of these windows, but heavy color is rarely used in 
Amethyst's designs. 
</P>
<P>
Ashoff believes many people are reluctant to use color because they are 
redecorating sooner and because "most of our clients will move in three to four 
years." He says that an odd color might discourage potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Benson and McKay say most clients are selecting leaded glass without much 
color. "The trend towards non-colored stained glass coordinates with the trend 
towards light-colored wood," McKay says. 
</P>
<P>
Ashoff says a clear leaded-glass skylight with bevels has been Amethyst's most 
difficult project so far. The skylight is a 4-by-12, barrel-shaped dome in a 
Huntington Harbour home. The project took three months to complete because the 
glass had to be painstakingly cut and leaded into a curved shape. The dome has 
no color, but it takes on the color of the sky and sparkles with rainbows as 
sunlight streams through the bevels and 300 lead crystals that adorn the 
skylight. 
</P>
<P>
"As your light conditions change from morning to sundown, you get an 
ever-varying appearance to the glasswork," says Barner. "I've often referred to 
it as art that is alive."

Put in your cool-season vegetable garden: broccoli, spinach, cauliflower and 
cabbage as well as onion sets, garden peas, carrots and beets. 
</P>
<P>
Roses in most areas still have one more fling to come; feed and deeply water 
them now. Watch for mildew, which can be a problem this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
. . . AND GENERAL OCTOBER CARE TIPS 
</P>
<P>
This is the time to start planning your fall garden. Prepare all beds by 
pulling summer annuals and adding organic matter, such as peat moss or redwood 
compost to the soil. Turn over soil, incorporate organic matter, then add a 
balanced granular fertilizer, such as 10-10-5 or 14-14-14. 
</P>
<P>
Start looking in local nurseries for fall annuals such as snap dragons, violas, 
poppies and pansies. Plan and prepare your garden now, but wait until October 
to plant. Fall is a good time to divide all spring-blooming perennials, such as 
alstromerias or campanulas. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the spring-blooming bulbs, such as narcissus or tulips, will be 
available this month. Buy now while the selection is best, but do not plant 
until December. 
</P>
<P>
Store tulips and hyacinths in the refrigerator for at least six weeks before 
planting to ensure proper flower formation. Early fall is the best time to 
start zonal and ivy geranium tip cuttings. Take cuttings from the new growth, 
preferably without bulbs or flowers. Dip the cuttings into a rooting hormone 
and place in perlite. Keep in filtered light and slightly moist until roots 
have formed, then transplant into a well-drained potting soil.

Friday was the official beginning of the fall season. In the north, fall is 
signaled by the changing colors of the shrubs and trees and the appearance of 
storm windows and doors. In Southern California, you know fall has arrived when 
homeowners start painting, cleaning and reorganizing. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hottest reorganizing systems today is closet modules. They are 
available in all sizes, shapes, materials and colors. All of the companies 
listed below will come into a home and provide a free estimate. Prices can vary 
widely depending on the degree of customization. The prices quoted below are 
based on an eight-foot closet space. A spokesman for one company said they have 
been commissioned to install a $10,000 system merely so the customer can store 
her furs.

Back in the '70s, Richard Hipp recalls, there were a dozen or more Orange 
County nurseries specializing in cacti and succulents. But spiraling land costs 
forced others to pack up and move out, making Hipp's Stanton shop the last of a 
breed. 
</P>
<P>
House of Cactus has occupied its spot on Beach Boulevard since 1959 (for 18 
years it was called Black's House of Cactus before the original owner sold to 
Hipp). Outside, a desert mural graces the stucco walls; inside, more than 1,500 
varieties of cacti and succulents are offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In his 12 years running the shop, Hipp has seen some changes in the cactus biz. 
Collecting cacti in the wild is now heavily regulated and in some cases 
forbidden by the federal government; meanwhile, importing cacti and succulents 
for retail sale has also been outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
That means most new specimens must be propagated from seeds or from cuttings. 
Because most cacti grow slowly, it usually takes at least two years before they 
are salable, and even then they are tiny. The popular saguaro, for instance, 
grows about one inch a year. Thus, Hipp said, "large plants are in very short 
supply" -- especially with the recent interest in Southwestern home decor. 
</P>
<P>
Hipp buys many of his plants from wholesale suppliers, but propagates many of 
the rarer and more unusual specimens himself. He works the shop alone, usually 
with an emerald green conure parrot named Mikey perched on his shoulder. His 
wife, a hospital dietitian during the week, helps out on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the store's stock is inexpensive, Hipp also offers a number of 
rare specimens with price tags running into the hundreds of dollars. Collectors 
will pay the premium prices, Hipp said. "It can become quite an obsession." He 
held up one small plant, a brand-new variety with only a few specimens known, 
priced at $175. "If you want to be first," he said, "it is expensive."

ON THE WATERFRONT: SEAFOOD COOKERY MADE SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something different for dinner? 
</P>
<P>
How about sauteed squid? Spaghetti sauce with mussels? Or steamed shrimp? 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to preparing food such as squid, mussels or even the less exotic 
shrimp, many ordinary steak-and-potato cooks are intimidated by these mollusks 
and crustaceans that live beneath the sea. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make biologist and amateur seafood cook Joe Conner toss his 
fish-shaped potholder into the air in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Conner, who teaches biology at National University in Irvine, has come 
up with an unusual seafood cooking class he offers throughout Orange County. 
The class is designed to take the mystery out of seafood cooking by taking the 
mystery out of the delectable creatures themselves. "There is no mystery 
involved," Conner says. "They (students in his class) hold and feel the shrimp. 
They learn that shrimp are crustaceans, related to arthropods, invertebrates 
with jointed feet. That they have so many legs because they use them to swim." 
</P>
<P>
Under Conner's tutelage, students also learn about lobsters, clams and fish. 
And they get to touch and hold each subject. "It makes them feel more confident 
in handling seafood," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, after Conner the biologist has taught his students all about the 
tasty critters from the deep, then Conner the cook demonstrates how to prepare 
a simmering bouillabaisse or seafood chowder. 
</P>
<P>
A new series of Conner's classes, offered by the Newport Beach Parks, Beaches 
and Recreation Department, will begin Oct. 2 at the Oasis Center in Corona del 
Mar. The class will cover crustaceans, fin fish and mollusks and will include a 
session on chowder recipes from around the world. Students will learn about 
seafood ecology and the scientific names of common delicacies. They will also 
learn what parts of the crustaceans, fin fish and mollusks are edible. 
</P>
<P>
While the Newport Beach class is aimed at adults, Conner has offered similar 
cooking classes for children, including preschoolers, through the Dana Point 
Harbor Youth and Group Facility. There is no age limit, he says, but "you have 
to be able to handle a knife and a fork." 
</P>
<P>
Conner's classes usually "start off with shrimp," he says. "Shrimp are the 
least expensive and the easiest to cook. Mollusks -- including mussels, squid 
and clams -- on the other hand, people have to warm up to," he explains. Conner 
recommends buying medium-size shrimp and says you should look for ones that are 
translucent, firm and not crushed. "And there should never be a fishy smell," 
he warns. "No seafood smells fishy when it is fresh." 
</P>
<P>
After teaching his students all about the biology of the shrimp and how to buy 
fresh shrimp, Conner turns his attention to shelling and deveining. "A lot of 
women don't know how to devein a shrimp -- and women still do the bulk of the 
cooking," says Conner, hastening to explain his reference to females, who make 
up the bulk of his classes. 
</P>
<P>
As a biologist, Conner explains that it is not a vein that you are removing 
when you devein a shrimp. "They (his students) think you take out the part from 
under the shrimp, but it is the back part, the intestine . . . that you remove. 
You don't remove the part underneath. Deveining is just a more genteel term 
than removing the guts," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even in classes made up mostly of children, Conner says, students participate 
with enthusiasm and, in the end, are willing to eat the results of their 
culinary efforts. In one recent class in Dana Point, Conner taught a group of 
9-year-olds to fillet and cook a trout. And in another children's class, he 
dissected a squid, then chopped it up and tossed it into an aromatic 
bouillabaisse. 
</P>
<P>
Conner, who says his entire family is made up of "good cooks," began cooking 
when he was working on his Ph.D. at UC San Diego. "I began cooking to distract 
me and to overcome my phobia of flunking out of school," he says. 
</P>

<P>
Seafest continues -- Newport Beach's Seafest, a series of ocean-related events 
held throughout the city, will continue this weekend with the Wooden Boat 
Festival, the Tall Ships Festival and the annual Character Boat Parade. 
</P>
<P>
The third-annual wooden boat festival will be held Saturday and Sunday and will 
feature more than 60 classic and contemporary wooden boats plus displays, 
demonstrations and seminars. There'll even be a boat-building contest in which 
contestants must actually construct and launch a boat during a specified period 
of time. The event is sponsored by the Marine Division of the Newport Harbor 
Area Chamber of Commerce. Admission is $3. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The 
festival will take place at the Sea Scout Base, 1931 W. Coast Highway, Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the tall ship Californian, back from a 10,000-mile voyage, will be 
open for tours from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., also at the Sea Scout Base. On Sunday at 
1 p.m., the Californian will join other tall ships, including the Pilgrim, for 
an exit parade out of Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, the 29th annual Character Boat Parade, featuring more than 50 
decorated boats, will take place from 1 to 5 p.m. in Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. On the 
Waterfront appears each Saturday, covering boating life styles as well as 
ocean-related activities along the county's 42-mile coastline. Send information 
about boating-related events to: On the Waterfront, Orange County Life, The

ART OF MOLDING PLANTS INTO FIGURES HAS LONG BLOSSOMED AT DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KNIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It will be about five years before Roger Rabbit makes the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Poppins should be ready to take root in about three years. 
</P>
<P>
It all depends on how much greenery they muster, and whether they have any bald 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
Roger, Mary and about 50 other characters and animals are the 
not-quite-ready-for-prime-time topiary figures in Disneyland's landscaping 
area, out of the public view. 
</P>
<P>
Budding figures in the back lot include Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, a 
full-grown Bambi, a skunk, a mountain lion and a tiger. They will pop up around 
the park in the next few years, as soon as a rich growth of leaves has covered 
any trace of their metal frames. 
</P>
<P>
Topiary, the shaping of shrubs, trees and vines into ornamental figures, has 
been a part of Disneyland since the early '60s, when Walt Disney envisioned his 
characters as living, growing art objects. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt had been to Europe and had seen some topiary," recalls Bill Evans, 79, a 
consulting landscaper who has been with Disney 35 years and has worked with 
Sunset magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still an ample supply of century-old topiary in Europe, some probably 
200 years old. Walt said to me, 'Why don't we do something like this?' 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Walt, the stuff you see will probably take us 20 years.' " 
</P>
<P>
Disney gave the OK, and Evans was able to present some simple topiary within 
two years. "It wasn't perfect, but it was presentable," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
To get results so quickly, he eschewed the age-old method of growing plants 
within metal frames and took full-grown plants, carefully bending them to fit 
the shapes. 
</P>
<P>
"We started off with a crocodile and the hippos from 'Fantasia,' " Evans said. 
"We used a six-foot-long blueprint and used warped reinforcing steel to match 
the skeleton of the figure. Then we used wire to get the third dimension and 
fleshed it out with other plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we used two different plant materials. For the rhino, the horn is 
part of a plant that comes up the foreleg." 
</P>
<P>
Today, topiary dots the park, with a leafy Dumbo holding court in Fantasyland 
and the largest collection of beasts situated in front of the It's a Small 
World ride. Most of the plants took seven to 10 years to mature, said Ken 
Inouye, landscape superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the animals are crafted from eugenia, a shrub well-suited to Orange 
County's climate. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I would recommend for homeowners," Inouye said. "It's 
fast-growing, with small leaves and favorable color." The shrub is resistant to 
pests, except for the eugenia psyllid, an insect that lays eggs on the bottoms 
of the leaves. Once hatched, the insects eat the leaves -- usually tender new 
foliage -- causing blisters. Inouye said that, like aphids, they can be 
controlled by washing them off with a water spray or pelting them with 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland is proud of its topiary because of its variety, but also because 
some of the creatures are fashioned from trees not normally used in the craft, 
such as olive trees, potocarpus and juniper, none of which are fast growers. 
</P>
<P>
"Euguenia takes half the time," Inouye said. 
</P>
<P>
One way to speed the process is to begin with the plant in the ground, where 
they grow faster than potted varieties with confined roots. 
</P>
<P>
Inouye said the temperature of the soil changes more drastically in the ground, 
promoting more vigorous growth. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's collection is nurtured in large redwood boxes made by Disney 
carpenters. The boxes are rotated 90 degrees every two or three months to 
ensure even growth. 
</P>
<P>
All of the shrubs and trees take full sun. A very light, sandy loam is used to 
ensure good drainage. Fertilizing is done as often as with any other container 
plant, Inouye said, which is more often than with a grounded plant. 
</P>
<P>
When a topiary figure reaches maturity, it is placed in the ground, box and 
all. Inouye said the Disney landscapers try to avoid replanting because of the 
stress on the plants. He would not place a dollar figure on the finished works, 
other than to say that they take so much care and time that "there is no way to 
value them." Suffice to say, Disney takes the finished works very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"In 25 to 30 years of topiary," Inouye said with pride, "we have never lost one 
or had to take it out."

PLANTS THRIVING INLAND CAN BE SICKLY ON COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some plants that thrive a few miles inland can be trouble for gardeners along 
the coast, according to Bobby Carrick of Shore Gardens nursery in San Clemente. 
Such favorites as roses, crepe myrtle, euonymus and deciduous fruit trees 
(peaches, plums and apricots) are subject to mildew on the coast, where it is 
warmer in winter but cooler in summer than inland areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bulbs are OK along the coast and now is the time to plant them there and 
inland. But, Carrick said, bulbs on the coast will come up earlier than their 
inland counterparts. This is also a good time for coastal gardeners to be 
planting color annuals such as pansies and snapdragons. 
</P>
<P>
Food for thought -- Feeding plants as the cold weather approaches is generally 
all right along the coast but it is definitely not a good idea in areas subject 
to frost. New growth, especially on tender plants such as bougainvillea, can be 
easily destroyed by cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
A few changes in the maintenance routine can help head off any damage. Feeding 
tender plants is a bad idea with cooler weather approaching. Watering should be 
thorough and deep, but the time between waterings should be increased. If, for 
instance, you watered once a week during summer, make it two weeks now. If the 
plants aren't drooping at the end of two weeks, stretch the time even more; by 
winter, waterings may be a month or more apart. 
</P>
<P>
Planting time -- Many Orange County residents from out of state many not 
realize that fall is often the best time for planting -- it's not time to put 
away those gardening tools yet. In fact, even longtime locals may be in for a 
few fall gardening surprises, according to the California Assn. of Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Annual bedding plants can be planted now to provide color in winter and into 
the spring -- good choices include pansies, violas, stock and fairy primroses. 
Colorful perennials ripe for fall planting include delphiniums, columbine and 
Shasta daisies. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of cool-season vegetables ideal for planting now, including 
peas, carrots, Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, spinach, chard and lettuce, along 
with broccoli and other cabbage varieties. In winter there are fewer weeds to 
pull, the rains help water the crop and the soil is more workable. 
</P>
<P>
This is also a good time to plant many types of lawn from seed. One advantage 
is that the weeds that always appear in new lawns are winter lawn weeds that 
will disappear when summer comes around. 
</P>
<P>
Color cascade -- A popular garden touch is growing plants on top of a retaining 
wall or in a raised bed to let their color cascade over the side. Some plants 
just won't achieve this effect, though. Plants that will include: ivy geranium, 
convovulus, lotus berthelota, lantana and lobelia for sunny spots; trailing 
campanula for sun or shade; hanging fuchsias for shady corners.

4 METHODS OF SCULPTING CREATURES IN YOUR GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The home gardener can undertake any of the four types of topiary but should 
realize that the art takes imagination -- and patience. 
</P>
<P>
The simplest method is free form, which involves no support structure. 
</P>
<P>
"Free form relies solely on the creativity of the gardener trimming the plant," 
said Disneyland's Ken Inouye. Outside It's a Small World, some of the shrubs 
are carved into geometric shapes, such as boxes and spheres. 
</P>
<P>
In European gardens, several shapes are sometimes incorporated on the same 
plant, such as cones, squares and triangles. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who trims hedges is engaging in elementary topiary. It just depends on 
how fancy you want to get. With a little artistic effort, a pair of hedge 
clippers can turn a bush into the Sphinx. 
</P>
<P>
"Ficus is good for free form," Inouye said, but fast-growing eugenia can also 
be used. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dramatic example of free-form topiary is the Japanese art of 
bonsai, in which such specimens as juniper are trimmed and pinched to resemble 
miniature mature trees. 
</P>
<P>
The second method, and the one used for the largest topiary figures, is to grow 
a plant within a superstructure of reinforced iron rebar. 
</P>
<P>
The half-inch-thick bars are twisted, cut and fused into the skeletal image of 
an animal. "You need a very talented welder," Inouye said. 
</P>
<P>
The structure is then placed in a large box or in the ground with a shrub or 
tree under it. It takes at least five to seven years for this type of topiary, 
and it can take up to 10 years to grow enough foliage to fill out a 5-foot-tall 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
For faster results, an already-mature tree can be bent to conform to the 
skeleton, but this is tricky and must be done carefully to avoid breaking the 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
In Disneyland's back lot, an olive tree is taking the form of a majestic swan 
inside its rebar skeleton. At four years old, it has five more years to go 
before it is presentable to park visitors, Inouye said. Standing naked, 
awaiting its foliage, is a crocodile upright on two legs. It is one of several 
creatures planned for Disneyland's new Critter Country (formerly Bear Country), 
which also includes a formidable mountain lion and a skunk with its tail in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
The third topiary method incorporates what Inouye calls "a different 
philosophy." Instead of providing a hard, skeletal base that will stay with the 
plant, a chicken wire or hog wire form is fashioned like a crustacean shell, 
with the plant growing completely inside. When the leaves emerge to cover the 
wire, it is time to cut the wire away. After that, it is just a matter of 
trimming, free-form style, to keep the shape of the animal. 
</P>
<P>
Several Disneyland creatures are being sculpted this way, including a Roger 
Rabbit and a Mary Poppins -- complete with suitcase and umbrella. Actually, 
Mary is a combination; the hog wire holds the eugenia in the main shape and 
suitcase, and the umbrella is made of rebar. Inouye said another plant will 
probably be used to fashion the umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
If the figure is small, the artist can use chicken wire, which is very thin 
wire in hexagonal shapes. Hog wire, which is the same as chicken wire only with 
larger hexagons, is used for bigger figures. Supplementary wire can be used to 
extend or strengthen shapes, but Inouye warned against using any copper wire, 
which poisons the plants. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth type of topiary is similar to the third in that an outer shape is 
made from chicken wire. But inside the wire is a stuffing composed of spagnum 
moss, into which a plant or vine is inserted. The moss serves as a solid base 
and nutrient source, and the plant covers it almost the way fur covers an 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a spongy, solid structure. 
</P>
<P>
Inouye noted that unlike Disneyland, Disney World in Florida has a large 
collection of these types of structures because the Florida climate is more 
suited for them. But he is experimenting with several of them inside a 
greenhouse. A Mickey Mouse composed of ficus repens, which is a vine or bedding 
plant, is slowly growing amid some spagnum moss on a worktable. Another Roger 
Rabbit resides on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Growing the vines is not difficult, Inouye said. You just wet the spagnum moss, 
stuff it into the shape, insert the vines and tie up the holes with other wire. 
Nurseries rarely carry chicken and hog wire, but hardware stores do. 
</P>
<P>
Sculpting the wire shape is the biggest hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing to furnish is the creativity and the imagination," Inouye 
said. "Fortunately, we have employees who are extremely talented."

ROCKWELL BOWS OUT AS OPERATOR OF ROCKY FLATS NUCLEAR FACILITY

The Energy Department announced Friday that Rockwell International Corp. will 
bow out as operator of the beleaguered Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant and a 
new company will take its place. 
</P>
<P>
The action marks the final breach between Rockwell and the department, 
apparently over the growing problem of hazardous waste at the plant and 
responsibility for the disposal of that waste. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said in a statement from Washington that he 
and Rockwell Chairman Donald Beall had agreed to change Rocky Flats' management 
"in the best interest of both parties." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said another government contractor, EG&amp;G Inc., a $1.4-billion 
scientific engineering firm based in Wellesley, Mass., had been asked to 
replace Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
EG&amp;G is the prime contractor for the department's Idaho National 
Engineering Laboratory and is a contractor at the Nevada test site and 
government facilities in New Mexico. Company officials were not available for 
comment late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
EG&amp;G issued no statement on the agreement. The company's representatives 
were scheduled to be at the weapons plant on Monday, the Energy Department news 
release said. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's statement Friday said Rocky Flats' current work force of 5,000 would 
not be affected by the change in management. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockwell has agreed to continue operating the plant and to assist in the 
orderly transition," the release said, adding that discussions among the Energy 
Department, Rockwell and EG&amp;G were scheduled to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell sued the U.S. government on Thursday in U.S. District Court in 
Washington, claiming that conflicting federal rules require it to violate 
hazardous waste disposal laws at the plant. The same day, the Environmental 
Protection Agency cited Rockwell for violating hazardous waste storage laws at 
Rocky Flats. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has operated the plant 16 miles northwest of Denver since 1975, when 
it took over from Dow Chemical, which had been the operator since the plant 
opened in 1953. It is the nation's only manufacturer of plutonium triggers for 
nuclear weapons.
