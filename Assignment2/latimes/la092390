While women, blacks, minorities and other second-class citizens in this great 
land vie for crumbs from Hollywood's table, isn't it fun to read Jack Mathews' 
puff piece about our $60-million white male movie star's exploits, girlfriends, 
toys and other gratifications? The adulatory tone of the article was positively 
sickening, given the fact that Nicholson's acting has far more to do with 
bravado and image than any real work on character, and he's basically played 
the same role -- himself -- in every picture he's ever appeared in. 
</P>
<P>
The article was practically a textbook on the arrogance of stardom: the string 
of cars, the ostensible worship by former co-workers, the parts he's gotten for 
his bedmates. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, as do the offspring of other "stars," his daughter also gets a 
facilitated entree into show business. 
</P>
<P>
Mathews makes the stars' philandering sound practically poetic ("enough 
dalliances to quench the fires below") and typically challenges Nicholson on 
nothing. Well, you don't get lucrative writing assignments from The Times being 
a troublemaker, I guess.

Ah, how comforting to know that Hollywood celebrities are human like the rest 
of us. Witness the pimple in the crease of Jack Nicholson's nose. 
</P>
<P>
Why, I suspect that even these pampered, highly overpaid prima donnas put their 
pants on, one leg at a time, like Joe and Joanie Ordinary.

OUTTAKES: GULF MANEUVER

<P>
As the Persian Gulf crisis continues, with U.S. troops deployed as part of 
Operation Desert Shield, producer Menahem Golan has been revamping "S.E.A.L.S," 
which he'll start shooting later this month in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Rob Lowe, it's now called "Desert Shield (S.E.A.L.S.)" -- with the 
plot being reworked to take aim at Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Written several years ago, when Golan was a partner at Cannon Films, the script 
originally had Iranian missiles directed at U.S. ships in the gulf. Under 
co-writer and director Shimon Dotan, a former Israeli underwater commando, the 
storyline now has members of the Navy's elite commando squad out to thwart 
Iraqi missiles tipped with chemical warheads. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some modifications," admits Priscilla MacDonald, a spokeswoman for 
Golan's 21st Century Film Corp., who insists the company "isn't exploiting" the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Movies are made all the time about real people and real events," she says. 
"There's nothing wrong with dramatizing a situation that happens, or is 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Golan has previously raided the headlines with "Operation: Thunderbolt" (1977), 
shot just after the Israeli commandos rescued hijacked passengers at Entebbe in 
1976. And the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner inspired Golan's "The Delta 
Force" (1986). Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: SEEING THE RAIN FORESTS THROUGH THE FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of Hollywood's race for the rights to the story of Chico 
Mendes, the martyred Brazilian rubber tapper who fought to save the rain forest 
from cattle ranchers, a crop of films with rain forest themes or backdrops has 
taken root. 
</P>
<P>
First to blossom: Columbia Picture's "The Fifth Monkey," starring Ben Kingsley 
as a hunter journeying from forest to city, encountering a woman and four 
monkeys that change his life. It's due Oct. 5 from producer Menahem Golan and 
21st Century Pictures. Eric Rochat directs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other titles: 
</P>
<P>
* "Amazon," an action-adventure story about a quest for gold, with Finnish 
actor Kari Vaananen, Robert Davi and Rae Dawn Chong. Finland's Mika Kaurismaki 
directs, co-produces. Distributor not set. 
</P>
<P>
* "At Play in the Fields of the Lord," based on the Peter Matthiessen novel, 
now filming in Brazil. Hector Babenco directs and co-writes the screenplay in 
which missionaries, soldiers-of-fortune and developers scheme to push the 
Indians out of the forest. Produced by Saul Zaentz, the $28-million film stars 
Tom Berenger, John Lithgow, Daryl Hannah, Aidan Quinn, Kathy Bates and Tom 
Waits. 
</P>
<P>
* The animated "FernGully: The Last Rainforest," now in production, with 
direction by Bill Kroyer. 20th Century Fox plans a November, 1991, opening. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Stand," a love story from screenwriter Tom Schulman, starring Sean 
Connery and reuniting him with "Hunt for Red October" director John McTiernan, 
expected to get under way in January. 
</P>
<P>
* "Rain Forest," a fictional story involving a Mendes-like environmentalist, 
being written by John Lewis Carlino for producer Robert Redford. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Mendes project, Warner Bros., producing with David Puttnam and 
Brazilian-based J.N. Filmes, has approved a screenplay outline by William 
Mastrosimone, based partly on Andrew Revkin's nonfiction book about Mendes' 
murder, "The Burning Season." 
</P>
<P>
Neither a director nor start date is set, according to Colin Vaines, director 
of development for Puttnam's London-based Enigma Prod. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for the rights to Mendes' story -- including such participants as 
Redford, Steven Spielberg and Ted Turner -- was the subject of headlines in the 
summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say that all of us were slightly aghast at how things got out of 
hand," says Vaines. "All that bidding -- for the story of a man who led a 
modest life. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to think that we behaved very well in the circus." Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: WHO DID WHAT

<P>
The producers of Orion Pictures' "State of Grace" are taking the unusual step 
of promoting the writing contributions of a second writer on the project -- not 
something that happens everyday in an industry sensitive about rewrites. 
</P>
<P>
A Writer's Guild arbitration committee awarded sole screen credit to playwright 
Dennis McIntyre, who died Feb. 1 of stomach cancer at age 47. 
</P>
<P>
But at the end of the film -- a dark look at New York's Irish-American gangs, 
starring Sean Penn -- the producers give "special thanks" to another 
playwright, David Rabe, for his "contributions to the film." 
</P>
<P>
They also note Rabe's rewriting efforts in the movie's press kit, which is 
highly uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Co-producer Ron Rotholz explains that director Phil Joanou felt both writers 
deserved credit, and the producers agreed, but that McIntyre appealed to the 
WGA. Rotholz, who began developing the movie with McIntyre three years ago, 
says McIntyre definitely "wrote the movie," but adds that McIntyre also "worked 
hand-in-hand" with Rabe, primarily on dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt (Rabe) made a great contribution," Rotholz says. "We wanted to 
acknowledge that, even though his own guild didn't." David J. Fox

OUTTAKES: IS 'ROCKETEER' HIS ROCKET TO STARDOM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Who? 
</P>
<P>
That was the question on a lot of minds when Bill Campbell was announced as the 
star of Disney's "The Rocketeer." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the popular comic book character who fights for justice, donning a 
streamlined helmet and strapping a rocket pack to his back, it's due next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
A former commercial art student who considered becoming a comic book artist, 
Campbell, 31, came to town six years ago after working in Chicago theater. 
</P>
<P>
He's since appeared on a spate of TV shows, including "Dynasty," playing the 
boyfriend of Steven Carrington during the 1984-85 season; and a crew-cut, 
gum-chewing young cop on NBC's "Crime Story." 
</P>
<P>
"The Rocketeer" is the first feature film role for the boyish, 6-foot-4, 
205-pound actor. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the appealing things about him is that he's a regular guy," Campbell 
says of the character. "He wears aviator-type clothes -- you know, boots and 
leather jacket. And he's propelled through the air by something that is 
technically possible. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not so much a fantasy figure as he is an adventurer." 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Joe Johnston ("Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"), the film is currently in 
its second week of shooting near Valencia. Alan Arkin, Jennifer Connelly and 
Timothy Dalton co-star. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell spoke to us between takes, "beating up bad guys -- you know, 
delivering knuckle sandwiches." But he doesn't plan on doing his own "flying." 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Rocketeer wears a helmet, I think there's going to be a stunt man. I 
have no desire to hang from wires." 
</P>
<P>
A sequel to "The Rocketeer" is a possibility, but Campbell isn't worried about 
being typecast at this point. "I'm just happy to be working in a movie," he 
says. Pat H. Broeske

IN THE 1980S,the design pendulum swung away from hard-edged chrome and 
stainless steel chairs toward a rounder, softer, more romantic look. If 
modernist furniture represented masculinity, contemporary chairs -- in 
particular, wicker -- exemplify the return of the feminine. 
</P>
<P>
The 1908 Sears catalogue showcased 13 busy-looking wicker rockers; the 
top-of-the-line, $6.65 version, was death by curlicue: Overwrought to the point 
of hysteria, it bristled with fancy scrollwork and a continuous roll extending 
over the back, arms and under the seat, where it evoked love handles. Did Czech 
designer Borek Sipek have this rocker in mind when he designed his Prorok chair 
($1,250)? Never mind that the sinister, black, curving frame conjures up the 
image of a carapace of a giant insect; the Victorian love handles and the 
wicker's sensual and nostalgic appeal bestow a level of comfort that transcends 
the physical.

"WHAT'S harvested yesterday is delivered to you today," promises Malibu Greens 
owner Tracey Athanassiadis, referring to her colorful 15-pound seasonal gift 
baskets. 
</P>
<P>
The lush summer basket (available year-round) overflows with an assortment of 
at least 15 baby vegetables -- squash, eggplant, Lollorosso red lettuce, mizuna 
(a Japanese leafy green), leeks, purple and green kohlrabi, carrots, fennel and 
arugula, among them. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the vegetables are raised in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The baskets themselves, made of natural straw with handles, come wrapped in 
clear cellophane crowned by a big bow. The baby-vegetable basket sells for $38; 
the deluxe gourmet basket (a combination of vegetables and exotic fruits) runs 
$89. 
</P>
<P>
And for those yearning for an island getaway, Malibu Greens puts together a 
fruit basket ($55) that houses an assortment of exotic fruits -- papayas, 
mangoes, kiwis, passion fruit, Asian pears, persimmons, pomegranates and baby 
pineapples and coconuts -- from around the world. Malibu Greens delivers 
anywhere in the continental United States.

STAGE WEEK: 'DONA ROSITA': PLIGHT OF HISPANIC WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Lorca was the first Spanish playwright to write about human rights, especially 
the condition of women," said Margarita Galban, whose staging of Federico 
Garcia Lorca's "Dona Rosita the Spinster: The Language of Flowers" (1935) opens 
Wednesday at Bilingual Foundation for the Arts. "In that era, women had only 
one role: to marry and have children. When that choice is denied to Rosita, she 
has nothing." 
</P>
<P>
When we meet Rosita (played by Elise Hernandez) she is 18, bidding farewell to 
her fiance, who's leaving to fulfill a family obligation. For years and years, 
she patiently waits for his return -- only to find out that he has married 
another. "At 48, she's an old woman, an old maid," said Galban. "But the play 
is not tragic because, really, nothing big happens to her. Nothing happens at 
all. Nothing changes. That's what's so sad." 
</P>
<P>
Galban, who played the title role of Dona Rosita in Mexico 23 years ago and 
directed a production in Los Angeles in 1973, was drawn back to the material by 
a new translation (by Carmen Zapata and Michael Dewell) and what she feels is 
an ever-timely subject. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important now, like (it was) 100 years ago," she said. Galban's feelings 
were reinforced during a recent trip to Mexico, where, she noted, "You look 
around and see the same thing. Women are (often) not allowed an education, so 
they can only raise children -- their own or other people's. Rosita is the 
daughter of a wealthy man, but when he died she lost the inheritance because 
she wasn't taught to manage the money." 
</P>
<P>
Although the production itself is large (13 actors will perform English- and 
Spanish-language versions on alternate nights), Galban feels "the beauty is in 
its detail -- the small, bittersweet touches -- and the poetry of the language. 
It's like a bunch of roses: soft and tender. With this new translation, I hope 
American audiences can see and understand the story better. And for (Latino) 
women, maybe they'll think a little more about their role in life, their 
choices." 
</P>
<P>
ANNIVERSARY: The Los Angeles Theatre Center will celebrate its five years on 
Spring Street with a black-tie gala at the Biltmore Hotel Crystal Room Thursday

production of William Inge's Death-Row drama "The Last Pad," opening Oct. 4 at 
Friends and Artists Theatre in Hollywood. Part of Amnesty's ongoing campaign to 
abolish the death penalty, "Last Pad" will be directed by actor Billy Hayes, 
author of "Midnight Express," the book-turned-movie on his incarceration in a 
Turkish jail in the '70s. Andy Summers, formerly of the rock group the Police, 
will provide a score. Three fund-raising events will be held as part of the 
run.

COMING CLEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You are to be congratulated on bringing the heartache of recovery to your 
readers in "Coming Clean" (July 29). More important is making them aware that 
recovery is possible. 
</P>
<P>
Author Marita Hernandez is to be complimented on such an in-depth study. 
However, I felt the article didn't clearly emphasize the positive aspects of 
coming clean and also needs some clarification. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of Impact's services are free to the person who cannot 
afford treatment. Four of the six people in the article are clean and sober as 
of the writing of this letter. The article dramatized and focused on some 
isolated situations -- signs, handcuffs, et cetera -- that in reality rarely 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
The author could have mentioned her visit to a completion ceremony for the 60 
people who joined almost 10,000 other Impact alumni on a new road to life. 
</P>
<P>
Impact is one of the toughest and most respected programs in the country, not 
just Los Angeles. This is because of its uncompromising commitment to dealing 
with a living problem, not just a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, recovery is difficult but not impossible. It is unfair to those who face 
the struggle every day to imply that a new start in life is not possible and 
only filled with heartache. Many are succeeding "one day at a time," bringing 
joy to themselves and their families. They know that recovery is possible with 
proper treatment and support.

Over the past five years, I've looked forward to the Puzzler. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I have fought over who gets to start first. We've fed our 
children late dinners; paid Pacific Bell a fortune in exchanging clues, and 
used our dictionaries, encyclopedias and atlases to the point of knowing now 
why we forked over all that dough. I won't go into all the other details of 
what we go through to complete your puzzles each week. We just wanted you to 
know how much enjoyment the Puzzler gives us.

TOW AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was appalled at Harry Shearer's total lack of responsibility, both for his 
own actions and as a journalist ("And Away They Tow," Man Bites Town, July 22). 
</P>
<P>
Though this country has more freedom than any other in the world, our founding 
fathers set rules, called laws, to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
We, as citizens, must obey and respect the laws, whether we like them or not, 
and if not, vote to change them. Clearly, Shearer has no respect for our laws, 
or he just simply cannot read. 
</P>
<P>
What would prompt someone to park directly under a sign that read: "Tow-Away," 
other than a complete act of defiance, not to mention total stupidity. And then 
to take it a step further by blaming the police for doing their job. 
Unfortunately, we will always have those citizens like Shearer, who feel they 
are, for whatever reason, above the law. 
</P>
<P>
Consider how you handle an emergency. Who do you go to for help? The police. 
They are there to protect and serve. Many people do not like cops until they 
need one. And last, but not least, if the Los Angeles Times Magazine is going 
to endorse Shearer's "work," then please be more responsible. A lot of people, 
including children, read the magazine every week: The immature visual depiction 
of an unshaven, dirty pig in a police uniform is enough for even a 2-year-old 
to comprehend.

FALL PREVIEW;

THE CALENDAR CRITICS' BEST BETS FOR THE REST OF '90;

How can you tell fall has arrived in eternally sunny Southern California? Well, 
one way is by the start of the autumn arts and entertainment season. This 
special fall preview section provides listings of events from today through the 
end of the year and our critics' picks for the best bets in film, pop music, 
jazz, stage, music and dance and the visual arts. (Some box-office telephone 
numbers may not be in operation yet.) 
</P>
<P>
As kids, some of us actually looked forward to the opening of school. For the 
art crowd the unfurling of the fall exhibition season has some of the same 
charm. This year the menu shows enticing helpings of early modern, 
international contemporary, photography and those slightly esoteric shows 
promising offbeat insight. 
</P>
<P>
The County Museum of Art launches the season today with "American Arts and 
Crafts: Virtue in Design." The A&amp;C movement set the stage for modern 
aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
The season's most eagerly-awaited painting exhibition is LACMA's 175-piece "The 
Fauve Landscape" (Oct. 4-Dec. 30). The work seemed so shocking in 1904 its 
artists were dubbed "wild beasts." In fact they were such domesticated animals 
as Henri Matisse and Raoul Dufy. 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Edvard Munch made art a confessional for spiritual anguish and 
obsession. He became one of art's greatest printmakers as will be seen at LACMA 
(Nov. 22-Jan. 6) in some 100 sheets from the Epstein family collection. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's 25th anniversary show will unveil gifts and promised gifts (Oct. 
14-Dec. 30). Connoiseurs will not want to miss "Masterpieces in Focus" a 
scholarly comparison of three versions of Jean-Baptiste Simeon Chardin's 
endearing, "Soap Bubbles"(Oct. 18-Jan. 20). 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, contemporary exhibitions will reflect the prevailing 
internationalism of the scene. Homeboy Ed Ruscha is an influential part of it 
as will be seen when the Museum of Contemporary Art hosts a retrospective (Dec. 
9-March 24). 
</P>
<P>
Like Ruscha, the Brits had a hand in Pop and Conceptual art, too. In 1950s 
London, a covey of artists made installations inspired by popular culture. 
Several will be recreated for MOCA's "The Independent Group: Postwar Britain 
and the Aesthetics of Plenty" (Nov. 4-Jan. 13). 
</P>
<P>
Equally compelling are MOCA's upcoming local introduction of German artist and 
filmmaker Rebecca Horn (Oct. 22-Mar 24), British sculptor Tony Cragg at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum (Oct. 14-Dec. 30) and USC's "Keepers of the Flame," 
which will look at 20 Soviet dissident artist from Leningrad (Nov. 15-Jan. 13). 
</P>
<P>
The roster of photography choices ranges from Ansel Adams' classic landscapes 
at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art (Dec. 1-Feb.10), to the fey, conceptual 
fantasies of Duane Michals at San Diego's Museum of Photographic Arts (Dec. 
12-Feb. 10). 
</P>
<P>
One has delicious hunches about some shows. Poets can anticipate "Yoshitoshi: 
One Hundred Aspects of the Moon" at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art (Oct. 
29-Jan 27). The series uses aspects of the moon as metaphor for human moods. 
</P>
<P>
Art collected by the man who looked most deeply at those moods will appear in 
"Sigmund Freud and Art" -- UC Irvine's show of his personal collection of 
antiquities (Nov. 10-Dec. 3). WILLIAM WILSON

RECORD RACK: *** ROGER WATERS "THE WALL: LIVE IN BERLIN" MERCURY: ALBUMS ARE 
RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).

Restaging "The Wall" with a cast of zillions last July in an undivided Berlin 
was a grand gesture, but need we bother with another recording of the 1979 
magnum opus Waters originally conceived for Pink Floyd? 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
The recording is a logistical achievement that seamlessly blends orchestra, 
choir, Waters' extremely effective rock band and a succession of guest singers 
and soloists. While Cyndi Lauper misfires on "Another Brick in the Wall" and 
Sinead O'Connor underplays her role on "Mother," many of the guest turns are 
exceptional: a shockingly husky-voiced but haunting Joni Mitchell, aggressive 
grit from Bryan Adams, Paul Carrack's graceful R&amp;B classicism and, above 
all, Van Morrison's impassioned "Comfortably Numb." 
</P>
<P>
Though repetitive, and short on pop aria compared to such standard-setting 
programmatic rock works as "Arthur," "Tommy" or "Quadrophenia," "The Wall" 
remains involving and gains thematic resonance from this performance's locus 
(the Nazi fantasy sequence played in the heart of Berlin!). All in all, this 
Berlin "Wall" stands up well to the test of any live album: Hearing it, you 
wish you'd been there. MIKE BOEHM

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 THE REPLACEMENTS "ALL SHOOK DOWN" SIRE: ALBUMS ARE RATED

In which Paul Westerberg completes the progression from unruly rocker with a 
tender heart to tender-hearted tunesmith given to rock spasms. "All Shook Down" 
erupts periodically with patented Replacements release, but it's defined by 
songs like "Sadly Beautiful," which carries a deep country sweetness on a wisp 
of country form, and "Last," a swingin' little number from Paul's piano bar. 
</P>
<P>
There are guest stars all over (including John Cale, Johnette Napolitano and 
Los Lobos' Steve Berlin), but the music is relaxed, stripped-down and informal: 
It sounds as if it's falling into place on the spot, and you can sense 
musicians surprising and prodding each other. The combination of acoustic 
bedding, electric riffing and hard, loose drumming is pure Kinks, and the band 
taps a similar vein of wistfulness and crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, "All Shook Down" is a showcase for Westerberg's song craft and his 
weirdly virtuosic vocal performance. It sounds like the end of a long day -- 
literally and metaphorically -- and Westerberg is reflective and unguarded, 
registering the lyrics' every emotional tug and texture. His voice is a rough, 
weary croon with a Lennonesque bite, and as he considers mysterious women, 
knotted relationships and dashed idealism, it breaks and trembles, sighs and 
yawns, grumbles and soars. 
</P>
<P>
Call it hard-core naturalism, combine it with his ability to evoke ache and 
longing, and you have a record that's sadly beautiful indeed. RICHARD CROMELIN

RECORD RACK: THE VAUGHAN BROTHERS' BLUES-GUITAR LEGACY;

Not the in-yer-face, six-string razor whip-out! one might expect from the first 
collaborative record by these two Texas guitar-slingin' siblings, but a warm, 
kinda kicked-back, decidedly non-competitive, 
just-dropped-in-to-pick-'n'-grin-after-dinner session. 
</P>
<P>
This triumph of feel over content extends to the songwriting, although the 
Stax-track soul ballad for universal brotherhood ("Tick Tock") and the James 
Brown funk vamp ("Baboom/Mama Said") are surprising pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
Fronting a skintight rhythm section (with occasional keyboards, horns and 
backing vocals added for color), Stevie Ray handles most of the vocals -- older 
brother Jimmie takes two (a first) -- but it's the three instrumentals that 
really put the peppers in the potluck. 
</P>
<P>
The Lonnie Mack-inspired "D/FW," the swirling, guitar-as-organ, move 'n' groove 
"Hillbillies From Outerspace" and especially the live-in-the-studio, 
passing-one-guitar-between-'em, first-take blues "Brothers" that ends this 
combination platter are nuthin' but fine, fine, superfine, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Vaguely melancholic, too, mostly because it's hard not to think about Stevie 
Ray's recent death in a helicopter crash, making the prospect of the flashy 
fretgrinder and his arguably more bluesicianly bro' doing it live! an 
impossibility. DON WALLER

POP EYE: ELECTRA CELEBRATES ITS TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock music has a notoriously short memory. 
</P>
<P>
That makes it especially refreshing to see Elektra Records celebrate its 40th 
anniversary this week with "Rubiyat," a double album that features both 
memorable songs by vintage Elektra artists -- and covers of those same tracks 
by a new generation of Elektra acts. 
</P>
<P>
When Bob Krasnow first took over Elektra Records in 1983, he wasn't worried 
about the label's history -- he simply wanted to keep the struggling company 
afloat. "Elektra had really lost its identity," Krasnow recalls. "My mandate 
was to revive the label and put it in a position of being attractive to new 
artists again." 
</P>
<P>
Krasnow quickly slashed Elektra's 150-artist roster to a skeleton crew. "We had 
Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, the Cars, Queen, Don Henley and Glenn Frey and 
not much more," he recalls. "There were some days when we were lucky to do 
$30,000 in business." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Elektra's 45 or so acts offer an impressive array of pop artistry, 
including critic faves (Tracy Chapman and 10,000 Maniacs), black popsters 
(Anita Baker and Keith Sweat), headbangers (Metallica and Motley Crue), British 
imports (Simply Red and Billy Bragg), rock hipsters (the Cure and the Pixies) 
and world-music faves (the Gipsy Kings and Ruben Blades). 
</P>
<P>
"What distinguishes us from other labels is that we see talent in terms of 
long-term achievement," says Krasnow. "We don't look for quick hits. When you 
make a decision today, you want to be able to live with it five years from 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Elektra's "Rubiyat" project embraces that theme. "I thought the greatest 
respect we could pay to the company would be getting our artists involved in 
the music of our past," says Krasnow, adding that 25% of the proceeds from the 
record will go to the United Negro College Fund, Greenpeace and Save the 
Children. "There's a certain sense of romance about a record company. How many 
artists have said, 'I want to be on Columbia because Bruce Springsteen is 
there' or 'I want to be on Atlantic because of Led Zeppelin'?" 
</P>
<P>
"Rubiyat" features a host of tantalizing matchups. Faster Pussycat covers Carly 
Simon's "You're So Vain." The Georgia Satellites handle John Fogerty's "Almost 
Saturday Night." The Pixies revisit Paul Butterfield's "Born in Chicago" while 
the Cure tackles the Doors' "Hello, I Love You." 
</P>
<P>
"We gave the artists a menu of options or they came up with their own ideas," 
Krasnow says. "We went through nine deadlines to get everyone involved. 
Sometimes I had to rely on my powers of persuasion, but no one refused to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine many labels inspiring such commitment from its artists. 
Yet former Elektra execs -- even execs who didn't leave the label willingly -- 
view Elektra as a pop oasis. 
</P>
<P>
"What's great about Elektra is its overriding belief in the music," says Peter 
Philbin, a former Elektra A&amp;R exec who now runs an L.A. production and 
publishing firm. "I don't think you can find any label that does a better job 
of making every signing count. Krasnow has a great saying: 'You can't turn 
(manure) into chocolate ice cream.' Elektra doesn't make artists do a ton of 
demos or 20 different mixes. They just let the music speak for itself." 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Krasnow is the reason Elektra is a great record label," says Island 
Records President Mike Bone, who spent 4 1/2 years at Elektra in the 1980s. 
"Krasnow is simply one of the best A&amp;R people alive. Look at Elektra's 
roster -- it's the envy of the entire industry." 
</P>
<P>
Even Zoo Entertainment chief Lou Maglia, who left Elektra after a falling out 
with Krasnow, praises the label. "When I got there, Elektra was still a '70s 
label with David Geffen-signed artists like Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne," 
says Maglia, a key exec at Elektra from 1974 to 1984. "We went through a 
difficult period during the Joe Smith years when we weren't developing enough 
new talent. But Krasnow came in and focused everybody on making good records. 
Bob and I had our differences of opinion -- I never felt I had the freedom to 
run the company without interference. But you have to give Bob credit. He has 
tremendous vision."

NOTEBOOK: HOLLYWOOD ATHLETIC CLUB WILL OFFER BISTRO, BILLIARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its heyday, the Hollywood Athletic Club (opened in 1924) was a movietown hot 
spot. It had a celebrity clientele, a popular dining room and a well-equipped 
pre-Sports Connection exercise facility. Now, after a recent stint as a Russian 
restaurant-nightclub, the old Athletic Club facility is taking its original 
name back -- but the only exercise its new customers will get is lifting their 
forks or chalking their cues. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to debut in mid-October, the revamped Hollywood Athletic Club -- 
which will be open to the public -- will offer some 42 billiards tables (plus 
three antique snooker tables, in case anybody still remembers how to play 
snooker) and a 92-seat restaurant called Drones Bar &amp; Grill. The principal 
investor in the project -- the renovation alone is said to have cost at least 
$1 million -- is David Harrison Gilmore, founder of Drones club in London 
(which is otherwise related to Drones Bar &amp; Grill in name only). 
Entrepreneur Tom Salter is managing director and co-owner, and Peter De Lucca 
-- former sous-chef at 72 Market Street in Venice and chef at the now-closed 
Darwin in Santa Monica -- is executive chef and restaurant owner, as well as a 
partner in the entire operation. (De Lucca's plans to open the Edgemar Bar 
&amp; Grill in Santa Monica, announced in this column last year, fell through.) 
</P>
<P>
"We've capitalized on a lot of the traditional design and architecture of the 
old club," De Lucca says. "We're sort of playing with the whole club thing, but 
not in an elitist kind of way. We're creating a comfortable atmosphere." He 
promises a reasonably priced American-bistro-style menu, with main courses in 
the $10 to $16 range. Sample offerings include Caesar salad, crawfish bisque, 
sweet corn chowder, hamburgers, shrimp and crab on toast with guacamole, penne 
with lamb ragout and fresh peas, steamed Norwegian salmon, grilled sausage with 
polenta, and a grilled 18-oz. porterhouse steak with fried onion rings. There 
will also be a full wine list and bar, with particular attention paid to ports, 
brandies, and other after-dinner drinks. "I think we'll do a cigar-and-brandy 
night once a month in part of the restaurant," De Lucca adds. Restaurant 
manager will be Adrian Walker, who has performed similar duties at the Darwin 
and, more recently, at Bob Burns, also in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"The law says we can't serve alcohol or food in the billiards room, at least 
for now," notes De Lucca, "but we're going to have a cappuccino-gourmet water 
bar, with virgin drinks available." 
</P>
<P>
SPICE LIMITATIONS: The Palace Cafe in Santa Barbara has gotten a hard-liquor 
license -- which reportedly costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $50,000 -- 
in order to serve just one drink: the Cajun martini. Not only will this 
cocktail, made according to a recipe developed by Paul Prudhomme, be the only 
alcohol offered at the Palace, but service will be limited to one martini per 
customer. Why the limit? "Because our main focus is food," owner Steven Sponder 
says, "and too much alcohol can dull the taste buds." This, I might add, is a 
distinctly un-Cajun notion. 
</P>
<P>
NEWS AND NOTES: The proprietors of Trattoria Toscana in Brentwood will open a 
take-home facility, featuring rotisserie-cooked meat and fowl, pizzas and 
pastas, desserts, etc., on Barrington Avenue, also in Brentwood, in early 
November. The new place will be called Rosti -- which, curiously enough, means 
nothing in Italian but is the German/Swiss word for hashed-brown potatoes . . . 
. Premieres of Hollywood Restaurant and Bar, er, premieres shortly at the site 
of the old Hollywood Brown Derby on Vine Street, just off Hollywood Boulevard. 
Comfort lovers will be happy to hear that the original Brown Derby booths are 
still in place. . . . The Sakana Club, offering Franco-Japanese cuisine, is new 
in Brentwood . . . . The San Francisco branch of the Palm, located in the 
Juliana Hotel on the above-the-tunnel portion of Bush Street, has closed after 
four years. The property's owner, Kimco Hotel Management, which already runs 
such hotel-restaurants as Kuleto's at the Villa Florence and Masa's at the 
Vintage Court, will develop a new restaurant of its own in the space . . . . 
And Jerry Kretchmer, proprietor of New York's Gotham Bar &amp; Grill, is 
plotting a new restaurant, as yet unnamed, on the site now occupied by Cafe 
Rakel -- itself recently installed after the more serious, upscale Rakel was 
closed. Chef at Kretchmer's new place will reportedly be Bobby Flay, former 
sous-chef at the now-defunct Jams and more recently executive chef at the 
Southwestern-themed Miracle Grill. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S COOKING: The fifth annual Eat for Art event is scheduled for Monday, 
Oct. 1, at 6:30 p.m., at the carousel on Santa Monica Pier. More than a dozen 
Santa Monica and Venice restaurants will be dishing up their specialties -- 
among them 72 Market Street, Trattoria Angeli, Camelions, I Cugini, Michael's, 
Rebecca's and Rockenwagner's. Tickets for the benefit, with proceeds going to 
help fund Santa Monica art education for both children and adults, are $125 
apiece -- and advance reservations are imperative. Call (213) 458-8350.

WOMEN CONDUCTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because the Chamber Orchestra of the South Bay has had a woman conductor, 
Frances Steiner, as music director since 1974, we were particularly interested 
in Greta Beigel's Sept. 9 article "Music, Maestra." 
</P>
<P>
The award-winning, fully professional orchestra presents a five-concert 
subscription series as a resident company at the Norris Theatre for the 
Performing Arts in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Beigel should have included Frances Steiner's name among the several women 
she listed as pioneers in this field. Dr. Steiner was, in fact, the first woman 
to conduct a professional orchestra (the Glendale Symphony) at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion.

DOWNSIDE, UP SIDE OF SINATRA'S LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Frank Sinatra (Letters, Sept. 16) doesn't think that stardom is something 
that carries the potential for destruction. Well, Presley, Monroe and Joplin 
are just a few examples of lives botched by the trappings of superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
For Mr. Sinatra to trivialize George Michael's statements and make them seem 
superfluous or self-serving indicate his grasp of the downside of "the 
business" is minuscule. A performer is, foremost, a human being, not a 
commodity, a wind-up toy or machine. 
</P>
<P>
For Michael to see that stardom is robbing him of something meaningful is a 
heartfelt realization, and he deserves a measure of respect for it. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Sinatra, you're one of the best, but you missed the mark in your 
observations about George Michael.

SYLVESTER STALLONE, A MAN OF LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It just can't be a coincidence anymore. First there was "Rocky." Then there was 
"Rambo" and "Cobra." Now, it seems that Sylvester Stallone is doing yet another 
one-word title movie named after a five-lettered protagonist, "Oscar" 
(mentioned in the Sept. 16 Movie Chart column). 
</P>
<P>
He should stop beating around the bush and call all of his movies exactly what 
they are: MONEY! 
</P>
<P>
It is also interesting to note that if you replace the m in Rambo with a C and 
rearrange the letters you get Cobra; and if you replace the b in Cobra with an 
s and rearrange the letters you get Oscar. This means the pattern is to replace 
the middle letter and rearrange the letters. Since this means that the c must 
now go, I predict his next film will replace it with a t and become "Ratso."

What a sad and stinging indictment of our teenybopper-based pop culture -- and 
The Times' ability to pander to it -- that singer George Michael is worth 96 
column inches of copy while symphony conductor JoAnn Falletta gets a little 
more than half as much space. 
</P>
<P>
Michael is obviously a thoughtful enough young fellow to realize he's in velvet 
bondage, captive to the recording industry that's done such a splendid job of 
savaging music. Best wishes for his escape.

I enjoyed Nikke Finke's Sept. 16 article "Not Your Typical Wise Guy," about 
actor Ray Liotta -- except for the ethnic slurs. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the half-Italian, half-Scottish/Irish actor, Finke writes that 
Liotta is not from "a big ethnic family with spaghetti stains on their collars 
and cabbage smells in their clothes." Now really, if the article were about 
Eddie Murphy, would Finke have written that he was not from a family with 
watermelon stains on their collars and fried chicken smells in their clothes? I 
doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
No ethnic group or race deserves that type of treatment. Ethnic stereotyping is 
insidious and destructive and has no place in The Times.

PRISON PLUS FINE SOUGHT FOR SILBERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted financier Richard T. Silberman, facing a lengthy prison term after 
admitting his involvement in a scheme to launder alleged drug money, should 
also pay a $75,000 fine when he is sentenced Monday, federal prosecutors 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's attorneys, in legal papers filed Friday, said the one-time 
governor's aide is ruined financially and cannot afford a fine. 
</P>
<P>
In the papers, which covered a wide range of subjects in an attempt to rebut 
federal investigators' pre-sentence claims, defense attorneys provided new 
details about Silberman's suicide attempt last February in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
After writing a farewell note to his wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan 
Golding, Silberman drank heavily and took an overdose of pills that included 
tablets that had been prescribed for a family dog, defense lawyers said. He is 
no longer a suicide risk and will adapt well to prison, preferably a 
minimum-level security camp, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, pleaded guilty Aug. 24 to one felony count of conspiring to 
launder cash by violating federal currency laws. As part of a plea bargain 
struck with federal prosecutors, he agreed to drop an appeal of the sole count 
on which he was convicted June 28 after a two-month trial, a violation of the 
same technical currency laws. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who were spared the burden of a second trial by the bargain and 
agreed to drop four other charges against Silberman, have agreed to recommend 
Monday to U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving that Silberman serve 41 to 51 
months in prison -- for both counts, to run concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the documents filed Friday, prosecutors indicated that federal 
investigators have recommended to Irving that Silberman should spend 
significantly more time in prison -- a sentence of up to 63 months. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr., was charged with directing a scheme to launder $300,000 in cash that an 
undercover FBI agent had portrayed as the proceeds of Colombian drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
Four other men have been charged in the case, two of whom have pleaded guilty 
to a single felony count. Silberman's plea bargain did not include the two 
others -- including reputed mobster Chris Petti, 63, of San Diego -- who are 
due to stand trial Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's guilty plea set in motion the preparation by federal probation 
department investigators of a pre-sentence report, a recap of the case for 
Irving to consider in imposing a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer George C. Harris said in the defense papers that the plea 
bargain calls for a 41-to-51-month term. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gorder said Silberman should pay a $75,000 fine -- 
essentially the amount of money that recently obtained Swiss bank records 
indicated Silberman pocketed on the first of the two transactions in the case, 
a November, 1988, swap of $100,000 for stock in a financially ailing Silberman 
gold-mining subsidiary, Yuba American Gold.

PYRENEES NATIONAL PARK, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the story of a dozen bears with pretty names like Papillon, Zoe, 
Dominique and Camille, who have become the center of one of Europe's fiercest 
environmental debates. It also concerns Jojo, a millionaire loner, who is the 
best-known animal in the Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
Jojo is tame and the rest are wild. Fifteen thousand people a year visit the 
village of Borce, France, under snow-speckled mountains to see Jojo in his cage 
and be told how he was rescued as an abandoned cub by schoolchildren 19 years 
ago. He is soon to be given a 1.5 million reserve of his own and his first 
mate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for spoiling him is that he justifies the logo of the Aspe 
Valley, the entrance to the Pyrenees National Park. On tourist brochures, a 
cuddly teddy clutches a flower, giving the impression that bears are as common 
as those in America's Yellowstone and as much loved. 
</P>
<P>
Both themes are wrong. Bears are all but invisible while local people fear that 
campaigns on their behalf will hold up road, ski station and other building 
plans that might save a dying valley populated by dairy farmers who have hated 
bears for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Europe's environmentalists say the bears could be extinct within 
20 years unless strict protection guidelines are obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the national park's scientific committee, Michel Clin, a Bordeaux 
geological professor, agreed with this view. He resigned in anger in July, 
saying that the valley's 13 local councils were going ahead with development 
plans that will destroy one of Europe's last bear colonies. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the Pyrenees Park might think that this has already happened. A 
game warden has just retired after 45 years' service without ever sighting the 
animal. Villagers at Urdos or Accous tell thrilling stories of bears attacking 
the parish priest's beehive or terrorizing isolated shepherds but the tales 
date back 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
Only men of faith see the bears. A local photographer, Gerard Lopez, camped out 
every week for six years before he got his picture. But the most persistent 
bear-tracker is Jean-Jacques Camarra, an official of the National Hunting 
Office who has identified and named at least a dozen bears although sometimes 
the only clue was a footprint or a piece of fur. 
</P>
<P>
His whole life is devoted to protecting the animals and he spends seven or 
eight hours a day walking from forest to forest. He has seen bears only 12 
times in 10 years -- including cubs playing with butterflies -- and has just 
written a book called "L'Ours Brun" in which he reveals their names for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
In it, he sets out the arguments of environmental lobbies, backed by the 
minister, Brice Lalonde, who believes the bears must have 250,000 acres of what 
he calls "tranquility space" to survive beyond 2010. The enormous popularity of 
Jean-Jacques Annaud's film, "The Bear," which was pre-released here to a 
background of violent controversy, has done much to aid his cause. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not just an ecological argument" he said. "The presence of bears and 
their increase could contribute to bringing back prosperity to the region". 
</P>
<P>
This is a minority view in a valley of 3,000 people that has lost 75% of its 
population in 90 years. The bear is a natural enemy of high altitude sheep and 
cattle farmers. Last year there were 39 cases of bear attacks on sheep, but 
shepherds say there were many unproved cases where animals died of fright. Turn 
of the century photographs of villagers tormenting or maltreating 10-foot-high 
bears show how deep the resentment goes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, two bears were shot dead despite fierce protection measures in which 
large areas are inaccessible to local communities. One village received 
compensation of 40,000 francs last year because a forest was put out of bounds 
so that bears would not be disturbed by timber work. Some of the money was 
spent on flying in food, including half a cow, by helicopter in an attempt to 
lure the animals away. Helicopters are also used to fly shepherds' supplies to 
high mountain pastures so as not to disturb bear trails. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't collect wood, we can't graze sheep and we can't collect berries 
because of those animals" an irritated farmer said. "Bears, bears . . . they 
always come first." 
</P>
<P>
According to Jacques Capdeville, a nature lover who runs the equivalent of a 
public works cooperative for the 13 village councils, every argument over 
saving bears is full of contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
"There were more bears in the valley when there were more people" he said, 
implicitly casting doubt over the immense zone of tranquility that would throw 
centuries of farming tradition into disarray. "In the adjoining Ariege 
department bears have disappeared at the same time as the population has 
drifted away, leaving the area like a desert. Bears appear to thrive in the 
proximity of humans and it's not surprising if local people feel they should be 
left to sort this out by themselves without pressure from outside". 
</P>
<P>
In the Aspe Valley with its medieval stone villages, the rural drift has been 
temporarily stopped but new job opportunities are still desperately needed to 
persuade young people to stay. Local councilors have approved a 25-million 
franc European Community road-widening scheme, a new road tunnel alongside the 
park and long-distance skiing facilities and other developments to encourage 
tourism. The environmental lobby, backed by radicals who have destroyed 
construction equipment, say that the bears will run away in fright or just lie 
down and die if the work starts. 
</P>
<P>
But while Zoe, Dominique and Camille play hide and seek, Jojo looks smugger 
than ever in his cage at Borce. The same farmers who hate the wild bears go 
sloppy when they talk of the local orphan brought down from the mountains in a 
haversack. He will be more than ever the center of interest in his own 10-acre 
reserve from December, which expects to receive 50,000 visitors a year. At 20, 
he will at last be given a mate. Because of the shortage of candidates in the 
Aspe Valley, his mate will come from a Paris zoo.

RED CROSS WORKER REVISIT THE PAIN OF VIETNAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Vietnam War left Cherie Rankin a legacy of sadness denied and tears 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
As a 24-year-old Red Cross worker confronted every day by death and suffering, 
she was unable to cry. "When you're in a war," she says, "you have to turn off 
the feelings in order to do the work." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade after she came home in September, 1971, just thinking 
about Vietnam produced headaches, and she'd become sick to her stomach. At a 
reunion of Red Cross workers in 1984, she threw up. Until then, she says, she 
had no idea how Vietnam had affected her. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 20 years later, she is making a sentimental journey back to help restore 
some of what the United States destroyed, and to shed her tears. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin is part of a group of nine Americans paying their own way over to help 
rebuild a medical clinic near Hanoi destroyed by U.S. bombers. 
</P>
<P>
The team, which is leaving this month, is the third to return to build badly 
needed medical facilities under the auspices of the Veterans Vietnam 
Restoration Project in Garberville, Calif. During September and October, they 
will work with former Vietnamese enemies who now are comrades in peace. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin, now 44, will revisit the fields where the men she knew died and walk 
the grounds of the Da Nang-area orphanage where she fed, clothed and played 
with the pitifully maimed children of war. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was there, I never felt the sadness, and I carry around some pain for 
those children," she said. "Being able to do the crying on the spot would be 
helpful -- being near firebases where many men who died I knew, whose faces I 
see in my mind, to do some crying for them." 
</P>
<P>
She remembers flying in helicopters to the American firebases to boost the 
soldiers' morale. She is in field hospitals holding the hands of mortally 
wounded GIs. They clutch her tightly. She is their last link to life. 
</P>
<P>
The baby-face of a young GI she met in Da Nang while he was awaiting his 
assignment is forever fixed in her mind. He was so new his boots still were 
spit-shined. A few days later, she saw him lying in a field hospital with tubes 
sticking out of him and the right side of his face blown away. 
</P>
<P>
"I went over to him and held his hand," she said. "I reminded him I had seen 
him the other day, and I think I said to him: 'I'm sorry.' He flicked his eyes. 
He couldn't talk. But he gripped my hand." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, he was dead. "That was my first death experience. I marked that 
as the period of time where I numbed out. When I saw that kid there, I really 
wanted to run. I wanted to go home. I wanted my mother." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, she still can hear the familiar whirring sounds of the helicopters 
and her mind drifts back. She now feels the fear she repressed, and she shakes 
at the thought of it. 
</P>
<P>
Dreams of Vietnam invade her sleep. If she doesn't remember them, there always 
are the pillows across her body to remind her. During the war, Red Cross 
workers pulled mattresses over their bodies to protect themselves during rocket 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I will wake up startled . . . and all of my bed pillows are lined up the 
length of the bed," she said. "Even if I don't have a clear memory of the 
dream, I'm acting as though I were experiencing it." 
</P>
<P>
Other images are of the children for whom she cared. They are scorched by 
napalm, blinded by bombs. Their arms and legs are missing. 
</P>
<P>
Among her poignant photos is one of an orphan, an Amerasian boy born to a 
Vietnamese mother and American father. He sits forlornly. A fly rests on his 
face. One of his legs is missing, blown away by a mine. 
</P>
<P>
"He represents Vietnam to me," said Rankin. "This is the child of the war and 
it says it all to me."

<P>
But there were rare moments of joy amid the poverty and pain. A reminder is 
another photo, this one of three grinning orphan boys throwing their arms 
around her. One is blind, one is missing part of his leg and one is retarded. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," Rankin said. "Just look at how happy I am to see those kids and 
how happy they are to see me, how much physical touch is being shared." 
</P>
<P>
Rankin, who originally is from West Palm Beach, Fla., went to Vietnam in 
September, 1970, just out of Florida State University in Tallahassee. She did 
not believe in the war but had faith in the men who were fighting, like her 
younger brother, Doug, a Marine. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to visit my brother," she said. "Even though I had questions about the 
war, I really understood why the guys were there and I wanted to do what I 
could to help them. I also wanted the adventure and to find out why we were 
there, see for myself." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her reservations, and the sexism and sexual harassment she sometimes 
encountered, she didn't question the U.S. government's morality or motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so red, white and blue my blood was lavender," Rankin said. "I think we 
fell into two categories in their mind. We were either virgins or whores, their 
favorite girlfriend or sister, or we were there to be propositioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I was a pawn of our government, coercing soldiers to fight. Red Cross 
women were held up as home and apple pie. 'This is what you're fighting for.' 
The way the military used Red Cross women was sexist. We were there to be their 
decoration. We're flying out in helicopters in dresses." 
</P>
<P>
When she returned home a year later, the formerly gregarious woman withdrew 
into herself, seeking solace in solitude. "For many years, I would be afraid to 
be in crowds. I did not like going to social events," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But that has improved through counseling at a veterans center. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had therapy off and on for 10 years," she said. "I figure it's the rest 
of my life . . . I have impairment for any level of functioning, but it's a 
matter of growth, knowing yourself, learning about yourself. It's an ongoing 
process." 
</P>
<P>
She first went into therapy for help with some marital and childhood issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea Vietnam affected me until around six years ago," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband divorced in 1983, partly due to the war. 
</P>
<P>
"I closed the book on Vietnam when I got back like everybody else did," she 
said. "My husband had been a war protester and we never talked about Vietnam. 
He was not comfortable talking about it. Neither was anybody else in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
At the Vietnam reunion in New York City six years ago, "the whole thing started 
opening up, everything started coming to the surface," she said. Just after she 
arrived, she got a throbbing headache that lasted for a day and a half until 
she threw up. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt better after I did that," she said. "It's taken me a long time.

ARCHEOLOGISTS UNEARTHING VIKING SECRETS

BIRKA, Sweden 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The center of the Viking world 1,000 years ago is under siege by archeologists 
who are trying to pry secrets from beneath the pastures that now cover this 
farming island. 
</P>
<P>
Historians believe that Birka, a settlement on an island in Lake Maleren just 
west of Stockholm, was home to about 1,000 people. The site now is covered with 
grids, in which workers dig by hand through the seven feet of dirt covering the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Two sections have been excavated since the dig began this spring and although 
the findings have not been startling, they hint at a wealth of artifacts to 
come. The project is to last until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Animal bones, remnants of meals, colorful beads, combs and household utensils 
that could shed light on Viking home life have turned up. Archeologists also 
found Arab coins, evidence of how far the Vikings roamed. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings thrived from the late 8th Century to the 11th Century. Their raids 
struck terror throughout Europe, and their spirit of adventure drove them far 
afield, to Iceland and North America. 
</P>
<P>
Birka has been recognized since the Middle Ages as the cradle of Christianity 
in Sweden. It was here that Ansgar, a missionary from Bremen and later bishop 
of Bremen-Hamburg, first preached around 830. 
</P>
<P>
But while some Viking towns flourished, Birka was deserted at the end of the 
first millennium. Where traders once exchanged goods from all of the known 
world, sheep graze in meadows and on grassy mounds containing the graves of 
Viking traders. 
</P>
<P>
Historians say Vikings from the Birka region, a people known then as Rus, 
sailed eastward across the Baltic Sea and lent their name to the land of 
Russia. They reached the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Although Birka was the Vikings' center, it has remained mostly unexamined while 
extensive digs were conducted at Viking settlements in York, England; Dublin, 
Ireland; Hedeby, West Germany; Kaupang, Norway; and Staraya Ladoga, Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Viking era generally is regarded as having begun in 792, the year a raiding 
party attacked the Lindisfarne monastery on Britain's North Sea Coast. But 
evidence could be uncovered indicating that the era began earlier, said Bjorn 
Ambrosiani of Stockholm's Museum of National History. 
</P>
<P>
The only previous excavation of Birka was conducted 100 years ago by Hjalmar 
Stolpe, a zoologist who came in search of insect fossils in 1871 and stayed 24 
years to dig up many of the 2,500 Viking-age graves. 
</P>
<P>
Stolpe touched very little of the town of Birka, which stood at the focus of a 
heroic chapter in Scandinavian history. Ambrosiani and other experts are eager 
to find out how it was built and developed. 
</P>
<P>
The project is being financed by one of Sweden's richest men, industrialist Gad 
Rausing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go digging you should have proper resources, otherwise you do more 
damage than good," Ambrosiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Rausing, who has a doctorate in archeology, said he persuaded the board of 
directors of his family's Tetra-Pak packaging company to donate $2.4 million to 
the project for high-tech assistance -- computers to register the findings 
daily, and video equipment to document the objects.

HIGH SCHOOLS 'GUARANTEEING' GRADS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: WARRANTIES LET EMPLOYERS 'RETURN' THOSE WITH POOR JOB SKILLS. 
FURTHER TRAINING IS FREE.

This year's seniors at Ft. Zumwalt high schools will go into the world with 
more than just a diploma. Each graduate will be backed by a three-year 
warranty. 
</P>
<P>
A small but growing number of schools now add an extra stamp of approval to 
their products. It says, "satisfaction guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
"The diploma used to be the guarantee," said Ft. Zumwalt Supt. Bernard DuBray 
said, "but now we need to go above and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Such warranties typically guarantee that a graduate has learned the basic 
skills necessary to an entry-level job. If not, the school promises to provide 
additional training free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's accountability," said Bernard Sidman, superintendent of the 
Plymouth-Carver Regional School District in Massachusetts, which was the first 
to include a three-year warranty with its diplomas last spring. So far, none of 
its graduates have been sent back. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear an awful lot about the quality of public education and about public 
institutions of education not meeting their responsibilities in preparing 
students for entry into public life," Sidman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that if we were going to be asking the community to support us, maybe 
we should put ourselves on the line." 
</P>
<P>
But let the buyer beware: The training behind guaranteed graduates may vary. 
Some schools warranty all their graduates. In others, the warranty program is 
designed mainly for students who want to get jobs straight out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
At Prince Georges County School District in Maryland, students who want to be 
under warranty take a semester course in marketable skills. The class has been 
developed with the help of business and industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In Blue Springs School District, Missouri's largest, the graduate guarantee is 
printed on the back of a laminated, wallet-size diploma. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some tremendous young people coming out of our system," Supt. 
Charles McGraw said. "The nation's educational system is getting a bad rap, and 
we wanted to make a point that our graduates had the skills to be good 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is not enough to warranty students if there is no recognition of what is 
needed to do entry-level jobs in today's business world, said Fritz Edelstein, 
a senior fellow at the National Alliance for Business in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The demands of such jobs are much more complex in the 1990s than ever before, 
and the curriculum should reflect that, Edelstein said. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we went through a time when the curriculum was out of date," he said. 
"The curriculum has been slow changing -- it hasn't kept up with the progress 
of technology that the business world required. So this is an attempt to be up 
to date." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, McGraw said, mechanical drawing is out and computer-assisted 
drafting is in. At the junior high level, an exploratory course in industrial 
technology introduces students to robotics, broadcasting, electronics and 
computer science, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Educators say guarantee programs have helped to open communications between 
schools and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a feedback system," said Gary Marx, associate executive director of the 
American Assn. of School Administrators in Arlington, Va. "It's a way for the 
schools to say to an employer, 'It's all right to come back and let us know if 
there's something missing here.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the Harlem Consolidated School District, outside Rockford, Ill., seniors 
this year will be able to earn a "certificate of employability." 
</P>
<P>
The idea came about through meetings between school administrators and 
corporate leaders from the community, Assistant Supt. Wayne Musholt said. 
</P>
<P>
During the discussions, executives expressed concerns about the employability 
of some of those graduating, particularly those not going to college. 
</P>
<P>
"Their concern was that some of the students didn't always have the best work 
habits and attitudes, and we decided there ought to be a way of certifying 
them," Musholt said. 
</P>
<P>
To be certified, a student will have to earn the required high school credits 
and be absent no more than six days in a school year. In addition, work 
"attitudes" will be rated by teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The program at Prince Georges County schools has received high marks from 
business and industry leaders, said Bonnie Jenkins, director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The response has been overwhelmingly positive so far," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Employers prefer to hire young people who have completed the special semester 
course, which emphasizes good habits and attitudes about work, reasoning, 
problem solving and oral communication. 
</P>
<P>
"So it's giving them an edge," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year was the first for the project, and no student has been sent back for 
further training, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The guarantees rekindle employers' interest in high school graduates and 
encourage potential dropouts to stay in school, said Thomas Shannon, executive 
director of the National School Boards Assn. in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"This is adding a new dimension to the diploma," he said. "It's a gimmick -- 
it's right out of Madison Avenue -- but it also sends a powerful message to the 
school staff that your work is really on the line."

IT'S BARRIO VS. MADRID IN SPAIN'S NEW CIVIL WAR;

<P>
We don't want bread! 
</P>
<P>
 We don't want wine! 
</P>
<P>
 We want the mayor... 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging from a pine! 
</P>
<P>
That's the first verse of a new national anthem adopted by an angry suburb of 
Madrid that says it's seceding -- and the song pretty much sums up the feelings 
of the 500 residents. They charge that the Madrid City Council is trying to 
snatch their homes at a fraction of fair market value, and they are waging a 
savvy public relations campaign to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
The skirmishes have included a "Provisional Transitional Government," announced 
earlier this month, and demonstrations in front of the Cuban Embassy demanding 
political asylum. Madrid officials are not amused -- but other residents are 
beginning to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
The Barrio de Cerro Belmonte is a 20th-Century urban anachronism that began as 
a village on the outskirts of Madrid about 70 years ago, without water, 
drainage or even paved roads. As Madrid has spread, so Cerro Belmonte has been 
surrounded by modern developments and tower blocks of flats. Many of the 
families have lived there all their lives, paying for the installation of 
amenities and building their own houses, some of which have been expanded as 
their savings allowed and now boast modern bathrooms, kitchens, central heating 
and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
The owners, many of whom are retired, tend their gardens, lovingly planting 
grape vines, fig trees, and flower and vegetable plots. 
</P>
<P>
But 20th-Century speculation has caught up with them, and the Madrid City 
Council has plans to develop the area into an estate of luxury chalets that 
would be sold at prices beyond the dreams of the Belmonteses. Taking advantage 
of a 1985 land law, the area was designated a development zone, and the 
residents were offered money to move into alternative accommodations on the 
other side of the city -- financial compensation many times lower than the 
market value. Virtually all the residents rejected the council's offer, so a 
year ago the council placed a compulsory purchase order on the 30,000 square 
meters of Cerro Belmonte. 
</P>
<P>
But if the City Council thought that the affair would end at this point, with 
the sale of the planned chalets adding to its coffers, they had not counted on 
the Belmonteses or their lawyer, dynamic 28-year-old Esther Castellanos. Until 
this year Castellanos' legal practice had concentrated on divorce and 
matrimonial cases, but she has taken up the challenge with all the fighting 
spirit of a latter-day Spanish Civil War heroine. Although she admits to no 
political affiliation or ambition, she is masterminding a publicity campaign 
that would make any political leader proud. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that Spain's notoriously laborious court system was unlikely to be of 
any help, she decided to embarrass the City Council, whose members face 
reelection early next year, with a series of publicity stunts. 
</P>
<P>
In August, when relations between Spain and Cuba were at their lowest ebb in 
many years, a group of Belmonteses demonstrated outside the Cuban Embassy in 
Madrid and requested political asylum. Fidel Castro's reply was to invite 24 of 
them, whose ages varied between 10 and 84, for a fully paid 10-day visit to 
Cuba, where he treated them as VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
Then, earlier this month, the barrio issued a unilateral declaration of 
independence, naming Maria Teresa Quirol as head of state and threatening -- 
tongue in cheek -- to bar access to the barrio by instituting passport control 
and customs posts. It said it might also issue its own postage stamps and 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
These stunts have caught the ear of the public, which is asking embarrassing 
questions. Why, people want to know, have the residents been offered only 5,018 
pesetas (about $54) per square meter for their land when the going rate in the 
area is more than 20 times that? And who will profit when the land is sold for 
expensive developments? 
</P>
<P>
Castellanos and her supporters are determined to continue the struggle. 
Recently they announced their intention to join forces with other barrios 
facing similar threats -- the Kingdom of Cerro Belmonte allied with the 
neighboring Principality of Villaamil or the Country of Penagrande, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Cerro Belmonte's red-and-white flag is already flying, and residents set up a 
symbolic roadblock twice a day, barring access to the barrio. 
</P>
<P>
Madrid City Hall says it is not prepared to join their pantomime. Jose Luis 
Garro, second deputy mayor of Madrid with responsibility for urbanization, 
said: "I am not prepared to buy tickets for the Belmonte Circus." 
</P>
<P>
Castellanos countered: "If we are the circus, who are the clowns?"

A judge Friday sentenced religious cult leader Jeffrey Don Lundgren to death 
for killing a five-member family belonging to his cult. 
</P>
<P>
Common Pleas Judge Martin Parks, in issuing the sentence, followed the 
recommendation of a Lake County jury. 
</P>
<P>
The other option was life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Charles Grieshammer pleaded Thursday for the judge to spare 
Lundgren's life, saying the Independence, Mo., native believed he was following 
God's will when he shot the Dennis Avery family, which included children ages 
15, 13 and 6, to death. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, 40, a one-time lay minister in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, was convicted on Aug. 29 of aggravated murder for the 
1989 killings. 
</P>
<P>
The murders were committed in April, 1989, but the bodies were not uncovered 
until early January this year, after a member of Lundgren's former cult went to 
authorities in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The cult had broken up in December. 
</P>
<P>
Also facing a possible death sentence is Jeffrey Lundgren's 19-year-old son, 
Damon Lundgren. He was convicted of four counts of aggravated murder last week.

FIREFIGHTING: THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS PROMISES FIREFIGHTER TRAINEES 
LOW PAY, AWFUL HOURS, BACKBREAKING WORK AND LOTS OF SATISFACTION.

"Hard work, low pay, miserable conditions . . . and more!" 
</P>
<P>
To Placentia residents Paul Hathaway and Christian Kirk, it sounded too good to 
pass up. Last month, the pair joined a new program offered by the California 
Conservation Corps to train young firefighters, the first of its kind in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a job for the timid. 
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, the CCC is a work-ethic program. It's not a summer camp or 
vacation," reads the work agreement that all recruits must sign. "You'll do 
dirty, backbreaking work, and have few people to thank you for it." 
</P>
<P>
Now for minimum wage, Hathaway and Kirk work grueling, 10-hour days beginning 
at 6 a.m. Still, they said, it beats any other job. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would rather work at Mervyn's all day, but I'd rather be out doing 
something physical," Hathaway, 20, said. "I've always been interested in 
conservation, and when I found out the job was fighting fires, I thought that 
was pretty exciting." 
</P>
<P>
The Conservation Corps opened its first Orange County office in Yorba Linda on 
Aug. 1 and began recruiting. The County Fire Department loaned the office space 
and equipment, and it also helps to train the fire crews. In return, the corps 
provides manpower to fight blazes and help in other emergencies, said Scot 
Schmier, the corps' coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation. The county benefits. The corps benefits" and the 
trainees gain real firefighting experience, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen men are now training for front-line firefighting. A second group of 10 
will soon begin training as a support crew. 
</P>
<P>
Their days typically begin before sunrise. At a remote Silverado Canyon site 
called Hangman's Tree, Fire Department instructor Bob Feldtz recently took nine 
trainees on a mountain hike in 90-degree heat to acclimate them to the terrain 
and weather they will face. 
</P>
<P>
On their first afternoon wearing full gear -- heavy yellow coats and pants, 
hiking boots, helmets and goggles -- the crew warmed up with a brisk climb up a 
rocky hill. Then they cut access trails, called "scratch lines," through the 
brush with shovels and axes. After only 10 minutes, they had cleared a path 125 
feet long and 2 feet wide, and sweat had darkened the outermost layers of their 
protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about 150 degrees inside this, and it's not even a hot day. This ain't 
nothing to what a fire's going to be," Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
David Seminario of Fullerton, who at 18 is the youngest member of the crew, 
said, "It's like being in a microwave oven in here." 
</P>
<P>
Schmier suggested that they get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys are doing good -- only 11 hours and 45 minutes more until you're 
done," Schmier called out. His message was serious: They must be prepared for 
work on a real fire. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Feldtz called out, "Air drop, hit the deck!" to practice reacting to 
a water drop on a nearby blaze. The crew dove spread-eagled onto the trail as 
they would during such a drop to avoid being knocked down by the torrent. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1976, the Conservation Corps has employed more than 45,000 young 
adults. Firefighting is only part of the corps' work. Its members also build 
roads, clean parks and help restore wildlife areas. In the future, Schmier 
said, the corps will also be working with cities as well as the county. 
</P>
<P>
Corps' spokeswoman Susanne Levitsky said the new program's chief advantage is 
that it uses local residents and lets them work close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pride when you're working in your area or city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county Fire Department also uses state and county inmates from juvenile and 
adult institutions to fight fires, said Chip Prather, assistant chief of 
operations for the department, but is a separate operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservation Corps program can train 25 men and women ages 18 to 23. 
Although women make up 20% of the 1,800 corps members statewide and are 
encouraged to join the firefighting program, none has done so, Schmier said. 
</P>
<P>
Feldtz said the crew's determination shows. 
</P>

"I've only had them for four days, but they're really motivated. They really 
want to be firefighters. Anyone can work at McDonald's for $5 an hour. But you 
ain't going to get up at 5 in the morning to work at McDonald's. This shows 
they're really motivated to help California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk, 21, agreed.

"The pay doesn't mean anything to me. All my relatives think it's just great. 
It makes me happy to know I'm doing something to make them proud," he said.

LUNGREN BETTING THAT VOTERS PREFER CONSERVATISM;

<P>
POLITICS: REPUBLICAN OPPOSES ABORTION AND SUPPORTS OIL DRILLING OFF THE 
CALIFORNIA COAST -- STANCES THAT PLACE HIM DIRECTLY OPPOSITE HIS RIVAL FOR THE 
POST, DEMOCRAT ARLO SMITH.

<P>
Two years ago, the Democratic-dominated state Senate rejected the appointment 
of Dan Lungren as state treasurer, its leaders declaring that the Long Beach 
native's conservative views were too far right of the political mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
This November, voters statewide will get the chance to make up their own minds, 
in a race for state attorney general pitting the former five-term congressman 
against 11-year San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike this year's candidates for governor, Republican Lungren and Democrat 
Smith have clear-cut differences on two major issues: abortion rights and 
environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, a staunch abortion foe, says that if he ignored his conscience and 
kept quiet, it would be similar to the silence of the German public to the 
atrocities of World War II. While Lungren says he would seek to enforce any 
legislation terminating public funding of abortions, Smith has vowed to appear 
personally in court to preserve abortion rights and funding. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the environment. Lungren, whose candidacy is opposed by major 
conservation groups, supports offshore oil drilling on a case-by-case basis. He 
contends that Smith's opposition to any new offshore projects is an "extremist" 
view. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Smith, who waged a furious uphill battle to win the June primary against 
better-known Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, Lungren was unopposed 
for the Republican nod. Just like Smith, Lungren is invigorated by a tough 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Before the June primary, he persuaded Smith to participate in a series of four 
highly unusual Lincoln-Douglas style debates. After going head to head before 
sparse crowds from Sacramento to San Diego, Lungren challenged the Democrat to 
a similar series of moderator-free encounters in the summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Smith declined, and thus far has agreed to only three joint appearances on TV 
news conference shows -- which feature a more conventional question-and-answer 
format. Says Lungren: "(Smith) obviously wants to avoid debates as much as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Lungren decided to give up his secure seat in Congress in 
anticipation of assuming the treasurer's post, to which he was nominated by 
Gov. George Deukmejian. When the Senate rejected his appointment -- and the 
California Supreme Court turned down an appeal -- Lungren took a job as a civil 
attorney for a Sacramento law firm. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear from the start that he was plotting a swift return to public life. 
Politics is Dan Lungren's passion. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 6, he volunteered for his first campaign, handing out literature 
for a neighbor seeking the congressional seat that he would win himself 26 
years later. The same year, Lungren's father signed on as Richard M. Nixon's 
personal physician, accompanying the future President on the stump for several 
campaigns. Nixon remained a family friend and encouraged Lungren's entrance 
into politics. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Notre Dame and Georgetown University Law School, Lungren worked 
in the early 1970s for the Republican National Committee and for two Republican 
senators. He did not serve in the military, a fact the Smith campaign has been 
quick to seize upon. Lungren says he was classified 4-F at the height of the 
Vietnam War after informing his draft board that he had had a major kidney 
operation as a youngster and had severely injured his knees playing high school 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to California in 1973, Lungren joined a Long Beach law firm whose 
partners included former Democratic Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. Using his 
support for tax-cutting Proposition 13 as his main campaign focus, Lungren was 
elected to Congress in his second bid in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren concentrated on criminal justice and immigration reforms during his 
10-year Washington tenure, earning a reputation as an aggressive, intelligent 
legislator. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the qualities I admire in a politician," wrote Democratic Speaker of 
the House Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, in a letter that Lungren framed. "You are 
loyal to your party and your President, you love your country and you love 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
Other key Lungren traits, those close to him say, are self-confidence, strong 
convictions and a keen sense of competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
An avid weightlifter, Lungren practiced tae kwan do and played racquetball 
regularly until he needed a third knee operation. The father of three 
teen-agers, he views sports as an important character-builder. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, for boys," he said, "I'm not sure what outside of football these days 
provides them an opportunity to understand what teamwork and hard work and 
playing when hurt (are)." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything pleases him more than to watch his children participate 
in sports," said Lungren's wife, Bobbi. "He's also totally unpretentious. Fancy 
cars and restaurants mean nothing to him. He's perfectly happy at McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbi Lungren said it was tough -- but not that tough -- to see her husband run 
for office again after losing out on the treasurer's job in 1988. "I was 
looking forward to maybe a normal lifestyle, if there is any such thing," she 
said. "But I realize that this was his calling and he really was happy in 
public service." 
</P>
<P>
At the time that Deukmejian selected Lungren to replace the late Democratic 
Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh, Republican insiders viewed him as a possible 
successor to the governor. Lungren proponents maintain that he was rejected by 
the state Senate more for his strengths as a political up-and-comer than for 
his ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lungren was taken to task during the Senate hearings by 
organizations representing blacks, Latinos, Asians, senior citizens and 
environmentalists. Last week, a coalition of the organizations announced it is 
re-forming, charging that Lungren's record in Congress was "insensitive" and 
"extreme." 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club state director Michael Paparian said, "He has consistently voted 
against allocating money for programs for clean water, parks and wilderness, 
toxics control and other programs." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, who did support reduced funding for some environmental programs, 
insists that his votes reflected the need for fiscal conservatism rather than a 
lack of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Along those lines, Lungren noted, he once voted against funding for a new 
federal building in his Long Beach district, incurring the wrath of local 
officials who had eagerly fought for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his self-acknowledged ambition for higher office, Lungren says he would 
not use the attorney general's post to impose his political ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"Public-policy decisions will be made by the governor, the Legislature or the 
people if there is something on the statewide ballot," he said. "The attorney 
general is duty-bound to defend laws unless they clearly violate the 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Lungren opposes the sweeping "Big Green" environmental initiative 
on the November ballot, but he says that he would defend it in court if it is 
approved because it appears to pass constitutional muster. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is another example. 
</P>
<P>
While in Congress, Lungren co-sponsored a proposed constitutional amendment to 
ban virtually all abortions. But he says that as state attorney general, he 
must follow California's Constitution, which he interprets as allowing most 
abortions under its right-to-privacy provisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not go off half-cocked in trying to make a name for myself in a manner 
that contravenes what the law in California is," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren sees only two principal areas in which the attorney general would 
become involved in the abortion issue: representing the state in court on any 
legislation to restrict Medi-Cal funding and seeking enforcement of a 
parental-consent law limiting teens' access to abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists on both sides say the attorney general's role looms increasingly 
large as support for reproductive rights erodes on the federal level. 
</P>
<P>
To Janet Carroll, legislative director for the California Pro-Life Council, 
Lungren's election is essential. "Because of the good decisions we're getting 
from the U.S. Supreme Court -- it gives the states more latitude and we want a 
more vociferous defender of the laws we do get passed." 
</P>
<P>
In his campaign addresses, Lungren has insisted that the most important concern 
of the state's chief law enforcement officer should be the battle against 
crime, drugs and street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Over the months, Lungren has called for life sentences for kidnapers convicted 
of rape and the confiscation of driver's licenses of casual drug users. 
</P>
<P>
He demonstrated his leadership role as a crime-fighter while in Congress, he 
says, helping draft and win passage of legislation including the Comprehensive 
Crime Control Act of 1984, which resulted in more than 50 changes to the law, 
including authorization for authorities to seize the assets of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, for his part, has enforced the laws for 36 years -- heading the criminal 
division of the state attorney general's office before winning the San 
Francisco prosecutor's post in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Police organizations are split down the middle in their endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Art Reddy, president of the Los Angeles County Professional Peace Officers 
Assn., said his group backs Lungren because "we feel that he is a respected 
leader in the community and we believe he will be a true fighter on our behalf 
in the war against crime." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren has also received the backing of Los Angeles' two top police officials 
-- Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. Both said 
they are impressed with Lungren's personal integrity and staunch anti-crime 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's police supporters counter that Lungren's experience is secondhand. 
</P>
<P>
"Very frankly, the gentleman has a tremendous ego if he thinks merely being 
strong on crime in Congress is a qualification to be the attorney general of 
the state of California," declared Al Angele, executive director of the 
California Organization of Police and Sheriffs (COPS). "This is a guy just 
looking to run for some public office. He didn't get the treasurer's job, so 
now he wants the attorney general's job." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren says he is seeking the post "to try to make a difference on the issues 
of crime and drugs and gangs and public integrity." 
</P>
<P>
His lack of prosecutorial experience is not a handicap, he adds, because "the 
position of attorney general is a position of leadership, a position that 
challenges someone to make a difference . . . it's not being a prosecutor at 
large." 
</P>
<P>
With less than two months to go, polls show the two candidates neck and neck, 
with the biggest bloc of voters undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Based on appearances alone, the articulate and telegenic Lungren would seem to 
have the edge over the balding, frequently tongue-tied Smith. But neither 
candidate has been able to raise large amounts of cash for TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
In its most recent financial documents, the Lungren campaign reported $217,000 
cash on hand -- only $20,000 more than Smith. 
</P>
<P>
As the race heats up, both candidates seem as interested in attacking each 
other's credentials as in putting their own best feet forward. 
</P>
<P>
In his first post-primary press conference, Lungren, citing an 8-year-old 
audit, accused Smith of mismanaging his office. He also called Smith, 63, a 
"Rose Bird liberal," citing the San Franciscan's attendance at a 1985 
fund-raising dinner for the then-state chief justice. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Lungren unveiled his first TV ad, scoring Smith for accepting 
a plea bargain from an influential campaign contributor accused of drug and sex 
charges involving teen-age prostitutes. (The ad, which Lungren toned down after 
its initial airings, was criticized in editorials in The Times, the Sacramento 
Bee and the San Francisco Examiner as being "dirty," "exploitative" and "a 
cheap shot.") 
</P>
<P>
The Smith camp has also taken its share of shots at Lungren, accusing the 
Republican of waffling on abortion and duly noting his lack of military 
service. 
</P>
<P>
While bristling at most of Smith's allegations, the confident Lungren readily 
pleads guilty to one -- being branded a Ronald Reagan conservative. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll gladly admit to that," he said. "It shows . . . that their concept of 
mainstream California is certainly to the left of where it really is."

Debbie Mae Kershaw wants a trash compactor "really bad." That's because her 
husband, Walter, doesn't take out the garbage when she asks him to. Sometimes 
she gets so mad that she puts the trash in the middle of the driveway of their 
trilevel Mission Viejo home, so he can't get in the garage after work. "Then he 
has to get out of the car and deal with it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Garbage isn't the only thing engineer Walter Kershaw, 39, neglects around the 
house, says Debbie Mae: "I do all the housework. I dust, do the dishes, vacuum 
the floors, pick up clothes, clean the bathroom, wash the windows, scoop the 
dog poop, feed the birds and the cats. I even mow the lawn." What's so 
maddening, says the 35-year-old advertising manager for CalComp Inc., is that 
"we both have jobs, we both contribute equally to the communal bills, yet I 
contribute probably 90% of the physical labor to keep the household running." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get Debbie Mae wrong. She loves her guy Walter "until death do us part." 
They lived together for 11 years before they married last October, and she knew 
exactly what she was in for when they wed: "I wouldn't give up our relationship 
just because he's messy and doesn't do things the way I like them done. By the 
way, he does bathe the dog." 
</P>
<P>
That's probably more than lots of other men do for the women in their lives. If 
there is a gene for housework, men apparently don't have it. And if women are 
liberated, they don't seem to know from what. 
</P>
<P>
Ongoing polls by the Roper Organization indicate that women's anger at men has 
risen steadily over the last 20 years. Instead of mellowing, relationships 
between the sexes get grittier as more women work outside the home -- and find 
they still have to work inside the home as well. Husbands and lovers talk a 
good game about sharing chores, the studies show, but their actions don't match 
their words. And so women -- even self-proclaimed happy ones like Debbie Mae -- 
believe they have a lot to be mad about. For them, "having it all" means having 
to do it all. 
</P>
<P>
Bickley Townsend, a vice president of the Roper Organization, a New York-based 
opinion research firm, says a recent nationwide survey of 3,000 women turned up 
some surprising information. The more women work side by side with men, both in 
and out of the home, the less women seem to like them. 
</P>
<P>
One great source of anger is the workplace, Townsend says. Women still believe 
a "glass ceiling" and a sexist "old boy network" hold them back from making 
even greater career and financial strides. Lack of money was tops on women's 
lists of dissatisfactions in this poll, with "more money" listed as the factor 
that, above all, would make their lives better. But right below that, running a 
very close second, Townsend says, is the issue of "how much my mate helps 
around the house." 
</P>
<P>
Men who don't pitch in at home were declared by the pollsters as a "major 
irritant" and, next to money, the "single biggest source of resentment" in 
women's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Other Roper studies show that the chore men do most is grocery shopping. Next 
down the line are cooking and washing dishes. But the more unpleasant the job, 
the less men do it, Townsend says. In a sort of "real men don't eat quiche" 
syndrome, studies show that toilet scrubbing, floor washing, laundry and oven 
cleaning are things men would rather leave for the females. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder, Townsend adds, a 1990 survey for Virginia Slims reveals that 
the old cliche "battle of the sexes" sounds new again. In 1970, for example, 
only about 30% of women believed "most men are basically selfish and 
self-centered." This year, more than 40% believe that statement is true. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, almost 70% of women believed "most men are basically kind, 
gentle and thoughtful." In 1990, only 50% of women thought that statement was 
true. 
</P>
<P>
The "goodwill toward men" barometer continues to fall, Townsend believes, 
because "the women's revolution has stalled" and because women are angrier than 
men about almost everything. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend says "women are twice as likely to resent the way child-care duties 
are shared; they are twice as likely to resent how they look. They have to 
spend more time on their appearance than men." And since they're more 
time-pressured than men to begin with, because of household and child-care 
duties in addition to their jobs -- they begin to resent themselves for not 
being born perfect, so they don't have to worry about how they look. 
</P>
<P>
"Women report fewer leisure hours of time than men in every age and income 
group," she says. That's partly because they have to spend some of what should 
be their leisure time shopping for clothes, makeup, hairstyles. 
</P>
<P>
That adds up to women being angrier than men about almost every aspect of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Vasquez (not her real name) can relate to that. Vasquez, 35, runs a 
day-care center at her Canoga Park home, caring for up to six infants and 
toddlers from 7:30 in the morning until about 5 p.m. five days a week. Then she 
heads for nearby Pierce College, where she carries 15 units, working at night 
toward a B.A. degree. With all that, Vasquez says, her husband John, 42, 
doesn't share any household chores. "He feels I'm not really working because I 
work at home. If the laundry isn't done, he says I'm not doing what he calls 
'my wifely duties.' 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to the littlest things," Vasquez says, "like putting a new roll 
of paper in the bathroom when the old one runs out. He will not do it. If I 
don't do it, it doesn't get done. Yesterday I asked him for the umpteenth time 
to get a special hose he told me about, so I could bathe the dog. He'll get 
around to it, he said, and of course he never did. It's been four months now 
that I've been asking him." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez reels off her list of resentments long stored. "He has his job and 
that's all he feels required to do," she explains. "Yesterday his allergies 
were acting up and as he left for work he asked me to make a doctor's 
appointment for him. I said, 'You work at an office with a desk and telephone. 
Why don't you make the appointment for yourself?' But normally, I schedule 
everything for him. I think men are selfish and out to gain what they can for 
themselves." Vasquez did not want her real name used in this article, because 
her husband "would have a fit if he saw it." 
</P>
<P>
Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist at UC Berkeley, followed for seven years the 
lives of 50 Bay Area couples who both worked and had children under the age of 
6. Her book, published last year ("The Second Shift: Working Parents and the 
Revolution at Home," Viking Press) addresses the sources of women's anger. 
</P>
<P>
"Women work two shifts, at the office and at home, which my studies show adds 
up to an average of 13 more hours of work for women than for the men with whom 
they live. This is often seen as a woman's problem," Hochschild continues, 
"referred to as 'Woman's fatigue, woman's overload, the conflict between work 
and family.' But I argue that it is very much a man's problem because he lives 
with his wife's resentment and that resentment becomes a third party to their 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Hochschild says the women's revolution has stalled, because women's lives have 
changed very fast but men's attitudes have not kept pace at the office or at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The sad thing about the stalled revolution, Hochschild says, is that "women can 
no longer afford an unambivalent love for their husbands. They don't really 
want to be angry. They want to love unambivalently, but their resentment 
prohibits that." 
</P>
<P>
The author's research, like the Roper surveys, shows that men typically change 
the oil in the car, fix broken lamps, occasionally cook or do other household 
chores. "But in general, women do far more daily chores, especially what I call 
deadline chores that have a time element attached to them: bathing a child, 
cooking a meal, arranging doctors' appointments." 
</P>
<P>
In general, her studies show, "men have more control of their time than women 
do, both on and off the job." 
</P>
<P>
Even more perplexing, Hochschild found, is that most couples she studied really 
loved each other. "But I think men and women define love very differently. Men 
would often tell me, 'I love my wife; I brought her flowers yesterday.' Or, 'We 
made love in a wonderful way last night.' The wife would come to me and say, 
'My husband really loves me -- he made dinner for us last night.' To the man, 
making dinner was merely a task he performed. It had nothing to do with 
expressing his love." 
</P>
<P>
Hochschild says, "Good marriages have a very rich economy of gratitude, meaning 
that husband and wife each feel a lot of gratitude toward each other. In 
marriages doing poorly, each mate feels ripped off by the other one." 
</P>
<P>
What really struck her as poignant, the author says, is that "in many 
marriages, each partner was capable of giving a great deal. But what one wanted 
to give was not what the other wanted to receive. For example, a man comes 
home, worn out after a 10-hour day at the office and says, 'Honey, I gave it my 
all at work today.' He is telling her he worked especially hard to help build 
security for his little family. But the wife often delivers an ungrateful, 
scorching reply: 'Where have you been? I told you I needed you at home 
tonight.' " 
</P>
<P>
The same problems cut across all educational, ethnic and economic lines, the 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most psychologically enlightened, post-modern pairs don't seem to 
escape. Scratch the surface of a couple who have deliberately structured their 
lives to share equally in child care and household chores, and you're likely to 
find pockets of female rage. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Friedman and her husband Louis Blumberg are San Franciscans so attuned to 
the pitfalls of two-paycheck parenting that they read Hochschild's book as soon 
as it was published, after hearing about it from friends. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, 34, runs a small philanthropic institution. Blumberg, 42, is 
assistant regional director of the local Wilderness Society branch. They lived 
together for five years, married six years ago, and have a year-old son, Jacob, 
who shares a nanny with another neighborhood child whose parents also work. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going nicely, " Friedman says. "We both travel for our work, but 
one of us is always in town when the other one isn't. We both do marketing and 
we share cleaning chores around the house. It's a pretty informal arrangement, 
depending on who needs to spend time with our son. If I've spent more time with 
him on a given day, then I do the dishes while my husband reads him a bedtime 
story. If I need to be with Jacob, my husband does dishes while I put Jacob to 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband really shares the housework and parenting load. He's very concerned 
with his surroundings and he used to do 90% of the chores when he worked out of 
the home," she says. 
</P>
<P>
So far so good. But chat a little longer and the anger bubbles up. Yes, her 
husband does his share, but she bears most of the psychological load. "I'm the 
one who worries about the child, who has primary responsibility for planning 
meals, for general marketing, for keeping an overview of what our household and 
our child and even our dog needs. When Jacob gets sick, I'm definitely the 
primary call. I feel like I have the primary care-giver role for the baby, and 
I feel there is inequity in this. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have to give up the kind of focus on my career that I don't see my 
husband having to give up because we've had a child," Friedman says. "Somehow, 
my husband's need to stay late at the office always wins out over mine. That 
means I come home and relieve the care-giver. We struggle around that issue a 
lot. Louis feels he can call me any time and say he's coming home late, but in 
the nine months I've been back at work since Jacob was born, I've called him 
only once to say I need to stay late. I feel it's my responsibility to always 
get the baby. I wish it were otherwise. I also pay more attention to what the 
sitter says, to what kind of day the baby has had. On this, the eve of our 
sixth anniversary, I can honestly say my husband and I have a great 
relationship. But we have a lot of heated conversations about priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Sindel, 29, a social worker in Santa Monica, has no children but some of 
her anger seems the same. Her husband David is "great at doing kitchen-type 
things. He cooks, cleans, shops, helps with recycling. But I honestly feel the 
overall household management is my responsibility, and it's pretty sex-role 
stereotyped. He does the things I mentioned. I clean the toilets, wash the 
floors, all those unpleasant things. We're talking about all this right now. I 
feel I have to lay a guilt trip on him to get him to do the unpleasant things 
-- or else do them myself. I don't like that nagging housewife role at all. We 
have the option of getting someone do the chores we don't want to do, and just 
the thought of it is liberating." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Anaheim, Debbie Mae Kershaw's husband Walter is amazed when 
a reporter calls to verify his wife's report that he hates housework and does 
nothing to help her. 
</P>
<P>
"Does anyone like housework?" Kershaw asks with a laugh, "and if they did, 
would they admit it?" Yes, but isn't there anything he feels obligated to do to 
help his wife around the house? "I change the sheets, wash the dishes and do 
the laundry, but not on a regular basis. I am aware that in my wife's mind, the 
level of what I do is nothing. In reality, that's far from the truth. But what 
I do does not meet her definition of what needs to be done, so it has 
progressed in her mind to being nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Kershaw sounds perplexed about the whole issue, an irony noted in studies by 
N.Y. researcher Ellen Galinsky, who heads the year-old Work and Family 
Institute. "Men are getting angry too," Galinsky says. "They say any time they 
do something, it gets criticized. That's a constant theme in the workshops we 
hold. For example, a wife goes out shopping and leaves the child with the 
husband. Then she comes home and criticizes the way he handled the child. 
Sometimes she has a serious complaint, but certainly not all the time. And the 
husband begins to wonder why he should try to please her any more. The way he 
cuts carrots is wrong, the way he washes dishes or changes diapers is wrong. He 
can't seem to do anything right. 
</P>
<P>
"The wife is saying, 'Help me. But do it my way,' " Galinsky says. 
</P>
<P>
"Women also want husbands to be mind readers," she says. "They are praying to 
be rescued from all the pressures and doubts they have about leaving their home 
and kids -- but by the time husbands realize what their wives want, the wives 
are already mad." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Blumberg, husband of Ellen Friedman, agrees. At his office in San 
Francisco, Blumberg wondered why his wife neglected to tell the reporter that 
she has a meeting every other Wednesday night "and I am always home on time to 
relieve the nanny, so she can attend her meeting." Blumberg says he is "a very 
involved father" and is just as interested in the baby's day-to-day life as his 
wife is. "But Ellen worries more. I think the anxiety is more intense for her, 
and I think that's part of being a mom." 
</P>
<P>
It's a complex problem, Galinsky says, having to do with women's ambivalence 
about working and their fears about parenting, which make them feel twice as 
threatened when their husband cares for the baby in a way they're not familiar 
with. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's becoming clear that women cannot have it all and do it all. 
That's why the anger is surfacing now. The pioneering stage is over, and the 
issues are becoming much more clear and easy to speak about." 
</P>
<P>
Galinsky and others say the sands are shifting and the '90s may tell a 
different story about women's feelings about their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Already there's a chink in the solid mass of Roper Organization statistics 
which, from 1975 to 1985, showed more women each year opting for a marriage of 
shared responsibilities. From 1985 until now, the figure has been dropping. 
</P>
<P>
The Roper Organization's Townsend says this dovetails with a slight increase 
since 1985 in the number of women who say they think a "traditional" marriage 
would be the most satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend says this could mean that some women are starting to reconsider 
whether work is satisfying enough, given the barriers they encounter. "Maybe 
they are trying to decide whether they want the trade-off of work in place of 
raising their children and caring for their families," she says. Although this 
may sound heretical, Townsend says that in a recent survey, "We asked how 
satisfied women are with 15 different aspects of their lives. The top 
satisfactions were children, friends, and husbands or the men in their lives. 
Job opportunities and income ranked last of all 15 choices."

ALICE KAHN: IN 2020, THEY GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THEIR CAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The year is 2020. Baby boomers are no longer babies. They are no longer 
booming. They are what the cruel call the Senile Majority. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Miller, 70, and his wife, Bree Wellington, sixtysomething, are coming out 
of a restaurant when they hear a beggar with a synthesizer playing an old 
Beatles tune, "When I'm 64." 
</P>
<P>
Dirk starts to sing, "When I grow older, losing my brains. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Bree starts laughing. "That's not how it went. It's: 'When I grow older, losing 
my gums, many years from now -- Will ya still be sending me some turpentine, 
something, something, bottle of wine. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever," said Dirk, unplugging the car from the recharging lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, that was a great meal," said Bree. "I just love Iraqi food." 
</P>
<P>
"I know, the Date Decadence was to die for," Dirk said, switching on the 
ignition. 
</P>
<P>
"And how about that Camel Hair Pasta?" Bree said, tucking her jowls back under 
the accordion skin flap. "Remember when there was a Vietnamese restaurant in 
that same place?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," Dirk admitted, adjusting the lens on the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Bree said, opening the drug compartment. "Want a few Vitamin Es -- 
sublingual?" 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks, Hon, but they're included in my subcu pump." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to get one of those," said Bree. "There was something I wanted to 
talk to you about, but I can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
"Something about Arsenio finally being out of the house?" he said, referring to 
their youngest, Arsenio Kyle Miller-Wellington, who had finally gotten his own 
apartment. Tonight's dinner was in celebration of that event. "It wasn't my 
idea to have a kid in our late 40s." 
</P>
<P>
"That old argument again," Bree said, taking off her nails. "Look, I told you, 
I was afraid that if I waited until menopause the womb transplant wouldn't 
work. How was I to know that in two years we'd have the technology for women to 
have babies until well into their 80s?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Dirk, making a right onto Richard Nixon Parkway, "but they never 
came up with the technology for having a teen-ager in your 60s! By the way, I 
hear that with the latest research, women can continue having babies forever. 
Do you believe in birth after death?" 
</P>
<P>
"Research!" said Bree tucking her recently tucked tummy under the air bag 
sensor. "That's what I wanted to tell you about. There's some new research that 
shows that people who smoked marijuana when they were young have a return of 
memory loss from the time they smoked." 
</P>
<P>
"You're kidding," said Dirk, turning off the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"What a minute! Turn that back!" said Bree, scanning. "Damn. You lost that. 
That was my favorite song, 'California Dreamin'.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The Stones, right?" said Dirk, getting off the parkway near the new McDonald's 
Golden Ramen. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not the Stones, Dirk, you dummy. It was The Mamas. The Mamas and the -- I 
can't remember. But I know there was this one Mama who died tragically." 
</P>
<P>
"In the plane crash with Ritchie Valens, wasn't it? Or was she shot as she was 
going into her apartment at the Dakota?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sperm Donors!" said Bree. "It was The Mamas and The Sperm Donors, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Dirk stopped the car and threw up his hands. "OK, I give up. Where is it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not again, Honey?" said Bree. 
</P>
<P>
But it was understandable. It wasn't senility, it was architectural 
imperialism. Their complex looked just like every other complex in the Demi 
Moore Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Just sit tight," she said, switching on the dashboard homing computer and 
keying in the program to get to their unit at Flossmore, A Community. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk lowered the seat backs and snuggled up next to Bree. 
</P>
<P>
"While we're waiting, can you sing me a little of that song, Bunnynose?" 
</P>
<P>
He hadn't forgotten his old nickname for her, and she hadn't forgotten his. 
"Your request is being processed, Wild Thing." 
</P>
<P>
She stroked his distinguished head and began to sing: 
</P>
<P>
All the leaves are brown 
</P>
<P>
And your implant is gray 
</P>
<P>
Something, something, something -- 
</P>
<P>
If I was in L.A. -- 
</P>
<P>
California dreamin' -- 
</P>
<P>
On such a something day. . .. 
</P>
<P>
 He kissed her chin, where it was recently pulled tightest, and the efficient 
little car dinged its start-up noise and headed home.

TIMES CHANGE ALL OVER, NOT JUST IN THE CATSKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an Orthodox Jew, my family and I and quite a few others have for many years 
sent our children to the best summer sleep-away camps in the U.S.A. These camps 
are located in the Catskills. Most of us visit our children on Visitors Day, 
or, as in my case, Visitors Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
We stayed at Davidman's Homowack Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, as you reported, provided food (all that one could consume), 
entertainment and recreation. The one difference between this hotel and others 
in the Catskills is that it is strictly Orthodox and maintains Sabbath 
requirements according to Orthodox Jewish standards. Young Orthodox families 
from across the country are increasingly going to the Catskills. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the weekend of Aug. 3-5 in the mountains, our family will be 
back again next year when our kids go back to camp.

GENDER SELECTION SPAWNS ANGRY RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think it's disgusting that people want so much control over their lives that 
they don't just want a child or three children, they want to choose the sex. 
How does the (Neumanns') fourth girl feel? In essence, the parents are saying, 
"If our second child had been a boy, you would never have been born." 
</P>
<P>
I think it's a waste of money to try for a certain sex by scientific procedures 
when the money could be used to help unwanted children who have no homes or not 
enough food or medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
Parents will also be disillusioned because the child whose sex they chose will 
not necessarily bring them any more happiness than the opposite sex. The dad 
who dreams of coaching his child in Little League may have a son who hates 
sports -- and the child will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
We need to learn to either accept the children God decides to give us or 
prevent the pregnancies from happening in the first place. You either want five 
children or you don't -- regardless of their sex.

ZAN THOMPSON: FESTIVAL AT VALYERMO PRIORY SPREADS ITS HEAVENLY CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An extended family of deer lives in a box canyon just over from the monks' 
cemetery at the St. Andrew's Benedictine priory in Valyermo. A large, regal 
buck conducts his tribe down to the monks' orchards at sundown. There the deer 
get a drink of clear, clean water and munch a few apples. 
</P>
<P>
Father Werner de Morchoven gave my friend Jean Erck and me a tour of the priory 
recently. There are Golden Delicious and Red Delicious apples. Last Tuesday, 
the monks picked the King David apples in the orchard at the entrance to the 
priory grounds. They will be sold to a company dealing in pesticide-free 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
The priory was humming when Jean and I were there. The 21 monks who live there 
and volunteers are getting ready for the St. Andrew's fall festival Saturday 
and next Sunday. The event celebrates the coming of the autumn harvest on the 
last weekend in September each year. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 34th time the monks have prepared the festival. The first year, 
celebrants included just a few local families from the high desert around the 
tiny town of Pear Blossom. Now hundreds of people come to breathe the crystal 
air, play the games, eat the food and snap up the bargains. Two hundred and 
fifty volunteers help the monks make the festival a success. 
</P>
<P>
Banners embroidered and appliqued with flowers and mottoes flying from the tree 
branches give the grounds the look of a medieval village on tournament day. The 
artist who creates these is Sue Poteat, a master quilter. 
</P>
<P>
One of the popular displays among the 85 festival booths is the one showing 
Father Maur van Doorslaer's ceramic plaques. These are pure charm -- round-eyed 
angels and saints from the Old and New Testaments. Just when his admirers 
worldwide think there is not one more idea for Father Maur to turn into a 
plaque, he does. This year, he has made one of Jesus in a four-wheel-drive 
vehicle filled with young people. 
</P>
<P>
He has created four new large angels, each one representing a season. Winter 
wears a robe patterned in snowflakes, a yellow ski cap, mittens and boots and 
carries a load of wood for a cozy fire. Summer bears a sheath of golden grain, 
spring an armload of flowers and autumn the fruits of the harvest. Another new 
one is of an angel carrying one end of a luxuriant flower garland with a fellow 
angel holding the other end. 
</P>
<P>
Every time I see the plaques, I see ones I have always loved and marvel at the 
new ones. Father Maur draws and designs with the exuberance of a 4-year-old in 
a roomful of finger paints. His designs are witty, funny, touching. New also 
this year is a small angel standing on a scale and balefully rolling her eyes 
at the number it shows. 
</P>
<P>
Father Maur is a serious painter at the Benedictine Mother House in Brugge, 
Belgium, from October until June and then, "I come over here and play with 
dolls." 
</P>
<P>
Last time I saw him some days ago, he was designing and building efour-foot 
plywood replicas of his four-seasons angels to hang on the four corners of the 
booth displaying his wares. Tim Benedict is production manager of the glazing 
and firing of the plaques. He is the twin brother of Father Francis Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
The plaques are sold throughout the United States in specialty gift shops. 
Father Werner, festival chairman for the 34th time, goes to gift shows to 
explain the line of plaques to the salesmen and, I suspect, goes so they can 
see what a real monk looks like. 
</P>
<P>
The monks of this priory were missionaries in China. When they were expelled by 
the Communists in 1952, they resettled in Valyermo on this 750-acre piece of 
ground right on the San Andreas fault. With a prayerful wink to St. Andrew, 
they called their priory after him, betting he would intercede for them if an 
earthquake ever shakes their retreat. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the festival profits will go toward building a new youth center. The 
monks have city and suburban kids from all over Southern California year round 
for high desert weekends in their place of space and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will have 85 booths serving every kind of food. There will be a 
roast beef dinner, hamburgers, tacos, hot dogs, the Cafe Continental, ice 
cream, beer, wine, cookies, cotton candy. If you can't find it, ask. 
</P>
<P>
There will be an art show on a hillside and items representing 22 crafts will 
be sold by local artisans. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese tea garden will serve Oriental delicacies by the lake. A petting 
zoo will be presented by the 4-H children from Juniper Hills who show their 
perfectly manicured, polished, bathed and brushed charges to those who may 
never have seen a real farm animal. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Carvin is putting in her 34th year on the festival too. She runs the 
treasure-stuffed flea market and the bargain boutique. There will be bingo and 
face painting, and music of all kinds will fill the air. There is even a place 
for peace and quiet in the secluded center behind the ranch house. 
</P>
<P>
John West, leader and choreographer of the Valyermo dancers, will present his 
troupe in vesper celebrations Saturday and Sunday afternoons at 3:30. 
</P>
<P>
I saw my friend, the remarkable Father Eleutherius Winance, when Jean and I 
were there. He talked to us in his garden, a green oasis of grass and flowers 
with a forest of Lombardi poplars. He even has a 90-foot Sequoia that a U.S. 
Forest Ranger gave him 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Father Eleutherius, 81, is one of those who made his way out of China under 
guard almost 40 years ago. He teaches philosophy in the Claremont Graduate 
School once a week. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, he was asked to teach Medieval philosophy at Claremont McKenna, and he 
now teaches a class and conducts a seminar there. He has taught in China, 
India, Rome, Minnesota, Zaire and a number of other places. 
</P>
<P>
To get to St. Andrew's festival, which takes a little more than an hour from 
most of Los Angeles and less from the San Fernando Valley, take I-5 north to 
the Antelope Valley Freeway, then Highway 14 past Little Rock and Pear Blossom, 
then watch for Valyermo signs and proceed to the cool 3,600-foot-high island of 
laughter and music.

ERMA BOMBECK: POST CARDS SENT FROM THE VACATION'S EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems everyone was apprehensive about going on a vacation this year except 
President Bush and me. While the world was in chaos, he fished and played golf 
in Maine and I traveled to Turkey and Greece in search of anything to look at 
that was older than myself. 
</P>
<P>
I don't presume to know what kind of a time the First Family had away from the 
office, but with me, the answer to "Did you have a good time?" varied 
drastically between the time I left Greece and the time I arrived home. I 
always send myself a card to remind me. 
</P>
<P>
* GREECE (the last day of vacation): "Did I have a good time? Are you crazy? I 
am tanned, rested and stress-free. For three weeks, I have read, slept and 
eaten when I felt like it. I have met interesting people and have seen the 
antiquities of the world. I will never forget this trip." 
</P>
<P>
* ATHENS AIRPORT (the next morning on the way home): "Did I have a good time? 
Sure. Dear, you just ran over my foot with the cart. Where is Gate 41? What do 
you mean there is no place to turn in our drachmas? You want me to buy $41 
worth of chewing gum? That Turkish coffee maker will never fit under the seat. 
Don't start with me. It is 4 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
* LONDON HEATHROW (four hours later): "We did have a good time, didn't we? The 
sun and all. I cannot believe we missed our connection. No sense getting tense. 
We've got nine hours of bad food and troll seats to relax." 
</P>
<P>
* DALLAS-FT. WORTH (nine hours later): "So I look like Margaret Mead with a 
migraine. Thank you very much for sharing that. You don't look like you've just 
had a vacation in . . . help me . . . Greece, either. What do you mean the 
luggage is lost? Is that final? What does Customs want us to do? We go to what 
counter? We were just there. And then the shuttle? And we have five minutes to 
make our flight to Phoenix?" 
</P>
<P>
* PHOENIX (the first morning home): "Did I have a good time? What kind of a 
crack is that! All the clocks in the house are blinking. The yard died. 
Something smells in the refrigerator. I need to go to the store, but it's only 
3 a.m. I would do the laundry if we had our luggage. So I'll sit around and 
read three weeks of old horoscopes." 
</P>
<P>
* ONE WEEK AFTER VACATION: The pictures are back and are overexposed. They cost 
more than the national budget of Brazil. We received the card in the mail we 
sent to ourselves. It reads, "Having a fantastic time." 
</P>
<P>
My husband looked over my shoulder and observed, "The scenery is beautiful. 
Where is that postmark again?" 
</P>
<P>
"Syros," I said. "It's in Greece." 
</P>
<P>
"We should go there someday," he said. "We never take a vacation."

<P>
The other day a friend of ours was asked by his daughter, age 6, if their 
family owned the house they were living in. "Well, yeah, sort of," our friend 
replied, thinking that was the end of that. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we own it all the way down to the Earth's molten core?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you ask, sweetie?" he said, taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't have a place to live, do they?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, honey, they don't." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't have enough to eat, do they?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid not. Does that make you sad?" 
</P>
<P>
The girl nodded. "What's a human right?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Our friend started to sweat. "Human rights?" he replied. "Well, umm, they're . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
His daughter came to his rescue and said: "A lot of people don't have what we 
have. I know that." She sat there and looked at him. He suddenly remembered 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like to go to a concert?" he asked her. She thought that was a 
splendid idea. 
</P>

ATTORNEYS CALL FOR FAIR PLAY, INTEGRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are all practicing attorneys as well as Santa Monica community leaders. We 
are outraged and disgusted by the tactics of the supporters of the Elected City 
Attorney Initiative to discredit the present city attorney and to intentionally 
mislead Santa Monica's voters. We have often disagreed with our city attorney's 
positions. However, as attorneys we respect honest disagreement, provided that 
the rules of fair play are observed and the integrity of our political system 
and rights of free speech are upheld. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the elected City Attorney Initiative have trampled on fair play 
and integrity. They placed a misleading and unfair "ad" in the local newspaper 
for the Santa Monica attorney's position. Yet they know full well that our 
voters have not yet spoken on the initiative and that the position will not be 
vacant if the initiative is defeated. 
</P>
<P>
They have also unfairly maligned our city attorney by mischaracterizing his 
exercise of his personal rights of free speech as criminal. As another campaign 
maneuver, they have filed a complaint with the State Bar Assn. on these same 
grounds. These tactics show a gross contempt for fair political process and our 
democratic right of free speech. They amount to an attempt at political 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
There are significant reasons to oppose the Elected City Attorney Initiative, 
including the need to keep our chief legal adviser independent of politics and 
special interests. Whether or not an appointed or elected city attorney is 
better government is an issue on which intelligent people can reasonably 
disagree. However, there is no room for reasonable disagreement on unfair 
political tactics. The dialogue here should be on the substantive issues. Santa 
Monica voters should reject a below-the-belt campaign.

MAYOR'S OPINION OF CIVIC CENTER REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times Westside section on Sept. 13, 1990, reported on the 
Beverly Hills city manager's report on the cost of the new Beverly Hills Civic 
Center. The article was accurate as to the cost of the project escalating 
substantially over the eight-year period of its development and construction. 
What was missing in the article was the context of the Civic Center Report and 
the expression of opinions by the council members regarding the project. 
</P>
<P>
In my installation speech as mayor on April 17 of this year, I set as a top 
priority the preparation by the city manager, Mark Scott, and by our chief 
financial officer, Don Oblander, of a historical chronology of the Civic Center 
project, with specific emphasis on the escalating costs. The entire City 
Council concurred in my requesting the staff report. The purpose of the report 
was to inform the Beverly Hills community and all others who were interested as 
to how we ended up with a Civic Center costing many times more than was 
originally anticipated. The report that was presented Tuesday evening was the 
culmination of the historical review as requested by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
I expressed at my installation and I expressed again at the meeting on Tuesday 
evening that it is my personal opinion that the Civic Center, notwithstanding 
the beauty of its design and the importance of the facility as a gathering 
place for the community, especially the library and the Boat Court amphitheater 
area, is excessive in design, excessive in size and without doubt excessive in 
cost. Each of the council members has his or her own view of the project, as 
was expressed at the meeting, but I think it is fair to say that all of us 
agree that it is excessive in cost. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the excessive cost of the Beverly Hills Civic Center, the 
recent careful scrutiny of the Beverly Hills budget and forecasts for the next 
five years demonstrate that the city can afford the new Civic Center without 
cutting back any necessary services or capital improvements that are currently 
proposed. However, if the Civic Center had cost in the $60-million to 
$70-million range rather than the $120-million range, those excess funds could 
have been used in so many more beneficial ways for the Beverly Hills community 
or could have added a major additional cushion to the city's reserves.

THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN, AND PARKING GOES BACK THE WAY IT WAS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: THE COUNCIL DECIDES THAT MOTORISTS WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO FEED 
METERS UNTIL MIDNIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wiping the egg off its collective face, the Santa Monica City Council has 
quietly rolled back the extended metered street-parking hours it put into 
effect just five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'Hey guys, we should say 'Uncle' here. We really blew this one,' " 
said Councilwoman Christine Reed, who sponsored the move to scrap the new 
policy of enforcing metered parking on downtown streets until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"People were angry," Reed said. "They were swearing they would never come back 
to this city. Our own citizens were phenomenally upset . . . because what we 
did was such a dumb idea." 
</P>
<P>
And so at last week's council meeting, after acknowledging a deluge of 
complaints from merchants, residents and motorists, the council voted to 
further study its newly initiated policy. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after going into executive session and after nearly everyone in the 
audience had gone home, the members voted again -- this time 4 to 1 -- to scrap 
the policy, at least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
As fast as humanly possible, the adhesive labels advising of the extended hours 
will be scraped off or replaced with new labels restoring the previous 6 p.m. 
deadline. After 6 p.m., parking in those spots will again be free. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 2,500 meters are affected, on streets in the downtown shopping 
area, on Main Street north of Ocean Park Boulevard, and on Wilshire and Santa 
Monica boulevards from Lincoln Boulevard east to the city limit, said City 
Parking and Traffic Engineer Ron Fuchiwaki. 
</P>
<P>
Unaffected by the council's retreat, however, will be the six downtown city 
parking structures, where 3,000 metered spaces were also extended from 6 p.m. 
to midnight last month. And enforcement of metered parking on Main Street south 
of Ocean Park, which already had lasted until midnight, will not change, 
Fuchiwaki said. Fuchiwaki said police and parking officers have been instructed 
not to ticket people in affected areas during the evening. And he said city 
officials are hoping they will be able to peel off the stickers stuck on meters 
to display the new hours, so the old hours can be seen. But because the 
stickers have such strong adhesive, he said, new stickers will probably be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be making our best efforts to change the signs that we just changed, 
but it may take some time," Fuchiwaki said. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying problem is that many of the meters in question have limits 
ranging from 36 minutes to an hour -- fine for daytime shoppers, but far too 
restrictive for the diners and movie-goers who flock to the Third Street 
Promenade area at night. 
</P>
<P>
The changes may not be permanent. The council hopes to engineer some kind of 
compromise to keep metered parking at night, but in such a way that doesn't 
discourage nighttime visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Fuchiwaki said he expected the new, more permanent recommendations requested by 
the council to be completed in about one month. 
</P>
<P>
The change was approved by the council in May, but it wasn't until city 
employees started putting the new stickers on the meters in mid-August that 
merchants, their customers and residents started raising a stink. 
</P>
<P>
One merchant, Tony Minero, was so outraged with the new policy that he 
collected more than 1,100 signatures in less than five days. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I could have stood on a corner and gotten millions of signatures, 
because nobody liked it," said Minero, owner of the 2nd Street Bar &amp; Grill. 
</P>
<P>
Minero said the new policy hurt business in the few weeks it was in effect. "It 
was a mistake," he said. "They realized after a lot of noise from customers and 
merchants." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Carroll, executive director of the Bayside District Corp., which 
operates the Third Street Promenade, also hailed the council's decision to back 
off the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We think four hours (of parking) is what is needed at night," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was expected to bring the city $350,000 a year in additional 
revenue, some of that possibly to build more parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had defended the extended enforcement hours, saying the change 
was instituted not only to raise money but to help alleviate the parking crush. 
By making it more expensive to park, Fuchiwaki and other officials said, people 
would turn over the spaces more often, and maybe even walk instead of drive. 
</P>
<P>
Fuchiwaki agreed this week, however, that forcing people to keep feeding 
one-hour meters at night was bad for business.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: AVOID ESCROW IMPOUND RIP-OFFS CAUSED BY LENDER 
MISCALCULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Our home mortgage has one of those escrow impound accounts for 
payment of the property taxes and fire insurance. We have had this loan for two 
years and it has been a constant source of trouble. The lender sends us a 
statement once a year setting the amount we must pay into the account. The form 
is so complicated neither my husband nor I can understand it. 
</P>
<P>
But the amount seemed reasonable, so we went along. Then last month we received 
a letter stating there is a $562.34 deficit in our account, which the lender 
wants us to pay immediately. But there is no way we can pay that amount all at 
once. Since the lender was doing the calculations, how can they be so wrong and 
what should we do? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Escrow impound accounts are rip-offs imposed on mortgage borrowers by 
lenders who have no valid excuse for demanding lump-sum payments of account 
deficits caused by the lender. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't pay the $562.34 deficit, write to the lender explaining you can't 
pay and you want to spread the repayment out over the next year. Be sure to 
emphasize the deficit was caused by the lender's error in miscalculating the 
escrow impound account monthly payment. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you have a VA, FHA or PMI (private mortgage insurance) mortgage, which 
require escrow impound accounts, it may be possible to cancel your escrow 
impound account. Many lenders will gladly do so even though these very 
profitable accounts are major headaches for lenders due to problems like yours. 
If you have a conventional mortgage that does not require such an account, you 
may be able to cancel the account and pay your property taxes and fire 
insurance premiums directly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borrower Praises Aid of Mortgage Broker 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why are you so rough on mortgage brokers? When we recently bought our home 
we applied for a mortgage at the S&amp;L where we have had our checking and 
savings accounts for years. 
</P>
<P>
They treated us like dirt. They said we didn't qualify for a loan since we had 
recently changed jobs and didn't have six months reserves in our savings 
account. 
</P>
<P>
Then the real estate agent took us to a mortgage broker's office. She checked 
our excellent credit and within two days had our loan approved by a major bank. 
Although the payments will take about 40% of our gross income, we want the home 
badly, and I'm sure we can make the payments. Why don't you say more nice 
things about mortgage brokers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Some of my best friends are mortgage brokers, and I have no hostility toward 
them. You are absolutely correct that mortgage brokers often perform finance 
miracles because they can refer a loan to dozens of lenders. 
</P>
<P>
However, a few mortgage brokers give the industry a bad name by promising 
borrowers loan terms that they can't deliver. A few days before the scheduled 
closing date, the borrower is informed of the best available mortgage terms, 
take it or leave it. But most mortgage brokers don't use deceptive tricks like 
that and do an excellent job for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Something New in Time-Shares: Quarters 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently, I visited the summer resort at Ocean City, Md., where I 
encountered a developer selling "quarter-shares." He claims this is far better 
than time-shares. Each of four owners of a condo gets two-week intervals, which 
rotate each year so each owner gets to use the condo during different weeks 
each year. The $43,900 price is affordable to us. What do you think of this 
idea? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not much, unless you really like to spend your vacations at Ocean City, Md. 
I realize you can trade your vacation time through an interval exchange 
company, but $43,900 can buy some pretty nice vacations at other places without 
your being tied down to one location. 
</P>
<P>
Please be aware vacation property is not a real estate investment. It is the 
purchase of a place to spend your vacations. As with any vacation property 
purchase, please use only money you can afford to lose because there is no 
guarantee of any profit or even being able to get your investment out. 
</P>
<P>
Talk to most time-share owners and you will find there is virtually no 
time-share resale market. It remains to be seen if there is any resale market 
for a one-fourth interest in a vacation condo. If you would use the 
quarter-share regularly every year or trade some of your time for use at other 
resorts it might serve your purposes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Combine Tax Break With Deferral 
</P>
<P>
Q: In a recent article you explained how to use the "over-55 rule" $125,000 
home sale tax exemption when the profit is more than $125,000 and defer the 
remainder of the profit tax by purchasing a replacement home costing at least 
as much as the "revised adjusted sales price" of $150,000. But suppose only a 
$130,000 replacement home is purchased. Would this trigger tax liability on the 
entire remainder of the sale profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Please allow me to use an example explaining how a home seller can 
combine the "over-55 rule" tax exemption with a partial tax deferral. Suppose 
you are 55 or older on the day you sell your principal residence that you have 
owned and lived in at least three of the five years before the sale and you 
have never used this tax break before. 
</P>
<P>
Let's pretend your principal residence sells for $275,000 and your cost was 
$50,000, so you have a $225,000 net profit. Subtracting the $125,000 "over-55 
rule" tax exemption creates a $150,000 revised adjusted (net) sales price and a 
$100,000 remaining net profit which is potentially taxable. 
</P>
<P>
If you buy a $130,000 replacement principal residence within 24 months before 
or after the sale, Internal Revenue Code 1034 says you must pay tax on $20,000 
($150,000 minus $130,000) of your remaining profit but you can defer tax on the 
other $80,000. This home replacement tax break is available to home sellers of 
any age. For further details, please consult your tax adviser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explaining Capital Gains in Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please explain capital gains and the changes Congress is considering. Would 
these new tax laws apply to all states and does the owner's age have any 
effect? 
</P>
<P>
A: Everyone understands when you sell something, such as your house, for more 
than you paid you earn a profit. But to confuse us, Congress and the IRS refer 
to profits as capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
There are several tax law revision proposals which would tax profits from the 
sale of assets held for a period of time, such as one year, at lower tax rates 
than ordinary income tax rates. The idea is to encourage long-term investments 
in real estate, stocks and other assets by taxing these sale profits at lower 
than ordinary income tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular proposal would take long-term capital gains (sale profits) at 
a 19.6% tax rate instead of the 28% tax rate that currently applies. 
</P>
<P>
But current chances of lowering the long-term capital gains tax rate appear 
very slim, even though lowering tax rates raises revenue because then more 
investors will sell their real estate and other major assets. Unfortunately, a 
few misinformed Congress members are preventing a reduction in long-term 
capital gain tax rates. If lower capital gains tax rates should become law, 
they would apply to all states without regard to the asset owner's age. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
24-Month Time Limit on Sale of Two Homes 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently, you answered a question from a newlywed husband and wife who each 
own homes bought before marriage, which they want to sell so they can buy one 
larger home together. You said they can defer the profit tax on the sale of 
their two homes if they buy one replacement principal residence costing at 
least as much as the total sales prices of their former residences. 
</P>
<P>
You gave the example of one home selling for $100,000 and the other selling for 
$125,000, which would require joint purchase of at least a $225,000 home to 
defer the tax. I find myself in a similar situation and wonder if there is a 
time limit for selling both old residences. We use my wife's home as our 
primary residence and we use mine on weekends, as it is in a resort area. 
</P>
<P>
A: I'll presume your residence was formerly your principal residence before you 
moved into your wife's house. If your home was always a second or vacation home 
and was never your principal residence, it can't qualify for the "roll-over 
residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034. 
</P>
<P>
This tax code section says you can defer your profit tax on the sale of your 
principal residence if you buy a replacement principal residence of equal or 
greater cost within 24 months before or after the sale of your old principal 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Since you can have only one principal residence and that is now your wife's 
house, you better get busy and sell your old principal residence as well as 
your wife's house. Please consult your tax adviser to work out your home sale 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Let's Clarify Rule on Over-55 Tax Break 
</P>
<P>
Q: My girlfriend told me I must have owned and lived in my home for the last 
five years if I am to claim that $125,000 old folks tax exemption when I sell. 
But I thought you told a reader that only three years of ownership is required. 
This is very important to me because my late husband and I bought our home 
almost four years ago and I want to sell now because it is far too big for me. 
</P>
<P>
We "rolled over" almost $100,000 profit on the sale of our previous home so I 
can't afford to sell too soon and be stuck with a big tax bill from Uncle Sam. 
As I need to sell so I can enter a life-care home, is there any special law 
affecting my situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: There is so much misinformation about the simple "over-55 rule" $125,000 
home sale tax exemption, that your letter will clarify the easy rules. First, 
you must be 55 or older on the day you sell your principal residence. Vacation 
or second homes don't qualify. Second, you must have owned and lived in your 
principal residence any three of the five years before the sale. Since you 
bought your home almost four years ago, you qualify if you have lived in it at 
least three of those years. 
</P>
<P>
Third, you cannot use this $125,000 home sale tax exemption more than once. 
Incidentally, if you were married, only one exemption is allowed per married 
couple. It appears you qualify. The $125,000 exemption also applies to the 
deferred profits from the sales of previous principal residence when you used 
the "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034. 
Please consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
What Can Buyer Do About Defective Home? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I moved into a new home about 2 1/2 years ago. The builder was quick to take 
our money, but after we moved in he became a "ghost." The construction is very 
poor, cheap materials were used and any repairs are just make-shift jobs. 
</P>
<P>
My worst horror story is a weather-stripping leak under my kitchen window, 
causing the Formica back splash to tear apart from the wall, The cabinets under 
the sink smell horribly of mildew and I cannot use them. I have complained to 
the builder about many other problems but to no avail. I have a Home Owner's 
Warranty Corp. warranty, but when I contact them they skate around the problems 
and are of no help. Short of hiring an attorney to sue the builder, what can I 
do? 
</P>
<P>
A: You are very fortunate to have a 10-year warranty from an independent 
third-party company such as HOW. If the builder refuses to take care of your 
defects, HOW is supposed to step in and correct the problems. Since you have 
given up on your builder, your recourse is now against HOW. Get tough with 
them. If they don't come through, please let me know.

SPEAKING OUT: COMPROMISE CAN FULFILL NEEDS OF MAN AND BEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By RICHARD SPOTTS, Spotts, an attorney and registered lobbyist in Sacramento, 
has represented Defenders of Wildlife on endangered species and other wildlife 
issues for the past decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of debates on development and environmental issues, it is easy to 
fall into stereotyped labels of "greedy" developers and "radical" 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, these debates and attendant media coverage focus more on conflicts 
than on opportunities for compromise or consensus. 
</P>
<P>
However, the public wants both affordable housing and effective environmental 
protection, including the prevention of extinctions and the maintenance of 
bio-diversity. The challenge becomes how to reconcile development and 
environmental needs. 
</P>
<P>
To explore paths for reconciliation, it is important to understand the 
political and biological context. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, an overwhelming majority of Californians want better environmental 
protection programs and effective wildlife preservation measures. This has been 
shown through polling, market trends and passage of environmental initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Biologically, California is both blessed and burdened by its bio-diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed, because California possesses more natural communities of species than 
the rest of North America, north of Mexico, combined. This bio-diversity 
treasure trove should be considered a major natural asset for California, and 
indeed the world. 
</P>
<P>
Burdened, because California has already paid a high biological "price" for its 
rapid population growth and accelerating development. 
</P>
<P>
For example, California has more species listed as endangered and threatened 
under the federal Endangered Species Act than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
California also has more people than any other state, and gains a new resident 
every 50 seconds. California reached its first million residents at the turn of 
this century, and is now nearing its 30 millionth resident. 
</P>
<P>
With this background in mind, California is either entering an era of massive 
extinctions and loss of bio-diversity or is poised to initiate innovative 
strategies for reconciling housing and habitat needs. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the following suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
First, it is imperative that we have the will and discipline to shift from 
traditionally reactive 11th-hour environmental crises to proactive, cooperative 
environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, endangered species laws require that the listing of species be 
based on the best available scientific data. Listing is not a balancing of 
biological and economic considerations, but rather a reflection of the 
biological reality for a given species. 
</P>
<P>
However, politics often supersedes biology, and development and other interests 
have delayed listings that were biologically warranted. 
</P>
<P>
The recent federal listings of the Mojave desert tortoise population, northern 
spotted owl, and Sacramento River winter run salmon were delayed and eventually 
prompted by environmental litigation. 
</P>
<P>
During the delays, these species' populations continued to decline. Had the 
listings occurred expeditiously, as intended by law, there would have been 
greater flexibility in fashioning recovery measures. 
</P>
<P>
Another major obstacle to cooperation has been the political "gridlock" in the 
state Capitol, and Gov. Deukmejian's propensity to veto most environmental 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
Development interests decry environmental initiatives and litigation, but these 
have generally been the only avenues available to environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the State Chamber of Commerce, Farm Bureau and other interests 
have opposed funding for willing-seller habitat acquisition programs, even 
though these programs could enhance the recovery of listed species and 
legitimately reduce future listings. 
</P>
<P>
Enlightened development interests should see that voluntary habitat acquisition 
programs paid through public funds could tend to reduce land-use conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, developers and planners should know that critical habitats for 
federal- and state-listed species, along with other unique or sensitive 
habitats, are maintained on both topographic maps and computer data bases in 
the Department Fish and Game's natural heritage division. 
</P>
<P>
It is accepted that houses should not be built on earthquake faults, 
landslide-prone slopes, flood plains or in high-danger fire zones. 
</P>
<P>
Critical habitats should be added tothe locations where development is 
improper. For those landowners affected, the remedies could be either 
willing-seller acquisitions or development rights transfers by government. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the state's most 
comprehensive environmental law affecting housing developments, encourages the 
pursuit of less environmentally damaging alternatives wherever feasible. It 
also provides mitigation for unavoidable adverse impacts. 
</P>
<P>
But CEQA is activated by a proposed project, rather than by environmental 
needs. It is a reactive process. 
</P>
<P>
And mitigation is suspiciously viewed as speculative, illusory or experimental. 
If mitigation "credits" could be combined over a large region -- the 
"mitigation banking" concept -- the benefits should be more reliable, 
comprehensive and effective. 
</P>
<P>
But continued reliance on ad hoc mitigation measures applied on a case-by-case 
basis will not reverse the overall declines of California's bio-diversity. 
</P>
<P>
There is another dimension to habitat protection. It is increasingly apparent 
that the indirect impacts from projects that cause the additional fragmentation 
or isolation of habitats may be much more severe than the direct impacts from 
habitat actually destroyed or degraded. 
</P>
<P>
This is because the natural mosaic of habitats that once existed in California 
is now replaced by an artificial grid of highways, reservoirs, utility 
corridors and other developments that block necessary movement of species. 
</P>
<P>
As habitats become smaller "islands," species can become extirpated or extinct. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists should be more practical in setting their priorities to 
reflect the need for maintaining larger habitats and those of highest 
bio-diversity. The real goal should be to expand and connect habitats so that 
viable populations of species in a healthy natural community can be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Developers should work with environmentalists in promoting recovery of listed 
species and maintaining bio-diversity on public lands, because this will lessen 
the conflict over development on private lands. 
</P>
<P>
If healthy species and habitats are viewed as an amenity in enhancing the 
quality of life, then perhaps developers can market nearby protected areas or 
mitigation banks as a benefit for home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
And those developments that are beneficial for quality-of-life values may 
appreciate faster and ultimately be worth more than comparable developments in 
disputed locales or absent such amenities. 
</P>
<P>
California is at a bio-political crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration's era of conflict and stalemate may continue, or 
a wiser era may begin of cooperation and innovation on environmental 
protection. Since no one appears satisfied with the status quo, the time is 
ripe for positive change.

CONDO Q &amp; A: WHAT AGE LIMIT FOR CHILDREN TO USE LAKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, Hickenbottom is past president of the Greater Los Angeles 
chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), a national nonprofit 
research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am serving on the rules and regulations committee of a newly 
developed homeowners association. Our association has both a spa and a swimming 
lake that are enclosed or fenced. 
</P>
<P>
Our committee is now trying to formulate rules that state the ages of the 
children that will be allowed to swim unsupervised. We are concerned about 
small children using the spa even when they are supervised. We would like to 
have your advice as to the age restrictions that other associations use. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The rules that you are formulating should have been adopted before the 
swimming facilities were even opened for use. You must check with your city or 
county code enforcement officials about age restrictions, spa temperatures and 
the rules that must be enforced by the association. 
</P>
<P>
You should have the required health and safety ordinances posted at the lake 
and spa or else you are probably in violation of your local codes. 
</P>
<P>
Most community associations require that children under the age of 12 or 14 be 
accompanied by an adult while using pool and spa facilities. Consult with the 
association's insurance agent to see what effect your regulations will have on 
your insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
Spas are unsafe for young children. The temperature in the spa should not 
exceed 104 degrees. Signs should be posted discouraging spa usage by persons 
who have heart or respiratory problems, pregnant women and children under the 
age of 10. 
</P>
<P>
You may be accused of age discrimination unless you carefully research this 
matter and show that the association's restrictions are for health and safety 
reasons. Most associations that have very restrictive rules controlling the 
hours of pool usage by children are finding those rules challenged by owners 
who want to swim with their families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Laws to Restrict Terms of Directors 
</P>
<P>
Q: The condominium association where I live was formed in 1976. I believe that 
the bylaws need updating because they have led to an unduly close relationship 
to the manager/developer of the complex. The current president has served for 
over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any laws that control the length of time that a president or a board 
member can serve? 
</P>
<P>
A: I have not found any laws that restrict the length of time that a board 
member or officer may serve. I have seen some association bylaws that limit the 
number of terms that a board member may serve. I assume that is the type of 
bylaw change that you are contemplating. 
</P>
<P>
In general, it is not in the best interest of the association to have the same 
people serving for several years. Four years is not too long if the current 
board is doing a good job. On the other hand, four years would be much too long 
if the board members are not fulfilling their duties appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
Board members have a duty to make decisions based upon the needs of the whole 
association membership, not just for the benefit of the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Since you live in a resort area, many of the owners probably have another home 
as their primary residence. It may be difficult to find other people who are 
willing to serve on the board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner Entitled to Copy Mailing List 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to contact the other owners in my condominium association 
regarding the next annual meeting. I have requested the association mailing 
list from the board of directors but they will not release it to me. They say 
that they don't want to give the list out because it might be used to advertise 
my business. Actually, they know why I want the list and they do not want to 
cooperate or assist me in any way. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: You are entitled to inspect the records of your association and make copies 
for your use. There have been many lawsuits that have been decided in favor of 
the requesting owner. Several states now have laws that compel the board of 
directors to provide access to records. 
</P>
<P>
Send a letter to your board of directors requesting permission to inspect and 
copy the membership list and mailing addresses. Request that the board discuss 
and act upon this matter at the next board meeting and notify you in writing 
within 10 days after the meeting. If your board does not meet on a monthly 
basis, then send your letter to the board president, requesting action within 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Company Wants Exclusive List 
</P>
<P>
Q: I serve on the board of a condominium complex. We have recently heard from a 
management company that is owned by a real estate broker. This management 
company states that the association should sign a management contract with 
their firm and amend the association's legal documents to include the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Owners wishing to sell their condominium unit must list the unit with the 
management company. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- The management company will place the property on the multiple listing 
service. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Owners offering their unit for rental must contract with the management 
company to handle the rental of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The management company offers huge discounts on the association's management 
fee based upon units sold. 
</P>
<P>
What is your opinion? Would it be wise to revise our documents for this 
purpose? 
</P>
<P>
A: Wow! If the management company makes several sales in one month, they could 
end up owing the association money for the privilege of managing your 
association! What a deal! 
</P>
<P>
This is not a new gimmick. The owner of the management company knows that 
unless the restriction is placed in the declaration of the covenants, 
conditions and restriction (CC&amp;Rs), it can't be enforced. In my opinion, 
the amendment that it suggests would unduly restrict an owner's rights. For 
instance, if I were a real estate agent, I would not willingly give up the 
right to sell my own unit. 
</P>
<P>
Owners should have the right to select any agent they choose for either rental 
or resale of their unit. A restriction like this could end up being challenged 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
I urge you to select your management company based on the merits of their 
management ability and experience, not on the basis of a real estate license 
and the offer of projected discounts. 
</P>
<P>
If your association is definitely considering hiring this management company, 
consult an attorney who specializes in community association law.

UNITING DOWNTOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I write concerning Steven E. Flusty's "An Unbiased Look at L.A.'s Heart Finds 
It Does Have a Healthy Beat" (Sept. 2). 
</P>
<P>
I find it ironic that Los Angeles and Berlin happen to be sister cities, both 
having an invisible wall separating two economic worlds. 
</P>
<P>
But I offer a solution. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the Broadway Department Store vacated its once proud, stately building 
for its present location in the Broadway Plaza. This signaled the beginning of 
the great department stores leaving the once grand shopping corridor for better 
economic locations. 
</P>
<P>
But if the New York institution, Bloomingdale's, were wooed into opening a 
branch store in Los Angeles in an extensively and beautifully renovated former 
Broadway building, this would mean the birth of an exciting retail district. I 
think the presence of this store would attract shoppers throughout Southern 
California and many small and large businesses would want to open shops along 
Broadway as well as Spring and Hill streets. 
</P>
<P>
A Metrorail station is near completion that would connect that station with the 
basement of the old Broadway building just like there is a subway station 
connecting the Lexington Avenue subway lines to the basement entrance of 
Bloomingdale's in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
I know this can work. With the near-completion of the State Office Building, 
Ira Yellin's ambitious plans for the Million Dollar Theatre and Grand Central 
Market, and the final completion of California Plaza, the two halves of 
downtown will finally be connected, which should ultimately produce retail and 
pedestrian activity in the area.

CONVERSION CAUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a response to an article titled "Southland Hot Spot: Converting Co-Ops 
to Condos" by F. Scott Jackson and Steven Solomon (July 22). 
</P>
<P>
Cooperatives considering converting to condo should analyze carefully the 
reasons for converting and consider the major change in home ownership. For 
some it might not be the right solution after all. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to four crucial points outlined in the article: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Cooperative financing does exist for California cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Conversions could be costly in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Property taxes could be affected by a conversion. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Community control over property is significantly altered. 
</P>
<P>
There is financing available for cooperatives and individual cooperative 
shareholders needing to borrow for purchasing, refinancing or equity borrowing 
on their shares or cooperative interests through the National Cooperative Bank, 
headquartered in Washington, and NCB Savings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Federal National Mortgage Assn. (FNMA) has a secondary market 
program for housing cooperative blanket mortgages and individual share loan 
financing through which local lenders can make these loans available 
competitively with condominium loans. 
</P>
<P>
A cooperative considering converting with a mortgage on the property will find 
itself paying off an existing mortgage and each shareholder picking up a new 
individual condominium mortgage. This means that the individual owner now 
assumes personal mortgage liability as a condo owner, which the shareholder did 
not have as a cooperator. 
</P>
<P>
Property taxes may not be affected by the conversion itself if there are no 
other financial considerations involved. However, taxes may be increased when 
the first converted condominium unit is sold. 
</P>
<P>
A very careful analysis is needed to see if the increased taxes and possibly 
other expenses in the use of the property as a home will justify the ultimate 
"high" resale price if in fact home values do continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
While the rules and regulations may be the same in regards to community control 
over property, the ability to enforce them are totally different. As to 
possession of the home, the cooperative and its owners have a landlord-tenant 
relationship, thus providing the cooperative substantially greater control to 
remedy disturbing behavior than a condominium, which normally has to seek a 
court injunction to alleviate the objectionable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a conversion may have federal income tax impact both to the 
individual cooperative shareholder turned condominium unit owner on whatever 
gain is realized in the transaction and on the cooperative corporation upon 
dissolution. Both of these possibilities need to be carefully analyzed by 
experienced Internal Revenue Code practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the "white elephant" characterization of cooperatives, there are 
over half a million people living in housing cooperatives who are members of 
the National Assn. of Housing Cooperatives (NAHC). These and many hundreds of 
thousands more throughout the country are obtaining reasonably priced and 
affordable housing through housing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
They have no desire to be part of a more expensive and a less controllable form 
of mutual home ownership such as a condominium.

WANNA-BE VS. BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So our parents were the Cleavers and we wanna be the Cleavers too ('Home Sick" 
by Rhonda Bright, Aug. 26). The implication is that the only major difference 
between our parents and ourselves is that they could buy a home while we, 
through no fault of our own, can't. 
</P>
<P>
But is that really the case? 
</P>
<P>
Compared to our parents, how often do we eat out? Have our hair done? Fly to 
Vegas? Do we consider dog groomers, gardeners, fitness clubs, acrylic nails, 
car detailing, 10 major credit cards and a trendy address as essentials? 
</P>
<P>
Would we be willing to move to another state in search of the good life, 
without guarantees? Most of our parents did. Do we own at least one car, more 
likely two, that we bought new? Chances are our parents didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Face it. We're not the Cleavers. Maybe our parents weren't either. They bought 
the house they could afford, in the newly developing suburbs of L.A., the 
equivalent of Victorville or Moreno Valley today. And maybe it wasn't their 
dream home -- did we ever ask them? And maybe it wasn't as big or as posh as we 
remember it. 
</P>
<P>
Has chasing a myth made us so serious, so stressed, so focused, that we can see 
only one option? Our house must be this, and it must have that, and it must be 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if we lightened up a bit, other options would present themselves. An 
example: Why not a lease-option on a $150,000 fixer-upper in, say, Covina. 
Seriously, Why not?

ARCHITECTS PRESENT AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An educator, two Southland architects and two Los Angeles-based nonprofit 
groups have won service awards from the California Council of the American 
Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
The council makes the awards each year to people or agencies who have made 
outstanding contributions to architecture, their communities or the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Osamu A. Wakita won the "excellence in education" award for writing 
architecture textbooks now used in more than 200 colleges and universities. He 
has taught architectural and technical skills to about 10,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Arnold Ross Stalk of the Los Angeles Family Housing Corp. won the 
"community assistance" award for his efforts to provide low-cost housing. He 
has been involved in a variety of projects, from play areas for children who 
live on Skid Row to shelters for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Ander, who has worked on hundreds of Southland commercial and industrial 
buildings, garnered the "corporate architect" award for his commitment to help 
others learn more about the job of an architect. He is an adjunct professor at 
Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The "distinguished service citation" went to the design committee of the AIA's 
Los Angeles chapter for its role in shaping public policy. The group has worked 
on several local projects and also assists the city planning department. 
</P>
<P>
The historic-preservation award went to the Los Angeles Conservancy for its 
efforts to make people more aware of the importance of preserving old 
buildings.

QUESTION: Your recent column about earthquake preparedness has me wondering 
about other things I might do to be prepared. What do you suggest? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: For a deep discussion, Peter Yanev's book "Peace of Mind in Earthquake 
Country" is good. I hope everyone knows about the brief but valuable advice in 
the telephone white pages -- if not, make it a point to study them today.

Why Inspection Report Not Always Clear-Cut 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'd like an inspection report to simply put everything in black and white, 
not hedge with so many "maybes." Is that too much to ask? 
</P>
<P>
A: In a word, yes. The complexity of houses and the purposes of a home 
inspection just don't always lend themselves to simple answers. 
</P>
<P>
Take a couple of examples: Asbestos in a home is very common and not 
necessarily a problem. But it becomes a problem if it is disturbed, such as in 
remodeling. Thus a home inspector might "mention in passing" the presence of 
asbestos, but at the same time caution the client to take further action if for 
whatever reason the asbestos is disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
Another example is a cracked plumbing fixture. A cracked toilet, for instance, 
might last an eternity without ill effect. Or it might choose the occasion of 
Aunt Bertha's visit to split asunder. How would the inspector present the risk 
of a cracked fixture breaking except by spelling out the possibilities? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tired of Owning Homes With Cracked Slabs 
</P>
<P>
Q: Has anyone invented a technique to prevent slab cracks? We've had problems 
with them at the last three houses we've owned, and I'd really like to know 
that the next house won't display the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
A: One fairly recent advancement in the technology of slab construction is 
called post-tensioning. Steel cables inserted through the slab are tightened to 
hold the concrete in compression, resulting in greater strength. 
</P>
<P>
But even post tensioning is not a cure-all; such slabs may also crack. But they 
have considerably reduced risk of the cracks becoming significant. It's also 
possible that the geographical areas of your homes have been where the soil is 
expansive or unstable, which aggravates slab cracks. 
</P>
<P>
If you are nervous about slab cracks, I'd suggest you ask for a manometer 
survey of any future home you may consider, to help uncover possible 
significant slab cracks. Another technique to discover slab cracks is to strip 
the carpeting back, making the slab visible. Otherwise, you may just have to 
live with still more cracks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defining the Term for Bracing Walls 
</P>
<P>
Q: In your column on earthquake protection, I read reference to "shear bracing 
of cripple walls." What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
A: Shear bracing refers to structural reinforcement of the framing of a house 
that resists sideways motion, such as in an earthquake. The traditional method 
was with diagonal braces set into the stud walls. In contemporary construction, 
it more often refers to plywood panels placed in the walls at corners and other 
key locations to do the same thing better. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, such shear braces are hidden under the stucco or interior finish, thus 
cannot be judged on a finished house without destructive analysis. You may find 
shear braces visible in garage walls or within the attic. 
</P>
<P>
The homes with probably the greatest need for enhanced shear bracing are homes 
on raised foundations (not slabs) dating from the 1950's and earlier with 
"cripple" walls (short stud walls below the floor). 
</P>
<P>
However, even more recent homes may well benefit from added shear bracing at 
walls with large openings, such as garages below living spaces. Additional 
detailed analysis will require a structural engineer. 
</P>

HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN'S DESK IS EASY TO BUILD OR TAKE DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY EISINGER, Eisinger, author of How to Build and Contract Your Own Home, 
is a do-it-yourself authority and syndicated columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is an easy-to-build desk that has three all-important features: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- It is cut from a half sheet of three-quarter-inch plywood, sold in most 
home centers or lumber yards that find a definite market in supplying smaller 
sizes than the usual 4-by-8-footer. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- The desk top can be adjusted from 25 inches in height up to 29 inches, in 
2-inch increments, as the child grows. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- The desk is held together by only four carriage bolts, so it can be 
quickly taken apart for convenient along-the-wall storage. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the desk from a half sheet of APA plywood; we suggest you use the A-C 
grade, which has one side sanded and free from imperfections. Where the 
imperfections are visible on the C side, merely fill the seams or knot holes 
with spackle or paste wood filler. 
</P>
<P>
Note that the desk consists of only six components. Mark off and label the 
parts on your half sheet of plywood, as indicated in the accompanying 
illustration. 
</P>
<P>
A table or radial arm saw will ensure the straight cuts you need. But if you 
don't have this equipment, for a few extra dollars most lumber yards will make 
the straight cuts. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a portable electrical saw, by tacking a fence to the half sheet to 
serve as a guide you can make your own straight cuts. Use a plywood blade to 
cut down on splintering. 
</P>
<P>
With your half sheet marked off as per the layout, make the first 8-inch cut, 
labeled Cut 1, to produce the cross brace (Part D). Then rip the sheet in half 
by making Cut 2, which yields the table top (Part A) and both legs (Part C), 
plus the side braces (Part B). Rip the 3-inch-wide side braces, and all that 
remains is cutting the two legs to make them L-shaped. 
</P>
<P>
To cut the notches in the cross braces and 8-inch legs, a saber saw is the tool 
of choice; it also can be used to cut the straight interior lines of the legs. 
Incidentally, by having a 1-inch radius for the inside line of the legs, you 
can cut apart the legs without making a plunge cut. However, to make the slot 
for the inside of the legs a plunge cut is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Drill the holes for the legs and side braces, as indicated, and nail and glue 
the side braces to the top with six-penny finishing nails. Then sand off each 
part, and to conceal the plywood end grain use a paste wood filler. Sand again 
and brush on a coat of primer paint. Finish with a washable coat of latex. 
</P>
<P>
Now all you need do is to bolt the legs to the table top and slip the cross 
brace in position, as indicated.

ADVANTAGES CITED FOR EARLY-MONTH CLOSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no law that says that a real estate transaction should be closed at or 
near the end of the month. In fact, advises an executive of Chicago Title &amp; 
Trust Co., there are real advantages to closing on a house early in the month. 
</P>
<P>
"Why close at the end of the month when you have people readily available the 
first 15 days of the month?" asks Alan Prince, senior vice president at the 
Chicago-based firm, the nation's largest title insurance underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition plays a big role in the end-of-month closing, he said: Many 
first-time buyers wait until the end of the month because they've paid rent for 
an apartment through the end of the month. Another reason is that some buyers 
wait until the end of the month to earn as much interest on their savings.

CRUISE VIEWS: NEW PRINCESS LEAVES EUROPE AGOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just how big is Princess Cruises'new Crown Princess? 
</P>
<P>
So big that, at 70,000 tons, it is by tonnage the third largest cruise ship in 
the world. Carrying 1,596 passengers, it is the biggest in the nine-ship "Love 
Boat" fleet. 
</P>
<P>
So big that it turned heads at the European ports it visited this summer on its 
shakedown cruises, and made more familiar Mediterranean cruise ships look like 
mere yachts. 
</P>
<P>
But big was not necessarily better in all aspects. The crew sometimes seemed 
unhappy, the food was sometimes forgettable, and the much-touted spare design 
was not always user friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Crown Princess knows how to turns heads in port. In Odessa and 
Yalta, it attracted whole families who trooped down for a look at it. In the 
Black Sea, even the Soviet navy was checking it out from a tactful distance. 
Tied up in Istanbul, it overpowered the famous Galata Tower. Anchored off 
Rhodes, it out-colossaled the Colossus. 
</P>
<P>
Five short cruises were scheduled in Europe prior to its christening by film 
star Sophia Loren in New York City on Tuesday. These sailings, which carried a 
mix of Europeans and North Americans, helped point up the ship's strengths and 
weaknesses prior to its debut in the lucrative Caribbean winter season. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the cruise we took in August, there's good news and bad news. 
</P>
<P>
The usually ebullient Italian waiters seemed grumpy and harried, perhaps 
because European passengers -- particularly the English who arrived by the 
chartered planeload -- are notoriously poor tippers. However, anticipation of a 
high-income winter should cheer up the staff for fall. 
</P>
<P>
The food -- Italian-accented continental cuisine -- was adequate though largely 
forgettable except when special-ordered and cooked for one or two tables; then 
it was delectable. 
</P>
<P>
In the cheery pizzeria, you could get pizzas and calzone made to order (usually 
only late at night), but even the mass-produced squares served the rest of the 
day were gobbled up as quickly as they were set out. 
</P>
<P>
Italian architect Renzo Piano's much-discussed "dolphin brow" design for the 
dome high atop the ship generally seemed to work well inside and out. It will 
be repeated on sister ship Regal Princess, due to arrive next July in the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the 19-foot curved dome's glass walls and white plaster ribs surround a 
triple-use area -- the large casino with 120 slot machines, eight blackjack 
tables, a craps and a roulette table; an inviting bar and dance floor with 
before- and after-dinner live music, and a daytime observation lounge with 
windows that were, alas, not always clean due to malfunctioning automatic 
window washers. 
</P>
<P>
The pool deck, also part of Piano's domain, fared less well. The spare, 
unadorned stretch encompassing a self-service cafeteria, sunbathing deck, two 
swimming pools, a bar and a pizzeria reminded us that he is more famous for 
designing museums than residences or hotels. 
</P>
<P>
When they can't coexist with the established configuration, cruise passengers 
will inevitably rearrange it to suit themselves, settling into their temporary 
nests by shoving cabin beds together or apart, sliding lounge chairs around or 
moving seats in bars and show lounges. 
</P>
<P>
Thus did passengers, the ultimate critics of Piano's overly sparse plan, mar 
the symmetry of his pool deck early every morning when the first to arrive 
moved his lounge chair to face the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The good news -- and it's very good news indeed to people who feel cramped in 
the typical cruise ship cabin -- is that cabins and bathrooms are big and 
comfortable with lots of storage space. Every cabin on the ship contains 
features that many lines offer only in top-grade suites -- walk-in closets with 
built-in drawer storage, safes, mini-refrigerators and color TV sets with 
remote control. 
</P>
<P>
And Crown Princess prices are relatively low this winter in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
A bottom-category inside double measuring 190 square feet costs $199 a day per 
person, double occupancy, and a bottom-category outside, also 190 square feet, 
is $254 per person a day, including round-trip air fare. 
</P>
<P>
Compare this to, say, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's gigantic Sovereign of the 
Seas, where a standard inside double, measuring only 120 square feet, starts at 
$180 per person a day, and a 123-square-foot standard outside cabin is $257 per 
person per day, including round-trip air fare. 
</P>
<P>
On Crown Princess, a 210-square-foot stateroom with private balcony will cost 
$297 per person a day. The top suites, which come complete with big marble 
bathrooms and private veranda, measure 550 square feet and are priced at $412 
per person. 
</P>
<P>
Ten wheelchair-accessible cabins with wide doors, low ramps over the bathroom 
sill, pull-down shower seats and enough room to turn around in will cost $241 a 
day per person, double, for an inside cabin, $260 for an outside. Some measure 
280 square feet, others 228. 
</P>
<P>
Princess prudently elected to install a nightclub, card room and library on the 
boat deck, where views are obstructed by hanging lifeboats, leaving only 28 
cabins that have boats instead of scenery in front of their picture windows. 
</P>
<P>
The new Crystal Harmony, on the other hand, has 98 cabins with partially 
obstructed views, all of which have to be sold at reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the public rooms (which were not Piano designs) are warm and inviting, 
especially Kipling's and Intermezzo, two lounges that evoke the grand days of 
ocean liners. 
</P>
<P>
The three-deck atrium, surrounded on each level by cafe tables and chairs and 
reminiscent of a vertical sidewalk cafe, was busy night and day. 
</P>
<P>
For the gala "champagne waterfall," when dozens of bottles of champagne are 
poured to fill a stacked pyramid of glasses, it was especially effective, since 
passengers could see and photograph the action from all three levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Crown Princess will make alternate western and eastern Caribbean seven-day 
sailings this winter from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on Saturdays at prices that 
begin at $1,295 per person, double occupancy. The ship will return to Europe 
and the Mediterranean next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Quest's Ocean Spirit, a cruise ship specializing in seven-day scuba-dive 
sailings, has ceased operations as of Sept. 9. Word is that the ship will be 
purchased by SeaEscape, a Florida-based company specializing in one-day 
cruises.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: NEW MEXICO'S PUEBLO POTTERS MAKE COLLECTIBLE ART WITH FEATS 
OF CLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA FE, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers to New Mexico may delight in the fact that there are nearly 1,000 
collectible pueblo Indian potters working in New Mexico's 19 pueblos, or tribal 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Since pieces range in price and quality, there is pottery for all budgets and 
most tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Once used as practical storage vessels, pueblo Indian pottery has become a 
highly respected art form, helped partly by tourism. The change began 50 years 
ago when tourists bought the pottery as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
Modern pottery is made in shapes and decorative styles similar to that 
uncovered by archeologists at New Mexico's ancient Anasazi Indian ruins during 
the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
While each potter has a distinct style, most follow basic designs associated 
with their pueblos. The most prized pottery is from Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, 
San Juan, Acoma, Isleta, Jemez, Tesuque, Zia, Taos and Picuris (or San Lorenzo) 
pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
The work of select families, especially the late Maria and Julian Martinez of 
San Ildefonso pueblo and Margaret Tafoya of Santa Clara pueblo, signaled a 
renaissance in pueblo pottery and gave it investment value. Signed pieces can 
sell for thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary pueblo pottery is intended for decoration. Most of it will not 
hold water unless a protective coat of shellac is applied inside. Some may be 
wiped carefully with a damp cloth. Tesuque pottery is the exception. It must be 
kept completely dry or the paint will bleed. 
</P>
<P>
Styles differ, but all pueblos utilize the same centuries-old "pinch" technique 
in which the potter finds, collects and prepares local clay. 
</P>
<P>
While kneading and pounding the clay to remove impurities and air pockets, the 
potter adds a stabilizing element, such as volcanic ash, to prevent cracking. 
The potter builds the sides of the pot by adding coil after coil of clay, and 
joining the coils together by pinching. Making sides symmetrical and of equal 
thickness requires much skill. 
</P>
<P>
After the pots dry, surfaces are sanded to make them smooth for painting. Pots 
that have been fired to produce a shiny, monochromatic surface are covered with 
layers of a very watery clay called "slip." When the slip dries, pots are 
hand-polished with smooth stones until the surfaces have a glass-like shine. If 
the surface is to have both shiny and matte areas, a layer of slip is then 
added to create the matte designs. Or, polychromatic pieces are painted with 
their elaborate designs. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, pots were fired in outdoor kilns built for each firing. But some 
potters now use commercially built kilns, which offer better control over the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Modernized firing has not changed the basic quality of hand- constructed pots. 
But buyers beware: Some pieces are being mass produced from undecorated 
slip-cast, or ceramic, pots made in molds, which are then painted in the 
traditional way. Some of the designs are beautiful, but prices should be less 
than half of the hand-constructed pots. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't always easy to tell the difference. Look for irregularities that 
characterize hand-constructed pots and buy from experienced, reputable dealers. 
Ask the potter's background and request certifications of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Styles vary and include: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (made about 30 miles north of Santa Fe) and San Ildefonso pots 
(about 20 miles north of Santa Fe), which are decorated with geometric patterns 
in black on black or red on red. Contrast is often obtained by combining a 
matte and glossy finish, or by incising designs so backgrounds stand out in 
relief. Sometimes, black on black and red on red areas are on the same pot. 
Santa Clara is also famous for double-spouted wedding pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
In a related style, the pots of San Juan (about 10 miles north of Santa Clara) 
are made of polychromatic red or tan, with linear patterns incised in slight 
depressions. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, pottery from Acoma (the mesa-top pueblo about 70 miles west of 
Albuquerque) uses cream-colored backgrounds with bold geometric designs of 
burnt umber or ocher outlined with black. 
</P>
<P>
The Isleta pueblo (about 15 miles south of Albuquerque) produces a limited 
amount of pottery that resembles Acoma in shape and color, but with designs 
that are smaller and spaced apart. 
</P>
<P>
Pottery from Jemez (about 50 miles southwest of Los Alamos) also has a beige 
background, but it is covered with designs drawn in commercial black paint 
after firing. Traditional patterns are extremely intricate, often with thin 
lines creating a design that seems to ripple across the surface of the pot. 
</P>
<P>
Decorated with water paints in primary colors, pottery from Tesuque (about 10 
miles north of Santa Fe) has a rough, almost dusty-looking surface that cannot 
be touched with water. Pottery from Zia (about 20 miles south of Jemez pueblo) 
uses reddish decoration on a light tan background and is often characterized by 
a broad zigzagging line and highly stylized birds. 
</P>
<P>
Taos pueblo (about 10 miles north of Taos) and Picuris (about 15 miles south of 
Taos) produce undecorated pottery made of mica-laden clay that glitters 
slightly, giving the unglazed pots particular charm. 
</P>
<P>
Before buying, study the fine pieces exhibited at Santa Fe's Museum of Indian 
Arts and Culture (710 Camino Lejo) and the Wheelwright Museum (704 Camino 
Lejo). Both museum gift shops sell beautiful pottery at standard prices, 
ranging from $45 for a small and simple Santa Clara black-on-black bowl to 
thousands of dollars for Maria and Julian Martinez originals. The 
least-expensive Martinez pots range in price from $120 to $300 and are six 
inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
Other reputable dealers include Morning Star Gallery (513 Canyon Road), Gallery 
10 (225 Canyon Road), Dewey Gallery (74 E. San Francisco St.) and Rainbow Man 
(107 E. Palace Ave.). Packard's Indian Trading Company (61 Old Santa Fe Trail) 
has a particularly good selection of Santa Clara pottery. 
</P>
<P>
In Albuquerque, the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center's gallery (2401 12th St. 
N.W.) has a broad selection at similar prices, as does Andrews Pueblo Pottery 
and Art Gallery (400 San Felipe St., Old Town) and Palm Trading Company (1504 
Lomas N.W.). 
</P>
<P>
Bien Mur Indian Market Center -- about seven miles north of Albuquerque (at 
Interstate 25 and Tramway Road) -- on the Sandia Indian Reservation has an 
exceptional selection of pottery from all the pueblos, some appealing ceramics 
and a library of books about pottery. 
</P>
<P>
In Taos, browse and buy at Broken Arrow Gallery (222 North Plaza) and Millicent 
Rogers Museum Store (four miles north of Taos, off Route 64). 
</P>
<P>
While most pueblos have shops selling pottery at a 10% to 20% discount, city 
shops usually have larger selections. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like to meet the potters, several hundred participate in the 
Indian Market every August in Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
Many artists save their best pieces to use in competition at Indian Market. 
Most dealers and serious collectors attend the event, which is so popular with 
tourists that hotel reservations must be booked about a year in advance.

GRAND OPENING OF ISLIP RIDGE TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Completion of a new trail is always a cause to celebrate. And that's just what 
the San Gabriel Mountains Trail Builders intend to do next Saturday at the 
grand opening of the group's Islip Ridge Trail. 
</P>
<P>
The trail provides a new route from the Crystal Lake Recreation Area in Angeles 
National Forest to the top of Mt. Islip. The Trail Builders, a volunteer group 
under the leadership of Charles Jones, worked thousands of hours to blaze, then 
build, the pathway. 
</P>
<P>
Trail connoisseurs will appreciate the look -- and feel -- of a hand-built 
trail. The moderate grade, well-engineered switchbacks, rock work and the way 
the path gently crosses the land are due to the skill and hard work of many 
dedicated volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Islip (pronounced eye-slip) is not named, as you might guess, for a clumsy 
mountaineer, but for Canadian George Islip, who homesteaded in San Gabriel 
Canyon a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain is not one of the tallest San Gabriel Mountain peaks, but its 
relatively isolated position on the spine of the range makes it stand out. The 
summit offers the hiker fine views of the middle portion of the Angeles 
National Forest high country and the metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Islip has long been a popular destination for hikers. The mountain was 
particularly popular with Occidental College students, who, in 1909, built a 
huge cairn (heap of boulders) dubbed the Occidental Monument atop the summit. 
</P>
<P>
The monument, which had the name Occidental on top, stood for about two decades 
until the Forest Service cleared the summit of Mt. Islip to make room for a 
fire lookout tower. Today, the monument and fire lookout are long gone, but the 
stone foundation of the fire lookout's living quarters still remains. 
</P>
<P>
The new trail to Mt. Islip climbs the forested shoulder of the mountain, and 
intersects a summit trail that leads to the peak. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the Foothill Freeway (210) in Azusa, take the 
Highway 39/Azusa Avenue exit. Drive north on Highway 39 for 24 miles to the 
turnoff for the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. After a mile you'll reach the 
Forest Service entry station ($3 per vehicle). 
</P>
<P>
Continue another mile to the Crystal Lake Visitor Center, which is open on 
weekends from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., then a half-mile to a large dirt parking lot 
on your right and signed Windy Gap Trail on your left. 
</P>
<P>
(Next Saturday morning only, you'll be able to continue past the parking area 
another mile to Deer Flat Campground, where the trail dedication ceremony takes 
place.) 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Ascend moderately on Windy Gap Trail, which passes near a campground 
and heads into the cool of the forest. The trail crosses a Forest Service road 
leading to Deer Flat Campground, ascends some more and reaches the dirt South 
Mount Hawkins Truck Road. Cross the road and look left for the beginning of 
Islip Ridge Trail, which some of the Trail Builders like to call the Big 
Cienega Cut-off because it passes near Big Cienega Spring. 
</P>
<P>
Enjoy the pleasant trail as it ascends moderately, more or less west, through 
pine, spruce and cedar forest. A bit more than a mile from the top, Islip Ridge 
Trail turns sharply north into a more sparse alpine forest. 
</P>
<P>
The trail intersects the path coming from Windy Gap. Turn left and walk a short 
but steep distance to the top of 8,250-foot Mt. Islip. 
</P>
<P>
Dedication ceremonies for the new Islip Ridge Trail will be held next Saturday 
at Deer Flat Group Campground in the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. Breakfast 
will be provided by REI outdoor gear and clothing store of San Dimas and the 
Big Santa Anita Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast will be from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., dedication ceremonies from 9:45 
to 10:15, with a 10:30 hike along Islip Ridge Trail to Mt. Islip. For breakfast 
reservations, call REI at (714) 592-2095. 
</P>
<P>
Windy Gap, Islip Ridge Trails 
</P>
<P>

WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON FESTIVAL TURNS SKIES OVER ALBUQUERQUE INTO KALEIDOSCOPE 
OF COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had flown in balloons before, over herds of elephants and giraffes in Kenya's 
Masai Mara, and thus was familiar with the graceful ascent, the lovely vistas 
that stretch forever and the euphoric sensation that overwhelms as you float 
above the treetops. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as I learned again on a ballooning adventure in Albuquerque last year, no 
matter how many times you've been up in a balloon before, there is simply 
nothing that can compare to flying amid hundreds of other airborne pastel 
bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
We lifted off in a crowd, and I felt as if I were in the center of a moving gum 
ball machine. 
</P>
<P>
Swirling all around was a kaleidoscope of vibrant color and wild patterns. 
Several of us flew close enough to wave and greet each other in the stillness 
high above the city, and closer still to gently touch (called "kissing" in 
balloon-speak). 
</P>
<P>
As we rose higher we spread out across the vast horizon, transforming the scene 
into a stunning montage -- specks of color everywhere in the distance, the lazy 
Rio Grande winding its way through fertile fields, and a backdrop of the 
verdant hillsides of Albuquerque framed by a near cloudless cobalt sky. 
</P>
<P>
Each October, balloon enthusiasts gather here to celebrate the 207-year-old 
sport at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, to be held Oct. 6-14 
this year. Debuting in 1972 with a meager 16 balloons, the Fiesta is now the 
world's largest, with 625 entrants from 25 countries, and more than 800,000 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
During the nine-day period, there are mass ascensions each Saturday and Sunday 
mornings at 7 a.m., plus various weekday activities featuring displays of 
unusually shaped balloons, and assorted competitive events. Spectators can take 
their own balloon rides for about $150. 
</P>
<P>
One event that now takes place around sunset each day is the spectacular 
Balloon Glow. For this, the balloons are tethered to the ground and inflated. 
Flames are shot into the balloons with propane burners, lighting them from 
within. Since they go dark between blasts, the 77-acre site is metamorphosed 
into a field of giant twinkling incandescent light bulbs glowing against a 
fading sky. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago there were only 250 hot-air balloons in existence. Today, 4,000 
are scattered around the world, not all of which look like the traditional 
teardrop-shaped balloon that David Niven and Cantinflas took aloft in the 1956 
film "Around the World in Eighty Days." The latest trend is specially shaped 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
While a regular balloon can cost upwards of $15,000, the custom-designed models 
go as high as $35,000. Even at those whopping numbers there are so many 
special-design balloons that an entire afternoon at the Fiesta has been devoted 
to showing them off. 
</P>
<P>
Balloonists are a fun-loving bunch, which is obvious by looking at their 
entertaining creations. Topping the list are Chickee Balloon, a towering 
interpretation of Carmen Miranda (complete with fruit), Mr. Stork giving its 
newborn the ride of a lifetime, a huge Planter's Peanut, a jetliner breaking 
through the clouds, and a mammoth replica of the book "Chronicle of the 20th 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
There's even a witch on a broomstick hovering over a field. Yes, these oddities 
really can fly. Then again, at these prices they'd better. 
</P>
<P>
For those eager to try hot-air ballooning but who have a fear of flying, there 
is good news. Many crew members have confided that they, too, will not fly in 
airplanes. But in this sport there is no sensation of movement because balloons 
travel at the same rate as the wind propelling them. It is akin to our Earth 
hurling through space at incredible speeds, with the velocity unfelt by us 
because we take our atmosphere with us. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if you closed your eyes (which you'd be crazy to do since the view 
is incomparable), you would swear that you were still on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Experiencing a mass ascension, even from the ground, is about as close as you 
will get to stepping inside a Technicolor dream. It begins before 6 a.m. when 
thousands of people are already gathered at the dark, chilly launch site 
sipping coffee, eating breakfast burritos and watching lift-off preparations. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the balloons look like ordinary, albeit enormous, sheets of 
polyester or nylon spread over the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Gulping the cold air being pumped into them, they lay on their sides and slowly 
bulge above the milling crowd. Just walking among those lifeless yards of 
polyurethane and witnessing the transformation is worth the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Hot air is lighter than cold, and the real magic begins when cold air inside 
the balloon is heated by blasts of flame from the burners. Nudged upright by 
the hot air, the balloons rise slowly like sleepy children stretching 
themselves awake. Fully inflated these behemoths can measure up to 80 feet tall 
and 55 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, as if on cue from a cosmic conductor, the sun shoots above the 
hilltops, pouring golden illumination through the balloons. The effect is 
breathtaking, resembling hundreds of brilliant translucent gumdrops leaving the 
ground in a slow-motion dance and painting the sky with vivid colors. 
</P>
<P>
Once airborne, the balloons can't be steered, only raised and lowered by 
heating and cooling the air inside via blasts from the burners. It would seem 
that this would place the balloons at the whim of capricious winds. 
</P>
<P>
However, since air currents vary at different altitudes, it is possible to 
choose the desired direction simply by finding the height at which the wind is 
blowing where the pilot wants to fly. 
</P>
<P>
This sounds good on paper, but unfortunately there are no guarantees with this 
system. One of my recent landings was on a busy street, which could not be 
circumvented no matter what the pilot did -- since the only alternative was the 
roof of an apartment building next to it. 
</P>
<P>
At least the chase crew (those who follow on the ground in a truck to pick 
passengers up) was there when we came down, grabbing the basket and steadying 
it against any ground currents that might disrupt a smooth landing. Hey, no one 
ever said this was a dull sport. 
</P>
<P>
Once back on the ground, World Balloon Corp., the official balloon company of 
the Fiesta, will help first-timers celebrate the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
The usually farcical, always-fun ceremony includes a reading of the 
balloonists' prayer, the presentation of an Ascension Certificate -- "In hoc 
ascensium non dyspepsia" (which I assume means "I did not get sick aloft") -- 
and a slightly unusual champagne toast, which seemed more like a baptism. 
</P>
<P>
It's all great fun, and a fitting end to an extraordinary experience.

HER WORLD: BOATS ON LAKE COMO KEEP PACE WITH THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paddle-wheels cut through the waters of Lake Como as our excursion boat 
Patria neared the shore at Bellagio. Italian cypress lined the steep, cobbled 
lanes. Weeping willows trailed into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The village was a mass of pinks: blush pink azaleas and bolder rhododendron, 
pink stucco houses and venerable hotels with balconies framed in roses. For all 
I know, those merrymakers at the Pasticeria San Remo were choosing strawberry 
gelati to take to umbrella-topped tables. 
</P>
<P>
Bellagio is at the tip of the peninsula that separates Lake Como from Lake 
Lecco. We were at the dock just long enough to let a few passengers off and a 
few on, long enough for me to smile at the memory of an impromptu picnic above 
Bellagio's Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni a couple of seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
One joy of a Lake Como excursion is the opportunity to call on a dozen villages 
and towns, to tie up at their main squares and see the gestures of Saturday 
markets, the noble bell towers and the terraced villas that zigzag toward the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
On this sunny day, we cruised as far north as Gravedona and back to Dongo, 
where Mussolini was captured in 1945, when he tried to flee to Switzerland. 
Schoolchildren boarded at the stage-set port of Rezzonico, with its artful 
14th-Century castle. 
</P>
<P>
At Menaggio, where a road cuts west to Lake Lugano, tiers of stone steps lead 
to the esplanade. Half a dozen red and blue fishing boats were tied out of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Menaggio has the ubiquitous Grand Hotel of many Italian resorts. This one is 
mustard yellow with green shutters and balconies. It faces the winsome village 
of Varenna, almost three miles away across the widest part of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The paddle-wheeler Patria was built in Genoa in 1926 and plies the lake from 
April to September. Its twin -- the Concordia -- also serves the summer holiday 
crowds. With a full afternoon on the lake -- the deepest in Europe at 1,345 
feet -- there was time to enjoy the museum-piece vessel. 
</P>
<P>
I sat alone in the plush red saloon, below and at the stern, and dreamed of 
another era. Doors of etched glass swing into this cozy lounge of red-leather 
sofas and tufted ottomans, cherry wood tables, globe lamps and gilded mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
The ivory-colored ceiling is molded with patterns of flowers, tendrils and 
leaves. Inlaid wooden walls are swirled with ribbons and bows, some of lighter 
woods, some of mother-of-pearl. 
</P>
<P>
The red, white and green flag of Italy flew from the top deck, which was strung 
with festive pin lights. Showers at mid-lake left the deck glistening and the 
benches wet. 
</P>
<P>
The crew of the Patria was out of Italy's central casting: young men with 
glossy black hair, dark glasses, blazing white teeth and uniforms of navy blue 
pants topped with cabled pullover sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
With our two side-wheels spinning, we were far from the fastest boat on the 
lake. Hydrofoils and motor launches sped by on regular runs from Como and 
Cernobbio, the setting of the elegant resort Villa d'Este, which, I heard, 
would be staying open this fall and winter for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Sailboats cut in front of us. Hang gliders wafted overhead. On the far side of 
the lake, two small sightseeing planes flew low over the water. Jet-skis and 
parachute-skis joined the playground at the base of an Alpine wall. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the day, we docked at Tremezzo and called at the extravagant 
gardens of the 18th-Century Villa Carlotta. The villa, like many along the 
lake, was originally a summer home. Its owners came by boat each season from 
Como. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is open to the public. Its statuary and Gainsborough paintings compete 
with terraced acres of pines, redwoods, palms, firs and magenta rhododendrons. 
Fragrant rows of orange and lemon trees are planted near the entrance. Dripping 
fountains and stone benches appear at mossy turns. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite showpiece is an ancient wisteria that grows alongside a grand old 
pine with which it is entangled. Thick ropes of vine are twisted into knots and 
looped into lavish bows. It resembles a mighty length of driftwood, hung with 
lavender blooms. I would guess it is 40 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
There are no rooms for overnight guests at the Villa Carlotta; its ornate 
grilled gates are locked at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But just next door is the Grand Hotel Tremezzo. From a top-floor room on the 
north, you can peer into the gardens and out over the lake and, with just a dab 
of imagination, fancy that all of it is yours.

CONSUMER: STATE DEPARTMENT OFFERS HELP; 
</P>
<P>
ADVISORIES: THE BEST SOURCE FOR TIMELY INFORMATION ON DESTINATIONS ABROAD IS 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT, WHICH ISSUES REGULAR UPDATES.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not always easy for travelers to get up-to-date information on countries 
they plan to visit. 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents are supposed to alert travelers to potential hazards. Suppliers 
such as airlines, cruise lines and tour operators can provide helpful 
information, too, though their advice may be a bit self-serving. Ditto for 
foreign government tourist offices. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another key information resource available to travelers: the 
travel advisories put out by the U.S. State Department. These directives, 
issued as often as necessary and on a country-by-country basis, cover a variety 
of circumstances -- from warfare, terrorism, outbreaks of disease and lack of 
hotel rooms to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. 
</P>
<P>
"The advisories can be cautionary or outright warnings," said Nyda Novodvorsky, 
a State Department spokeswoman. "Most of the advisories are cautions that cover 
unusual travel conditions or serious health problems. We don't tell travelers 
not to go, but if they do go, to be aware of certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Warnings are more serious. In some instances, we urge travelers not to go. 
Examples would be Lebanon and Libya. In other cases, the suggestion is to be 
especially careful." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, warnings signal the threat of possible physical danger or violence 
stemming from terrorism, civil disorder or natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Each advisory is specific in whether it is cautionary or an outright warning, 
and whether the situation is life-threatening or just an inconvenience such as 
a shortage of hotel space. Advisories may also pinpoint precise areas in a 
country that pose potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the information prompting the advisories comes from American embassies 
and consulates overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"Advisories can be for a short or long period," Novodvorsky said. "Each case is 
different. We monitor events to see whether we should extend, amend or end the 
advisory." 
</P>
<P>
If the State Department views the destination as having ongoing problems, the 
advisories may extend for as long as a year. "Some African countries, like 
Kenya and South Africa, have had long-term advisories," Novodvorsky said. 
"Kenya has gone from caution to a warning for a short period, and now back to 
caution." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the State Department reissued a travel advisory for using caution 
while traveling through certain parts of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
A warning advisory on Peru was issued because of concern over possible acts of 
terrorism in connection with two Peruvian terrorist groups, the Shining Path 
and MRTA, who have occasionally targeted Americans and U.S. government 
installations for attack. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory, which was sent out July 20 and is expected to remain in effect 
until July 19, 1991, cautions primarily against travel to remote regions, warns 
of street crime in busy market areas of Lima and the possibility of incidents 
in Machu Picchu and Cuzco. In addition, hikers are advised to avoid the Inca 
Trail because of possible contact with criminals and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do go ahead and travel someplace after we've issued a warning, let our 
people know of your presence," said Novodvorsky, who suggested registering with 
the U.S. embassy or consulate upon arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Advisories aren't binding on visitors or the suppliers who offer travel to and 
within troubled areas. However, they do have an impact on bookings, tending to 
diminish travel to areas where an advisory is in effect. Not surprisingly, 
suppliers often disagree on the need for an advisory and the amount of time 
they stay in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Several tour operators offering packages to Peru believe that the Peru advisory 
is worded more strongly than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Miami-based Ladatco Tours has made no changes in its itineraries to Peru, said 
spokeswoman Annie Berk, who added that Ladatco is monitoring the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The State Department can't understate the issue," said Tammy Vu, a spokeswoman 
for Santa Ana-based Travcoa. "They have to state the maximum danger, which 
doesn't mean it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that an advisory hasn't been issued may also be used to stimulate 
travel. For example, the Israel Government Tourist Office recently issued a 
release indicating that "no travel advisory has been issued by the State 
Department concerning travel to Israel." 
</P>
<P>
In general, say suppliers, if they continue to keep their product in the 
marketplace, it's safe. "We're not going to sail in an unsafe area," said 
Dennis Fuerst, vice president of reservations for Princess Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
"We monitor the advisories, but we make our own judgment on whether we should 
eliminate or amend a tour," said Rale Edwards of El Segundo-based Olson 
Travelworld. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't proceed if we thought there was any danger. We stopped operating 
tours in Beijing and Shanghai when, based on the advisory and our own ground 
operators in China, we thought those areas were unsafe. And then when the 
problems seemed to encompass all of China, we pulled all of our tours." 
</P>
<P>
The advisory information is couched in general terms, meaning travelers have to 
evaluate the situation based on their own plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obligated to alert consumers to advisories, and we would then ask 
clients to sign disclaimers that they have been made aware of the relevant 
situations," said Sue Boucher, manager of Los Angeles-based Ferguson Gates 
Travel. 
</P>
<P>
Legal situations have arisen over consumers being made aware of advisories by 
travel agents and other members of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
If the company continues to offer the product while an advisory is in effect 
and the traveler opts to cancel, chances are that the traveler will be held to 
any cancellation penalty that becomes operative. However, this is a matter of 
company policy and, to some extent, consumer perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
To get a copy of any State Department advisory, call (202) 647-5225. This is a 
recorded announcement, but travelers can pinpoint the area they are interested 
in receiving information about and leave their address. 
</P>
<P>
Advisories may also be posted in passport offices, and are available in various 
computerized data-base services offered to the public.

YOUTH BEAT: BUDGET TREKS THAT GO A LONG WAY 
</P>

<P>
TrekAmerica will offer budget trips this winter to such warm-weather 
destinations as Mexico and Florida, in addition to a variety of Southern 
California venues. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old company that specializes in economical camping tours for 
travelers between the ages of 18 and 38, TrekAmerica was created to provide an 
inexpensive way for British youths to visit North America. It now offers 20 
programs stretching from Mexico to Alaska, with groups that often include 
Australians, Europeans, Israelis, South Americans and North Americans traveling 
together in 13-passenger vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Expenses are reduced by camping. Two people share a four-person tent. 
Equipment, except sleeping bags, is provided. Occasional nights are scheduled 
at hotels for an extra $25 per person. Participants also pay about $30 per week 
to a food kitty, which covers supplies for three meals most days. 
</P>
<P>
This winter TrekAmerica will operate: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 11-day Florida tours that depart from Miami and include visits to the 
Florida Keys, Kennedy Space Center, the Everglades, Disney World and New 
Orleans for $650 (air fare is extra on all programs). 
</P>
<P>
 -- 25-day Mexico tours that leave from Mexico City and include visits to 
Oaxaca, Puerto Escondido, Tulum, Cancun, Merida and Vera Cruz for $970. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 21-day Los Angeles-to-Mexico City programs for $770 and 46-day Los 
Angeles-to-Mexico City tours for $1,650. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 14-day tours of Baja California, departing from Los Angeles and reaching as 
far south as Cabo San Lucas, for $510. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 21-day tours between Los Angeles and New York City for $890. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 14-day tours from Los Angeles that include visits to San Diego, the 
Colorado River, Tucson, Grand Canyon, Zion Canyon, Las Vegas, Death Valley and 
Disneyland for $640. 
</P>
<P>

It's now easier for travelers to find low-cost lodging in London. In August, 
the London Tourist Board began, for a small fee, to provide an "on-the-spot" 
reservation service for accommodations at six of the city's international youth 
hostels. 
</P>
<P>
The average fee for a night's accommodation in a dormitory-style room is $18 
for travelers 21 or older. Guests under 21 are charged $15 per person. If you 
are not a member of a national youth hostel association, you also are required 
to purchase a guest pass for $2.60 per night. 
</P>
<P>
Paying for the reservation service will be most attractive to travelers who 
don't want to chance hauling their luggage to a hostel, only to find it full. 
</P>
<P>
The fee for the reservation service is $3 per person, to a maximum of $9. The

One problem faced by backpacking travelers to Australia is the large increase 
in independent hostel facilities. Some are quite good, but others don't meet 
fire and health regulations and it can be a lengthy process for the courts to 
close them. So exercise caution when choosing where to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The Queensland Youth Hostel Assn. recently announced that it has ceased its 
association with the Brisbane hostel, 390 Upper St., and is opening a new 
facility at 53 Quay St. 
</P>
<P>
The new hostel will accommodate up to 80 travelers in double and four-bed 
rooms. It's a five-minute walk from the Brisbane Transit Centre and a 10-minute 
walk from the city center. Kitchen facilities will be open to guests, and there 
will be a cafeteria and tour booking agency.

BALLPARK STORY A HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with great enjoyment Glenn Bunting's "Take Me Out to the Old Ballparks," 
Sept. 2. Having just returned from a similar "girls-only" excursion myself, I 
found the article to be an accurate reflection of our impressions as well. 
</P>
<P>
Our one-week journey began in Chicago, continued on to Detroit and came to an 
end in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Both Chicago ballparks were as exciting and magical as all the legends would 
lead one to believe. Tiger Stadium in Detroit was an oasis amid an otherwise 
depressed and depressing city -- not to mention home to the best hot dogs east 
of Dodger Stadium! 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland proved to be our most pleasant surprise. Forgiving the fact that the 
residents clearly prefer football to baseball, we found the city to be 
energetic and culturally rich.

SOUTH AFRICA: A LAND LOSING HOPE;

A HISTORIC BLACK-WHITE ACCOMMODATION SEEMED SO NEAR. TODAY CONDITIONS REMAIN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1970, when I was eight, my family left South Africa. My parents had decided 
to move to Canada, a place as far away as possible. They were not political 
prisoners, but ordinary citizens who refused to submit to apartheid's numerous 
indignities and wanted a better future for their children. After 20 years of 
living abroad, I recently decided to see for myself if a new South Africa was 
truly dawning. 
</P>
<P>
Drastic change is indeed occurring. Apartheid is dying. During my first night 
in the first black home in an all-white suburb, I could not help marveling at 
this. Only a few years ago, blacks had swept into white residential areas in 
Johannesburg and refused to budge -- much to the dismay of whites and the 
authorities. Today, these "gray spots" are permanent features in downtown areas 
like Hillboro; evidence that racial harmony -- or tolerance -- is possible even 
in close quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But frustrations still abound for blacks who wish to own land, build homes and 
live in safe areas. Blacks who want to buy homes in white areas must often do 
so through a middleman -- putting at risk their legal claims to ownership. In 
new developments like Spruitview, where blacks are, for the first time, 
"property and land owners," this victory is diluted by the inconvenience of 
second-class citizenship. This means having to wait a year or two for phone 
lines to be installed; making do without such public services as garbage 
collection, and unreliable electricity and water supplies. Most blacks live 
with these frustrations, but to my Western expectations, they seemed 
unacceptable and unendurable. In numerous conversations with friends and 
relatives, they expressed fear and concern that even in a post-apartheid 
society, the enormous black demand for housing would drive up property values, 
benefitting whites but paralyzing blacks. 
</P>
<P>
But lest the world think everything is changing, life in the townships remains 
depressingly the same. Daveyton, where I spent my early years, is one of many 
blacks townships surrounding Johannesburg. It is home to 375,000 people who 
travel 90 kilometers a day to work in "town." Returning 20 years later, I 
expected to find change. Instead, enveloped in hazy black smoke from 
coal-burning stoves, I saw the same unpaved, dusty streets where we played as 
children; the same matchbox houses, ours more dilapidated than before; the same 
small, dingy stores above which my father's clinic still exists, now occupied 
by another doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Saddest was the local "creche" -- or day-care center -- that my sister and I 
had attended as preschoolers. Inside, everything was instantly familiar. The 
same grayish walls and small desks, the same faded aprons at mealtime, the same 
starchy, unappetizing food. The principal complained of overcrowded classrooms, 
of book shortages, of parents who could not afford the fees. But they were 
proud of my having gone abroad. They made much of my university degrees -- as 
though my achievement was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
From Johannesburg, it was on to my grandparents in the Transkei. The Transkei 
is one of the so-called independent homelands created for the Xhosa peoples. 
Like the other homelands, it is supposed to be self-governing. The only 
evidence of this is the foolish requirement that foreigners need a visa. 
Otherwise, it is a distinction not worth debating. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the barrenness of Johannesburg and the Transvaal, Umtata is scenic, 
gently rolling hills dotted with colorfully painted rondavelles (mud huts). The 
setting of Alan Paton's "Cry The Beloved Country," it appears tranquil. Beneath 
this picturesque surface, however, lies a tragedy of human waste. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of young people, especially, expressions of boredom and frustration 
spoke of purposeless years attending shabby schools. Many dropped out. Others 
managed to escape to Johannesburg and work. But, as someone remarked, sex and 
alcohol were the two favorite youth pastimes -- there was nothing to do. The 
damage was visible in the mindless stares that told of quashed dreams and an 
ever-present restlessness. After three days, I felt choked by the desire to 
leave, panicked by an irrational fear that I too would become a prisoner of 
Umtata. 
</P>
<P>
From the Transkei I headed for Durban, capital of Natal Province. Natal has 
occupied a prominent place in the news lately -- most of it bad. Fierce 
fighting between rival groups representing Inkatha, the Zulu-based movement, 
and the United Democratic Front, an affiliate of the African National Congress, 
has claimed many lives in what the foreign press calls "black-on-black" 
violence. In some cases, this conflict has been painted in tribal terms, giving 
it a kind of primitive hideousness but also distorting the truth. Both groups 
embroiled in the Natal violence are mostly Zulus -- since Natal is the Zulu 
"homeland." Therefore, the fighting is motivated by political differences 
rather than tribal animosity. 
</P>
<P>
My most memorable hours in Durban were spent with a group of young "comrades." 
They began by assailing me for not being able to speak my native language, 
Xhosa. I tried to explain that having left South Africa at 8, my parents had 
decided for all us kids that English would be our language of communication at 
home and outside. 
</P>
<P>
Their dissatisfaction seemed to confirm their strong black nationalist 
feelings. They asked repeatedly why my parents had left South Africa, not 
caring so much for the reason, as questioning how anyone could abandon the 
excitement of the struggle. For the struggle was life to them. They were the 
"young lions." Defiance and danger seemed as natural to them as fear and 
humiliation under apartheid. They spoke of their fierce determination, their 
pride in their leaders, Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. They spoke of a new 
South Africa that would resemble neither West nor East, defining itself 
according to the "people's" wishes. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the rhetoric and the slogans lies a confused political landscape 
where violence and intolerance can derail the hopes of all South Africans, 
black and white. Many I spoke with felt the worst was yet to come. They pointed 
to the growing right-wing menace -- white neo-Nazi and fascist organizations 
had already begun to launch attacks against blacks. They pointed to the recent 
spate of coup attempts in the homelands of Bophutatswana, Ciskei and Venda. 
They pointed to the growing culture of violence as a means of resolving 
political differences. 
</P>
<P>
Others pointed out the immense economic challenge facing a post-apartheid 
government. The task of rebuilding an economy battered by sanctions, divestment 
and international isolation. The need to provide jobs for millions of 
unemployed and underemployed blacks. The desperate need for housing and decent 
infrastructure in urban and rural black communities. And the need to address 
the immense land disparity between blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the education crisis. In an earlier campaign of defiance, 
black children became accustomed to disruptions in schooling. As a political 
tool, boycotts and stay-aways produced some benefits -- but at great cost. The 
result is a tragically high failure rate among black matriculating students and 
a tragically low number of university entrants. During my visit, the National 
Education Crisis Committee asked that teachers work on Saturday to help 
students make up lost time. The teachers I spoke with felt even this would not 
be enough. One sadly said she had lost all hope. She foresaw another lost 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
When I think of the lost generations of youth, I am haunted by the children of 
Soweto. Those brave, defiant and determined youngsters who literally took a 
nation's destiny in hand and refused to succumb to apartheid. They are the 
children of my generation, my heroes and my teachers. Each time I think of 
their sacrifices and their struggle, I am forced to think of my own life. What 
if my parents had remained in South Africa? What would have become of me?

WANT TO DEMORALIZE THE ENEMY? AIR POWER ALONE ISN'T ENOUGH;

WARFARE: THEORIES THAT STRATEGIC BOMBING CAN BREAK THE OTHER SIDE ARE JUST 
THAT. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED DURING WORLD WAR II OR VIETNAM.

The showdown in the Persian Gulf has catalyzed the debate over the role of air 
power in warfare. The United States cannot match the Iraqi army man-for-man, 
let alone obtain the 3-1 odds military theory deems necessary for offensive 
success. Instead, U.S. military leaders hope to mass enough high-tech weaponry 
in the gulf to destroy Saddam Hussein's favorite police instrument -- his 
military -- in a short air campaign. Pundits in the media and on the Hill echo 
assertions made until last week by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael J. 
Dugan, that "air power is the only answer." 
</P>
<P>
Such claims are the current version of an argument first voiced by the 
post-World War I "air-power" theorists. While the United States has amassed an 
impressive aerial arsenal in the gulf region, the assertion that air power 
alone could "win" a war against Iraq demands an evaluation of the theories and 
the evidence that gave birth to that idea. 
</P>
<P>
The contentiousness that surrounds the air-power debate stems largely from the 
empirical evidence these arguments rely on: the campaigns of World War II, 
where air power's performance was uneven. But the theoretical basis for an 
air-power doctrine goes back to immediately after World War I. The infant air 
arms of the Great War had no real influence on the outcome. But the ability of 
bombers to overfly land and seas to drop high explosives on cities and 
industrial centers had a powerful impact on the thinking of the inter-war air 
power theorists. 
</P>
<P>
The high-flying bomber appeared to many as the optimal weapon for "total war." 
In what had become a predominantly economic-industrial contest, the bomber 
offered optimistic strategists a weapon to destroy the vital industries that 
churned out the instruments of war. Thus, the bloody and protracted stalemate 
of World War I trench warfare could be avoided. Air-power theorists on both 
sides of the Atlantic were convinced strategic bombing could bring a nation to 
its knees by targeting material and moral resources. 
</P>
<P>
From the first screams of dive-bombing Stukas, World War II offered a proving 
ground for the various air-power theories. Yet after an offensive by 3,000 
German Luftwaffe aircraft against Britain, four years of night bombing by the 
RAF Bomber Command and daylight raids by the U.S. Air Force across Germany and 
the relentless U.S. bombardment of Japan, the debate over the effectiveness of 
strategic air power is unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
Air-power theorists had grossly mistaken the impact that raining tons of 
high-explosives on civilians would have on a nation's determination to defeat 
those responsible for the bombing. Instead of demoralizing England's will for 
resistance, Germany's indiscriminate bombing of population centers bolstered 
the British nation's will for victory. The German error in misjudging British 
national resolve was surpassed only by the RAF Bomber Command's failure to 
anticipate that British bombing of Germany would prove equally 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
If strategic bombing was unsuccessful in demoralizing a nation's will to fight, 
its effectiveness in destroying the war effort of either Germany or Japan was 
even less impressive. Instead of passively accepting annihilation, targeted 
industries dispersed and decentralized. 
</P>
<P>
One need not read the 321 reports published by the U.S. Strategic Bombing 
Survey after World War II to realize that the Allied bombing offensive was far 
from decisive. That is illustrated by German industry production figures. 
Output doubled from 1942 to 1944 and reached its highest figure in late 1944 -- 
at the height of the bombing campaign. The effects of strategic bombing on 
Japan's centralized industrial base was equally unimpressive. 
</P>
<P>
The strategic employment of air power since 1945 has only reinforced the 
conclusions drawn from World War II. The primary achievement of the massive 
aerial bombardment unleashed against North Vietnam, intended to pressure Hanoi, 
only stiffened the North's resolve. Despite dropping thousands of B-52 loads on 
dense jungle and repeated bombing attacks on roadways in the North, air power 
was never able to seal off South Vietnam from the infiltration of men and 
materiel. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing campaign carried out by both sides in the Iran-Iraq War also failed 
to produce a decisive victory. The employment of missiles targeted against 
cities had little more impact than German V-1 and V-2 attacks on Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the desultory effects of strategic bombing, air power used in 
coordination with ground forces exerts a considerable influence. Luftwaffe 
operations against Poland and France in 1940, and Russia in 1941, were 
successful when employed with attacking ground forces. During the Allied 
offensive in France, air power supported the drive on Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Tactical air operations in the last 40 years have often produced the same 
results. Air power played a vital role in supporting the attacks of the British 
ground units in the fighting for the Falklands Islands. In the Arab-Israeli 
wars, Israel has always achieved air superiority, using aircraft to support the 
movement of ground forces. Although air power alone cannot win wars, it is also 
true that the side that does not have air superiority has never won a war. 
</P>
<P>
But the Israelis never use air power as an independent arm -- they coordinate 
air and ground attacks. The Israeli's realize the fundamental limitation of air 
power: It cannot seize and hold territory; only ground units can do that. Thus, 
it is in conjunction with ground forces -- to support an advance, or to hamper 
a retreat -- that air power is most effective. 
</P>
<P>
Advances in technology in the last 20 years have resulted in vast improvements 
in aircraft armament. Pilots can achieve degrees of accuracy undreamt of by the 
early air-power theorists. In an air campaign against Iraq, U.S. air attacks 
would have a devastating effect on exposed supply convoys and ground units. 
</P>
<P>
But technology plays both ways. Air-defense systems have been significantly 
bolstered by technological improvements. The Arab-Israeli wars have shown that 
so many aircraft may have to target air defenses that the aircraft will be 
unable to support the ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
Air power alone will not achieve the stated objective of forcing Hussein to 
withdraw from Kuwait. Though air power would be a fundamental component of a 
U.S. offensive, it would have to be in conjunction with ground attacks. Looking 
to air power as a self-sufficient instrument of victory to avoid American 
casualties is as illusory as the pre-World War II theory that bombers would 
obviate the need for large-scale ground warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-century warfare has not borne out the ambitions of the original 
air-power theorists, or of the modern-day adherents to air power as a decisive 
independent instrument. Air power has never proven to be the sledgehammer that 
can crush an enemy's will and ability to conduct war. It is when air-power is 
integrated as a component of a strategy that combines any number of resources 
-- military, economic, diplomatic -- to achieve specified objectives that it 
makes a real contribution to victory.

About once every 40 years, the U.S. public is titillated by the spectacle of a 
military chief being fired by his civilian superiors. The last time was part of 
the "Fancy Dan" period of the Revolt of the Admirals and a final limit to Gen. 
Omar Bradley's tolerance -- when Adm. Louis E. Denfeld was fired in 1949. And 
now it has happened again. Poor Michael J. Dugan left his post as Air Force 
chief of staff before he had time to move into quarters. When he was dismissed 
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday for displaying poor judgment, Dugan 
had been on the job fewer than three months. 
</P>
<P>
Some say: "What he said about launching a massive air strike against Saddam 
Hussein made sense, and the general scheme was not denied" -- and that may be 
true. But privates can say things generals cannot. And generals in the field 
may -- with a little more professional hazard -- say things that chiefs of 
staff cannot. It is also true that Dugan had been exhorting his troops to be 
more open with the press, and that philosophy may have contributed to his 
outspoken talk -- so outspoken, according to one account, that the interviewer 
asked him whether he really should be saying those things. 
</P>
<P>
One is reminded of the famous document in the aftermath of World War II that 
purported to be an interview with the famous ace, Lt. Roger Rudder. The three 
persons involved in this fictitious paper are the interviewer, Rudder and the 
poor public information officer. He desperately tried to salvage the interview, 
beginning each comment with "What the lieutenant really meant to say was . . ." 
(SAMPLE: "Lieutenant, what do you think of your equipment?" "If I ever catch 
the SOB who welded his lunch bucket onto my tail section, I am going to break 
his butt!" "What the lieutenant meant to say was that he is filled with 
admiration for the superb workmanship of our dedicated work force.") 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to this affair than the natural enthusiasm of a new leader. 
First there is the real problem of continuing to have Arab forces arrayed on 
the U.N. side against the forces of Saddam Hussein. Any split in the Moslem 
world is delicate and needs to be nurtured. And Arabs are not Jeffersonian 
Democrats who speak another language; they spring from a wholly different 
culture. Thus the last thing needed in this build-up stage is some direct 
reminder that the United States also has ties to Israel. Just as U.S. strategy 
against Iraq needs to be coordinated at the highest level, so do any gratuitous 
comments about a role for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The second factor has to do with targeting the person and family of Hussein -- 
including his mistress. Washington may well wish him gone from this earth, and 
that departure might be a blessing. But there is an executive order on that 
subject, prohibiting the slaying of a head of state. That also presents certain 
anomalies for the soldier on the ground. ("Son, I want you to go into that 
building and capture that Saddam feller. I know there is shooting going on, but 
for God's sake do not kill him. If you do, I have to send you to the slammer 
for 40 years.") 
</P>
<P>
A third factor lies in the role of a chief of service. In the simpler days of 
World War II, the law specified certain duties for the chief of service. In the 
aftermath of the creation of the Defense Department, Title 10 of the U.S. Code 
was changed in the late 1950s. From that point on, the law can be summarized as 
saying that the secretary of a service does what the secretary of defense tells 
him to and a uniformed chief of that service does what his secretary tells him 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
However, part of the person of a chief of service is a piece of that corporate 
entity, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I was once privileged to hear that saintly 
man, Gen. Harold K. Johnson, inform a civilian official of exactly that fact. 
He said the secretary (in this case Army) had no authority to direct what he, 
as a piece of the JCS, would say in that body. Now the law has been tightened 
again, to provide further authority for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff to speak for that body. There is little evidence that Gen. Colin L. 
Powell, head of the joint chiefs, knew of or approved Dugan's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
As a fourth point, with the changes in the law, general strategy is the 
province of the joint chiefs -- and the service chiefs defer to their chairman 
for public expressions of such strategy. Detailed strategy and operational 
matters are the province of the commanders appointed by the authorities -- not 
the service chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
So one must be very careful in a time of dwindling budgets not to accept the 
protestations of those folk, usually retired, who claim that one service can do 
everything. For some time it has been national policy that combat forces be put 
together out of building blocks provided by those services whose forces and 
equipment are best able to play that role. While there must be some redundancy 
in war, there are very practical limits to such redundancy. 
</P>
<P>
The Army is the most keenly aware of that fact -- for it must rely on others to 
get it there, by sea or air. Yet the mundane logistics tasks are often given a 
secondary role to play when competing for scarce resources against the 
glamorous facets of war -- fighting. For some time we have been putting 
together forces for particular missions. Army helicopters have been flying in 
the Navy Task Forces in the gulf; they are trained and equipped to do what Navy 
or Marine helicopters cannot.

Spare Army tanks are stocked in unit sets in Germany to make it easy for the 
air transport of troops to use them on the central front of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. While that front is changing, some of those tanks may 
become more generally available later -- Marine tanks floating near Diego 
Garcia could be called for early arrival in Saudi Arabia together with troopers 
from the 82nd Airborne Division. This is the way the system works: Task forces 
are put together from those pieces best suited to the mission and best 
available in distance. 
</P>
<P>
While this has been true for some time, the press makes it difficult when it 
reports such operations as evidence that everyone is being given a piece of the 
action because of service rivalry. It is the way things are organized now. 
</P>
<P>
There was an element in Dugan's reported comments that indicated the Air Force 
can do it all by itself. The Air Force may well play a primary role if it comes 
to combat in these circumstances -- but no one service will do it all. That is 
not the way the cookie crumbles in today's world. We need to remember this 
every time some retired Marine general says the Marines can do it all by 
themselves. Or some retired admiral says only the Navy is needed. Or some 
active-duty general says only the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
There is one final facet of this problem that engenders sympathy for Dugan. Any 
military leader must be a cheerleader. He has to express unlimited confidence 
that his team will win, and he has to express this where his troops will see or 
hear it. It is difficult for a naturally enthusiastic individual to keep in 
mind that the cheerleader side must be modified by the realities of other parts 
of his job. 
</P>
<P>
For some years now there has been a course at the National Defense University 
to train new generals and admirals in the basics of joint and allied operations 
-- a course in "jointness." As a result of congressional interest, almost all 
new flag officers go through this course. It is held four times a year. As 
these officers work their way up the chain, we can expect to see fewer public 
protestations that any one service can do everything itself -- and fewer 
mishaps of this sort.

NEW HAMPSHIRE'S UNKNOWN JUDGE: HOW TO GAUGE A MAN OF FEW WORDS?; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: JUSTICE SOUTER WILL BE A PRAGMATIST IN CONSERVATIVE CLOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

M. Fleischman, an attorney and writer in New York.

<P>
If the nomination of David H. Souter to the Supreme Court is confirmed by the 
Senate, as seems likely, the New Hampshire judge would join the court sometime 
after Oct. 1, when it begins its new term. What sort of justice will he be? The 
Times posed that question to seven people representing a variety of backgrounds 
and interest groups: 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Melich,executive director, Republican Pro-Choice Political Action 
Committee: 
</P>
<P>
He will be a very pragmatic jurist. I could see him lining up with (Chief 
Justice William H.) Rehnquist and (Justice Antonin) Scalia on some issues, and 
with (Justice Thurgood) Marshall on others. 
</P>
<P>
I think he is a man with great respect for fundamental rights, so a lot hinges 
on what he thinks a fundamental right is. But he has not given those of us who 
are pro-choice any more indication as to what he'll do than he has given to the 
anti-choice people. He has tried to separate his personal positions from the 
law, but the bottom line is that you can't separate them entirely. . . . 
</P>
<P>
My impression is that Souter is very much a conservative in the old tradition 
-- he is a libertarian. . . . But I am certainly much more comfortable with 
this man than with (rejected nominee Robert) Bork. 
</P>
<P>
Karima Wicks,research director, Capital Punishment Project, NAACP Legal Defense 
Fund: 
</P>
<P>
If he wasn't able to see that there is discrimination in his own state, then we 
aren't sure that he would be sensitive to larger civil-rights questions. New 
Hampshire isn't Howard Beach, and the minority population is small, but there 
are problems there. 
</P>
<P>
We really need more information about his views with regard to women and people 
of color. His record on civil rights is an unfinished book. 
</P>
<P>
We would also like to know more about his stand on the constitutionality of the 
death penalty. Civil-rights leaders and human-rights activists need to pay 
attention to what Souter says about the death penalty, because a lot of 
politicians use the death penalty as a way of getting tough on crime without 
looking at the social and economic causes of crime, like poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Morvillo,former chief of the Criminal Division, office of the U.S. 
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, now in private practice as a 
criminal defense attorney: 
</P>
<P>
I think . . . you will continue to have a court that is moderately 
pro-prosecution, and will not be expanding defendants' rights or personal 
liberties significantly. That wing of the court will continue to attempt to cut 
back on those rights, but I believe Souter will play a swing role. 
</P>
<P>
I don't see him as a solid vote for the right wing of the court, but he is more 
conservative than liberal. I think he will pay more attention to precedent, and 
to analyzing issues in a pure legal fashion than with regard to ideological 
biases. He doesn't have an agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas B. Stoddard,executive director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education 
Fund, the nation's largest gay-rights organization: 
</P>
<P>
It is easiest to evaluate David Souter by considering what he will not be. He 
will not be an ideologue. His views tend toward the pragmatic rather than the 
theoretical. 
</P>
<P>
He will not be a loner. However eccentric his personal habits may be, his 
professional instincts are largely conventional, even conformist. 
</P>
<P>
He will not be a leader on the court. While obviously very bright, he possesses 
neither the intellectual acumen of a Felix Frankfurter nor the political 
dexterity -- for even the Supreme Court of the United States runs on political 
steam -- of a Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, he will not be a liberal. Although he did say some things on 
the final day of his congressional testimony that surprised conservatives, his 
career to 
</P>
<P>
date evidences a distinctly conservative frame of mind, especially in the realm 
of criminal justice. What, then, will he be? David Souter will be a bland, but 
thoughtful associate justice inclined to follow the lead of the court's 
conservative majority. Like Sandra Day O'Connor, he will strike out on his own 
on occasion, but these forays will be rare in number and limited in scope. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bschorr, attorney and chairman of the litigation section, American Bar 
Assn. (which recently gave Souter its "most qualified" rating): 
</P>
<P>
I think there are going to be some surprises on both sides. I think he's going 
to be much more in the middle. I think one of the really interesting questions 
is if he's going to be a leader on the court, in the way, say, (Justice William 
J.) Brennan (Jr.) was. (Souter) is on the quiet side, and that may indicate 
that it is unlikely he will be a leader. But there are people who know him 
personally that say he is a very engaging human being, on a personal, 
one-to-one basis. And that is how he'll be dealing with the rest of the 
justices on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis N. Segal,president, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund: 
</P>
<P>
He will be a consistently regressive justice on virtually every issue of 
importance to women. 
</P>
<P>
I predict Justice Souter will cast a decisive vote to unravel Roe vs. Wade's 
formulation of reproductive choice as a fundamental right protected by the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
He will side with the employer whose "protective" regulations cost women their 
jobs. He will approve relief to victims of discrimination only in the most 
blatant cases and only with the narrowest remedies. And he will side with the 
state, upholding prosecution of pregnant women for substance dependency. 
</P>
<P>
His opinions in all contexts will look to so-called "traditional American 
values," rather than to contemporary values, for their foundation -- "mom and 
apple pie" rather than equality for women. 
</P>
<P>
The only open question is precisely where on the right-wing ideological 
spectrum Justice Souter will land. 
</P>
<P>
Michael H. Cardozo IV,attorney, law professor and descendant of Justice 
Benjamin Cardozo: 
</P>
<P>
The fact that (both Benjamin Cardozo and Judge Souter) were unmarried -- that's 
what people are talking about. Justice Cardozo lived with his sister Ellen 
until right before he went to the Supreme Court, at age 61 or 62. He was very 
conscious of the needs and interests of women. It is quite possible that 
Souter's closeness to his mother is like Cardozo's closeness to his sisters. 
Some might say Cardozo hadn't much experience because he had no children of his 
own, but he had a lot of contact with relatives' children. He wasn't removed 
from life just because he didn't have a wife and children. You can't really say 
that people who haven't married and have no children therefore have no 
experience with life. 
</P>
<P>
There are differences, of course. Souter is a somewhat athletic person -- I 
believe he climbs mountains and things. The most exercise Justice Cardozo ever 
got was to walk from his office across the street for lunch.

DISCRETION IS THE BETTER PART OF LANNAN FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We all missed it. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11, an announcement about six winners of $35,000 did not catch our 
attention. There was no media hype, no champagne, no gala, no news at 11. 
</P>
<P>
"LOS ANGELES -- The Lannan Foundation today announced the recipients of the 
1990 Lannan Literary Awards celebrating literary excellence in fiction, 
nonfiction and poetry." 
</P>
<P>
In an era of aggressive self-promotion, a private family foundation was 
guarding its own privacy, plus the privacy of its lucky winners. 
</P>
<P>
Such discretion is by Meghan A. Ferrill's design. Ferrill, since 1987 the 
director of the Lannan Foundation's literary program, is responsible for the 
selection and distribution of $450,000 annually in grants and awards. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ferrill is no paper-pushing bureaucrat. She works much like the poets 
her program serves, intuitively following the emotions and inner voices so 
crucial to literary pursuits. She believes that a poet's precarious writing 
life can be undermined by sudden celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
So before the official announcement last week, Ferrill nervously phoned Dublin 
and alerted poet Seamus Heaney to watch for a $35,000 check in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want me to do?" Heaney asked Ferrill after she explained his 1990 
Lannan Literary Award for poetry. "Do I have to come to L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
Ferrill understood Heaney's anxiety. What's the catch? Heaney was asking. 
Surely the Lannan Foundation wanted publicity, would exhibit its winners. 
Wasn't that what corporate sponsorship was all about? 
</P>
<P>
But Ferrill assured the Irish poet that he was safe from L.A.'s notorious 
celebrity worship. 
</P>
<P>
After expressing his amazement, Heaney told her how he hoped to spend his 
$35,000: "I would love to use the award to secure space and silence." 
</P>
<P>
The perfect response, the kind Ferrill loves to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what a writer really wants and needs," Ferrill explained to a reporter 
on the eve of the announcement. "Nothing's more valuable or more expensive than 
time to write." 
</P>
<P>
And that's exactly what the Lannan Literary Awards will do for Heaney and 
fellow recipients John Hawkes, Barry Lopez, Carolyn Forche, Derek Mahon and 
Peter Reading: provide time to write what they wish in their own space and 
time. 
</P>
<P>
This was business as usual for the philanthropic organization founded in the 
early 1960s by Chicago financier and former ITT Chairman J. Patrick Lannan. His 
passion for contemporary art and literature made him chairman of the board of 
the Modern Poetry Assn. Upon Lannan's death in 1983, a substantial endowment 
from his estate increased the foundation's asset base to more than $100 
million. When J. Patrick Lannan Jr. relocated the foundation's headquarters to 
Los Angeles in 1986, its literary philanthropy also expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Today, no other literary program in the United States compares to the Lannan 
Foundation's. Besides the awards program, there is a 26-volume video series of 
English-language writers and poets reading from their works, ranging from Allen 
Ginsberg to Octavio Paz. Generous funds support readings at the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center's Poetry/Literature Series, at the Beyond Baroque Foundation in 
Venice, at the Art Institute of Chicago and at the poetry series sponsored by 
the Folger Shakespeare Library and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. 
The foundation supports San Francisco State University's Poetry Center and 
provides grants for the Streetfare Journal, visual displays of poems located in 
public transportation systems nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just the financial commitment that sets the Lannan Foundation apart 
from most other literary supporters. There are no application forms to fill 
out. The Lannan style is low-key but personal -- patronage like Renaissance 
artists enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a clinical program," Ferrill emphasized. "The awards aren't 
clinical. The grants aren't clinical. I'd go crazy if I thought I had to 
conform to some sort of system. We're talking about people. It's not just 
projects or grants or applications. It's people. It's creative life. And to be 
able to support it and nurture it is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly ill-at-ease with the press, Ferrill sits uncomfortably behind her 
desk in the foundation's Westside headquarters, a converted industrial building 
that also houses gallery space. (Currently on exhibition is "18 Oktober 1977" 
by German painter Gerhard Richter and "The Tables" by New York sculptor Tom 
Otterness. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday. 
Admission is free.) 
</P>
<P>
An attractive 33-year-old with an infectious laugh, Ferrill would rather read a 
book or talk to a poet or editor than be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an amazing experience to talk to these people," Ferrill said of the 
writers she meets, "and to be in this position. Somehow, I sense that my 
grandfather would approve of what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrill describes her maternal grandfather, Lannan Sr., as "a very private 
person with a life apart from ours." She remembers growing up in a Chicago home 
crowded with poetry books. She would read these without fully understanding but 
was "intrigued by the language." After graduating from the University of Iowa 
with degrees in English literature and journalism, Ferrill spent a year in 
London on a graduate writing program sponsored by Temple University. There she 
met her future husband, Jan Peter Kooyman, and relocated in Amsterdam. The next 
three years were spent working for a Dutch publishing house and for an 
international film distribution company. 
</P>
<P>
After her grandfather's death, Ferrill's uncle, Lannan Jr., reformulated the 
foundation with the goal of increasing its philanthropic range. He asked if she 
would fly to Los Angeles and discuss initiating a literary program dedicated to 
the encouragement of English-language writing. The foundation was already 
influential in the world's art community. 
</P>
<P>
(The Lannan Foundation rescued the notorious Robert Mapplethorpe retrospective 
in Washington, D.C., after its peremptory cancellation by the J. Corcoran 
Gallery of Art.) 
</P>
<P>
But when Ferrill arrived in Los Angeles in September, 1987, there was no 
literary program, no grants or awards, no guidelines. Its staff was just five 
employees. Upon being offered the position, Ferrill asked herself, "God, can I 
do this? I've always been a reader, but what qualifies me to run a program like 
this? But then, what qualifies anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
Ferrill and her uncle agreed that the Lannan Foundation should not use existing 
program models. They would develop their own unique family style. She 
immediately began traveling to meet writers and editors. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrill also decided there would be no grant applications for the Lannan 
literary program. "Literary centers and programs are so labor-intensive 
anyway," she found, "and there's just such a heavy end on the administrative 
side that it didn't seem fair to ask them to fill out another laborious 
application." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Halpern, editor of the literary journal Antaeus, became one of her many 
unofficial advisers. Ferrill soon developed a literary network stretching from 
California to London. But as word went out that the Lannan Foundation would be 
funding projects, she began receiving mounds of letters and applications. 
Rather than simply examine them, Ferrill traveled to the sources and personally 
interviewed applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Francisco State Poetry Center had asked for this huge grant before I 
got to Los Angeles," she remembered, "so I had to go up and find out who they 
were. They wanted $65,000 to redo their catalogue for a distribution of only 
250 copies! So we gave them a grant to develop four direct-marketing mailings 
to high schools, libraries, ethnic studies programs." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to Ferrill's arrival, the Lannan Foundation had explored the videotaping 
of poetry readings. They began with Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko at the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. The tape was still in rough cut when Ferrill arrived, 
and she was horrified to discover that the commercial television crew cost the 
foundation $40,000 for an unfinished tape. Her literary budget of $450,000 
annually wouldn't survive long at that rate. 
</P>
<P>
But then she was introduced to poet Lewis MacAdams, former director of the San 
Francisco State Poetry Center and currently a video director for EZTV. She had 
been impressed by his co-direction of the documentary "What Happened to 
Kerouac?" 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt poetry is a popular art, and the Lannans are the first to 
agree with me," MacAdams explained. 
</P>
<P>
MacAdams offered to tape poetry readings for a minimal fee. The project would 
record writers reading their own work and would include an interview. EZTV's 
John Dorr and MacAdams would co-produce and co-direct. Nearly 26 volumes later, 
the series has become a major educational tool at high schools and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Ferrill met with Alan Mandell, consulting director for the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center, whose series of Monday night poetry and literature readings by 
prominent writers have become popular literary events. 
</P>
<P>
"I found Meghan to be a breath of fresh air," Mandell remembered of that 
initial meeting. "She has a kind of almost infectious enthusiasm for poetry and 
literature." 
</P>
<P>
The Lannan Foundation began endowing the LATC reading series and had a stage on 
which to tape major writers. Each reading was videotaped, an interview with the 
writer was added, and the cassettes were made available to the public for 
$29.95 through the San Francisco State Poetry Center. 
</P>
<P>
Before initiating an awards program, Ferrill conducted an intensive yearlong 
dialogue with other foundation members. What kind of an award should it be? 
Best book of poems? Lifetime achievement? How do you conduct an equitable 
decision-making process? 
</P>
<P>
Gradually a "nominations network" was created, composed of about a dozen 
professionals who serve anonymously for free. Their suggestions are fed to a 
seven-member committee, four of whom are Lannan board members. The final 
decision is left up to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't compromise," Ferrill said of the committee's nomination process. 
"There's lots of lively discussions. We're a compatible group." 
</P>
<P>
The six awards are divided into three prizes for English-language writers who 
are accomplished in their careers, and three fellowships "for lesser-known 
writers whose work we've chosen to encourage," Ferrill said. Prize categories 
are poetry, fiction and nonfiction. None of the writers know they're being 
considered for the awards. 
</P>
<P>
"I was completely blind-sided, then embarrassed because I couldn't find the 
language to express my gratitude right away," said this year's nonfiction 
award-winner Barry Lopez by telephone from his home in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"The gift sharpened my desire, my will to work harder as a writer in terms of 
my social responsibilities," he added. "It also increased my own desire to be 
more generous to younger writers." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrill's most enthusiastic comments revolve around the friendships she's 
managed to create through her position. For example, a recipient of one of the 
first literary awards was 89-year-old novelist and teacher Kay Boyle. Now 
residing in what Boyle terms "an active retirement village" in Mill Valley, her 
special award for "outstanding literary achievement" enables Boyle to complete 
numerous writing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrill visits Boyle whenever possible. "Every time I leave Kay," Ferrill said, 
"I hope I can do something, contribute something in my life. She has done so 
much in this ongoing commitment, is so thoughtful and so intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrill displays a handwritten letter from Boyle that reads in part: "I have 
been able to keep in touch with the dissident students in China. . . . Their 
appreciation to me is more important by far than if I had been awarded the 
Nobel Prize. It is such a wonderful thing when young people turn to very old 
people in understanding and gratitude, and I am glad that I have lived to see 
the day this miracle happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese students of whom Boyle wrote were thanking her for sending them 
tapes of poetry readings recorded by the Lannan Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
That's the personal touch Ferrill's work is all about.

DODGERS DO THEIR PART, 6-3, BUT STILL FALL 4 GAMES BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kirk Gibson broke out of his slump. Juan Samuel continued to emerge from his 
funk. And a solid left-handed starting pitcher appeared whose name is not 
Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite beating the San Francisco Giants Saturday night, 6-3, the Dodgers 
lost ground to the Cincinnati Reds, who swept a doubleheader from the San Diego 
Padres and opened a four-game lead over the Dodgers with 10 games remaining for 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, it's getting ugly, isn't it?" Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin said. 
"We're four games out with 10 to play? That means we have to win all 10." 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with the Dodgers watching the scoreboard, and ended with them 
shrugging as if they had lost. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to keep winning and pray that they lose," said Manager Tom 
Lasorda, who celebrated his 63rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have won three consecutive games and eight of their last 10. But 
the most important victories Saturday were the Reds', by scores of 6-4 and 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds not only have an advantage in the standings, but in the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds will play the Padres again in San Diego today, then finish at 
Riverfront Stadium with three games each against the Atlanta Braves, Padres and 
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers will play host to the Giants today, then leave for three games in 
Houston and three games in San Francisco before finishing with three games here 
against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it should be a concern that they finish at home," said Kal 
Daniels, a former Red. "They still got to play the games there, don't they? 
They don't play 1.000 ball at home, do they? They can lose three, four, five of 
those games. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it would be nice if they lost all nine." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson stared into his locker, shrugged and summed up the night by saying, 
"What can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Before 45,755 at Dodger Stadium, the slumping Gibson did plenty. He drove in 
the Dodgers' first run with a double, stole two bases, and made eight putouts 
in center field. 
</P>
<P>
He was helped by Samuel, who continued his two-week tear with three hits and 
three runs batted in, including his 12th homer. 
</P>
<P>
Tying everything together was Dennis Cook, a replacement starter for Mike 
Hartley, who is still suffering from a sore side. The left-handed Cook gave up 
one run on five hits in 6 1/3 innings for his first victory as a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
"We're running out of time . . . and it's too bad, because we're all playing 
well and having fun," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin had a single and an RBI in the Dodgers' five-run sixth inning against 
against starter Mike LaCoss and reliever Francisco Oliveras. It was about the 
only time during the night that the Dodgers could avoid looking at the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
"You try not to (watch the scoreboard)," said Samuel, batting .431 in his last 
14 games. "But the fan's reaction makes you look. I don't see how you can not 
look." 
</P>
<P>
Cook and LaCoss kept things interesting through five scoreless innings before 
Cook took matters into his own bat. 
</P>
<P>
Cook began the sixth-inning uprising with a single, his first hit as a Dodger 
but his 14th hit this season, improving his average to .326. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Harris bunted Cook to second base, then Gibson sliced a 3-and-1 pitch 
against the left-field fence for a double, scoring Cook. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gibson's second hit of the game, but only his fifth in 39 at-bats and 
fourth RBI this month. He has only three multi-hit games since Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if being benched for six games helped him regain his swing, Gibson 
shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say. . . . I was out of the lineup, we played well and won, that is 
water over the dam, it's nothing to be dwelt on," he said. "Who knows, maybe 
I'll have to be sitting in the future." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Sometimes you hit the ball well and it doesn't fall in. Everybody 
says I was in a slump, well, there have been other days I have felt better than 
I did tonight. Just because I get a couple of hits, does that mean I found my 
swing?" 
</P>
<P>
On the next pitch after his double, with Kal Daniels batting, Gibson stole 
third base. It was his second steal of the game, and his 25th in 27 attempts 
this season. That steal seemed to bother LaCoss, who walked Daniels, and then 
walked Eddie Murray on four pitches to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Murray went hitless in two at-bats to end a 10-game hitting streak. His average 
dropped to .328. 
</P>
<P>
A grounder by Hubie Brooks scored one run. After an intentional walk to Mike 
Scioscia loaded the bases, Samuel bounced a single up the middle to score two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
LaCoss was replaced by Oliveras, who gave up a bloop single to left by Griffin 
to score the Dodgers' fifth run. It was only Griffin's 35th RBI this season. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda celebrated his 63rd birthday with a singing telegram from a 
woman dressed like a police officer, a cake shaped like a baseball, and a 
100-lap swim. Lasorda, who had been promising for two months to make the 
marathon swim on his birthday, completed the 100 laps at the Police Academy 
Pool in 2 1/2 hours. He took a 10-second rest after every two laps. . . . Orel 
Hershiser threw about 35 pitches off a mound at the regulation distance of 60 
feet 6 inches for the first time since undergoing shoulder surgery Aug. 27. 
Hershiser said he will probably not do much more before this winter. "If 
anything, I'm going to back off," he said. Hershiser said he will spend the 
winter in the Southland instead of returning to his Vero Beach home so he can 
be near team therapist Pat Screnar. 
</P>
<P>
Robby Thompson, Giant second baseman, will miss this series because he has 
returned to San Francisco to care for his wife, Brenda, who suffered broken 
ribs and a broken clavicle in an auto accident last week. Thompson was hitting 
.278 against the Dodgers this season, and .244 overall. . . . The Giants have 
used 51 players this season, three short of the National League record of 54 
used by the New York Mets in 1967. The Giants have also used 26 pitchers, one 
short of the major league mark of 27 shared by three teams, most recently the 
1967 Mets. The Giants have used the disabled list 15 times this year, a 
franchise record and the most in the league. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for newly acquired catcher Barry Lyons, the Dodgers designated 
pitcher Mike Munoz for assignment. Munoz, a left-handed reliever who was once 
one of the Dodgers' top prospects, must be either traded, released or waived 
within 10 days. Munoz appeared in 11 games for the Dodgers in two seasons, 
giving up seven runs in 8 1/3 innings.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TROJANS' 31-0 LOSS ENDS THEIR 20-GAME UNBEATEN STREAK AGAINST 
PACIFIC 10 OPPONENTS.

<P>
With less than a minute left in the first half of Saturday's game in Husky 
Stadium, USC quarterback Todd Marinovich pleaded with the officials to quiet a 
sellout crowd of 72,617. 
</P>
<P>
It was a futile act of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the favored Trojans trailed by 24 points in what was to become a 
31-0 loss to Washington. It ended USC's 20-game unbeaten streak against Pacific 
10 Conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"We never did anything to shut the crowd up, so they were yelling the whole 
game," Marinovich said later. 
</P>
<P>
USC's only solace was that it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
Washington kicker Mike Dodd missed a 34-yard field-goal attempt in the second 
quarter and an interception by USC's Howard McCowan ended a third-quarter drive 
that had reached the Trojans' nine-yard line before a holding penalty cost the 
Huskies 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, the loss was the Trojans' worst since October, 1985, when they were 
beaten at Notre Dame, 37-3, en route to a 6-6 season, and their worst shutout 
loss since November, 1966, when they lost to Notre Dame, 51-0. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat was the Trojans' worst in a conference game since 1960, when they 
lost to Washington, 34-0, in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
USC had not lost a Pac-10 game since Oct. 10, 1987, when it was beaten by 
Oregon at Eugene, 34-27, and was 21-1-1 against conference opponents in its 
first three seasons under Coach Larry Smith. 
</P>
<P>
But against a team that struggled to beat San Jose State and Purdue in its 
first two games, the Trojans were ineffective offensively, inept defensively 
and didn't even threaten to score until the fourth quarter, by which time 
Washington had completed its onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich called it a "pathetic" showing by USC. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it was Marinovich's worst day in 15 games as the Trojans' starting 
quarterback. He completed seven of 16 passes for 80 yards and threw his first 
two interceptions of the season. Never had he thrown for fewer yards, completed 
fewer passes or made fewer attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at the start of the fourth quarter, Smith replaced him with Shane 
Foley for the last 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich responded by removing his helmet and kicking it. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, he hid behind sunglasses as he met with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of day. 
</P>
<P>
While Marinovich was in the game, the Trojans crossed midfield only once, 
reaching the Huskies' 45-yard line early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Marinovich was sacked for a nine-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't do anything right," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington had a substantial statistical advantage, piling up 410 total yards 
to the Trojans' 163, as sophomore quarterback Mark Brunell passed for 197 yards 
and a touchdown, completing 12 of 23 attempts with one interception in the most 
productive of his three starts, and tailback Greg Lewis ran for 126 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
USC ran for 28 yards, its worst rushing day since October, 1982, when it gained 
20 in a 17-10 loss at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
When it was suggested to Smith that USC's offensive line opened no holes for 
tailback Ricky Ervins, who carried nine times for five yards, Smith said: 
"There weren't any holes for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Or any Trojans, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"They just beat our butt bad," Marinovich said. 
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, USC was penalized 13 times for 111 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been beaten like this in my life," said Trojan linebacker Scott 
Ross, whose first three seasons at USC ended in the Rose Bowl. "This is the 
most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
On the hottest Sept. 22 in Seattle history -- the high was 92 degrees -- 
Washington dominated from the start, driving 66 yards to a touchdown in its 
second possession to open a 7-0 lead on a one-yard run by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
USC managed only two first downs in the first half, and didn't get its first 
until 11:36 remained in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Washington had extended its lead to 10-0 on a 21-yard field goal 
by Dodd, who missed from 26 yards on the previous play but was given a second 
chance when USC was called for encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich didn't complete a pass until the last play of the first quarter, 
connecting with split end Joel Scott for a five-yard gain that increased USC's 
offensive output for the quarter to seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
Washington gained 120 yards in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the first play in the second quarter, Marinovich threw an 
interception, his first in 100 attempts since the first quarter of the Rose 
Bowl game against Michigan last January. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Briscoe returned it to USC's 26-yard line, but Washington was unable to 
gain a first down and Dodd missed a 38-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
It mattered little, however, because on their next possession, the Huskies 
drove 80 yards in 14 plays, scoring on a one-yard run by fullback Darius Turner 
to increase their lead to 17-0 with 2:54 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich then threw another interception, this one by safety Tommie Smith 
with 2:40 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Huskies capitalized on the error, scoring on a 12-yard pass for 
a touchdown from Brunell to Bailey to make it 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
It never got better for the Trojans, who had lost their conference opener only 
twice in the previous 19 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Washington added another touchdown with 1:06 left in the third quarter, when 
Turner scored on a one-yard run to cap an 80-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody had told me it was going to be 31-0, I'd have thought that they'd 
have the points," Washington Coach Don James said of the Trojans, "and we'd 
have zero." 
</P>
<P>
Are the Huskies that good? 
</P>
<P>
"They were today," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
And USC was that bad. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Backup quarterback Shane Foley completed four of nine passes for 55 yards and 
carried five times for 35 yards, twice moving USC inside Washington's 10-yard 
line in the fourth quarter. The first time, Foley threw an interception and the 
second time he threw incomplete on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
No player had rushed for more than 100 yards against USC since Jan. 2, 1989, 
when Leroy Hoard of Michigan ran for 142 yards in a 22-14 Wolverine victory in 
the Rose Bowl game.

<P>
The Phoenix Cardinals can be a massive headache -- this week, especially. 
</P>
<P>
By denying the New Orleans Saints a touchdown in the Louisiana Superdome today, 
the Cardinals can keep perhaps a few people in New Orleans celibate. 
</P>
<P>
After the Saints were held to four field goals in their opening-night loss to 
the San Francisco 49ers, radio personalities "Steve and D.C." of WMXZ-FM 
announced they would abstain from sex until the Saints scored a touchdown. They 
invited listeners to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Saints lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 32-3. Cold showers were 
recommended. Bruce Bond, program director for the station, said: "We've had 
zillions of calls. . . . Now, we're trying to get the whole town to do it, and 
we're trying to get the Saints' attention so they'll go out and score a 
touchdown and win a game." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Former Chicago Bear running back Walter Payton threw 34 passes and 
completed 11 for 331 yards. How many touchdown passes did he throw? 
</P>
<P>
Still in a trance: Heavyweight Jerry Quarry, 45, whose application for a 
license was turned down Friday by the California Athletic Commission, arrived 
at the Commission meeting Friday with Guy Ditmars, his trainer, and Sam 
Carraway, a hypnotist. 
</P>
<P>
Said Carraway, who has been working with Quarry for the last month: "He's not 
the same person he was when I first started working with him. Before, I think 
he felt it was a hopeless situation." 
</P>
<P>
Mark this: Followers of the Mark Spitz fantasy camp might have noticed 
Thursday's announcement of the qualifying times for the 1992 U.S. Olympic 
swimming trials. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the trials, Spitz will have to swim the 100-meter butterfly in 
55.59 seconds, only 1.35 seconds slower than the world record he set in the 
1972 Olympic Games in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz, who will be 40 in 1992, is training under UCLA Coach Ron Ballatore, but 
has yet to compete since his comeback began last year. 
</P>
<P>
Splendid span: On this day in 1957, Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox ended a 
streak in which he set a major league record by reaching base safely in 16 
at-bats. The streak included four home runs, two singles, nine walks and one 
hit-by-pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Easy come, easy go: Preparing for the inevitable, Lou Brock released an 
"official statement" Friday, telling how he feels now that Rickey Henderson is 
about to break his record for stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
An excerpt: "Just like Halley's comet, which has come and gone twice in the 
20th Century (1910 and 1986), stolen base No. 939 by Henderson in 1990 will 
also be the second time in the 20th Century that the all-time stolen base 
record has come and gone. In 1979 my stolen base No. 938 broke Billy Hamilton's 
1901 record of 937, which was the first time in the 20th Century that the 
all-time stolen base record had come and gone." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Eight.

1990 IS A COMEBACK SEASON IN THE MAKING FOR JOHN ELWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CLAYTON, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

KIRKLAND, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a few minutes Monday, the Denver Broncos and John Elway weren't on their 
usual perch a mile above the rest of the teams in the American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter sight of 260-pound Kansas City Chiefs fullback Christian 
Okoye barreling over 185-pound Broncos cornerback Tyrone Braxton brought out 
animal instincts from the Chiefs. They smelled blood from a wounded champion. 
Linebacker Chris Martin stepped onto the field and pointed his finger into the 
faces of Broncos. Taunts filled the September mountain air. The AFC kings were 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of you guys winning," is what Broncos receiver Mark Jackson said he 
overheard the Chiefs shouting at his teammates. When you win three AFC titles 
in four years and lose three Super Bowl games, you expect criticism. When 
you're John Elway, you expect worse. 
</P>
<P>
So there was Elway Monday night, facing fourth down and the season. The Chiefs 
led, 23-21, thanks to an improbable 83-yard touchdown by Stephone Paige, a 
possession receiver who would lose to a linebacker in a match race. It was 
fourth-and-10 at the Broncos' 17 with just more than one minute left. Elway had 
thrown 10 consecutive incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
One more errant toss and Elway's chances of returning to the Super Bowl this 
season were dim. The Broncos would have been 0-2 and no team has ever won the 
AFC West with such a bad start. The Chiefs were excited. Joe Montana is known 
as the Comeback Kid. Elway is known as the quarterback Super Bowl viewers hope 
will never come back. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the toughest thing for me is the fact that I've lost every one 
individually," Elway said. "When you talk about Denver's losses you talk about 
John Elway losing the Super Bowl. That is probably the most difficult thing." 
</P>
<P>
But the Super Bowl isn't until January, so watch out. Elway burned the Chiefs 
with a 49-yard fourth-down bullet to Vance Johnson, and a minute later, the 
Chiefs were 24-23 victims. He may not be Mr. January, but the guy is sure 
deadly during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the key is, 'What if we hadn't done it,"' Elway said. "If we lose that 
game, it would have turned our world upside down. We would be 0-2 and we lose a 
game on the homefield to the Chiefs." 
</P>
<P>
Elway's back. In some ways, he's better than ever. Monday night's fourth-down 
miracle illustrates why Elway keeps going to Super Bowls. At least twice a 
year, he turns sure losses into improbable victories. That two-game swing is 
the reason the Broncos finish 11-5 instead of 9-7 and, in two of three cases, 
it's the reason they secured homefield advantage for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
As AFC teams all know, the teams with the homefield advantage usually go the 
Super Bowl. That is unless you force Elway to drive 98 yards in Cleveland 
Stadium in the final minutes of an AFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
His big play Monday, The Throw, they're calling it in Denver, marked the 17th 
time in Elway's eight seasons he's brought the team from behind in the fourth 
quarter with his $2 million a year right arm. Blame the Super Bowl losses on 
Elway, if you wish. But the Broncos know he's their ticket to the game. 
</P>
<P>
It's funny how Elway's ability to come back has become so commonplace. Jackson, 
for example, rooted for Paige to go the entire 83 yards for the touchdown so 
that the Broncos could get the ball back with 1:44 and three timeouts left. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tackle) Gerald Perry had the quote of the day," Jackson said. "He said, 
'Let's just do it.' When your offensive linemen have that kind of confidence, 
that's good. Usually, they are worried about not getting beat by a defender." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, 1990 is a comeback year for Elway. Losing a third Super Bowl hit 
him hard. He sneaked away to a new home in Palm Springs during the off-season 
and got away from the Denver fans and press, who, he claimed, suffocated him 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching the age of 30 was another eye opener for Elway. Suddenly, a touch of 
football mortality reached him. Four years remain on his six-year, $12.7 
million contract, but before camp, Elway started dropping hints he isn't 
certain he'll finish the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, he must wait until January to try to erase the Super Bowl stigma 
tagged to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It still stings," Elway said. "It's a dark cloud that's hanging over us." 
</P>
<P>
Elway reported to camp slimmer and mentally fresher and had a great training 
camp. Then came the season-opener against the Los Angeles Raiders. He wilted 
from heat exhaustion in 100-plus degree heat as the Broncos suffered a 14-9 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how much he tried to hide it, Elway, who completed only 14-of-31 
passes, ached emotionally through the week that followed. 
</P>
<P>
"Beside the Super Bowl, that's probably the most disappointed I've been in a 
long time," he said. "I took a lot of criticism. I didn't play well, so I can't 
say I didn't deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet those thoughts didn't cross his mind on that fourth-and-10 against Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in a situation where you have nothing to win," Elway said. "A lot of 
guys think it's more pressure, but there really is not. To me there is far less 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Montana says plays seem to slow down during crucial situations. He should know. 
His 24 fourth-quarter come-from-behind victories with the San Francisco 49ers 
top even retired Dallas Cowboys Roger Staubach, who had 23 fourth-quarter 
come-from-behind victories, including 14 in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that things slow down, but they seem to be more clear," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that Elway's ability to spark a comeback with one-play puts 
him in the class with Staubach, Montana and Ken Stabler. 
</P>
<P>
"I think John and Roger are very similar," said Broncos Coach Dan Reeves, who 
played with Staubach and coaches Elway. "Both of them had that tremendous arm 
and the ability to scramble and make things happen. I think both teams have 
reacted to both quarterbacks the same way. They never really feel they are out 
of a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Except in Super Bowls, where their average loss is by 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
"One Super Bowl win will get rid of that," Elway said. "You just can't come to 
grips with, 'hey, if you lose the Super Bowl, you are not the second-best team 
in the league, you're the 28th-best team."' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
17 COMEBACKS FOR NO. 7

Rodney Culver's one-yard touchdown run with 34 seconds remaining lifted 
top-ranked Notre Dame to a 20-19 victory over No. 24 Michigan State, the second 
consecutive comeback victory for the Irish over a ranked team from Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there's a special thing about Notre Dame," Irish Coach Lou Holtz 
said. "I can't prove it. But I think it's a special place. I believe the school 
is blessed. 
</P>
<P>
"But to say we're lucky would be taking something away from Michigan State's 
football team." 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Watters' two-yard touchdown run put Notre Dame (2-0) within 19-14 with 
13:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish began the winning drive at their 19 with 5:15 remaining, taking 12 
plays to score. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Mirer, who completed 14 of 21 passes for 155 yards, set up the score with 
a 24-yard pass to Adrian Jarrell at the Michigan State two-yard line. Mirer's 
pass bounced off linebacker Todd Murray and into Jarrell's arms. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer said it was the same play the Irish used last week for a key completion 
on a deflected pass in a 28-24 victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it hit him in the chest," Mirer said. "I thought it was a poor decision 
on my part. I heard it hit him in the chest. It made a thud. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting ready to make the tackle." 
</P>
<P>
Culver scored three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two balls that were tipped the last two games very easily could have 
gone the other way," Mirer said. "There's definitely somebody looking out for 
us. There's somebody on our side." 
</P>
<P>
It marked the sixth time Notre Dame came into a game against Michigan State 
ranked No. 1. The only time the Irish didn't win was the famed 10-10 tie of 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is 60-9-3 in games in which it was ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no excuses, no alibis," Michigan State Coach George Perles said. "I 
told the team we aren't snake-bitten. You play the cards that are dealt and it 
works both ways." 
</P>
<P>
The 24th-ranked Spartans (0-1-1) stunned the Irish with 12 points in a 5:20 
span of of the second quarter to take a 12-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After John Langeloh kicked a 43-yard field goal, Murray blocked Craig 
Hentrich's punt out of the end zone for a safety, cutting the Notre Dame lead 
to 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans then drove 56 yards in seven plays, highlighted by Hyland 
Hickson's 32-yard carry to the Irish one-yard line. Three plays later he scored 
behind a block by Toby Heaton. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans went 88 yards in 12 plays on their only possession of the third 
quarter for a 19-7 lead on Tico Duckett's one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish answered with a 66-yard, 16-play drive that was capped by Watters' 
carry on the fourth snap of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on Watters' five-yard scoring 
run.

Wyoming quarterback Tom Corontzos completed 16 of 24 passes for 200 yards and 
connected on touchdown pass plays of 48 and 25 yards to lead the Cowboys to a 
24-12 victory over Air Force in a Western Athletic Conference game Saturday at 
Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming, 4-0 overall and 1-0 in the WAC, scored its final touchdown on a 
five-yard run by tailback Jay Daffer with less than two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force (2-2, 1-2) scored on a two-yard run by DeShawn Durham and a

</P>
<P>
Colorado State 38, Texas El Paso 20 -- Brian Copeland rushed for 142 yards and

</P>
<P>
Colorado State spotted UTEP a 13-0 lead three minutes into the game, then

</P>
<P>
Fullback Todd Yert scored twice, and tailbacks Copeland and Tony Alford also 
scored -- all on one-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii 19, Utah 7 -- Garrett Gabriel connected with Jeff Sydner on a 73-yard

VIRGINIA WINS, 59-0, BUT WELSH COMPLAINS

<P>
Virginia rolled up 543 yards of offense, forced seven turnovers and pranced to 
a 59-0 victory over Duke Saturday at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach George Welsh wasn't raving about his 10th-ranked Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't that sharp," an unsmiling Welsh said after Virginia scored its 
biggest Atlantic Coast Conference victory ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed blocks, we didn't pick up blitzes," Welsh said. "We're not that much 
better than Duke. They helped us a lot. They moved the ball, but they had too 
many turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia is 4-0 overall and 2-0 in ACC play. Duke is 1-2 and 0-1. The two teams 
tied for the ACC championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore ran one yard for a touchdown in the second 
quarter and hit Herman Moore on scoring pass plays of 36 and 40 yards. Moore, 
the wide receiver, now has 20 touchdown receptions in his career, which equals 
the school record set by John Ford. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Shawn Moore was finished midway through the third quarter, he had 
completed 11 of 17 passes for 181 yards. He is 19-2 as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Florida State 31, Tulane 13 -- Brad Johnson completed 13 of 17 passes for 
170 yards and one touchdown and ran for another score to lead the Seminoles 
(3-0) at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State led, 24-0, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's touchdown pass came on a six-play drive from the Florida State 13. He 
completed three straight passes for 35 yards, and on first down from the Tulane 
44 found Edgar Bennett alone in the right flat, and Bennett, breaking three 
tackles along the way, went the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane is 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 48, Appalachian State 0 -- Clemson got what it wanted. The 17th-ranked 
Tigers, whose offense had scored only two touchdowns in the past two weeks, 
scored often and quickly against the Division I-AA Mountaineers at Clemson, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals was to either score 40 points or have over 500 yards total 
offense," Coach Ken Hatfield said. "Another goal was to shut out Appalachian 
State. . . . We challenged our players on this." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (3-1) had 493 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman tailback Ronald Williams, playing in place of injured Rodney Blunt, 
ran for 183 yards and three touchdowns. Derrick Witherspoon, another freshman, 
gained 123 yards and scored on an 81-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland 13, North Carolina State 12 -- Dan DeArmas kicked a 25-yard field goal 
with 11 seconds left to give the Terrapins an ACC victory at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
An interception by Fernandus Vinson -- the Wolfpack's fourth of the game -- 
gave N.C. State the ball with a 12-10 lead and only 1:27 left. But the 
Wolfpack's Greg Manior fumbled and the Terrapins recovered at midfield and 
drove to the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland is 3-1 and 1-1; N.C. State 2-2 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina 35, Virginia Tech 24 -- Running back Mike Dingle scored four 
touchdowns, two in the fourth quarter, and the Gamecocks came from behind to 
defeat the Hokies in a nonconference game at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bobby Fuller completed 15 of 25 passes for 251 yards and two 
touchdowns for South Carolina (3-0). Dingle had 137 yards in 33 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech (2-2) had the ball and led, 24-13, with less than eight minutes 
to play, but Fuller brought the Gamecocks back with an eight-yard touchdown 
pass to Dingle, a two-point conversion pass to Robert Brooks and, after a 
Virginia Tech fumble, a 26-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Miller to give South 
Carolina the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 44, Tennessee Chattanooga 9 -- Sophomore quarterback Shawn Jones 
ran for a touchdown, threw for another and set up two field goals with his 
passing to lead the Yellow Jackets over the Division I-AA Moccasins at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech (2-0), with Jones completing 15 of 23 passes for a career-high 265 
yards, has won eight consecutive games at home. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State 37, Central Florida 28 -- Keith Benton threw for 197 yards and 
two touchdowns in leading the Tigers (1-1-1) over the Division I-AA Knights 
(2-2).

KASAY'S FIELD GOAL KEEPS ALABAMA WINLESS, 17-16

John Kasay's 40-yard field goal with 1:31 remaining lifted Georgia to a 17-16 
victory over Alabama on Saturday, extending the Crimson Tide's longest losing 
streak in 34 years to five games. 
</P>
<P>
Kasay's third field goal of the game capped a fourth-quarter rally from a 16-6 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia drove 71 yards to cut the lead to 16-14 on Larry Ware's three-yard 
touchdown run with 5:53 left. 
</P>
<P>
Ware threw a halfback pass to Chris Broom for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
When Alabama failed to move after the kickoff, Georgia took over at the Alabama 
45 with 4:10 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison Hearst had a 17-yard run in the drive that bogged down on the 23, and 
Kasay came in to kick the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (2-1) squared its Southeastern Conference record at 1-1. Alabama fell 
to 0-3 overall and 0-2 in the SEC, and is in the cellar of a league it has 
dominated. 
</P>
<P>
The loss left Gene Stallings still looking for his first victory as the Crimson 
Tide coach, a position he took in January when Bill Curry left for Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama's last five-game losing streak came when the 1956 team lost its first 
four to give the Tide 17 losses in succession over three seasons.

<P>
Louisiana State's celebration didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it appeared a Hail Mary pass had given the Tigers a victory over 
Vanderbilt Saturday in a Southeastern Conference game at Nashville, Tenn., it 
was ruled that Todd Kinchen, who caught the pass, pushed cornerback Derek 
Wilham. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive pass-interference call enabled the Commodores to pull off a 24-21 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Wilson, a sophomore quarterback making his first start, scored on a 
four-yard run with 1:09 left, giving Vanderbilt the lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Chad Loup brought the Tigers right back, moving LSU from its own eight to 
the Commodore 42. On fourth and 10 from the 42, the freshman lofted the ball 
into the air, and Kinchen came down with it between a pair of Vanderbilt 
defenders in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But the apparent touchdown was wiped out by the pass-interference call, and 
Vanderbilt took over with three second left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory allowed Vanderbilt, 1-1 overall and 0-1 in the SEC, to snap a 
10-game losing streak. LSU is now 2-1 and 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson rushed for 136 yards in 29 carries as he turned in a near flawless 
performance in guiding the Vanderbilt wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson gave way to backup Mike Healey after LSU had grabbed a 21-17 lead on a 
16-yard run by Odell Beckham with 3:34 left. Healey took the Commodores from 
their own 21-yard line to the LSU four. 
</P>
<P>
Then Wilson returned and, on the first play, faked to Carlos Thomas off right 
tackle and followed his fullback into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
No. 19 Florida 27, Furman 3 -- The Gators methodically pulled away from the 
nation's top-ranked Division I-AA team at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Errict Rhett rushed for 98 yards in his first college start and Shane Matthews 
passed for 238 yards and three touchdowns to pace Florida (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
Furman, a perennial I-AA power that plays one game a year against a major 
college opponent, fell to 3-1. The Paladins averaged 41 points per game in 
their first three games but were limited to a first-quarter field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Although the score was lopsided, Florida's performance was sloppy. The Gators, 
with superior size, wore down the Paladins despite throwing two interceptions 
and losing two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State 13, Southern Mississippi 10 -- History repeated itself as 
Joel Logan kicked a 41-yard field goal with 3:01 left to give the Bulldogs 
(2-1) of the SEC a nonconference victory over the Eagles (2-2), an independent, 
at Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Logan's field goal with four seconds left gave Mississippi State a 
26-23 victory over Southern Mississippi, which still leads this series 14-12-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles got a chance to win Saturday night, but Jim Taylor's 47-yard 
field-goal attempt with 1:15 left was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 16, Kentucky 13 -- Clint Gwaltney kicked three field goals -- 
the last a career-best 50-yarder with 4:31 left -- and the Tar Heels (3-1) of 
the Atlantic Coast Conference won a nonconference game against the SEC Wildcats 
(1-3) at Chapel Hill, N.C.

STEINBRENNER IS NOT CONTENT ON SIDELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT MILTON, ASSOCIATED PRESS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first month of the rest of his life without baseball bossdom, a wounded 
George Steinbrenner misses the clubhouse and the "player talk" and is bitter 
about the commissioner who took it all away from him. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was not cut out by this, no way," Steinbrenner said in an interview 
with The Associated Press last week in Tampa and aboard his private jet to New 
York. "No man, and certainly not Fay Vincent, is ever going to be able to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Steinbrenner still bristles over Vincent's announcement that the 
New York Yankees owner had accepted a lifetime ban from day-to-day management 
of the team. He says he did nothing to justify even a suspension and 
volunteered to step aside only because Vincent was going to suspend him for two 
years regardless. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no ban, no suspension, no probation," Steinbrenner insists. And 
while he accepts the consequences, he adds, "I'm not happy with the way the 
agreement is turning out." 
</P>
<P>
However it came about, the bottom line is that Friday marks one month since 
Steinbrenner resigned as managing partner of the Yankees after baseball's 
investigation into his association with a Bronx gambler. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Steinbrenner, who usually plays his personal feelings close to 
the vest, said he has been hurt by the whole experience and is embarrassed, 
particularly when people approach him and forlornly ask how he's holding up. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not kicked out of baseball," Steinbrenner states emphatically. He notes 
that his family still owns controlling interest in the team and expects 
21-year-old son Hal, a senior at Williams College, to follow in his father's 
footsteps and run the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I stepped down from the day-to-day operation of the team under an agreement 
with the baseball commissioner," Steinbrenner said. "It was not a punishment; 
it was an agreement, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent ruled on July 30 that Steinbrenner had violated the rules of baseball 
in conducting his own investigation of Dave Winfield, now with the California 
Angels, and in paying $40,000 to gambler Howard Spira, a former employee of 
Winfield's charitable foundation, to get dirt on the outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner said he signed the agreement to resign by Aug. 20 because the 
suspension Vincent was about to slap on him, while "totally unwarranted, 
totally," might have cost him his vice presidency with the U.S. Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Outside of my family," he said, "my involvement in the U.S. Olympics has meant 
more to me than anything else. I didn't want to jeopardize that. 
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics thrills me. It makes me proud of America and proud of our young 
people. That doesn't mean I'm not proud of our athletes that play major league 
baseball, but they have strong agents and an effective union to take care of 
them. Our Olympians don't." 
</P>
<P>
The USOC didn't ask him to resign, but he was placed on inactive status. 
</P>
<P>
That says a lot about Steinbrenner's last month. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a month when his beloved Yankees, who already were having their 
losingest season since 1912, have been even worse (50-70 before he left, 10-18 
since) and he hasn't been able to anything about it, least of all fire or trade 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a month of watching games on television and perusing the boxscores 
but never stepping foot in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, wearing a World Series championship ring and impeccably dressed 
in beige slacks and a pink monogrammed shirt, appeared rested and relaxed as he 
sat on a sofa in a suite of his hotel overlooking Tampa Bay, not far from the 
offices of his American Shipbuilding Company. 
</P>
<P>
He's been spending a lot of time at his 760-acre Kinsman horse farm in Ocala, 
Fla., with his son, Hank, who runs the family's thoroughbred interests. 
</P>
<P>
He says he doesn't miss the spotlight, but does miss being around the 
excitement of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to be back up at the stadium," he said. "I miss my players, and the 
player-talk." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Steinbrenner can attend Yankee home games but can't sit in 
the owner's box or the press box. He hasn't gone to a game since his 
resignation and doesn't plan to the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He has returned to New York on other business and said he has been uplifted by 
the warm response from some of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls one trip two weeks ago, while walking down Manhattan's posh Park 
Avenue late at night, a patrol car pulled over and began trolling alongside the 
curb for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner said he asked the officers what they wanted, and they replied: "We 
just want to make sure you get home OK, Mr. Steinbrenner." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody says, 'Get ... out of New York, you no good bum,' but you'd think that 
to read the New York papers," Steinbrenner said. "Sure, there are some fans at 
the stadium that reporters interview who attack me. But they interview three 
guys wearing T-shirts that say 'Kill George.' What do you think they are going 
to say about me?" 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner prides himself on being tough, but he admits to being offended the 
night the fans stood at Yankee Stadium and applauded when they learned he was 
out as managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, nobody likes getting booed or being torn apart in the New York tabloids, 
but I can handle it," he said. "I'm mentally tough. You have to be if you are 
going to be anything in sports. I look at it as a moment of great testing." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner found solace during the most turbulent days of his life in the 
movie "Hoosiers" about a small Midwestern town high school basketball that 
overcame insurmountable odds to win the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
He has watched it more than 40 times, often as he shuttled between Tampa, New 
York and Cleveland in the midst of the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner closely identifies with the coach, played by Gene Hackman, who 
triumphs despite opposition from parents and school officials who want him 
fired because of his unorthodoxed methods. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is a guy who had his own way of doing things," Steinbrenner said. "The 
guy stuck to his beliefs despite all the criticism and the team ends up 
winning. It's my favorite. It makes me feel real good inside." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner certainly had his own way of doing things with the Yankees, and 
now that he has had a chance to step back and reflect, he acknowledges some bad 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's plenty of dents in my armour," he said. "I've made a lot of mistakes. 
Maybe there were too many managerial changes." 
</P>
<P>
He can't resist justifying them, though, pointing out that five of the 19 
changes in 17 years involved the same man -- Billy Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the guy," Steinbrenner said. "Billy Martin was one of the dearest 
friends I ever had, and one of the greatest managers I've ever seen in the 
game. ... He had a drinking problem and would self-destruct." 
</P>
<P>
Some might argue that Steinbrenner self-destructed, too, that the feud with 
Winfield that was his undoing was part of the constant chaos created by none 
other than Steinbrenner, "The Boss" or "Patton in Pinstripes." 
</P>
<P>
"When you win, you're a hero, when you lose, you're a bum," he said, pointing 
out that HIS Yankees won two World Series, four American League pennants and 
five divisional championships, even if none were after 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He declares that he will never sell the franchise which he purchased in 1973 
along with 10 limited partners for $10 million and which now is valued at 
better than 20 times that much. 
</P>
<P>
And as he soars toward New York in his eight-passenger jet, always stocked with 
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and his favorite movie videos, he can't help 
but raise the idea: 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'll look for another team to buy -- a football or basketball team," he 
suggests with an angelic grin, "that's if an owner would have me."

TAGLIABUE IS WARY OF TV SATURATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a few months after the National Football League signed contracts with five 
television networks that will pay more than $3 billion over the next four 
seasons, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Tuesday the NFL is closely monitoring 
any indicators that may suggest oversaturation. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging interview with editors and reporters of The Washington Post, 
Tagliabue spoke in detail on the possibility of Dexter Manley returning to the 
NFL after one year of his drug-related suspension; on his desire for the 
Washington Redskins' new stadium to be located in the District of Columbia; 
random testing for steroids and the support it has among players, and the 
imminent implementation of a practice squad and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
It is now possible to watch NFL programming Sunday's from noon until midnight, 
with games also scheduled on Mondays and, later in the season, Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems is that we have so much on television now," Tagliabue 
said. "In the early '60s there was no NFL game on television at all if the home 
team was playing at home. That was until 1964 or 1965. Now we have three or 
maybe four (in every city except sometimes Los Angeles and New York). And the 
cable game on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned -- maybe concerned is a bit too strong -- but we are 
looking very closely at the amount of television we have. I think baseball 
(which now has more than 200 games on TV) is going to have to take a look at 
where they are, frankly. You've seen the numbers on ESPN and how much money 
they're going to lose on baseball. You've seen the ratings; they're 40 percent 
below what (ESPN) projected and the revenue is 40 to 50 percent below what they 
projected." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL signed contracts last winter and spring with CBS, NBC, ABC, ESPN and 
TNT to televise all 224 regular season games plus the playoffs. Those networks, 
in turn, will play the league more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not reassessing, because we think what we set up will work," he said. 
"But we're looking at it closely and monitoring it on a monthly basis. ... So 
far the public has made it clear they're interested in NFL telecasts in a way 
that has no parallel in sports and few parallels in television. But that 
doesn't mean it's going to be that way forever." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he could foresee a time when the networks have to cut back on the 
amount of NFL programming, Tagliabue said: "That may have to happen at some 
point. At some point there will be over saturation and it will not be sensible 
from the fans' standpoint or the league's standpoint to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
One of Tagliabue's more immediate concerns is what to do with Manley, the 
banned Redskins defensive end, assuming he applies for reinstatement in 
October. If Manley demonstrates he has been drug-free since his suspension in 
November, Tagliabue could lift what is called a lifetime ban. Manley has been 
at a rehabilitation facility run by former NBA star John Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to talk to Bob Woolf (Manley's attorney) in October and ask him him 
'what has he been doing? Give me an up-to-date status report in terms of his 
participation in the Lucas program in Houston,' " Tagliabue said. "The other 
thing we need to look at together is his contract status. It's complicated. 
What I hope to do is get on top of it in October and be prepared to deal with 
it without a lot of delay. I have reinstated a couple of players this year; 
Tony Collins (recently cut by the Dolphins) is one. In each case, where I had 
an application for reinstatement, I had medical evaluations, I had my own 
examination as to what they were doing in terms of employment, in terms of what 
they were doing in rehabilitation and treatment. And I also tried to focus on 
what effect coming back into the National Football League would have. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough area. I'm clear that some of these players will do pretty well 
outside the pressures of participating in the NFL, but when you subject them 
again to those pressures they have problems. It's a real dilemma. ... I think 
my policy is going to have to be if a player establishes a record he's going to 
have to come back in and we'll have to worry later about making sure he has the 
support and can survive the pressure-cooker environment. I don't yet have a 
scientific basis for letting them back in. To this point I think I've leaned 
over backward to let them back in, recognizing that it's a big penalty if I 
don't let them back in." 
</P>
<P>
In other matters, Tagliabue said NFL management representatives and the NFL 
Players Association has agreed to re-establish a practice squad of three to 
five players for the rest of the season. Players would be unrestricted free 
agents if another team wanted to sign them onto an active roster, and salaries 
would vary. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of entering a third season without a collective bargaining 
agreement between players and management, Tagliabue said he knows there is some 
sentiment around the league that an agreement is not necessary because the 
league is thriving. "I don't agree with that," he said, "because I feel we 
could be more productive if we could work together in more areas." Courts can 
tell you what you did wrong in the past, but for the most part they don't give 
you much of a prescription for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue says it would make more sense to work out a contract now because of 
the $3 billion from television. "In 1987 there was no opportunity to do 
anything new or creative if there was a dollar sign attached to it. Now we have 
that opportunity." The commissioner said he has been having only 
"off-the-record" talks with the two sides and that things are moving "slowly." 
</P>
<P>
On the topic of the Raiders not moving to Oakland, he said: "I think everybody 
has regrets about the way the city was dealt with by the team. ... I always 
said it was the best-supported franchise in the league at the time and it was 
by almost any measure. They came to us late and they had a lot of problems 
getting their own community together. I think there are a lot of people in the 
league who still feel that Oakland is very, very deserving of a team." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said one school of thought in the league is that Oakland, Baltimore 
and St. Louis, all of which have lost teams in the 1980s, are deserving of a 
second chance. Another group prefers the "fresh-market" approach of the 
Carolinas, Memphis, Jacksonville, Fla., to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
"There is concern," he said, "that the net effect of a team move is negative in 
terms of fan interest. The cumulative effect has a lot of people concerned that 
you lose the tradition, you lose the continuity, you lose the commitment in the 
community and all that is very fragile." 
</P>
<P>
On the league's drug-testing programs, he said, "the big problem we have on the 
street drugs is we only test once a year (as dictated by an arbiter's decision) 
and as a result we really don't know about problems until they surface with law 
enforcement authorities. On steroids we're testing virtually every week on a 
random basis, and I think that will be a tremendous deterrent to the use of 
steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and others have talked to me about, in 
effect, ignoring the arbitrator's decision and going ahead and testing four, 
five or six times a year or on a random basis for street drugs. I've decided I 
would revamp the steroid program first -- the players are extremely supportive 
of the steroid testing -- so I decided I would revamp it there, go to random 
testing there, develop credibility, develop trust and then see where we go as a 
next step on the street drugs."

ALLEN ENJOYS A DAY AT THE BEACH WITH 49ERS, 28-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was hard to tell if it was a smile or a grin of disbelief that George Allen 
wore as he walked off the field Saturday afternoon. It seemed, he said, as if 
it had taken 40 years, but he had finally won a football game again. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bigger than an NFL victory because these kids have been down for so 
long," Allen, 72, said after Cal State Long Beach defeated Pacific, 28-7, 
before 5,366 in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was actually 34 years ago when Allen, then at Whittier, last coached a 
college team to victory. The former NFL coach, who has spent nine months at his 
new job of trying to rebuild Long Beach football, said he was amazed that the 
49ers ended their three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
'I've got to pinch myself to be sure," Allen said. "I'm still numb." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (1-3 overall, 1-1 in the Big West) took its first lead of the season 
in the first quarter on a 32-yard pass play from Todd Studer to Jeff Exum. 
</P>
<P>
Studer, a junior college transfer, completed 18 of 29 passes for 296 yards and 
three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receivers Mark Seay and Gerald Woodyard, who scored two touchdowns, 
combined for nine catches. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers shut down the run-and-shoot offense of Pacific (1-3, 0-2) almost 
completely in the first half. Then they stopped the Tigers twice early in the 
third quarter when Pacific threatened to tie the score, once on a goal-line 
interception by Shawn Wilbourn. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense held up the whole game," Allen said. "I used three linemen, two 
linebackers and six defensive backs. I call it a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific scored late in the third quarter to cut the lead to 14-7 on a 30-yard 
pass play from Troy Kopp to Aaron Turner, but Studer came back with scoring 
pass plays of seven and 60 yards to Woodyard in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Declining the game ball, Allen gave it to Seay, who lost a kidney in a shooting 
two years ago and missed last season. 
</P>
<P>
"He inspired me," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
As the 49ers left their locker room, tight end Bryon Hamilton, who caught four 
passes for 73 yards, got his coach's autograph on the game program to 
commemorate the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
That was a new experience for Allen, as was getting doused with ice water on 
the sidelines as the clock ran out.

<P>
FULLERTON: SCHULTE PASSES FOR 183 YARDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER BUT ENDS UP WITH 
FIVE INTERCEPTIONS IN A 48-17 LOSS AT AKRON.

<P>
Cal State Fullerton was heading north for Cleveland Saturday until someone 
informed the bus driver that the Titans were playing at Akron, which was to the 
south of the team's hotel in Fairlawn, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's game against the Zips in the Rubber Bowl wound up turning as 
abruptly as the Wrong-Way Titans did earlier on Interstate 77. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 10-point first-quarter lead but collapsed amid a flurry of 
turnovers and mistakes and lost, 48-17, before 10,241. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (1-3) looked like world-beaters in the first quarter but did a good 
job of beating themselves in the next three. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Paul Schulte, who threw for 183 yards in the first quarter and 
appeared headed for a school passing record, set a record all right -- for 
interceptions in a game. He was picked off five times, tying Bob Caffrey's mark 
set against Utah State in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton also lost two of its three fumbles, had a punt blocked deep in its 
own territory, missed several tackles and dropped several passes, one a 
potential touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan defense, which held Auburn and Mississippi State under 200 yards 
rushing, couldn't contain Akron's option offense, which featured the running of 
quarterback Jeff Sweitzer (111 yards and two touchdowns) and tailbacks Doug 
Lewis (63 yards, two touchdowns) and Marcus Reliford (86 yards). 
</P>
<P>
"We met the enemy and the enemy was us," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We dropped passes, lost fumbles, threw interceptions. After the first quarter, 
we should have got on the bus and got out of there." 
</P>
<P>
The game turned during a four-minute span early in the second quarter. First 
Fullerton kicker Phil Nevin's 32-yard field goal attempt that would have 
extended the lead to 13-0 was ruled no good, a call the Titans disputed and 
even the Zips wondered about. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it went right through the uprights," said Akron center Mike 
O'Connor, who is from Mater Dei High in Santa Ana. "I couldn't believe the 
call. We got a break there." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Daron Alcorn's 37-yard field goal cut the deficit to 10-3 with 
13:22 left in the half, J.J. Celestine fumbled on the ensuing kickoff return 
and Chris Owens recovered for the Zips (3-0-1) at the Titan 16-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
It took Akron one play to make the score 10-10, as Lewis took a pitch and raced 
around left end for a touchdown and Alcorn added the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Akron forced Fullerton to punt on its next possession, but Nevin's attempt was 
blocked by Kenneth Greene and recovered by Shawn Donaldson at the Titan 10. Two 
plays later, Lewis scored on a two-yard run for a 17-10 lead with 10:48 left in 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte, who completed seven of 12 passes and ran a successful no-huddle 
offense in the first quarter, completed one of 12 passes in the second and 
third quarters before being pulled in favor of Terry Payne early in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Zip cornerback Shawn Vincent had three of the five interceptions as Akron 
increased its season total to 15. Akron used five defensive backs and played 
mostly zone, but disguised its defense by covering Titan receivers close to the 
line of scrimmage -- giving the look of man-to-man coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no major changes in the second quarter, we just started picking up 
their offense," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out flat in the first quarter and weren't ready for the hurry-up 
offense. After they drove on us a few times, our coach (Gerry Faust) got on us 
on the sideline, screaming and yelling at us, and we started playing ball."

Cal State Fullerton was heading north for Cleveland Saturday until someone 
informed the bus driver that the Titans were playing at Akron. 
</P>
<P>
How foretelling: Fullerton's game against the Zips turned just as abruptly as 
the Wrong-Way Titans did on Interstate 77. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 10-point lead in the first quarter but collapsed amid a flurry 
of turnovers and mistakes and lost, 48-17, in front of 10,241 at the Rubber 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (1-3) looked like world-beaters in the first quarter but did a good 
job of beating themselves during the next two, in which they were outscored, 
48-7. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Paul Schulte, who threw for 183 yards in the first quarter and 
appeared headed for a school passing record, set a record all right -- for 
interceptions in a game. He was picked off five times, tying Bob Caffrey's mark 
of five against Utah State in 1981.

<P>
Fullerton also lost two of its three fumbles, had a punt blocked deep in its 
own territory, missed several tackles and dropped several passes, one for a 
potential touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan defense, which held Auburn and Mississippi State to less than 200 
yards rushing each, couldn't contain Akron's option offense, which featured the 
running of quarterback Jeff Sweitzer (111 yards and two touchdowns) and 
tailbacks Doug Lewis (63 yards, two touchdowns) and Marcus Reliford (86 yards). 
The Zips had 285 yards rushing and 443 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We met the enemy and the enemy was us," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "We 
dropped passes, lost fumbles, threw interceptions . . . After the first 
quarter, we should have got on the bus and got out of there." 
</P>
<P>
The game turned during a four-minute span early in the second quarter. First, 
Fullerton kicker Phil Nevin's 32-yard field goal attempt that would have 
extended the lead to 13-0 was ruled no good, a call the Titans disputed and the

"I thought it went right through the uprights," said Akron center Mike

and Chris Owens recovered for the Zips (3-0-1) at the Titan 16-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
It took Akron one play to tie the score at 10, as Lewis took a pitch and raced 
around left end for a touchdown and Alcorn added the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Akron forced Fullerton to punt on its next possession, but Nevin's attempt was 
blocked by Kenneth Greene and recovered by Shawn Donaldson at the Titan 10. Two 
plays later, Lewis scored on a two-yard run for a 17-10 lead with 10:48 left in 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Fullerton's game went just like the All-American Soap Box Derby 
course located behind the Rubber Bowl -- all downhill. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte, who completed seven of 12 attempts and ran a successful no-huddle 
offense in the first quarter, completed one of 12 passes in the second and 
third quarters before being pulled in favor of Terry Payne early in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Zips cornerback Shawn Vincent had three of the five interceptions, helping 
Akron increase its season total to 15 in four games. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no major changes in the second quarter, we just started picking up 
their offense," Vincent said. "After they drove on us a few times, our coach 
(Gerry Faust) got on us on the sideline, screaming and yelling at us, and we 
started playing ball." 
</P>
<P>
And having a ball too. The Zips began picking up chunks of yardage on option 
runs, many of them by Sweitzer. Sweitzer also evaded several Fullerton blitzes, 
turning one scramble into a 30-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching Fullerton on film, I was more scared of them than any other team 
we've faced," Sweitzer said. "I was surprised at how much running room we had." 
</P>
<P>
The running game also opened up the passing game for Sweitzer, who completed 
four of 13 attempts for 47 yards in the first half but improved to five of six 
for 94 yards and two touchdowns in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"We were down at the beginning of the game, but we showed what we're made of 
and came out and blew them away," Sweitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy isn't sure what the Titans are made of. Fullerton played well in losses 
to Auburn and Mississippi State, teams the Titans weren't supposed to beat, 
then they're blown out by a team they were expected to be competitive with. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy believed the Akron game would give him an indication of how Fullerton 
would do in Big West Conference play, which begins next week at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take this game from the second quarter on, it doesn't look to good for 
us," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
What should have been a 15-minute ride to the Rubber Bowl became a 75-minute 
trip because the bus driver thought the Titans were playing at Cleveland's 
Municipal Stadium. About 20 minutes into the trip, Titan associate athletic 
director Walt Bowman, realizing they were going the wrong way, ordered the 
driver to stop the bus. But the driver didn't know how to get to the Rubber 
Bowl. "Three gas stations later, we finally made it," Bowman said. . . . Some 
Fullerton highlights: Schulte's 48-yard pass to Richard Harrison in the first 
quarter, his 63-yard pass to Greg West, who made a leaping catch between two 
Akron defenders in the first quarter, and Reggie Yarbrough's 63-yard touchdown 
run in the third. . . . Zips cornerback Shawn Vincent got a hand on Phil 
Nevin's 32-yard field goal attempt, but the ball caromed off the right upright 
and through the goal post in the first quarter. . . . Akron linebacker John 
Clark, who is on the watch list for the Dick Butkus Award, and fellow 
linebacker Brian Hilk each made 18 tackles. . . . Titan offensive tackle Mike 
Simmons didn't play because of an ankle injury.

BRETT'S PERFECT DAY LIFTS ROYALS PAST ANGELS, 4-3;

BASEBALL: HE GOES FOUR FOR FOUR, HITS WINNING HOME RUN AND INCREASES HIS

<TEXT>
<P>
George Brett, who is trying to become the first player to win batting titles in 
three decades, says he is as surprised by his chances as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting the season I had no intention of winning the batting championship, 
but I thought we'd be in contention," Brett said. "It turns out we aren't in 
contention, and I may win the batting championship." 
</P>
<P>
Brett went four for four as the Kansas City Royals beat the Angels, 4-3, 
Saturday. The decisive hit was Brett's tiebreaking home run in the seventh 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll do it. He's going to win the thing," Royal Manager John Wathan said. 
"There's no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
Brett, 37, won batting titles in 1976 and 1980. He increased his average to 
.332, 9 points ahead of the Texas Rangers' Rafael Palmeiro and 10 points ahead 
of the Oakland Athletics' Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Brett said he feels vastly different than in 1980, when he was trying to finish 
with a .400 average and ended up at .390. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not putting any pressure on myself," he said. "I don't feel like I have to 
do well. Maybe that's why I got four hits." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader doesn't normally talk about players on other teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But in George's case I'll make an exception," Rader said. "There's more to him 
than just as a player. The way he projects himself, the way he handles himself 
on the field. The way he competes. He's something special. I admire him very 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Brett's home run against Jim Abbott (10-14) was his sixth consecutive hit. It 
also was the 280th home run of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis (2-7) pitched 1 1/3 innings of perfect relief for his first victory 
since May 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 2-0 lead in the first against Hector Wagner on singles by 
Luis Polonia and Johnny Ray, second baseman Frank White's error, Dave 
Winfield's run-scoring single and a double-play grounder by Lee Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Brett's single in the first inning scored Kevin Seitzer, but Winfield's 20th 
home run made the score 3-1 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals' Gary Thurman scored when third baseman Donnie Hill committed an 
error on Bo Jackson's grounder in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City tied the score in the sixth when Mike Macfarlane scored on Brian 
McRae's single.

RED SOX LOSE, GET BAD NEWS ON CLEMENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Boston Red Sox's pennant hopes were dealt a severe blow Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They lost, 5-2, to the Yankees at New York in a game delayed at the start for 
more than five hours because of rain. But, perhaps more important, they learned 
that Roger Clemens (20-6) is still not ready to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, out since Sept. 4 with tendinitis in his right shoulder, had been 
scheduled to return today in the series finale at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But the Red Sox said Clemens' shoulder was still too tender and that it was 
uncertain whether he would pitch again this season. 
</P>
<P>
When New York's Steve Sax tripled in two runs in the eighth inning to break a 
2-2 tie, it kept the Red Sox tied with Toronto for first place in the American 
League East. Since Clemens went out, the Red Sox are 6-11. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox had thought Clemens could make three more starts in the 10 games 
left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
When Manager Joe Morgan made the announcement about Clemens not starting, he 
said Clemens agreed with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"He believes we're doing the right thing, as much as he wants to go out there," 
Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox bullpen failed to make the save for Mike Boddicker, who held the 
Yankees to four hits and a run and left after six innings with a 2-1 lead. The 
muddy mound appeared to bother Boddicker, who walked five and made two wild 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, who had lost seven in a row, tied it in the seventh inning when 
relief pitcher Larry Andersen threw away a potential double play ball. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gray (2-4) was on the mound when the Yankees broke it open in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The players were at Yankee Stadium for more than 11 hours. The game lasted more 
than 3 1/2 hours. Many of the announced crowd of 37,795 were gone before it 
started and hardly anyone was left when it ended. 
</P>
<P>
"This was too long," Sax said. "We watched some football, played cards, slept 
and ate. At least it turned out well. I've been here a long time and I'm ready 
to get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Toronto 2 -- The Blue Jays, who wind up their home schedule today, 
missed an opportunity to regain the top spot in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Maldonado and Chris James hit consecutive home runs in the sixth inning 
to give the Indians their second victory in a row over the Blue Jays and sixth 
in a row overall. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Kelly Gruber, who hit his 29th home run, said people who think 
the Blue Jays will fold are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"We came from 6 1/2 behind, and people say we're choking," he said. "I'm not 
concerned. We'll win some more." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays had 12 hits in 6 2/3 innings off Jeff Shaw (3-4) but left eight 
baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Detroit 1 -- Scott Sanderson won his career-high 17th victory and 
Rickey Henderson hit his 27th home run to move the Athletics closer to their 
third consecutive title in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Although he stole a base and trails the all-time leader, Lou Brock, by only 
five steals, 938-933, Henderson lost ground in his bid for the batting title. 
</P>
<P>
George Brett of Kansas City was four for four and shot up to .332, in his bid 
for his third batting title. Henderson, one for four, is 10 points behind with 
only 11 games left. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson (17-10) gave up three hits and an unearned run in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, Texas 0 -- Allan Anderson and two relief pitchers combined on a 
three-hitter at Minneapolis as the Twins rallied to win. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson gave up two hits in five innings, but reliever Larry Casian (1-1), who 
gave up the other hit, was the winner in relief. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Palmeiro had one of the Ranger hits and is hitting .323, nine points 
behind Brett. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 3, Milwaukee 2 -- Mike Devereaux hit a three-run home run at 
Baltimore and the Orioles handed the Brewers their fifth defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson (12-8), in his third start since coming off the disabled list, 
went six-plus innings to get his first win since Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 14, Seattle 5 -- The White Sox kept Oakland's magic number for 
clinching the Western Division to two as Carlton Fisk drove in four runs -- 
including a homer -- in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago had a season-high 18 hits as Robin Ventura, Frank Thomas, Lance Johnson 
and Ozzie Guillen had three each. Guillen added three RBIs. DAN HAFNER

Tony Tanti scored a goal and set up another Saturday night as the Pittsburgh 
Penguins improved their exhibition record to 5-1 with a 4-1 victory over the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins, one of the NHL's weakest defensive teams last season, held the 
Kings without a shot on goal in the third period and limited them to 15 shots 
for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh had 18 shots, 10 in the first period, in its second exhibition 
victory over the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins again played without Mario Lemieux, who is recovering from surgery 
on a herniated disk. NHL scoring leader Wayne Gretzky played a regular shift 
for the Kings and was held scoreless. He had two shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
Tanti put Pittsburgh ahead to stay at 18:02 of the first period with a 20-foot 
wrist shot through goalie Daniel Berthiaume's legs. 
</P>
<P>
John Cullen and rookie defenseman Paul Stanton scored to give the Penguins a 
3-0 lead in the second period. Cullen put in a centering pass from Rob Brown 
while Stanton converted a give-and-go with Barry Pederson with the teams 
playing a man short. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Francois Breault got the Kings' only goal at 18:27 of the second period, 
deflecting in Steve Graves' centering pass from the left-wing boards. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Robb Stauber, winger Darryl Williams and Brandy Semchuck were assigned 
by the Kings to New Haven of the American Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Winger Sean Whyte was assigned to Phoenix of the International Hockey League.

KEGGI'S 68 GIVES HER LEAD AT BUENA PARK; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: LOPEZ, BRILES FALTER IN THIRD ROUND. LEADER HAS NEVER WON AN LPGA 
TOURNAMENT.

<P>
If she was nervous Saturday, there was no indication from Caroline Keggi. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with Nancy Lopez and Jill Briles, with whom she shared the lead going 
into the third round of the LPGA tournament at Los Coyotes Country Club, Keggi 
made birdies while her playing partners made enough bogeys to drop from 
contention and put her alone in front going into the today's final round at 
Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would be playing with Nancy and all of Los Angeles would be with us, 
but I like playing with the veterans because I can learn something from them," 
Keggi said after shooting a 68 for a 54-hole total of 207, nine under par. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous out there. I told Jill after the first nine holes that I 
couldn't believe I was still nervous." 
</P>
<P>
And her plans for Saturday night? A good night's sleep? Practice? Biting nails? 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm going to go to the movies. I want to see 'Postcards From The 
Edge,' " Keggi said. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Gerring, who began the day at three under par, two strokes off the lead, 
had four birdies and no bogeys for a 68 to move into second at 209. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Caroline handled the big crowd well out there today, because it's 
tough sometimes playing with all the attention that Nancy brings," said 
Gerring, who doesn't have to worry about playing with Lopez today. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez faltered, shooting 74 for a 213 total. Briles' day was worse. She shot a 
77 for a 216. 
</P>
<P>
Gerring played Saturday's round with another Nancy -- Nancy Brown -- with whom 
she was tied at the start of the day. Brown took off fast, making three 
consecutive birdies and adding another on the fifth hole to tie Keggi at seven 
under par. But a double-bogey on the 12th hole and two more on the final two 
holes dropped Brown to 212. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy and I kind of fed off each other early, and it was a shame to see her 
finish like she did after the round she had," Gerring said. 
</P>
<P>
Tied with Lopez at 213 are Danielle Ammaccapane and Cindy Rarick. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was shaky in the beginning, barely saving par on the second hole and then 
bogeying No. 3 -- a 455-yard par five. But when she holed No. 5 for a birdie 
with a 15-yard chip, she seemed to be fairly solid, birdieing No. 7 to move to 
six under. 
</P>
<P>
But on the back nine, Lopez had trouble. "I hit well, but I second-guessed some 
putts and there were a couple of short ones that I missed," said Lopez. "I read 
the putts to break to Malvern (Avenue, which runs by the course), but then I 
didn't trust them. I closed the face of the club and opened it. Sometimes I let 
my hands take over, and I need to trust my putter, trust myself." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez had three consecutive bogeys on Nos. 12-14 to stay at three under par the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I am hitting well enough. I just need to be aggressive," said Lopez, 
the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
Keggi, whose best finish in her two years on the tour was a playoff with 
Gerring in August, got off to a fast start, birdieing Nos. 2 and 3 and making a 
25-foot birdie putt on No. 10 to take the lead at eight under par. She sank a 
two-foot putt to birdie No. 13, bogeyed No. 14 when she hit a four-iron over 
the green and made a 20-foot putt on No. 16 to finish at nine under. 
</P>
<P>
"I really only hit two bad shots all day: my approach to 14 and my tee shot on 
18," Keggi said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lopez: "Caroline is a long-ball hitter. She can reach all the greens." 
</P>
<P>
But she also has a good short game. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no pressure on any part of my game today," Keggi said. "When I 
missed a shot, I didn't have to worry about my short game." 
</P>
<P>
Gerring, a 29-year-old from Dublin, Ohio, earned her first LPGA victory this 
season at Hershey, Pa., and her second title came at Stratton Mountain, Vt., in 
a playoff with Keggi. 
</P>
<P>
"Caroline and I are good friends. We were at Ohio State together before she 
transferred (to the University of New Mexico)," Gerring said. "If I can't win 
tomorrow, then I hope she does." 
</P>
<P>
Gerring had her best years in 1986 and 1987, when she finished 17th and 21st, 
respectively, on the money list. But she took off 1988 to have a child, 
Zachary, and said she is just now getting her game back together. 
</P>
<P>
Keggi seems to have no distractions. But then she has never been in this 
position before, leading going into the final round.

Trainer Charles Carlesimo neglected to send co-owner Gregory Mordas' silks to 
Belmont Park when he shipped Quick Mischief for Saturday's 1 1/16-mile Ruffian 
Handicap. He was unaccustomed to such details, having never before run a horse 
in a Grade I stakes. 
</P>
<P>
The jockeys' agents at Belmont were not exactly clamoring for the opportunity 
to ride the 4-year-old filly, whose career was defined by a nine-length victory 
at Monmouth Park more than 15 months ago. Her 111-pound assignment also limited 
the number of riders eligible to make the weight. 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo was concerned that Quick Mischief might not be up to facing 
Southland-based Gorgeous, one of the leading older fillies bound for next 
month's Breeders' Cup Distaff. But Gorgeous was scratched from the Ruffian 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thrilled that Gorgeous was scratched," Carlesimo said. "And it came up 
slop, which we like." 
</P>
<P>
When Carlesimo looked through his binoculars toward the quarter pole Saturday, 
he saw Quick Mischief comfortably in front and jockey Raul Rojas, clad in 
substitute blue silks marked with a white "X" -- the New York Racing Assn.'s 
version of the house blazer -- looking over his shoulder for competition and 
finding none. 
</P>
<P>
She was in control with three-eighths to run after six furlongs in 1:09 4/5. 
From there, her lead widened to three lengths at the wire in 1:42 4/5. Quick 
Mischief paid $16.40 and earned $144,480, more than doubling her previous 
earnings of $111,280. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Krone rode Safely Kept to victory in the Meadowlands Budweiser Breeders 
Cup. Safely Kept, who was timed in 1:09 1/5 for the six furlongs, paid $3, 
$2.40 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Southland-based Itsallgreektome, the 3-5 favorite, scored his fourth stakes 
victory on the turf in his last six races by defeating Noble Dr. by a length in 
the Grade III Ascot Handicap at Bay Meadows. Itsallgreektome completed the 1 
1/16 miles on the turf in 1:43 1/5 and paid $3.40, $2.60 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
Hansel closed with a late rush along the rail to win the Washington-Arlington 
Futurity at Arlington International Racecourse. Hansel, who was timed in 1:36 
2/5 for the mile, paid $4.80, $2.80 and $2.20.

UNBRIDLED WILL TAKE ON 'SQUALL; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: THEY WILL GIVE TODAY'S SUPER DERBY ONE OF THE BEST FIELDS IN ITS 
11-YEAR HISTORY.

When the 1 1/4-mile Super Derby was proposed for Louisiana Downs 11 years ago, 
the idea was to bring together the best 3-year-olds after they had run the 
Triple Crown races in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time, the race has landed two horses who won Triple Crown 
races. Their trainers expect a classic showdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to stick my neck out, but it almost seems to me that he likes 
this track better than any he's been on," said Neil Howard, trainer of 6-5 
early line favorite Summer Squall, who galloped 1 1/2 miles Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Howard noted that Summer Squall has done about 80% of his training at Churchill 
Downs, and compared Louisiana Down's surface favorably with that of the 
Kentucky track. 
</P>
<P>
"It has more clay and is a little firmer than a lot of other tracks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the race strategy that jockey Pat Day will follow, Howard said: "We'll 
probably just lay off there during the early part and see what happens. Pat 
usually handicaps the race, so I won't tell him much." 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, the 5-2 early second choice, also galloped early Saturday, trainer 
Carl Nafzger said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no excuses," Nafzger said. "He has run on about nine tracks 
before. And we ran him on the turf the last time (in the Secretariat Stakes at 
Arlington) because I wanted to find out what I had." 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger called the field "well-balanced" and said four or five horses have a 
chance for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
He said Southland-based Cee's Tizzy, who has won impressively in California, 
and Stalwart Charger are major threats. 
</P>
<P>
Much more than the $600,000 first-place money is at stake. Unbridled and Summer 
Squall are the leading candidates for 3-year-old of the year, and horse of the 
year wouldn't be out of reach of the winner.

Lou Rowan rallied from mid-pack to upset Eddie Champion by a head in the 
$53,250 Derby Trial Stakes at Fairplex Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Patiently handled by apprentice Omar Berrio, Lou Rowan saved ground down the 
backstretch before swinging three wide into the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Champion finished 3 1/4 lengths ahead of pace-setting Stan's Lad in the 1 
1/16-mile feature. Favored Express It finished sixth after breaking slowly and 
racing wide throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the distance in 1:43 1/5, Lou Rowan returned $20.00. 
</P>
<P>
"I always said that I had a good horse," trainer Paul Mazzone said of the 
winner. "I'm not sure where we'll go next. We'll see how he comes out of the 
race." 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Lou Rowan won a $32,000 maiden claiming race at Los Alamitos. The 
Water Bank colt again came from off the pace Saturday when Stans Lad, Irish 
Overture and Eddie Champion battled through fast early fractions.

victory over Mt. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio (2-1, 0-1) at the Santa Ana Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton amassed 236 total yards, including 147 rushing in 29 carries. He also 
caught five passes for 55 yards. In two games, he has 489 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago took a 17-2 first-half lead on touchdown runs of 11 and three 
yards by Crayton and a 47-yard field goal by Tim Hatcher. After a third-quarter 
seven-yard scoring run by Crayton, Mt. San Antonio closed the gap to 23-16 on 
Mike Smith's scoring runs of one and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons increased their lead to 30-16 on a 63-yard scoring drive capped by 
Crayton's one-yard run with 9:39 left. Val Leedy's recovery of a Mountie fumble 
on the Mt. San Antonio 1 set up Crayton's final score with 1:06 remaining. TOM

BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: IT'S UP TO INDIVIDUALS TO FIGHT THE WAR ON POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MURRAY WEIDENBAUM, MURRAY WEIDENBAUM is director of the Center for the Study 
of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis and author of a new 
paperback edition of Rendezvous With Reality.

<P>
The most recent debates on income distribution in the United States have 
degenerated into a clash among statisticians and those who use those 
statistics. Some experienced analysts conclude, from their inspection of the 
data, that the distribution of income is becoming more unequal, and especially 
that the upper income classes are gaining at the expense of people with lower 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, other professionals conclude that the degree of income equality 
did not change significantly in the 1980s and that, when fringe benefits and 
income-in-kind payments are properly taken into account, the poverty problem is 
far less severe than it has been portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
I take a "plague on both your houses" view. Whether the total tally of the poor 
has been rising or falling, the hard fact is that there are a great many poor 
people in the United States. The basic thrust of the debate should be shifted 
to a far more useful set of questions: How do people fall into poverty? How can 
they be helped to move out of poverty? 
</P>
<P>
First of all, it is inaccurate for Americans to castigate themselves as a 
heartless society. Over the past 25 years, federal spending for income support 
to individuals multiplied over five times in constant dollars. Any way it is 
measured, the per-capita outlay of public funds to fight poverty has been 
expanding faster than inflation and real outlays also have grown faster than 
the number of poor people. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing problem is that, while these expensive efforts now represent a 
far larger share of the nation's resources than was devoted when Franklin D. 
Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson sat in the Oval Office, the large outlays have 
not produced the promised results. 
</P>
<P>
There is virtually universal agreement in the United States that those who are 
physically or mentally unable to support themselves should be helped by 
society. Such assistance should be provided in adequate amounts and with a 
minimum of hassle. Over the years, however, a profound broadening has occurred 
in the qualification for such aid. Low or no income has become the only basis 
necessary to qualify for the receipt of welfare. The earlier terms, "handouts" 
and "charity," have been transformed into "transfer payments" and 
"entitlements." 
</P>
<P>
Many long-term welfare recipients are beset by deep-rooted personal and social 
problems not quickly cured by money. There is a powerful connection between the 
health of the family as an institution and the depths of the poverty problem. 
</P>
<P>
A few examples will help. Nine out of 10 families on welfare are headed by 
women. Men living alone have twice the unemployment rates of family men. Nearly 
three-fourths of the children on welfare are on the rolls because neither of 
their parents is willing to support them. Frequently, the father has left the 
home or never took responsibility for the child in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Without judging the moral basis of these alternative lifestyles, it is apparent 
that much of the cost of such actions is not borne by the individuals making 
those decisions, but by the children and by society as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Focusing on a positive approach, a distinguished panel of both liberal and 
conservative analysts issued a report, "The New Consensus on Family and 
Welfare." The panel stated, "An indispensable resource in the war against 
poverty is a sense of personal responsibility." The panel also noted that 
climbing out of poverty is something the individual must do, albeit with some 
help from society. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, all it takes for a person to leave the ranks of the poor 
is three things: 1) completing high school, 2) getting and staying married 
(even if not on the first try), and 3) staying employed, even if at modest pay 
such as the statutory minimum wage. The three factors are closely interrelated. 
The high school diploma helps in getting a job. The wages received enable the 
person to get married and to begin raising a family. The obligation to support 
a family encourages the person to stick with the job or to quickly find 
another. 
</P>
<P>
An examination of the available data is useful in destroying some widely held 
myths. Poverty is primarily a children's, not a senior citizens', problem. 
Three and a half million of the elderly are poor, while 13 million children 
are. About three-fourths of the elderly own their homes. The average family 
headed by someone 65 to 74 years of age holds more than twice the dollar assets 
than the typical family headed by a person 35 to 44 years old. The older the 
head of the family, the wealthier the family is likely to be -- through age 74. 
</P>
<P>
Also, very few men, black or white, who are heads of households are even near 
poverty -- if they just have a high school education. In 1986, less than 5% of 
black males and less than 10% of black females who met these simple 
requirements were in poverty. Of adult black males who were high school 
graduates in 1986, 86% had family incomes more than twice the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
When a woman on welfare takes on a full-time job, the odds are overwhelming 
that she is lifting herself out of poverty. Few women working steadily earn 
only the minimum wage. The median annual earnings of full-time female workers 
without a high school diploma are higher than the minimum wage. Raising a child 
is often cited as a reason for unmarried women staying on welfare. The fact is 
that most mothers are now working, including a slight majority of those with 
children under six. 
</P>
<P>
There is much that government can and should do to reduce poverty. That 
includes conducting a sensible macroeconomic policy that yields a growing 
economy, which in turn generates a rising supply of jobs. Strengthening the 
educational system -- perhaps by opening up more competition -- would surely 
help. And continuing to provide large sums of money to alleviate distress will 
be necessary for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the most important actions generating poverty are personal -- 
producing children out of wedlock, getting divorced, dropping out of school and 
waiting for the dream job to come along before starting to work. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, however, the message that arises from any detailed examination of 
poverty in the United States is upbeat. The solution is within reach of most 
people. Marriage and family prevent poverty. Schooling prevents poverty. 
Working at almost any job prevents poverty. Individual actions -- rather than 
more generous government expenditures -- are required to escape the poverty 
trap.

COLUMN ON OVERHAULING THE PATENT SYSTEM CONTAINS SEVERAL FLAWS, ATTORNEY 
CONTENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Schrage's column, "Inventing Ways to Speed Up Patent System," (Sept. 6) 
chose to use the microprocessor patent of Gilbert Hyatt, which was pending for 
20 years in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as a jumping off point to 
expound on his perceived need for changes in the Patent Office. Schrage states 
that Hyatt filed seven continuation applications in the long string leading to 
the issuance of the patent. He then adds the attorney-bashing statement, 
"Patent attorneys love continuations: They bring more money." 
</P>
<P>
This cheap shot is, in my 10 years of experience as a patent attorney both in 
private and corporate practice, unfounded. In attempting to obtain a patent for 
a client, patent attorneys typically only file continuation applications when 
it is in the best interest of the client, as when the Patent Office has not yet 
been persuaded to grant a patent of reasonable breadth. The client typically 
has the option of filing or walking away without a patent. 
</P>
<P>
Schrage said the Patent Office is "less enthusiastic" about continuations (than 
lawyers) but is apparently ignorant of the fact that by generating early final 
rejections, and thus forcing continuations, the Patent Office is able to 
collect additional application fees. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the few areas of government to depend largely on user fees rather 
than taxpayer financing, the Patent Office, by accepting additional 
continuations fees, is able to better fund itself. 
</P>
<P>
Schrage also states that by jumping to a law firm, a patent examiner with 
several years experience can double his or her salary. This ignores the fact 
that patent examiners are not attorneys, and thus cannot easily join law firms 
without first going to law school. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion that a satellite office could be opened in California also 
illustrates the writer's ignorance of the Patent Office's operation. The office 
has immense stacks of millions of documents, all of which are categorized. 
Duplicating this on the West Coast would be incredibly expensive. While patent 
searches one day will be performed electronically, that day has not yet 
arrived, and examiners must still wade through the stacks to perform searches. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Schrage suggests that patent attorneys and large companies pay 
additional fees to support the Patent Office. Larger companies currently pay 
double the fees of smaller firms and individuals. His "soak the rich" theory of 
charging patent attorneys is equally foolish, since such additional fees would 
only get passed on to all clients, further increasing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the anomaly of the Hyatt patent, the U.S. patent system works 
considerably better than those of other nations. The average time of 18 to 24 
months between filing and issuance is unmatched. It typically takes four or 
five years to obtain a patent in Europe. In Japan, the wait for a first 
examination is 4 1/2 years, with the typical wait upwards of six years.

Officially, the 32nd annual Greek Festival, being celebrated today at Santa 
Anita Park in Arcadia, is intended to honor the 2,500th birthday of democracy 
in ancient Greece. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done quite a bit of research on this and we're not just pulling a date 
out of thin air," said festival chairman John Tarazi. "They're celebrating in 
Greece, too." 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, however, the idea is for festival-goers to stuff themselves silly 
on platefuls of moussaka and honey-drenched kataifi pastries, to down ouzo, and 
to join the costumed dancers doing the tsamiko. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, sponsored by St. Anthony's Greek Orthodox Church in Pasadena, 
usually attracts between 10,000 and 15,000 visitors each year, and has the 
distinction of being the most elaborate and the oldest Greek cultural fair in 
Southern California. In its early years, the festival was held on the church 
grounds after services on Sunday, Tarazi said, but it was moved to the race 
track in 1976 because of the surge in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get the community to know us, to get familiar with our language 
and our food and dance, to see that we are not strangers," Tarazi said. 
</P>
<P>
The church's 450 families do all the work for the festival and the proceeds go 
to various charity projects sponsored by the church, including Orthodox 
missionaries around the world and a boy's home in Yucaipa. The church members 
bake 11 varieties of pastries and make the gyros, rice pilaf, dolmathes 
(stuffed grape leaves) and other Hellenic delicacies served during the fair. 
</P>
<P>
This year, a highlight will be performances by the church's award-winning 
children's dance troupe, Tarazi said. A Greek dancing teacher will also be on 
hand to lead willing members of the crowd through some steps to the rhythm of 
the Hellenic Sounds band. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the final day of the festival. It runs from noon to 9 p.m. Admission 
is $3 for adults, $1 for senior citizens and free for children 14 and under 
when accompanied by adults. There are additional charges for food. Parking at 
the race track is free. KAREN E. KLEIN

</P>
<P>
The trail, with an 1,850-foot elevation gain, traverses deep ravines and 
forests of pine, spruce and incense cedar. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Deer Flats, take Highway 39 north from the Foothill Freeway, go to 
the Crystal Lake Recreation Area and follow the yellow center line past the

FORBIDDEN TRASH, CREEPING FASCISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though it may sound odd coming from the sleepy San Gabriel Valley, democracy 
seems willing to enlist just a little "fascism" to prevent the deteriorating 
"history and reputation" of local real estate ("Front yard faux pas," Times, 
Sept. 16), and contrary to the remark by Director Rick Cole ("Hopefully, we're 
not talking about crabgrass fascism here"), the property maintenance ordinances 
being deliberated by Pasadena city officials are the vehicles for this lively 
yet oppressive authoritarianism. 
</P>
<P>
The informative article written by Vicki Torres delivers a vivid image of 
"clothes drying (outside), cars on blocks, broken-down sofas, abandoned 
refrigerators and busted steps" scattered throughout Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Wow! That's enough filth to DEMAND city authorities use "health, safety and 
land-use codes" (which are already on the books) to purge the city. But Deputy 
City Atty. Carolyn Williams takes cover in a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court decision 
which, in her words, grants cities authority over the "spiritual" and 
"aesthetic" behavior of citizens -- areas in which only a despot can have an 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Can't we lighten up a little? We know there are already laws in effect to 
handle forbidden trash; we've heard a serious official question the term 
"fascism," and in Torres' article it's admitted, "judges are often reluctant to 
levy heavy fines and penalties. . . ." With "conform or go to jail," how deeply 
do we nick our faith in the future of private property? Dare we prefer 
architectural bragging rights over the established principles of government? 
Without dipping into fascism, can we legislate the spiritual and aesthetic?

neighborhood association. Mr. Gilmore was giving his opinion as a private 
citizen, not as a spokesperson for our neighborhood association. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn. has taken no position as yet on 
the proposed Pasadena property maintenance ordinance. The board of directors of 
the Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn. feels the issue is a complex and 
important one that requires careful study as well as the input of our 
membership. A neighborhood position on the proposed ordinance is now being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
In future, should you wish comments on issues from our neighborhood 
association, I would hope you would contact someone who is authorized to speak 
in our behalf. Being a dues-paying member, as Mr. Gilmore is, does not convey 
that privilege or responsibility. The task of speaking for the Bungalow Heaven 
Neighborhood Assn. is best left to its elected board of directors.

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: POMONA FOES AGREE -- SOMEWHAT, FOR A WHILE

Singing Harmony -- Pomona Mayor Donna Smith and Councilwoman Nell Soto are 
political enemies with nothing in common, it seems. But they were singing the 
same tune -- more or less -- after last week's special election to choose a new 
council member. 
</P>
<P>
Both said this is a good time for the council's warring factions to bury the 
hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, Smith couldn't resist crowing a little about picking up a political ally on 
the council in Boyd Bredenkamp, who had defeated Soto's choice, Bob Dahms. "I 
never doubted for a minute that Boyd would win," she said by phone from South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
But she added a hope that Bredenkamp -- who is as cautious in his statements as 
his predecessor, C.L. (Clay) Bryant, was rash -- might help restore peace. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a message out there," Smith said. "I think that the entire City 
Council has to recognize that the community wants stability." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the council meetings don't produce harmony, they are likely to be 
shorter than the marathon sessions that were routine when Bryant was in office. 
The council is limiting its agenda to 15 items a meeting and has cut back on 
its meetings from weekly to twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
Party Crasher -- Why is KABC radio commentator Dennis Prager, a registered 
Democrat, speaking to the Pasadena Republican Club? 
</P>
<P>
That's what some of her fellow board members wanted to know, said Angeli 
DiLucca-Paterson, when she suggested the club invite Prager. More eyebrows were 
raised, she said, when she told them that Prager commands fees for his 
appearances. Pay a Democrat to speak? Unheard of, no doubt, said 
DiLucca-Paterson, but if the Berlin Wall can come down, maybe the barrier 
against Democrats could be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, DiLucca-Paterson said, no one is better than Prager at discussing 
the differences between conservatism and liberalism. So the Republicans will 
bring Prager to Pasadena and have invited everyone, including Democrats, to 
hear him talk on "Liberalism vs. Conservatism: A Moral Question" at 7:30 p.m. 
Thursday at the Pasadena Center, 300 E. Green St. Admission is $20, with a 
half-price discount to students with ID.

<P>
Debatable -- The American Assn. of Retired Persons has criticized Reps. David 
Dreier (R-La Verne) and Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) for rejecting its 
invitations to debate their election opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Weinstein, spokesman for the group's voter education arm, AARP/Vote, said 
the organization will stage political forums anyway and will set up empty 
chairs for the missing legislators if they persist in their refusals. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier's aide, Brad Smith, said his boss didn't exactly turn down the AARP 
invitation. Instead, Dreier suggested that the organization join two other 
groups -- the Whittier Area Chamber of Commerce and a local realty board -- as 
a sponsor of a candidates forum already set for 7:30 a.m. Oct. 23, at Hinshaw's 
Auditorium, 13550 Whittier Blvd., Whittier. But AARP insisted on hosting its 
own forum. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier and his two 33rd District opponents -- Democrat Georgia Houston Webb and 
Libertarian Gail Lightfoot -- will share the Whittier program with candidates 
from the 52nd and 59th Assembly districts. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Torres, meanwhile, said he has not ruled out participation in 
an AARP-sponsored debate but is trying to negotiate a suitable time. Torres' 
opponent in the 34th District is Republican John Eastman. 
</P>
<P>
The only congressman to accept an AARP invitation so far is Rep. Carlos 
Moorhead (R-Glendale), who has agreed to debate his opponent, David Bayer, at 1 
p.m. Nov. 2 at the First United Methodist Church in Pasadena. MIKE WARD

THE MAN NOW IN CHARGE OF NEW YORK CITY BALLET ANSWERS HIS CRITICS AS HE GIVES 
NEW DIRECTION TO THE BALANCHINE LEGEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GRESKOVIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The upcoming "new" year for New York City Ballet, which begins with its 
one-week season on Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, marks 
the first year that Peter Martins is officially, single-handedly in charge of 
the company that George Balanchine left. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, a few months before Balanchine died, City Ballet formally announced 
that the artistic directorship had transferred jointly to Martins and Jerome 
Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ballet year that ended in July, Robbins relinquished his title as 
co-Ballet Master in Chief. His departure followed the resignation last 
September of Lincoln Kirstein, who had been general director since he founded 
City Ballet with Balanchine in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 These prominent shifts have led to the coining of "Peter's company" to 
describe City Ballet today. Speaking by phone from his Connecticut country 
house, the Danish-born ballet master said emphatically, if softly, "No, no, 
absolutely not," to the notion of specifically emphasizing his name now that 
Robbins and Kirstein have left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Jerry and Lincoln are around, are as involved as they were prior to 
their announcements. What they say is that they are leaving to me all 
responsibility of everyday issues." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, a year after his mentor's death, Martins stated the following in a 
book on Balanchine: "His last advice to me about continuing the company was, 
'Declare war. Don't accept anything you don't believe in. Begin from scratch if 
you need to. If my setup doesn't work for you, change it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martins laughed as he was reminded of this "war" prerogative, almost as if 
he'd forgotten the advice. "I've come close, but no, I haven't done it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The ballet world's facets -- its audiences, fans, critics, dancers and 
administrators -- have all, at one time or another, become something of an 
extra complication for Martins as he acted to oversee the cultural institution 
that Balanchine built. While the Russian-born visionary was developing and 
guiding City Ballet, everyone who followed it was learning from its example. As 
Martins has put into practice what he learned on the inside -- working with 
Balanchine as both dancer and choreographer -- others, citing the lessons they 
gained from the outside, have not hesitated to voice their doubts about 
Martins' regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics commented on ill-presented ballets and on undeveloped dancer talent. 
Dancers expressed their lack of fulfillment in the company by leaving it to 
seek work in lesser-known American and European ballet companies. Some part of 
the company's loyal audience drifted away, sometimes because of a lessened 
emphasis on Balanchine's work. Enthusiasts of such retired artists as Suzanne 
Farrell wondered why such knowledgeable sources were not a significant part of 
the company's artistic staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Responses of "yes and no," examples of changes that are not really changes, 
and references to business-as-usual frequently surface in Martins' 
conversation. But the slightly defensive, noncommittal answers are mixed with 
others that reconsider his current thinking on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 As Martins responded to questions concerning controversial issues, he spoke 
more conciliatory than fighting words. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: What's your current enthusiasm level for your own choreography? At 
the end of your dancing career and the start of your directorship, you voiced 
real eagerness for the task. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: It becomes a pragmatic issue more than a desire to choreograph -- you 
need a ballet and this particular person hasn't had one for a while, so you 
know you have to do a ballet for him or her. For the most part, it's not like 
in the old days, before I had any obligations, where I would stumble upon a 
piece of music and go, "Wow, this is great." 
</P>
<P>
Q: The repertory for this seven-performance stint includes 13 ballets: eight by 
Balanchine, three by Robbins and two by you. How typical is this ratio, in 
general? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sixty percent Balanchine, 30% Jerry and 10% me, something like that. These 
basically are the proportions I try to go by. 
</P>
<P>
I always say my two biggest functions are, first, to make sure the Balanchine 
heritage is being taken care of, to the best of our ability, and second, to 
make sure that it does not become the sole purpose of the company and that 
obviously leads to the creative aspect. If I don't make sure that the company 
can remain creative, we're going to have a big, big problem. I have dancers who 
shall remain nameless who pray (for new work). They don't care who choreographs 
it, as long as (Balanchine's now classic) "Serenade" isn't the only thing they 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about some place for Suzanne Farrell on staff since she officially 
retired from the stage last December? 
</P>
<P>
A: She and I have had a series of conversations over the summer and she is 
going to begin here now in the fall. She's going to come in, to be . . . I hate 
the word "coach," but I guess there's nothing closer than that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How about the development of dancers -- the use of repertory to make 
well-trained dancers into compelling performing artists? 
</P>
<P>
A: First, I have never seen such talent like this in my life, on both sides, 
boys and girls, men and women. My big problem right now is to feed all these 
people. Somehow Balanchine managed, either he had less talent (available) or 
was more prolific or was better to spot it and provide for them. Who the hell 
knows? You find yourself hiring talented people, and what you don't want is for 
them to get lost. You can't give everybody everything, which I have tended to 
do in the beginning, to kind of homogenize everybody, and everybody has the 
same amount. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does this mean that Anna Kisselgoff, New York Times' chief dance critic, is 
accurate noting, amid her generally high opinion of the company: "If there is 
one major criticism to be made it is that more attention has been paid to 
keeping up this uniformly high level (of ensemble proficiency) than to singling 
out new individuals as the principals of the future." 
</P>
<P>
A: That's her opinion. I'd answer yes and no. You can't make somebody have 
"that" if they don't have it, and if they have it, you can't suppress it. I 
think it's much less a case of policy than of circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And what of critics, in general, some of whom, once the company's biggest 
admirers, are now some of its most sharp detractors? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't think you want me to get started on this subject, but in general, 
yes, I do think you need criticism, critical response to what you do on stage, 
and, it goes without saying, you have to take the good with the bad. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the company's strength in the area of the cavalier, the partner, 
the key counterpart to the Balanchine tenet of the supremacy of the ballerina? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's a problem -- it's always a problem. It's not just a matter of being 
able to partner, it's a matter of height. I have many good dancers that are 
small and that are very good partners, but I can't put them with (big 
ballerinas). Or, I have some dancers that are tall, that are very talented 
</P>
<P>
partners, who are not ready to be put out there in a major thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about overall company height? Some observers have noted, unfavorably, 
that the company once famed for its large-scale performers is now looking 
small-scale. 
</P>
<P>
A: I must say of late I have found myself hiring what I call small girls, 
because there is a whole part of Balanchine's rep that requires them, but also 
because there are an awful lot of good ones you tend to grab the ones that are 
good, even if you don't need them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does this mean a personal preference? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, I wouldn't say that. There's been a shortage of tall dancers of late and 
I've had sessions with the faculty (of the School of American Ballet) that goes 
out and scouts and said to them, "Please, look at their feet, look at their mom 
and dad, look at their hands, because we are getting too short. Let's get some 
tall dancers!" 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does the Balanchine repertory being performed today look better, worse, or 
the same as it did under Balanchine? 
</P>
<P>
A: OK, I'll open myself up for attack. I think it looks better. Given the 
circumstances, given the dancers, and I'm not saying I prefer the dancers who 
dance his ballets today to the dancers who danced them when he was around. I'd 
say better without a doubt because there's much more attention than was given 
to them when he was around. He'd take "Symphony in C" off the shelf two days 
before and give it 1 1/2 hours and put it out there and it'd look like a 
nightmare. And, by the fifth performance it got pretty all right. He could get 
away with it. We realize we can't. We simply put more time into Balanchine 
ballets than he ever did. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So what about instances where the company's performances have included the 
kinds of mishaps -- with partnering or pointe work -- that were not seen so 
readily in the past? 
</P>
<P>
A: We have become so bureaucratic, so enormous, so perfect in our approach, so 
holy in our approach toward George Balanchine -- and I don't mean to imply that 
we don't consider him holy -- but, the way we prepare his ballets is so 
inflexible, I find myself seeing dancers (acting) much more like (prominent 
foreign companies) or American Ballet Theatre -- if they don't have 17 
rehearsals they can't go on the stage. My whole career was based on learning a 
ballet in three hours and I learned and it made an enormous difference to me. 
I'm trying to get a little bit of that element back because it can make a 
dancer. So maybe the mishaps were my saying, on short notice, "Look, do you 
know the ballet? Fine, go out there tomorrow night." 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the future? 
</P>
<P>
A: For now, we are financially healthy. By that I mean we don't have a deficit 
but, if the New York City Ballet does not have a major endowment before this 
century is over, I think it is fair to assume that there will not be a New York 
City Ballet in the beginning of the next century.

COLOUR-IZING THE ROCK LANDSCAPE; 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN PRINCE OR MICHAEL JACKSON, LIVING COLOUR HAS REINTRODUCED ROCK TO ITS 
BLACK MUSIC HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four members of Living Colour responded to the first question in unison and 
so emphatically it sounded rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
The question was, "Should anyone still care that you're a black hard-rock 
band?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer: "No!" 
</P>
<P>
For all intents, the response was rehearsed. The issue of race has been with 
Living Colour since it began in the mid-'80s, and the band would like nothing 
more than to lose it. After all, Living Colour established itself on grounds 
that have nothing to do with race. 
</P>
<P>
Its 1988 debut album, "Vivid," sold nearly 2 million copies, largely to the 
standard hard-rock market. The album's acceptance came very slowly -- it was 
out for nearly a year before it became a hit, despite the patronage of Mick 
Jagger, who had band member Vernon Reid play on his 1987 solo album "Primitive 
Cool" and produced a couple of the songs on "Vivid." Many, including Living 
Colour, have suggested that initial resistance to the album was due to race, 
though there's no question that the novelty of a black hard-rock band also drew 
critical attention. 
</P>
<P>
But the band did become a hit and more than held its own as the opening act on 
the Rolling Stones' 1989 mega-tour. (Remember, a young Prince was booed 
mercilessly opening for the Stones in the early '80s). And there seems to be no 
resistance to the new album, "Time's Up" -- it leaped into the Billboard 
magazine pop album chart Top 20 after just two weeks in release. 
</P>
<P>
The album beats the sophomore jinx with some intense metal thrash (the title 
track), matured songwriting (the South African-flavored "Solace of You") and a 
funny attack on Presley exploiters ("Elvis Is Dead"). 
</P>
<P>
Still, the uncomfortable and distracting race issue will not die. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it's just wearying, because you deal with it so much," said Reid, the 
New York group's founder and guitarist. "We've done interviews where not a tune 
has been talked about. I saw a review (of 'Time's Up') from England that was 
totally from a point of view . . . dealing with race." 
</P>
<P>
Yet for the better part of the next hour at Epic Records' Century City offices, 
the band addressed the issue readily, presenting articulate arguments 
supporting the notion that their race should be ignored, but also 
well-considered reasons why it cannot. And it's not as if the band has shied 
away from it. The fact is there just aren't many black hard rockers, and none 
that draw the attention that Living Colour has. Even if the band doesn't go to 
the issue, it seems to go to them. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, who started Living Colour after schooling in the free-jazz Harmolodics of 
Ornette Coleman, insisted that the band's name is not meant as a reference to 
skin color -- he said it came from the old Walt Disney television program 
presented "in living color." But Reid, who has written criticism and essays for 
the Village Voice, is also the outspoken founder of the Black Rock Coalition, 
an organization that promotes awareness of rock's black roots and serves as a 
base for social and political activity, including the anti-censorship movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a black-originated art form and a lot of black people don't realize that, 
and they don't associate themselves with rock 'n' roll," said drummer Will 
Calhoun. "I think it's something that should be reiterated into the culture. So 
in that sense, yes, I think the issue should be made." 
</P>
<P>
Singer Corey Glover, a dynamic performer who has also done some acting 
("Platoon"), continued: "The education has to be there to let people know we 
are not doing something alien to our culture, not doing something alien to our 
socio-economic background either. We happen to be black folks, but if you're 
brought up in a society with the range of music and types of music you listen 
to, that's going to be reflected in the music you play. No one asks M. C. 
Hammer why he plays the music he plays. It's expected of him." 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Muzz Skillings added, "We don't think about it, because Vernon grew up 
playing this music, I grew up playing this music, Corey's always wanted to be 
in this kind of band and Will's been doing the same kind of things. In our 
neighborhoods, bands that played rock 'n' roll played the stuff from the 
'Woodstock' album, playing everything on it. So it's no strange thing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Reid, "You go back and forth between thinking it doesn't matter and we're 
just a rock band, and the fact that it's the kind of society that has racism. . 
. . Some people have looked at us and said, 'So what? These guys are black and 
they rock.' They missed the point. We're trying to tell a segment of the 
African-American story, our perspective. That by and of itself makes a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
If Living Colour ever thinks it can ignore the race issue, all it has to do is 
recall last October when it shared the bill with the Stones and Guns N' Roses 
for four nights at the Los Angeles Coliseum. Guns N' Roses was at the height of 
controversy over the use of racial and gay epithets in its song "One in a 
Million." As the shows approached, Reid was quoted in the news media about the 
matter, and Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose was perturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"After we played on that first show I wanted to check out Guns N' Roses to see 
if they were good live," Skillings recalled. "I was standing backstage. I saw 
Axl coming down the stairs and he walks by. But then five minutes later 
somebody taps me on the shoulder. I look up and it's him. 
</P>
<P>
"First thing out of his mouth: 'You got a problem with me, man?' I said, 'What 
you talking about?' So then he goes on, 'It's in the media that I'm some sort 
of racist, man . . . I ain't no damn racist.' He went down this long list: 'I 
don't think you're a (racial epithet). Anyone can be a (epithet). If you're a 
bad person you're a (epithet). I don't think black people are (epithet). I 
don't think black bands are (epithet).' 
</P>
<P>
"And he just went on and on. So then he sticks out his hand and I say we should 
talk about it, just talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
But moments later on stage, Rose attempted to defend the song and managed to 
dig himself in deeper with a string of profanities and slurs that only served 
to further inflame the matter. 
</P>
<P>
On the second night, Reid used the stage to make a brief attack on anti-black 
and anti-gay language before the band launched into a furious version of its 
hit "Cult of Personality." 
</P>
<P>
"We all played a little harder," Calhoun said. "I broke a few more sticks that 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Said Skillings, "Something like that does remind you, it does smack you in the 
face in case you might have dozed off a little bit, that it's reality that 
certain attitudes don't change." 
</P>
<P>
"Type" is the title of one of the new album's key tracks and its first single. 
The song isn't so much about racial stereotypes as the tendency to use labels 
indiscriminately, be they "type O" blood or Abstract Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like people don't take the time or don't have the time to know what 
post-structuralism is or post-modernism," Reid said. "They just say, 'Oh yeah, 
that's modern,' or, 'That's Cubist.' You know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Now Living Colour is confronting its own typing -- apart from the racial 
identification. The first album came with some mystery and intrigue. What does 
a black rock band sound like? How will it be marketed? What kind of audience 
will accept it? Now there's no novelty, and certain expectations -- both in 
terms of sounds and sales -- have been established. 
</P>
<P>
"We're no longer the X-factor," Skillings said. 
</P>
<P>
"When a band does a first album and it does well they have nothing to lose," 
Glover said. "The question becomes how much do you believe in your concept? How 
much do you let people's expectations and the thought of losing your success 
affect your work? And the main thing is it's important to keep your work away 
from that." 
</P>
<P>
"We do this for ourselves first," Skillings said. "But it's not like we do it 
totally for ourselves and (ignore) the audience. It's good to get feedback and 
figure out how you affect people on one level. That's good and healthy. But 
when it gets to the point where people put their own head trips or baggage or 
their own value systems on your music and say, 'I think you guys should be 
doing this or that,' that really has no place." 
</P>
<P>
But if on the tour they learned through the Guns N' Roses episode that the 
racial issue can't be ignored, they learned from the Stones that a band can 
survive on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have gone out and done a tour of their hits," Reid said. "But they 
actually had to support a new album. Their whole thing was the Stones are still 
a viable, vital thing, not a nostalgia band and not trying to cash in on the 
old hits. They went out there trying to pump out the new songs, even with all 
the machinery going on around them."

RECYCLING PROGRAM READY TO ROLL OUT; 
</P>
<P>
GARBAGE: ON MONDAY, MANY RESIDENTS WILL BEGIN SEPARATING REUSABLE MATERIALS 
FROM THEIR TRASH. EFFORT WILL BE CITYWIDE BY FALL, 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years and more than $100 million in the making, Los Angeles' curbside 
garbage recycling program begins Monday, slightly smaller than planned, but on 
schedule and keeping its lofty goal of finding uses for 30% of the city's 
household trash. 
</P>
<P>
The kickoff for what officials say will become the nation's largest municipal 
recycling program was to be marked modestly enough -- with just one sanitation 
truck picking up glass and plastic bottles, aluminum and tin cans, and 
newspapers from about 800 homes in El Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be expanded slowly -- by just one truck route per day, five 
days a week, on alternating weeks through the end of the year, said Drew Sones, 
director of recycling for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shakedown cruise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of homes to be brought into the program daily had to be cut by 
almost half, Sones said, because of delays in contracting for high-tech garbage 
trucks and automated collection bins. A $19-million contract was approved by 
the City Council only last week, and the trucks and bins will not be delivered 
until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
But determined to stick to the schedule, sanitation workers will use existing 
equipment to begin limited recycling in selected Highland Park neighborhoods on 
Tuesday, Elysian Park on Wednesday, Los Feliz/Griffith Park on Thursday and 
Hollywood on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling will then roll out to other North-Central Los Angeles communities 
such as Echo Park, Mt. Washington, Eagle Rock and Glassell Park through 
year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Sanitation officials plan to have 24,000 homes formally in the 
recycling program by Jan. 1, joining the 95,000 Los Angeles households already 
in an experimental program. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be introduced in turn to West Los Angeles in June, the Harbor 
District in July, the East Valley in September, 1991, and the South-Central and 
West Valley areas in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
By September, 1992, city officials plan to have more than 720,000 residences 
separating glass, plastic and metal containers, newspapers and lawn waste from 
their household trash for collection and recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners will be issued at least one yellow plastic bin for collecting 
bottles and cans and two 60-gallon containers -- one each for household trash 
and lawn waste. Initially, lawn waste will be collected only in selected 
neighborhoods on a pilot basis. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers are to be tied or stacked in paper bags and placed at the curb. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, when the program is fully implemented, the city will have invested 
about $360 million in its effort to fully automate trash collection and pare by 
30% the more than 5,000 tons of household trash that are sent daily to 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds more California communities will inaugurate similar programs under 
state legislation requiring every city to reduce its trash stream by at least 
25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. Curbside recycling programs are already 
under way in hundreds of communities, including Santa Monica, Burbank and 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles pilot program, Sones said, about 50% of residents 
voluntarily recycled. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is anxious for it," he said. "People seem to understand the program 
well and want to participate." 
</P>
<P>
To meet the goal of recycling 30% of all trash by 1995, Sones said 80% of all 
residents would have to be participating. The program is intended to be 
mandatory, but Sones said that as long as goals are being met it will be 
operated on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't make the 30% goal by 1995, then we'll trigger an enforcement 
effort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For those about to begin recycling, Sones had a few tips. 
</P>
<P>
Rinse out bottles and cans whenever possible, he said, explaining that "it 
helps us with the quality of the materials" and keeps ants out of the kitchen. 
And of the various plastic bottles used in the home, Sones said, only the PET 
type -- used for soda, milk and water -- are to be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Sones said, "Just start (recycling) and it becomes a natural habit. 
And you know what? You feel better after you do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

SUMMER COMES TO AN END IN NAME ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convertible tops were down all over town on Saturday as summer came to an end 
in Los Angeles on a toasty warm day filled with mixed signals of the changing 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
With only a smattering of puffy clouds and the thermometer touching 81 at the 
Civic Center and 74 at Santa Monica beach, the weather was summer all the way. 
</P>
<P>
Today's weather is expected to be much the same, according to the forecast from 
WeatherData Inc., which supplies meteorological information to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Though a shirtless, barefoot man padded toward the beach in Santa Monica at 
noon, there were other indications throughout the region that the book was 
closing on summer. 
</P>
<P>
Petunias were drooping. Crisp apples were crowding out juicy peaches on 
supermarket shelves. At a Sav-On drugstore on Sepulveda Boulevard, the beach 
hat shelf was bare, but aisles were overflowing with Halloween candy and 
plastic pumpkins. There was only one floating lounge chair, but a whole rack of 
Christmas cards. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, the annual ritual of choosing the 1991 Tournament of Roses Queen 
got under way. At local beaches, about 2,000 gathered to clean up from what 
amounts to a three-month beach party, fanning out with blue and green sacks to 
collect the summer's discards. 
</P>
<P>
The event, part of the sixth annual nationwide Adopt-A-Beach Coastal Clean Up 
Day, yielded everything from underwear to an electric clock, said Susan McCabe 
of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration project, one of the sponsors of the 
cleanup. The most common item found on the beach was cigarette butts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the California Coastal Commission, 12,000 pounds 
of trash and 3,000 pounds of recyclable materials were collected from the sand 
at Los Angeles County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of about 150 had a heavenly purpose for spending the last day of 
summer gathered at the water's edge. The choir, from the Baptist Tabernacle 
Church in downtown Los Angeles, tried mightily to compete with the sound of the 
surf, while children frolicked nearby in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, which had encircled a portable altar, parted and two men of the 
cloth waded out into the ocean and turned back toward the sand. Each fully 
clothed member of the flock pushed past the waves for a baptismal dip in the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Across town in Pasadena, the first step was taken in the selection process for 
the 1991 Pasadena Rose Queen and her court. As birds chirped and pink blossoms 
fell from a kapok tree, 500 young women, most of them in flowery summer 
dresses, walked across a curved path in the Rose Garden at Tournament House. 
</P>
<P>
Each had about 15 seconds or so to tell the nine blue-shirted men why she 
wanted to be Rose Queen. The next step was a photo with one of two bouquets of 
roses that were passed from candidate to candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Bradley, 17, a senior at John Muir High School in Pasadena, got a big 
laugh from the judges. "I told them if I wouldn't have come my mother would 
have had a heart attack," she said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
At Westwood Park, another group of mothers and fathers were heavily involved in 
a seasonal ritual. Soccer season was under way and while a swarm of 6 and 
7-year-old boys in droopy shorts and knee socks chased a ball around the field, 
their parents shrieked encouragement from the sidelines. "Come on, Michael," 
yelled one mother. "Come on, kick the ball," said another. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, the coach let one player know that this is the time of year to get 
serious. "You're going to be out the whole second half if I have to yell at you 
once more." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Appleton, mother of one of the players, said that for her summer ended 
when school started. For a volunteer from Heal the Bay, summer's end was 
signaled by empty parking places in the beach lots. 
</P>
<P>
For the homeless, who slept in the sun on Saturday in the grass at Palisades 
Park overlooking the ocean and on a park bench across the street from the 
Biltmore downtown, the end of summer meant impending months of cold, damp 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Lifeguard Capt. Steve Saylors, who was patrolling the beach, 
had a different way of looking at the seasons. "From a lifeguard's point of 
view, it doesn't matter what the calendar says. If the temperature hits 75 
degrees downtown, everybody goes to the beach," said Saylors. "There is no end 
of summer at the beach.

IF CHILDREN SHOW COURAGE, SO MUST WE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ADULTS IN A RECENT CASE SENT THE WRONG MESSAGE BY REACTING WITH 
DISBELIEF AND SUPPORTING THE ABUSER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY J. PENSO, Deputy Dist. Atty. Penso prosecuted the Stark case. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arrest and recent conviction of Rodney Stark, a Rancho Penasquitos teacher 
and Scoutmaster, have left that community shocked. But even more surprising -- 
and potentially destructive -- is the behavior of some residents who still 
cling to the belief that Stark could not possibly be guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The thought that an adult entrusted with so many youngsters for so many years 
could be capable of sexually molesting children while successfully manipulating 
colleagues and parents contradicts so sharply with our adult belief system that 
our minds want to clamp down in horror and disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
It is this visceral reaction by many of Stark's supporters and colleagues that 
I am most critical of, and I'd like to tell you why. 
</P>
<P>
We are spending thousands of dollars on programs to educate children about 
sexual abuse, to convince them that adults will listen and not turn their backs 
on their horrifying reports of molestation. Yet, adults in the Stark case sent 
their children, all our children, a different message, by blindly and callously 
supporting the abuser, not the victim. 
</P>
<P>
From my personal experience as a prosecutor in child abuse cases, and from a 
rapidly emerging national consensus among experts, we have learned that 
children undertake the very act of disclosing that they are being sexually 
abused with extreme wariness and trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
For a child whose vulnerability and subordination to the adult world are daily 
facts of life, the decision to tell is indeed a very brave one. 
</P>
<P>
In the Stark case, the young victim, legitimately or not, worried about the 
physical safety of the first person in whom he confided and feared he would be 
punished if his parents found out. This is the way a young mind works. After 
all, if his story were true, he had let the molestation go on over several 
years without telling -- and hadn't he shown bad judgment by accompanying this 
man on outings without complaint? 
</P>
<P>
The experts tell us that children become entrapped and eventually accommodate 
the molester because of their fears and guilt, and because there very often is 
a positive, special aspect to the relationship. When the child does tell, he 
realizes he is going to be losing a close friendship. 
</P>
<P>
The child also knows at some level in his psyche, what he is saying is not 
welcome news, and that he will be met with adult disgust and disbelief. This is 
especially true when the molester is a respected and visible community leader. 
</P>
<P>
When the story first broke of Stark's arrest, community members immediately, 
publicly, declared Stark innocent. At the arraignment, a minister and parents 
blindly, and somewhat arrogantly, proclaimed that they would still allow their 
children to be around Stark. 
</P>
<P>
The polarization of the community and insensitivity to the plight of the victim 
and his family rapidly became apparent. Stark's hired investigators combed the 
boy's neighborhood and public school searching for ways to discredit the youth. 
</P>
<P>
Stark dispatched letters to teachers designed to elicit sympathy for himself 
and unearth information with which to attack the boy. The victim was harassed 
by schoolmates and fellow Boy Scouts who quickly learned his identity. 
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary hearing, Stark's supporters callously brought their own 
children to the courtroom in a further attempt to derail the case. In a letter 
circulated among this group, it was naively voiced that if enough people were 
present, the judge might dismiss the case. Fortunately, to protect the victim, 
these children were excluded from the hearing by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Most disturbing of all, at trial, former teachers and an ex-school principal 
came to court to voice strong doubts regarding the boy's credibility. These 
individuals were clearly friends of Stark's and had not seen the boy in two and 
three years. Mind you, this was not a child who had been to Juvenile Hall, 
taken drugs or burned down the library. 
</P>
<P>
These professional educators, who had not bothered to contact the family of the 
boy or learn the facts of the case, completely abandoned all norms of 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the evidence established that the boy was being molested during the 
time he attended Black Mountain Middle School and was in daily contact with 
these individuals. Stark was quickly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
It is simultaneously perplexing and understandable that we, as adults, might go 
to great lengths to deny to ourselves and the world that someone we trusted 
could fool and betray us. This is a very frightening realization. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Melvin Goldzband, an expert in pedophilia, told us in court that the only 
consistent trait of child molesters is that they acquire positions that provide 
them access to children, positions such as youth leaders and teachers. This 
same expert also told us that child molesters are often charming and likeable 
individuals to whom children gravitate. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, two other boys testified that they were molested by Stark. 
</P>
<P>
With great sensitivity, a detective persuaded the boys to come forward and tell 
of their experiences. These boys were extremely reluctant, for they knew of the 
harassment suffered by the original victim and knew we could not guarantee them 
protection. Knowing that they too were going to be met by adult disbelief, they 
valiantly walked into the courtroom to tell the jury what Stark had done to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the course of the trial, numerous members of the community told me 
they simply wished for the truth to come out. Yet these same people also said 
Stark could not be guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The sorry truth is that we must rely on our children to reveal who the 
molesters are. I can only hope that when our children do find the courage to 
tell us, we as adults find the courage to listen.

Hurrah! The trend to build "monster" homes totally out of scale with their lot 
and neighborhood character may be halted by revising current building codes 
("Blockbuster Homes Could Get Busted By Revised Codes," Sept. 9.) 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla and Point Loma are not the only communities suffering from extravagant 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
In North County, the crest of Fairbanks Ranch resembles "hotel row" from a 
distance and Rancho Santa Fe has its share of over-built, over-designed "spec" 
houses -- usually painted pink. 
</P>
<P>
Enough already. If builders and architects need to cater to the owner who must 
make a financial statement of his worth to every passer-by, wouldn't a discreet 
front-lawn sign stating "We are very rich" do just as well?

COUNTY NEEDS FAIR SHAKE ON FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
THE COUNTY DESERVES A BIGGER SHARE WHEN STATE GIVES OUT MENTAL HEALTH MONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine that you made an error in financial judgment some 33 years ago, and you 
are still paying for it today. And paying. And paying. 
</P>
<P>
That's the burden San Diego County -- and many other late-developing California 
counties -- bear today because of mental health policy decisions made decades 
ago. In 1957, when the state was developing its funding policy for 
then-voluntary county mental health programs, San Diego was putting its money 
into its own county mental hospital and didn't jump aboard the gravy train. 
</P>
<P>
When it subsequently did seek state funds for county mental health programs 
(which the state declared mandatory in 1968), funding patterns were already set 
in stone. 
</P>
<P>
The result: San Diego County, with 2.4 million people, today receives $19 per 
capita, $9 less than the state average, and less than a third of the $62 per 
person received by politically powerful San Francisco, whose population is far 
less than half of San Diego's. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of this unfair situation can be seen on San Diego's streets every 
day. Some of those clearly disturbed people you see wandering downtown might be 
receiving help if the system were designed more equitably. Less money means 
fewer mental health clinics and other programs. The county also is limited to a 
horribly disproportionate number of state-funded beds in state mental 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature should straighten the system out. But with Los Angeles and San 
Francisco enjoying better-than-average funding allocations, that hasn't 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the county played its other card when it began court arguments in a 
4-year-old case designed to overturn the system. To do so, the county will make 
two arguments: that the entire funding system violates the equal protection 
clauses of the state and federal constitutions, and that the state is 
consistently violating a 1985 law calling for all newly allocated mental health 
money to be funneled toward counties like San Diego and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's opponents, which include the state attorney general's office and 
the city of San Francisco, argue that communities that were quick to take 
advantage of state funding and build mental health programs shouldn't see their 
efforts crippled by Johnny-come-lately counties like San Diego.

They also claim that, despite its larger size, San Diego may not have the same 
mental health needs as places like San Francisco. But San Diego's lawyers will 
offer epidemiological studies that they say show that mental health needs are 
roughly equal everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys claim San Diego has been shortchanged $8 million to $18 
million annually since 1980 for programs that indirectly affect everyone in the 
county. With that much at stake, the Legislature must find a way to gradually 
give San Diego County its deserved share of mental health funding.

SURPRISE ENROLLMENT RISE RENEWS DEBATE ON SCHOOL CLOSURES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: EXPECTING A DROP OF 370 STUDENTS, PALOS VERDES PENINSULA UNIFIED 
SCHOOLS ACTUALLY ADDED 26. BUT OFFICIALS SAY CONSOLIDATION PLANS WILL PROCEED. 
</P>

<P>
After plummeting for two decades, enrollment in Palos Verdes Peninsula schools 
rose slightly this fall, although district officials say the increase is not 
enough to forestall closures of under-used campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The increase of at least 26 students over last year's figures was particularly 
surprising because the district's demographer, D. G. King Associates, had 
predicted in April that enrollment would drop by 370 students this fall. 
</P>
<P>
To handle the difference, the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District 
hired two additional teachers and said more may be hired as the year 
progresses. District enrollment stood at 8,965 last week, compared to the 1989 
year-end figure of 8,939. Based on previous years, the current enrollment is 
expected to go up slightly as the 1990-91 academic year progresses, district 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators and school board members said they are delighted with the extra 
$3,000 per student in state funds that the enrollment increase will bring to 
the financially strapped schools. However, they said consolidation of school 
campuses is still a necessity because all the district's school sites are 
under-utilized, except Ridgecrest Intermediate in Rancho Palos Verdes, which is 
near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The district's intermediate schools gained 131 students this year, elementary 
schools gained 13 and the high schools lost 118. At Miraleste High School, 
which the board has proposed closing, enrollment of seventh- and eighth-graders 
rose from 200 to 246, although high school enrollment dropped by 42 students, 
from 608 to 566. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jack Bagdasar called the overall enrollment increase minuscule 
and said some form of consolidation will "absolutely" take place. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jeffrey Younggren called the increase "not enough of a trend to 
make sweeping statements about the future of this district. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it signifies a tremendous influx of students," Younggren said. 
"I don't think this kind of a rise indicates we can avoid consolidation. Fifty 
more kids or 100 more kids is not going to make a difference. We need 4,000 
more kids." 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in Palos Verdes schools has fallen steadily since it peaked in 1973 
with 17,800 students. In recent years, five elementary and two intermediate 
schools have been shut, leaving 13 campuses. Since the late 1970s, the district 
has sold seven undeveloped school sites and leased three closed schools. 
</P>
<P>
The job of balancing the district's budget has also become increasingly 
difficult as state funding based on enrollment has declined. The board cut 
close to $3 million from its budget this year and dipped into the district's 
reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that the decline has turned around," said Supt. Michael W. 
Caston. "That would be the best thing to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Caston said board members would have to review consolidation options if the 
enrollment increase "becomes a trend and is not just a one-time glitch." 
</P>
<P>
Parents opposed to consolidation argue that the increase shows the district has 
been exaggerating its predictions of future enrollment losses to support its 
decision to close Miraleste. They see the increase as a signal that district 
enrollment has reached its nadir and is finally on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to be closing school sites when enrollment is increasing," said 
Nancy Bolton, a parent who opposes the closing of Miraleste. "I would hope that 
the board would view this as a turnaround in the whole situation. I would think 
that this would be a cause for celebration for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Battle lines have been drawn in the district for the past three years over the 
proposed closing of Miraleste in Rancho Palos Verdes, on the east side of the 
peninsula. A group of east side parents, who formed the East Peninsula 
Education Council, filed a lawsuit against the district to stop the closure. A 
Los Angeles judge ordered the district in 1988 to produce an environmental 
impact report on the Miraleste closing and any other proposed school closures. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the report, which was made public in June, fails to adequately 
analyze the potential environmental and other disruptions that could result 
from closing the only high school on the peninsula's east side. Public hearings 
on the report are to be scheduled later this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, parents also sought to form a new school district on the east side 
of the peninsula to maintain kindergarten-through-high school education there. 
But state officials denied their request for an election. 
</P>
<P>
Despite assertions by board members that school closures are inevitable, east 
side parents have argued that cutting administrative ranks would save the 
district more money and that the closing of public schools only drives more 
students to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they do not know what caused this year's enrollment 
increase. However, Nancy Mahr, a district spokeswoman, noted that Le Lycee 
Francais de Los Angeles, a bilingual private school in Torrance, closed in June 
and some of its 100 students may have enrolled in the district. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said tuition at area private schools increased this fall, 
possibly prompting some parents to enroll their children in the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
At Chadwick School, where tuition ranges from $7,380 for kindergarten through 
sixth grade to $8,670 for high school, a few students transferred to Palos 
Verdes public schools, but no more than usual, said Director David Harman. He 
said Chadwick, despite its tuition increase, has a record enrollment of 718 
students this fall and continues to maintain a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
District officials also said the enrollment increase may be the result of a 
recent decline in real estate prices throughout Southern California, widely 
perceived as creating a so-called buyer's market. Bagdasar speculated that more 
families with children may be moving into the district.

AILING DETECTIVE WHO HELPED MANY GETS AID FROM GRATEFUL EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo Police Detective Roger Kahl is used to going out of his way for 
other people, especially children. 
</P>
<P>
When a Little League team needs coaching, folks turn to Kahl. If a teacher 
suspects a child is being abused, she knows Kahl can tell her what to do. When 
a youngster gets himself thrown out of the house, he knows he can go to Kahl 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
So when the residents of El Segundo heard that the 24-year police veteran has 
been stricken with a rare form of leukemia and needed some help himself, they 
decided to provide it in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few weeks, the town will be dedicating itself to Kahl with two 
events -- Roger's Run and Roger's Game -- intended to raise money to save 
Kahl's life. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 14 run, a 5-K jogging and walking race for adults and a one-mile race 
for children, is being sponsored by the Police Department and the El Segundo 
Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo High School students are creating Roger's Game by dedicating their 
Sept. 26 home football contest to Kahl. They hope to raise about $1,800 through 
admission fees and concession sales. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of both events plan to put the money they raise toward the cost of 
finding a bone marrow donor for their favorite police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Kahl, 49, a soft-spoken man who clearly does not like it when people make a 
fuss over him, said he is looking at the two events as yet another way for him 
to help other people. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to get a bone marrow drive going, to get people to sign up 
to be donors," Kahl said. "Lots of people, hundreds of people, could use a bone 
marrow transplant to stay alive. People who sign up because of this may say 
they're doing it for me, but they may match someone else, and that life is just 
as important to save." 
</P>
<P>
Kahl has not always been so willing to talk about his disease. 
</P>
<P>
When doctors told him seven years ago that he has chronic myelogenous leukemia, 
they also told him there wasn't much they could do for him. Most victims die of 
the disease within three to four years. 
</P>
<P>
After what he describes as "an initial period of being very mad," Kahl said he 
decided simply to get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that, especially in this line of work, there's always a chance I could 
go out there today and get shot in an armed robbery," Kahl said. "You can't 
live your life just waiting for it to end." 
</P>
<P>
With scarcely a word to anyone in the community about his illness, Kahl 
continued his work as a juvenile detective, tracking down child abusers and 
molesters, comforting young victims and collaring adolescent transgressors. 
</P>
<P>
After his two children -- Shawna, 20, and Brett, 22 -- went off to college 
three years ago, Kahl and his wife, Donna, decided to adopt a 5-year-old boy, 
Phillip. 
</P>
<P>
Although the leukemia occasionally made him feel ill or weak, Kahl said he 
largely was able to ignore it. But in January, the illness began enlarging his 
spleen. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew things were beginning to accelerate," he said. "I could feel my body 
saying, 'Pull your head out of the sand, son, and start dealing with this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, Kahl said he was rummaging around the house looking for a 
new book to read when he came across a large packet of literature about 
leukemia that he had avoided reading. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he read the booklets. 
</P>
<P>
"They were telling me, basically, I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
The booklets also mentioned bone marrow transplants but noted that the 
procedure usually requires taking marrow from a sibling. Kahl has no brothers 
or sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"This material was pretty old, keep in mind, so I talked to my doctor about 
it," Kahl said. "He said, 'Well, things have changed. Are you interested?' " 
</P>
<P>
What Kahl found out was that in the years since his disease was diagnosed, a 
computerized National Marrow Donor Program had been set up in St. Paul, Minn., 
to help patients find an exact tissue match outside their immediate families. 
More than 200,000 volunteers had registered to help people like him. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of finding a non-related donor, program spokeswoman Liz Quam 
explained, are 20,000-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
With the burgeoning number of people willing to donate, however, Quam said the 
chances of someone like Kahl finding a match are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"The docs still call them miracle matches, but it is becoming more common," 
Quam said. "I can't give you percentages because our program is growing so 
rapidly now we just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
In Kahl's case, four possible American donors were found, but two have been 
ruled out. The other two have been tested, at a cost of $200 each, to see 
whether either one could provide an exact match for Kahl. Results are pending. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that many additional donors will need to be tested before a 
match is found. 
</P>
<P>
Kahl, who is bearing the cost of the tests, said he does not doubt that he will 
find a donor and that he will survive the risky operation to replace his own 
diseased marrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I'd made the decision, I got a warm feeling inside of me that said I 
should be doing this," Kahl said. "And once I beat this thing, I'm not going to 
stop telling people to get educated about this. If you don't (volunteer), there 
are a lot of people out there who won't live at all." 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the El Segundo students have had their share of run-ins with 
Kahl for transgressions ranging from playing hooky to breaking into cars, they 
say they plan to do everything they can to make sure Kahl survives. 
</P>
<P>
"I was heading down the wrong road and Kahl kept on me, but he didn't give up 
on me," said Ruben Hernandez, an 18-year-old varsity football player at El 
Segundo High School. "He kept telling me, 'Go to sports and get your aggression 
out in sports. Maybe you'll do something with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Hernandez discovered that he could play football well, Kahl made him a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me if I kept my grades good and I stayed eligible and made varsity 
that he would buy me my letterman's jacket," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager kept his part of the bargain, and Kahl gave him the $130 jacket 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Mr. Kahl, I'd probably have ended up as a statistic somewhere," 
Hernandez said. "My friends, sometimes they say he's hassling them, but I tell 
them, 'Hey, man, he's just doing his job and if you guys were smart enough not 
to get in trouble, you wouldn't have to deal with him.' 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a bad guy. He's a cop that cares."

REFLECTIONS: 'I THINK BEING ACTIVE AND CARING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE, THOSE ARE THE 
THINGS WHICH MAKE LIFE REAL AND IMPORTANT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. Jeanette Avent, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During her 69 years, Genevieve Engman has survived being thrown out of car in 
an accident, cancer surgery, a brain tumor and a stroke. Confined to a 
wheelchair since 1967, Gen, as she is know to friends, keeps pain at bay by 
keeping busy. In January, she launched "Clowning Around With Gen," a puppet 
show she created for spinal cord, stroke and trauma victims. She was 
interviewed by Times staff writer G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by Dave 
Gatley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The fact that I have been the whole route with spinal cord injuries and I'm in 
a wheelchair gives my message a special punch. I've had about 16 surgeries, a 
brain tumor, cancer, stroke -- you name it, I've been there. 
</P>
<P>
I did my first show in January for about 20 of the staff at the San Diego 
Rehabilitation Institute. I was still recovering from a recent setback, but 
everyone was so enthusiastic. Since then, I've done about 26 shows for patients 
and staff at several hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
I think being active and caring about other people, those are the things which 
make life real and important. I can't understand people who say they are so 
bored they don't know what to do with themselves. I don't have enough time in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
I decided last year I was going to do something for people in the hospital 
recuperating from spinal cord injuries, stroke and trauma. This is the route I 
had been over and over again so many times, so it was something I knew about. 
</P>
<P>
Before the show, I come out from behind my stage, which fits around my 
wheelchair, and tell them my personal story and introduce my show. Although my 
main interest has always been marionettes, this show I do with hand puppets. I 
have recorded the voices for the show, the sound effects, and I use music box 
music as a background. 
</P>
<P>
The story is about Bo Bo the clown. An oversized mallet representing "fate" 
hangs over his head even as he is telling the audience he is going to lead this 
long life. Then he looks up and down comes the mallet. When he comes back, he 
comes back up as Boo Hoo. He cries, "I'm not me anymore." In the end, he learns 
to smile again and comes back again as Bo Bo but in a different costume. For 
the patients, the analogy is very clear. Just like Bo Bo, they have been hit by 
the hand of fate. But, like Bo Bo, they can learn to smile again. The goal of 
my program is to help patients accomplish the miracle of healing through 
laughter, love and faith. 
</P>
<P>
When I first started, I would do the show and come back the following week for 
one-on-one with about four patients. Now I'm involved with all of the patients 
after the show. I wish I could do more because some of the responses have been 
just unbelievable. There is something about puppets that reaches into the 
innermost person. It's the spirit of childhood, the spirit of loving in the 
puppet. 
</P>
<P>
One of the patients, a 19-year-old who had been in a terrible motorcycle 
accident, hadn't made any coordinated responses since his accident. He watched 
the puppet show and he tried to clap. His mother started crying and the 
therapists were abuzz. It was his first coordinated movement. 
</P>
<P>
After the show, I work with the patients, giving them a hand puppet with 
interchangeable eyes, nose and mouth. I use all kinds of different textured 
materials for the features, such as a fuzzy nose to make it a tactile 
experience. It's important that they get the brain to recognize these different 
signals as fuzzy, slick, hard and smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Using puppets is such a totally unique approach for reaching these patients. I 
usually have eight to 10 in an audience, and last week I had a woman who sat 
through the show with her eyes closed. I was going to give her a hand puppet to 
hold, but her husband, who seemed very loving and caring, said she was brain 
damaged and she wouldn't be able to do anything with it. I just said let's try. 
I worked with her, fitting the puppet around her hand. She opened her eyes wide 
open and began trying to talk to me. She was very alert. Her husband didn't 
realize what he was doing. He was reinforcing her problems. I empathize with 
them, but I never commiserate, because that would be pulling them back down. 
The more she hears the negative, the more she's going to believe it. Nobody 
knows when they're going to die, but I think some people must die 20 or 30 
times in their life mentally because they're so negative. 
</P>
<P>
In the show, I stress the positive. We get so accustomed to negative thoughts 
that we get into a negative path. Life is like a mirror. It reflects the image 
we believe. Working with puppets gives patients another focus.

HOW TO BECOME A MARROW DONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost any healthy adult can register to become a bone marrow donor, according 
to Liz Quam, a spokeswoman for the National Marrow Donor Program based in St. 
Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Potential donors are sent to a local testing center where two tablespoons of 
blood are drawn to test four of six tissue factors. The results from the 
initial test are then entered into the center's national computer system for 
comparison to patients throughout North America and in some European nations. 
</P>
<P>
So far, private donations and some federal funding have borne the $50 cost of 
the initial tests, Quam said. 
</P>
<P>
If the volunteer's first four tissue factors match that of a patient -- a 
statistically rare event -- a program worker may visit the volunteer at home or 
at work to take another blood sample to match the final two factors. 
</P>
<P>
The $200 cost of the second test is borne by the patient. 
</P>
<P>
"If you match again, by that time, everybody starts to get excited," Quam said. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteer is given an extensive physical examination to assure that he or 
she is in perfect health before any final agreements are signed. 
</P>
<P>
Once an exact match involving a healthy donor has been found, the patient then 
undergoes chemotherapy to destroy his or her existing marrow. During the seven 
to 10 days that this process requires, Quam said, donors often feel a 
heightened sense of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman told me she felt like she was pregnant again, and that every time 
she crossed a street or drove a car she had to be extra careful because she was 
in charge of two lives," Quam said. 
</P>
<P>
The donor then is admitted to a hospital for an overnight stay. During the 
removal procedure, the donor is placed under general anesthesia and needles are 
inserted in the pelvic bone through the small of the back to draw the marrow. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure causes a bruised sensation that lasts about a week, Quam said. 
</P>
<P>
"Donors have said it's like falling on ice on your rear end," she said. "It's a 
Tylenol type of pain. . . . We've had donors who said they went jogging the 
next day."

STORM OF CONTROVERSY OVER PUBLIC FUNDING BLOWS ILL FOR ARTS; 
</P>
<P>
INSISTENCE THAT TAX DOLLARS SUPPORT ONLY CLEAN, WHOLESOME ARTWORKS IS BIGOTRY. 
THE COSTA MESA TEMPEST OVER 'SISTER MARY' EXEMPLIFIES THE INTOLERANCE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The arts in America are riding out a storm. Scientists have discovered that the 
mere beating of insect wings can affect global weather patterns; much in the 
same way the beating of a few conservative breasts in this country has given 
rise, over the past 18 months, to a hurricane of controversy concerning 
government funding of the arts. Now some of the wind seems to be blowing 
through the city of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
From one point of view, the storm is a tempest in a teapot. The proposed 
$175-million budget for the National Endowment for the Arts in fiscal 1991 
represents a minuscule portion of the national budget: It wouldn't absorb the 
smallest drop of the savings-and-loan red ink. The handful of change exacted 
from each taxpayer to fund the NEA for a year wouldn't buy a ballpark hot dog. 
Funding for the arts on a local level is similarly negligible in proportion to 
overall spending. 
</P>
<P>
Still, over the years public funding for the arts has played an important role 
in promoting the most innovative, adventurous new work -- the kind of work that 
can't survive without sponsorship -- as well as underwriting hundreds of 
community-oriented arts programs. Such funding has led the way in making ours 
the most culturally vibrant era in American history, enabling our arts to 
investigate, elevate and celebrate our national spirit. 
</P>
<P>
When I think about what an extraordinary return we taxpayers have gotten on our 
small investment in the arts, I'm astonished all over again at the storm that 
now threatens the principle of public arts funding in our own community and 
across America. 
</P>
<P>
It makes me wonder what motivates those who have mounted the attack. I'll go so 
far as to suggest that it's really a kind of bigotry. My dictionary defines 
bigot as a person who holds blindly to a particular creed or opinion; a 
narrow-minded, intolerant person. 
</P>
<P>
I don't doubt the sincerity of those who insist that certain works of art 
supported by government grants are offensive to their eyes. They make the 
mistake, however, of judging these works solely on the basis of subject matter, 
when art through the ages has amply demonstrated that any aspect of human 
experience can be appropriate subject matter for artistic exploration. (Oedipus 
Rex, for example, is about incest and patricide.) They compound the mistake by 
assuming that their interpretation of the subject matter is absolute. But these 
are errors of ignorance rather than malice. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, I also do not doubt the integrity and good sense of the arts 
experts who chose to bestow grants to those controversial artworks in the first 
place. Both points of view are valid. Art is different things to different 
people; as is beauty; as is even truth. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly why I suggest that those who insist on their definition of art 
as the only valid one are narrow-minded and intolerant. They are bigots. They 
cling tenaciously to their personal moral and religious creeds, attempting to 
impose them on everyone and to dismiss artistic considerations altogether. 
</P>
<P>
These bigots insist that our tax dollars should only support clean, wholesome, 
unthreatening works of art. They refuse to consider the idea that art, by its 
nature, ought to be provocative rather than placating; eye-opening rather than 
eye-soothing; not just an upholder but also a challenger of traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
America was founded in direct opposition to the religious bigotry that forced 
our Pilgrims out of Europe; it was founded in a spirit that refused to accept 
prevailing conventions. America's art needs to breathe that spirit and carry it 
forward and not have it suffocated by a new brand of religious bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, as the status of the arts at the national level seems to be 
improving slightly (under the notable leadership of that staunch conservative, 
Orrin G. Hatch), the City Council of Costa Mesa is jumping through hoops at the 
bark of a couple of self-appointed guardians of morality. Just how much of a 
storm these few breast-beaters will manage to kick up remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
For the record it should be noted that the latest object of their wrath, a play 
called "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," by Christopher Durang, 
has been performed to the intense amusement of audiences across the country, 
including a great many Catholics. Its spirit is unabashedly satirical, and its 
point of view about certain aspects of the Catholic educational system is 
clearly antagonistic. Durang himself went to Catholic schools, and looks back 
on the experience with extreme distaste; in his play he turns his remembered 
pain and anger into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
A key attribute of the American character is our ability to maintain a sense of 
humor about ourselves. But bigots are known for their lack of humor, and our 
local bigots apparently tremble for the reputation and well-being of the 
Catholic Church. They are clamoring to have the production of Durang's play 
closed, or at least to have its city funding withdrawn, in a blatant attempt to 
shut Durang up, to curtail his freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
No one should make the mistake of dismissing these extremists. There's a real 
danger that their effort to influence the City Council could succeed, unless 
more sensible citizens speak up. Those who value freedom of expression as one 
of America's priceless rights should take action to protect that freedom in our 
own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
I certainly hope that wiser, more tolerant minds will prevail; and that sooner 
rather than later, the storm that threatens the arts both locally and 
nationally will blow itself out.

Much media hype and political backslapping is taking place over the opening of 
the Thomas F. Riley Terminal at John Wayne Airport. Mr. Riley states: "This 
state-of-the-art facility will rank this airport along with the best in the 
world for the next 20 years." Well, a new terminal building does not a great 
airport make! 
</P>
<P>
At 5,700 feet, the primary runway is one of the shortest commercial runways in 
this country. The drastic power reductions required at 500 or 1,000 feet after 
breaking ground also make it one of the most dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
If the runway were extended to the San Diego Freeway with a blast fence, the 
noise abatement procedures might be able to be eliminated or modified to a 
safer degree. This would place the aircraft at a higher altitude above the 
homes in Santa Ana Heights and the Back Bay area and therefore quieter. 
</P>
<P>
To those who argue that a longer runway would mean larger aircraft, a displaced 
landing threshold could retain the existing landing distance. The county 
controls the size of the aircraft operating at the airport as it is. 
</P>
<P>
The new terminal is indeed a beautiful facility, but the crews and passengers 
will still be subjected to the same increased risks as before. After spending 
millions on the roadways, parking facilities and terminal, we see that the 
priorities of the politicians are comfort and convenience, not safety.

What an ingenious idea that the Orange County Board of Supervisors has come up 
with! It can solve the problem of overcrowding at John Wayne Airport, as well 
as having to locate a new airport site, merely by closing the Main Street 
parking lot and forcing everyone to use the airport parking structures at $14 
for each of the first two days and $7 for every day thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
The natural result is that a lot of people such as myself will revert to using 
LAX, leaving John Wayne for the businessmen and women, whose companies will 
reimburse them for their parking expense. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to add that I am an airline employee who can fly much more cheaply out 
of LAX, and have willingly paid extra money to utilize John Wayne, but I have 
been priced out of this market. 
</P>
<P>
I also have the feeling that after the 90-day "trial period," the remote lot 
will be quietly closed. How much will it cost to use the parking structure 
then? $15?

I must respond to Irvine council member Barry Hammond's remarks regarding 
prayer at Irvine City Council meetings ("Measures Fail After Debate on 
Religion," Sept. 13): "The issue is not whether we can offend anybody. It's 
what's the policy for the city that will offend the least number of people." 
</P>
<P>
What I cannot understand is why Hammond would even consider, much less vote 
for, a policy regarding prayer that would offend even one resident!

PLASTIC SURGEON SHOULD FACE TRUE JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeffrey L. Gunther, the presiding judge in Dr. Michael Elam's case, the 
controversial cosmetic surgeon, apparently needs more than mere cosmetic 
surgery. If his recent decision ("Doctor Who was Stripped of His License Gets 
Reprieve," Sept. 6) is any indication, he needs a full-fledged brain transplant 
as his thought processes and sense of logic seem to be severely impaired. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of concluding that Elam's medical license should be revoked, as the 
Medical Board of California had recommended due to numerous violations, 
including forged insurance billings, a botched "tummy tuck" and unwanted 
operations, Gunther gave him a mere slap on the wrist, which included requiring 
Elam to take an ethics class and to have his practice monitored until his case 
is resolved in court. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the deciding factor in the judge's ruling was around 75 letters 
submitted by doctors in support of Elam. Hmmm, just another example of the 
"good ol' boys" network, of doctors protecting their own. 
</P>
<P>
A more fitting punishment would have been to allow some of Elam's disgruntled 
clients to perform cosmetic surgery on him. As they say, an eye for an eye, a 
face for a face, a tummy for a tummy.

INDIGENT MEDICAL CARE AS A GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to a letter from Dr. Arthur Silk. Dr. Silk states the 
poor have no powerful citizens groups to lobby for them, "no Gray Panthers 
battling for the destitute." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Silk does not have his facts straight. 
</P>
<P>
The Gray Panthers, National Council of Senior Citizens, AARP and the Society to 
Protect Social Security and Preserve Medicare have been actively advocating a 
National Health Program that would provide access to all for years. 
</P>
<P>
On the local scene, the California Gray Panthers, California Congress of 
Seniors, the California Senior Legislature and the Senior Citizens Advisory 
Council of Orange County all actively advocated California SB 2668, which would 
have provided affordable health care to all Californians. They did not support 
SB 2505, written by the California Medical Assn., which had no cost controls 
and would have been administered by a board dominated by health-care providers, 
doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Further, he bashes Proposition 13 for causing the crisis. Orange County spends 
less per capita for health care for the needy than any other county in the 
state.

'REGRESSIVE POLITICS IN A PROGRESSIVE CITY' -- IRVINE'S JUST RESPONDING TO ITS 
CITIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I believe that all sides have a right to be heard. The Times (editorial, 
"Regressive Politics in a Progressive City," Sept. 16) apparently believes only 
certain sides have those rights. 
</P>
<P>
You say our City Council wasted four hours debating Christmas tress and a 
proposal for an invocation. You ask, "When does the healing begin?" Do you mean 
to ask, "When will we silence those who hold opinions different from yours?" 
</P>
<P>
No member of the current council placed those items on the agenda. This council 
simply responded to Irvine residents requesting their legal opportunity to 
propose something to their City Council. In the past, residents of Irvine 
wanted to discuss the issues of a Christmas tree and an invocation, but were 
silenced by Mayor Larry Agran. We listened to four hours of testimony from both 
sides, including confronting, angry and insulting tirades from those claiming 
to be "sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
How should our council act in order to comply with the ideals The Times might 
find acceptable? Should we listen only to one side of an issue? Should we 
refuse to place certain items on our agenda? How should we select those sides 
and items? Should we form an Issues Selection Committee of those 
"extra-sensitive people" who speak only in the most melodramatic, excessive and 
hostile expletives? Would that begin the healing? 
</P>
<P>
The Times deplores the fact that Mary Ann Gaido is not seated, in spite of 
petitions to hold an election. The Times laments that we appealed Judge Eileen 
Moore's decision. Does The Times prefer to ignore more than 4,000 people who 
signed a petition asking for an election. Do you prefer appointed, instead of 
elected, officials? 
</P>
<P>
As you know, I had no objection to seating Ms. Gaido. I also have no objection 
to completing the process of making certain that if the people prefer to elect, 
that they may have an election. 
</P>
<P>
When I talk about healing, I mean that every point of view in this community 
will have access to local government. I mean that every opinion will have an 
equal opportunity to be heard. The limitation on time for speakers is not 
intended to limit speech. It is intended to provide an equal opportunity for 
everyone to speak. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, opinions do not become unacceptable because a few people 
decide they are unacceptable. Someone who simply claims to be more sensitive is 
not given special rights or opportunities. The intolerance of the 
self-proclaimed, progressive elite is alarming. Fascism is always frightening. 
</P>
<P>
Please don't overestimate the motives of those who screech loudest about 
freedom of speech and religion in Irvine. When we think about healing, we 
should also consider that there are those who will refuse the healing process 
because they have their own political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
I hope you will consider that those who spoke most passionately against the 
Christmas tree were also the leadership core of Larry Agran's political 
campaign. They just lost a close election and want to set the stage to win the 
next. They have a politically motivated agenda, and they have a right to it. 
They do not have the right to possess the only legitimate opinions in our 
community.

GEIGER HEADS TO MARYLAND FOR THE CHALLENGE

<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PALO ALTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The campus drives are lined with palm trees and eucalyptuses. There is a lake 
on the backside of the campus, and a boathouse. More days than not the sky is a 
deep, seductive blue, the temperature in the 60s and 70s. San Francisco is 30 
minutes north. San Jose is 20 minutes south, past Santa Clara and heading 
straight toward the mountains. The student body here at Stanford University is 
one of the most carefully selected anywhere. Their jocks are actually students 
and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Of the private institutions that are committed to big-time athletics, only Duke 
plays at Stanford's level. No fewer than 10 of Stanford's teams started this 
school year with a legitimate chance of winning a national title, including 
men's and women's volleyball, men's and women's tennis, baseball and women's 
basketball. Last year seven of Stanford's teams finished either first, second 
or third nationally, including women's basketball, which won the national 
title. John Elway, John McEnroe and Jennifer Azzi, player of the year in 
women's basketball, have all walked the yard here. 
</P>
<P>
Okay, tuition, room and board ($20,700 this year) make the athletic department 
difficult to fund, and Stanford's own band occasionally contributes to the loss 
of a big football game. But if what you do for a living is oversee college 
athletics, Stanford, all things considered, is the job. Andy Geiger has had 
that job for 11 years. So we have, really, only one question for Mr. Geiger: 
</P>
<P>
How in the world can you possibly justify leaving all this to take the same job 
at the University of Maryland? 
</P>
<P>
From all indications, Geiger was not an easy man to work for; some members of 
the Stanford staff found him difficult. But he is good at what he does and he 
could have remained in his job at Stanford indefinitely. This isn't the first 
time he has been asked, "You're leaving here to go where?" 
</P>
<P>
When Maryland first asked him to become more than a consultant in its search 
for an athletic director to replace Lew Perkins, Geiger called an alumna who is 
very active on the Stanford athletic board. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'I want you to know before you read it in the newspapers that I 
think I'm going to take the job at Maryland.' " 
</P>
<P>
The alum chuckled. Nice joke, what do you want? 
</P>
<P>
Geiger recalled saying: "No, I'm really serious, I'm really going to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the summer, probably when Perkins resigned, Geiger thought to 
himself, "Boy, can you imagine anyone going into that Maryland situation? It's 
a monster." 
</P>
<P>
The other day, as he sat in his office pondering the question one more time, he 
admitted: "There are going to be days when I say to myself, 'What the hell did 
you do? You had it all. What are doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
What he is doing is going to a school whose athletic department has been in a 
free fall for four years; a school whose basketball team will produce no 
television revenue for one season, no NCAA tournament revenue for two seasons; 
an athletic department that is thinking about survival, not national 
championships in most sports; an athletic department still digging itself from 
underneath the rubble caused by the June 19, 1986, earthquake that was Len 
Bias's death and subsequent three-year NCAA probation. 
</P>
<P>
Geiger will tell you that going east is going home. He attended Syracuse and 
was AD at Penn. His wife lived in the District of Columbia when they met. Her 
mother is in a retirement home in Alexandria, Va. Personal economics are 
involved. But more than anything, Geiger chose College Park because Maryland's 
athletic department is in trouble and Stanford's isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford is just an extraordinary place," he said, sounding very wistful. 
"There's not a single sour note in the music. But I've been restless for the 
last year. For the last six months I've been thinking, 'What am I going to do 
next?' A lot of people who know me have said Maryland is the perfect place for 
me right now, in that I'm a builder. I have a sense of direction and I think I 
have some leadership ability. And those that have observed Maryland think 
that's what Maryland needs right now." 
</P>
<P>
What he is saying without saying it is Stanford doesn't need him. Sure, the 
football team struggles. But no AD in the world is going to cure that by 
himself. At least immediately, football losses are going to be the least of 
Geiger's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The Maryland job," he said, "is absolutely perfect for me. I really love 
intercollegiate athletics and that vision needs to be expressed at Maryland. I 
need to bring the athletic department out of the defensive shell it's been in 
and get it open and aggressive and collegial and accomplishing things. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they feel like they're under siege. They've been forced into a 
position on managing that, rather than managing programs. I have to get them to 
the point of saying, 'Let's go, let's get on with it.' I'm not going to wallow 
in recent history. Let's list what we have, what's wonderful about this place 
and go." 
</P>
<P>
He was part of a team of consultants the University of Maryland called upon in 
1986, and he was called again after Perkins left, to help develop a profile of 
what an athletic department should be. He isn't going into this naively. 
</P>
<P>
Another question to be asked is, how fortunate is Maryland, considering its 
circumstances, to get an AD this accomplished, one at the very top of his 
profession? Geiger, as it turns out, wants and needs Maryland almost as 
desperately as the school wants and needs him. Geiger has stopped talking about 
his reasons for leaving. "I prefer to call them my reasons for arriving," he 
said. "I can't wait to get there."

The subject for today: What does golf have in common with a bullfight or a 
flamenco dance on a table top by someone with castanets and a comb in their 
hair? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is often best performed by people with Spanish surnames or Latino 
backgrounds.

<P>
Question No. 2: Who is -- or was -- the best of these modern-day conquistadors 
of the links? 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros, you think? Hah! A Masters or two. Three British Opens, a 
Swiss Open here and there. But no record whatsoever in the heartland -- Texas 
in the summer, Florida in the spring, California in the winter. Places where 
the competition is the fiercest and the greens the swiftest. Besides, what's he 
won over here -- four tournaments?

You fancy Roberto De Vicenzo, the golfing gaucho from the Pampas? Uh-uh. He won 
only one tournament in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez? Well, Cheech could play. Cheech came out of Puerto Rico and 
hit the ball farther than anyone weighing 110 pounds ever had before. He won 
his share of tourneys, eight of them, on the PGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
But, no. The greatest of these players we have in mind is definitely a mainland 
Norteamericano, one of those super Mexican-Americans who seem born to play the 
game and do it with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino? You're getting warm. The Merry Mex has won 27 tournaments, to say 
nothing of two British Opens to go with his two U.S. Opens and two PGAs, not to 
mention a lot of high-stake games that never got in the record book. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gamez? Well, the kid has been on the tour less than a year and already 
has won twice. Only a budding Jack Nicklaus does that. 
</P>
<P>
These are all candidates, to be sure. But give me the player with the Spanish 
surname who can do things on the golf course that these guys never dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
Let me ask you this: You think Seve or Trevino could go out and shoot 64 with 
morning sickness? You think Robert Gamez could make a two on the 18th hole if 
he were pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
Some players complain of coming back to try to play golf after a touch of the 
flu or a migraine. How about coming back after a miscarriage? 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen -- a little "Virgin of the Maccarena" music, professor! -- 
I give you the greatest player of all these candidates! Adios muchachos! It's 
not a senor, it's a senora. It's Miz Nancy Lopez, no less! 
</P>
<P>
No one in that Spanish armada ever played the game any better. Forget Jose 
Marie Olazabal. Skip the Dutra brothers. 
</P>
<P>
No one, Spanish-surnamed or as Anglo-Saxon as Harry Vardon, ever hit a golf 
ball with any more authority and precision than Nancy Lopez. Men might have hit 
it farther, but not straighter. 
</P>
<P>
No one has meant more to her sport. Arnold Palmer is generally credited with 
making men's golf major league again. He put the sport on network television. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Lopez did the same for women's. When she came out on tour, Babe Didrikson 
was long gone. Mickey Wright was going. Patty Berg was just a picture on the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
The game needed a star -- and Nancy Lopez was it. She won 42 tournaments with a 
smile on her lips -- and usually a baby in a pram in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Warm, friendly, given to giggling a lot, she gave her sport an image P.R. types 
only dreamed about. You couldn't have invented a more nearly perfect heroine. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever saw Nancy Lopez in a foul mood, mad, uncooperative. She was as 
sunny as Sonora in the summer, as cheerful as a sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
And could she play! She was winning state tournaments when she was 12 in New 
Mexico. She was the first girl ever to play in the Crosby and she won nine 
tournaments her first full year as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
Great artists, and she was one, are usually as temperamental as opera stars. 
Lopez was always as polite as a guy selling brushes. She never hid in the 
shower after a bad round, never threw her clubs into a creek or into the trunk 
of her car as she sped out of town in a cloud of curses after losing a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
It boggles the mind to think what Nancy Lopez could have won had she gone at 
golf with the singleness of purpose most other stars bring to it. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez once said of Jack Nicklaus, "He became a legend in his spare 
time." But as author Bob Drum said of Lopez, "She had to win tournaments while 
the kids were taking a nap." 
</P>
<P>
She posted her 42 tournament victories between maternity leaves. After one win, 
someone asked her what her chief goal in golf was. Nancy answered "To have a 
boy next time." (She has two girls, Ashley, 6, and Erin, 4.) 
</P>
<P>
She has earned almost $3 million on the golf tour, but you get the impression 
she would be just as happy -- and just as cheerful -- working as a receptionist 
in a dentist's office. 
</P>
<P>
She is, so far as I know, the only mother in any golf hall of fame. Golf 
probably needs her more than she does it. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when a journalist asked Tommy Bolt if he didn't think Arnold Palmer had 
done a lot for golf, Terrible Tommy retorted, "Don't you think golf has done a 
lot for Arnold Palmer?" 
</P>
<P>
In Lopez's case, it's not so clear-cut. When she showed up for the MBS LPGA 
tournament being played this weekend at Los Coyotes Country Club in Buena Park, 
the sponsors were weak with relief. Patty Sheehan, the most recent winner on 
the tour (Seattle, last week) had served notice that she was not going to play. 
So had Beth Daniel, the season's leading money winner. But when Lopez said she 
would be there, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some said Lopez had lost her desire. She was coming off a month-long 
layoff. She had not won in a year. She had even missed a cut this year, in the 
Dinah Shore. 
</P>
<P>
So, Nancy went out and shot 69-70 the first two rounds, moving solidly into the 
hunt. She's still the best golfer ever whose name ended in a Z. Or who had to 
burp the baby on the way to the first tee.

PRO FOOTBALL: DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR REKINDLES AN OLD RIVALRY WHEN HIS SQUAD

<P>
If you were from Struthers, just outside Youngstown, Ohio, you didn't take to 
the folks from neighboring Boardman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking the Hatfields and the McCoys here," said Jim Fox, a Boardman 
High School teacher. "The kids from Struthers always had something to prove to 
the rich kids from Boardman." 
</P>
<P>
"Boardman had a better band, better shopping malls, better everything than 
Struthers," said Chuck Perazich, sports editor of the Youngstown Vindicator. 
"Except for sports -- when it came to sports, you never knew who was going to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"In sports it was the cake-eaters from Boardman, against the blue-collar tough 
guys from Struthers. Bitter rivals," Perazich said. "That's why I imagine 
(Chargers' defensive coordinator) Ronnie Lynn has got to have a funny feeling 
about this game. I got to believe he's going to try a little harder. After all, 
he's from Struthers." 
</P>
<P>
And Bernie Kosar is from Boardman. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar also is the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns (1-1), and 
today in front of a sellout crowd of 80,000 he will match brawn and wits with 
Lynn's not-so-neighborly Charger defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known the guy for a long time," Lynn said. "His high school adviser (Fox) 
was my college roommate. I even tried to recruit Bernie to play at Cal." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar went on to prosper for the University of Miami, but today Lynn will be 
coming after him again. And he won't be alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie knows he's going to get the good pass rush, maybe the great pass rush," 
Cleveland coach Bud Carson said. "Maybe the best in the AFC." 
</P>
<P>
This cannot be good news for Kosar. In two games, he has been sacked 10 times; 
on 10 other occasions, he has released the ball and then has been decked. Four 
of his passes have been deflected by pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
He wears an elastic wrap around a painted black plastic cup used to protect the 
elbow on his throwing arm, Maybe he should be padded from head to foot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a tough guy," linebacker Gary Plummer said. "As much as he's 
been knocked around in the last two weeks to still be standing -- you got to 
admire the guy." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, however, do not come to Cleveland Stadium to praise Kosar. They 
come "to bury him," as defensive tackle Lee Williams pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the target," Williams said. "We know where he's going to be, and we're 
coming after him. Full throttle." 
</P>
<P>
Protected by an offensive line that doesn't make the Chargers' offensive line 
look so bad anymore, Kosar has struggled to be effective, and as a result, 
Cleveland's offense ranks 26th in the NFL. The Browns feature four new starters 
up front, and to hear the folks in Cleveland, they'd be just as happy to go to 
war with the four old starters. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Browns seven quarters of play to record their first offensive 
touchdown this season. They now have two. Their longest run from scrimmage has 
been 16 yards by Kevin Mack, who is now sidelined with a broken finger; their 
longest pass play is 27 yards, to Reggie Langhorne. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had their problems, and they may do some things to keep extra 
protectors in there for Bernie," Lynn said. "But we're going to rush him. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie's a courageous guy. But he may throw some away, and if you get hit a 
number of times, I don't care how tough you are, you start to hurt and flinch. 
I can see some of that happening if we do what we're capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Now if the Browns are capable of doing what they do best, then nobody scores, 
and these two teams go into overtime for the third time in their last five 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Chargers, the Browns try to construct a victory via defense. Their 
head coach is a former defensive coordinator, who was the architect of 
Pittsburgh's "Steel Curtain." Their big-play linebacker, Clay Matthews, has 
been to five Pro Bowls. Their top pass rusher, Michael Dean Perry, leads the 
AFC in sacks, with four. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, they have yet to surrender a second-half touchdown, and as the 
Chargers are often reminded, they have yet to score in either the third or 
fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. I know," quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said. "I'm sure they've got to 
feel pretty good about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're looking to change that. Not necessarily to score in the fourth 
quarter, but to score if we need to score. That's our goal." 
</P>
<P>
Bring on Fuad Reveiz. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the blindfold?" said the Charger kicker, whose job is on the line. 
"Coach (Dan) Henning hasn't made it easy for me putting me on the spot like 
this, but it's something that is part of the business." 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz, one-for-three in field-goal attempts, has been informed that future 
employment with the Chargers rests solely on how he does today. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be panicking after two games," Reveiz said. "You've got a lot of the 
season to go, and you can't be looking after two games and think it's the end 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but an 0-3 start would be the first for the Chargers since going 
0-11 in 1975. It would also put an end to all those high-flying expectations 
that greeted a fifth-place schedule and Bobby Beathard's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The last time, however, the Chargers sought victory in the Browns' ramshackle 
backyard, they were waylaid, 47-17. 
</P>
<P>
"We got no allies there," Lynn said. "We're gonna be warming up in front of the 
'Dawg Pound' (the dog bone-tossing section of Browns fans), and they'll be 
throwing things at us and calling us everything but free men. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an avid fan, a rabid fan. This is important to the people in Cleveland. 
These are the guys who come out of the mills wearing hard hats who just don't 
take them off Friday till Sunday. They live for their football. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I got a ticket for my college roommate," Lynn said, "and he's rooting 
for Bernie."

GATE TOPS '73 RECORD AS LOPEZ BEATS PAEZ;

<P>
PRO BOXING: RECEIPTS TOTAL $601,000 FOR JUNIOR-LIGHTWEIGHT FIGHT AT ARCO ARENA. 
CHAMPION WINS BY UNANIMOUS DECISION.

<TEXT>
<P>
On an afternoon when the cash register didn't stop dinging until it hit a 
California boxing record $601,000, workmanlike Tony Lopez successfully turned 
back a challenge to his junior-lightweight championship by Mexico's Jorge Paez. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, who won a unanimous decision Saturday before 15,008 at Arco Arena, 
didn't attract the biggest crowd to see a California fight, but the gate broke 
the record of $476,000 Muhammad Ali and Ken Norton have held since their second 
fight in 1973, at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Paez, the International Boxing Federation featherweight champion, was trying to 
add Lopez's IBF junior-lightweight championship. He failed, he said later, 
because he fought a better man. "He's better than me this day," he said, with 
his manager, Nacho Huizar, interpreting. "I wanted to fight him, but I couldn't 
catch him. But I thought it was close, I thought the judges' scores showed the 
noise of the crowd, not what happened in the ring." 
</P>
<P>
All three judges had Lopez winning comfortably and by the same score, 117-111. 
The Times card favored Lopez, 116-112. 
</P>
<P>
By fighting a careful, low-risk fight, Lopez (36-2-1) positioned himself for a 
seven-digit payday with the undisputed lightweight champion, Pernell Whitaker. 
There is some disagreement in the Lopez camp, however, on whether this popular 
Sacramento fighter should take that fight. His trainer, Will Edgington, 
suggests a road toward easier money. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this business about 45 years and I say the toughest fighter in 
the world to beat is a fast-moving southpaw, and that's Whitaker," he said. 
"They (Lopez and his father/manager, Sal Lopez) may disagree with me, but they 
know how I'm going to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three fights out there for Tony now that would earn him a total of 
$1.5 million, all less risky than fighting Whitaker. I'd like to see him fight 
Brian Mitchell (from South Africa) and take his WBA junior-lightweight 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez wouldn't commit himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I want right now is a vacation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez dominated Paez (35-3-3) with his left jab in his best rounds and simply 
eluded the charging Paez in the others. At 5 feet 7, Lopez does not have a 
reach advantage, but he jabs effectively. 
</P>
<P>
He did it to near perfection Saturday, particularly in the early rounds when he 
put Paez further and further behind on the scorecards. All three judges had 
Lopez winning at least eight of the first nine rounds. Larry Rozadilla gave 
Lopez the first nine rounds, Paez the last three. 
</P>
<P>
Paez was greeted by boos when he entered the ring with a shaved, sunburst-style 
haircut and trunks bearing swirling fringes in Mexico's green-red-white colors. 
Paez, who has worked as an acrobat and clown in his parents' Mexicali circus, 
gestured to the crowd to produce even louder derision. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, who weighed 130 pounds to Paez's 129 3/4, began hitting the Paez early 
in Round 1 and didn't let up until Round 6, which Lopez took off to catch his 
wind. Early on, Paez came in on Lopez from a low crouch, firing hooks to the 
body and uppercuts to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was under control, fighting comfortably within himself and throughout 
showed superb defensive work. He was never hurt until the 10th, when Paez 
rocked him with a wild left hook to the head. That shot would be Paez's best 
punch of the fight, yet only for a second did Lopez wobble. 
</P>
<P>
Paez suffered his first loss in 30 bouts dating to 1986 because he couldn't 
hurt Lopez, who said he knew that would be the case. A fighter who is certain 
he will not be knocked out often can dictate pace and action, is comfortable at 
risk-taking and all the psychological advantage that implies. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't feel I was going to get hit hard enough to get knocked out," 
Lopez said, repeating what he said often in the week before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, I listened to my cornerman (Edgington). I did everything he told me to 
do, even stuff I didn't think would work. In the late rounds (all three judges 
had Paez winning at least two of the last three rounds), Will told me to 
jab-jab-jab and move, not to slug it out. We assumed we were ahead on points 
then." 
</P>
<P>
Paez was gracious in defeat, but still the clown. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he hurt me once with a punch to the head, but it was when I was looking 
at three girls," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prepared 100%, it was a good fight . . . and everyone goes home happy 
but me." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, on by far his biggest payday, earned $250,000, plus 35% of the gross 
over $500,000, or about another $36,000. Paez made $135,000. The crowd, which 
fell about 2,000 seats short of a sellout, paid $27 to $100 to see Lopez defend 
his title for the sixth time. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Edgington praised Paez. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched most of his fights, I had a good idea of what he could do, but 
Paez showed me a lot today with his endurance and his courage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, featherweight Rafael Ruelas (21-1) of Arleta had difficulty 
with journeyman Felipe De Jesus (28-7) of Mexico until Ruelas stopped him in 
the seventh round.

COOK RECOVERS AGAINST GIANTS; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: AFTER STRUGGLING THROUGH TWO RELIEF PERFORMANCES WITH HIS NEW CLUB, HE 
SETTLES IN WELL AS A STARTER, BEATING SOME OLD FRIENDS.

Dennis Cook's fastball was far better than his memory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
By moving his fastball in and out of the strike zone effectively, Cook baffled 
the Giants for 6 1/3 innings, his longest outing in months. "It's been a while, 
that's for sure," said Cook, who was acquired from the Phillies on Sept. 13 in 
exchange for catcher Darrin Fletcher. "I had one start against Pittsburgh when 
I went 6 1/3. I guess it was maybe in July -- no, June. I think." 
</P>
<P>
Cook made his first start as a Dodger a memorable one, giving up one run and 
striking out four in a 6-3 victory over the Giants at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Cook (9-3) retired 13 consecutive batters after he gave up a one-out single to 
Greg Litton in the first inning, pitching with poise and polish in a game that 
was scoreless until the Dodgers got five runs in the sixth inning -- a flurry 
that began with Cook's opposite-field single to left. 
</P>
<P>
"I just swing the bat and hope it hits the ball," Cook said. "I'm no hitter." 
</P>
<P>
His pitching drew praise from Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, who considered the 
entire evening a fine present for his 63rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"He did an outstanding job," Lasorda said of the 27-year-old left-hander. "When 
we got him, I wanted to look at him a little bit in relief. But looking at him, 
I thought he'd be a better starter than relief pitcher, and that's why he 
started." 
</P>
<P>
Cook started horrendously with the Dodgers on Sept. 16, giving up a sacrifice 
fly and a two-run home run to the first two batters he faced in a 9-5 loss at 
Cincinnati. He was charged with two earned runs in two-thirds of an inning and 
pitched only one-third of an inning in his next appearance the next day in 
Atlanta, leaving him an earned-run average of 18.00 as a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken me awhile to settle in, but I can settle real easy," Cook said. 
"And it's always a lot easier when you have runs scored for you." 
</P>
<P>
He had no runs to work with until the sixth, but if he felt the tension of a 
scoreless game and a pennant race, he showed no signs of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Every game's a pressure game when you're in the big leagues, the way I see 
it," said Cook, who began his career with the Giants and was traded to 
Philadelphia in June, 1989. "You don't win, you don't have a job -- here or 
anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
He did his job admirably Saturday, finally giving in to fatigue in the seventh 
inning. He was relieved by Tim Crews after he yielded a home run to Matt 
Williams and a single to Kevin Bass, and he left the field to a standing 
ovation from the sellout crowd of 45,755. 
</P>
<P>
"He had good command of his fastball all night. He changed speeds well and 
threw strikes, which is encouraging," catcher Mike Scioscia said. "He was ahead 
of most of the hitters, and I thought he did a terrific job shutting down a 
good lineup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I had an idea of his pitches as far as pitch selection, but it was a learning 
process to see what he could do in certain situations. You have to learn as 
much as you can in the early innings and see what's working and make 
adjustments. We were pretty much in sync. A couple of times he had a feel for a 
pitch and went with it. I thought it was just a tremendous effort for him." 
</P>
<P>
Cook downplayed his accomplishments and said he took no special glee in 
defeating his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no more satisfying that any other game," he said. "I wanted to throw 
the ball well and get ahead in the count, and if I could do that, I felt I 
could keep the team in the game. . . . It was no different than beating the 
Cincinnati Reds. It doesn't matter who I face and whether I start or relieve. 
As long as I have my name on my back, it doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
How well he pitches in the final days of the season could matter this winter, 
when Fernando Valenzuela can leave for free agency, which could leave Cook as 
the lone left-hander in the starting rotation. That's something he hasn't 
considered and won't think about for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"That's too far off. I've got to figure out what I'm doing two days from now," 
he said. "I liked it in Philadelphia -- there were a lot of good people over 
there and the organization was turning around. But this is a good organization, 
too, and I'm sure I'll enjoy myself here in L.A., starting or relieving, 
whatever they want me to do."

The Padres, after being turned down by general managers Andy MacPhail of the 
Minnesota Twins and Dave Dombroski of the Montreal Expos, have interviewed five 
candidates for their vacant vice president/baseball operations position, 
sources said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates, according to sources within and outside the Padre organization, 
are: Walt Jocketty, director of baseball administration of the Oakland 
Athletics; Bob Gebhard, vice president/player personnel of the Minnesota Twins; 
Dan Duquette, assistant general manager of the Montreal Expos; Gordon Ash, 
assistant general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays; and Roger Jongewaard, vice 
president/scouting and player development of the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
It is unknown whether the Padres have completed the first round of their 
interviewing process or still plan to talk with such executives as Larry Himes, 
formerly of the Chicago White Sox, and Ralph Nelson, vice president/assistant 
general manager of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Tal Smith, who's helping the Padre ownership conduct the search, was at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Saturday night and refused to comment on the 
candidate search. BOB NIGHTENGALE

THE CHICAGO STORY TO HAVE A NEW AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the final hours of Comiskey Park, before baseball is replaced by the 
wrecking ball, the Chicago White Sox continue to work on a new foundation for 
their new home. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of their 92 losses and seventh-place finish last year, the 
White Sox entered this next-to-last weekend of the regular season with the 
second-best record in baseball -- and the second-best in the American League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Were they in any other division except the one dominated by the Oakland 
Athletics, the White Sox might be about to celebrate their remarkable reversal 
with a shower of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
"From an overall perspective, we have to be pleased with the tremendous strides 
we've made," Manager Jeff Torborg said. "I'm proud of that, but it's 
frustrating we couldn't have done more. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to forget who finished second, though I don't think we will." 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago comeback is one of the most unusual stories of an unusual season, 
but it took on added dimension last week when co-owner Jerry Reinsdorf and 
general manager Larry Himes agreed that Himes, the architect of the White Sox 
renaissance, would not be moving with the team to the new stadium across 35th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Agreed? 
</P>
<P>
A nice way to say that Himes, the former Angel scouting director who may 
replace Jack McKeon as the San Diego Padres' general manager, was forced out by 
Reinsdorf. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Reinsdorf said only that Himes had done a fine job taking the White Sox 
from point C to point B but didn't think he was the man to take them to point 
A. Beyond that, there was no clear explanation, only speculation, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reinsdorf was displeased by Himes' refusal to mortgage some of the White 
Sox future in a stretch trade for Houston Astros pitcher Mike Scott and 
displeased again that Himes didn't claim Harold Baines and Willie McGee, 
preventing them from joining the A's. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although Himes had not publicly questioned the approach of batting 
instructor Walt Hrniak, who is operating on a five year-contract as one of 
Reinsdorf's personal favorites, some of his organizational people were unhappy 
about the appointment of Hrniak clones at each minor league level, and the 
negative groundswell was interpreted as coming from Himes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There was also the simple matter of a personality clash compounded by 
Reinsdorf's reported feeling that Himes was privately taking too much credit 
for the White Sox's success, at the expense of Torborg and the players. 
</P>
<P>
Himes is likely to receive the executive-of-the-year award for his work with a 
club that fired him. 
</P>
<P>
In unraveling the mess he inherited from Ken Harrelson in 1986, Himes ferreted 
out Harrelson's minor league cronies and rebuilt the scouting system to the 
point that all four of his No. 1 draft choices have contributed to the 1990 
success. They are Pitcher Jack McDowell (1987), third baseman Robin Ventura 
(1988), first baseman Frank Thomas (1989) and pitcher Alex Fernandez (1990). 
</P>
<P>
Himes also orchestrated trades for starting pitchers Greg Hibbard, Eric King 
and Melido Perez, relievers Barry Jones and Ken Patterson, second baseman Scott 
Fletcher and outfielders Sammy Sosa, Dan Pasqua, Lance Johnson and Phil 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Not one traded player has come back to haunt the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the end of the 1986 season and what was going on, and you look at 
where that club is today, the difference is day and night," Himes said. "I'm 
happy with my contribution. Continuity of management is a key to success. 
Change is always a setback." 
</P>
<P>
Torborg, who was hired by Himes and received a contract extension on the day 
Himes was dismissed, applauded the job Himes has done but added: "I have my own 
job to do, and I can't let it affect me. Those are administrative decisions 
that happen frequently in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox have a chance to reverse their 69-92 record of last year, and 
Torborg disputes the cynical contention that it's a fluke, the result of a few 
players having their best years. Torborg said he would like to know who those 
few are. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby Thigpen (with a major league-record 51 saves) is having a sensational 
season, but you look at the stats and wonder how we're within 25 games of 
Oakland, let alone nine or 10," Torborg said. "You look at the top 10 and you 
don't find any of our people. We have a lot of guys playing team baseball and 
maturing on the job, a lot of guys who figure to get better. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sit here and dream about being in another division, but that's not the 
way it is. We have to keep improving, and we're a long way from being an 
outstanding club on the level of the A's. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we're the youngest club in baseball. We have a lot of guys 
who've never played September before, but they haven't backed down. Every time 
they've been counted out, they come back. We've played Oakland tough. We 
haven't been intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox are the only team to win a season series from the A's, going 8-5 
overall and 5-1 in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
With a little help, they might have been second to none. As pitcher McDowell 
noted, "We played the A's well, but nobody else did." 
</P>
<P>
It has been rumored that A's Manager Tony LaRussa will return to Chicago as 
general manager, but LaRussa emphatically denies it. Joe Nossek, who has served 
the White Sox as a scout, eye in the sky and minor league manager, is expected 
to become personnel director, with Dan Evans continuing to handle paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
Winning isn't necessarily a healthy habit with the White Sox. The last time 
Chicago finished above .500 -- 85-77 -- was in 1985, and then-general manager 
Roland Hemond, who also was in charge when the White Sox won 99 games and a 
division title in 1983, was rewarded by being fired. Hemond now runs the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Clemens rejoins the Boston Red Sox rotation today, pitching against the 
New York Yankees. His shoulder is said to be healthy, but his team's back 
appears to be bent by the heavy burden of history, the ghosts of Septembers 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox led the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East by six games 
on Sept. 4. They entered the weekend series against the Yankees trailing the 
Blue Jays by a game. Since the start of division play in 1969, only one team 
has blown a late lead as large as six games -- the 1978 Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
In addition: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Red Sox have not won a World Series since 1918 and have appeared in 
four since, losing each in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They have finished second during the regular season 14 times, six times by 
a combined seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Joe Morgan said he does indeed feel haunted -- by an absence of 
consistent hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team is the same all the time," Morgan said. "When we hit, we win. When we 
don't hit, we don't win. It's so cut and dried it's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is such that the Red Sox need a lot of hits to win. They are short 
of power and speed. Only the Kansas City Royals have fewer home runs than 
Boston, which had 95 through Thursday and only four in the past 16 games. As 
usual, the Red Sox are last in the league in stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
They move one base at a time, which is why they are 48-21 when they get at 
least 10 hits a game but 33-48 when they don't. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Red Sox lead the league in hitting, they are in the middle of the 
pack in runs and have been shut out 16 times, the most in the majors. Entering 
the Yankee series, the most important hitters in the middle of the Boston 
lineup -- Mike Greenwell, who was five for 24, and Ellis Burks, who was three 
for 25 -- have been the coldest, too. 
</P>
<P>
And inevitably, patience is wearing thin. After a loss in Baltimore recently, 
Red Sox catcher Tony Pena hurled chairs around the clubhouse and called his 
team "a bunch of quitters," which angered teammates, particularly Greenwell, 
who said Pena owed an apology that he has not yet given. As one Red Sox 
observer noted, Pena appropriately threw folding chairs.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
INDIANS BEAT BLUE JAYS FOR 6TH WIN IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sometimes it seems nobody is good enough to win the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it appeared the Toronto Blue Jays were going to take command, they 
went into another slump. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Maldonado and Chris James hit consecutive home runs in the sixth inning 
Saturday at Toronto to lead the Cleveland Indians to a 5-2 victory over the 
Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Their second win in a row over the Blue Jays ran the Indians' winning streak to 
six games and kept the Blue Jays from breaking their tie with the Boston Red 
Sox for first place. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 games remaining, both have 82-70 records. The Red Sox seem to have the 
better schedule, playing eight at home, while the Blue Jays play nine on the 
road. Today, the Blue Jays will play their last home game of the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto's Kelly Gruber says he's tired of hearing the whispers that the Blue 
Jays will find a way to lose the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
"We came back from 6 1/2 games, and people are saying we're choking," said the 
third baseman after hitting his 29th home run. "I'm not concerned. We're 
talented and we'll win some games." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays spent the day missing opportunities to score off Jeff Shaw (3-4). 
</P>
<P>
They had 12 hits in 6 2/3 innings, but scored only two runs. Their last hope 
ended when Doug Jones came in to strike out two of the three batters he faced 
to register his 40th save. Jones has five saves since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Boston 2 -- They waited five hours in New York for the rain to stop 
and for most of the evening it appeared a good thing for the Red Sox that the 
game was played. 
</P>
<P>
But, after getting six strong innings from Mike Boddicker and taking a 2-1 
lead, the Red Sox bullpen faltered and the Yankees ended their seven-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Although he seemed bothered by the muddy mound and walked five batters and made 
two wild pitches, Boddicker, seeking his sixth victory in a row, gave up just 
four hits and a run. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees tied it when relief pitcher Larry Andersen threw away a potential 
double play ball in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees broke it open in the eighth against Jeff Gray (2-4). Former Dodger 
Steve Sax had the big hit, a two-run triple that broke the 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the eighth the Red Sox missed a chance to regain the lead. They 
had runners on first and second with one out, but Eric Plunk (6-3), the winner 
in relief, got Tom Brunansky to hit into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
The delay is believed the longest for a game that was played. Earlier this 
season Texas and Chicago waited 7 1/2 hours, but the game was never played. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was announced as 37,795, but fewer than half were around for the 
start. By the time the 3 1/2-hour game ended, most of those had departed, too. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Detroit 1 -- Scott Sanderson gained his career-high 17th victory and 
Rickey Henderson hit his 27th home run as the Athletics moved closer to their 
third division title in a row at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Although he moved within five steals of Lou Brock's lifetime record of 938, 
Henderson lost ground in the batting race by going one for four. George Brett 
was four for four and is at .332, 10 points ahead of Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson (17-10) gave up three hits and an unearned run in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about it till it's done," Manager Tony La Russa of the 
A's said, "but we're fast approaching one of those special days." DAN HAFNER

THEY NEEDN'T GO FAR FOR INSPIRATION; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDERS CAN LOOK TO SHELL, STEELERS TO GREENE FOR BEST OF THEIR 
TEAMS' TRADITIONS AT COLISEUM TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After all these years, it's still Art Shell and Mean Joe Greene going head to 
head for the Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
One of football's greatest rivalries and one-on-one matchups resumes today at 
the Coliseum after a five-year layoff during which both teams have struggled to 
recapture past glories. For answers, the Raiders and Steelers have turned back 
the clock and hired two slices of the 1970s, a decade punctuated by crushing 
playoff battles and one Immaculate and/or Forgettable Reception, depending on 
which side of Franco Harris you were standing. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders haven't made the playoffs since 1985. That's five years in normal 
time, darn near an epoch in Al Davis years. 
</P>
<P>
So last Oct. 3, Davis handed his team over to Shell, a Raider if ever there was 
one: 15 seasons at tackle, eight Pro Bowls, a bust on display in Canton, Ohio. 
Shell has responded with seven home victories without a loss and a 2-0 start in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers, barely a break-even team in the 1980s at 77-75 and 10 seasons 
removed from their fourth Super Bowl victory, have the AFC's second-ranked 
defense and 11 sacks in two games. Time to raise another Steel Curtain? Well, 
they've turned up the heat with help from a defensive line coach named Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Greene and Shell, arguably the best two players at their positions, faced each 
other on a regular basis. Now, they're trying to infuse their players with the 
work ethic of yesteryear, when merely picking up a paycheck wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We were at the Pro Bowl once," Shell recalled last week. "We were practicing 
in L.A., and (Greene) said to me: 'Too bad they don't have a league for people 
like you and I, so when we get about 48 or 50 years old, we can still play this 
game.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is about as close as it gets, squaring off against each other from 
opposite sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, if he does nothing else in his life, has made a starting defensive end 
out of Donald Evans, the Rams' top pick of 1987, who was categorically rejected 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see Joe's tenacity coming out in those guys," Shell said. "Joe and I 
talked about this in the off-season, just the idea of getting our teams back 
playing the way we were accustomed to seeing them play." 
</P>
<P>
Today's pregame speech by Shell to his players undoubtedly will be laced with 
anecdotes about his rumbles with Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"If you love the game of football, you had to love playing in a game like 
that," Shell said of the rivalry. "Those were exciting games, fun games. You 
had a good time on the field. . . . It was the will of individuals going 
against each other. . . . It was just an exciting time for me as a player to 
play against those guys. I always had fun playing against the Steelers, 
jockeying back and forth with a guy like Joe Greene. After a play, I'd say, 
'What are you doing here back in my backfield?' Those kinds of things. After 
you talk, you try to line up and knock each other's head off. But after the 
game we were still friends." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have opened the season with two victories over divisional opponents 
despite scoring only two touchdowns on offense. The Steelers (1-1) have not 
scored an offensive touchdown, winning last Sunday's game against Houston, 
20-9, with two field goals, a 52-yard punt return and a 26-yard interception 
return. 
</P>
<P>
The Steeler offense, coordinated these days by former Jet coach Joe Walton, is 
averaging 2.2 yards per rush and 3.5 yards per pass. They're five for 28 on 
third-down conversions. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the Steelers fell two points short of advancing to the AFC title game 
last year without Walton, who has changed the entire offensive scheme and 
terminology. So far, it's all been Greek to quarterback Bubby Brister, who has 
complained publicly about his summer homework assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose a little bit in the translation," Steeler Coach Chuck Noll 
acknowledged. "Some of us are thinking in the old language, and that's causing 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
So why change? 
</P>
<P>
"You'll probably have to ask Chuck Noll that question," Brister said. "If I say 
something wrong, he's probably going to kick my butt." 
</P>
<P>
Noll argues that the offense needed some sprucing up after finishing 28th 
overall and last in passing in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Brister said the offense was at first complicated, but added that the changes 
will be better for the team in the long run. He noted that the Steelers were 
outscored, 92-10, in their first two games last season and rallied to reach the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they threw a lot at us, so we'll study and stay in," Brister said, 
"and maybe not ease down to the bar to get a beer. Everything's just new." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The teams haven't played each other since Dec. 16, 1984, at the Coliseum. The 
Steelers won, 13-7, and clinched their ninth AFC Central Division title. . . . 
The Raiders lead the regular-season series, 6-3. The teams have split six 
playoff games. . . . The Raiders are one of six undefeated teams remaining in 
the NFL this season. . . . After two games, Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder's 
quarterback rating of 87.1 is higher than the ratings of Dan Marino, John 
Elway, Warren Moon, Boomer Esiason and Joe Montana. . . . With Mike Dyal 
injured, don't be surprised to see Marcus Allen line up at tight end in some 
situations, as he did last Sunday during the Raiders' 17-13 victory over the 
Seahawks in Seattle.

RAMS SEEK TO KEEP EAGLES GROUNDED; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: NO LOVE WILL BE LOST WHEN THE TEAMS PLAY AT ANAHEIM STADIUM 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Perhaps because they so clearly dislike each other and so often seek the same 
prize, the Rams and the Philadelphia Eagles keep getting thrown together. 
</P>
<P>
When there is a coach's job to be saved or lost, when there is a playoff spot 
to win, when there is a season to salvage, almost always, these teams are 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
When there are insults to exchange, brash words to bellow, fingers to jab in 
the direction of a particularly upsetting opponent, almost always, it's the 
Rams against the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a sort of rivalry that's building more and more each year," Ram 
quarterback Jim Everett said. "There's certainly no love lost between the 
Eagles and the Rams, I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
When the Rams play the Eagles today at Anaheim Stadium, there is only Buddy 
Ryan's tenure as Philadelphia's coach to maintain, the Eagles' status as 
contenders to retain and the Rams' hopes for early season momentum to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
You think the 1-1 Rams wouldn't love to knock the Eagles to 0-3, sending the 
Ryan Era into its most serious tailspin? You think the Eagles wouldn't savor 
arising from their pratfall out of the gate to knock down the team that 
eliminated them from last season's playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
The scene was set for this game late last December when the Rams used a tricky 
zone defense to throttle the Eagle offense for a 21-7 wild-card victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Rams' first defeat of a Ryan-coached Eagle team, and the loss 
amplified whispers that owner Norman Braman would not tolerate another playoff 
flop. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, we'd like another shot at them," Eagle defensive coordinator Jeff 
Fisher said. "There's a lot of reason to go there and get back at them. We've 
had a lot of success against them up until this point, and we stumbled." 
</P>
<P>
And here the Eagles are, stumbling in September, coming off a 23-21 upset loss 
at home to the Phoenix Cardinals. Talk of ousting Ryan is getting louder. 
</P>
<P>
"We look back to our loss last year against the Rams and we see we had the 
opportunity to do something," Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham said. "Now 
we're 0-2, we're either going to rebound and bounce back and have a good year, 
or it's not going to happen. Sooner or later, we need a win." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are not calling this a must-win situation. They are not saying that 
they must avoid an 0-3 start to stay in playoff contention. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar situation in 1988, the Eagles were 4-5, coming off a home loss to 
Atlanta and playing for Ryan's job against the Rams, who were 7-2. The Eagles 
pulled it out, 30-24. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're going to surprise us," Everett said. "They're coming. 
(But) I don't really give a . . . about the Philadelphia Eagles. What concerns 
me is the Los Angeles Rams. We have no control over what (the Eagles) do. 
</P>
<P>
"They can come in here, they can be . . . off, whatever. But the only thing we 
can control is ourselves. We're fighting in our division. We can't afford to 
lose ballgames. That's what we can control. I don't give a . . . about the rest 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a good football team. They're a good football team. Both teams have a 
lot riding on this game, and we're coming to play to win." 
</P>
<P>
Each team, so familiar with what the other wants to do, has no doubts about 
what the key aspects of today's game will be. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, as they did last December, hope to confine Cunningham to the pocket 
and use a mixture of zone defenses to take away his deep passes. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as a direct result of their inability to decipher the Rams' zones, the 
Eagles dumped offensive coordinator Ted Plumb and hired Rich Kotite to revamp 
and revitalize the offense. But the Rams say that as long as Cunningham is the 
quarterback, the defensive game plan doesn't change. 
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis is pretty much the same," Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur 
said. "Obviously, the big part of the attack is built around Cunningham. He's 
their leading rusher right now. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the emphasis of the offense is the same as it was a year ago. I'm 
looking at similar kinds of action. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think you can go play him exactly the same way this time. They've 
had the opportunity to look at that film, see us. So it would be goofy to go in 
there with the same kind of plan." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Philadelphia has Pro Bowl tight end Keith Jackson back after a long 
holdout, and although he didn't return to the team until Wednesday, he is 
expected to play extensively. The Eagle offense has struggled without him and 
is counting on his presence to open things up for a young set of receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia hopes to overwhelm the Ram offensive line and create turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Through their first two losses, the Eagles have created only two turnovers, a 
flaw in Ryan's all-or-nothing scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the history of our football team, if we don't get turnovers, we 
usually don't win," Ryan said. "Things just haven't popped the right way, but 
they will. Things balance out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have one of the best defensive lines in pro football. We've gotten 
to most quarterbacks in this league, and I don't see why we can't get to 
Everett." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
This is the Eagles' first visit to Anaheim Stadium. The last time they played 
the Rams in the Southland was in 1977, when they lost, 20-0, at the Coliseum. 
It was Ram quarterback Joe Namath's last NFL victory. . . . Buddy Ryan got his 
first NFL coaching victory when the Eagles beat the Rams in 1986.

</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS' BOWEN FINDS WRITERS A VOWEL LESS THAN LETTER-PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leafing through some newspapers Saturday morning and seeing his name misspelled 
in most of them -- again -- might have made Cory Bowen wince. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch! There's that E again. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was already sore all over, having been tackled 21 times the night 
before by Canyon High's vicious defense. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen, Thousand Oaks' junior tailback, gained 133 yards in Canyon's 27-13 
victory, impressing everyone from Cowboy defenders to rival coaches scouting 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
But after browsing through the paper, Bowen mused that it is awfully tough for 
a guy to make a name for himself when almost everybody gets it wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Including sportswriters. And his coach. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, an E has been wedged into his first name like a running back squeezing 
between guard and tackle. The Lancer program lists him as Corey, which is 
probably the reason three of the four newspapers that cover Thousand Oaks write 
his name that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is always doing that," Bowen said. "I have no idea how it started. 
It's a little bothersome but it happens all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Richards, the Thousand Oaks coach, noticed that newspapers were spelling 
Bowen's first name differently. In an effort to clear it up Friday night, he 
took a reporter aside and said, "You know, his name is spelled C-O-R-E-Y." 
</P>
<P>
Richards might be excused: He's a math teacher who knows Bowen best as No. 20, 
the player who has gained 313 yards in three games. Richards has no trouble 
counting. 
</P>
<P>
What's in a name, anyway? Not a lot, unless it's yours that is continually 
being butchered. 
</P>
<P>
The easy answer would have been for somebody -- anybody -- to ask Bowen how he 
spells his name. That's right, actually talk to him. Then maybe the scribes 
could save their E's for describing his running style, elusive and full of 
extra effort. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has asked me yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unraveled plot: What Cleveland needed in the fourth quarter Friday night 
against Fairfax was a director, a real Hollywood type with dark shades and gold 
chains, to dash onto the field, stop play and yell: Cut, cut, whadaya, whadaya, 
that's not in the script! 
</P>
<P>
Taking a page from the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl playbook, the Cavaliers 
scripted their first 25 plays from scrimmage, detailing before the game the 
precise order in which signals would be called. 
</P>
<P>
And for three quarters, they had a blockbuster in the making: Cleveland led, 
7-0, after scoring on the game's opening drive and held the lead heading into 
the final 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The ending was a real tear-jerker, however, leaving the performance with mixed 
reviews. Fairfax scored three touchdowns to win, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd have played the whole game like we did the first series, we'd have 
blown them out," said David Erhardt, Cleveland's quarterback. "Everything was 
going according to plan, then I think some guys just got tired." 
</P>
<P>
Erhardt, playing in his first game as a Cavalier after transferring from Canoga 
Park, was not shy about panning his play. His fumble on an option play led to 
Fairfax's winning touchdown. "I stepped up after the game and told the team 
we're gonna run five miles on Monday," Erhardt said. "But it was my fault as 
much as anybody's." 
</P>
<P>
Flags: The 220 yards in penalties racked up by Locke on Friday night exceeded 
the National Football League record of 209 set by the Cleveland Browns against 
the Chicago Bears on Nov. 25, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties are supposed to be fatal, yet Locke destroyed Verdugo Hills, 27-0, 
behind a defense that allowed only 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt so good: Newbury Park players streamed into Mel Hayashi's office Saturday, 
getting balm from the team doctor. But the Panthers had no emotional wounds for 
a change, thanks to a convincing 17-0 victory over Buena on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, all the sophisticated orthopedic gadgetry in Hayashi's office 
couldn't mend the mental anguish caused by Newbury Park's heartbreaking, 21-20 
loss to Ventura, a game that slipped through the Panthers' fingers when Ventura 
scored on a 68-yard desperation pass on the game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt like we won but we didn't," said running back Dave Roberts as he 
fiercely pedaled away on a stationary bicycle. "People at school would ask if 
we won and I'd want to say yes, but I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
This week the answer will be resoundingly affirmative, and the victory proved 
an affirmation of Newbury Park's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"We were robbed big time against Ventura and there was no way it was going to 
happen again," quarterback Zack Sutton said while Hayashi worked on his sore 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in the back of everybody's mind and we put out some extra effort." 
</P>
<P>
Forward progress: The recovery of talented Newbury Park tailback Walter Thomas, 
who underwent surgery on his left knee two weeks ago, is ahead of schedule. 
Hayashi said the chances of Thomas playing Thursday in Newbury Park's Marmonte 
League opener against Thousand Oaks are 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give him credit, he's worked very hard," Hayashi said. "On 
Thursday, I ran sprints against him and I beat him. One day later, he beat me 
running backwards while I was running forward." 
</P>
<P>
Buddy system: For second-year Newbury Park Coach George Hurley, familiarity 
breeds shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Under Hurley, the Panthers have twice blanked Buena -- no small feat 
considering the Bulldogs' reputation for high-powered offense. 
</P>
<P>
Hurley and Buena Coach Rick Scott both served as Newbury Park assistants 
through most of the 1970s. They remain friends, although they don't always see 
eye to eye. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick and I worked together for a long time, and preparing for his team is like 
preparing for ourselves," Hurley said. "He runs the same plays we do, they just 
throw the ball more." 
</P>
<P>
Scott isn't quite ready to concede that Hurley knows him like the back of his 
playbook. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really a different type of team than they are," Scott said. "I don't do 
the same things I did when I was at Newbury Park." 
</P>
<P>
Who's right? Hurley points to the scoreboard and rests his case.

DELAWARE PARK GOES AFTER THE ATLANTIC CITY CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE AUSTIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John E. Mooney is tired of watching buses from Maryland go through Delaware on 
their way to the slot machines at Atlantic City, N.J., so he's doing something 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney, general manager at Delaware Park, is convinced that most of the 
gamblers are slot-machine types and not headed for the tables. 
</P>
<P>
"The slot machines pay off at 85 percent," he said Friday. "So we've created a 
pick three bet that pays the same amount. Instead of taking out 25 percent the 
way we usually do for exotic bets, we're only taking out 15 percent. We hope 
the customers realize it is the same as the slots." 
</P>
<P>
Mooney calls it the "Win 3" wager. There's the standard requirement of a 
winning ticket having the winners of the fifth, sixth and seventh races. 
</P>
<P>
His publicist, Steve Kallens, points out that at Philadelphia Park, the takeout 
on the big exotic bets is 30 percent. That's before the other 70 percent of the 
money is redistributed to winning bettors. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a $10,000 payoff at the 25 percent takeout level, under the new 
system, the winner would get $3,000 more, Mooney pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
The takeout on regular win, place and show bets is at the 17 percent level. 
Exacta and Daily Double bets are taxed at a slightly higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney had to get special permission of the Delaware State Racing Commission 
and the state attorney general's office before reducing the takeout formula. In 
theory, the state might lose out on some money as its share of lost revenue. 
But Mooney hopes that less money taken out will attract more gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he may have scared other operators of pari-mutuel ventures around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the operators of race tracks and jai alai frontons want larger 
shares of each betting dollar. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few studies that show each time the takeout goes up, a few more 
racing fans are turned off. 
</P>
<P>
But many operators besides Mooney see horseplayers as caring only about cashing 
a bet instead of looking at the mathematics of it. 
</P>
<P>
Delaware Park will shut down Nov. 4 following a meeting that began March 17. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a short vacation," Mooney said. "Early next year, we'll be at the 
legislature. We've got a slots bill we want to push through." 
</P>
<P>
The prospects of the Unbridled-Summer Squall race in the Super Derby at 
Louisiana Downs had such appeal that the New York City off-track betting shops 
even took advance bets on the race Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Betting on race day will be available by way of simulcasting at Laurel Race 
Course and the intertrack facility at Pimlico Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, the Kentucky Derby winner lost to Summer Squall in the Preakness but 
the two haven't met since. 
</P>
<P>
A field of 10 is expected. Among them is Restless Con, who won the Haskell at 
Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day remains on Summer Squall. Jose Velez Jr. rides Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
The track oddsmaker lists Summer Squall as 6-5 favorite; Unbridled is second at 
5-2.

HARTMAN MEETS NEW CHALLENGE IN ROYAL INVITATIONAL VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: CANYON SENIOR RISES TO THE OCCASION IN TRAVERSING MOORPARK 
COLLEGE'S HILLY COURSE IN 15 MINUTES 11 SECONDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Hartman of Canyon High recorded speedy times on relatively flat 
cross-country courses the past two weeks, but Moorpark College's hilly, 
three-mile course presented a tougher challenge. 
</P>
<P>
With two sub-15 minute efforts under his belt already this season, Hartman 
timed 15 minutes 11 seconds to win the large-schools race at the Royal 
Invitational on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The time is exceptional considering the difficulty of the course, but a lengthy 
training regimen is wearing on the Cowboy senior. 
</P>
<P>
"These hills took it out of me," Hartman said. "I've been putting in so much 
mileage that I've just been real tired. I've been popping vitamin C like 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Hartman's fatigue became evident when he slowed to a 10-minute 8-second split 
at two miles after a 4:38 first mile. But Hartman proved Sept. 8 that he can 
handle a fast, early pace. At the Seaside Invitational in Ventura, he ran a 
4:29 first mile en route to a 14:33 clocking. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wilson of Newbury Park was second in 15:26 and Channel Islands teammates 
Stewart Ellington (15:27) and Fernando Mendoza (15:54) were third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, which placed three runners among the top 10, defeated archrival Canyon, 
66-72, for the team title despite running without Billy Dixon, who is 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"We group real well. We always have," Hart Coach Gene Blankenship said. "(Gavin 
Klinger) saved our butts." 
</P>
<P>
Klinger, a freshman, finished sixth in 16:11 to lead the Indians. Keith 
Grossman (16:14) and Hector Chavez (16:15) placed eighth and ninth. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' race, Channel Islands' Veronica Barajas challenged Jeannie 
Rothman of Westlake but the Warrior senior took over with about 1 1/2 miles 
remaining to win in 17:55. Barajas placed second in 18:14. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman was trying to break the course record of 17:26 held by Agoura's Deena 
Drossin but the pace dawdled early. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if Deena had been here, I would have been closer because she really 
pushes me," Rothman said. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Barajas' second-place finish, Channel Islands won its first invitational 
title, 65-67, over favored Buena. However, the Bulldogs competed without Fanya 
Bryant, who is injured. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore placed four runners among the top seven to handily win the 
small-schools boys' title with 32 points. Nordhoff (89) and Moorpark (91) were 
second and third. George Barajas paced the Flashes with a 16:10 win. 
</P>
<P>
Maribella Aparicio of Fillmore won the girls' small-schools race in 18:44 and 
Nordhoff claimed the title with 39 points.

ODD KICK RETURN PROPELS BEVERLY HILLS PAST HARVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harvard High had not beaten archrival Beverly Hills since 1983 and had dropped 
12 of the past 13 meetings with the Normans. 
</P>
<P>
But this was supposed to be the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Division VII Saracens entered Saturday's home game with a 2-0 record, and 
the Division III Normans limped in at 0-2. Add to that the fact that Beverly 
Hills had skipped two days of practice because of Rosh Hashanah, and the 
outlook looked bright for the boys of Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
However, all that prognostication didn't take into account a quirky kickoff 
return that helped propel Beverly Hills to a 24-12 nonleague win at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
With Harvard leading, 6-3, early in the third quarter, Beverly Hills' Darren 
Smith fielded a kickoff at his own 20, where he immediately fumbled. The ball 
bounced 10 yards in front of him and through a swarm of about a dozen players. 
Smith quickly appeared on the other side of the cluster, picked up the ball and 
raced untouched for a touchdown and a 10-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a real deflater," Harvard Coach Gary Thran said. "Sometimes you're 
faced with a situation that you just can't do anything about." 
</P>
<P>
That helpless feeling continued as the Saracens watched Beverly Hills 
quarterback Ziv Gottlieb connect for a pair of third-quarter touchdown passes 
and a 24-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb, who completed 11 of 24 passes for 157 yards, hit David Saraf on a 
49-yard scoring play and found tight end Carl Benedetti from six yards. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard had taken the 6-3 lead on the first drive of the second half, when 
Iheanyi Uwaezuoke caught a 32-yard touchdown pass from reserve quarterback Greg 
Peters. Bobby Bell added a 33-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter.

TAFT GANGS UP ON HAMILTON, 28-0;

Taft High's unrelenting defensive line and its productive offensive backfield 
proved too much for Hamilton on Saturday night, as the Toreadors shut out the 
Yankees, 28-0, in a nonleague football game at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreadors held Hamilton to just two yards in total offense in the second 
half and caught the Yankees behind the line of scrimmage in five of Hamilton's 
13 plays for a loss of 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Hendricks, who rushed for 97 yards in 10 carries in the first half, 
scored Taft's first touchdown on a 12-yard run with one minute 13 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks, a 6-foot-2, 190-pound running back, scored again on Taft's first 
series of the second half. The Toreadors went 56 yards in six plays, with 
Hendricks taking it in for a touchdown from the 10. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks finished with 124 yards in 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, which gained 70 yards in the first half, had all kinds of trouble 
moving the ball in the second half. With Taft leading, 14-0, Hamilton 
quarterback Julio Gomez called two running plays before Rueben Benitiz picked 
off a Gomez pass and returned it 39 yards to Hamilton's 27-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
After two clipping penalties, Taft quarterback Jessie Menchaca connected with 
Vance Swendell on a 30-yard touchdown pass. Taft faked the extra point, with 
Menchaca, who was holding for kicker Carlos Mansilla, rising from a a kneeling 
position and hitting Daryl Cash for a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Harris provided the Toreadors with 60 yards in five carries. 
</P>
<P>
Taft dominated on both sides of the ball, but the Toreadors looked sloppy at 
times. Taft fumbled four times in the second half, losing possession twice.

LACK OF LEADERSHIP COSTS OCCIDENTAL IN A 28-10 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Occidental College had no answer for Azusa Pacific quarterback Brian Hunt in a 
28-10 nonconference football loss Saturday night at Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, the second-leading passer in the NAIA Division II ranks, completed 19 of 
37 passes for 240 yards and one touchdown. The senior from Glendora also ran 
for touchdowns of two and six yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a really, really good player, I can't imagine we'll see a better player 
than him," Occidental Coach Dale Widolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Occidental unable to pressure Hunt in the last three quarters, nor 
cover his many receivers, the Tiger offense could not move the ball after the 
opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental (1-2) scored first on its only sustained drive of the first half. 
Brian Madlangbayan, a 5-foot-6 scatback, scooted outside and found running room 
on the second play of the drive for a 20-yard gain. Madlangbayan carried three 
more times for 11 yards and freshman quarterback Derrick Williams picked up 
four yards on a keeper. But Williams could not convert on third-and-seven from 
the seven so Occidental settled for a 27-yard field goal by Mark Collinsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Though Williams was impressive last week in a 38-13 win over Whittier, he 
lacked a passing touch against Azusa Pacific (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
When the left-hander had time to throw, he overshot his receivers. And when he 
was chased out of the pocket, he underthrew them. 
</P>
<P>
With eight minutes 18 seconds left in the first half, Williams was replaced by 
junior John Selle. Williams hit on two of seven passes for seven yards before 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Williams started the second half, but after two possessions without a first 
down, he was replaced again by Selle, who threw an interception with 1:59 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Selle finished with two completions in 10 attempts and had two passes 
intercepted. Williams completed four-of-14 for 25 yards. It took third-string 
quarterback Scott Thompson to bring the Tigers a touchdown. His 36-yard pass to 
Charles Jordan set up his 1-yard touchdown keeper with two seconds left to 
account for the 28-10 final. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrick Williams is a great talent," Widolff said. "He can do some great 
things. But he can also make some bad plays and we have to hope there's more 
good plays than bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
Widolff doesn't feel as though he has to name one of them his starter and stick 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
Widolff hadn't given consideration to adding Thompson to the mix until he saw 
Thompson lead the Tigers to their only touchdown. The junior transfer from 
Butte College completed three of four passes for 67 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"That is his history," Widolff said. "You look at him and there's nothing 
special, but he gets the job done. That (playing Thompson) is something we may 
have to consider."

ARREOLA AND VETT PACE NORTHRIDGE IN CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darcy Arreola and Derik Vett led the Cal State Northridge women's and men's 
cross-country teams to seventh- and ninth-place finishes Saturday in the Aztec 
Invitational at San Diego's Morley Field. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the 1989 Division II cross-country champion, placed fourth in the 
women's race with a time of 17 minutes 27.6 seconds over the 5,000-meter 
course, and Vett finished 16th in the men's race with a time of 25:47.2 for the 
five-mile distance. 
</P>
<P>
Vett, a senior from Buena High, was in 12th place after two miles before 
dropping back into the mid-20s at the three-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, powered by the 2-3-4 finish of Brian Grosso, Marc Davis and Martin 
Keino, won the men's team title with 30 points, followed by Northern Arizona 
(65) and UC Santa Barbara (91). Northridge had 331 points. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, who finished second to Buffy Rabbitt of UC Irvine in the Fresno 
Invitational last week, was trailing Rabbitt by approximately 20 yards in 
Saturday's race before taking a wrong turn with a half-mile left. The mistake 
cost her 30 yards in distance and two places, according to Strametz. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't run badly," CSUN Coach Don Strametz said. "But I think she was a 
little tired. We didn't ease up for this meet. We trained right through it." 
</P>
<P>
In other cross-country meets: 
</P>
<P>
SCIAC double-dual: Marcial Beltran of Occidental, timed in 26 minutes 59.7 
seconds for five miles, broke the course record at Redlands by more than a 
minute as the Tigers defeated Redlands, 17-46, and Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Schuster led an Occidental sweep of the first five places in the women's 
race, clocking 20:21.0 for 5,000 meters, and the Tigers beat Redlands and 
Pomona-Pitzer by identical scores of 15-50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
Occidental 14, La Verne 0 -- Occidental (2-1-1) set four school records in the 
SCIAC match. Jos Bergmann scored five goals, the first after 52 seconds, and 
had three assists to set Occidental records for most goals in a match, fastest 
goal and most points (13) in a match. The Tigers' 14 goals also set a school 
match record. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEN'S WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Los Angeles 19, Occidental 4 -- Robert Jaffe scored two goals in the 
losing effort. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
The Master's 6, Cal State San Bernardino 2 -- Corey Hooper scored two goals to 
lead the Mustangs (4-4-1) at San Bernardino. Chris Palm added a goal for his 
10th score in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOYS' CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
Junior J. J. Castner of Oak Park timed 15 minutes 19 seconds in winning the 
small-schools race of the Warren Invitational at Cal State Dominguez Hills.

KUSCH FINALLY WINS HOBBY STOCK TITLE AT SAUGUS SPEEDWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a slightly chilly Saturday night at Saugus Speedway, Hobby Stock driver Jim 
Kusch of Sepulveda felt the warming cloak of a long-awaited championship. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of racing in the Hobby Stock division at Saugus -- "Since its 
inception," Kusch said -- all he had to do to sew up the 1990 points 
championship was, basically, show up. 
</P>
<P>
Well, of course he had to get into his car and start the engine and even bring 
it out for the oval main, but that was about all that was needed for Kusch to 
claim the final title of the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
Kusch, 39, who entered the night 24 points ahead of Jim Gunnarson of Reseda, 
clinched the title with a fourth-place finish in the Hobby Stock oval before a 
crowd of 3,251. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe it to these two men," the affable Kusch said in the pits, pointing to 
crew members Rip Michels and Dave Moak. 
</P>
<P>
Kusch, whose previous high finish in the points standings was fourth place, 
credited Michels with working different spring combinations on his ride and 
praised Moak, the mechanic who "likes to get his hands greasy." 
</P>
<P>
The worst-case scenario for Kusch -- that Gunnarson would win both main events 
and he himself not finish in the top 12 in either -- was erased with the 
running of the oval main. 
</P>
<P>
Kusch said he plans to take next year off and let Moak take a turn behind the 
wheel. Then, in 1992, Kusch plans to cruise a Street Stock ride that he will 
build next year. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, Bob Vigil of Lancaster won the Hobby Stock oval 25-lap main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kellick of Bakersfield ran away with the three-quarter midget main event, 
passing Kara Hendrick of Upland on Lap 13 of the 20-lapper and not looking 
back. Kellick, who won the main event the last time the three-quarters raced at 
Saugus in July, actually passed Kendrick on Lap 12 of the race, but had to 
return to second place on a yellow flag. He passed her almost immediately after 
the restart. 
</P>
<P>
Mini-stock points champion Garrett Yamada finished his season with yet another 
main-event win in a six-lapper. 
</P>
<P>
In the tightest race of all, Kerry Mulligan of Granada Hills finished ahead of 
Richard Smith of Reseda in the 15-lap figure-eight to sew up the 1990 Jalopy 
division points championship. 
</P>
<P>
Coming into the evening, Mulligan held a three-point edge over Smith.

MSL MAKES A MOVE ON SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest conspiracy theory emanating from the San Diego Sports Arena: The 
Major Soccer League is out to get the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence: Over the summer the MSL increased the size of the goal 33 percent 
and entered a labor agreement that helped reduce the Sockers' defense by 75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
The sleuth who uncovered this plot: Erich Geyer, Sockers assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We've won in the past because we've been successful on offense," Geyer said. 
"The other teams that don't have our skill saw this and said, 'Hey, let's open 
the gates so we can score, too, so we can compete.' " 
</P>
<P>
The flood gates will open all right -- at least at one end of the Sports Arena. 
That's because the Sockers are currently without six of the eight defenders who 
last season helped them to their eighth championship in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
When the per-team salary cap was reduced from $770,000 to $630,000 in July, 
most players were made free agents, and the Sockers could not afford to match 
offers received by three of their top defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Zoltan Toth, who had the league's second-best goals-against average last 
year at 3.48, signed with St. Louis for $62,000. Defenders George Fernandez, 
who led the Sockers in blocked shots with 98, took an offer from Cleveland. And 
Ralph Black, third on the team in blocks with 57, went to Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it appears that fullbacks Cacho, Donald Cogsville and Arturo 
Velazco will not return. 
</P>
<P>
Cacho was not guaranteed a spot on the final roster and so far has not reported 
to training camp because he has not been offered a contract. Cogsville has 
chronic problems with his right knee and did not take the team's physical. And 
Velazco, who would have been the No. 2 defender behind Kevin Crow, is 
attempting to catch on with a Mexican club. 
</P>
<P>
So, how worried is Coach Ron Newman? 
</P>
<P>
"I would say I'm concerned at the moment," he said. "But there are several 
options I've got, and until I use them all, I'm not going to be nervous, 
because in the past things have always worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Options? One is signing a 30-year-old Soviet player who in 1987 was a member of 
the Moscow Dynamo team that toured the United States and played seven games. 
That's the extent of Alex Golovnia's indoor experience. 
</P>
<P>
After five days of training camp, Newman said Golovnia's inexperience is 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's unfamiliar with the game," Newman said. "Very much so." 
</P>
<P>
Another option is to pry No. 1 draft pick Marcelo Balboa from the U.S. national 
team. That should be no problem since Balboa was allowed to moonlight for the 
outdoor San Francisco Bay Blackhawks after the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
But because the U.S. team will use this week to train for two exhibitions 
against an MSL select team Sept. 28 and 30, Balboa will not make it to the 
Sockers' training camp until early October. That would give him roughly two 
weeks to make the transition to indoor. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is David Banks, the third draft pick from Philadelphia 
Textile. However, the Sockers have never kept their third choice. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only once have the Sockers kept as many as two picks. In 1980, forward 
Jim Stamatis and goalie John Putna stuck. The Sockers finished 6-12, last in 
the North American Soccer League's Southern Division, the only time they failed 
to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Neither player was around a year later when the Sockers began their string of 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
In Newman's system, drafted college players have always been too green to 
immediately contribute. But now there's a good chance three-and quite possibly 
four-will make the team. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Banks and Balboa, forward Eddie Henderson, the fourth overall selection 
from Washington, has accepted an offer. Henderson was singled out by Newman as 
being most impressive in early training camp. He may be put in the defensive 
runner position, where Paul Wright blossomed two years ago and where Wes Wade 
became one of the top newcomers last year. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no experienced goalie in camp to take over for Toth, 
fourth-round pick Eric Yamamoto, from defending NCAA co-champion UC Santa 
Clara, could also find a spot. 
</P>
<P>
That so many draft picks could make it is indicative of the upheaval on the 
Sockers' roster. When training camp began Sept. 17, the team had only seven 
players from last year's roster in the fold: goalie Victor Nogueira, defensive 
runner Wright, defender Crow, forward Rod Castro and midfielders Branko Segota, 
Waad Hirmez and Brian Quinn. Since then, they have signed two more, Wade and 
forward Jim Gabarra. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were 21 players on the roster at the end of last season, the 
club is likely to come to terms with only three more: midfielders Thien Nguyen, 
Ben Collins and Rene Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
Two others from last season appear to be on the outside. Midfielder Jacques 
Ladouceur said he won't sign unless he is offered more money, and Newman said 
none is forthcoming. Also, Damir Haramina was told not to bother. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is also one of three teams not to land a free agent (along with 
Wichita and Kansas City) during the off-season. But that's not due to a lack of 
trying, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to everybody and their mothers," he said. "But all our big money was 
taken, so we were forced to look at players in the $30,000 range. We were real 
close on a couple, but each time, some other club came up with an extra $5,000. 
Plus, I heard from a lot of players that San Diego is just too expensive (a 
place to live)."

L.A. FESTIVAL WAS MORE THAN AN ARTS CELEBRATION; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: THE CITY GOT TO BETTER KNOW ITS MULTIETHNIC AND INTERGENERATIONAL 
SELF. BUT INSTITUTIONALIZING THE FEST WOULD KILL ITS SPIRIT AND MISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maureen A. Kindel, Maureen A. Kindel, president of the public-affairs 
consulting firm of Rose &amp; Kindel, is board chairwoman of the 1990 Los 
Angeles Festival. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A great deal was written and said about the just-completed Los Angeles 
Festival. Some hailed the arts celebration as a huge success and a 
groundbreaking event. Others complained that the festival's brochure bewildered 
them, dampening their interest. 
</P>
<P>
Without a doubt, the 1990 Los Angeles Festival was a triumph. Indeed, a page in 
the cultural and racial history of the city has been turned. 
</P>
<P>
As planned, 290 events, 70% free, were presented at more than 70 venues across 
the city. Audience attendance at festival events requiring tickets was, on 
average, 73% of capacity, well above the projected 60%. The 16-day festival 
earned $725,000, $125,000 above projected. 
</P>
<P>
As for the quality of the art presented, audiences and critics basically agreed 
-- festival fare was exotic and excellent. Never before had Los Angeles seen 
such companies as the Bread and Puppet Theatre, the Children of Bali, El Gran 
Circo Teatro de Chile, Japan's Uwanuda Kagura Troupe, the Wallis &amp; Futuna 
Musicians and Dancers, and the Cambodian Classical Dance Troupe. They were the 
brilliant substance of an arts festival that truly reflected Los Angeles 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this the multiethnic and intergenerational audiences, and you had 
something special happening. Latino families experiencing Thai folk opera in 
Alhambra Park; a predominantly white audience cheering the F.A.M.E. Gospel 
Choir at the Hollywood Bowl; young people discovering a 400-year-old folk dance 
with the townspeople of Gujo Hachiman, Japan, at Santa Monica Pier; parents 
taking their children to an airport hangar for their first taste of theater -- 
courtesy of Bread and Puppet Theatre. The non-subscription sellout of "Nixon in 
China," directed by festival director Peter Sellars, suggested that many who 
attended the performance were introduced to the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
There were other artistic precedents: The F.A.M.E. Gospel Choir, long a staple 
of South-Central Los Angeles, sharing equal billing with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. Barbara Carrasco unfurling her mural, "The History of Los 
Angeles," at Union Station. Since 1981, it had languished in Cesar Chavez's 
garage because the city, after commissioning the mural, apparently forgot it. 
</P>
<P>
For me, one moment embodied the festival's purpose. In The Times' account of 
festival attendance in Santa Monica, it was reported that a man had stumbled 
onto an event at the pier. Although he knew nothing of the Los Angeles 
Festival, the unwitting participant in art fulfilled Sellars' strongest mission 
-- to take the festival into so many communities that it could not be missed. 
The free, outdoor events -- at Angels Gate in San Pedro, Descanso Gardens in La 
Canada-Flintridge, Griffith Park, Reseda Park, San Julian Park, the Wat Thai 
Temple in North Hollywood, Olvera Street, Chinatown and the African Marketplace 
-- were thus the heart of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
The festival also broke new fund-raising ground. We received support from 
contributors whom traditional sources warned us would never come forth. The 
local Korean, Cambodian, African-American, Chinese-American and Latino 
communities provided key financial assistance through fund-raising 
entertainment, neighborhood parties and other events. These new sources, along 
with the reliably strong support of Mayor Tom Bradley, our city partners, the 
Japanese business community, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
and corporate and private funders created the foundation for the entire arts 
enterprise. They will be the keys to future fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
In planning for 1993, we must also admit that because of the breathless 
fund-raising pace at which we were operating, the organization of the 1990 
festival began a full year too late. With monies in place earlier, we would 
have had more time to tend to the monumental task of producing and marketing 
the 1993 event. The 1990 Festival was an extraordinarily complex enterprise, 
and, quite simply, we must learn from our mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
In the euphoria of the moment, some want to institutionalize the arts festival, 
to make it an officially sanctioned and funded part of the city's cultural 
life. As someone who has chaired the '84, '87 and '90 festivals, I approach 
such calls with caution. I would never wish to lose the lean-and-mean approach 
that constant lack of funding has forced on us. Nor would I ever want to lose 
our passion and the devotion of 1,100 volunteers, the daily miracles performed 
by 50 staffers, the indefatigable services of our volunteer board of directors 
and the unbridled courage of the Open Festival. 
</P>
<P>
It is accessibility -- both geographic and economic -- to the arts in Los 
Angeles that should be institutionalized, not a cultural seniority system. The 
Los Angeles Festival is not about a building or paying homage to patrons. 
Rather, it is a model to be replicated throughout the country, a spirit to be 
carried forward. 
</P>
<P>
I remember a conversation I had with Sellars in 1987. He told me the message of 
the 1990 Los Angeles Festival would be a simple one: to encourage this diverse 
community to get to know itself as it moves into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The message has been received.

PUTTING CALIFORNIA BACK ON ENERGY-EFFICIENCY TRACK: A TORTUOUS STORY; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL FIGHTS IT OUT WITH THE BIG 
FOUR UTILITIES AND THE PUC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jill Stewart, Jill Stewart is a reporter for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a far-reaching 
array of programs that give consumers and the Big Four utility companies 
incentives to conserve energy. But it took a battle royal to get it done, with 
the Natural Resources Defense Council, the utilities and the commissioners 
fighting it out. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year, $560-million program doesn't require citizens to turn down the 
heat or forgo the dishwasher. Its remedies for energy gorging will rely on 
proven construction techniques, efficient factory motors, retrofitting 
California's drafty and poorly insulated homes, sunlight-controlling window 
glass, fluorescent bulbs that don't flicker and a range of other long-ignored 
methods and devices whose aggressive use could save consumers many billions of 
dollars between now and the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers will get rebates for embracing the innovations. In most cases, the 
products will pay for themselves in two or three years of significantly reduced 
energy bills. Renters, homeowners and building owners can then look forward to 
permanently lower bills. Utilities will be allowed to keep part of that savings 
as profit, a reward for enticing consumers to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, California led the nation in pursuing energy efficiency. 
Five years later, it had a competitive edge over states whose industries had 
stayed inefficient. Although we retain some of that edge due to permanent 
installations of conservation equipment, California is in a slide. Starting in 
1985, utilities began quietly slashing their consumer rebate programs and 
promotional efforts that had popularized energy efficiency. According to the 
NRDC, when conservation programs began to disappear, energy waste skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
No politicians in Sacramento led the call for a turnaround, since energy 
efficiency is not a sexy issue. While the utilities were arguably failing to 
build on gains made in the '80s, politicians were getting headlines by focusing 
on such issues as the 1987 tax rebate. Today, politicians are howling about the 
steep increase in a gallon of gas, another issue they can snarl over, change 
nothing and come off as good guys. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Californians have needlessly been burning up more of their disposable 
income on utility bills than has been snatched away at the gas pump. While 
politicians whine about our overextended pocketbooks, few seem to care that 
every state taxpayer has already spent his or her 1987 rebate, several times 
over, on pointless energy waste in the home and workplace. According to the 
NRDC, California consumers are throwing away about $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the problem, a good place to start is with the state's Big Four 
utilities -- Southern California Edison Co., Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Gas Co. Each is 
issuing statements to take credit for the sweeping energy-efficiency programs 
approved by the PUC in late August. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, environmental critics charge, the utilities would still be promoting 
increased energy use had the NRDC not embarrassed them on the front pages of 
California newspapers last year. 
</P>
<P>
When accused of fueling a new era of waste, utility executives insisted energy 
had become so cheap that consumers would not save money by installing 
state-of-the-art motors in factories, office-tower lighting systems that slash 
bills by 50% or extensive insulation in drafty homes. Such actions, they 
claimed, were just not cost-effective in an era of cheap energy. 
</P>
<P>
But energy-efficiency experts claimed to have caught the utilities in a bit of 
a lie. Conservation proponents trotted out one of their most prominent experts, 
Amory Lovins, director of the Rocky Mountain Institute. The institute employs 
about 24 people dedicated to conservation research. The whole place -- complete 
with computers and Xerox machines -- generates energy bills of just $5 per 
month. Lovins gets a big kick out of explaining that the alterations made to 
his mountain complex paid for themselves through dramatically lower energy 
bills in just one year -- as he explained last year to the PUC members. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, Lovins has pointed out, the utility executives knew what he has known 
all these years. Yet, according to the NRDC, the utilities were laying off top 
talent in their conservation programs while bolstering their marketing staff, 
which specializes in finding ways to sell more energy. One obvious explanation 
is that these executives were after profits. The apparent truth, conservation 
advocates say, is something else. 
</P>
<P>
In an arrangement unique to California, the PUC decided several years ago to 
decouple the utilities' profits from the amount of energy they sold. The idea 
was to guarantee the utilities a profit, regardless of how much energy was or 
wasn't used by consumers, so that the utility companies wouldn't make policy 
decisions based on the demands of their stockholders, who, critics charge, put 
profits before consumers. 
</P>
<P>
But something went wrong. As energy prices eased and energy became more 
plentiful in the mid-1980s, the utilities, some critics charge, began dreaming 
up new ways to sell more energy -- even as conservation efforts were scaled 
back. Ralph Cavanagh, the mind behind the NRDC's victory, theorizes that the 
Big Four executives equated idle generating capacity with economic decline and 
powerlessness. These highly competitive people simply could not stand the 
emotional letdown of running an industry whose best possible goal is to shrink, 
not to grow. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities attributed their decisions to waning interest in conservation 
among consumers. One executive explained that "social engineering" was not an 
appropriate activity for utilities. But Howard P. Allen, outgoing chairman and 
president of Southern California Edison, conceded that mistakes were made, 
saying, "How do you motivate Joe Sixpack when it's not one of his higher 
priorities? . . . The utilities and regulators have not done as much as we 
should, as good as we should. Well, we're like Joe Sixpack." 
</P>
<P>
As David Morse, a spokesman for the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates, 
complained last year, the utilities, given their guaranteed profits, should not 
have needed any further monetary incentives "to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
This is something to remember as the the four utilities embark upon the most 
sweeping energy conservation program undertaken in the nation.

DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS AT LOS ANGELES ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While reading "Clean Up Act, L.A. Zoo Told" (Part B, Sept. 13), I experienced 
deja vu. I truly thought I was seeing another article about a slumlord. 
</P>
<P>
The animals at the zoo are unable to complain. They, as "tenants," have had 
their rights violated. We have taken them out of their natural environments and 
caged them for our enjoyment. We have entrusted their care to Warren Thomas, 
zoo director, who should have been aware when these slovenly conditions started 
to appear and should never have let them continue. Instead, he is passing the 
buck by blaming "middle-level employees for failing to inform him" of the 
problems. Everyone is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Some slumlords have had fines imposed on them and were sentenced to live in the 
hovels they allowed their tenants to exist in. Perhaps Thomas, besides paying 
the fines, should reside for at least a week in one of the, and I quote the 
Humane Society, "deplorably barren and sadly outdated compounds." His meals 
should be some of the food that was stored improperly.

DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS AT LOS ANGELES ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. believes The Times was right on target in its 
editorial ("Wanted: A Zoo, Not a Pigsty," Sept. 15) calling for a fresh 
approach to the management of the zoo. This seems a viable solution to the 
chronic problems of the sort that came to light and will continue to plague the 
zoo operations under the current administrative setup. 
</P>
<P>
Our organization, a nonprofit association made up of some 135,000 volunteers 
and an administrative staff of 47 professionals, also supports Mayor Tom 
Bradley and Councilmen John Ferraro and Joel Wachs in their demands for an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
GLAZA, which is responsible for the zoo's animal acquisitions, fund-raising, 
concessions, membership, capital improvement projects, and conservation, 
educational and public support programs, has been frustrated for some time by 
the arrangement under which the zoo is now run. Under the city's current 
system, coordination between GLAZA, the zoo director and the city's Recreation 
and Parks Department, which oversees the zoo's housekeeping functions, is very 
difficult. This dissipates the strength and frustrates the goals of all 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
We have thoroughly researched and long advocated an approach such as The Times 
suggests, with management "transferred from Recreation and Parks to a private 
nonprofit zoological society like the one that runs the Bronx Zoo in New York 
and the San Diego Zoo." 
</P>
<P>
The great zoos of the world today are vastly different from their counterparts 
of a generation ago. Animals are treated more humanely and with greater regard 
for their needs. They are housed in habitats more closely resembling their 
natural state. The emphasis is less on entertainment and more on informing 
people about their world and natural environment in ways no book or classroom 
can.

AS OKLAHOMA GOES, SO GOES. . .?; 
</P>
<P>
TERM LIMITATIONS COULD PRODUCE A NEAR-REVOLUTION IN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen years ago California voters passed Proposition 13, the property 
tax-limitation initiative, setting in motion a taxpayer revolt that swept 
across the country. Now, Oklahoma voters, by a 2-1 margin, have made their 
state the first to limit the number of years a legislator may serve. Such 
measures will be prominent on the November ballots in Colorado and California. 
Is the Oklahoma vote an omen of things to come? 
</P>
<P>
Political opinion on that is typically divided. In California, opponents of the 
two initiatives to limit terms of state officeholders say they doubt that the 
Oklahoma vote will significantly influence opinion. Supporters of the measures, 
not surprisingly, see it as reinforcing a swelling sense that term limitation 
is an idea whose time has come. Probably all would agree with California Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), an opponent of term limits, 
who acknowledges the national dimensions of the limitation movement. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is more calculated to make a professional politician's blood run cold 
than the prospect of being limited by law, and not just voter preference, to a 
finite term of service. But it's not just politicians who recoil from term 
limitation measures. Many see any abridgement of voters' rights to reelect 
officeholders as many times as they want as a blow to democratic principle. Of 
course, if voters themselves freely choose to abridge that right, the argument 
becomes moot. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma measure, to take effect Jan. 1, limits an individual's lifetime 
service in the state Legislature to 12 years. California's Propositions 131 and 
140, though they conflict to some degree, would among other things set term 
limits for nearly all state elective offices, in the Legislature and in the 
Executive Branch. 
</P>
<P>
Does this week's vote in Oklahoma presage a more sweeping approach in 
California? We'll know on Nov. 6, when voters make decisions that could produce 
a near-revolutionary transformation of the state's political landscape.

WINNING WITH A SHOCK TO THE BODY POLITIC; 
</P>
<P>
MASSACHUSETTS RESPONDED TO JOHN SILBER'S CANDOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Journalists often are the last to learn what is happening, even after it has 
happened. The morning after John Silber won the Democratic nomination to be 
Massachusetts' governor, the Washington Post said, "Silber gave a voice to the 
more conservative and disaffected Democrats but wounded himself repeatedly 
through a series of intemperate remarks." 
</P>
<P>
Right. Wounded himself to victory. "Self-immolation" was a Boston press 
description of Silber as he rose from a late start, and dead last, to a 
landslide victory. 
</P>
<P>
Silber, 63 and on leave as Boston University's president, has a mind full of 
sandpapery opinions and a barbed tongue with which he speaks his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting "shocker" was his his call for the elderly to get on with 
dying so government can get on with balancing the budget. Of course he said no 
such thing, but a lot of people had fun pretending he did. 
</P>
<P>
During a discussion of health-care financing and terminal illness Silber said, 
"Shakespeare was right when he said 'Ripeness is all.' When you've had a long 
life and you're ripe, then it's time to go." His quotation from "King Lear" 
occurred in the context of facts like these: 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts $250,000 or more may be spent on futile medical procedures for 
someone terminally ill, yet there is insufficient money for detoxification of 
pregnant women addicted to cocaine or alcohol. (The public cost per affected 
child: more than $200,000 before kindergarten.) Poor children are contracting 
polio, whooping cough and measles because there is not enough money for 
inoculations. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, said Silber, society's resources are not being allocated properly; the 
low-income elderly might like less of society's finite resources devoted to 
heroic measures for the terminally ill and more to eyeglasses, hearing aids, 
dentures and prescription drugs. Silber's opponent said: "Silber wants to 
ration health care for the elderly." 
</P>
<P>
Silber responded that medical care is always rationed, to some extent, by 
limitations on resources and by price. And when children are dying of 
preventable diseases two miles from where millions are being spent on futile 
measures for the terminally ill, that, too, is a form of rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Silber's problem, if such it is, is that he, a former professor of philosophy, 
has the habits of a professor. "Typically, I put forward a statement for 
examination and then develop evidence and argument toward a conclusion. In the 
context of a political campaign, I've discovered that the first thing one says 
-- and often it is said to attract attention -- is taken as the sound bite and 
the definitive position of the candidate on a subject. If the candidate makes 
any effort to enlarge upon that sound bite, he is then accused of having 
changed his position." 
</P>
<P>
By the way, the "intemperate" Silber got 55% of the elderly vote. 
</P>
<P>
Silber is a conservative Democrat. Both the adjective and the noun are correct. 
</P>
<P>
As a Democrat he believes in strong, interventionist government. In the context 
of the enveloping urban crisis, he particularly favors early intervention in 
the lives of poor children. 
</P>
<P>
As a conservative he is offended by the policies and vanities that have made 
Massachusetts a byword for mismanagement. And the intervention he favors -- as 
with public education, particularly for the poor -- is a conservative's 
response to the breakdown of civility and order. 
</P>
<P>
But the importance of his candidacy is not just that he is resuscitating an 
honorable persuasion that is no longer adequately represented in the Democratic 
Party. His candidacy also is important in vindicating the practicality of 
campaigning with edge, bite and mind. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to enforce blandness in general, and squishy liberal consensus in 
particular, achieved its greatest success with the Senate's rejection of Robert 
Bork, a former professor with temperamental as well as ideological similarities 
to Silber. 
</P>
<P>
The confirmation hearings for DavidSouter were instructive about the 
consequences of blandification. Souter, a complex and intellectually subtle 
man, strove to seem less so than he is, in order that he more closely resemble 
the members of the Judiciary Committee. Very prudent. 
</P>
<P>
The uncomprehending media are convinced that Silber was "wounded" by the 
attributes that helped him win. The media probably are unaware that they are 
making an ideological pronouncement when they describe Silber's (and, it seems 
the voters') ideas as "intemperate." The public likes much of what he says and, 
even more, likes a candidate who says things that cause queasiness among the 
blandness-enforcers.

CUOMO'S NOT AFRAID OF WILLIE HORTON;

PEOPLE AND THEIR FEARS DON'T GET SCORN FROM THIS GOVERNOR.

<P>
Mario Cuomo must have shuddered at the electoral punishment handed Michael 
Dukakis in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Dukakis sat across the table from Cuomo in Albany and laid out 
his optimistic plan to seek the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
It was a no-lose proposition. If he did not make it to the White House, Dukakis 
could always return to the job he and Cuomo both love, that of governing an 
exciting, culturally diverse, Democratic state. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Bay State citizens returned their verdict on Dukakis' fallback 
career strategy. Democratic primary voters rejected every name on the ballot 
even remotely connected with the lame-duck governor. They chose instead as 
their candidate for governor Boston University President John Silber, a 
maverick running against the Dukakis legacy. 
</P>
<P>
This public execution of his fellow Democrat may cause the New York governor to 
rethink the run for the presidency he is considering. It shouldn't. To 
paraphrase a line from the 1988 campaign, I know Michael Dukakis, governor. I 
covered Michael Dukakis, and you, Mario Cuomo, are no Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Not to put too fine a point on it, the departing governor of Massachusetts is 
an elitist. He believes in government by the Best and the Brightest and counts 
himself at the top of that category. 
</P>
<P>
Such arrogance is a hard sell even in boom times. When the economy takes a deep 
dip, as it has here in New England, people wonder what all the bragging was 
about. They look at the smug fellow who marketed himself nationwide as the 
"Massachusetts miracle" man and wonder if he misplaced his magic wand 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get this straight: It wasn't liberalism that killed Michael Dukakis. It 
wasn't his belief in government, his compassion for the poor and elderly, or 
his support for First Amendment liberties. It was the arrogance he displayed, 
not just here at home but in his embarrassing run for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Willie Horton. 
</P>
<P>
When Tennessee Sen. Al Gore, a Democrat, introduced the Massachusetts prison 
"furlough" issue in the 1988 primary, Dukakis treated the question as an 
impertinence. His wet-behind-the-ears rival obviously didn't understand how a 
"modern criminal justice system" was run. 
</P>
<P>
When George Bush picked up the attack, asking why anyone would let a murderer 
like Willie Horton loose for the weekend, Michael Dukakis refused to admit 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
It got worse. Instead of saying that the people were right to worry about 
killer-rapists like Horton, Dukakis smugly insinuated that the real menace was 
the small-minded, possibly racist views of those who spent their time 
hand-wringing over the Willie Horton case. 
</P>
<P>
The arrogance was palpable: Here was this swell-educated guy from Harvard Law, 
living in a nice, safe suburb telling the country's cabdrivers and night-shift 
factory workers that he didn't really want to hear their feelings and fears. 
</P>
<P>
Case No. 2: The "Pledge of Allegiance" issue. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Dukakis displayed the same brand of contempt toward the voters. It's one 
thing to defend the rights of teachers to resist leading their classes in the 
pledge. It's another to ignore, as Dukakis did, the deeply felt passions of 
those who disagree with his position. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to reach out to voters who believe in such rituals, Dukakis 
and his people treated the issue as a crude appeal to the great unwashed. He 
never accepted the fact that what he was being accused of was not treason but 
disdain. 
</P>
<P>
Should the Democratic governor of New York avoid a presidential run out of fear 
for the same fate? I don't think so. Cuomo may have vulnerabilities in a 
contest with George Bush, but they would not be the same as Dukakis'. 
</P>
<P>
Would Mario Cuomo look down his nose at people worried about crime? Hardly. The 
governor of New York keeps a baseball bat under his bed out of personal respect 
for the same well-grounded fears. 
</P>
<P>
Would Cuomo be vulnerable on the crime issue? Certainly. But the crime 
statistics in New York are at the same flood-level as those in Washington and 
elsewhere in George Bush's America. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not forget, it was not the crime rate in Massachusetts that cost Michael 
Dukakis in 1988. It was his condescending attitude toward those worried about 
crime -- which he capped with an iceman's indifference when asked what he'd do 
if someone raped and killed his wife. 
</P>
<P>
I would not expect Mario Cuomo, who raised a family of daughters on the streets 
of Queens, to give the same answer. Nor would I expect Mario Cuomo to respond 
to an attack on his patriotism by thumbing through a law book. He'd more likely 
reach for that bat he keeps under his bed.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE PERSIAN GULF; 
</P>
<P>
BEWARE TIMIDITY IN THE ENDGAME; 
</P>
<P>
IT IS LIGHTLY STATED THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE ISOLATED IN A MILITARY 
CRUNCH. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY A. KISSINGER, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger writes 
often for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the initial deployment of U.S. forces to the skillful weaving of 
international support, the Bush Administration's management of the Persian Gulf 
crisis has been flawless. But foreign policy is remembered for its endgames. 
</P>
<P>
For economic and political reasons, I doubt a stalemate can be sustained, 
either by our associates or by the United States. The rise in oil prices has 
already reduced growth projections in the industrial democracies by 1% and 
greatly increased the danger of inflation. No one can know at what oil price 
support for sanctions would erode. But it would be reckless to ignore the 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
On the political front, a prolonged stalemate is likely to undermine the 
domestic stability of our Arab associates. Large numbers of foreign forces on 
Saudi soil -- however well-meaning -- must be grating to a population carefully 
shielded heretofore from contact with the outside world. Radical propaganda 
labeling foreigners as occupiers will become increasingly plausible. Harassment 
and sabotage will increase. 
</P>
<P>
The same factor that led to the rapid U.S. deployment -- the need to sustain 
moderate governments in the gulf -- makes it imperative to create the right 
conditions for an equally rapid withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The key decision before the Administration is thus to define what constitutes a 
tolerable outcome. But this is muddled in the current debate, which treats 
diplomacy as a self-contained exercise equated with compromise and with saving 
the other side's face. These slogans, drawn from the experience of a society 
that has rarely known irreconcilable differences, are irrelevant to Saddam 
Hussein's Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's use of hostages, for example, is without precedent. When hostages were 
first taken two decades ago, the culprits were outlaw groups unavowed even by 
governments that encouraged them. Terrorism then evolved into tacit government 
support targeted mostly on government personnel. Hussein has now escalated it 
to a head of state taking action against thousands of innocent civilians from 
all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
In these circumstances, saving Iraq's face is the exact opposite of what is 
needed. For it would enable Hussein to claim some gain from his aggression, 
while the goal of gulf strategy must be to demonstrate its failure. 
</P>
<P>
The test of that demonstration will be how the outcome is perceived by actual 
or potential victims. Early on, there was some argument over whether U.S. vital 
interests justified the deployment in the gulf. That debate has since been 
overtaken by the scale of our deployment and the number of countries that have 
followed U.S. leadership. 
</P>
<P>
This international support can only be due to two factors: The other nations 
either agree with the United States about the need to stop Iraqi aggression; or 
they consider whatever reservations they have outweighed by their need for 
America's long-term support. The perception of U.S. failure would therefore 
shake international stability. Every moderate country in the Middle East would 
be gravely weakened. Egypt, Morocco and even Turkey would face a tide of 
radicalism and fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is right in insisting that no compromise of the U.N. resolutions 
-- Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, the unconditional release of 
all hostages and the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government -- is 
possible. Any modification would amount to an Iraqi gain and a defeat for the 
United States and its associates. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to keep this in mind in view of the facile argument that the 
United States must not run risks on behalf of the emir of Kuwait. By insisting 
on a restoration of pre-invasion conditions, neither the United Nations nor the 
United States is passing judgment on the emir's qualities. They are asserting 
that the most repressive regime in the region does not have the right to sit in 
judgment over the domestic legitimacy of its neighbors. Of course, these 
traditional governments will, in time, change. But their evolution should be 
guided by their own dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. terms, in one respect, already represent a compromise with what is 
needed for peace and with what is compatible with the massive international 
deployment. Were Hussein suddenly to accept them, he would preserve the essence 
of his power, although it would represent a huge loss of prestige for him. It 
might even bring home the need for a more moderate Iraqi leadership -- 
especially if Hussein were replaced as a consequence. 
</P>
<P>
But this could easily turn out to be wishful thinking. The strategic 
relationship that encouraged Iraqi aggression would remain. Iraq would retain 
its chemical and nuclear capabilities. Iraq's large standing army would 
preserve its capacity to overwhelm the area. Reducing Iraq's disproportionate 
military capacity is especially important if U.S. forces are to be withdrawn 
rapidly, as I believe they should be. 
</P>
<P>
To think that the area can be protected by multilateral security treaties is a 
fantasy. The experience of the defunct Baghdad pact and of the Southeast Asian 
Treaty Organization shows the fragility of multilateral arrangements in regions 
where the nations involved have no coherent objectives or means of mutual 
support and frequently shift allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, it would be undesirable to reduce Iraq's armed forces below what 
is needed to maintain equilibrium with its neighbors, especially in light of 
their demonstrably low threshold of resistance to the temptations of a military 
vacuum. The democracies' support for Iraq during the war with Iran was a 
reflection of their commitment to Iraq's territorial integrity. What they are 
resisting now is having their economies and their peace held at ransom by a 
megalomaniacal ruler. 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons, I would feel more comfortable if the United States 
sought to strengthen the U.N. resolutions by insisting on internationally 
monitored reductions of Iraq's military capabilities. But were Hussein to yield 
to sanctions without war, Bush might well decide that he could not go beyond 
the existing U.N. resolutions, without which the sanctions would never have 
been implemented. Such an outcome would be as understandable as it would be 
precarious. It must be entered into -- if at all -- with the knowledge that it 
would require a much higher degree of continued vigilance and a larger U.S. 
presence in the area than is desirable. If a military clash occurs, the United 
States should seek an outcome more consistent with long-term stability. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration must therefore decide how long it is prepared to wait for 
sanctions to work and how far it is prepared to go without unanimous 
international support. I do not know whether the decision must be made in 
October or November. I would be very uneasy were it to be delayed into the new 
year, for I believe the entire enterprise might then begin to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
It is lightly stated that the United States would be isolated in a military 
crunch. I do not believe this. The moderate Arab states would welcome a 
decisive U.S. move if it were demonstrably the only alternative to Hussein's 
succeeding. As for our allies, conditions are unusually favorable for a U.S. 
initiative. In short, the United States is not likely to find itself isolated 
were it to decide, after an appropriate testing period, that sanctions are not 
working; indeed, the most likely road to isolation is by way of a protracted 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In the flush of rediscovered multilateralism, the United States must not 
subordinate all long-range policy to the heady glow of internationalism or to 
the tactics of the moment. Even though I have consistently urged the inclusion 
of Syria in the Middle East peace process, I cannot repress my uneasiness at 
the eagerness with which the United States welcomed the movement of a Syrian 
armored division to Saudi Arabia. Do we know how to make it leave? 
</P>
<P>
In overcoming the current crisis, the United States must not emerge as the 
permanent defender of every status quo. But the path to peace and progress 
resides in success in the gulf. Afterward, the United States, together with its 
Arab partners, can demonstrate the benefits of cooperative action in promoting 
the well-being of the Arab peoples. Also, it should energetically seek to make 
progress toward a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, especially now that 
looming disaster might have brought all sides second thoughts about the nature 
of a peace and suitable participants in peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes platitudes turn out to be true. This is the test of the post-Cold War 
era. It remains for the Administration to reap the benefits of its courageous 
efforts.

Wild Goose Chase -- Two articles in the newly published third volume of the 
"Memoirs of the Natural History Foundation of Orange County" focus on Quail 
Hill in Irvine, the only spot in the county where Canada geese winter. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the geese can be spotted from the San Diego Freeway, feeding on the 
grassy knoll south of the freeway and west of Sand Canyon Avenue. The migratory 
waterfowl also use the nearby Sand Canyon Reservoir, which is not open to the 
public, for night resting and some foraging. 
</P>
<P>
The year 1988 was a good one for the geese: Quail Hill and lands adjacent to 
the reservoir were protected as part of the city's Open Space Plan; also, the 
population of wintering Canada geese at Quail Hill peaked that year at 4,150, 
the highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
Unexpectedly, however, numbers dwindled in 1989 to 1,350. Theories ranged from 
the loss of other nearby habitats to urban development to altered migration 
patterns caused by climatic or habitat changes along the route. The Canada 
goose is not endangered, but its numbers are dwindling along California's 
coastal slope. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle grazing in the area appears to have mixed effects on the geese. On the 
plus side, grazing encourages weedy species such as filaree, which is 
apparently one of the features drawing geese to the site; on the other hand, 
cattle grazing encourages the spread of non-native artichoke thistle. The geese 
do not seem bothered by the actual presence of the cattle. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the local wintering population of geese in the coming winter 
remains to be seen; the birds are due to begin arriving in early to 
mid-November, with numbers peaking in January and February and declining 
through March. 
</P>
<P>
Help Wanted -- The Museum of Natural History and Science is still seeking 
volunteer docents for its new interim location in Aliso Viejo, now due to open 
in December. The museum will be training volunteers in the coming months; for 
information, call (714) 640-7120.

BANKS AT THE BARRICADES; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: THE INDUSTRY IS BEING ASSAULTED ON ALL SIDES. THE RESULT IS THAT THE 
NUMBER OF DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY -- AND THE TREND MAY

<P>
U.S. banks are under siege at home and abroad in what is resembling an 
Alamo-like battle. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in just six months has become the nation's 
sixth-largest issuer of MasterCard and Visa credit cards. Sears, Roebuck &amp; 
Co. has issued nearly 36 million Discover cards in the United States, more 
credit cards than any bank has ever issued domestically. General Motors, 
through a Utah affiliate, is offering government-insured certificates of 
deposit, just like a bank. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you haven't driven a Ford lately, you may well have banked with the 
company. The nation's second-largest auto maker also is the nation's 
second-largest bank -- if you stretch the definition. The $119 billion in 
assets in Ford's savings and loan, car financing, leasing and credit card 
operations as of June 30 would rank second in size as a bank only to Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
Competition is even tougher overseas. Some 41 cents of every dollar held by the 
world's 100 largest banks were in Japanese institutions at the end of last 
year, double the amount 15 years ago. By comparison, only 11 cents of every 
dollar is in a U.S. bank, one-third of what they held in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. banks once were the world's largest. Now only Citicorp makes the world's 
top 20 in size, and only four domestic banks make the top 50. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of competitiveness, broadly defined, is becoming an increasingly 
serious problem both in the U.S. and for U.S. banks abroad," said BankAmerica 
Corp. Vice Chairman Lewis W. Coleman. "It's a serious, big-picture problem." 
</P>
<P>
The assaults on U.S. banking couldn't come at a worse time. Hurt by bad foreign 
loans, growing problems with real estate borrowers and shaky lending to finance 
corporate buyouts, many of the largest banks have little room for error. Last 
week, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke issued an ominous note 
when he predicted that banks, especially on the East Coast, will experience 
even more real estate woes. 
</P>
<P>
Even a Federal Reserve Board decision Thursday allowing the limited offering of 
securities by New York banking giant J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. is not expected to 
provide immediate help in making banks more competitive. Few banks are as 
strong as Morgan, so most, for now, will not be able to take immediate 
advantage of expanded powers. Besides, the securities business itself is in a 
severe slump. 
</P>
<P>
Many large banks are skating on thin layers of capital, the financial safety 
nets that they maintain to absorb losses. With a recession lurking, profits are 
expected to be weak this year. 
</P>
<P>
No one is saying that banks are in a permanent decline. But the combination of 
their growing problems and increased competition at home and overseas doesn't 
bode well. Some 1,000 banks have disappeared the past two years through mergers 
and buyouts, and an additional 427 have failed. The 192 banks that received 
charters last year represented the lowest number in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Banking executives believe that a shakeout of the weakest banks is needed to 
help the industry recover, with the list of survivors dominated by regional 
banks with strong retail branch networks. 
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, some believe, as many as 3,000 to 5,000 banks will 
disappear through failures or mergers from among the 12,700 institutions 
operating at the end of 1989. Bank executives expect one or more of the 
nation's huge "money center" institutions to disappear through a merger because 
of the pressure to build capital. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most troubled money center banks is Chase Manhattan Corp. The 
nation's second-largest banking firm said Friday that it will have to slash 
costs by $300 million a year and that it expects to post a $625-million loss in 
its third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Banks' long-term problems can be broadly defined in three areas. 
</P>
<P>
First, too many banks are chasing too few good lending opportunities. Second, 
an array of regulations, some dating to the 1920s, make U.S. banking 
inefficient and less competitive. And third, the cost of raising badly needed 
capital is expensive for banks, relative to what it costs their non-bank 
competitors and foreign institutions. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that all banks are doing poorly. Some regional banks are 
doing well, mainly because they have maintained strong balance sheets, 
scrutinized borrowers closely and developed franchises aimed at consumer 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Especially strong are such regional banks as Banc One in Ohio, First Wachovia 
and NCNB Corp. in North Carolina, NBD Bancorp Inc. in Detroit and CoreStates 
Financial Corp. in Philadelphia. In California, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and 
BankAmerica, both in San Francisco, and Los Angeles-based Security Pacific 
Corp. have outperformed most banks nationwide, although concerns are rising 
about their vulnerability to a softening real estate market and deteriorating 
corporate buyout loans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the regional bright spots, overall nervousness is increasing, however. 
</P>
<P>
Alarms are going off in Washington -- where politicians are seething from the 
thrift debacle -- as concerns grow that the nation's deposit insurance fund may 
not be big enough to protect taxpayers should some of the nation's weaker banks 
fail. Rating agencies are regularly downgrading banks. Investors shun bank 
stocks, making it harder for institutions to raise much needed capital. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller number of good lending opportunities can be blamed for some of the 
banking industry's malaise. Corporate customers, once the mainstay of bank 
borrowers, increasingly bypass banks by issuing IOUs in the form of commercial 
paper to raise money. Four of 10 people who buy a General Motors car or truck 
this year will finance it through GM. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, banks searching for lending opportunities have been forced to make 
riskier loans and give borrowers easier terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Banks have been precluded in their ability to expand geographically and in 
terms of products. As certain markets have been taken away, they've gone to 
other markets," said Security Pacific Chief Executive Robert H. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, much of that opportunity was in real estate. Many believe that 
the reason so many banks went into it is in part because of the lack of 
opportunities elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Also to make money, banks have increasingly turned to consumer lending -- such 
as home loans, home equity loans and credit cards -- which can be highly 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
But some worry that there are already too many banking and non-banking players 
in those businesses, inviting trouble by making home equity loans or credit 
cards too easy to get. A nationwide recession and further job layoffs would not 
only slow consumer borrowing but also increase problem consumer loans. 
</P>
<P>
An overabundance of domestic banks has made the nation's banking system 
inefficient, weakening U.S. banks as global competitors. Foreign institutions 
are not burdened with the same splintered system. 
</P>
<P>
There are 53 banks per 1 million people in the United States. That compares to 
11 per million in Great Britain, five per million in West Germany, three per 
million in Canada and one per million in Japan. Indeed, if the United States 
had the same number of banks per capita as Europe does, there would be only 700 
banking firms, instead of the 10,000 now that own the nation's nearly 13,000 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the global ambitions of many U.S. banks have been shelved. Few 
American banks are in a position, for example, to take advantage of the 
financing boom expected in Europe after its economic integration in 1992. They 
have yielded the market to such European giants as Germany's Deutsche Bank. 
Making it even more difficult for U.S. banks to penetrate Europe is the fact 
that many institutions there have ownership ties with corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"To compete in Germany with German banks would be impossible," Security 
Pacific's Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the nation's banking policies say laws and regulations discourage 
the squeezing out of weak banks from the industry. Some of that stems from the 
government's decision to save Chicago-based Continental Illinois in 1984 and 
the clear policy of federal regulators that some banks are too big to allow to 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
"We not only protect mediocrity, we then turn around and insure it with 
taxpayers' money," BankAmerica's Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Regulations also promote inefficiencies as well. State and federal laws, some 
of which date to the 1920s, make it unwieldy to cross state lines and restrict 
the kind of products that can be offered in branches. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are increasingly being allowed to cross state lines, such as through the 
easing of California's interstate banking laws next year. In theory, this 
allows a bank to spread its risk across different geographic areas and absorb 
the shocks of regional economic downturns. 
</P>
<P>
But state and federal laws, some of which predate the Great Depression, require 
bank holding companies to set up separate banks in each state, a highly 
inefficient process as opposed to merely opening branches of the same bank in 
different states. They must have separate boards of directors and in many cases 
have no choice but to operate separate computer systems from their main ones. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, which has the nation's largest 
interstate banking network, has 232 directors in the 13 states where it owns 
banks, not counting the parent company's 16 directors. Thirty-three of those 
directors are in New Mexico, where First Interstate must maintain four separate 
boards for each bank it owns there. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are also restricted in what they can sell at branches. They ideally would 
like to offer mutual funds, insurance, stocks and real estate and other 
financial products, becoming more of a one-stop financial services center. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of banking restrictions have argued over the years that relaxing the 
rules will concentrate economic power in the hands of fewer institutions. 
Offering products such as insurance and securities could prove risky for banks, 
they argue. Interstate banking restrictions helped guarantee that local savings 
stayed close to home, they add. 
</P>
<P>
But bankers and regulators argue that the financial system is now a global one 
and that the competitor now is as much a bank in Tokyo or London as it is the 
bank across the street. Some 25% of U.S. banking assets are held by foreign 
competitors, who operate under far fewer restrictions in their home countries 
than U.S. banks do here. 
</P>
<P>
"Our banks have one hand tied behind their backs, and we've put them into the 
ring with heavyweights," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the case in Europe and Japan, U.S. regulations have set up something of 
a one-way street in the relationship between banking and commerce. In Europe 
and Japan, banks may own a chunk of a company with which they do business. In 
the United States, that is prohibited. But companies such as AT&amp;T, GM and 
Ford can easily enter banking activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Commerce can get into banking, but banking can't get into commerce," said John 
Spiegel, chief financial officer of SunTrust Banks Inc. in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Banking reform is expected to be one of the top legislative issues next year, 
when the Bush Administration proposes a series of changes. The package is 
expected to include new investment powers as a way to help domestic banks 
compete with foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
So what is ahead? 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica's Coleman sees the industry organized later this decade into two 
categories: a handful of large banks formed through mergers, and a lot of small 
local banks. Security Pacific's Smith agrees that big mergers are ahead but 
contends that it may take time. 
</P>
<P>
"The natural forces of egos probably won't let it take place rapidly. What it 
says is that it has to be driven by economic factors -- the ability to compete. 
Once someone does it, and it becomes commonplace, others will do it," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some developments are emerging that may make banks more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed decision to give J. P. Morgan limited power to underwrite stocks was a 
major chip in the 57-year-old Glass-Steagall Act, which separates banks from 
Wall Street. Bankers believe that eventually their institutions will offer 
regional investment banking services for corporations in their areas. Other 
powers may follow that would allow banks broad access to such areas as mutual 
funds, insurance and residential real estate sales, transforming the 
conventional bank branch into more of a financial services center. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks may also be less of a threat. Those institutions, which count 
unrealized stock market profits as part of their capital, now have less capital 
in the wake of the Tokyo market's decline. As a result, they may rein in their 
U.S. activities. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MasterCard and Visa are discussing limiting access to their credit 
card systems by non-banks. 
</P>
<P>
But the thrift debacle, which is expected to cost taxpayers $500 billion over 
30 years, may slow things. Congress may still have enough of a bitter taste in 
its mouth to resist increasing bank powers, even if they include protections 
for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the mood is very good. In general, it sounds like deregulation, 
and deregulation is blamed for the savings and loan mess," Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GROWING NON-BANK COMPETITION 
</P>
<P>
Banks are facing increasing competition from non-bank entities. As an example, 
the financial services-related assets of the nation's two largest auto makers 
would place them among the nation's five largest banks. 
</P>
<P>
Assets as of Dec. 31, 1989, in billions 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific: $83.9 
</P>
<P>
J.P. Morgan: $90 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica: $98.8 
</P>
<P>
GM: $103.5** 
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan: $107.4 
</P>
<P>
Ford: $115* 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp: $230.6 
</P>
<P>
* Including car financing, leasing, credit card and First Nationwide Bank 
operations 
</P>
<P>
** General Motors Acceptance Corp. activities, principally auto and mortgage 
financing.

JAMES FLANIGAN: RULES CHANGE FITS TOUGH GAME OF BANKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Reserve made headlines Thursday when, in effect, it repealed 57 
years of legislative history and gave J. P. Morgan bank permission to 
underwrite and sell common stocks and other securities. The move spelled 
curtains for the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which separated the functions of 
banks and brokerage houses because banks in the 1920s had endangered their 
depositors' money through stock deals. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fed wasn't repealing legislation so much as recognizing that the 
immense American financial services industry is now a pin-striped game of 
survival of the fittest, with everybody getting into everybody else's business. 
General Motors, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Citicorp, Merrill Lynch, 
Fidelity Investments and Aetna Life &amp; Casualty are all competing in 
consumer finance now. 
</P>
<P>
And whoever emerges the victor among them, the ultimate winner is supposed to 
be the customer -- all of us -- as we benefit from lower fees on every kind of 
loan or financing, while at the same time enjoying higher interest for our 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
The Morgan action, one small step in that long process, should be followed 
immediately by similar permissions to other large, New York banks. Ultimately 
it will spread across the country and affect every bank and brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
The banks needed a boost. They have been losing business for years to all sorts 
of competitors -- losing deposits to money market mutual funds, losing car 
loans and mortgage loans to automobile companies, losing corporate loans to 
commercial paper issued by Wall Street underwriters. 
</P>
<P>
And so they have made loans to less credit-worthy borrowers and have suffered 
growing loan losses, as dramatized by Chase Manhattan's announcement Friday of 
large layoffs and loan write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fed's action gives the banks a chance to regain some business. The Fed 
said Morgan could set up a separate securities subsidiary -- without using 
insured deposits -- and underwrite corporate stock, or bonds or commercial 
paper. It could compete, in short, with such firms as Salomon Bros., Goldman, 
Sachs &amp; Co., Merrill Lynch and, significantly, with Morgan Stanley, the 
securities firm that was separated from the Morgan bank in 1933 by the 
Glass-Steagall Act. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, the securities business is no great shakes right now. Underwriting 
is slow, there is already fierce competition and profit margins are narrowing. 
The addition of the big banks will further crowd an already-crowded market. 
</P>
<P>
And the same is true for securities trading and retail stock brokerage, which 
banks will also want to enter. In trading, the big institutional investors who 
buy and sell billions of dollars worth annually have reduced commissions to 5 
cents a share or less and are now working to bypass Wall Street altogether 
through direct computer trading. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, brokerage houses or banks vying for retail customers must compete 
with discount brokers and mutual fund companies with toll-free telephone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Note: For institutional trading, the key is using computers to cut costs; in 
retail business, the key is serving the customer by telephone. And those 
examples give you a suggestion of what the financial service business is all 
about these days: It's an electronic competition, vying for access to 
customers, in which the ultimate victor may well be the company with the 
biggest and smartest computer. 
</P>
<P>
It was a banker who saw this time coming. John Reed, now chairman of Citicorp, 
and his predecessor, Walter Wriston, started more than a decade ago building up 
Citi's computer capability and steering one of the nation's premier corporate 
lenders toward a future in consumer business. Citicorp now makes more consumer 
loans than business loans, and has become the nation's largest bank issuer of 
MasterCard and Visa cards -- a business it can handle because of its computer 
network. 
</P>
<P>
But being the largest bank issuer of credit cards is not the distinction it 
once might have been because the credit card competitors, Sears and American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, are putting Citi's effort in the shade. Sears has 
issued 36 million Discover cards and AT&amp;T is coming on very strong with a 
credit card issued only this year. 
</P>
<P>
So enraged was Citi when AT&amp;T came out with its credit card that it and 
three other big banks, including BankAmerica, filed complaints in May with the 
Federal Reserve and the Federal Communicatons Commission to try to block the 
telephone company's card. But legal experts said that there was little the 
banks could do to keep the telephone company out of their business -- and the 
AT&amp;T card continues to be a success. 
</P>
<P>
But consider the astounding contrast between that dispute and last week's 
action by the Fed. The Glass-Steagall issue seems positively quaint, a fussy 
separation of banks and brokerage houses in Wall Street long ago, while the 
issue in 1990 is whether banks anywhere can compete with the telephone company 
in making loans to consumers. Times change, and consumers become more important 
-- and that's the point of all this competition in financial services.

WASHINGTON; 
</P>
<P>
IRAQ CONSIDERATIONS MAY CHANGE TECHNOLOGY-EXPORT BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress is trying to open doors for the sale of more U.S. computers, 
telecommunications equipment and other advanced technology overseas. 
</P>
<P>
With export regulations expiring Sept. 30 and the Cold War declared over, bills 
passed by the House and Senate remove many restrictions on the sale of U.S. 
technology that has both commercial and military applications. 
</P>
<P>
The Export Administration Reform Act (S. 2927), which the Senate passed Sept. 
13, makes it easier to export high-tech goods to Eastern Europe and sharply 
reduces the items subject to export controls. In June, the House approved a 
less restrictive bill, the Export Facilitation Act (H.R. 4635). Differences 
between them will be resolved in a conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
But final legislation may be affected by fears of Iraq, which has used Western 
technology to develop chemical weapons and ballistic missiles and to try to 
build a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate already has approved an amendment, introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.), that would expand the Defense Department's ability to block exports 
to Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria. The Pentagon can already block exports of 
sensitive technology to certain Communist-bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus of both bills is Eastern Europe and the recognition that these are 
friendly countries," said a staffer on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
"But now there is this other category of countries that are not following the 
norms on the use of chemical weapons and missile technology." 
</P>
<P>
The staffer predicted that many restrictions will be swept away. But he said 
more attention will be paid to controls over missile technology and possibly 
supercomputers, which can be used to design missiles and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Others hope to derail major provisions of what they see as a dangerous 
weakening of safeguards by contending that U.S. high-tech goods could flow more 
easily from Europe to countries such as Iraq and Libya under the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
One target will be a House provision that gives the Commerce Department 
virtually sole control over what technology goes on the export list and must be 
licensed for sale overseas. The provision restricts the role of such 
national-security agencies as the Defense Department and the Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Commerce is in the camp of the exporting industries. They're cheerleaders at 
the same time they are supposed to regulate exports," says Gary Milhollin, who 
tracks chemical, missile and nuclear weapon developments as director of the 
Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Business interests will fight attempts to retain the previous restrictions or 
impose tougher ones. Even the Senate bill "doesn't go far enough," said William 
Archey, international vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White House Opposes Federal Data Access Act 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration may be penny-wise and pound-foolish in its opposition 
to legislation to create a program that would provide a Technology Access 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
For some small business operators, just knowing where to look for federal data 
and experts is half the battle. The advantage of the legislation sponsored by 
Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.) is that it would integrate the whole 
cross-section of available federal databases and provide one point of access. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging at a recent hearing before the House Committee on Small 
Business that the proposed legislation (H.R. 4659) would be an important tool 
for making federal research available to small businesses, Raymond G. Kammer, 
deputy director of the National Institute of Standards, said it would duplicate 
programs already in existence. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important in this period of fiscal austerity that we do not spend time 
and money reinventing the wheel," he said in voicing the Administration's view. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is a long list of federal databases designed to spread the fruits 
of the government's $70 billion in annual research among the private sector. 
Among them are the Federal Research In-Progress Database and the Federal 
Applied Technology Database. The departments of Defense and Energy, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a dozen other federal offices 
operate their own databases and provide some outside access. 
</P>
<P>
"Under TAP, a business in need of technical assistance does not have to call 14 
people and wait three weeks in order to get help," said LaFalce, chairman of 
the Small Business Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not have to know the 10 different protocols needed to access 10 
different databases. And it does not need to hire a staff of 
information-retrieval experts. Under TAP, all a business needs is access to a 
personal computer and a telephone in order to have the very best technical 
expertise in the country at its fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
The bill has received enthusiastic support from the business community. 
Testifying in favor, Leo Reddy, president of the National Coalition for 
Advanced Manufacturing, said, "This bill responds to the most glaring gap in 
America's performance in the field of technology -- getting existing, 
off-the-shelf technology more rapidly into the hands of industry." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also has substantial backing in Congress. The House leadership 
voted in July to make it a lead item in a package of high-tech initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The bill has been divided into two sections. The first would authorize the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology to create a user-friendly 
database of federal experts, technologies and research projects. It has been 
attached to the bill reauthorizing the Commerce Department, which is in 
conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
The second section would allow Small Business Development Centers to provide 
grants to defray the cost of using the program or training small businesses to 
use the databases. It may be attached to the reauthorization of the Small 
Business Administration. After that, TAP's future will depend on the outcome of 
the budget summit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing Set on Changes in Franchising Rules 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled this week on franchising, which has been called the most 
dynamic business arrangement since the creation of the corporation a century 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Franchising employs more than 7.2 million workers and accounts for an estimated 
$600 billion in goods and services a year. The combined sales of franchise 
businesses now accounts for a third of all U.S. retail sales and could reach 
half by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, LaFalce of the Small Business Committee says there is a 
"surprising lack of comprehensive and accurate information about franchising." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing may cover the basic fairness of franchising agreements in 
protecting the franchisee, the adequacy of federal and state regulatory 
procedures and the operation of franchise arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"These are critical policy issues that have not been addressed in any 
comprehensive fashion by Congress since the mid-1970s," said LaFalce, who will 
hold the hearing.

MONEY TALK: IF EX-SPOUSE BUYS THE HOUSE, NO TAXES TO SELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: In a recent column, you discussed the tax consequences of selling the 
marital home after a divorce. You noted that if one spouse sells the house to 
the other, the gain received by the selling spouse is not taxable. Can you tell 
me more about this? My accountant says he is not familiar with this concept. -- 
A.E. 
</P>
<P>
A: Refer your accountant to Section 1041 of the Internal Revenue Code and its 
applicable regulations. In general, the section provides that if the marital 
home is sold "incident to the divorce," the selling spouse does not have a 
taxable gain. However, the buying spouse keeps the original tax basis of the 
home, not the increased value based on the 50% sale. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it would work. Let's say you and your wife purchased the house for 
$100,000 and it is now worth $500,000. If you were not getting a divorce and 
you sold the house, there would be a $400,000 gain which would either be taxed 
or deferred. However, if you sell your half, worth $250,000, to your ex-wife -- 
as part of the divorce settlement -- you do not have a reportable gain because 
the IRS considers the deal a gift. 
</P>
<P>
Such arrangements are typically great for the selling spouse. However, the 
buying spouse, while keeping the house, also keeps its original $100,000 
taxable basis and does not receive a stepped-up value based on the price paid 
by the selling spouse. So when the buyer goes to sell several years later, 
perhaps for $600,000, he or she then would then have a gain of $500,000 on 
which to pay taxes or defer. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, our experts say that because these deals are typically great for 
the seller and not so great for the buyer, price becomes highly negotiable. 
Generally, lawyers or tax accountants are needed to unravel the tax 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Employees Get Partial Social Security 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a longtime employee of a federal agency under the civil service 
retirement program. I do not understand a statement you made in an earlier 
column that my Social Security benefits will be reduced because I receive a 
government pension. Please explain. -- D.A.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: We are talking about what the government calls the "windfall elimination 
provision." Congress designed this program to reduce the Social Security 
benefits of government employees already receiving a public agency pension and 
only minimally enrolled in the Social Security program. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because Congress felt that government employees could unfairly profit from 
the combination of both a government pension and Social Security benefits 
intended for a private-sector employee who worked at relatively low wages 
throughout his entire career. Remember, federal government and many other 
public agency workers do not belong to Social Security. Many public workers, 
however, take second jobs or become self-employed consultants for just long 
enough to meet the minimum enrollment qualifications for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes time to retire, these workers would be eligible for the Social 
Security benefit intended for the low-wage private-sector worker. This benefit 
is weighted to give this worker a greater return on his contributions than 
other more highly paid workers receive. So, Congress passed the "windfall 
elimination provision" to put government employees' Social Security benefits 
more in line with what the nation's other workers get. 
</P>
<P>
One additional note: Although the windfall elimination provision reduces the 
Social Security benefits of a government pensioned retiree, it does not 
eliminate them. This is a marked difference from the "government pension 
offset" which can have the effect of eliminating the Social Security benefits a 
spouse would be entitled to receive if he or she were not already receiving a 
government pension. These are two separate programs with two entirely separate 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tapping Into IRA Early Is Option for Disabled 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband, age 53 1/2, was disabled five years ago and cannot return to 
work. Because of this hardship, we are running out of money, and we are 
wondering what sort of options we have. We own a house. Is there any sort of 
ruling that would allow us to sell it now and still take advantage of the 
one-time tax exemption of $125,000 of the profits? What about our individual 
retirement accounts? Is there some sort of exception that would allow my 
husband to tap into his early because of his disability? -- J.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: The rules governing the exclusion of $125,000 worth of home sale profits 
from taxation are clear. One member of a married couple must be at least age 
55; the house must be your primary residence and you must have lived there at 
least three of the last five years. No exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
As for the IRAs, it may well be possible for your husband to begin drawing on 
his accounts without incuring the 10% early withdrawal penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The key is that you must meet the definition of disabled, as set forth in Sect. 
72 (m) (7) of the Internal Revenue Code. Basically, the code requires that a 
physician certify that the disabled taxpayer be unable to work due to a medical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchase Date Dictates Stock's Value as Gift 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been purchasing stock through a company dividend reinvestment plan 
every quarter. What purchase dates should I list on my tax return when I sell 
these shares? Also, how is the value of stock that is received as a gift 
established? -- M.K.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: When selling shares purchased through a dividend reinvestment plan, simply 
list the purchase dates and values included in the dividend statement you 
receive from the company each quarter. 
</P>
<P>
These statements are quite explicit, usually listing the total monetary amount 
of your dividend, the purchase price of the company's shares as of that date, 
and the number of shares your dividend entitled you to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
This is the reason why everyone participating in dividend reinvestment programs 
should keep their quarterly dividend statements. 
</P>
<P>
The value of stock received as a gift is its value as of the date the stock was 
purchased by the donor, plus any commission fees. So, if your mother gives you 
shares she purchased in 1950 for a total of $500, the base value of the stock 
to you is still $500, even though the stock may have a current trading value of 
$5,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the stock is given to you upon the death of the owner, its value is 
that on the donor's date of death.

NO ONE'S IN THE KITCHEN WITH DINAH; 
</P>
<P>
SURRENDER THE PINK BY CARRIE FISHER (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $18.95; 269 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Deanne Stillman, Stillman is the author of several books, including the 
memoir Getting Back at Dad (Wideview). She currently is writing a Movie of the 
Week about a father-daughter reunion for Hearst Entertainment. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Surrender the Pink" is about Dinah Kaufman, soap-opera writer, human catalogue 
of one-liners, and daughter of divorce. Her painful history with an absentee 
father has rendered the grown-up Dinah a woman who gets an erotic kick out of 
the unavailable man. 
</P>
<P>
In this novel, her emotional resume is played out against her attempt to get 
back with her ex-husband, who is now not just emotionally absent but also 
geographically out of reach in a love shack on the East Coast. Of course, Dinah 
had left him in the first place. For her, once a man becomes available, the 
thrill is gone and the threat is present; she talks tough and is unable -- in 
the parlance of men's magazines -- to "surrender the pink," a phrase that 
translates as "spread your legs" or, to put it more universally, "give it up." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, in a book littered with cute epigraphs culled mostly from Zoology 
101, this particular invocation is not used once. Author Carrie Fisher (a 
Hollywood baby whose first book, "Postcards From the Edge," is now playing at a 
theater near you) seems to have reserved discussion of its meaning for 
interviews (which is where I got the news). But, as the author writes of her 
protagonist, "Dinah talks in explicit code -- it's a neurosis that ultimately 
fails." 
</P>
<P>
Which is unfortunate, because few modern writers have traveled the tricky 
turnpike of father-daughter relationships. In her zeal to be clever, Fisher 
speeds past this car wreck of Dinah's past, craning out the window just long 
enough to give us this provocative, yet far-too-faded snapshot: 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever she saw him on his once-a-year visits, she'd put on her best behavior 
so he'd love her. Because she hardly ever saw him, he grew daily in her mind, a 
paternal tumor on her imagination. She loved -- she worshiped -- the father she 
made up in her mind. The father she created in fantasy grew more intricate with 
each passing day, until finally she had created two monsters -- the father she 
had never had -- and the daughter he should never have left." 
</P>
<P>
This is a lovely passage, and no doubt, an effective movie pitch, but in a 
novel whose title is evidently some sort of mirror-writing, the reader needs to 
know exactly why the heroine is unable to show her secret side. What happened 
during those once-a-year visits? Did Dinah and her father go away for the 
afternoon? If so, where? And what about the rest of the year? Did Daddy 
remember her birthday? Were there letters? What was promised? And what was not 
delivered? 
</P>
<P>
These are important details that Fisher does not reveal directly, preferring 
instead to refract Dinah's past through witty dialogue, observations and 
soap-opera scenes. This results in a main character who is hobbled not just by 
her own vaguely outlined fears but also by a persona that parallels the 
narrator's. Dinah's "Look, Ma, I'm being witty" style of talking is not unlike 
Fisher's "Look, Ma, I'm writing" style of narrating; both are infused with a 
relentless display of knowledge and high-IQ commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, this is Fisher's strength. "Surrender the Pink" overflows with many 
memorable lines, such as "If you like people for their minds, how great can the 
sex be?"; "She felt sad and caught. Caught in the tractor beam of her 
obsession"; and this wonderful capsule of the difference between men and women: 
"Boy meets girl -- boner. Girl meets boy -- marriage, perfect life." 
</P>
<P>
These remarks are the product of a quick mind at work. Which brings me to the 
cute zoological epigraphs, also the product of quickness, and a certain 
unwillingness, or hesitation, to slow down (again, like the narrator's dilemma, 
Dinah's as well). Each section of the book is introduced by a description of 
the mating ritual of various creatures, including the sparrow, fish, polecat, 
spider, bat and hippo. Within the novel itself, reference is made to the 
training of homing pigeons, and the mating habits of swans, wolves and black 
widow spiders. Any of these members of God's Kingdom, preferably a vertebrate, 
could have served as the single metaphor for Dinah and her activity with the 
opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
But the passages could just as easily have been excised. For they really serve 
no purpose other than to build to the final epigraph. Fisher rings down the 
curtain with a statement that is guaranteed to get a knowing laugh from the 
crowd that's so vain it probably thinks this book is about them: "The female 
human being, given a certain unseemly interpretation of her childhood, specific 
to the absence of the male parent, will tend to fixate on unavailable males in 
her maturity . . . some recover by mating with friends and learning to 'love' 
them. The rest remain fairly successful in daytime television." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the result of a malfunctioning father-daughter relationship is 
an unwitting Bartleby the Scrivener, a character who likes neither her work nor 
her life, who might as well be toiling at the dead-letter desk in the post 
office. Since she is driven not by passion or desire, Dinah Kaufman is fueled 
instead by personality tics. When those can no longer propel the novel, the 
author resorts to such devices as the writers' strike of 1988, which provides 
the idle time for Dinah to run after her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate that Fisher the actress was unable to tell Fisher the writer 
that a character cannot possibly be motivated in such ways. And evidently 
editors, who may be going the way of the ozone layer, were unable to bridge the 
gap. So what the reader gets is a novel that surrenders no colors of the 
behavioral spectrum -- just jokes, interesting asides and evocative vignettes. 
</P>
<P>
If only Dinah had been permitted to escape the tomb of her mind, to flash just 
the tiniest bit of her secret self, even if she then closed forever like a 
cold-water clam! At least the reader would have known why Dinah is sealed by 
her fate, would have seen her struggle to overcome it. 
</P>
<P>
But as it stands now, Dinah is entombed not by herself but by her creator, a 
stand-in who is unable to "surrender the pink." Or, perhaps, to paraphrase 
Bartleby, "the narrator would prefer not to."

TNT OPENS UP THE FAMOUS PLAYWRIGHT'S 'ORPHEUS DESCENDING'

"There she is," someone murmured. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Redgrave made her entrance, briskly walking onto a small PBS sound 
stage with cigarette in hand. She seemed tired and frail -- even vulnerable. 
Her red hair was dyed a brassy blond. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing dark brown contacts over her blue eyes, bedroom slippers and a frumpy 
black dress with a multicolored print, the actress looked like she stepped out 
of a Tennessee Williams play. And she had. 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave reluctantly had come in this Sunday morning, her one day off, to pose 
for publicity photos for TNT's production of Williams' drama "Orpheus 
Descending" (it premieres on the cable network Monday night). Despite her 
rather sullen demeanor, Redgrave began to cross her eyes and mug for the 
camera. A small group of onlookers laughed at her clowning. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she slowly moved to talk to a reporter while the crew readied the next 
setup. "Don't sit on the stool," she said maternally, bringing over a chair. 
"This is much more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Redgrave, 52, scored a hit in "Orpheus" in London and on Broadway, 
playing Lady Torrance, a lonely Sicilian immigrant wife whose life changes when 
a stranger (Kevin Anderson) wanders into the tiny Mississippi town where she 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Redgrave, Anderson and director Sir Peter Hall came to 
Jacksonville to film "Orpheus" for TNT. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting schedule had been grueling -- six days a week with Redgrave in 
practically every scene. Still, she said, "I am very, very glad we are doing 
this film for TV. Tennessee always wrote for film. 
</P>
<P>
"If a film tries to take away most of his dialogue -- because films are 
supposed to have less dialogue -- you immediately lose what makes him wonderful 
for film, that is, his stories and the way they develop and the characters' 
thoughts and situations. This is very far from being a film of the stage 
production. This is bringing it to completely new life." 
</P>
<P>
George Manasse, the producer of "Orpheus," said he found Redgrave "a consummate 
professional." 
</P>
<P>
"She damaged her knee on Broadway and had microsurgery on it," he said. "I was 
slightly concerned, but the other day she had a scene on her knees and I came 
in and she was kneeling on the concrete floor. There is tremendous dedication 
there." 
</P>
<P>
That dedication helped make "Orpheus" a critical and commercial hit on both 
sides of the Atlantic, though the original 1957 Broadway production closed 
after just 68 performances. Even the 1959 film version, "The Fugitive Kind," 
which starred Marlon Brando, Anna Magnani and Joanne Woodward, failed. 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave credits not herself, but today's audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I think audiences, which are just living people, have caught up with the times 
they are in," Redgrave said. "There was a lag. So when a writer writes 
something, and they say he's ahead of his time, it's the other people who are 
still behind. But then you have a big leap. You suddenly haven't a limited 
audience anymore, but a large audience for ideas which were first expressed a 
long time before." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the interview, Redgrave spoke softly, rarely making eye contact. She 
nervously kneaded her thighs. She seemed concerned that her politics would be 
the main subject of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave's controversial political beliefs have nearly overshadowed her 
numerous artistic successes. A member of England's radical Workers 
Revolutionary Party, she caused a furor after her 1978 Oscar acceptance speech 
(for "Julia") when she called Jewish protesters "Zionist hoodlums." Her 
convictions have cost her jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave now refuses to discuss politics or her personal life with the media 
and insists most journalists sign a contract agreeing to these terms (though no 
contract was required for this interview). Her self-imposed silence, though, 
has paid off. She now works almost nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
So what drew her to "Orpheus Descending"? 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave looked down at her dress and smoothed it. 
</P>
<P>
"The story tells, and the particular characters show, an extraordinary 
understanding of the situation of dispossessed people. The Sicilian 
dispossessed can't find jobs or keep their families together and have to 
immigrate to America to find a life. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't find (the life) here and become trapped. This (situation) comes 
together with the situation of the Indian people and the black American people 
and the situation of poor white sharecroppers, which is a reflection of the 
vestiges of a feudal society still there (in the South)at the time he 
(Williams) wrote it." 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave glanced up from her dress. "One of the wonderful things about doing 
this for TV is that it's going to mean people are going to see this story they 
don't know," she said. "People (will become acquainted)with the writing of this 
man. People know his name, but it doesn't mean very much to them because they 
don't see his writing anymore in the theater. It's important." 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave suddenly stopped. "What time is it?," she asked. "I have to leave at 2 
p.m." Someone checked a watch, saying it was nearly time to go. She smiled a 
smile of relief. The interview was over and she could get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orpheus Descending" airs on TNT Monday at 5 p.m., 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.; 
Tuesday at 7 a.m.; Saturday at 7 p.m., and Sept. 30 at 1:30 p.m.

ON THE FRONT LINES OF 'CIVIL WAR'; 
</P>
<P>
MASSIVE 9-PART SERIES ON PBS TELLS HISTORY AS IT REALLY WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns knew very little about the 
Civil War. "I had never been taught about the fighting," he said. "I had the 
most rudimentary sense of its centrality to the rest of the events in American 
history. To find out more, the way I do it is to make a film." 
</P>
<P>
Burns' "The Civil War" turned out to be more than "a film." It's a definitive, 
11-hour, nine-part documentary premiering Sunday night on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
Five years in the making -- a year longer than the Civil War itself -- the 
documentary uses more than 3,000 archival photos, newsreels of Civil War 
veterans, interviews with historians, live cinematography of the battlefields 
and first-person quotes from the time. Historian David McCullough of the PBS 
series "The American Experience" is the narrator. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're going to love it," said Burns with pride. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil War, Burns said, was the closest our nation has come to suicide. 
"It's the skeleton in our psychic closet. Periodically, the Civil War boils up 
to the surface, which it is doing now with (the 1989 film) 'Glory' and our 
series. 
</P>
<P>
"People prefer to wrap the war in rather bloodless myths and are perfectly 
content to perpetuate stereotypes. It's important to tell the real story 
because it doesn't lack in drama or excitement." 
</P>
<P>
Burns initially planned "The Civil War" as a five-hour documentary with each 
hour exploring one year of the war. Halfway through production, Burns realized 
five hours would barely do justice to the massive subject. 
</P>
<P>
"The first few months of editing produced an assembly that was 16 hours," he 
said. "We whittled it down to 11 hours." 
</P>
<P>
During the process, Burns discovered "thousands and thousands" of surprises 
about the Civil War. "I got to understand what happened in 20 or so battles -- 
each one a film unto itself," he said. "I got to see the heroic struggle of 
blacks, which is really one of the most inspiring stories to tell. We need to 
tell these stories and tell them truthfully." 
</P>
<P>
More than 160 archives throughout the country supplied the 3,000 photographs 
used in the film. "It was a huge organizational job," Burns said. "Can you 
imagine looking at 100,000 photographs, filming 16,000 and using 3,000?" 
</P>
<P>
Burns brings those stills to life by using such camera techniques as zooms, 
pans and wide shots. "I isolate minute portions of the image, creating new 
imagings," he explained. "If you combine this with the sound effects, sometimes 
you actually believe you are looking at a newsreel." 
</P>
<P>
One of the great faults of recorded history, Burns said, is that it dwells on 
famous figures. In the documentary, Burns uses quotes not only of Abraham 
Lincoln and Robert E. Lee, but also those of diplomats, women, townspeople and, 
most important, Pvt. Elisha Hunt Rhodes of the Union Army and Pvt. Sam Watkins 
of the Confederacy. "They are marvelous," Burns said. "They become the 
counterpart to the Lincolns, Lees and Grants." 
</P>
<P>
Among the writers and actors who provide voices for the 900 quotes are Sam 
Waterston, Morgan Freeman, Garrison Keillor, Horton Foote, Jeremy Irons, Derek 
Jacobi and Arthur Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"No Hollywood producer could pay for this cast," Burns said. "Most of these 
people worked for free or minimum scale." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the cast is Oscar-winning actor and Civil War buff Jason Robards 
Jr., who is the voice of Ulysses S. Grant. Robards said he jumped at the 
opportunity to be part of the series. "Ken really knows what he wants," said 
Robards, who previously worked with Burns on "Thomas Hart Benton." "He has a 
point of view, which can help you in documentaries. He just stuck a pen in my 
mouth as a cigar and I just talked. The material is what carries you." 
</P>
<P>
Burns used a complicated soundtrack to complement the stills and narration. 
"There are hundreds of music cues and then the sound effects, layer upon layer 
of muskets, yells, whoops and things like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With "The Civil War" behind him, Burns is busy on his next project. "I am doing 
the history of baseball," he said gleefully. "Once again, I'm saying it's going 
to be five one-hours, but I don't trust myself." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Civil War" airs Sunday-Thursday at 8 p.m. on KCET Channel 28 and KVCR 
Channel 24 and at 9 p.m. on KOCE Channel 50. It will air Sundays at 11 a.m. 
Sept. 30-Oct. 28 on KLCS Channel 58.

BODY BY HARRY CREWS (POSEIDON PRESS: $18.95; 240 PP.; 0-671-69576-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You might have thought that rock 'n' roll groups had run out of appellations 
with the The, a British ensemble that surfaced in the mid-1980s. Apparently 
not, as at least one group of musicians has adopted the name of -- horrors! -- 
a novelist: Harry Crews. 
</P>
<P>
The music itself is virtually unlistenable: raving recitations from the 
writer's books by performance artist Lydia Lunch, punctuated by bashing 
cymbals, crunching guitars and curses aimed at the audience. But the choice of 
namesake and source material is entirely appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
With 11 novels written (over 22 years) with the contained ferocity that marks 
the best of rock 'n' roll, Crews, 55, has sculpted many Passion Plays in which 
colorfully grotesque characters struggle to overcome spiritual and physical 
deficiencies, find love and avoid anonymous futures filled with despair and 
boredom. 
</P>
<P>
In "Car," a young idealist literally eats a 1971 Ford Maverick as a form of 
Communion, to express his devotion to the American automobile and all it 
represents; "The Gospel Singer" offers a tortured tent-shop evangelist whose 
too-beautiful singing voice promises salvation to vicious redneck hordes; and 
in "The Knockout Artist," a failed prizefighter with a glass jaw knocks himself 
out to amuse decadent crowds hungry for a cheap thrill. 
</P>
<P>
In "Body," muscular freaks starve themselves to the point of hysteria for the 
chance to achieve perfection and excel in a world obsessed with gluttonous 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Crews, raised in poverty in rural Georgia and now a fiction teacher at the 
University of Florida, is a delightful storyteller in the Southern Gothic 
tradition, with a keen ear for exotic dialogue and a raptorial eye for abnormal 
behavior. His writings -- both fictional and journalistic -- have examined the 
fanatical extremes in such activities as martial arts, dog and cock fights, 
boxing, evangelism, falconry, rattlesnake hunting and now, in his latest novel, 
body building. 
</P>
<P>
All of these tales employ comedy to camouflage the strong underlying currents 
of menace, rage and desperation among the rustic characters. "Body," labeled a 
tragicomedy, is a bit more tender than previous Crews novels, but all of the 
trademark elements are there in spades -- and it's laugh-out-loud funny. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the documentaries "Pumping Iron" and "Pumping Iron II: The Women" 
re-created by the cast of "Hee Haw" or "Twin Peaks," and you'll have a pretty 
good idea of what transpires in "Body." 
</P>
<P>
The setting is a convention hotel in south Florida where the international Mr. 
and Ms. Cosmos body-building competition is being staged: "In the pool, in 
chaise lounges, were enormously muscled men, their bodies veined and hairless 
-- and women without body fat, their skin diaphanous, their movements languid 
and deliberate, abdominal walls ridged with rows of muscle so sharply defined 
as to seem unreal, the mad imaginings of a mad artist." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Shereel Dupont, formerly Dorothy Turnipseed of Waycross, Ga., is 
preparing to do battle with Marvella Washington ("brutally and beautifully 
monstrous in size"), of Detroit's Black Magic Gymnasium, in a series of 
pose-downs. "Emporium of Pain" owner Russell (Muscle) Morgan and Wallace (The 
Wall) Wilson are their single-minded trainers, for whom a championship would 
mean life itself. 
</P>
<P>
The fun begins when, unannounced and unexpected, the Turnipseed clan (Alphonse, 
Ernestine, Earline, Motor and Turner, plus Shereel's onetime fiance "Nail Head" 
Barnes) and the Washington siblings (Jabella, Vanella, Shavella and Starvella) 
arrive at the hotel to cheer on their respective kin. What they actually end up 
doing is hilariously tossing the pageant up for grabs and unnerving nearly 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shereel understands her purpose here and pretty much represents all of 
Crews' protagonists in her desire to be "special": "She didn't exactly know why 
she left, but she had known since she was a little girl that she didn't want to 
live out her life in Waycross. She knew she didn't want to be just another 
Turnipseed in south Georgia." 
</P>
<P>
This echoes the imperative desire expressed in Crews' beautifully written 
memoirs, "A Childhood: The Biography of a Place," to escape his native Bacon 
County, Ga., and the mutual need to return much later, if only in his books, to 
the type of people who influenced him as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that "Body" ends tragically will come as no surprise to regular 
readers of Crews. Still, it is mostly uproarious, and even the most outrageous 
encounters are drawn with love and compassion. It stands with his best works.

Camp Cucamonga (NBC Sunday at 7 p.m.), a new TV movie set in a co-ed summer 
camp, offers a lineup of TV series stars plus G. Gordon Liddy. 
</P>
<P>
Pack of Lies (Channel 9 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is a taut, superior 1987 TV movie in 
which a suburban London couple allow British agents to spy on their neighbors. 
With Ellen Burstyn, Teri Garr and Alan Bates.

<P>
Suzanne Pleshette stars in Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean (CBS Sunday at 9

rape victim who is subsequently sued for slander by her attacker (Judd Hirsch). 
</P>
<P>
The Running Man (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a high energy 1987 futuristic science 
fiction thriller concocted by Stephen King under the nom de plume of Richard 
Bachman, has a comic book savagery that tends to undercut its own ideas about 
the brutalizing aspects of mass media. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a cop 
turned fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Gotham (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 8 p.m.), a 1988 cable 
movie is a misfired attempt to update the tough-guy detective movie of the '40s 
and give it a supernatural twist. Tommy Lee Jones stars as a down-and-out 
gumshoe who accepts a client (Colin Bruce who claims he's haunted by the ghost 
of his late wife (Virginia Madsen). 
</P>

With The Sure Thing (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) Rob Reiner puts a lively 
contemporary spin on "It Happened One Night" when he traps a pair of seemingly 
ill-matched Ivy Leaguers (John Cusack, Daphne Zuniga) in the same car heading 
to Los Angeles for Christmas.

The new TV movie Casey's Gift: For Love of a Child (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) tells 
how next-door neighbors are torn apart when the son of one family drowns 
accidentally in the pool of the other. Michael Tucker and Kevin Dobson star. 
</P>
<P>
A delightfully off-the-trails 1968 comedy-Western directed by Sydney Pollack, 
The Scalphunters (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) manages a wary, sly reversal of 
traditions. Burt Lancaster is a crusty trapper and Ossie Davis is a runaway 
slave who happens to be a literate, even effete man of poetry and haute 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 The new TV movie Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston (CBS Tuesday at 9 
p.m.) is based on the murder case that rocked Boston last October when a young 
husband (Ken Olin) tries to place the blame for his wife's death upon a black 
man. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunset (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) Wyatt Earp, legendary lawman of the 
Old West helps cowboy movie hero Tom Mix solve a Raymond Chandleresque murder 
mystery. Unfortunately, this 1986 Blake Edwards film misfires badly. James 
Garner is a wonderful Earp, even though a couple of decades too young, but 
Bruce Willis' Mix is so lifeless that his subsequent screen stardom came as a 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Cloak and Dagger (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is the inspired 1984 reworking 
of the 1947 thriller "The Window" in which a boy with an overactive imagination 
witnesses a murder but nobody will believe him. Henry Thomas stars as the boy, 
who has been given an imaginary hero and constant companion (Dabney Coleman, 
who also plays his sorely tried widower-father).

UNITED EUROPE: WHAT, WHO, WHEN; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPOWER; THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO EUROPE'S ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN 1992 BY 
NICHOLAS COLCHESTER AND DAVID BUCHAN (TIMES BOOKS/RANDOM HOUSE: $22.50; 256 
PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeffrey Garten, Garten, an investment banker in New York, worked in the 
Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations. He is writing a book for the Twentieth 
Century Fund on political and economic conflict among America, Japan and 
Germany in the 1990s. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the early 1980s, France, Germany, England and the other nine members of 
the European Community -- what Americans often call the Common Market -- 
finally negotiated common noise levels for lawn mowers. The idea was that 
manufacturers in one country should be able to sell their wares throughout the 
region without hassle. It took six years of bureaucratic wrangling to reach 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, these same countries have committed by 1992 to harmonize their 
respective laws on trade, travel, transport, construction services, government 
purchasing and banking. They have set their near-term sites on substituting a 
single European currency for francs, lire, pounds and marks -- and on creating 
a European Central Bank to manage the whole show. They have even scheduled a 
summit for this December to discuss political union. 
</P>
<P>
Are we seeing a basic transformation of the Old World into a United States of 
Europe, a new fountain of political ideas and industrial energy, and a powerful 
rival to the United States and Japan? Or is this the same old Common Market, 
just combining a temporary burst of vitality with some clever public relations, 
more flash than substance? 
</P>
<P>
In "Europower," two of Europe's most influential journalists -- Nicholas 
Colchester, deputy editor of the Economist, and David Buchan, Brussels 
correspondent of the Financial Times -- have concluded that something truly 
historic is taking place across the Atlantic. Call it a triumph of cooperation 
over centuries of animosities; call it a kind of supranationalism that 
eventually will become necessary for more countries in the global economy; call 
it what you like -- real change is occurring, they say, and the continent will 
never be the same again. 
</P>
<P>
"Europower" masterfully illustrates the practical obstacles that must be 
overcome before the European Community can realize its aspirations. For 
example, the authors describe the progress that has been made in lowering 
customs barriers, but they also point out that even if commerce cannot be 
stopped at the borders, other obstacles can be just as frustrating, such as 
different systems in each country for taxing or different standards for health 
and safety. 
</P>
<P>
They show that even though the Common Market can decree that European banks are 
free to set up shop throughout the continent and conduct all the business they 
would at home, at the same time local customs and ordinances still can clip the 
wings of foreign financial institutions. They demonstrate how the ideal of free 
travel within the Common Market leads to problems in apprehending drug dealers, 
terrorists and money launderers. They illustrate the far-reaching nature of 
what has become European law, but admit how difficult it often is to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
A second theme of "Europower" is the debate over "deepening" the community 
versus "widening" it. There are those who want to confine the evolution of the 
Common Market to its current 12 members -- at least for the next several years 
-- and to concentrate on deepening integration among the existing core group. 
To proponents of this approach, the overwhelming priority is to complete the 
process of integration to remove all existing barriers to trade, to create a 
single currency and a single central bank, and to build a system for common 
political management. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees. Others want to broaden the community to include new 
members like Norway, Sweden, Poland and Hungary. They understand that bringing 
in nations with such diverse traditions and needs would slow the pace of 
integration, but it's a price they are willing to pay (or, if they are 
skeptical of too much integration, it's a price they are happy to pay). 
</P>
<P>
Colchester and Buchan also highlight the arguments taking place over the 
political accountability which big, supranational European institutions -- such 
as a new European Central Bank -- would have to national parliaments. This is 
perhaps the single biggest philosophical issue facing West European leaders. 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for one, is appalled by the notion that 
interest rates and taxes in Birmingham or Brighton could be decided in Brussels 
or Frankfurt without the advice and consent of locally elected British 
officials who are responsible to grass-roots constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the authors explain the details of the entire program called "Europe 
of 1992." They provide an easily understood road map of the Community's 
political and economic institutions and how they work. And they manage to cover 
every important area of policy endeavor, including money, trade, immigration, 
anti-trust, law and defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
"Europower" seems to have been written primarily for a European audience, 
mainly to explain what's going on. Americans could use this information, too. 
But aside from digesting the facts, how should we feel about a United Europe of 
one sort or another? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly we are all for measures that give our friends and allies a better 
life, and we should be happy about economic and social links that make an 
intra-European war ever more remote. In addition, an American might well admire 
Europe for the remarkable momentum it has generated, starting from a stagnant 
position in the mid-1980s. We might be a bit envious about the political 
exhilaration and unbridled optimism across the Atlantic, at a time when we are 
mired in debts, deficits, banking scandals, soaring crime and deteriorating 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond all this, however, additional concerns might be warranted. A united 
Europe may be a big market for IBM, General Motors and AT&amp;T, but it is sure 
to make European firms more competitive in everything from aerospace to 
insurance. We might be happy that Europe is strong enough to look after itself, 
but as a new, powerful political entity the Community is sure to be more 
independent of Washington, whether the issue is currency alignment or support 
in the Middle East. A unified Europe will be a house for a reunified Germany, 
much to the relief of those with even passing knowledge of the past 100 years. 
But how long will it be before Berlin controls the keys? 
</P>
<P>
Colchester and Buchan do not directly examine these issues. Between the lines, 
however, it is not hard for an American reader to find them. 
</P>

LAST BOAT FROM MARIEL; 
</P>
<P>
THE PEREZ FAMILY BY CHRISTINE BELL (W. W. NORTON: $19.95; 256 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elena Brunet, Brunet, a Times editorial researcher and writer in Orange 
County, translated Pubis Angelical, a novel by Manuel Puig (Aventura 
Books/Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The whim of Fidel Castro, or Cuban prison authorities, achieves the release of 
Juan Raul Perez at the start of this ambitious work of fiction by Christine 
Bell, author of "Saint." 
</P>
<P>
After 20 years' incarceration, Perez finds himself a free man embarked for the 
United States on one of the last boats to sail during the Mariel boat lift of 
1981. Bald, toothless, underweight, he is not quite the man his wife left 
behind. His biggest fear is that his wife ("his reason for existence") may be 
dead or remarried, or unable to recognize "the toothless old man he had 
become." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Carmela, has waited for him. When the Mariel boat lift began, she 
made room in her closet and dressers to accommodate Juan Raul's clothes. But 
she has lost heart. Her brother, Angel, has hired a variety of boats -- yachts, 
fishing boats -- with no luck. He waited for two days when he rode on one of 
the boats himself, getting sunburned and bitten by mosquitoes. But the load of 
passengers that the Cuban authorities released was a family of eight strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration services are well acquainted with Angel, who asks with every 
boat-load whether a single man named Juan Perez has arrived. He is told there 
are a number of Juan Perezes, but none are single. 
</P>
<P>
That is because American immigration officials have mistaken Juan Raul and 
another passenger, Dorita Evita Perez, for husband and wife -- they share the 
same last name. 
</P>
<P>
Dorita Evita (who calls herself Dottie) provides a lust for life to fill what 
Juan Raul lacks. She got her release when she told Cuban authorities she wanted 
to leave for "John Wayne, Elvis Presley, rock and roll, blue jeans, nail polish 
. . . everything you say I cannot have." The authorities labeled her unfit and 
put her on a boat out of Mariel harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Dottie hears that it would expedite their gaining a sponsor if in fact they 
were a family ("I ask a lot of questions," she tells Juan), and Juan Raul is 
persuaded not to risk being on his own. He allows her to adopt a silent old man 
dressed in fatigues and carrying a knapsack -- whom they'll call Papa -- and a 
young man to pass as their son, Felipe Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Humor seasons the pathos of these characters. Juan Raul chases the old man (who 
tends to roam) and has to wash him, sometimes with his fatigues still on. 
Dottie finds her John Wayne in one of the security guards, Esteban Santesteban, 
and makes her interest abundantly clear, causing a near-slapstick turn of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Another refugee, Luz Paz, is unaware that theirs is a marriage of convenience 
and views this guard as a home wrecker. After sending her prayers to San Lazaro 
(patron saint of the poor), Luz Paz gives a gold coin to Felipe Perez to buy 
some dentures for the toothless old man to improve his looks. Felipe collides 
with an Impala pulling a Plexiglas-enclosed trailer carrying a another statue 
of San Lazaro and is knocked unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of events taking place around him, Juan Perez writes notes to his 
wife, with whom he has not communicated in more than a year. "Oh my Love, I am 
alive . . . I long for you as I have longed for you for 20 years." But he never 
sends the letters. 
</P>
<P>
When Juan Raul (wearing "a lime-green parrot shirt and bell-bottoms") musters 
the courage to approach her house midway through the book, he inadvertently 
sets off a burglar alarm that Angel has installed. (Angel bought her a pistol 
and had an instructor at a shooting range teach her to shoot -- in protection 
against the Marielitos.) Carmela tells the police officers who respond that 
there was something familiar about the alleged burglar: "I had this uncanny 
feeling that I had seen him before . . . He reminded me of the old beggars in 
Havana Square when I was a little girl." 
</P>
<P>
This scene reflects the difficulty that assimilated Cubans had in accepting the 
new immigrants of the Mariel boat lift. Castro, having emptied his prisons, 
caused such unfortunates as Juan Perez to be prejudged unjustly as Fidel's bad 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
The novel concludes on a semi-sweet note, an acting-out of a worn Cuban joke 
about the number of Cubans named Perez. Flavia (Angel's fiancee), a singer 
performing at an outdoor concert, arranges to have Carmela and Juan Raul Perez 
both attend her concert. When she calls for Mr. and Mrs. Juan Perez "to be 
reunited on the dance floor after 20 years of separation, two people she had 
never seen before ran into each other's arms. The crowd went wild." 
</P>
<P>
The cast of Cubans behaves at times almost like caricatures of themselves, with 
very funny exaggerated passions and typically Latin outbursts. Bell's novel 
successfully combines historical verity and a subtle seriousness with the humor 
and laughs that are her trademark.

AN UGLY SAGA OF EVERYWOMAN; 
</P>
<P>
NOW YOU KNOW BY KITTY DUKAKIS, WITH JANE SCOVELL (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $19.95; 
315 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-671-68458-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Felicia Kornbluh 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1988 presidential campaign offered one picture of Michael and Kitty 
Dukakis. They were a perfect American couple, with successful children, a 
lovely but modest suburban home and an almost unbelievably strong marriage. One 
reporter, sneaking through the bushes outside their house, discovered only the 
Dukakises dancing together in their living room. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Dukakis' memoir, "Now You Know," tells another story, not about her 
marriage to the governor of Massachusetts but about her own internal turmoil. 
Although parts of this story emerged during the campaign and have been reported 
since then, much that is new, surprising and disturbing emerges in this often 
brutally frank first-person account. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the smiling faces of this would-be First Family lies a story of 
addiction and depression, a long-held and only partially successful battle with 
the demons of self-doubt and hidden substance abuse. If the Kitty Dukakis we 
saw on television in 1987 and 1988 represented Everywoman, then the Kitty 
Dukakis of "Now You Know" represents an equally familiar, if often troubling, 
modern figure: the woman who appears to have everything but is tortuously 
convinced that she has nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Katharine Dickson Dukakis was addicted to amphetamines for 26 years. She 
entered treatment in 1982 and announced herself cured in the midst of the 1988 
campaign. In the wake of that same disastrous campaign, she began a rapid 
descent into alcoholism. She entered treatment again, and emerged taking 
Prozac, an anti-depressant drug. By the end of 1989, she was no longer taking 
Prozac but had started drinking again. 
</P>
<P>
One evening last November, when she was depressed and desperate for a drink, 
Kitty Dukakis consumed nearly enough rubbing alcohol to kill herself -- 
although she insists that suicide was never her intention. After more 
treatment, she returned home. Within weeks she had swallowed large amounts of 
Tylenol with codeine and enough assorted household products -- including 
vanilla extract, men's after-shave, nail-polish remover and hair spray -- plus 
alcohol, to require treatment once more. Dukakis now declares herself a 
recovering alcoholic, drug addict and depressive; she takes Lithium to control 
her dark moments, and puckishly hopes for the best. 
</P>
<P>
Substance abuse is not the only secret in Kitty Dukakis' past. She also has a 
tangled family history. Her mother was the product of an illicit tenement union 
between two teen-agers, one Irish and one Jewish. At the insistence of both 
sets of parents, and with the help of esteemed Rabbi Stephen Wise, Kitty 
Dukakis' mother was adopted by a wealthy German-Jewish family, while her own 
mother served (covertly) as her nursemaid for the first three years of her 
life. The wealthy Goldbergs sent Dukakis' mother to school in Europe at age 10; 
they divorced shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
However, "Now You Know" is not merely an airing of Kitty Dukakis' dirty 
laundry. This is because the image projected in 1988 was not all wrong; the 
memoir is as faithful to the clean, and often quite uninteresting, details of 
her mid-century, middle-class existence as it is to the gritty, interesting 
ones. The reader learns, for example, that with the exception of a short-lived 
first marriage, Kitty Dukakis has lived in the elite, largely Jewish Boston 
suburb of Brookline for the entirety of her adult life. 
</P>
<P>
The town, the era and her status-conscious mother helped make Kitty a popular 
girl, a "May Queen" at Penn State and a bride before her 20th birthday. Her 
mother taught Kitty that she could never be too rich or too thin, and by the 
time she met Michael Dukakis in 1961, she had developed a steady habit of 
taking amphetamine diet pills. 
</P>
<P>
By 1988, the threads of Kitty Dukakis' existence had nearly unraveled: Her 
children all were working or in college; Michael was a household name, and his 
wife had no more independent power than she had had at the Penn State 
Homecoming three decades earlier. The head-rush of the presidential campaign 
thrust Kitty Dukakis into the limelight even more precipitously than it did her 
husband. She liked it there. Important people asked her questions, and they 
left the camera running while she answered. 
</P>
<P>
It could not last. By the fall of 1988, it was increasingly clear that Michael 
Dukakis would lose the election. No one will pretend that losing a chance at 
the presidency of the United States is easy for the man who does it, but at 
least he had a job to come home to. As she started her problem-drinking, Kitty 
Dukakis must have known she was on her way back to Brookline and solitude. Her 
worst fears were confirmed in November: 
</P>
<P>
"To say the rug was pulled out from under me when Michael was defeated would be 
far too feeble a description; the world was pulled out from under me, a world 
of constant activity, motion, energy -- everything I thrive on. I felt as 
though I had been squashed in a giant compactor; all the breath went out of me. 
. . . Two mornings after the election, he was working in his office at the 
State House while I was drinking in our bedroom on Perry Street." 
</P>
<P>
Her fear and dissatisfaction were compounded by a sense of guilt. At one of her 
many treatment centers, she remembers, "I felt guilty, too, surrounded as I was 
by others whose histories were far more severe than mine. I did not come from a 
dysfunctional family. I have a loving husband, wonderful kids, financial 
security and a position of prominence. I had everything, and I had nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Dukakis never blames her husband for any of her troubles; but neither, in 
her presentation, does he seem to have been much help. Perhaps this is because 
Kitty Dukakis is so determined -- in a way every "12-step" program would 
approve -- to take full responsibility for her own actions. But it is possible 
to take this philosophy too far. In the dynamics of addiction, one person is 
rarely solely responsible. Kitty Dukakis says this obliquely when she writes 
about admitting her alcoholism: 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (a relative) saying, 'Alcoholism is a family disease.' 
</P>
<P>
"Michael reacted violently: 'I don't care what kind of disease it is, my wife 
needs help.' " 
</P>
<P>
Feeling sorry for Kitty Dukakis is different from excusing her political 
remembrances, which are sprinkled liberally throughout the text. In her take on 
an afternoon with British royalty, for example, most of which she spent with 
Prince Philip, Kitty Dukakis sounds like a candidate for the Miss America 
crown: "What a charming man," she assesses. "What an exciting day!" Similarly, 
in evaluating vice presidential nominee Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis positively 
gushes. And in analyzing her husband's candidacy, Dukakis offers little that is 
new: 
</P>
<P>
"Why did my husband lose the election? My personal belief is that Michael 
Dukakis was not identified strongly enough in terms of any of his attributes 
before the other party began to attack him. . . . He doesn't show his emotions 
easily, but, dammit, he has them. I wouldn't be married to him if he didn't! . 
. . In politics, honor is quaint. If you want to rise to the top, it seems you 
have to stoop a bit first." 
</P>
<P>
Believing that his "honor" and Republican dirty tricks were all that stood 
between Michael Dukakis and the presidency may make things easier at home, but 
it won't help the Democrats win elections. 
</P>
<P>
They might come closer to winning if they figure out what Jesse Jackson had in 
1988 that the official candidate so desperately lacked. Kitty Dukakis' 
gossiping jibes at Jackson are the worst part of the book, not least because 
they lack originality. (The second-worst part is her repeated effort to "dress 
up" her prose with sophomoric references to Greek mythology and morsels of 
Great Western Literature.) In remembering the first Jackson speech she 
attended, Kitty Dukakis offers the familiar critique: 
</P>
<P>
"As often happens with Jesse Jackson, there weren't many specific proposals for 
change, but that didn't seem to bother his listeners. . . . . That first time I 
heard Jesse Jackson in person, all stories of his 'charisma' were borne out. . 
. . Nonetheless, persuasive rhetoric aside, I had real reservations about Jesse 
Jackson's qualifications to be President of the United States. He was a 
preacher who had never held an elective office. . . . Beyond the sound and the 
fury, his speeches lacked significance." 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Dukakis has written an occasionally eye-opening memoir of a largely 
straitened life. Her message may ring true for many readers, those of us who 
were never nominated for "May Queen" as well as those who were, those who 
grimace at our morning coffee consumption and midnight binges, as well as those 
with graver problems of substance abuse. Sharing another woman's experiences 
may not cure us -- but, at any rate, now we know.

NAVIGATING A FRIENDSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
CHLOE AND OLIVIA BY BELL GALE CHEVIGNY (GROVE WEIDENFELD: $18.95; 355 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Friendship. It's hardly a modern invention. For centuries, women have enjoyed 
the luxury of this special human attachment. While they may have bonded in town 
squares and drawing rooms, friendships between women were frowned upon in 
literature. In her 1929 feminist work, "A Room of One's Own," Virginia Woolf 
pondered the shock waves such a literary friendship might cause: " 'Chloe liked 
Olivia.' Do not start. Do not blush. Let us admit in the privacy of our own 
society that these things sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women." 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gale Chevigny borrows the title of her novel from this literary "what if" 
posed by Woolf. "Chloe and Olivia" offers an update on friendship, and 
chronicles 14 years in the lives of two complex women living in difficult 
times. Just as the hypothetical Chloe and Olivia reflect the mood of their era, 
the contemporary Chloe and Olivia mirror the tumultuous '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Chloe likes Olivia immediately. They meet in Rome in 1961. They're both 
graduate students, yet in all other aspects they're complementary opposites, a 
contradiction in personalities. Chloe is short, blond and 24 years old. Olivia 
is tall, dark and 21. Chloe is from a Mom-Dad-and-three-children family in 
Syracuse, N. Y. Olivia was born in Italy. Her father was an American soldier 
killed in the war, and her mother was an Italian opera singer who worked with 
the underground resistance. Chloe is fiercely independent, while Olivia is 
attached to a handsome artist named Karl. "I'm a better painter than I am a 
person," he ominously admits to Chloe. 
</P>
<P>
The bond between the women is instantaneous, and as they talk through the 
night, the ground rules that will sustain their friendship are established: 
"Olivia had told so much, and if Chloe didn't respond in kind, friendship would 
be impossible. It was like a law: You had to take your turn." 
</P>
<P>
Following their idyllic months together in Italy, Chloe moves to New York and 
begins teaching. Olivia's plans are vague. She impulsively marries Karl while a 
stunned Chloe watches in "awe." Karl accepts a teaching assignment in Arizona. 
Olivia promises to write. 
</P>
<P>
A year-and-a-half passes, and Olivia visits New York with Hannah, her infant 
daughter. Chloe feels anything but maternal and attempts to match Olivia's 
show- and-tell with a pet snake: "She's exactly 5 foot 4, like me." Their lives 
have veered in opposite directions. The mood is understandably tense. This is 
not to be their last crisis. The conflicts in their friendship are as frequent 
and as intense as the struggles in their separate lives and in the world around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia returns to her new home in Oregon, where Karl has taken a position with 
a museum art school. Thus begins a cross-country friendship, punctuated with 
brief visits, sporadic letters and infrequent phone calls. Whether it's on 
Chloe's turf in New York (where she involves Olivia in an anti-war 
demonstration and a night-on-the-town in Harlem with her social-worker 
boyfriend, Gabe) or on the West Coast with Olivia, their hours are packed with 
unrestrained dialogue that quickly cuts to the core of their lives. As Olivia 
explains to Chloe, "No one knows me better than you. I realize it when I see 
you. You go so far back and remember so much, it's sometimes a burden. You know 
what I hoped for and you've seen me fail and fail . . . but you hang in. Even 
when you're not there." 
</P>
<P>
If only distance was their greatest obstacle! It's a wonder the friendship 
survives, considering it must constantly compete with such major outside 
distractions as marriage, infidelity, divorce, graduate school, careers, death 
of parents, miscarriage, abortion and illness. When the civil-rights struggle, 
Vietnam and the women's movement are added to those traumas, there isn't a 
whole lot of time for chit-chat. While Chloe wages a personal war on behalf of 
her political and social causes, Olivia grapples with an unhappy marriage and 
the difficulty of rearing a daughter alone. 
</P>
<P>
Time and the multitude of events that shape the years serve primarily as a 
backdrop for the friendship. A professor of literature at the State University 
of New York at Purchase, Chevigny effectively uses the passage of time like a 
microscope to re-examine important experiences and conversations. An incident 
will occur in the present, then immediately the dialogue will flash ahead 
several years to a discussion in which Chloe and Olivia look back on that same 
moment. The image thus becomes clearer as the characters move farther away. 
</P>
<P>
"Chloe and Olivia" captures the complex give-and-take that is a friendship. The 
novel offers a rich glimpse into the reasons why women form these bonds, why 
some last and others fail, and why the participants work so hard to sustain 
these vital connections. 
</P>
<P>
When I finished the story of Chloe and Olivia, I was compelled to put aside my 
chores and nagging deadlines, pour myself a cup of tea, sink into a comfortable 
chair, pick up the phone and leave a message on the answering machine of my 
"Chloe," about 2,596 miles away.

ANOMIE IN A SHIFTING REALITY; 
</P>
<P>
A PLAN FOR ESCAPE BY ADOLFO BIOY-CASARES TRANSLATED BY SUZANNE JILL LEVINE 
(GRAYWOLF PRESS: $7.50, PAPER; 116 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Adolfo Bioy-Casares' choice of point of view is brilliant: He filters 
experiences through the guarded speculations of someone who hasn't participated 
in them. Juxtaposed with excerpts of an exiled Frenchman's letters are 
narrative passages from his uncle who tries to make sense of the letters while 
freeing himself from any sense of responsibility for his nephew's bizarre fate. 
From the first page of his cryptic novel, "A Plan for Escape," Bioy-Casares 
challenges his readers to question the reliability of this narrator. 
</P>
<P>
First published in 1945, the book explores the decline and corruption of the 
individual trapped within a machine of violence. Bioy-Casares draws parallels 
to the atrocities of Nazi Germany in his treatment of horror and confusion, 
conspiracy and fear. As his characters attempt to endure or overcome a corrupt 
system that is secretive about its ever-changing rules, they are weakened or 
contaminated. Hallucinations, misinterpretations and paranoia lead them into 
irrational acts, but these acts don't matter nearly as much as the increasing 
disorientation that arises from them. 
</P>
<P>
A spoiled young Frenchman, Henri Nevers, is exiled to a group of camouflaged 
islands off French Guiana to assist a governor who believes that his operation 
is regulated by a unique order. Nevers, who always considered it absurd to 
"meddle in things that had already happened," is disturbed by rumors of 
mysterious experiments with prisoners in this world in which its inhabitants 
are "dreaming that we dream." The prisoners are conditioned to imagine their 
world "vividly, obsessively" and are kept in isolation "so that the obsession 
would remain pure." 
</P>
<P>
As the characters manipulate each others' reality, they move within a 
nightmarish landscape where it's not always clear who the enemy is, and where 
the power structure can change at any moment. "The governor was sure of 
participating in the dream of the islands that he infused in others; but he was 
afraid of losing forever our vision of reality." 
</P>
<P>
Kept awake by his fear of insomnia, Nevers plots to get off the islands. He 
wants to believe that his "stay in the Guianas was merely an episode in my 
life. Time would erase it, as it did other dreams." Instead, he becomes 
obsessed with the secrets and sheds his passivity by setting out on an obscure, 
self-imposed mission that includes a false confession, intrigue and forged 
identities. But perhaps he is not gaining a new independence; perhaps he is 
merely playing his part within the governor's dream machine. "He found himself 
before a growing conglomeration of mysteries. Were they independent of each 
other? Or were they linked; did they form a system, perhaps still incomplete?" 
</P>
<P>
Born in Argentina, Adolfo Bioy-Casares is well known as Jorge Luis Borges' 
collaborator and friend. His numerous works, including novels, film scripts and 
short stories, have been translated into many languages. "A Plan for Escape," 
like some of his previous works, explores the disintegration of communication 
within an ever-shifting reality.

<P>
When Martin Scorsese was 8 years old, he drew. Sketches mostly, elaborate 
shot-by-shot renderings of flicks he'd seen at the local movie theater. 
Sometimes they were movies that existed only in his imagination, to be 
recreated on paper. Drawn in pencil and crayon, they were often titled 
"Directed and Produced by Martin Scorsese." By the age of 12, Martin was 
drawing colorful Bible epics and Westerns, grappling with how to compose his 
comic-book panels so as to achieve maximum visual effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted them to be really big," he says now, laughing at his own 
precociousness, "but I was having trouble drawing close-ups in the 
70-millimeter format. To this day, directors still have this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese is on his home turf, New York City, seated in his office in the Brill 
Building in the heart of Times Square. Talking about his earliest attempts to 
interpret the world in a visual form seems to bring him great pleasure. His 
eyes are alive and his face animated, an expressive look accentuated by the 
fact that he has recently shaved his familiar black beard. Gone is the dark, 
Mephistophelean character who, from the back seat of Robert De Niro's cab in 
"Taxi Driver," rhapsodized about murdering his unfaithful wife with a .44 
magnum. The devilish black eyebrows are still in evidence, but his features are 
smooth and accessible now, making it a lot easier to picture the 8-year-old 
Martin bringing his memories and fantasies to life frame by frame. 
</P>
<P>
As Scorsese remembers it, the years passed and his sketches were set aside. A 
somewhat sickly kid with asthma, he watched the world unfold from the window of 
his parents' apartment on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy. Restricted from 
playing outdoors with other kids because of his condition, he developed the eye 
of an outsider while living in a tough neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Scorsese ventured out on his own, and the rest is an oft-told 
story: the months spent in a seminary studying to be a priest; his years as a 
wunderkind student filmmaker and, later, a teacher at New York University, and 
the beginnings of his career in the film business as an editor and then a 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, there were the movies: "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Raging 
Bull," "The Last Temptation of Christ." Certainly Scorsese's work has received 
accolades -- Oscar nominations for Best Director ("Raging Bull," "The Last 
Temptation of Christ" and Best Picture ("Raging Bull," "Taxi Driver") and the 
highest praise from his peers. "Raging Bull" was selected in critics' polls by 
Premiere, USA Today and others as the best film of the last decade. At age 47, 
Scorsese was profiled on the PBS program "American Masters," an honor that put 
him in the category of such national treasures as Billie Holiday, Jasper Johns 
and Arthur Miller. Among cineastes here and in Europe, Scorsese is generally 
considered the most interesting and talented director in America, if not the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, his success has not spared him the unhappy vicissitudes of life. In fact, 
some have observed that Scorsese's total devotion to his work -- his downright 
obsessiveness -- has often been destructive to his personal well being. He's 
seen two wives come and go. His health has frequently suffered, with various 
stints in hospitals for mental exhaustion before and after shooting some of his 
films. And even though he is acknowledged as a brilliant filmmaker, getting 
financial backing for his occasionally provocative projects is never easy. 
Despite the critical acclaim, his films do not bring in the receipts of those 
by Messrs. Spielberg and Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
"The money people respect Marty. They like his movies. But he makes them 
uneasy," says his longtime producer and friend, Irwin Winkler. "They never know 
what to expect from one of his pictures, and that's not considered good 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Scorsese admits, the burdens of filmmaking can lead to a kind of 
emotional isolation, much like that experienced by the main character in one of 
his favorite movies, Michael Powell's "Peeping Tom." Released in Great Britain 
in 1960, it tells the story of a man whose obsession with filmmaking causes 
great tension in his life. Eventually, the man begins filming himself murdering 
people by stabbing them with the tripod of his 8-millimeter camera. In this 
movie, Scorsese says, "you can see the danger of filmmaking, at least for the 
people who express themselves through film." 
</P>
<P>
So why does he continue to plunge deeper and deeper into his art? There is the 
sense that he really has no choice. The way he sees it, his current vocation is 
the inevitable extension of what he's been doing since he was 8 years old: 
taking his accumulated experiences, imagination and personal anguish and 
putting them all together, shot by shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't imagine Marty doing anything other than what he's doing," says 
Winkler, who produced "GoodFellas," Scorsese's 12th and latest feature. "It's 
like that line in 'Taxi Driver': 'There never was any hope for me.' With Marty, 
it was preordained." 
</P>
<P>
PACING BACK AND FORTH in his Times Square office, Scorsese is mildly unsettled. 
Not upset, mind you, or annoyed or even uneasy. Unsettled. The source of his 
discomfort has to do with a press preview screening of "GoodFellas." It was a 
couple of months prior to the film's release, and as far as Scorsese is 
concerned, the film was an unfinished product. Most of it was there, of course 
-- the brooding cinematography, the 1950s and '60s period detail, the music. 
Even the editing was completed. 
</P>
<P>
So what was missing? One thing: a finished version of the title credits. 
</P>
<P>
"For me," says Scorsese, in his inimitable staccato delivery, "credit sequences 
are sometimes more important than the movie, because they present the picture a 
certain way. They promise something." 
</P>
<P>
Judging from Scorsese's movies, his concern for credit sequences is obviously 
genuine. Who could forget the home movie and typewriter titles of "Mean 
Streets"? Or the luxurious cutout Manhattan skyline that adorned the titles for 
"New York, New York"? Or, most triumphantly, Jake La Motta shadow boxing to the 
strains of Pietro Mascagni at the beginning of "Raging Bull"? But listening to 
Scorsese, you get the impression that whatever he's working on at the moment, 
that's the most important thing in the picture. Whether it's pre-production, 
the rigors of actually shooting the movie, the editing, the music, or one of 
the last and most taken-for-granted elements of movie making, the title 
credits, to Scorsese it is the one thing that could make or break the film. 
</P>
<P>
For many viewers, it is this perfectionism that makes Scorsese's movies so 
watchable. His "story boards," or frame-by-frame drawings, for the terrifying 
climactic shoot-out in "Taxi Driver" show a loving attention to detail. 
Excitedly, he talks of the pleasure -- the self-discovery -- of editing "Raging 
Bull" with his long-time collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker. And he fondly 
remembers the fun he had devising elegant camera moves for "The Color of Money" 
with cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who also worked with him on 
"GoodFellas." 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese's office is amazingly neat; every note pad and pencil has its place. 
There are three VCRs and a TV against one wall, a bookshelf containing bound 
volumes of scholarly film periodicals against the other. The walls are dotted 
with photographs -- two of Scorsese with his good friend Robbie Robertson, 
former leader of The Band, who starred in Scorsese's rock 'n' roll documentary, 
"The Last Waltz." There are also framed movie posters of "The Kiss of Death," 
"The Shanghai Gesture" and "The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp," the 
penultimate movie by his late friend and mentor, Michael Powell. Dominating the 
room, mounted on the wall above his desk, is an ornate fresco depicting 
Christ's crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written about Scorsese's neurotic, rapid-fire mode of 
conversation. Even his own publicist warns interviewers to take along a good 
tape recorder and an extra set of batteries. But nothing quite prepares you for 
it. Scorsese's words flow out in a torrent, intense, sometimes blustery. He is 
not a pontificator in the manner of an Orson Welles; he is constantly probing, 
trying to communicate his emotional connection to whatever he may be talking 
about at the moment. His mind is lively and quick, and sometimes his speech 
struggles to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Scorsese appears reasonably content. Of course, there are the 
expected anxieties that come with opening a $25-million movie, especially one 
that exhibits Scorsese's usual commercially risky approach -- harsh, disturbing 
violence; absence of plot, and a two-hour-and-20-minute running time. But for 
the man who was almost crucified by fundamentalists for making a movie about 
Christ, "GoodFellas" promises a smooth ride. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Nicholas Pileggi's 1985 nonfiction book, "Wiseguy," "GoodFellas" is a 
panoramic view of underworld life, spanning three decades. Focusing on a group 
of low-level tough guys and racketeers from a section of Brooklyn known as East 
New York, it covers terrain familiar to the director, whose portrayals of 
working-class life in New York have long since become the standard for other 
filmmakers. To facilitate his vision, he cast many people he has worked with 
before, including his frequent collaborator, Robert De Niro. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew I would return to this subject matter," says Scorsese, who made 
his low-budget gangster classic, "Mean Streets," more than 18 years ago. "When 
Pileggi's book came out, I read it from front to back; it was the most 
authentic thing I had read on this way of life. So I thought, hey, there's no 
sense in me doing another picture about this way of life unless I can approach 
it in a unique way." 
</P>
<P>
For Scorsese, coming up with a unique approach often means seeing every movie 
ever made on the subject. "Mean Streets" was at least partially intended as an 
ode to the 1930s Warner Bros. gangster movies. The ominous, paranoid look of 
"Taxi Driver" was influenced by an eclectic collection of films, including 
Alfred Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man." For "The Last Temptation of Christ," 
Scorsese studied "King of Kings," "The Greatest Story Ever Told" and Pier Paolo 
Pasolini's "The Gospel According to St. Matthew," among others. 
</P>
<P>
But "GoodFellas," says Scorsese, has no such cinematic antecedents. Although he 
quickly acknowledges that "everything from this genre properly comes from the 
inspiration of 'Public Enemy' and 'Little Caesar,' " the idea was "to come up 
with something that was without precedent in terms of style -- that was the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Critics like to write about Scorsese's expressive cinematic style. Cited most 
often is the mobility of the camera in his movies, the way it swoops and tracks 
and pans its way into the lives of his characters. "Certain directors will 
emphasize the lighting of a scene," Scorsese says. "But for me, it's the sense 
of motion. I love the way the camera moves. I love the cut from one moving shot 
to the next, or the cut from a moving shot to a static shot. The inspiration 
always comes from the point of view of the lens." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a flashy visual style has little or nothing to do with a 
director's search for the truth. In today's Hollywood, where film-school 
diplomas are ubiquitous, there are plenty of directors out there with nothing 
but style. With Scorsese, there is another element to his work that is at least 
equally distinctive and important. It has to do with something he remembers 
vividly from the movies he saw as a kid, something he refers to simply as "the 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
"THE THING THAT'S great about Marty," says Joe Pesci, who plays a pivotal role 
in "GoodFellas," "is that he's very open to what an actor has to say. And even 
if he doesn't use what you say, he doesn't make you feel like yours was a 
stupid idea and his is better. He wants and expects you to contribute -- 
chances are, that's why he picked you in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Pesci's admiration of Scorsese goes beyond the usual actor-director 
relationship. The two New Yorkers have been good friends ever since Scorsese 
"discovered" Pesci in the late 1970s. At that time, Pesci had given up acting 
and was managing an Italian restaurant in the Bronx. Scorsese and De Niro were 
looking for a fresh face to play De Niro's brother in "Raging Bull." They had 
viewed a low-budget movie called "The Debt Collector" to check out another 
actor, but when they spotted Pesci in the movie, they knew he had the 
authenticity they were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
On the set, it took Pesci a while to adjust to Scorsese's methods. The director 
and De Niro, who had already made three memorable films together, would often 
huddle off to the side and talk privately. "I mean, when Robert De Niro and 
Martin Scorsese do that to you, it can be very intimidating," says Pesci. But 
eventually, Scorsese pulled him aside and explained that he felt an actor would 
be less inhibited if he or she were able to talk privately about a certain 
scene outside the earshot of others. 
</P>
<P>
In "GoodFellas," Pesci plays Tommy DeVito, a jovial, talkative hood with a 
pathological propensity for violence. He gives a performance steeped in 
naturalism. "That's Marty's thing," the actor says. "He always says 'I don't 
want you to act like anybody; I just want you to behave the way you behave.' 
And he's a great acting coach because he stays on you that way. I probably 
shouldn't say this 'cause I may never get another job, but I wouldn't care if I 
never worked for any director other than Marty." 
</P>
<P>
The respect Pesci and other actors feel towards Scorsese is not limited to 
those who have worked with him. Read almost any interview with an actor or 
actress these days, and, when asked what they hope to do before their career is 
over, they all say, "Work with Scorsese." Some are even motivated to take 
action, like Paul Newman, who wrote Scorsese a fan letter after seeing "Raging 
Bull" (Newman misidentified him as "Michael" Scorsese). Later, the two worked 
together on "The Color of Money." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Scorsese such a rare director is his ability to combine a visually 
sophisticated approach with an unparalleled attentiveness to his actors. Like 
Hitchcock, the master, Scorsese is known for his thorough pre-production; he 
knows what he wants long before shooting begins. But unlike Hitchcock, 
Scorsese's method does not sap the juices from his actors. He seems to elicit 
such great performances (De Niro, Newman and Ellen Burstyn have all won Best 
Acting Oscars working with Scorsese, for "Raging Bull," "The Color of Money" 
and "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore," respectively) precisely because he 
compels his actors to dig as deeply into the material as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The passion Pesci conveys when talking about Scorsese is echoed by others who 
worked on "GoodFellas." Ray Liotta lobbied hard for the role of Henry Hill, the 
half-Irish, half-Sicilian Mafia wannabe whose recollections of life in the mob 
were the focus of Pileggi's book. "Marty definitely gives you the ball," says 
Liotta. 
</P>
<P>
"He cast all these strong-minded Italians in the movie," says Lorraine Bracco, 
who plays Henry Hill's wife, "people who wanted to have a cappuccino and a 
discussion after every scene. And I remember, one day, he was banging his hand 
against his head, saying, 'What did I do, what did I do?' But, really, Marty 
thrives on that kind of input. He's ego-less in allowing his actors to bring 
who they are into the role, and he loves them for it." 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese's love for the performance stems in part from his appreciation of film 
history. "I simply saw 'East of Eden' over and over again," he explains, "or 
'On the Waterfront' -- that's the acting school I went to. Topped off by 
Olivier in 'Richard III,' or Orson Welles. Welles in 'Touch of Evil' is beyond 
belief; his enjoyment of expressing himself on screen is so strong you can feel 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese's method sounds simple enough: truth in casting. He often uses 
non-actors in his films, including his parents. Catherine Scorsese, his mother, 
has a few big scenes in "GoodFellas" as Tommy DeVito's mother. Even the 
professional actors in the film -- De Niro, Pesci, Liotta and Bracco -- all 
come from backgrounds not unlike those of the characters they portray. "Some 
wonderful actors wanted to be in 'GoodFellas,' " he says ruefully, "and I wish 
I could have used them. But they'd have had to learn about the lifestyle. 
Better to get people who had some contact with it growing up. Because when 
you're growing up, it stays in your mind, and you can draw on that. It reminds 
you of certain images, certain people you knew in your childhood." 
</P>
<P>
For a man with such a strong identification with actors, Scorsese is strangely 
dispassionate when it comes to his own sporadic acting career, which he claims 
means little to him. His extraordinary cameo in "Taxi Driver" happened only 
because the actor who was supposed to play the part didn't show up for work 
that day. He agreed to appear in " 'Round Midniqht" as Goodly, the jazz 
promoter and quintessential New Yorker, because Winkler was producing the 
movie. Recently, he shaved his beard to appear as a blacklisted Hollywood 
director in "Guilty by Suspicion," written and directed by Winkler and starring 
De Niro. And, in an imaginative bit of type-casting, he was enlisted by the 
great Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa, to portray Vincent Van Gogh in the 
recently released "Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very complimentary that friends of mine keep wanting to put me in their 
films," he says. "I don't like it, but you learn what it's like to wait on a 
set, to be in front of a lens, to hear nothing from the director and the 
cameraman and see them talking over in the corner." He laughs. "You find 
yourself looking with expectancy and saying, 'Was it good? Gee, maybe it wasn't 
good.' " 
</P>
<P>
A simpatico relationship between actor and director is not always a given in 
Hollywood, and Scorsese attributes his own respect for actors to the influence 
of a very un-Hollywoodlike personality: John Cassavetes. In the early 1960s, he 
first saw Cassavetes' "Husbands" and was overwhelmed by the raw, spontaneous 
authenticity of the performances. He learned from Cassavetes that an actor's 
energy should be nurtured and directed, not squelched. Later, he and Cassavetes 
became close friends. It was Cassavetes who took Scorsese aside after seeing a 
rough cut of "Boxcar Bertha," Scorsese's first Hollywood feature, and told the 
young director he'd just spent a year of his life "making a piece of shit. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you have something you really want to do," prodded Cassavetes, 
"something personal?" It gave Scorsese the motivation to make the highly 
autobiographical "Mean Streets." 
</P>
<P>
When Cassavetes died last year at the age of 59, Scorsese was saddened not only 
by the director's death but also by his own inability to confront the 
inevitable. Living in New York, he had put off flying to California to visit 
Cassavetes, even when he knew his friend was dying. "There are certain periods 
in my life when I'm terrified of flying," he says, "and that was one of them. 
But I think if I had been more courageous, I would have been able to do it. But 
it was something that I partially could not accept. At that age, so much power 
and so much inspiration about to expire. I couldn't face it." 
</P>
<P>
AN INABILITY TO FACE his anxieties and fears is not a trait people usually 
associate with Scorsese. Behind his edgy New York persona is a scaldingly 
honest penchant for self-appraisal, one that permeates his work. When "Mean 
Streets" came out, Pauline Kael called it a "triumph of personal filmmaking." 
Even "New York, New York," which started out as a harmless showbiz musical, 
became a tortured elegy on the impossibility of mixing marriage and career -- a 
dominant theme in Scorsese's life at the time. In "Raging Bull," "The Last 
Temptation of Christ" and even the "Life Lessons" segment of "New York 
Stories," his internal struggles -- with his own destructive tendencies, his 
spiritual doubts or his insecurities -- are right up there on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Using his work as a kind of personal psychotherapy often leaves him emotionally 
delicate, which takes its toll on his non-professional life. A well-trained 
Catholic, he has a large capacity for guilt and suffering. When his three-year 
marriage to model-actress Isabella Rossellini fell apart in the early 1980s, 
Scorsese told film critic Roger Ebert that not only was he unable to look at 
ads or movies that featured Rossellini because "it was just too painful," but 
he was also unable to watch movies starring Nastassia Kinski because of her 
resemblance to Rossellini. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been periods of "excess" in his social life, Scorsese's 
alliances are now largely restricted to a small circle of close friends. His 
third and current wife, Barbara DeFina, produced "The Last Temptation of 
Christ" and was executive producer on "GoodFellas," and many of his friendships 
are inextricably connected to his work. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Keitel, a kindred soul who has appeared in five of Scorsese's movies, 
once described their relationship as "like walking into a room . . . and 
looking into a woman's eyes. She looks back, and for whatever reasons, you both 
know it's something special." At times, Keitel and others have been willing to 
take sizable salary deferments when working with Scorsese in an effort to keep 
budgets down and get his movies made. 
</P>
<P>
In "GoodFellas," Scorsese may not plumb the depths of his psyche, but there is 
still that personal connection. As with much of his work, he says his affinity 
for the material stemmed from childhood memories. He remembers the "good 
fellas," or Mafiosi, in Little Italy as princely figures, with the best cars, 
the best clothes and the most glamorous women. His movie dotes on the 
accouterments of the gangster's life in extravagant detail. 
</P>
<P>
But if you expect a romanticization of the lifestyle in the manner of the 
"Godfather" movies, you've got the wrong director. The point of "GoodFellas" 
seems to be that the attractions of gangsterism are illusory. "Ultimately," 
Scorsese states flatly, "the lifestyle leads to disintegration and death. It 
just does." 
</P>
<P>
With a large cast, the acting in "GoodFellas" is of the ensemble variety, which 
at times creates the feeling of an epic home movie. Even De Niro, who gets top 
billing, does not dominate. Nor does Ray Liotta, whose character serves as the 
focus for the action. 
</P>
<P>
One scene involves a memorable moment by De Niro, who plays Jimmy Conway, the 
only Irish gangster in a group of Italians. Conway's gang has recently pulled 
off a lucrative heist, and in order to keep from getting caught, Conway has 
been systematically eliminating his fellow gang members. While standing in a 
bar, drink in hand, the camera tracks toward De Niro-Conway while the 
voice-over narration tells us of Jimmy's mounting paranoia. The camera lingers 
on De Niro's face, and we see him come to the realization that another of his 
associates must be killed. 
</P>
<P>
It is a subtle, powerful actor's moment, the kind many viewers have come to 
expect from De Niro and Scorsese. Scorsese is cagey about his relationship with 
the actor, saying only that what happens between a director and any actor is 
private. In any event, "GoodFellas," he cautions, given its ensemble nature, is 
not a "major collaboration" between the two. 
</P>
<P>
One aspect of "GoodFellas" that may surprise people who have come to know and 
appreciate Scorsese's work is the film's absence of spirituality. Many of his 
past movies have been populated by characters best understood in a religious 
context. In "GoodFellas," the characters have no comprehension of the spiritual 
hell in which they are trapped. There is no internal struggle. The inevitable 
result of this spiritual alienation is violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about pursuing the American Dream," says Scorsese, with a shrug. "And 
what happens when things don't turn out like you planned." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, what might disturb viewers most about the violence in 
"GoodFellas" is that it's so unnervingly funny. Many will call the film a black 
comedy because of its unusual mixture of humor and near-slapstick mayhem. The 
starkest example of this is its opening, pre-title scene, a giddily shocking 
bit of brutality that culminates with the film's tag line, spoken in voice-over 
by Ray Liotta: "As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a 
gangster." 
</P>
<P>
When Scorsese is told the film's opening might be the most dynamic since Sam 
Fuller's "The Naked Kiss," he laughs. "Come on now, 'The Naked Kiss'! That's 
the ultimate." 
</P>
<P>
Fuller is one of Scorsese's major influences, and the opening of "The Naked 
Kiss" is one of the most startling in movie history. While loud, frenetic jazz 
music plays, a tall, blond hooker whips the daylights out of her pimp with a 
telephone. The pimp reaches up and pulls her wig off -- and then it's a bald 
hooker whipping the daylights out of her pimp. 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese is excited now, his eyes twinkling as they often do when he talks 
about movies he loves. "But you haven't seen 'The Street of No Return.' It's 
Fuller's latest picture. We hope to get it here in America in January or 
February. The opening may be as strong as 'The Naked Kiss.' " 
</P>
<P>
Really? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, maybe. But there's not a woman in it. That's why I think 'The Naked 
Kiss' is still the strongest opening." 
</P>
<P>
A bald woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. A baldheaded woman. You know, I don't even want to begin to question 
what that might be all about." 
</P>
<P>
SCORSESE'S DEEP, impassioned affection for movies and his willingness to invest 
so much of his inner life into his own filmmaking beg the question: What 
becomes of a little boy who is already story-boarding at the age of 8? 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese's total immersion in the culture of cinema, both as a viewer and a 
filmmaker, often amazes those who know him. Mention any obscure film, American 
or otherwise, and he can probably tell you the director, the studio and the 
year it was made. Since 1980, much of his free time has been devoted to the 
issue of film preservation, in an attempt to save color films of the '40s and 
'50s from falling into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
Now, his days are consumed with preparing for his next project, an updated 
version of the 1962 film noir, "Cape Fear." After that he will be working again 
with Winkler on a long-planned film biography of George and Ira Gershwin, which 
promises to satisfy once again his fondness for period recreations. 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese's total love of film is apparent in his work. When combined with his 
penchant for intense personal exploration -- and his ability to weave it all 
into the tapestry of his stories -- his best movies exist, for many, on a kind 
of transcendental level far above the commercial fray. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, a downside to all this, one that Scorsese sometimes 
appears reluctant to accept. When asked on the "American Masters" profile 
broadcast last July whether or not his entire life was rooted in film, he got 
testy. "Doesn't that make you a one-sided person?" he snapped. "It's just 
ridiculous, don't you think? If all I know is film, what other interest is 
there? Why are you talking to me? How could you be interested in what I'm 
saying? I have some thoughts about life, people, also." 
</P>
<P>
Now, in his office weeks later, Scorsese is less defensive. The words 
"spirituality" and "salvation" pop up in his conversation a lot and it becomes 
clear that for him filmmaking has become a kind of religion. He willingly 
admits that, in retrospect, he may well have become involved in making movies 
for the same reasons he initially studied for the priesthood. "I didn't set out 
specifically saying that I can put whatever emotions or passions I had for the 
priesthood into filmmaking. That happened. Would the same themes and ideas that 
I was interested in come across in theology or in preparatory seminaries? 
Possibly, I don't know. But evidently, yeah, they've stayed for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The key to understanding his theology, Scorsese says, is the English director 
Michael Powell. Like Cassavetes, Powell helped Scorsese comprehend his own 
all-consuming love of film. And, like Cassavetes, the 84-year-old Powell died 
recently, leaving a void in Scorsese's life. A vastly intelligent and erudite 
thinker, Powell was once quoted in an interview as saying: "I am not just a 
director with a personal style; I am cinema." 
</P>
<P>
When he is asked to interpret that remark, Scorsese grows quiet. One can hear 
horns honking and sirens wailing through Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough one to interpret," he finally answers. "You see, Michael 
understood movies, things that moved; that was the idea. Pictures that moved. 
Remember I told you I was always attracted to shots before lighting, the 
movement of the camera or the non-movement of the camera? We were both 
attracted to that. . . ." Scorsese is talking even faster now, with emotion in 
his voice. "And at a certain point, you can actually feel it go through your 
body. It's part of you. And sometimes, when it all comes together on the set, 
and especially when it comes together in the cutting room, it becomes part of 
you. It's like it just seeps out of your body. And you become what you're -- 
you become the film you're making." 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese's voice trails off. Maybe it's just that it's late in the interview, 
but he seems almost embarrassed, as if he has revealed too much of himself. 
Undoubtedly, he is aware of the implications of what he is saying -- the 
implied loneliness and isolation. The alienation. 
</P>
<P>
I am cinema. For a man who claimed it was a hard statement to interpret, 
Scorsese appears to comprehend its meaning implicitly, almost as if he'd said 
it himself.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE STATE OF THE EARTH ATLAS EDITED BY JONI SEAGER

This atlas of environmental problems is more interesting for the way the 
authors slant the information toward the "Green" point of view than for the 
data it offers. Despite the blurb on the cover about being up to date, some of 
the information is no longer valid: Love Canal is described as "uninhabitable," 
although homes there were recently approved for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the authors' assertions would be difficult to defend in a serious 
debate: "The deterioration of the global environment has less to do with 
population growth than with industrial economies and priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Editor Joni Seager and the various contributors often seem so eager to score 
ideological points that they blithely present untenable propaganda as fact. The 
destruction of endangered species is described as a "male activity" because 
most hunters are men and "it is men who purchase the animals and their 
by-products." Which gender wears more fur coats, exotic leather, ivory jewelry 
and feathers? 
</P>
<P>
The rhetorical overkill in "The State of the Earth Atlas" may ultimately harm 
the Green cause by fueling the anti-conservationist contention that 
environmental activists exaggerate the gravity of the ecological crisis.

'HIPPER-THAN-THOU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawrence S. Dietz's Aug. 19 review of John Gregory Dunne's "Crooning" reveals 
more inadvertently about contemporary magazine writing than its author actually 
says. From his 10-ton name-drop lead (". . . Tom Wolfe and I got to talking . . 
.") to his oh-so-knowing asides about "a 1979 Lafite Rothschild" being "too 
young to drink," Dietz airs only the views of the hipper-than-thou. 
</P>
<P>
Who's in? Who's out? Or, "Who's hot -- Who's not?" as US likes to put it -- 
that's the preoccupation of most current magazine writers, and of most current 
magazine publishers. Fame, L.A. Style, Vanity Fair, Entertainment -- what's all 
this about? How long till somebody publishes Ego, the Journal of Contemporary 
Self-Aggrandizement? 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the writers for these magazines regularly sacrifice thought, 
inspiration, instruction and enlightenment to a higher authority: the Bitchy 
Quip. No matter how stylish, no matter how ephemerally entertaining, such a 
writer ends up nothing but a quippy bitch. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, Dietz is right. It's a terrible way to make a living.

UNDERSTANDING IRAQ

<P>
Your Endpapers ("How Mesopotamia Became Iraq (and Why It Matters)" by Jack 
Miles, Sept. 2) was a very comprehensive analysis of the situation of the Arabs 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Western World probably still does not understand what Miles put into one 
sentence -- that for Muslims, religion and politics are inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
You also quoted David Fromkin: "Arab Muslims simply were unwilling to be ruled 
by this European, Christian, culturally alien power." 
</P>
<P>
This has always been true, and to be completely pragmatic, it should have 
guided several generations of so-called world leaders.

An enormous number of trained observers (astronomers, pilots, police) have seen 
UFOs in daylight, and very close, so that there was no mistaking the craft for 
swamp gas or Venus. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the government's chief advocate, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, 
switched sides. 
</P>
<P>
Take "The Gulf Breeze Sightings" by Ed and Frances Walters. Klass alleges that 
the photos therein are fakes, even though the book contains extensive expert 
analysis to the contrary. Some photos were taken with a tamper-proof camera, 
were taken in the presence of others and were shot by other than the authors. 
There were also 200 eyewitnesses, so the photography issue is irrelevant.

In his review of "Out There," Klass mentions the photos of Floridian Ed 
Walters. 
</P>
<P>
Walters' 1990 book, "The Gulf Breeze Sightings," contains color photographs 
that show a brilliant, fiery "power ring" or energy source under the saucer as 
well as a blue beam flashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I think that the numerous sightings, photographs and films from 
around the world over the past 40 or so years suggest that the UFOs came in 
order to patrol (like observers or guardians) our planet, to be seen by and to 
enlighten us, and to intervene in order to overcome and protect human beings 
from the disastrous effects of a large-scale nuclear war in the Middle East and 
involving several nations.

ON A MILD Southern California day in late October, 1988, California Highway 
Patrol "green cop" Sgt. Lance Erickson swung his unmarked Chevy into a parking 
lot in an industrial section of Garden Grove. The space was adjacent to the 
parking lot of the Laminating Co. of America, a firm that manufactures backings 
for circuit boards. Erickson's partner, CHP investigator Gary Hanson, was 
perched on a nearby rooftop, where he had a clear view of the firm's entrance 
and yard. The officers, members of the Los Angeles County Environmental Crimes 
Strike Force, had tailed Raymond Franco to this business. Now they waited to 
see what he would do next. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Erickson and Hanson had staked out hundreds of suspects, always 
on the lookout for the same thing: an "open window" -- copspeak for the 
opportunity to catch someone committing a crime. In this case, the alleged 
crime was the illegal transport and disposal of hazardous materials: Franco was 
a suspected "wastelord," a trafficker in a hot Southern California commodity -- 
toxic trash. It was now Day 2 of the surveillance, and the officers, armed with 
cameras, were a little restless: So far, Franco had done nothing suspicious, 
let alone criminal. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as Erickson and Hanson watched from their vantage points, the window to 
the Franco case blew wide open. Franco and some helpers began loading obviously 
full 55-gallon barrels -- the kind commonly used to store hazardous waste -- 
into two enclosed trucks. They carefully covered the barrels with cardboard, 
wood and empty drums. By the time the men were done, the full barrels were 
completely out of sight. "The trucks were plated out of the country; all the 
labor was Mexican," Hanson explains. "It gave me the suspicion that (the 
barrels) might not be staying in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, Erickson and other green cops in Southern California had long believed 
that some unscrupulous American companies and waste haulers were dumping their 
toxic waste south of the border. Pursuing smuggling cases, however, had proved 
to be all but impossible. Investigators needed a solid lead and compelling 
evidence, and, to get it, they needed the assistance and resources of agencies 
much bigger than the county strike force. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers had scant time to consider the ramifications of what they were 
witnessing. They simply knew they were onto something. "We took over 300 
photos," Erickson says. "I was throwing film up to Gary on the roof. It was 
amazing; it was developing right in front of our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
As the trucks pulled out of the laminating plant yard, Erickson and Hanson 
scrambled for their cars and followed the trucks out onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT officials predict that the clandestine export of hazardous 
waste will become the international crime of the 1990s -- a problem as big as 
arms or drugs trafficking. The lethal byproducts of industrialization, they 
say, move across the globe on toxic trails that lead from the developed nations 
to an unknowing and ill-prepared Third World. Among the poison routes, one of 
the easiest to follow is Interstate 5, down the center of California to San 
Ysidro and across the border into Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
William Carter, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney specializing in 
environmental crimes, chooses his words carefully when he talks about the 
toxic-waste traffic to Mexico. Each day, more than 100,000 vehicles cruise down 
I-5 and cross the border. Carter is reluctant to guess how much toxic waste 
slips south. "I wouldn't call it a trickle. I wouldn't call it a flood. I think 
it's more of a steady stream," he says. When pushed, he will estimate perhaps 
tens of thousands of gallons a month. 
</P>
<P>
Carter is sitting in his office in the county Hall of Records in downtown Los 
Angeles. On one wall, a reprint of a full-page newspaper advertisement, part of 
the punishment for one environmental offender, reads "I Got Caught." Like CHP 
officers Erickson and Hanson, Carter is a member of the Los Angeles County 
Environmental Crimes Strike Force -- a kind of SWAT team drawn from about a 
dozen state and county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Carter says, is simple. Southern California produces about 
two-thirds of the state's toxic garbage. In 1988, almost 1 million tons of 
hazardous waste was produced in the region, according to state health 
department statistics. With landfills closing and disposal costs running as 
high as $1,000 a barrel, the area has become a toxic pressure cooker. For some, 
the temptation to dump waste illegally, both inside California and across the 
border, where regulations and enforcement are less stringent, is hard to 
resist. Dishonest waste haulers and companies, Carter adds, consider Mexico "a 
big trash can." 
</P>
<P>
It's an offensive crime, he says. "As human beings, we should care about what 
happens to people down there. . . . Toxic waste is a time bomb. It may go off 
20 years from now, but it's no less serious than someone planting a bomb." Such 
actions will return to haunt us: "It's going to come back to us in some way -- 
air pollution, water pollution . . . the products we buy." 
</P>
<P>
And the "steady stream," Carter says, shows no signs of slowing. "It's like 
with drugs," he says, almost philosophically. "You can go up to the corner of 
Broadway and you can get crack any time you want to -- if there's no cop 
there." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Customs Service officials, who concentrate on looking for weapons, drugs 
and illegal immigrants coming north, don't always check the southbound traffic 
at the border crossing. And when they do, concedes Customs Service spokeswoman 
Bobbie Cassidy, they lack the expertise and on-site testing equipment they need 
to identify hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection Agency, the federal 
entity charged with policing hazardous waste, is stretched even thinner: It has 
only one agent and two investigators to enforce environmental statutes in four 
Western states, as well as the far-flung U.S. territories of the Pacific. "What 
can I do?" asks David Wilma, a special agent with the EPA's office of criminal 
investigations in San Francisco. "I've got people screaming at me to go to Guam 
and look at what's going on there. . . . The job is so massive . . . I could 
keep 10 or 20 people busy." 
</P>
<P>
That leaves state and local enforcers, such as the 9-year-old L.A. strike 
force. Working undercover, conducting border roadblocks, setting up sting 
operations and prosecuting cases vigorously, the strike force has compiled an 
impressive record. Carter runs through some of the team's recent successes. It 
put away the Pantilat brothers, who ran a plating business in North Hollywood 
and repeatedly poured cyanide-laced waste water down the sewer. And in the case 
of a toxic cloud caused by leaking barrels of chlorine waste, the strike force 
nailed a manufacturer of swimming-pool products called Grow Group Inc.; the 
company was fined more than $850,000, and the president and vice president of 
the consumer products division at that time were sentenced to six-month prison 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few months ago, however, the strike force had never cracked a smuggling 
case, let alone landed a conviction. "We heard rumors," Carter says. "We had 
circumstantial evidence." But they didn't have solid leads. They needed to 
trace the waste from its American source to its Mexican dumping ground, and to 
do that, they had to be able to cross the border with it. 
</P>
<P>
"We could only do so much," he says. "We couldn't extend our jurisdiction 
across the border. Smuggling was bigger than our resources in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
It became clear that the strike force would need assistance to cross 
jurisdictional boundaries to solve the case. "We're trying to investigate and 
prosecute cases that involve L.A. County regardless of where they end up," 
Carter says. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN THE TWO TRUCKS left the laminating company in Garden Grove, one went 
south, the other north. Hanson followed the one going south; other strike-force 
members went north. The northbound trucker slipped away from his pursuers. "I 
didn't ask what happened," Hanson says now. "The officers came back with their 
tails between their legs." 
</P>
<P>
The southbound trucker was not so lucky. He was pulled off the road near San 
Juan Capistrano on the suspicion that he was illegally carrying hazardous 
material. Even if the strike force was correct and the truck was headed for 
Mexico, members knew they couldn't follow it across the border. And they didn't 
want the hazardous waste to get away. 
</P>
<P>
Lab samples later revealed that the hidden barrels contained flammable 
hazardous wastes -- a potential health and safety risk. Though authorities say 
they are not sure where the barrels originated, they determined that the 
driver, Arturo Carbajal Suarez, was not licensed by the California Department 
of Health Services to haul waste. He was arrested and charged with illegally 
transporting the barrels. Suarez told investigators that he had been ordered to 
take the barrels to Tijuana. He pleaded guilty and served several weeks in an 
Orange County jail. But the strike force still did not have a complete case. 
There were "other facts to check out and leads to follow," Carter explains. 
</P>
<P>
The strike force had had its eye on Raymond Franco, a licensed toxic-waste 
hauler, and his small El Toro operation -- Ray's Industrial Waste -- since the 
early 1980s, according to William Jones, a Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services strike-force member. The investigators knew that Franco had a 
criminal record, which included a conviction for the interstate transportation 
of a stolen vehicle. They also knew that on a typical day Franco could be found 
calling on companies that produced toxic waste and offering to take their 
poisonous problem off their hands and dispose of it, legally, at bargain rates. 
"He'd point out things that could be violations, and he'd say, 'I can turn you 
in to the EPA for that,' " explains Erickson, who interviewed many of Franco's 
clients. "He would say, 'I can show you how to do things right. Let me be your 
waste hauler. I'll take care of it for you.' " (Franco declined to be 
interviewed for this article.) 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Suarez helped the strike force make the next move in the investigation: 
a search of Raymond Franco's El Toro home, which also served as an office for 
Ray's Industrial Waste. A few weeks after the Garden Grove stakeout, a 
half-dozen CHP officers showed up at Franco's two-story, stucco townhouse in 
what Erickson calls a "kinda ritzy" neighborhood. Franco, a stout 58-year-old, 
was indignant. "I'm a businessman," Erickson remembers him saying while 
officers carted off all the documents they could find that dealt with 
hazardous-waste transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, the EPA's David Wilma contributed another solid lead. Wilma 
passed on a letter he had received from one of Franco's clients that eventually 
found its way to Hanson. In 1988, according to court records, Barmet Aluminum 
Corp., an Ohio-based firm with a plant in Torrance that paints recycled 
aluminum coils for wholesale distribution, made what seemed like a good 
business deal: For about $12,000, it hired Franco to dispose of 57 barrels of 
its hazardous waste. Although investigators estimated that to transport and 
dispose of Barmet's waste legally would have cost at least twice that amount, a 
company official said Barmet's owners believed they were hiring a reputable 
waste broker and paying a legitimate service fee. But the paperwork that was 
supposed to follow the waste through the disposal process, and ultimately be 
returned to Barmet, never came through. A Barmet official says that the 
hazardous-waste facilities that were supposed to receive the company's toxic 
trash from Franco never did. "What happened was, he defrauded us . . . (of) 
several thousand dollars," Jorge Eulloqui, Barmet's Torrance division plant 
manager told one interviewer. "We reported the matter to the EPA." 
</P>
<P>
The hazardous-waste manifests, or shipping documents, seized in El Toro 
confirmed that Franco wasn't very good with paperwork. "If Franco could get 
away with it," Hanson says, "he wouldn't file a manifest at all." They 
discovered other violations like the one Barmet reported: Some of the toxic 
waste picked up by Franco never went where it was supposed to go. It just 
"disappeared," Hanson says. 
</P>
<P>
Franco took on the Barmet job with a truck driver named David Torres, 
authorities learned. Torres' name had already come up: The plates on the truck 
that got away during the Garden Grove stakeout were traced to him. Torres, 39, 
lived part time in Huntington Park and part time in Mexico, where he owned a 
small pottery factory in Tijuana. Later, Torres would tell an interviewer that 
he hauled material for Franco when his regular business was slow. "I needed 
some money to survive," he explained in halting English. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme was simple. Torres said he would pick up drums for Franco, as he did 
at Garden Grove. In return, Franco paid him $30 a barrel for his services. "I 
just go to the back of the building and pick up the drums . . . with Franco," 
Torres said. "I don't know if I do something illegal." 
</P>
<P>
By early 1989, after months of scrutinizing Franco's and Torres' activities, 
Hanson says, he and Erickson thought they had "the smoking gun, the icing on 
the cake." Through a CHP connection, they had asked Mexican officials to check 
out Torres' pottery factory. The report that came back included a description 
of a sealed warehouse. Hanson and Erickson suspected that barrels of hazardous 
waste from the United States were inside. But because of what Hanson calls "a 
lot of red tape," it would be almost a year before he and other investigators 
found out for sure. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the CHP officers took their investigation to the Orange County 
District Attorney's Office because the alleged violations took place in its 
jurisdiction. As their investigation developed, however, it became apparent 
that what they had might be bigger -- a federal case. The CHP officers talked 
over the case with a federal prosecutor who told them they needed to find the 
last piece of the puzzle -- the location of the missing Barmet barrels. The 
FBI, the investigative arm of the U.S. Attorney's Office, could pull strings in 
Mexico that the county strike force could not. In late 1989, the federal 
authorities came through, and Mexican officials finally gave investigators the 
green light to search Torres' factory. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1990, several FBI agents and other investigators gathered outside 
the Torres pottery factory in a residential section of Tijuana. Some pulled on 
protective "moon suits" -- plastic coveralls and headgear, rubber boots and 
gloves. Inside the factory, next to rows of finished terra-cotta pots, they 
found a cache of rusting 55-gallon drums. Many of the drums bore labels 
identifying their contents as flammable waste, Hanson says, and some had serial 
numbers on them that matched Barmet's records of its missing containers. 
</P>
<P>
The barrels had long been exposed to the hot Baja temperatures. Some were 
dented and leaking inside the factory, which was just a few yards from an 
elementary school. "We couldn't account for all the missing barrels," says 
Hanson. "It's possible some were (emptied and) sold to locals." (Many poor 
Mexican families use discarded chemical drums -- which often contain poisonous 
residues -- to store drinking water.) 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say lab samples showed that the barrels contained mixtures of 
industrial solvents such as toluene, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, 
ethyl benzene and 1,1,1 trichloroethane. One concern was that these solvents 
were highly flammable. "The barrels could have . . . exploded and caused a 
fire," Hanson says. 
</P>
<P>
Another threat was more subtle. Industrial solvents have the potential to 
assault every human organ system, according to health experts. Acute or 
prolonged exposure to xylene can cause central nervous system damage, liver 
abnormalities and heart problems. Simply inhaling or handling methyl ethyl 
ketone can irritate the skin, eyes and throat. In addition, high-dose exposure 
to ethyl benzene can produce pulmonary edema (a potentially fatal buildup of 
fluid in the lungs). And 1,1,1 trichloroethane is suspected of having caused 
birth defects in places where it has leaked into the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA spent a total of $100,000 cleaning up the solvents. The Barmet barrels 
were removed in July, transferred into bigger barrels and sealed, then taken to 
a certified disposal facility in Southern California. Eventually, they were 
shipped to Texas for incineration. 
</P>
<P>
"Those barrels were just sitting in a warehouse, waiting for someone to fall 
into them or tip them over," says prosecutor William Carter. "We think such 
activity is a violent crime and people should pay for that crime with time in 
custody." 
</P>
<P>
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT to understand why companies might risk the illegal disposal 
of their hazardous waste. The problem is cost, according to Jack Rust, a 
73-year-old former chemical salesman and self-described environmental 
consultant who helps companies dispose of their hazardous materials. Rust's 
slicked-back white hair and polyester shirts make him look as though he stepped 
out of the '50s. In the late 1980s, Rust, while admitting no guilt, paid the 
EPA cleanup costs of $10,000 for what a court document called "corroded, 
distended and leaking" drums of toxic waste allegedly abandoned at the border. 
Rust, who strongly denies ever having been a waste dumper, acknowledges that in 
the past, waste generators had some "pretty bad" disposal practices -- methods 
that have been outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
He also can see why some firms turn to operators like Franco. Large firms have 
the money and personnel to find creative solutions to the problem; mom-and-pop 
shops do not. As a result, some small operators may find what Rust calls 
"ingenious" ways to dispose of waste, including hiring illegal dumpers or 
haulers whose licenses are in order but whose rates are way below the norm. A 
lot of people in the business, Rust says, "have been in jail and have paid huge 
fines." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Levy, owner of Gene's Plating Works in Boyle Heights, has another 
explanation for noncompliance. The laws about what is hazardous, and how it 
should be dealt with, are complex and changing all the time. "Philosophically, 
I'm all for compliance if it means a better standard of health for everyone," 
says Levy, a spokesman for the Metal Finishers Assn. of Southern California. 
"Who can be against that? It's apple pie and motherhood. But at the same time, 
the laws should be simple, easily understood, and they shouldn't cost too 
much." Reading and understanding the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, a 
federal law that regulates the cradle-to-grave fate of hazardous waste, was 
described by one court as a "mind-numbing journey." 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on businesses are only getting worse. Thousands of manufacturing 
firms and government agencies classified as hazardous-waste producers face 
strict new federal regulations that observers predict will jack up 
already-escalating disposal prices. "The average cost of getting rid of 
hazardous waste in landfills was about $225 (per barrel)," Rust says. But in 
May, the EPA announced rules for treating hazardous waste that, he says, will 
make prices "jump to $500 to $600 a drum." 
</P>
<P>
More disposal difficulties in Southern California mean more bad news in Mexico. 
Besides dumping more waste across the border as laws become more restrictive, 
companies will move, often to Mexico, smuggling their waste with them. The 
owner of a major furniture company in Los Angeles told Carter, "You're driving 
me to Mexico," after his company was cited and fined for disposal violations. 
Carter says the firm subsequently moved its plating facility to San Luis, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
American factories in Mexico are supposed to send their hazardous waste to the 
United States. But despite a 1983 agreement between the two countries, 
authorities fear that untreated chemical stews are widespread in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Some California firms have discovered ways to comply with the law and beat the 
high cost of disposal. Their solution is to cut down on the amount of hazardous 
waste generated in the first place. Since the early 1980s, Borden Chemical Co., 
a small Fremont firm that manufactures industrial resins and adhesives, has 
reduced contaminants in its waste water by 93%. In doing so, the firm, whose 
disposal costs had tripled in recent years, also has saved money. A company 
official estimates that it has saved more than $45,000 a year on disposal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Levy's medium-sized firm does decorative nickel and chrome plating. For the 
last four years, the operation has removed solid material from its waste water, 
selling it to an Arizona firm that then extracts from it metals that can be 
sold to refineries. Levy, who must remove any hazardous solids from his waste 
water to meet local restrictions, says his process is good for two reasons: 
"It's not hazardous, and the metals can be used by someone else. That's ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Levy says he hasn't saved any money for his trouble, but his disposal method is 
better than burying barrels of waste in the ground. "It's less of a risk," he 
says, "so that later, if there's a problem, the regulators won't come back to 
me and say, 'Harry Levy of Gene's Plating Works, you're going to have to clean 
this up, and it will cost you $77 million and your firstborn.' " 
</P>
<P>
While hazardous-waste experts and government officials point to such companies 
as role models, those firms are the exception, especially among small 
businesses. How many Southern California companies, eager to get rid of their 
waste, will be tempted to resort to suspiciously cheap waste haulers or simply 
pour their toxic waste down the sewer? The strike force has yet to see a drop 
in its caseload. Sgt. Lance Erickson sums it up this way: "The bottom line is 
money . . . the almighty buck." 
</P>
<P>
ON MAY9, Raymond Franco and David Torres were indicted in the first case in 
which felony charges for international waste smuggling have been filed under a 
U.S. environmental law. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act forbids, 
among other things, the transportation of hazardous waste to an unlicensed 
facility as well as the disposal of the material without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Franco was arrested in New York and charged with one count of conspiracy, six 
counts of illegal transportation, one count of illegal disposal, and one count 
of illegal export of hazardous waste. He pleaded not guilty and is due to go on 
trial Dec. 11. Currently free on bail, he faces a maximum sentence of 32 years 
in prison and a fine as high as $250,000 per count if convicted. Torres has not 
yet been apprehended. He had been questioned by authorities and interviewed in 
Burbank, but once the indictment was filed, he disappeared. He is believed to 
be hiding in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The Franco-Torres case called attention to the need for a way to cut through 
the bureaucracy that can hamper smuggling investigations. At the time of the 
indictment, county and federal officials announced the creation of a 
multi-agency Task Force on Environmental Prosecutions. "We're not by ourselves 
now, trying to trace everything that leaves L.A. County," Carter says. While 
the strike force continues to target illicit dumpers within its jurisdiction, 
he says, the task force stands ready to offer federal assistance when cases 
involve international violators. 
</P>
<P>
The task force includes the FBI, the EPA, the U.S. Attorney's Office, the CHP 
and state health department investigators, all working together to solve 
environmental crimes. A top priority of the group, officials say, is to crack 
down on the illegal export of hazardous waste from California to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the publicity and satisfaction of wrapping up the case, strike-force 
members aren't necessarily patting themselves on the back. The Franco-Torres 
cache, they know, is "small potatoes." But it has given investigators valuable 
insight into the illegal-waste trade between the United States and Mexico. The 
strike force is now in the thick of a new investigation, one that involves 
dozens of plating companies spinning their own toxic web to Tijuana. "When you 
(break a case), you realize how many others you're missing," says Adam Schiff, 
an assistant U.S. attorney who will be prosecuting the Franco-Torres case with 
Carter. "It's a huge problem, and it's going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the investigation represents a coup. "What was important was we obtained 
the evidence that Franco caused waste to be transported to Mexico," Carter 
says. "Now I think we finally have a handle on some of the players." 
</P>
<P>
Investigator Hanson agrees. The Franco-Torres case, he hopes, will help set up 
good case law "so that there are certain things you can assume when prosecuting 
these cases," he explains. "One day, it will be as easy to convict illegal 
dumpers as convicting drunk drivers or auto thieves." 
</P>
<P>
Illicit hazardous-waste traders, Hanson says matter-of-factly, are classic con 
artists: They try to take advantage of people, and they try to beat the system. 
He also levels a harsher accusation: "I think of these cases as investigating 
homicides. Only we're trying to break them 20 or 30 years in advance."

ARGENTINE PRESIDENTIAL AIDE SAYS HE SENT 154 TONS OF BEEF TO IRAQ

A presidential adviser said Saturday that he sent 154 tons of beef to Iraq 
through Iran in violation of Argentina's pledge to honor the U.N. trade 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The private shipment was paid for by Iraq and flown to Iran in two Boeing 727 
jets during the past 15 days, said the official, Alberto Samid, responding to 
newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine news agency Diario y Noticias quoted him as saying the beef was 
to be shipped by land into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it because I have family there, because I know there are hungry children 
. . . hungry old people . . . (and) hungry women who have nothing to do with 
the problem," said Samid, also a parliamentarian of the governing Peronist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Saul Menem was in the northwestern state of La Rioja and could 
not immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina has pledged to honor the U.N. trade embargo, and Menem has promised 
two warships to join an international naval force enforcing the embargo. Last 
week, Agriculture Secretary Felipe Sola said wheat sales to Iraq were cut off 
and the government took steps to assure that grain sold to Iran would not go to 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Before the cutoff, Argentina had sold 4 million tons of wheat a year to Iraq 
and worked on joint scientific projects that included the development of the 
medium-range Condor missile. 
</P>
<P>
Samid called Argentina's support for the gulf force "an error of our foreign 
policy."

Simcha Dinitz, a leading Israeli immigration official, said the government 
should seek at least $3 billion in grants from the United States and Germany to 
help pay the costs of absorbing Soviet Jews. Officials predict that an 
estimated 1 million Soviet Jews will arrive in Israel by the end of 1992, with 
more than 92,000 having arrived since the start of this year. Dinitz, chairman 
of the Jewish Agency, told Israel Radio that the Jewish community worldwide 
must make greater contributions and the government must tighten its belt to 
absorb the newcomers.

A Harlem grocery store manager was shot and killed by a customer Saturday in an 
argument over $1 worth of ham, police and family members said. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victim as Juan Peralta, 28. Theodore Rosa, the victim's 
nephew, said his uncle was working at about 3 a.m. when the gunman and a woman 
came in to purchase $1 worth of ham. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy says to him: 'That's not a dollar's worth,' " Rosa said. "And my uncle 
says: 'That's all I can give you for a dollar.' Then the guy called him 
outside."

POISONED SQUIRRELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weren't our state parks established to preserve our natural resources? I was 
shocked to read in The Times that park rangers at San Elijo State Park have 
poisoned and killed over three-fourths of the ground squirrel population at the 
park ("Poison Grain Keeps Underground Squirrels Under Control at Beach," Sept. 
13). 
</P>
<P>
Why should these animals be labeled as "pests" and exterminated? They are 
native to the area and have as much right as any other species to live in the 
park and to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't state park officials alert animal activist groups when the ground 
squirrel over-population problem was identified? Why didn't they invite these 
groups and concerned individuals to meet and discuss ways to trap and relocate 
the ground squirrels, or develop a chemosterilant as a birth control measure? 
</P>
<P>
With all the current interest in protecting native wildlife, surely ways could 
be found to deal with the problem without resorting to mass killing of the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
State parks officials should institute a program which requires them to notify 
animal activist and conservation groups whenever they identify a wildlife 
over-population problem. The arbitrary and crass mass killing of ground 
squirrels should not be repeated.

GROUND-LEVEL MONUMENTS HONOR HEROES OF THE AIR; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: FIVE PIONEERS RECEIVE A LASTING TRIBUTE AS THE FIRST TO BE ENSHRINED 
ON LANCASTER BOULEVARD'S AEROSPACE WALK OF HONOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone in the aeronautics community knew they had the right stuff, and now 
the city of Lancaster has made it official. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Yeager, Jimmy Doolittle, A. Scott Crossfield, Tony LeVier and Pete Knight 
-- pilots who achieved dizzying heights in the early days of flight testing -- 
on Saturday became the first to be honored on Lancaster's Aerospace Walk of 
Honor. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sure a different breed of cat from the rest of us," said George Root, 
vice mayor of Lancaster. "They're internationally known for taking phenomenal 
risks in one-of-a-kind aircraft to learn the planes' limits, and some of them 
did it right here in the Antelope Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after the Hollywood Walk of Fame and celebrity walks elsewhere, the 
sidewalk monument display has been shrouded in secrecy for months. Saturday 
morning, the five granite monuments were installed on Lancaster Boulevard, 
boxed in black crates and guarded by volunteers from the Civil Air Patrol. Each 
six-foot-tall, 675-pound monument bears a decorative, brushed aluminum 
medallion and the name of the recipient. The pilots' names were announced at a 
$50-a-plate dinner Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept it secret because we wanted to build excitement in the community, very 
much like the Academy Awards," said Nancy Walker, a spokeswoman for the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeager, the legendary combat and test pilot immortalized in Tom Wolfe's 
book "The Right Stuff," about the chutzpah of those pilots and astronauts, said 
in an interview last week that test pilots and movie stars are worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hell of a comparison -- Hollywood movie stars and us," Yeager, 67, 
said. "The test pilot lives a real life, not a fantasy. Basically, you have to 
remember, duty enters into it. That's paramount." 
</P>
<P>
Yeager in 1947 was the first pilot in the world to break the sound barrier, 
even though he had two broken ribs at the time. Knight, 61, set the world's 
speed record in 1967 by flying the X-15 at Mach 6, or 4,520 m.p.h., twice as 
fast as a .50-caliber bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the pilots, LeVier, 77, and Crossfield, 68, were civilians who helped 
design and test high-powered aircraft. Doolittle, 93, is a retired Air Force 
lieutenant general who made the first successful "blind," or instruments-only, 
flight in 1929. He is also renowned for voluntarily leading a raid by 16 B-25 
bombers against Tokyo on April 18, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Lancaster has spent about $60,000, not including labor costs of city 
employees, for the Walk of Honor and the hoopla surrounding it this weekend, 
Walker said. Champagne glasses embossed in gold with the image of a test pilot 
and gourmet chocolates stamped with the same picture were to be given out 
Saturday night at the black-tie dinner to the 200 or so guests, including state 
Controller Gray Davis. Each pilot was also to be presented with a silver medal 
hung from a ribbon in the style of the Olympics, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Today at 2 p.m., the monuments will be unveiled in a public ceremony at 
Lancaster Boulevard and Cedar Avenue, preceded by a private reception. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, more monuments will be added to the Walk of Honor, which local city 
and military officials hope will become an attraction for aerospace buffs who 
already come to the area to watch space shuttles and the B -- 2 Stealth bomber 
flights. They also plan to build a museum at Edwards Air Force Base and add 
other attractions to the area to create an "Aerospace Heritage Trail," similar 
to Boston's Liberty Trail. 
</P>
<P>
"The walk is something our children will be able to look at and understand that 
this is where the sound barrier was broken. This is what we accomplished," said 
Tom Smith, a spokesman for the Antelope Valley-based Society of Experimental 
Test Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
All of the pilots honored this weekend have flown at least once out of Edwards 
Air Force Base, located 30 miles northeast of Lancaster. The base, an important 
flight test center for decades, began attracting aerospace companies to the 
valley after World War II. Today, about 23% of the area's work force, or 16,250 
workers, are employed in the aerospace industry, according to the state 
Economic Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking for a way for many years to publicly tie Lancaster and 
Edwards Air Force Base together, because it's that bond that moved us away from 
agriculture to technology," Root said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeager said that, when he was stationed at Edwards in the late 1940s, he rarely 
visited Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just alfalfa fields. That's all it was. Now, Highway 14 between 6 and 9 
a.m. -- you just don't hack it," he said, denying that he hot-rodded on the 
wide-open roads of his era. In "The Right Stuff," Wolfe described the fliers 
engaging in "the military tradition of Flying &amp; Drinking and Driving &amp; 
Drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Yeager and the other pilots have been enshrined in the National Aviation Hall 
of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, the Wright Brothers' hometown, said spokeswoman Kim 
Bramlage. But the Hall of Fame has been operating out of a tiny office in 
Dayton's convention center since the center was remodeled a few years ago. All 
the pilots' portraits, plaques and gold medals are in storage until the 
nonprofit organization can raise $12 million for a new home for the Hall of 
Fame, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of heritage lost over the years," said Doug Nelson, 
spokesman for the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum, which will open in 
temporary quarters at Edwards next year. "These guys sat in cramped cockpits, 
all hot and sweaty, and took enormous risks. They're worth honoring in the 
walk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 WITH THE RIGHT STUFF 
</P>
<P>
James H. (Jimmy) Doolittle, 93 
</P>
<P>
Known as the granddaddy of test pilots. Played a leading role in developing 
aircraft instruments and made the first successful "blind" or instruments-only 
flight in 1929. Won a Medal of Honor for voluntarily leading a raid by 16 B-25 
bombers against Tokyo on April 18, 1942. A retired Air Force lieutenant 
general, Doolittle lives in Pebble Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony W. (Tony) LeVier, 77 
</P>
<P>
Made more maiden flights on untested aircraft than any other pilot. During 30 
years of testing for Lockheed, he invented several safety and performance 
devices, including the Master Caution Warning Light system still in use today. 
Piloted the first flight to exceed 1,000 m.p.h. in a jet-powered aircraft. He 
lives in La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. (Chuck) Yeager, 67 
</P>
<P>
Legendary combat and test pilot immortalized in Tom Wolfe's book "The Right 
Stuff." First pilot in the world to break the sound barrier (1947), even though 
he had two broken ribs at the time. Logged more than 10,000 hours in 180 
different military aircraft. Now a retired Air Force brigadier general, Yeager 
lives in Cedar Ridge, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A. Scott Crossfield, 68 
</P>
<P>
First test pilot to reach Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound, in 1953. Made 
more rocket-powered flights than any pilot in history. Helped design the X-15, 
the world's fastest, highest-flying, rocket-powered plane, for North American 
Aviation. He lives in Fairfax County, Va. 
</P>
<P>
William J. (Pete) Knight, 61 
</P>
<P>
Set the world's speed record in 1967 by flying the X-15 at Mach 6, or 4,520 
m.p.h., twice as fast as a .50-caliber bullet. One of only eight pilots to earn 
his astronaut's wings by flying the X-15 above 50 miles into space. A retired 
Air Force colonel, he became the first elected mayor of Palmdale in 1988.

WEDDING PARTY BELLY-DANCES DOWN THE AISLE; 
</P>
<P>
NUPTIALS: THE BRIDE WEARS WHITE, BUT HER BRIDESMAIDS SPORT THE CHIC OF ARABY IN 
A MIDDLE EASTERN-THEMED CEREMONY.

<P>
With a wedding like this, who needs a bachelor party? 
</P>
<P>
The bridesmaids were belly dancers, clad in Hollywood-glitzy versions of 
traditional Arabic costumes -- brightly colored brocade caftans, gauzy harem 
pants and skirts, sashes, revealing Choli tops and chains and belts dripping 
with coins and semiprecious stones. 
</P>
<P>
With their hands above their heads, clinking finger cymbals, they languidly 
danced down the aisle toward the gazebo where, on Saturday, Siegfried Heep, 31, 
married Denise Russo, 40. Russo herself is a belly dancer and has been a member 
of the Van Nuys-based dance group Perfumes of Araby for more than a decade. 
When she and Heep decided to marry, she asked him if the wedding could have an 
Arabian Nights theme. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to do the same thing as everyone else," Russo said after a 
minister performed a brief wedding ceremony at The Odyssey restaurant in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Heep, a video engineer who met Russo when she was a student in a video class he 
taught at a community college, agreed to the request. 
</P>
<P>
Heep, of Van Nuys, wore white pants, shirt and a turban evocative of Lawrence 
of Arabia, and Russo, also of Van Nuys, wore a traditional white dress that had 
a few touches reminiscent of the Middle East. But it was the bridesmaids -- 
members of Russo's dance troupe -- who attracted much of the attention with 
their brightly colored, seductive garb. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of Russo's East Coast relatives were shocked at the idea of belly 
dancers in a wedding processional and incense burning during the ceremony, her 
sister Nadine Russo said the unconventional wedding fit the bride perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see her having this any other way," Nadine Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
Nadine Russo said her sister has always been drawn to the mysterious allure of 
ancient Arabia, although the family's heritage is half-Spanish and 
half-Italian. As a girl, Denise Russo decorated her room with red carpet, red 
velveteen wallpaper and a red bed. She also studied Arabic briefly, her sister 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But it is belly-dancing that has captured her fancy and held her attention. 
Denise Russo said she began taking lessons nearly 15 years ago, after seeing 
Perfumes of Araby perform. She later joined the troupe. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, some of the guests joked good-naturedly about the irony of 
a Middle Eastern-themed wedding at a time when the prospect of a war with Iraq 
looms large. 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of OPEC, I'd like to welcome you," Heep's turbaned best man greeted 
one guest. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the titillating costumes and the suggestive dancing of the 
bridesmaids, the best man admitted, "We still gave him a bachelor's party."

MEND MARKS 20 YEARS OF VOLUNTEERS PATCHING TOGETHER LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago, three families who wanted to help the poor in the 
northeastern San Fernando Valley started food pantries in their garages. 
</P>
<P>
From those humble beginnings, the fledgling charity the families named MEND 
(Meet Each Need with Dignity) has grown into one of the most active 
organizations providing for the emergency needs of the northeast Valley's poor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just boomed," said Marianne Haver Hill, the organization's executive 
director. "There just is really such a desperate need out there." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 400 MEND volunteers distributed food, clothing, furniture and other 
services to 40,000 people -- all without any government funding. Just five 
years ago, 200 volunteers served only 7,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
And, Hill said, she expects the number of people served to reach 50,000 by the 
end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The organization will mark its 20th year with a community open house from 1 to 
4 p.m. today at its renovated two-story headquarters, 13460 Van Nuys Blvd., 
Pacoima. On display will be the group's huge food storage warehouse, its neatly 
arranged racks of clothing, its furniture storeroom and its four classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the community to see what we're all about," Hill said. "This is an 
organization of ordinary citizens who care about the poor. MEND is still very 
much a grass-roots organization and we want to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
MEND's $420,000 annual budget comes from donations by individuals, churches, 
schools and civic organizations. Despite its growth over the years, the 
organization is still run primarily by volunteers. Five full-time and four 
part-time workers are the organization's only paid staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Hill described both board members and volunteers as "middle-class working 
people -- not even upper middle-class." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very different from the norm," said Ed Rose of Mission Hills, one of the 
organization's founders who remains active in MEND. "We wanted to make sure at 
least one person was home whenever there was a need," he said of the group's 
early days of operating out of garages. His wife, Carolyn, is president of the 
group's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, many other storefront charities on Van Nuys Boulevard in 
Pacoima have closed down, because of either a lack of funding or volunteers. 
But MEND has continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"The basis of the whole organization is that it has been blessed with a 
tremendous amount of caring people who don't have any sort of hidden agenda," 
Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of MEND's clients are among the working poor or people who are temporarily 
down on their luck, Hill said. Many are recent immigrants from Mexico and 
Central America who pay high rents to live in garages, shacks or crowded 
trailers. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if both the mother and father are working, there often is nothing left 
over for food or clothing with 70% to 85% of the family's income going toward 
rent," Hill said. "Others who come to us for help have been temporarily laid 
off from their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Most clients are referred to MEND by churches or by their neighbors. All are 
interviewed to determine and verify their needs, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to basic needs, it is the "little extras" that MEND volunteers give 
to the people they serve that makes the organization special, said Gina Leita, 
MEND's food services coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"About two months ago, a man came here for food for his family one day," she 
said. "His nose was bleeding. We called and couldn't find any hospital or 
clinic that would take him. Finally, one of our volunteers took him to Olive 
View, where he sat with the man for seven hours." 
</P>
<P>
Leita said doctors immediately diagnosed the man, only 25, as having leukemia, 
hospitalized him and gave him blood transfusions. "When the hospital wanted 
replacement blood, five of our volunteers immediately donated blood." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the volunteers' acts of selflessness involve tragedies. Some are 
merely opportunities to bring a moment of happiness into someone's life. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Leita keeps a freezer filled with decorated birthday cakes to add 
to grocery boxes for a child's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see a woman is pregnant, I stick some vitamins in with the basics," said 
Leita, herself a former MEND client. 
</P>
<P>
"I was divorced, hurting and had no job," Leita said last week as she 
supervised the unloading of a truck of groceries picked up by MEND volunteers 
at a local supermarket. "A friend brought me here." 
</P>
<P>
Through MEND, Leita was able to find a job and a woman with whom to share a 
house. She said she was so appreciative of the help she received that she was a 
full-time volunteer for two years while working the night shift as a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, MEND volunteers also have located a prom dress for a teen-ager 
whose family couldn't afford one, provided food for a quinceanera party for a 
dying teen-ager and helped a woman whose alcoholic husband was in jail start 
her own flower-arranging business. 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with most charitable organizations, MEND always needs more 
donations and more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Peter Kirby, a retired film editor who serves as MEND's volunteer 
furniture coordinator, said he has a huge list of people who want to donate 
items, but no one to pick them up. Volunteers also are needed to pick up food 
donated by area supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"I could also use some refrigerators," Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need volunteer teachers, and they don't have to be teachers," Hill added. 
"One of our best teachers is an auto mechanic." 
</P>
<P>
Rose said he would eventually like to see more emphasis on education at MEND. 
</P>
<P>
"A long-term goal is to help people become more educated to help themselves," 
he said.

Five more representatives and a lobbyist were charged Friday in South 
Carolina's growing statehouse scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Thomas Limehouse, Ennis Fant, Larry Blanding, B. J. Gordon and Donna A. 
Moss were named in a federal indictment growing from the FBI sting into the 
state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Limehouse, the only Republican in the group, was charged in a three-count 
indictment of two violations of the Hobbs Act, the federal anti-bribery law, 
for allegedly accepting $2,000, conspiracy to accept cash and an additional 
obstruction of justice charge. 
</P>
<P>
Fant, Blanding and Gordon were charged together in one count of conspiracy to 
violate the Hobbs Act, and each was charged separately with accepting bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Moss was charged with possession of cocaine during the 1989 legislative 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged was lobbyist James Madison Brown V, on one count of possession of 
marijuana in September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments have come as the result of an FBI sting, nicknamed "Operation 
Lost Trust," which probed vote-buying in the General Assembly. Of five other 
legislators charged last month, three have pleaded guilty and another is 
expected to plead guilty this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbs Act carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 
fine.

ENROLLMENT JUMPS 7% AT VENTURA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura College's enrollment for the fall semester has jumped by more than 7% 
over last year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Registration figures show that 12,393 students have enrolled, a 7.14% increase 
over the 11,567 students who enrolled by mid-September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the increase in enrollment can be attributed in part to the rising 
cost of an education at the university level," said John Woolley, vice 
president for student services. "Ventura College has proven itself to be very 
affordable."

SURROGATE-BORN BABY NOW WITH GENETIC PARENTS

<P>
The child born to surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson, a boy who was delivered 
into the eye of a legal and emotional hurricane four days ago, went home to his 
genetic parents Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The infant's departure from the hospital was as unusual as his test-tube 
conception, his gestation in the womb of a hired surrogate, and his birth into 
a potentially precedent-setting custody dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The still-unnamed newborn left St. Joseph Hospital in Orange at 10:15 a.m., 
carried out the front doors by a pediatric nurse in a green scrub suit and 
flanked by a uniformed police officer, a clutch of hospital officials and the 
baby's court-appointed guardian, William Steiner. The infant, wrapped in a 
striped blanket, was swept past a bank of reporters and photographers and 
loaded into a borrowed infant seat in Steiner's car. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner drove the child to the home of Mark and Crispina Calvert, the Orange 
County couple who hired Johnson to bear their baby. Crispina Calvert, 36, said 
that when Steiner pulled into the driveway, her husband could no longer wait 
inside. The 34-year-old insurance underwriter ran to the front door and out 
onto the steps, smiling and extending his arms so Steiner could hand him the 
still-sleeping baby. 
</P>
<P>
After he crossed the threshold of the Calverts' home, the infant's life began 
to look a little more traditional. A houseful of relatives leaned over him, 
talking baby talk and watching rapturously as his diaper was changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just so jubilant we have our child," Calvert said. "We appreciate Anna 
Johnson's consideration and we're extremely grateful for her compassion in this 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was staying with friends in Mission Viejo, waited patiently until 
late Saturday afternoon, when she and her 3-year-old daughter, Erica, visited 
the baby at the Calverts' home. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner, who will monitor Johnson's visits with the baby, said the session was 
"tense and awkward at first" but went "fine" after that. As an icebreaker, 
Johnson gave the Calverts a rum cake. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of got the feeling that this baby was . . . the peacemaker," Steiner 
said. "The attention just focused on the baby and away from all the acrimony 
and problems. 
</P>
<P>
"She changed the baby and held the baby and the baby slept a good part of the 
time," Steiner continued, adding that Johnson spent some time alone with the 
infant and also visited with the Calverts, discussing the baby's birth. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also had pictures taken of herself with the baby, just as the Calverts 
had done in the hospital the night he was born. 
</P>
<P>
Looking upbeat after the visit, Johnson smiled but would only say she was 
"fine" as she left the home. Johnson's attorney, who drove her to the home, 
said he wanted to respect the Calverts' privacy and preferred that she not 
comment after the visit. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Johnson -- who is battling the Calverts for shared custody 
-- who made certain that the baby went home with the couple. 
</P>
<P>
During a five-hour session with a judge Friday, the parties could not agree on 
who should take the infant home temporarily, until another custody hearing 
could be held. When her lawyer called her at the hospital to say that the judge 
was about to place the boy in a foster home for a short while, Johnson decided 
that it was better for the baby to be with the Calverts. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's attorney, Richard C. Gilbert, said he plans to seek an order from the 
state Court of Appeal Wednesday or Thursday placing the baby with Johnson and 
declaring that she has parental rights equal to those of the Calverts. If the 
court agrees to hear the case, a custody hearing Thursday in Orange County 
Superior Court would be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, is the first surrogate mother to ask a judge to declare that she 
is the legal parent of a child that is not genetically related to her. She 
agreed to be implanted with an embryo made from the Calverts' sperm and egg. 
She later backed out of the $10,000 contract and sought to keep the child, 
saying the Calverts had neglected her during pregnancy and would make unfit 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts are unable to bear children because Crispina Calvert's uterus had 
to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said Johnson, a single mother, rode home from the hospital in silence 
Friday night and was in an emotionally delicate state Saturday. He said her 
3-year-old daughter had nightmares Friday night because she "wonders what 
happened to her baby brother." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson will probably have to stop breast-feeding the baby, Gilbert said, 
because arrangements would be difficult and she feels that the Calverts do not 
want her to bring breast milk for the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Although Johnson is "very comfortable with the decision she made" Friday, she 
would prefer to have the baby living with her, and she still wants a court to 
declare her a legal parent and affirm what she believes is her right to 
participate in raising the baby, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calvert, meanwhile, said his wife was so overjoyed she "won't put the baby 
down. He's constantly in her arms." 
</P>
<P>
After the court hearing Friday, the couple stopped and bought diapers and a 
baby bottle on the way home. Crispina Calvert said she dashed out Saturday 
morning and, in a half-hour shopping spree, bought a white changing table, a 
baby monitor, an infant bathing tub and a few tiny T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is trying not to think about what might happen next in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just thinking about my baby and watching his beautiful face," she said. 
</P>
<P>

FEINSTEIN'S DELIBERATIVE STYLE TEMPERS DECISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The environmental movement swelled larger by the hour this spring as Earth Day 
approached. Politicians, scrambling for support, lined up behind the so-called 
"Big Green" initiative, closely identified with Democrat John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein, Van de Kamp's opponent in the primary, found herself in a 
tight spot. On the subject of the state's most sweeping environmental 
initiative, where was Feinstein? Day after day came the same, standard answer: 
She was studying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Not until Earth Day dawned did she announce her support for the November ballot 
measure, which she now embraces as if it had been hers from the beginning. She 
routinely uses it as a weapon against her Republican opponent in the governor's 
race, Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's advisers find the turn of events an illustration of the candidate's 
decision-making and of the impact of the eclectic set of advisers she relies on 
in her quest to become governor. 
</P>
<P>
The hallmarks, they say, are her near-obsession with detail, with finding 
answers to searching questions about the issue at hand, even if that means 
appearing to publicly dawdle. After the deliberative process is finally 
concluded, the result is set loose with all the dramatic flair she can command. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Feinstein's oft-spoken desire to act as a mediator to solve 
California's pressing problems and the image she tries to project as someone 
who can unify this disparate state, she and her advisers say her process of 
decision-making can be an intellectual brawl. Her style is more a reflection of 
the no-holds-barred world of San Francisco politics in which she matured than a 
mirror of the calm, elegant candidate voters see on their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein says she likes nothing better than getting together a group of 
advisers, preferably strong-minded ones, and hammering out a solution to the 
crisis at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Asking questions and getting a response -- and arguing the response -- is the 
way I think best," Feinstein said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get rid of doubts. You can take thoughts, expose them to the light of 
scrutiny, have people feel free to come back at you. There's no way, no matter 
how much you think you know about something, that you can know all of the 
angles." 
</P>
<P>
But she alone decides. "Decision-making is basically lonely," she said. "You 
make the decision -- because you've got to stand by the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone views that as an advantage. John Barbagelata, a conservative 
Republican and a foe of Feinstein since 1969 when they both successfully ran 
for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, criticizes her as unwilling to 
entertain options other than the one that would benefit her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very headstrong. She runs the show. I don't think anyone can tell her 
anything," said Barbagelata, who left office in 1978. He recalled asking 
Feinstein to put on the ballot a multimillion-dollar sewer system improvement 
that she supported. Feinstein, he said, refused. 
</P>
<P>
"She will not go to the voters with issues," he said, attributing that decision 
to a reluctance to listen to others. 
</P>
<P>
The deliberateness that Feinstein and her allies say is at the core of her 
decision-making is shared by her opponent Wilson. In both cases, it may be 
borne of their municipal beginnings: Each governed a city with the political 
imperatives of coalition and consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, as San Francisco mayor and as candidate for governor, relies on a 
core of regular advisers that is supplemented issue by issue with experts whose 
relationship with her can go back decades or weeks. Apart from family members, 
there is no stereotyping Feinstein's advisers. They are young and old, male and 
female and they represent different races. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regular advisers, there are essentially two overlapping spheres of 
influence -- one made up of loyal holdovers from her decade at the helm of San 
Francisco, the other of political professionals assembled for this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The symbol of San Francisco's influence is Hadley Roff, Feinstein's campaign 
chief of staff, who met the candidate at Stanford University more than three 
decades ago. Their political alliance began when Feinstein, in mid-1979, asked 
Roff to become one of two deputy mayors. 
</P>
<P>
Her other deputy mayor, Rudy Nothenberg, also remains a Feinstein adviser. Now 
San Francisco's chief administrative officer, Nothenberg advises primarily on 
fiscal issues. Among others from San Francisco is Feinstein's adviser on her 
pet issue of growth management, Michael McGill, who served briefly in her 
Administration and has informally worked with Feinstein for years. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime family friend Henry Berman, the campaign's treasurer, and Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) routinely advise Feinstein, as does Rev. 
Cecil Williams, who runs Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San 
Francisco's Tenderloin area. Nancy Pelosi, formerly Feinstein's neighbor and 
currently the Democratic congresswoman from San Francisco, is another informal 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
In the heat of the campaign, Feinstein relies strongly on the relatively new 
group assembled for the race -- Bill Carrick, the campaign director; his 
partner and media consultant, Hank Morris; press secretary Dee Dee Myers; 
political director Percy Pinkney and issues director Vicky Rideout. 
</P>
<P>
For her supplemental core of advisers, Feinstein has borrowed liberally from 
the ranks of Democratic legislative experts. Steve Thompson, head of the 
Assembly Office of Research and a close ally of Speaker Brown, was Feinstein's 
chief issues adviser during the primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Battson, an aide to Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), helps on 
water policy, and Lucien Wulsin, an aide to Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los 
Angeles) advises on health issues. Barry Groveman, a former Los Angeles deputy 
district attorney and a co-author of Proposition 65, the 1986 anti-toxics 
initiative, is Feinstein's prime environmental adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Her advisers do not speak with one voice. Williams and Pelosi, for example, 
disagree with Feinstein on the major issue of capital punishment, which she 
favors and they oppose. Aides suggest that trustworthiness, rather than 
ideological point of view, is most important to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"She disdains sycophants," said Roff, her chief of staff, who said she prefers 
"people who know their own mind." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein says she has never had a formalized "kitchen cabinet," a group of 
ambitious peers such as accompanied a former California governor, Ronald 
Reagan, from Sacramento to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It just never worked for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign director Carrick, for one, attributes the absence of such a group to 
Feinstein's gender. When she initially ran for a seat on the San Francisco 
Board of Supervisors, Feinstein was swimming against the prevailing political 
tide, Carrick said. Influential politicians tried to talk her out of her plans 
on the grounds that there already was a woman on the board. She ran anyway and 
won more votes than any other candidate. Later, she ran unsuccessfully for 
mayor before assuming the office after the shooting death of Mayor George 
Moscone. 
</P>
<P>
"(Her) whole history is a different sort of history than people who plot their 
political career by the hour," Carrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Feinstein comes to having a kitchen cabinet is the support she 
receives from her family. Her father and uncle, Leon and Morrie Goldman, were 
her first political influences. Her husband, Richard C. Blum, now serves as 
what Feinstein calls a "general" in the expensive effort to get her elected. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's campaign, and Van de Kamp's before it, have tried to portray Blum as a 
mysterious marionette who controls Feinstein's views and moves. Blum and other 
advisers say that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
"She and I are sort of like any other couple," said Blum, who married Feinstein 
in 1980. "I give her my advice and sometimes she listens and sometimes she 
doesn't. It's sort of a normal, healthy marriage. We're like other human 
beings. We don't see eye to eye." 
</P>
<P>
Blum says, and others agree, that he and Feinstein think alike on most issues. 
In their differences -- which he will not discuss openly -- Blum is said to 
lean toward more progressive positions than Feinstein naturally takes. 
</P>
<P>
Other Feinstein advisers believe that Blum has been influential in bringing in 
experts to help Feinstein, among them a host of volunteer financial advisers 
who helped the city cope with the drastic effects of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
No one suggests that Blum carries the day with any regularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Blum gives his opinion, but he does not by any means win the battle all 
the time," said Williams, a friend of the couple as well as an adviser. "I've 
heard him say, 'That's all I can say. Dianne's made up her mind.' He knows and 
all of us know that when she makes up her mind, she's determined." 
</P>
<P>
The other family member of influence is Feinstein's only child, Katherine, 33, 
a labor lawyer whose presence on the campaign trail is more regular than 
Blum's. Aides say she has not only provided a source of companionship during 
campaign trips but also has been instrumental in crafting Feinstein's 
criminal-justice platform. 
</P>
<P>
Family or outsider, all Feinstein advisers say they are confronted regularly by 
her immense appetite for details. In an interview, Feinstein spoke with pride 
about Monday meetings she held with department heads while mayor of San 
Francisco. There, she said, she could quiz the police chief at length about 
crime statistics, down to particular types of crimes in particular 
neighborhoods, and press for detailed solutions. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on details is notable because Feinstein, particularly during the 
primary, was criticized for being vague. Aides lay the blame on a related 
Feinstein attribute -- a reluctance to address issues unless she feels she has 
a command of the particulars. In the primary, when she was attacking subjects 
that she had not mastered as the mayor of a contained, urban city, Feinstein 
was on the defensive, advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
"Dianne doesn't like to wing anything," said her husband, Blum. "She would just 
rather not talk about a subject if she's not prepared for it. . . . There were 
a bunch of issues eight or nine months ago -- where she hadn't formed her own 
policy -- that a mayor doesn't work on." 
</P>
<P>
In a political season, candidates daily are called to answer on specific 
policies. Feinstein's reluctance to take a position was most obvious before 
Earth Day last April. Although she ultimately did come out in favor of "Big 
Green," Feinstein took political hits almost daily during the period she was 
studying the matter. 
</P>
<P>
That and other incidents during the primary helped foster an image of Feinstein 
as either unwilling to commit herself or unfamiliar with issues -- troublesome 
political negatives that her own campaign director acknowledges were rooted in 
Feinstein's approach. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted her questions answered about her concerns about what it would do or 
what it wouldn't do, whether it was realistic, whether it was pragmatic," said 
Carrick. "She asked a lot of questions about its impact on the agricultural 
industry -- whereas the easy political thing to do would have been to write 
that off and move on." 
</P>
<P>
"Deliberateness and campaigns don't generally have a lot of compatibility, " 
Carrick added. "So, sure, it's a frustration, and it gets us into trouble from 
time to time." 
</P>
<P>
Aides say that once Feinstein is comfortable with details of a particular 
issue, her confidence rises and she can command an almost instant recall. 
</P>
<P>
McGill, an aide to Feinstein while she was mayor, described a virtual 
transformation he said took place when Feinstein approached a problem in San 
Francisco. Regularly, he said, she would alert staff members to an event that 
was about three weeks away and would give them an initial reading of her 
thinking. The staff would set to work fleshing out ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"The first week, she'd be a little snappish and say, 'I can't spend much time 
on that' (because of more pressing business)," said McGill, now Feinstein's 
adviser on growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The second week, she had already absorbed things we thought she was not 
listening to. As the event approached, she would start absorbing with amazing 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of three weeks, she would stand there and give a recitation like 
she had been an expert on the issue for a year." 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Feinstein reads voraciously from issue books compiled by 
her staff. In the books are memos by the candidate and her advisers that show 
her evolving thoughts and her staff's assessment of the options. 
</P>
<P>
Tellingly, during an interview about her advisers, Feinstein took pains to 
praise two of them, though neither for intellectual prowess nor political 
savvy. One was praised for an ability to write concise and understandable 
memos, the other for perfecting a style of memo-writing that Feinstein found 
particularly appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein and her advisers tried to build in the sort of deliberate preparation 
that does not come naturally in a campaign. McGill's efforts on growth 
management, for example, began with a call from Feinstein last fall. The first 
draft of a plan was delivered in January, with successive drafts crafted in the 
following months. The plan has yet to be publicly announced, but Feinstein has 
written letters to environmental leaders offering some details. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time she sought out McGill, Feinstein also asked Los Angeles 
attorney Barry Groveman to handle environmental issues. After a few meetings, 
he forwarded an outline, parts of which have been released publicly in various 
forums. Behind the scenes, Feinstein has also courted environmentalists in 
private get-acquainted sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Aides and Feinstein say that not all of Feinstein's grasp of issues comes from 
memos. In San Francisco, she commonly trekked into the city streets to get a 
handle on visible problems, from drug use to potholes. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has accompanied Feinstein on countless visits to the poor and 
homeless in San Francisco, predicts that she will lean on aides to provide the 
same hands-on experience across the state if she is elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with the experts (to advise her), she's still going to put her feet on 
the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FEINSTEIN'S TOP AIDES 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne Feinstein's campaign team is reflective of the larger group of advisers 
she depends on: They are a mix of newcomers and longtime loyalists, men and 
women, Anglos and minorities. Of the senior staff, one has known Feinstein 
since their days together at Stanford University more than 30 years ago; 
another jumped aboard the campaign just this summer. Here are the senior staff 
members: 
</P>
<P>
BILL CARRICK, 40, an Aiken, S.C., native whose accent betrays his roots, is the 
director of the Democratic effort, having taken over with his partner Hank 
Morris after Feinstein's original campaign manager, Clint Reilly, quit in a 
well-publicized huff. Carrick is well-versed in Democratic heavyweights -- he 
formerly served as political director for Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. 
He also was national campaign director of Rep. Richard A. Gephardt's 
unsuccessful run for the presidency in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
HANK MORRIS, 37, carries the title of media strategist and consultant, and as 
such has been credited with the single defining item of Feinstein's campaign 
thus far, the gripping television commercial that vaulted her past Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp to victory in the primary. Morris joined the campaign with 
Carrick in November, 1989, and still operates largely out of his New York 
office. He previously has worked for former governors Hugh Carey of New York 
and John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
HADLEY ROFF, 58, comes as close as anyone outside of Feinstein's family to 
being a longtime confidante of the former San Francisco mayor. They met at 
Stanford University, and Roff was working at City Hall when Feinstein first 
gained a seat on the Board of Supervisors. In July, 1979, seven months after 
she became mayor, Feinstein picked Roff as one of two deputy mayors, a position 
he continued to hold after she left office in 1988. He began working for 
Feinstein again in February, 1989, when her candidacy for governor had been 
largely dismissed. He serves as chief of staff, working in the campaign's San 
Francisco headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
DEE DEE MYERS, 29, is a holdover from the original Feinstein campaign 
organization. She joined as press secretary in May, 1989, before original 
campaign director Reilly quit. At Feinstein's side at almost every appearance 
she makes, and Feinstein's most constant defender to reporters, Myers is 
somewhat of a campaign junkie. She served as press secretary for Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley and worked on his 1986 gubernatorial campaign. She also 
worked as California press secretary for 1988 Democratic nominee Michael S. 
Dukakis and in Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
DUANE GARRETT, 43, is a San Francisco lawyer who signed up along with Roff in 
February, 1989, and serves as the campaign chairman, the titular head. Leaving 
most of the strategic workings to Carrick and Morris, Garrett most recently has 
concentrated on the most pressing concern of the Feinstein campaign, raising 
enough money to combat Sen. Pete Wilson. Garrett served in the same role for 
Bradley's 1982 run for governor. In 1984, he was the national co-chairman of 
the Democratic presidential effort of former Vice President Mondale, and held a 
similar post four years later for former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN PLAXCO, 39, is concentrating this political season on raising the mother's 
milk of campaigns -- money. The Louisiana native works with Garrett and 
Feinstein's husband, Richard C. Blum, in raising the millions of dollars she 
will need to have a chance against the well-financed Wilson effort. Plaxco, 
rarely present at public events, has been for a year the campaign's state 
finance director, a job he held in the campaign of state Controller Gray Davis. 
In the last election cycle, that of 1988, Plaxco was the California campaign 
manager for the presidential bid of Illinois Sen. Paul Simon. 
</P>
<P>
VICKY RIDEOUT, 33, has accomplished the move that bystanders can find 
mystifying and that political veterans learn to expect. Three months ago, she 
was deputy campaign manager for Democratic candidate Van de Kamp, issuing 
blistering reports on alleged failings of Feinstein. With his campaign over in 
June, she came aboard the Feinstein effort the next month as issues director. 
She has earned praise from the candidate and other advisers for concise and 
understandable memorandums on various issues debated during the campaign. 
Rideout previously served as senior domestic political adviser for the 1988 
Dukakis campaign. 
</P>
<P>
PERCY PINKNEY, 48, began working for Feinstein last January as political 
director, a job in which he links Feinstein with various political entities 
across the state. Previously, he did the same job for Los Angeles City 
Councilman Robert Farrell in his bid for the Assembly, and for Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. when he ran for governor. Pinkney rides somewhat of a thin 
line these days: Feinstein has spent much time disdaining organized political 
groups, yet finds herself now needing any organized help she can get.

GOVERNOR SIGNS OFFSHORE SPILL CLEANUP PLAN 
</P>

<P>
Saying "an ounce of prevention would certainly be worth a barrel of spilled 
crude oil," Gov. George Deukmejian on Saturday signed into law the most 
comprehensive offshore oil spill prevention and cleanup plan in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In his regular weekly radio address, the governor said the new law "will give 
California an unprecedented ability to prevent spills before they happen and to 
fight the effects of spills if they do occur." 
</P>
<P>
The statute, which takes effect immediately, is a direct result of the Exxon 
Valdez oil spill in Alaska last year and the British Petroleum tanker spill off 
Huntington Beach in February. 
</P>
<P>
Generally viewed as one of the major achievements of the recently concluded 
legislative session, it would create a $100-million oil spill cleanup fund to 
be financed by placing an additional tax of 25 cents on each barrel of oil, 
which is expected to add less than a cent per gallon of gasoline sold at the 
pump. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a spill, the state also would be given unlimited authority to 
borrow additional funds for cleanup operations that would be repaid by the oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The governor is given the power to appoint a state oil spill "czar" or response 
administrator who will be charged with setting up a detailed comprehensive plan 
for the safe transportation of oil along California's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
These steps are expected to include surprise inspections of tankers and 
terminals, up-to-date safety plans for refineries, use of radar for tanker 
traffic, and requiring tugboat escorts in hazardous waters. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies transporting their product through state waters also must be able 
to demonstrate that they have $500 million worth of oil spill liability 
insurance protection. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 60 days after a spill, cleanup crews will be immune from lawsuits 
for property damage they may cause. Oil industry representatives contend that 
immunity from liability for professional cleanup crews is necessary because 
they must act quickly to prevent the spill from spreading and should not be 
inhibited by fears that they might get sued. 
</P>
<P>
The new law is a compromise worked out during nine months of intensive 
high-stakes negotiations involving a multitude of interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
They included the Administration, Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) and Assemblyman 
Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), sponsors of two rival oil spill prevention and 
cleanup measures, the oil companies, trial lawyers and environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian threatened to veto the Keene bill sent to his desk unless the oil 
spill fund was capped at $50 million and the "czar" appointment was not subject 
to Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, who demanded that the fund total $150 million, kept the 
confirmation requirement in the final version of the bill. It passed the Senate 
by a 30-1 vote and the Assembly by a 70-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
In his radio speech, Deukmejian said: "As everyone knows, the price of an oil 
spill is measured not only in miles of polluted beaches, but also in the tax 
dollars that must be expended to clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always said that in any oil spill plan, the oil industry must be 
financially accountable for the costs that result from these spills. 
</P>
<P>
"New civil and criminal penalties will be put on the books, and responsible 
parties will be made absolutely liable for damages caused by their spills." 
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the value of oil spill prevention work that will be 
stimulated by the new law. 
</P>
<P>
"Cleanup efforts, no matter how well carried out," he said, "pale in 
effectiveness compared to solid prevention activities. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of oil spills, an ounce of prevention would certainly be worth a 
barrel of spilled crude oil." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the governor underlined that California will remain heavily 
dependent on oil shipped to the state in tankers to help fuel the expanding 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
But the new oil spill prevention and cleanup law "will allow us to maintain 
that important balance between economic growth and environmental balance . . . 
to ensure that our quality of life will remain the envy of the world," 
Deukmejian said.

MAINTAIN HIGH INTEREST RATES, GROUP OF 7 SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Top economic officials from the seven major industrialized democracies agreed 
Saturday that they must maintain high interest rates to keep the oil price 
shock caused by the Persian Gulf conflict from producing an inflationary price 
spiral. 
</P>
<P>
But a statement by finance ministers and central bankers, issued after a 
seven-hour private meeting at Blair House across from the White House, left 
wiggle room for the Bush Administration to urge lower U.S. rates if Congress 
and the White House ever reach agreement on a plan to shrink the gaping federal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"The rise in the price of oil associated with the gulf crisis poses two risks: 
a risk of inflation and a risk of lower economic growth," the Group of Seven 
communique said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ministers and governors consider that stability-oriented monetary policies 
and sound fiscal policies constitute the correct policy response," the 
statement continued. "Such a response should help guard against the underlying 
inflation rate being affected by higher oil prices and thus reduce the risks of 
lower economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and most economic officials abroad want 
to keep a tight rein on credit to fight inflation, even if it means running a 
greater risk of an economic downturn in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Their goal is to avoid repeating the policy mistakes of the 1970s, when the 
United States and several other countries initially tried to cushion the blow 
of higher oil prices with easy money, only to be forced later to endure severe 
recessions in 1974-75 and in 1982 as they sought to wring double-digit 
inflation out of the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, worried about sagging U.S. economic 
growth, has been seeking lower U.S. interest rates to stave off a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to settle the dispute, the G-7 officials did their best to paper over 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, in a briefing for reporters after the meeting, said the statement 
focused equally on the dangers of both increased inflation and slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no intention to say one risk was greater than the other," Brady 
said. The goal, he insisted, should be to seek stable economic policies that 
try to "steer between the two risks." 
</P>
<P>
But most other participants hammered away at the anti-inflation message in the 
communique. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson told reporters after the meeting that 
the group agreed that controlling inflation now would avert greater problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get on top of inflationary pressures now, the difficulties will be 
far more severe in the future," Wilson warned. 
</P>
<P>
And Karl Otto Poehl, president of West Germany's central bank, also said he 
expects most countries to continue to fight inflation with higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Countries already have high interest rates," Poehl said before the meeting 
started, "and I think that's the right way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The G-7, meeting in advance of this week's annual meeting of the 152-nation 
International Monetary Fund and its sister lending organization, the World 
Bank, includes finance ministers and central bankers from the United States, 
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Despite growing worries over the shaky global economic outlook, the economic 
officials also sought to reassure world markets that they can ride out the 
current oil price shock without suffering a worldwide recession. 
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding oil price developments, solid growth is being experienced in 
their economies this year, particularly in continental Europe and Japan," the 
statement noted. "The G-7 expansion is expected to continue next year, the 
ninth consecutive year of sustained growth." 
</P>
<P>
The officials argued that major industrial nations are in a better position to 
withstand an oil price shock today because of sharp improvements in energy 
efficiency since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years, when most of the focus of the G-7 meetings was on the 
need to narrow the U.S. trade deficit through a lower dollar without causing a 
panic in world currency markets, there was only a mild reference to currency 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
The policy-makers endorsed recent changes in exchange markets, where the 
Japanese yen has strengthened while the dollar has weakened. 
</P>
<P>
A lower dollar can help reduce the U.S. trade deficit by making American goods 
cheaper to foreign buyers, but it also fuels inflation here by adding to the 
cost of imports and making it easier for American manufacturers to raise their 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's minister of finance, said he told the G-7 officials 
that Tokyo welcomes "the fact that recently, the yen has been moving firmly 
against the U.S. dollar and European currencies. We could accept the 
continuation of this trend. But we must by all means avoid the nose-diving of 
the U.S. dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Japan, despite its heavy dependence on imported oil, will continue to grow, 
Hashimoto said, and does not need to slam on its monetary-policy brakes to keep 
inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
The G-7 also lent strong support to the U.S.-led effort to "provide immediate 
and medium-term economic assistance to the front-line states" of Jordan, Egypt 
and Turkey in the potential military conflict with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The officials urged the lending agencies to relax their normal insistence on 
austerity measures in the borrowing countries. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are fearful that the economic embargo of Iraq could begin to 
crack unless aid is funneled quickly to the countries coping with a flood of 
refugees and with the loss of export markets. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said the policy-makers did not discuss a specific dollar amount for the 
aid, but Theo Waigel, West Germany's finance minister, told reporters that the 
United States is seeking $14 billion for the front-line states. The IMF and 
World Bank are trying to develop a $9-billion package for other countries 
severely hurt by higher oil prices.

TEST PILOTS GET WALK OF HONOR IN LANCASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone in the aeronautics community knew they had the right stuff, and now 
the city of Lancaster has made it official. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Yeager, Jimmy Doolittle, A. Scott Crossfield, Tony LeVier and Pete Knight 
-- pilots who achieved dizzying heights in the early days of flight testing -- 
became the first Saturday to be honored in Lancaster's Aerospace Walk of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sure a different breed of cat from the rest of us," said George Root, 
vice mayor of Lancaster. "They're internationally known for taking phenomenal 
risks in one-of-a-kind aircraft to learn the planes' limits, and some of them 
did it right here." 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after the Hollywood Walk of Fame and celebrity walks elsewhere, the 
sidewalk monument display had been shrouded in secrecy for months. Saturday 
morning, before the pilots' names were announced at a $50-per-plate dinner that 
evening, the five granite monuments were installed on Lancaster Boulevard, 
boxed in black crates and guarded by volunteers from the Civil Air Patrol. Each 
6-foot-tall, 675-pound monument bears a decorative, brushed aluminum medallion 
and name of the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept it secret because we wanted to build excitement in the community, very 
much like the Academy Awards," said Nancy Walker, a spokeswoman for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Yeager, the legendary combat and test pilot immortalized in Tom Wolfe's book 
"The Right Stuff" about the chutzpah of the fliers, said in an interview last 
week that test pilots and movie stars are worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hell of a comparison -- Hollywood movie stars and us," Yeager, 67, 
said. "The test pilot lives a real life, not a fantasy. Basically, you have to 
remember duty enters into it -- that's paramount." 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, Yeager was the first pilot in the world to break the sound barrier, 
even though he had two broken ribs at the time. Knight, 61, set the world's 
speed record in 1967 by flying the X-15 at Mach 6, or 4,520 m.p.h., twice as 
fast as a .50-caliber bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the pilots, LeVier, 77, and Crossfield, 68, were civilians who helped 
design and test high-powered aircraft. Doolittle, 93, is a retired Air Force 
lieutenant general who made the first successful "blind" or instruments-only 
flight in 1929. He is also renowned for voluntarily leading a raid by 16 B-25 
bombers against Tokyo on April 18, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
More monuments will be added to the Walk each year.

A Canadian man was being held on drug charges Saturday after officials seized a 
cargo plane that apparently ran low on fuel before landing with more than 1,300 
kilograms of cocaine, worth an estimated $130 million, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police searched the residential neighborhood surrounding the 
Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton Airport for two other men who fled the DC-3 after it 
landed shortly before midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Hill, 46, was arraigned Saturday and was being held in Lehigh County 
Jail on $10-million bail, according to Lehigh County Dist. Atty. William Platt. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Hill was arrested by state police after the plane landed to 
refuel. 
</P>
<P>
Platt said the pilot turned off the plane's lights as it approached the 
airport. The pilot turned on the lights just before landing near the airport 
fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane came in without radio clearance, lights or a transponder going, and 
the tower alerted the airport police," Platt said. "It was not spotted on 
radar. . . . It was not spotted until it was visually sighted by the tower." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the three men on board the plane were met by an airport security 
guard and an airport firefighter. The men fled on foot and were chased by the 
two airport employees, who were joined by state police. 
</P>
<P>
"When the police approached them, they said they landed because they needed 
fuel and they thought the tower was closed," Platt said. "They said they were 
going to a phone . . . and they ran." 
</P>
<P>
Hill was apprehended near the airport and was charged with possession of 
cocaine with intent to deliver and conspiracy. The other two suspects, 
identified as pilot William McGoldrich and a man known only as "Rick," escaped. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo area of the aging propeller-driven plane was about three-quarters 
full of 28 military-style duffel bags stuffed with 1-kilogram bricks of nearly 
pure cocaine, Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (officers) thought, based on the quantity, that it must be marijuana," 
Platt said. "When they found it was cocaine, they were shocked." 
</P>
<P>
No weapons were found with the 1,349 kilograms -- 2,967 pounds -- of cocaine, 
Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
Platt said police believe the flight originated in Colombia and was on its way 
to Canada, possibly making drops along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"There were marks on some of the containers that led us to believe some of the 
drugs were destined for New York and Canada," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing on the charges was scheduled for Friday. If convicted, 
Hill faces up to 10 years in jail, Platt said.

CRIME: TENANTS ARE IRRITATED BY ABANDONED TRUNKS. ONE PIECE OF LUGGAGE IS EVEN

<P>
The two large black steamer trunks stood blocking part of the second-floor 
hallway of the five-story apartment building on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 
</P>
<P>
As days passed, tenants regarded them as a nuisance. One even kicked the 
luggage in anger. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, that was not a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
When the luggage was opened late Friday, police found 20 automatic weapons, 2 
shotguns, 17 silencers, 3 walkie-talkies, 3 large bags of ammunition, assorted 
explosives, 4 electronic devices, a bullet proof vest, detonators and scales. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb squad ordered the building evacuated, and police told its 
superintendent, George Nunes, 35, that if the explosives had gone off, the 
32-apartment structure would have been leveled. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, FBI agents wearing white surgical gloves dusted the apartment 
believed to be the one the trunks came from, and authorities wondered if they 
had stumbled across the tracks of international terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the apartment's regular tenant had rented the dwelling last 
February to a woman described as 18 to 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"When the person failed to pay the rent, the resident moved back in and moved 
the steamer trunks," a police spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the regular tenant eventually got around to having the trunks 
opened, and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency squad personnel cleared most of one block of East 75th Street and, 
wary of setting off explosives, warned residents of the building not to switch 
television channels, not to turn on any appliances and not to use the elevator 
as they were evacuated, Nunes said. 
</P>
<P>
He said several weeks ago, three men came to the apartment house searching for 
the subtenant. One of the men showed a detective's badge. When the woman was 
not found, the men departed and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the lobby on Saturday, the building's superintendent described the 
woman who had rented the apartment from the regular tenant as a dark-haired 
"youthful" white woman with hazel eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Nunes said she spoke with a British accent. "She was polite," he said, but he 
could not give any further information. 
</P>
<P>
Shaken residents of the building said they were ordered out of their homes by 
police at 8:30 p.m. Friday and were not allowed back into their apartments 
until about 1:20 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
One apartment dweller on the second floor, who declined to give her name, said 
a neighbor had become so annoyed by the presence of the big black steamer 
trunks in the hallway that he had begun to kick the luggage. 
</P>
<P>
"We all got sick at looking at them," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter who knocked on the door of apartment 2-F in the building found FBI 
agents wearing surgical gloves dusting for fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
The explosives were taken to the police firing range to be detonated. The 
weapons were given to a joint FBI-police anti-terrorist task force to be 
checked for fingerprints and to determine if any serial numbers could be 
traced. 
</P>
<P>
The police spokeswoman said the anti-terrorist task force was in charge of the 
investigation.

The NAACP said in a statement released Saturday that it would oppose the 
nomination of David H. Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The 500,000-member National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People said 
that Souter's recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee failed to 
clear up concerns about his position on affirmative action and other civil 
rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has wrapped up five days of hearings on Souter and is expected to 
vote on the nomination this week.

DESPITE ARAB JITTERS, BAKER CONTINUES TO INSIST ON A SECURITY STRUCTURE FOR 
PERSIAN GULF REGION; 
</P>
<P>
GEOPOLITICS: NO MATTER HOW THE CRISIS ENDS, HE CONTENDS, IRAQ MUST BE PREVENTED 
FROM RENEWING ITS AGGRESSION.

<P>
When Secretary of State James A. Baker III proposed a NATO-style security 
structure that would extend the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf 
beyond the end of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, he hoped to reassure American allies 
and worry Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the idea produced far more anxiety in Saudi Arabia and the 
other gulf states than it did in Iraq. Baker quickly backtracked from the NATO 
analogy and admitted that he was really just thinking aloud in his comments to 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in almost three weeks since his Sept. 4 appearance on Capitol 
Hill, Baker has repeated, refined and reinforced his basic premise: No matter 
how the current crisis ends, new security measures must be adopted in the gulf 
to prevent Iraq from renewing its aggression, especially if the Baghdad regime 
gets out of the confrontation with its army intact. 
</P>
<P>
Stated that way, few could object to the premise. But no one in the 
Administration seems to know how the objective can be accomplished. And the 
idea of a single security structure -- no matter how it might be shaped -- has 
been virtually abandoned as unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Administration officials now are talking about a wide range of 
measures, such as a long-term embargo on the sale to Iraq of military 
technology and a massive redistribution of wealth from oil-rich sheiks to their 
dirt-poor neighbors to rob future demagogues of the economic resentment that 
Hussein has tried so hard to exploit. Some officials even talk about a renewed 
effort to cure the Middle East's "core problems," particularly the 
Israeli-Palestinian dispute. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is reminiscent of the sort of utopian "after-the-war" thinking that 
has produced disillusionment in the past. Officials talk about the 
opportunities presented by the gulf crisis, forgetting that the region's most 
difficult problems have very little to do with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
They have realized, however, that the region's problems do not lend themselves 
well to the concept of a single security structure. "I just don't think it will 
be one organization," a senior State Department official said. "We don't have 
in mind any single security structure. European models don't apply." 
</P>
<P>
One reason there can be no single organization, he acknowledged, is that no one 
has been able to determine a role for Israel. Arab-Israeli hostility would seem 
to preclude the inclusion of the Jewish state in a predominantly Arab 
organization, but a Middle East security structure that does not include the 
region's most potent military force is equally inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
The current centerpiece of American post-crisis planning is economic rather 
than military. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the exiled government 
of Kuwait have agreed to provide $6 billion in aid to countries that have been 
hard hit by the embargo against Iraq, in addition to about $6 billion to defray 
the cost of U.S. military operations. 
</P>
<P>
If the rich gulf states can be persuaded to continue their wartime generosity, 
the official said, they could reduce the economic disparities of the region and 
deprive Hussein of one of his most appealing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to demonstrate that (Hussein's) way won't work," the official 
said. "We have to show that other ways work better." 
</P>
<P>
When Baker first raised the issue, however, the focus was on ways to contain 
Iraq in the event that the crisis ends peacefully, leaving Hussein with a 
massive army, a frightening arsenal of chemical weapons and an emerging nuclear 
arms industry. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed, Baker said, is a long-term structure -- with American 
participation -- that could frustrate Hussein's ambitions. Although he did not 
exactly call his plan a NATO for the gulf, he drew an unmistakable comparison. 
When a lawmaker suggested that no regional organization could deal with a 
nuclear-armed Iraq, Baker said, "It worked in Europe. The Soviet Union had 
nuclear weapons going back to Stalin's time." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, in an appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
Baker thought better of the NATO analogy. He said it would be impossible to 
transplant the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Later that week, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd bluntly told Baker that his kingdom 
would have nothing to do with a formal organization like NATO. And the king 
made it clear that he wanted American ground troops to go home as soon as the 
crisis ends. 
</P>
<P>
"What he (Baker) has is a good idea, but the way he said it and the forum in 
which he said it set off a lot of alarm bells," a State Department official 
said. He added that the plan was devised by Baker and a few top advisers 
instead of coming up through the State Department bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
In his original presentation, Baker said the United States should maintain a 
military presence in the post-crisis gulf. He later suggested that the Soviet 
Union could play a similar role. 
</P>
<P>
After the Saudis made it clear that they do not want a permanent contingent of 
American troops, Baker and other U.S. officials said it would be enough for the 
United States to maintain a naval presence in the gulf, as it has done since 
1947. For the time being, officials said, the naval armada would be far more 
extensive than it has been for most of the past 43 years. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official said Washington could safely withdraw all of 
its ground forces because "we have already demonstrated that we can get them 
there pretty fast." He said the U.S. ability to deploy quickly to the gulf 
would be almost as much of a deterrent to Iraq as a garrison of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Kemp, a former National Security Council expert on the Middle East, 
said the key question is how visible the U.S. forces would be. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a need for some long-term commitment for rapid redeployment and 
possibly some permanent stationing of air elements," said Kemp, now a scholar 
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "A permanent 
American ground presence would be highly controversial and probably 
counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the shape of the post-crisis world will be determined in large 
measure by the way in which the confrontation plays itself out. Consequences of 
war would be far different from those of a peaceful solution. Nevertheless, 
some advance planning is clearly needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a nation of chess players," said George Carver, a former deputy 
director of the CIA. "(President) Bush made exactly the right moves to Saddam's 
opening gambit. But you have to think about your board position five or six 
moves in advance. And you have to give some thought to the end game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we ought to take advantage of the mood of alliance and cooperation, 
which will have a very short half-life, to address some of the Middle East's 
festering sores, notably the Palestinian problem and Lebanon," Carver said. 
</P>
<P>
Other experts, both in and out of the Administration, called for renewed 
efforts to settle the Arab-Israeli dispute as soon as the gulf crisis ends, 
even though the two issues seem to have very little in common beyond simple 
geography. A senior State Department official said a renewed effort to 
jump-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is high on the 
Administration's post-crisis priority list. 
</P>
<P>
William B. Quandt, a former National Security Council expert on the Middle 
East, said the Administration should try to take advantage of Syria's presence 
in the U.S.-led multinational military force to urge negotiations between 
Israel and President Hafez Assad's regime. 
</P>
<P>
"In the post-crisis period, it will be worth concentrating more on the 
Syrian-Israeli front and putting the Israeli-Palestinian dispute on the back 
burner," said Quandt, now a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
"There might be a chance of getting (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir's 
government into negotiations with the Syrians. That would be a lot easier than 
getting them to talk about something for the West Bank." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Israel has said it is ready to negotiate with any Arab nation, but 
it has been reluctant to enter a dialogue with Palestinian representatives.

Pick the correct date for fighting in the Persian Gulf to break out and you 
could win big money -- if you're one of the American business people in Saudi 
Arabia trying to relieve tensions by holding war lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
The buildup of U.S.-led forces in the gulf has fueled speculation that a clash 
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
The lotteries developed because almost every conversation wends its way to that 
topic. 
</P>
<P>
In one such game, players put up nearly $200 to choose a calendar day when 
fighting might erupt. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy favorites so far are concentrated in mid- to late October. Bets for 
November are not yet being accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Players tend to avoid choosing Fridays and Sundays, the Muslim and Christian 
holy days. Many have chosen Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
One group has formed what it calls an Actual Hostilities Committee to determine 
what level of clash is sufficient to qualify for the prize. 
</P>
<P>
This particular group takes into account the possibility of a diplomatic 
solution.

HANOI AGREES TO REPATRIATION OF 'BOAT PEOPLE'

Britain, Vietnam and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have 
reached an agreement that could lead to the repatriation of thousands of 
Vietnamese "boat people" from overcrowded camps in Hong Kong, officials in 
Hanoi said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The joint statement, released in London, said that Vietnam had agreed after two 
days of talks to take back refugees who have not volunteered for repatriation 
but are not opposed to returning. 
</P>
<P>
There was international condemnation after 51 Vietnamese, categorized by 
Britain as non-refugees, were forcibly sent home from Hong Kong in December, 
1989. The wording of Saturday's statement was careful not to suggest any forced 
repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.N. office, rather than the Hong Kong government as in 
the past, would be responsible for coaxing the 50,000 boat people to leave 
camps in Hong Kong and return home. Most do not qualify as refugees under 
international criteria and are ineligible for resettlement in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was initiated by Vietnam and represented a turnabout in thinking by 
Hanoi, which in the past has refused to accept any refugees who had not 
volunteered to return home. 
</P>
<P>
The change in policy from Hanoi comes at a time when Vietnam is hoping for a 
European Community aid package and is looking to improve relations with its 
Southeast Asian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are continuing on the matter of those boat people who are refusing 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
British officials described the agreement as a breakthrough, and said they are 
confident they will be able to send back large numbers of refugees without the 
use of force. 
</P>
<P>
David Colvin, head of the British negotiating team, said he hoped the program 
could get under way in a matter of weeks.

Zimbabwe's ruling party decided to drop its campaign to legalize one-party rule 
in the African nation. 
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as a political setback for President Robert Mugabe. The 
central committee of Mugabe's ZANU-PF party argued that the country is a de 
facto one-party state because of the party's hold on Parliament and there is no 
need for legal status. Mugabe contends that a multi-party system breeds tribal 
conflicts, and he had made a one-party law the linchpin of his plans for the 
nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Seven months ago, when most folks here thought a Mapplethorpe more than likely 
was a type of rare songbird, a group of men and women who call themselves 
Citizens for Community Values somehow procured copies of Robert Mapplethorpe 
photographs that were scheduled to be displayed at a downtown arts center. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they agreed, this was smut. 
</P>
<P>
Having reached this decision, though, the group agonized awhile. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothered us a lot," said Phil Burress, spokesman for the organization. "We 
spent a lot of time talking about this -- what should we do." 
</P>
<P>
The late Robert Mapplethorpe, after all, was not your average scuzzy, no-name 
pornographer -- the type the citizens group and others like it have been 
chasing out of Cincinnati a good 20 years. He was a respected artist. His works 
hung in museums. Going after him and Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center, 
which was bringing his photographs to town, would not be quite the same as 
getting stores to stop selling Hustler magazine. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, the group made its decision: "Obscenity is obscenity, no matter 
where it's at," is how group spokesman Burress put it. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that decision, and the events it set into motion, the arts 
center and its director will stand trial this week on two misdemeanor counts 
each of pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-oriented material. It 
is the first time a major museum or gallery has stood trial on an obscenity 
charge, legal scholars say, and the case is being watched closely by art 
professionals and anti-pornography groups across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe died on March 9, 1989. But his sometimes shocking photographs 
depicting graphic sadomasochistic acts and homosexual poses have helped kindle 
a national debate on freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar over his work began last year when the Corcoran Gallery in 
Washington, D.C., cancelled a showing of his photographs because of opposition 
lead by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
By the time that happened, the Contemporary Arts Center already had made 
arrangements to bring the show to this conservative Midwest city. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw the Mapplethorpe show in New York I thought it was an absolutely 
stunning exhibit," said Dennis Barrie, director of the arts center. "It fit 
into our mission, which has been to show challenging work for 51 years." 
</P>
<P>
Barrie, who has been director of the center for six years, said that until the 
Washington controversy began he never dreamed that Mapplethorpe's photographs 
would cause a stir here. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think this was that extraordinary," he said. "Mapplethorpe is not the 
first artist to deal with homosexuality and he's not the first artist to have 
fairly graphic photographs . . . . We and other places in the city have shown 
this kind of work." 
</P>
<P>
"Either he was very ignorant of our community standards," said Burress of 
Barrie, "or he deliberately was trying to challenge us. He's paying the price, 
one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to restrict anybody's artistic ability, if this is what they 
call artistic ability," Burress added. "Take pictures, do what you want, but 
don't put it on public display . . . . This is where the big problem is." 
</P>
<P>
Since the controversy in Washington last year, Mapplethorpe's photographs have 
toured the country, causing little stir in most cities where they have been 
exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
In Cincinnati, the Citizens for Community Values launched a campaign of public 
pressure and letter writing last March. Cincinnati Police Chief Lawrence Whalen 
and Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis, a man whose reputation as a pornography 
fighter goes back for decades, stated publicly that some of the photographs 
were in their opinion criminally obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Vice officers raided the arts center on April 7, the day the exhibit opened to 
the public, temporarily shutting down the show while they took photographs of 
the exhibit and served indictments. The center quickly got an injunction 
barring authorities from confiscating works or permanently closing the show. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, arts groups across the country have rallied to the center's 
support, and on Monday the Greater Cincinnati Gay and Lesbian Coalition will 
hold a demonstration outside the courthouse to protest the prosecutions, which 
they call harassment of homosexuals as well as of the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie said he believes a "national network" of anti-pornography crusaders is 
behind the Cincinnati protests and that the local citizens group probably 
received copies of the Mapplethorpe photographs from cohorts in Washington. 
Burress won't say where they got the photographs, but he accused Barrie of 
arrogance for not agreeing to take the most objectionable pieces out of the 
show before it opened. "They chose to push the issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Removing pieces from the show was never considered, said Barrie. The center did 
take the special step of displaying photographs depicting sadomasochistic poses 
in a separate room from the other work and allowing only people who were 18 or 
older into the room. 
</P>
<P>
Already, before the trial begins, the arts center has lost two important 
decisions before Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge David J. Albanese. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent one, earlier this month, Albanese ruled that the five 
photographs a grand jury found to be obscene will be considered individually 
rather than as part of the larger 175-piece exhibition, "Robert Mapplethorpe: 
The Perfect Moment," which was displayed in Cincinnati for two months last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition included many still lifes and portraits in addition to several 
photographs depicting sadomasochistic acts. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court, in its Miller vs. California decision in 1973, ruled 
that a work of art must be judged "as a whole" when determining whether it is 
obscene. Attorneys for the center had argued that the entire exhibition must be 
judged, but Albanese ruled that each photograph "exists as a single work of 
art." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means the center and Barrie may be found guilty if a jury finds only 
one of the photographs to be obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie could face a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine if he 
is found guilty. The center could face a fine of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The other important ruling came in June, when Albanese ruled that the arts 
center is not a museum as defined by Ohio law. The center's lawyers had argued 
that state law allowed museums to display even obscene works for educational 
and cultural purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite testimony which showed that the center is a member of the American 
Assn. of Museums and is recognized as a museum by art professionals across the 
country, the judge said it is an art gallery and therefore subject to 
prosecution under obscenity statutes.

O.C. DRUNK DRIVER JAILED -- FOR 19TH TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Edwin Wilson may be Orange County's most dangerous driver, but he was 
still on the road last week until a sharp-eyed fingerprint technician finally 
tracked him down. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Westminster tree-trimmer has been arrested for drunk driving 19 
times under five different aliases, his tangled court records show. Wilson has 
been fined, ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, had both real and fake 
driver's licenses revoked, and spent more than two years in Orange County Jail, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
All, apparently, to no avail. In a interview last week in Orange County Jail, 
where Wilson is being held on $100,000 bail after his arrest on a 12-count 
felony warrant, Wilson said he knows he is an alcoholic but continues to drive 
because he needs his truck to work. 
</P>
<P>
"When I know I'm drinking too much, I don't get in my vehicle," he said. "But 
when I black out, I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he does not remember whether he broadsided another driver in a 
hit-and-run accident in June, as police allege. He does remember waking up in 
jail unsure what name he had given to police. "Every one of the drunk drivings 
I've had has been a blackout," Wilson said. "I don't remember any of them." 
</P>
<P>
California has enacted a host of tougher drunk-driving laws since 1982, most of 
them aimed at making sure that first offenders do not transgress again. 
</P>
<P>
Among recent changes, the legal blood-alcohol level has been lowered from 0.10 
to 0.08. A four-time offender may be charged with a felony, and police may 
impound the cars of those driving with a suspended license. As of July 1, drunk 
drivers may also have their licenses confiscated on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a small but dangerous population of hard-core recidivists like Wilson 
continue to drive drunk. And authorities say it is virtually impossible to stop 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just of few of those out there, but they're walking time bombs," said 
Westminster Police Sgt. C. Russ Miller, who has encountered Wilson. "Even if 
you give them 30 days, it does absolutely no good." 
</P>
<P>
A Department of Motor Vehicle study found that at least 75% of Californians 
whose licenses had been suspended or revoked continued to drive anyway, and 
2.5% of drunk drivers give police false names, said Cliff Helander, DMV 
director of research. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Helander said, license revocation is effective in preventing 
accidents. "Even though they continue to drive, they drive less and they drive 
more carefully, because it becomes a feat for them to drive and not get 
caught." 
</P>
<P>
Helander said Wilson's case is one of the most extreme on record. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the worst cases I've ever heard of," Helander said, noting that 
he had heard unconfirmed tales of an Oakland man with 33 drunk-driving arrests. 
"I can say with a good deal of certainty that there aren't many people like 
this person." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster police and prosecutors said Wilson had managed to slip through the 
system by a combination of skillful deceit and foul-ups in the criminal records 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Among the problems, said Westminster Police Lt. Richard Main, is that the state 
no longer records misdemeanor offenses, including drunk driving, on the central 
criminal records computers. Further complicating matters, Wilson's first set of 
fingerprints were filed under an alias, making it difficult to keep his records 
straight, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Nina Brice and John Robinson, the county's 
chief deputy probation officer of field services, each declined to discuss the 
details of the Wilson case last week. Robinson, citing state statutes that 
forbid disclosure of criminal record information, said he could not confirm or 
deny that Wilson had ever been under the supervision of the County Probation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's records in Municipal Court in Westminster consist of at least seven 
tattered, confusing, cross-referenced manila files that contain warrants, 
citations, charges and DMV records dating back to his first arrest in 1978. In 
an interview, Wilson said he did use five aliases, including the names and 
driver's license numbers of two of his brothers. "They're really mad at me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he had also served at least one jail sentence under another fake 
name, Eugene Edward Burns. Eventually, he said, police began to recognize him 
by his aliases, and would book him under those names even when he gave them his 
real one. Nevertheless, he said, police would usually release him once he 
sobered up. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew who I was," Wilson said. "I don't know why they let me out. . . . 
They just let me go . . . and I wasn't going to say anything." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Wilson case was finally unraveled only because Richard J. Howie, 
an 18-year veteran fingerprint man at the Westminster Police Department, 
noticed an odd whorl on a set of prints back in July. 
</P>
<P>
Howie, a confessed workaholic, "remembers fingerprints the way other people 
remember faces," according to his boss, and once identified a notorious rapist 
by remembering a tiny scar on one of his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
About three times a week, Howie is called over to the courthouse and asked to 
fingerprint people who claim to have been misidentified or falsely arrested. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, Howie was asked to "roll prints" on a man who insisted that 
although his name was on a court summons, he had not been arrested for drunk 
driving. The man turned out of the one of Wilson's brothers, and indeed, his 
fingerprints did not match the alleged drunk driver's. 
</P>
<P>
But when Howie took a closer look at the original prints, he realized that he 
had seen them before. 
</P>
<P>
Howie said he spent hours sleuthing in his fingerprint files, as well as 
county, state and DMV fingerprint files -- a search usually conducted only on 
suspects in crimes far more serious than drunk driving. Finally, Howie said, he 
connected Wilson to the aliases, and concluded, "If I knew he was on the 
street, I would not go driving. Period." 
</P>
<P>
"The strange thing is every time he got arrested, he showed up (in court) and 
got fined and all that, and nobody ever picked up on who he was," Howie said. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 22, Wilson was charged with 12 counts, including felony drunk driving, 
driving in an unregistered car, driving on a revoked license, leaving the scene 
of an accident and giving a false name to police officers. A $50,000 warrant 
was issued for his arrest, an unprecedented amount for a drunk driver, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very eager to find him, obviously," said prosecutor Brice, who prepared 
the charges, on the day before Wilson was arrested. "He's a potential killer, 
just like the Night Stalker." 
</P>
<P>
Police and prosecutors said Wilson's blood-alcohol levels had been measured at 
0.28 -- more than three times the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only can he drive, but he's able to lie about his name and pull it off. . 
. . " said Sgt. Miller. "A normal person could not stand." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an Orange police officer who recognized Wilson from the County 
Jail spotted him, sober but behind the wheel. At his arraignment Friday, Wilson 
pleaded not guilty and Municipal Judge William L. Mock set bail at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is up to the courts to straighten out Wilson's tangled past. Court 
records show he was sentenced to jail twice, for six months in 1984 and 18 
months in 1987. Wilson, however, said he has served a total of five years in 
Orange County Jail, including 45 days for receiving stolen property, a charge 
which does not appear in his court files. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he could not remember exactly how many times he has been arrested, 
or how many times he's been sent to jail. He said he has tried to stop 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't drive for almost three months after I got out last summer," said 
Wilson, speaking into the telephone at the visiting room of the Orange County 
Jail. "Then I had one beer. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson insisted that he had asked repeatedly for treatment for his alcoholism 
while in prison, and had once been accepted into a program at the Roque Center, 
but a judge refused him admission. That and other details of the case could not 
be verified last week, but authorities said alcohol offenders are routinely 
required to complete drunk driving education programs or show proof of 
attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials said AA meetings are held three times a week in jail and all 
inmates are welcome. Wilson said he had accompanied friends to a few AA 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was OK, but I never really went enough to get into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Through the glass that separates inmates from visitors, Wilson's blue eyes 
appeared clear under a mass of long brown hair and a bushy beard, but the hand 
that held the telephone trembled. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm in here, I really don't think about (drinking) at all," he added. "I 
have the shakes and everything, but I've had the shakes for years. 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever get out of jail again, all I want to do is get out of this state and 
go somewhere it's wilderness, and I don't ever have to drive again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A SNAPSHOT OF HABITUAL DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>
<P>
REPEAT OFFENDERS 
</P>
<P>
Despite harsher penalties, recidivism among drunk drivers remains high. 
Department of Motor Vehicle studies have found that roughly 15% to 20% of those 
convicted of driving while intoxicated will be arrested again within one year, 
and 40% will be arrested again within four years. 
</P>
<P>
MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, about 250,000 Californians were convicted of driving while 
intoxicated. Of those, roughly 53,000 were second offenders, 18,000 were third 
offenders and 8,000, or 3%, had at least four previous convictions. 
</P>
<P>
FALSE NAMES 
</P>
<P>
About 2.5% of those arrested for driving while intoxicated give police false 
names or have more than one driver's license, a 1987 DMV study showed. Some 
drivers deliberately do not carry identification and give police the driver's 
license numbers of friends, relatives or strangers. If the description matches, 
and unless the fingerprints are on file locally, the offender is likely to be 
released before police know his true identity. 
</P>
<P>
LOW DETECTION RATE 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, drunk drivers are likely to be behind the wheel drunk many times 
between arrests. The DMV estimates that most violators must drive drunk from 
200 to 2,000 times before they are caught. 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE 
</P>
<P>
The DMV is working on a new system that would encode data about each driver -- 
including a physical description and a thumbprint -- on a digital strip on each 
driver's license. This would be a boon both to law enforcement and to merchants 
plagued by credit card fraud, DMV research director Cliff Helander said.

D.A. SEES GRAND JURY AS NEWEST CRIME WEAPON; 
</P>
<P>
PROSECUTION: PROPOSITION 115 CAN ALLOW INDICTMENTS BY THE PANEL TO STAND 
WITHOUT A PRELIMINARY HEARING. JURORS CAN NOW EXPECT TO HEAR MANY MORE CASES.

<P>
Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi smiles when he talks about a 
recent addition to the county's arsenal in its fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
It will help put gang killers, rapists and corrupt politicians behind bars, and 
will ease overcrowded criminal dockets and save money as well, Capizzi and 
other prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
The weapon is the grand jury. And while the institution has been around for 
hundreds of years as one of the hallmarks of the American and British legal 
systems, the grand jury in California fell into disuse for the past decade as a 
result of court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with passage of a court reform initiative in June, Capizzi said the grand 
jury has been fully restored as an independent and powerful tool of criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 115 is a major step in taking California out of 'Bird' land into 
which it had drifted and brought it back into a closer association with the 
federal system and other states which use the grand jury system effectively," 
Capizzi said last week. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to former California Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and the 
court's 1978 decision giving defendants indicted by grand juries the right to a 
subsequent hearing to determine if a full trial is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Those preliminary hearings, involving prosecutors, defense attorneys and 
witnesses, are often similar to the full-blown criminal trials that follow. In 
order to avoid, in effect, staging two trials in each case, prosecutors have 
largely discontinued the use of grand juries in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, nearly 700 criminal indictments were issued by grand juries in 
California, according to Gerald Uelmen, dean of Santa Clara University's School 
of Law. That number had dropped to the single digits in the late 1980s and 
Uelmen predicted that about 30 to 40 indictments would be issued this year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, under the terms of Proposition 115, the new court reform initiative, 
preliminary hearings can be eliminated in cases where a grand jury has issued 
an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among prosecutors' criticisms of preliminary hearings has been that 
defense attorneys used the system to beat down and intimidate key witnesses and 
crime victims, especially victims of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you how many rape victims have told me that they did not want to 
go through with a trial after having first been through a preliminary hearing," 
said Sterling Norris, acting chief deputy of special trials for the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have been using the hearings as a "whipping place" for crime 
victims because the hearings are simply meant to determine whether there is 
cause to proceed to trial and do not involve the presence of juries, Norris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I tell them (crime victims) that they would not be put through 
that ordeal in front of a jury, they say they would not want to go through that 
again," Norris said. "It has become a field for defense attorneys to castigate 
rape victims. Proposition 115 makes it much more of a truth-seeking proceeding 
again." 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney who is preparing a challenge to other provisions of the 
proposition before the state Supreme Court, which is scheduled in two weeks, 
said true preliminary hearings can actually provide incentives for criminals to 
plead guilty, speeding the criminal justice process. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney David Goodwin said that in preliminary hearings, where 
prosecutors present live witnesses for questioning, defendants can be convinced 
that strong cases have been prepared against them and will enter pleas of 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said the hearings also allow the prosecutors an 
opportunity in some cases "to realize his witnesses are turkeys." 
</P>
<P>
"It does take more time for attorneys," Goodwin said. "But it cuts both ways. 
What I understand is that it (the proposition) could reduce the guilty plea 
rate and that could result in chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi and Norris predict that a steady volume of criminal cases will now be 
routed through the grand jury for consideration and further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
They said grand jury consideration of their cases can cut weeks and, in some 
cases, months from pretrial proceedings in post-indictment preliminary 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Grand Jury Foreman Grant Baldwin said prosecutors have already 
notified his panel that it should be prepared to consider "significantly more" 
criminal cases because of Proposition 115. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury, typically composed of 19 citizens (23 in Los Angeles County) who 
sit for a term of one year, sits in secret. No attorneys except prosecutors are 
present. With no cross-examination of witnesses, as is allowed in preliminary 
hearings, cases routed through the grand jury move more quickly to trial, 
prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
In the context of a criminal case, grand juries traditionally have served as 
overseer of the work of prosecutors. Grand juries have the power to hear 
evidence of crimes, and decide whether prosecutors had gathered enough evidence 
to justify criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said he has not yet tested the powers of the grand jury under 
Proposition 115, but he said Orange County has spent thousands of dollars in 
taxpayers' money in recent prolonged preliminary hearings discussing matters 
that could have been settled in the grand jury in a fraction of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he pointed to the 14 months Orange County prosecutors spent in 
1989 and part of this year debating conspiracy and bid-rigging charges 
involving the Orange County Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
In the grand jury, he said the matter could have been ready for trial in a 
matter of a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Norris estimated that a pending gang-related case in Los Angeles County, 
involving a number of defendants, would take seven weeks to present in a 
preliminary hearing but only a matter of hours in the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"We determined that preliminary hearings were wasteful and involved" 
duplication of effort, said Capizzi, who worked as the Orange County 
co-chairman in the effort to pass the proposition. "Why go through the expense 
and judicial hoops? Why spend countless hours, days, weeks and months going 
through these hoops? I've been working for 10 years to eliminate the need for 
the post-indictment preliminary hearing." 
</P>
<P>
While prosecutors like Capizzi extol the restoration of the grand jury system, 
others claim the volume of criminal cases considered by the panels will not 
reach levels seen before the 1978 Supreme Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm picking up is a lot of talk about resisting efforts to have district 
attorneys taking over criminal indictments," Uelmen said. "I think they 
(prosecutors) will be very selective about what kinds of cases they take to the 
grand jury. I think they'll take child abuse cases, capital cases and political 
corruption-type cases," he said. Others have noted that such cases involving 
multiple defendants and or sensitive issues can be handled much easier in the 
quiet and secret grand jury setting. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Hawkins was a good decision because of the disparity in the 
treatment of defendants. I think we've kind of made a mistake (with Proposition 
115). I don't think it should be a tactical choice of whether a prosecutor goes 
for a grand jury or a preliminary hearing," Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Uelmen was referring to the 1978 Supreme Court decision James Hawkins vs. 
Superior Court of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the result of Proposition 115, Capizzi believes that it will certainly 
make California's grand jury system more compatible with the workings of grand 
juries in other states and those under federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
In most states, grand juries enjoy wide investigative powers and are generally 
the most potent resource prosecutors can use to bring criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, California grand juries have focused their work on their 
watchdog role over local government operations.

DANA PARSONS: WALK AWAY FROM LIFE? YOU CAN GET THERE FROM HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first sentence of the story in the Friday Times caught my attention: "For 
everyone who has ever wanted to leave life behind and start all over again with 
an entirely new identity. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Leave life behind. Start all over again. Entirely new identity. 
</P>
<P>
Where do I sign? 
</P>
<P>
The story was about the San Diego County man who walked out on his life 14 
years ago in Maryland. He left his wallet, his car, his private papers and a 
goodby note. Only in the last year has he confessed to his new family about his 
previous life. 
</P>
<P>
The man's story was tinged with sadness, because emotional problems were what 
apparently led him to drop out 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But are there many among us who haven't entertained the thought of coming home 
some night at 6, packing some clean underwear, getting in the car and hitting 
the highway? 
</P>
<P>
Kiss it all goodby. 
</P>
<P>
I offered that scenario to 10 people, randomly selected while shopping at 
Fountain Valley's Price Club. Let me clarify: They were shopping at Price Club, 
not me. 
</P>
<P>
This was my proposition: If there weren't family considerations to take into 
account and if they could start all over tomorrow, where would they go and what 
would they do? 
</P>
<P>
Here are the answers, in no particular order: 
</P>
<P>
Richard, 34, of Santa Ana: "If I could chuck it all, there are a couple things 
I'd probably do. I'd probably end up in Guadalajara, Mexico. What I'd do, I 
don't know. Probably start a business of some sort, some kind of international 
business venture." 
</P>
<P>
Hattie, mid-40s, Mission Viejo: "Sedona, Arizona. I love it. I like the 
mountains, the creeks and everything. It's so beautiful there. I'd find a job 
in real estate or insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Alastair, 23, Newport Beach: "I always wanted to be a game show host. I'd go to 
some South Pacific island, like Vanua Vatu, and have the production facilities 
there and have a game show. It'd be a very exclusive show, hard to get on." 
</P>
<P>
Maryann, 32, Huntington Beach: "I'd go out in the country and own a little 
restaurant or retail store." 
</P>
<P>
Pat, 68, Westminster: "Maybe some small villa in Mexico and just hustle 
tourists for a buck. They've got some nice senoritas down there." 
</P>
<P>
Judy, 45, Huntington Beach: "I'd go to New York and become an accountant." 
</P>
<P>
George, 62, Santa Ana: "I'd go to Alaska, get a cabin and just live." 
</P>
<P>
Charlene, 37, Huntington Beach: "Heaven, in a minute." Pressed for a more 
earthly escape, she said, "British Columbia. I'd go there and sail. I'd be on a 
yacht and sail around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 43, Costa Mesa: "I'd probably go someplace like Montana, Oregon, Idaho 
or Washington and do real estate deals. Build houses one at a time. You could 
work four months a year and sit on your butt for eight." 
</P>
<P>
Karen, 34, Trabuco Canyon: "I'd go live on a beach in Baja and say forget it to 
mortgage payments, work and all the hassles of living in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, those aren't exactly exotic fantasies. I was thinking more along 
the lines of being a gondolier in Venice or a ski instructor in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe most people's dreams aren't as far removed from reality as we might 
think. I can understand why Alastair doesn't start his game show on a Pacific 
island, but I wonder why Hattie, for example, doesn't just move to Sedona. Or 
why Scott, a firefighter, doesn't move to the Northwest. Folks, you can get 
there from here. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we just get too rooted, too complacent. Maybe it takes too much energy, 
or a spouse or parent doesn't want you to move, or they discourage you from 
opening that boutique in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
I have a friend who, like me, has said his fond farewells to youth and is 
getting to know middle age on a personal basis. We talk about running away 
together and going into the house-painting business. We always get bogged down, 
however, over whether it'll be interior or exterior painting. If it's interior 
work, I'm afraid the fumes would get to me. If it's exterior, I mention that 
I'm afraid of wasps flying around eaves. 
</P>
<P>
So, the dream never takes off. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I'm just making excuses. Maybe I don't really want to be a painter, 
interior or exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I agree with what Pat, the 68-year-old man from Westminster, said outside 
Price Club: "We're all stuck with what we've got."

AN UPHILL BATTLE TO HALT CLEAN AIR BILL; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: REP. DANNEMEYER IS SEEMINGLY FIGHTING FOR A LOST CAUSE IN TRYING TO 
BLOCK CHANGES IN THE LAW. BUT HE MAY GET DORNAN'S SUPPORT.

<P>
In his dozen years in Congress, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer has embraced more 
than his share of quixotic conservative causes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fullerton Republican, who represents part of the smoggiest region in 
the nation, may be tilting at the biggest windmill of his career in opposing 
sweeping new clean air legislation that is all but sure to win final 
congressional approval in the coming weeks. One of the negotiators seeking to 
reconcile conflicting House and Senate versions of the clean air bill, 
Dannemeyer is not likely to derail, or even slow, the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But his loud protests that new clean air legislation will cost industry and 
consumers too much money in tough economic times has raised concerns among 
other Orange County congressmen, and highlights a growing split in the county's 
congressional delegation over environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) said last week that he may switch 
positions and join Dannemeyer in opposing the final clean air bill that emerges 
from the ongoing House-Senate conference. Dornan had voted for the House 
version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I've decided no, now is not the time to go spending billions of dollars more" 
on pollution controls, Dornan said, "so I'll probably go along with 
Dannemeyer." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he is also rethinking his recent change of heart about drilling for 
oil off the California coast. A longtime supporter of offshore drilling, Dornan 
changed his position this spring, he said, "not knowing that Saddam Hussein was 
going to go psycho." Dannemeyer strongly favors offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who has earned high marks from 
environmentalists, and Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who represents southern 
Orange County, said they remain committed to enacting a new clean air bill this 
year, although both expressed some concerns about the cost of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"To say that the bill can be improved is not to say that we shouldn't have it 
at all," Cox said. "We need to make some progress on clean air, and we need to 
do so fast." 
</P>
<P>
Added Packard: "The Los Angeles air basin has got to be cleaned up." Both Cox 
and Packard strongly oppose oil drilling off California. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), who represents northwestern Orange 
County, "is going to wait and see" what the final clean air legislation looks 
like before making up his mind, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer was one of only 21 members -- and the only Californian -- who voted 
against the House version of the clean air bill when it was overwhelmingly 
approved last May. Cox, Rohrabacher and Packard, along with Dornan, voted in 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's tough stand against new clean air legislation, and his 
increasingly strident attacks on those whom he calls "environmental 
extremists," have been noticed in the environmental community. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressman Dannemeyer is a much stronger advocate for the oil companies and 
the big polluters' interests than for the people of Orange County who are 
forced to breathe the dirtiest air in the nation," said Daniel J. Weiss, 
Washington director of the environmental quality program for the Sierra Club, 
one of the largest environmental groups in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is better to err on the side of protection of human health than 
err on the side of industry profits, which is what Mr. Dannemeyer would do," 
Weiss added. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer, a longtime friend of the oil industry, shrugs off the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"The existing provisions of the Clean Air Act have worked effectively to 
significantly improve air quality, not only in Southern California, but around 
the country," he said last week. "Legislation in this area should be based on 
science, not on fear or emotion. . . . What is needed is to let the law alone." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fought very long and hard for this," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), who wrote the House version of the legislation and who is 
Dannemeyer's longtime foe on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"What the Clean Air Act has most to do with is protecting people's health," 
Waxman added, "and that means reducing the pollution that is causing additional 
health burdens to the elderly, to children, to asthmatics and others." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club estimates that 150 million Americans live in the about 100 
metropolitan areas where air quality fails to meet the planned new standards. 
</P>
<P>
So far, House and Senate negotiators have reached an accord on the core of what 
promises to be the first major revision of the nation's clean air laws since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-page Title I of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act is intended to 
dramatically reduce industrial pollution in the nation's smoggiest cities by 
targeting even the smallest polluters, such as bakeries, breweries and auto 
body shops. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would mandate adoption of new state pollution cleanup plans that 
would require industrial polluters to slash emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen 
oxides and other smog-forming compounds by installing smoke scrubbers and other 
anti-pollution devices. 
</P>
<P>
But many contentious issues remain unresolved, including provisions that would 
set tougher tailpipe emission standards into the next century, promote the 
development of cleaner fuels and cars that burn them, reduce acid rain by 
cutting the use of high-sulfur coal in power plants, and limit the release of a 
host of toxic compounds by oil refineries, steel mills and other industrial 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
One study commissioned by an industry group placed an annual price tag on the 
most expensive provisions of the House and Senate bills, taken together, at up 
to $91 billion. But the White House Council of Economic Advisers has said that 
even the highest-priced sections of the legislation, lumped into a single bill, 
would cost no more than $35 billion a year by the early 21st Century. 
Separately, the House and Senate bills each would cost industry about $25 
billion a year, the council has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists insist that the health benefits of cleaning up the air would 
far outweigh the costs to industry, but industry groups strongly disagree. 
</P>
<P>
The region that makes up Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties has the worst air in the nation, and would be subject to the strictest 
provisions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Even though local pollution-control measures planned for or already in effect 
in Southern California are more stringent than those that would be imposed by 
the new federal legislation, the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act are 
likely to have a profound impact on the Southland, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"The (federal) program is going to help California a lot," said S. William 
Becker, executive director of the Assn. of Local Air Pollution Control 
Officials, a Washington-based organization. "One fourth of (California's) 
pollution comes from outside the state. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials are particularly concerned about a provision in the 
House-passed version of the clean air bill that would, in effect, give the 
Environmental Protection Agency veto power over major new transportation 
projects. Technically, the provision would require the EPA to certify that 
projects such as freeway expansions or new toll roads are in compliance with 
state pollution control plans. That decision now is left to the U.S. Department 
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are air quality improvements that are needed in the basin," said 
Michael M. Ruane, director of the Orange County Environmental Management 
Agency, but "I don't think there's any assurance that adding a veto power (for 
the EPA) on a project-by-project basis would necessarily enhance our 
attainment. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The EPA veto issue is likely to be one of the last resolved by the House-Senate 
conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer, meanwhile, is incensed about his colleagues' response to a 10-year, 
$500-million study of the causes and effects of acid rain, one of the major 
types of pollution to be addressed by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the study concludes that reducing sulfur dioxide emissions 
by 8 million tons a year, instead of the 10 million tons contemplated under the 
clean air amendments, would cost about 50% less, or between $1.7 billion and 
$2.7 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is tragic that we are permitting ourselves to be boxed into the position 
where we have accepted a political number of 10 million tons, with no 
scientific justification whatsoever," Dannemeyer said.

A 61-year-old man shot and killed himself after wounding his ex-wife wife 
during what police said was a domestic quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
Reza Rostami was found dead in a back entryway of his home in the 4700 block of 
Winvale Avenue on Saturday afternoon with a single gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
His ex-wife, Tina Rostami, 40, was listed in good condition at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana with a gunshot wound to the lower abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who were called to the home about 12:20 p.m. Saturday, said the ex-wife 
had dropped by Reza Rostami's home, and shortly after her arrival the quarrel 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigator Pete Linton said Reza Rostami then pulled a handgun and 
shot Tina Rostami while she was in the kitchen. He said the man retreated to 
the rear of the house where he turned the gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
"She (the ex-wife) came over, and they got cranked up over something," Linton 
said. "The matter just boiled over. It's very unfortunate. It's something that 
could happen to a lot of people at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Linton said police were still trying to determine what started the quarrel.

CLEANUP: ABOUT 700 PEOPLE PITCHED IN TO HELP RID UPPER NEWPORT BAY OF TRASH AS 
PART OF STATEWIDE EVENT.

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Goldenberg and his 16-year-old pal, Pontus Oberg, used to consider the 
Upper Newport Bay a primo windsurfing spot. 
</P>
<P>
But they have long since beached their boards for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to stop because the bay's getting pretty nasty," said Goldenberg, 17, 
of Dover Shores. The Back Bay "was nice before, but it looks kind of terrible 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the herculean task of cleaning up the 752 acres of wetlands that 
make up much of the Upper Newport Bay, the teen-age friends and about 700 other 
volunteers combed through the marshy clumps of pickleweed and cordgrass for 
three hours on Saturday, trying to make a dent in the tons of garbage that have 
been deposited over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The effort, appropriately called the Upper Newport Bay Cleanup Day, was held in 
conjunction with the sixth annual Adopt-A-Beach California Coastal Cleanup, 
sponsored by the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Up and down the state's 1,000 miles of coastline, thousands of people armed 
with blue and orange trash bags and tally sheets turned out at their favorite 
beach to pick up, analyze and catalogue the trash they encountered, the Coastal 
Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the statewide project, which lasted from 9 a.m. to noon, was to 
raise awareness about the fragility of the California coastline and to instill 
a year-round habit of keeping the state's beaches pristine, said Thomas Gwyn, 
chairman of the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Californians love their coast," Gwyn said in a prepared statement. "We want to 
care for it, not just on this day, but all year round." 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Commission officials said that last year's event drew 10,000 children 
and adults who picked up more than 200,000 pounds of trash. 
</P>
<P>
That was more than double the number of people who turned out in 1988, Coastal 
Commission officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Figures for Saturday's event were not be immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures are a two-edged sword, said Coastal Commission spokesman Jack 
Liebster. On the one hand they show that a growing number of people are taking 
the time to make clean beaches a reality. 
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, "the cleanup statistics are a sad and obvious indicator 
that California continues to suffer from a plague of trash," he wrote in a 
recent report. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains of trash are catalogued, and used to help identify polluters and 
the type of trash being deposited into the ocean, Coastal Commission officials 
said. Accurately tallying the debris will also help foster new environmental 
legislation, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, because of careless dumping of trash, tens of thousands of marine 
mammals, birds and fish die from eating or becoming entangled in trash, the 
Coastal Commission reported. For instance, it is estimated that 30,000 northern 
fur seals die each year from entanglement with plastic and other floating 
garbage, according to the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In light of that, Orange County officials and organizations from San Clemente 
to Seal Beach joined the statewide environmental cleanup by recruiting about 
3,000 volunteers to walk up and down the sand, picking up cigarette butts, soda 
cans, plastic foam products and other rubbish, said Marianne Excell, a County 
Harbors, Beaches and Parks spokeswoman and coordinator for the countywide 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I think it was very successful," Excell said. "The public really 
enjoys doing this and I definitely feel that it was great for preserving our 
resources and protecting our environment." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers working at the various beaches agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful idea," said Nadine Henning as she watched her 9-year-old 
daughter get a quick lesson on how to spot coin-sized bits of trash hidden in 
the sand at Huntington State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"This teaches my daughter environmental responsibility," she said as organizer 
Warren Kirsch barked orders to the members of the Fountain Valley Girl Scout 
troop, who were mixing business with pleasure by playing a game called "100% 
Clean Up." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to teach them when they are young and give them good habits," Henning 
said. "When you get older, it's more of a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Huntington Beach resident Ernie Pellegrini, 27, and his girlfriend 
sifted through an ash-filled cement bonfire ring, picking up charred metal 
debris and fast-food wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
He lamented the condition of Huntington Beach, which draws hundreds of 
thousands of tourists a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I come to this beach all the time," Pellegrini said. "It's really disgusting 
to see all the trash. Every bit of trash ruins it for everyone."

MANY BOATERS SUSPECTED OF USING HARBORS AS SEWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boating, a popular pastime for many county residents and a symbol of the area's 
affluence, is also helping to transform two of the county's three harbors into 
virtual septic tanks, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Negligent boaters, disregarding state and federal laws, for years have been 
emptying their on-board toilets into Huntington Harbour and Newport Bay, 
exposing swimmers to diseases and killing sea life, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real problem," said Gerald G. Johnston, a deputy district attorney 
specializing in environmental crime prosecution. "There are indications that a 
number of boats in the area are doing this, although it's not permitted by 
law." 
</P>
<P>
Boaters can legally dispose of on-board wastes by either dumping at sea or 
hooking up to a sewer system at harbor pump stations. Most comply, officials 
said, but a handful of violators have caused the growing pollution problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude is that (dumping) once won't hurt. But once does hurt," said Sgt. 
Harry Gage, harbor master of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, authorities said, is enforcing the law. Unless violators are 
caught dumping, it is virtually impossible to prosecute them. 
</P>
<P>
Until federal law was amended three years ago, local agencies depended upon 
federal law-enforcement agencies to monitor and cite offenders. Since then, 
however, Newport Beach has adopted five ordinances enabling the city to 
prosecute offenders, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Huntington Beach City Council introduced an ordinance Sept. 17 that 
would impose strict guidelines for dumping, along with tough penalties for 
violators. The council is scheduled to consider adopting the measure Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Head dumping," as many authorities refer to the problem, in recent years has 
been suspected as a leading cause of the harbors' exceedingly high levels of 
coliform bacteria, produced by human or animal fecal matter. 
</P>
<P>
Samples taken from the harbors in the last five years have consistently shown 
coliform levels exceeding state standards, according to a recent report 
compiled by the Orange County Health Care Agency's environmental division. 
</P>
<P>
According to state regulations, coliform levels exceeding 1,000 organisms per 
100 milliliters of water are unsafe for swimming and other water sports. 
Samples taken from some of the harbors' monitoring stations in April, May and 
June this year revealed levels up to 16 times that standard, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Bay's waters are by far the most sullied by coliform, the study shows. 
During May, for example, 11 of its 27 stations reportedly produced contaminated 
samples at least 20% of the time, identifying those sites as not complying with 
state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
During the same month, two of Huntington Harbour's 12 monitoring stations 
consistently revealed high levels of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's third harbor, Dana Point, has had coliform levels that have met 
state standards throughout the last five years, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say that county residents who wash animal fecal matter, organic 
fertilizer and similar substances into gutters along the streets create much of 
the coliform pollution, since storm drains empty into both Huntington Harbour 
and Newport Bay. Consequently, contamination levels are typically much higher 
after rain, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
But officials have long suspected that waste dumping by commercial and 
recreational boats has also been a chief contributor to the problem, although 
few violators have been caught in the act. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know that's the case, but there is at least a perception that vessel 
waste is a problem," Sgt. Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to differentiate between the sources of contamination, but 
Gage's staff has occasionally turned up evidence, such as toilet tissue in the 
water, that point to vessel dumping, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said Coast Guard inspections have shown that the waste systems of many 
boats are set up so it is possible to dump wastes easily and quickly into the 
harbor with little chance of detection. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rare occasions in which a violator was actually caught illegally 
dumping occurred in Newport Bay earlier this year, when a charter boat expelled 
its waste on top of an unsuspecting scuba diver, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
The diver pressed charges and Johnston successfully prosecuted the boat owner, 
who was fined. 
</P>
<P>
No offenders have been caught, Johnston said, in Huntington Harbour, which is 
part of Huntington Beach. City officials hope that their proposed ordinance 
will help identify violators. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would mandate that all boat owners renting slips in Huntington 
Harbour place dye tablets in their on-board waste tanks. Any discharge would 
expel a deep green cloud into the water, making it easier to spot illegal 
dumping. 
</P>
<P>
The boat-slip lease or harbor rental agreement would automatically be revoked 
for any owner whose vessel, upon inspection, lacked the dye tablets. Also, any 
harbor operator whose boat tenants do not have active tablets in place would 
risk losing his conditional-use permit, which the city controls. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is based upon regulations in effect for the last two years at 
Santa Catalina Island's Avalon Harbor, Huntington Beach Councilman Jim Silva 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Silva is the chairman of the Huntington Harbour Water Committee and has led the 
drive for the Huntington Beach ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"This would give us a vehicle of enforcement to go after these people," Silva 
said. "For example, if someone (who is dumping illegally) has a rented dock at 
Peter's Landing, we can go after Peter's Landing by pulling its use permit." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the stringent proposal, Linda Rouan, marina operator 
at Peter's Landing, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities said Avalon's ordinance, which fines violators and bars them 
from the island harbor for a year, has been highly effective. 
</P>
<P>
"In Avalon, though," Gage said, "city employees have been charged with putting 
tablets in the (boat) tanks, so it's been very costly. But this Huntington 
Beach ordinance is very innovative. By placing the onus on the marina 
operators, it causes them to become more involved." 
</P>
<P>
However, some critics remain skeptical. Louann Murray, a Huntington Beach 
biologist and member of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an environmental group, said: 
"You still have to be watching (a violation in progress), and you have to have 
boat owners' compliance, so I don't see how it will be enforceable." 
</P>
<P>
John Ludvigsen, environmental officer for the Newport Beach Police Department, 
said he believes that the ordinance may be effective in Huntington Harbour.

DRIVER HITS LIGHT POLE, CUTS POWER TO RESIDENCES

<P>
The driver of a green Cadillac delivered a knockout blow to a sturdy light pole 
early Saturday, cutting off power to about 1,600 residences on the city's 
southwest side, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cadillac ran off the road at Placentia Avenue and 20th Street at 2:39 a.m. 
and sheared off the pole, downing electric lines and cutting power to 
residences for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
And just as police thought they had the mess contained, another driver plowed 
through barricades set up at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Cadillac, Mario Rebolliar, 21, of Costa Mesa, and the other 
driver, Luis Fernandez, 25, also of Costa Mesa, were charged with driving under 
the influence of alcohol and were arrested at the scene. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police could not estimate how fast the Cadillac was traveling at the time of 
impact, but Police Lt. Gary Webster said: 
</P>
<P>
"It had to be putting along pretty good to knock one of those poles off." 
</P>
<P>
Although power was restored in the area, Webster said it will take at least 24 
hours to install a new pole.

BULLDOZING INDIANS' SACRED HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HAYS, Scott Hays is a regular contributor to Orange County View.

<TEXT>
<P>
North American Indians always have held close spiritual ties with their 
ancestors. So when charges surface that human remains and religious artifacts 
from sacred Indian burial grounds have been unearthed by developers and tossed 
in a scrap heap, kin groups and tribal elders go on the warpath. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the remains of our people are sacred," says Vera Rocha, chairwoman 
of the Gabrieleno Indian Tribe, whose ancestors once occupied the hilly lands 
near Newport Beach. "Every time one of our burial sites gets destroyed, a piece 
of our religion also gets destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is fast becoming a treasure trove of fossils and cultural 
resources with historical significance. Indian villages and burial grounds are 
scattered throughout the county, and as residential and commercial construction 
continues many more are likely to be found. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. has spent roughly $6 million over the last three years on 
excavations within the 9,432-acre Newport Coast property between Corona del Mar 
and Laguna Beach. To date, the project has yielded natural rock shelters, 
grinding tools and spearheads, and the remains of a young Indian woman who 
lived 4,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
These treasures and others have allowed researchers and archeologists to study 
the Indians who once inhabited the area -- Gabrielenos and Juanenos. Human 
remains, in particular, help reveal a culture's diet, environment, evolution. 
</P>
<P>
But members of these two tribes say that development has not only threatened 
the sacred sites along the coast and elsewhere but has sent the spirits and 
souls of their ancestors into a sort of earthly void -- all in the name of 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Our religious beliefs deserve the same respect as anyone else's," Rocha says. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more than 12,000 American Indians living in Orange County are 
starting to assert their right to speak to the final destination of their 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a strong revival of Indian culture and an increasing awareness of 
their political and social identity, Indian leaders have organized protests and 
demanded that developers leave the bones of their ancestors undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people should not be removed with a scooper and a hopper," argues David 
Belardes, chief of the San Juan Capistrano-based Juaneno Indian tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how best to protect the bones and burial sites already found, 
and those yet to be found, still remains at the center of a dispute among 
Indian groups and developers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, developers performed only cursory review of Indian burial grounds, 
says Michael Macko, former archeological director at the Newport Coast project. 
Macko surveyed the unincorporated area where the Irvine Co. now is building 
2,600 housing units. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until a few years ago, it was helter-skelter review," Macko says. 
</P>
<P>
These days, archeological and paleontological studies are routine. Under state 
law, American Insians' remains that are unearthed by developers either must be 
turned over to the most likely descendant or reburied within the project site. 
</P>
<P>
Of 92 archeological sites identified on the Newport Coast property, 67 will be 
preserved in open space -- Crystal Cove State Park and Irvine Coast Wilderness 
Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
So far, researchers have found evidence of two Indian groups. The first tribe 
arrived about 9,000 years ago but mysteriously vanished. The second tribe 
arrived about 1,500 years ago and used bows and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize they're not going to stop development because of a few arrowheads," 
says Belardes of the Juanenos. "But if we can't stop progress, at least allow 
us some dignity in how we bury our ancestors." 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of sites offer little more than "shell debris and rock 
features," says Robert Selway, chief of cultural and historical programs for 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it's not as though developers and Indian leaders are fighting over mere 
fragments. Or are they? 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, for example, the Juanenos asked the Mission Viejo Co. to allow 
tribal representatives on site during grading of an area near where the remains 
of 11 Indians were found in 1978. The company refused their request since state 
law already required it to have on site a certified archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and Indian groups still have yet to agree on the extent of the find 
at Hellman Ranch in Seal Beach. The Mola Development Co. conducted a subsurface 
investigation and found one finger digit. "The site was never classified as a 
burial, but some people are using this to try and stop development," says Kirk 
Evans, project manager for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly charred bones have surfaced at Pelican Hill in the Newport Coast project 
-- quite possibly the largest single archeological excavation in California. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers claim that these delays in construction schedules merely drive 
up their cost of doing business, thus raising prices of new homes. 
</P>
<P>
A few developers such as the Irvine Co., however, hire on-site Indian monitors 
or consultants when artifacts are likely to be found. Monitors ensure that 
sensitive burial sites are not disturbed and Indian relics are preserved. 
Occasionally, these monitors perform reburials. 
</P>
<P>
The requirements for Indian monitoring vary from county to county, and state 
guidelines are vague. Developers have complained about the fees charged by 
Indians, while the issue of who qualifies as a likely descendant has started 
tribal warfares among American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of developers don't use Native Americans as monitors because we've 
gotten a bad rap over the years for charging big bucks and then standing around 
doing nothing," Belardes says. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Valasques is a coastal Gabrieleno descendant and is employed as an Indian 
observer at the Newport Coast project. He also is on the Irvine Co. payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever human remains are discovered, I am consulted as to how I would like 
to dispose of them," he explains. "My job is to see that they are exhumed by 
hand with dignity and returned to the earth with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the remains from the Newport Coast project were placed in a wooden box 
about the size of a small suitcase and reburied. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not always sure what's going on with regard to reburials," says Rocha of 
the Gabrieleno Indian Tribe, who has long refused to recognize Valasques as a 
member of the tribe. "We're typically informed about these burials at the last 
minute when everything is either plowed under or bulldozed. Up until a month 
ago, we were involved in only one reburial." 
</P>
<P>
A powwow, of sorts, was held earlier this year between one developer, the 
Irvine Co., and the Gabrielenos and Juanenos. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. assured the two Indian tribes that they will have a new role in 
monitoring future archeological digs. 
</P>
<P>
"All the human remains and funeral-related items found on the Newport Coast 
site have been returned to Mother Earth," insists Bernard Maniscalco, project 
director for the Irvine Co. "All other artifacts will be donated to the Orange 
County Museum of Natural History and Science." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the company is eager to turn over the artifacts and to put to rest all 
Indian remains and descendants' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, this is a racial issue because we're not digging up the bones of any 
other ethnic group," says Dr. Dudley Varner, executive director of the Orange 
County Museum of Natural History and Science. "But the Irvine Co. has done 
everything in its power to mitigate the issue of burial sites and 
funeral-related artifacts." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists typically excavate about 5% of artifacts before the bulldozers 
level the land. The Irvine Co. reviewed close to 20% of the Newport Coast area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a matter of sampling," says Roger Mason, current archeology director 
at Newport Coast. "Do you have a big enough sample? That decision has to be 
made on a site-by-site basis." (A final report on the human remains and 
religious artifacts found at Newport Coast will be released sometime next 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
Human remains probably can be found at every one of the roughly 1,200 recorded 
archeological sites in Orange County, says Belardes of the Juanenos and Macko. 
The problem is it's like finding a needle in a haystack. Meanwhile, battle 
cries from developers and Indian leaders continue to echo in Orange County 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't profess to have all the answers, but we're talking about our cultural 
heritage," adds Belardes. "If we don't do something now, we're not going to 
have a heritage." 
</P>

AGREEMENT REACHED ON MALL IN SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita will collect at least $137 million in sales taxes in return for 
providing financial aid for an 80-acre regional mall proposed by Newhall Land 
&amp; Farming Co., city officials announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will allow Newhall Land to proceed with the long-awaited Valencia 
Town Center, the first major retail outlet in the Santa Clarita Valley, and 
funnel the $137 million into the city treasury over 30 years, Assistant City 
Manager Ken Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, expected to be approved Tuesday by the City Council, Santa 
Clarita would issue bonds to pay for $9.95 million in road improvements needed 
for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be paid off with 16% of the sales taxes collected at the mall 
over 30 years, Pulskamp said. The city would not be required to dip into its 
general fund for the money, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land officials initially had requested $12.8 million in aid. Also, as 
an enticement, Newhall Land officials said Santa Clarita could annex 150 acres 
of company property. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials won additional concessions in negotiations, which began in 
July. Newhall Land, the region's major landholder, agreed to permit the 
annexation of 406 acres of commercial land it owns south of Newhall Ranch Road 
and west of Bouquet Canyon Road. The company also agreed to grant the city 
easements for 4.5 miles of hiking trails along the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land officials said the $180-million mall project could not be built 
without financial aid from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents urged the city not to subsidize a private enterprise. But 
Newhall Land officials argued that other California cities, including Palmdale 
and Burbank, had agreed to subsidize new malls by floating bonds to be paid off 
with sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated development Friday, Public Works Director John Medina announced 
that Santa Clarita will begin a curbside recycling program Oct. 18, with a 
first phase involving 3,000 households. The program, to be presented to the 
council Tuesday, may include the entire city by next April, Medina said.

CREAM OF THE CROP: SOUTHLAND'S TOP PREP PLAYERS; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: AFTER DOWN SEASON, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S TALENT POOL IS BUBBLING OVER 
WITH BLUE-CHIP PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Lascola, who operates the Fallbrook, Calif.-based Scouting Evaluation 
Assn., said the prep football talent pool in Southern California last season 
was disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"But we strung together five good years in a row," he said. "So I guess we were 
due for a bad year." 
</P>
<P>
Lascola and other scouts who annually canvas the Southland in search of top 
college prospects said the talent level is up this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a pretty good year," says Houston-based super scout Max 
Emfinger. "There (are) some really good people out there this year." 
</P>
<P>
Lascola said the talent crop is especially deep at defensive back, offensive 
tackle and running back. It is noticeably thin at quarterback, wide receiver 
and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Among the top-rated players this season are running back Napoleon Kaufman of 
Lompoc and offensive tackle Robert Loya of Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lascola and Emfinger, national recruiting services such as G 
&amp; W Recruiting Report of Pennsylvania, Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report 
of Illinois, SuperPrep magazine of Costa Mesa and the Florida-based Steve 
Smith's Blue Chip report also determine which Greater Los Angeles and Orange 
County seniors are rated among the best players. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana and El Toro each have two players on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in no particular order, are the Terrific 22: 
</P>
<P>
Rob Johnson (El Toro, quarterback) -- It may be a down year for quarterbacks in 
the Southland, but Johnson could be the exception. If the name sounds familiar, 
his brother Bret was starting quarterback at UCLA last season. At 6-foot-4 and 
210 pounds, he is bigger than his brother and has a powerful throwing arm. An 
all-around athlete, Johnson was All-Southern Section in football, baseball and 
basketball as a junior. Playing sparingly at quarterback last season, he 
completed 20 of 25 passes for 550 yards and should have little difficulty 
making the transition from wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon Kaufman (Lompoc, running back) -- He was the highest-ranked player on 
the Terrific 22. One of the swiftest players in the nation, the 5-9, 170-pound 
Kaufman has speed and moves that one scouting service compared to Notre Dame's 
Raghib Ismail. He won the 100 and 200 meters at the state track meet in June 
and runs the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds. As a junior, he gained 2,954 
all-purpose yards and scored 39 touchdowns and averaged a remarkable 70 yards 
on kickoff returns. He also played defensive back and had four interceptions 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont Warren (Dorsey, running back) -- If Kaufman is the best running back in 
the state, Warren is not far behind. Some scouts rate him higher than Kaufman. 
At 6-1 and 185, he has more size and speed with a 4.4 time in the 40. He also 
finished second in the state in the 400 meters in June. A slashing runner, he 
rushed for 1,350 yards and 25 touchdowns and caught 20 passes for 205 yards. 
"It is rare when you find a back with all the tools Lamont possesses," said the 
Lemming report. He also is an excellent defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks (Mater Dei, running back) -- He transferred to Mater Dei after 
playing his first game of the season at Montclair Prep. As a junior, the 6-1 
and 208-pound Sparks produced some impressive rushing figures for the Mounties. 
His totals of 1,944 yards and 32 touchdowns in 210 carries last year and more 
than 3,300 yards in two seasons attracted a great deal of attention from 
colleges. Scouts describe him as a power back with great moves, vision and 
more-than-adequate 4.5 speed in the 40. He bench presses 320 pounds and also 
plays linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Ontiwaun Carter (Granada Hills Kennedy, running back) -- In an exceptional year 
for running backs, Carter joins Sparks as another prized player from the San 
Fernando Valley. At 5-10 and 175, he does not have outstanding size but makes 
up for that with speed, strength and durability. He runs the 40 in 4.5 and has 
bench pressed 350 pounds. Carter has rushed for 2,753 yards and 21 touchdowns 
in his first two seasons at Kennedy, including 1,563 yards and 11 touchdowns 
last year. Recruiters also think he could to play cornerback in college. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Neal (Paramount, running back) -- Small is big this year in the Southland. 
Neal, 5-9 and 170 pounds, is another undersized running back who is receiving a 
look from recruiters. Last season he rushed for 1,729 yards and 23 touchdowns 
and averaged more than 12 yards a carry. Also a good pass receiver, he combines 
exceptional quickness with leaping ability and lateral movement. A good 
all-around athlete and outstanding student, his best moves in college could 
come at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Jones (Westchester, wide receiver) -- One of the best all-around 
athletes on the Terrific 22, Jones is usually mentioned first as a receiver and 
then as a defensive back, but could easily wind up playing either position in 
college because of his size and speed. A transfer from St. Monica, he is 6-3 
and 190 pounds and runs the 40 in 4.5. As a junior, he caught 32 passes for 606 
yards and 10 touchdowns and demonstrated his explosive qualities by returning 
four punts and two interceptions for scores. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Rosborough (Long Beach Jordan, wide receiver) -- An athlete who might be 
able to pick his sport for college, the 6-3 and 175-pound Rosborough is equally 
adept in football and basketball. Depending on what scout you believe, he can 
also play at either wide receiver or defensive back. As a receiver with 4.5 
speed, he combines good leaping ability and hands and is considered a big-play 
threat. On defense, he has the instincts to excel at safety. He also averaged 
15 points for the basketball team last season. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Finch (Riverside Ramona, offensive lineman) -- As talented as the list of 
running backs appears to be, the pool of interior linemen is even deeper. One 
of the most talented is Finch, 6-6 and 265 pounds, who has excelled on both 
sides of the line for a Ramona squad that has produced several big linemen. G 
&amp; W Recruiting Report rates him the No. 1 offensive line prospect in the 
state. He is a fierce blocker with superb technique and more-than-adequate foot 
speed. The biggest question is his grades, which could stand improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Loya (Fontana, offensive lineman) -- For sheer power and determination, 
you will not find a more dominating lineman than the 6-3 and 280 Loya. Said 
Lemming's report, "Robert is a fierce competitor who is known for knocking 
defenders on their backside." Regarded by many scouts as the state's best 
offensive lineman, he has quick feet with a 5.0 clocking in the 40. He has a 
dead lift of 565 pounds. He is also solid academically with a 3.6 grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Clay Hattabaugh (Fontana, offensive lineman) -- With major-college prospects 
such as Loya and Hattabaugh on the same line, it is no wonder why big things 
are expected from Fontana again this season. At 6-3 and 265, Hattabaugh is 
slightly smaller than Loya but a little faster with a 4.9 time in the 40. He 
also has tremendous strength, having bench pressed 375 pounds. He moves well 
off a block and is especially strong as a run-blocker. A tackle in high school, 
he could move to guard for college. 
</P>
<P>
John DiSante (Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, offensive lineman) -- In a blue-chip 
year for offensive linemen in the state, DiSante rates among the best. He has 
the size (6-4, 270 pounds) and above-average foot speed with a time of 5.0 in 
the 40. He is a good all-around athlete who also plays nose guard. He also 
competes in basketball and track and field. He receives high marks for his 
aggressiveness but what scouts like most about him is his intense work ethic. 
He is also a good student with a 3.5 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan Roy (Van Nuys Montclair Prep, offensive lineman) -- Roy certainly has 
the size colleges like (6-6, 280 pounds). He also has outstanding quickness 
with a 5.0 in the 40 and ample strength having lifted 470 pounds in the squat. 
Particularly strong as a run-blocker on offense, he is also an imposing force 
as a tackle on defense, having batted down six passes in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cardona (La Mirada, offensive lineman) -- Another huge tackle who can play 
offense and defense, the 6-4 and 280-pound Cardona is not the fastest lineman 
among the Terrific 22 with a 5.4 clocking in the 40, but he makes up for any 
shortcomings with his aggressiveness and solid work habits. "He can pull, trap 
and makes very few mistakes at offensive tackle," said the Lemming report. He 
also stands out on defense, having recorded eight quarterback sacks in 10 games 
in earning All-Southern Section honors last season. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Greeley (Riverside La Sierra, offensive lineman) -- There are four 
players from the Inland Empire on the Terrific 22 and all are sizable offensive 
linemen. Greeley fits the description with his 6-3 and 275-pound frame. He has 
excelled at tackle on offense and defense. He is one of the quickest linemen on 
the list with a 4.9 time in the 40 and can bench press 360 pounds. His brother, 
Keith, plays basketball for USC. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hogue (El Toro, defensive lineman) -- The talent supply at El Toro never 
seems to be lacking and Hogue is another standout for one of the top programs 
in the Southland. At 6-4 and 255 pounds, he plays offense and defense. Scouts 
think his future is at defensive tackle. He has good speed with a 5.0 time in 
the 40, which probably helped him accumulate 12 quarterback sacks last season. 
Hogue also plays tackle on offense but prefers defense. He is also an 
exceptional student with a 4.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Balian (LaVerne Damien, defensive lineman) -- Damien always seems to 
produce at least one major-college prospect on the line and Balian is the 
latest. A 6-4 and 250-pound nose guard, Balian has the quickness and strength 
that enable him to control the line of scrimmage. He has a best of 4.9 seconds 
in the 40 and can bench press 420 pounds. Mostly a defensive player, he has 
even played a fullback on offense. He is also an outstanding wrestler, which 
might help to account for his excellent lateral mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Gilmour (Temple City, defensive lineman) -- He is not the biggest lineman 
in the state and that is one reason why Gilmour might eventually play outside 
linebacker in college. Scouts like his potential. At 6-5 and 220-pounds, he has 
above-average 4.8 speed in the 40 and a lot of room to fill out. "Matt is a 
quick-footed youngster who explodes off the ball," the Lemming report said. He 
also plays tight end on offense and averaged 10 points as forward for the 
basketball team last season. 
</P>
<P>
Clayvand Thomas (Carson, defensive back) -- On the field, there is little doubt 
about the ability of Thomas. Regarded by most scouts as one of the premier 
defensive backs in the state, the 6-0 and 175 Thomas returned three 
interceptions for touchdowns last season. He is especially adept at man-to-man 
coverage. But there are lingering questions about his physical condition after 
he broke a knee cap and wrist in an auto accident earlier this year. That is 
expected to keep him out of action until sometime in October. He has also 
incurred his share of disciplinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Stewart (Granada Hills High, defensive back) -- At first glance, it 
might be a little surprising that Stewart is considered among the top 
prospects. After all, he didn't produce a lot of impressive statistics as a 
junior, but there are a lot of things scouts like about the 5-11 and 185-pound 
Stewart. "He reacts well to the ball and he hits like a ton," one report said. 
While he didn't have any interceptions as a junior, he did have six quarterback 
sacks and plays with a lot of emotion. He also plays basketball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Ross (Simi Valley Royal, defensive back) -- It is unusual for Royal, a 
school that has never been a CIF Southern Section power, to have a blue-chip 
prospect, but Ross is an exception. The 6-4 and 205-pound Ross is one of the 
most versatile players on the Terrific 22. He plays strong safety and 
intercepted four passes last year, but could develop into an outside linebacker 
in college. He will also see time at tight end and wide receiver for Royal. 
Ross runs the 40 in 4.6 seconds, has leaped 6-7 in the high jump and plays 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Reser (Muir, defensive back) -- Reser, at 5-10 and 175 pounds, is not 
the biggest defensive back around, but he makes up for any size deficiency with 
his 4.5 speed in the 40. He is also a vicious hitter. "He's the hit man you 
want for your secondary who is athletic enough to play corner, too," SuperPrep 
said. Recruiters call him a pure college cornerback. He had four interceptions 
and forced three fumbles as a junior. He will also play running back this 
season.

R.P.V. HOPES TO STOP LANDSLIDE FOR GOOD; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: CITY WANTS TO ISSUE $10 MILLION IN REVENUE BONDS TO FUND 
ABATEMENT PROJECTS IN THE PORTUGUESE BEND AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1987, Mike Biele bought the ultimate fixer-upper in the Portuguese Bend area 
of Rancho Palos Verdes -- a modest ranch-style house with a foundation that had 
been severely undermined by a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
For a year and half, the 33-year-old window salesman worked on the house before 
moving in, elevating it three feet off the ground on steel beams and installing 
a system to keep the house level if the earth below it should move again. 
</P>
<P>
He has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"You really can't find anything around here comparable for a million bucks," 
said Biele, who declined to say how much he had paid for the house. "I've got 
an ocean view, half an acre, horse property, and I can only see one house from 
mine when I look out." 
</P>
<P>
Biele is one of dozens of residents in the area who live in homes that were 
damaged in the 1970s and early '80s by the Abalone Cove landslide -- a slide 
that city officials say has now stabilized as a result of various abatement 
efforts, including the installation of wells that suck water out of the 
unstable ground. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment agency, with the backing of Biele and some of the 
other residents, is now pursuing a plan that calls for $10 million in revenue 
bonds to be issued to pay for a host of other abatement projects. The goal is 
to stop the slide once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bonds would be guaranteed by hefty liens placed on each property 
owner in the slide area, many city officials and residents say they are 
confident that property owners will not be out any money. Under the plan, the 
bonds will be paid off through property tax increases generated as properties 
are resold in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But a vocal group of Abalone Cove residents is denouncing the plan, saying 
homeowners could be stuck paying off liens that in some instances will amount 
to tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
They also contend that the liens will make it difficult for owners to sell 
their properties and that the city is abusing the state's redevelopment law, 
which was designed to tackle urban blight. 
</P>
<P>
"I think very few of us want this kind of assessment against our property," 
said Jack Downhill, who owns just under eight acres in the slide area. He said 
he has calculated his lien, which would be based on the size of his property as 
well as on the structures he has built on it, at $88,000. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to issue the bonds came about because of a lawsuit brought against 
Los Angeles County and Rancho Palos Verdes by a group of property owners in the 
slide area. The 48 owners had alleged that excessive water runoff in the area 
caused the landslide. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a $3.6-million settlement reached in October, 1987, the county 
agreed to issue the bonds and defer payments for 10 years. Last Tuesday, the 
Board of Supervisors voted to hold a public hearing Nov. 29 in downtown Los 
Angeles to take public testimony on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes officials say the proposal calls for liens to be levied on 
about 105 property owners within an area of about 724 acres. The area is 
roughly bounded by Portuguese Canyon on the east, Sea Cove Drive extending 
north to Crest Road on the west, Abalone Cove Beach on the south and to the 
ridgeline below Crest Road on the north. 
</P>
<P>
When any property is sold and the assessed value is adjusted upward to reflect 
its current market value, the redevelopment agency will receive the additional 
property taxes generated to pay off the bonds, city officials said. The agency 
will also collect the additional property taxes generated by sales within 
another 275 acres included in the agency's jurisdiction, but no liens will be 
placed against those properties, which are outside the area of the Abalone Cove 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Griffin, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the county and city 
and a staunch supporter of the bond proposal, said the liens placed against the 
Abalone Cove property owners will probably mean that anyone selling property 
will have to deduct the lien amount from his sale price. 
</P>
<P>
But Griffin said he is convinced that the additional property taxes generated 
by sales will pay off the bonds. He estimated that the typical property tax 
bill for residents, many of whom have lived in the area for years, is $500 
annually. A home damaged by the slide and not yet repaired recently sold for 
more than $500,000, he said. Under Proposition 13, the house would be assessed 
at approximately 1% of its appraisal, so the tax would be $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tremendous boost" in property tax revenues, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said that, based on studies done by the city, she 
also believes the bonds can be repaid with property tax revenues. "We have gone 
through those numbers over and over and over again," she said. "The only 
mistake we have found is that we have been too conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Bacharach also said she does not believe the city is abusing redevelopment law, 
which was designed to identify blighted areas that could not be improved 
without government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't get improved without some government assistance," she said of the 
landslide area. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the revenue bond plan disagree. An informal group called Friends of 
the Bend has filed a lawsuit against the city, arguing that the city should 
never have been allowed to form a redevelopment zone because the area selected 
is largely undeveloped, open space. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the right area for redevelopment here and they should not have 
redevelopment here," said Alyce Snell, who has lived in the Abalone Cove area 
about 15 years. "This is not a slum area." 
</P>
<P>
Snell said the group is appealing a Superior Court decision handed down about 
three months ago that upheld the city's view that the slide area is appropriate 
for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the bond plan say that for years they have contributed to an 
assessment district formed to pay for the dewatering wells and other 
stabilization work. They also contend that it is unfair to force homeowners who 
were not plaintiffs in the lawsuit settled in 1987 to abide by its terms, which 
include the bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us were not part of the lawsuit," Snell said. "When we tried to get 
into the lawsuit, we were told it was closed and (we) could not get in. And yet 
our lives are being governed by the lawsuit. . . . It is taxation without 
representation." 
</P>
<P>
But it is the idea of having liens placed against their properties -- and the 
possibility that they may have to pay off the lien -- that appears to most 
anger critics of the bond plan. To add insult to injury, owners of vacant 
property who will have liens levied against them are prohibited from building 
in the Abalone Cove area because of a city moratorium imposed after the 
landslide. 
</P>
<P>
"They're being assessed for benefits that they will never receive," Downhill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the plan say that if the work that will be paid for by the bonds 
stabilizes the slide once and for all, property values should increase. Indeed, 
Biele said he is willing to take the risk that he may have to ante up $30,000 
-- the amount he calculates his lien would be. 
</P>
<P>
"If they do this stuff and the slide stops, is it worth $30,000?" he asked. "Of 
course it is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

$10 million in proposed revenue bonds.

Baseball Diamond to Be Scaled Down After Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley Recreation and Park District has decided to scale down a 
diamond at Fiore Field to protect neighboring residents from baseball 
bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials unanimously decided to reduce the size of one diamond, a 
300-foot field, to between 120 and 140 feet, park board Chairman Mike Berger 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The diamond will now be able to handle games for handicapped Little League 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors living next to the field have complained that baseball players hit 
balls over a 20-foot fence into their yards. 
</P>
<P>
To make up for the loss of a larger diamond for older youths, the size of a 
nearby field at Waverly Park has been increased to handle older Little League 
players, General Manager Tex Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
A second baseball diamond that has also caused problems will be monitored 
closely by the park district to see if there are continuing complaints, Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we've corrected the vast majority of the problems," Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
The $65,000 project also includes adding parking, creating areas for pitching 
warm-ups and batting cages as well as setting up picnic grounds and a 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
The area Little League has agreed to contribute $10,000 to the project. PSYCHE

TELL TV TIMES: HOW FAR SHOULD TV GO ? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new television season already has its share of controversy as several shows 
are using frank language in characters' dialogue. Among the shows in the 
spotlight are "Uncle Buck" (in the premiere young Sara Martineck, below left, 
says "you suck") and "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" (Sharon Gless says "tits"). 
Producers say such language is needed to keep the shows realistic. The networks 
argue that with freer-wheeling Fox and cable across the dial their shows must 
attract audiences. What do you think? Does such language really add to a show? 
Are euphemisms better? Send responses to Tell TV Times, TV Times, Times Mirror 
Square, Los Angeles, Calif., 90053. Or fax them to (213) 237-7630. Letters must 
be signed with full name and address. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the responses to the Aug. 26 question: What favorites would you like 
to see again? 
</P>
<P>
I would be happy if some station brought back "The Bronx Zoo" with Ed Asner. 
This was a terrific show, and NBC never gave it a decent chance. Instead, the 
network now gives us "Hull High." No taste, these people! 
</P>
<P>
Meridith Patera, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
1) "The Partridge Family": I know that KCAL had it on for a while, but I would 
love to see it on some other station's schedule again. 
</P>
<P>
2) "The Odd Couple," which used to air on KTLA. 
</P>
<P>
3) "Chico and the Man": KTTV used to show it, but then it was discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
4) "Hill Street Blues": Will this show be back on the air? I was informed by 
KCOP that another station had bought it. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Legas, Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
"Hill Street Blues" is airing weeknights at 7 p.m. on KTTY in San Diego. WGN 
cable also has syndication rights to the program until 1995, though it's not 
carrying the MTM police series currently. 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorite shows of the past was "Bewitched" with Elizabeth Montgomery 
and Dick York. With the world in its present state, we could use some laughs, 
magic and levitation. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Traxler, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
You'll find "Bewitched" Sundays at 1 a.m. on KCOP and weeknights at 8:30 p.m. 
on Nickelodeon. And for early birds, TBS carries it weekdays at 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
I would suggest "The Waltons." I don't recall any station running this series 
since it ended, apart from a two-hour episode occasionally shown as an 
afternoon movie. I would enjoy seeing all the episodes. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Denning, El Toro 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to see "Thriller" (the early 1960s suspense series with Boris 
Karloff), "One Step Beyond" (the syndicated title for "Alcoa Presents," 
1959-1961, an occult anthology) and "The Night Stalker" with Darren McGavin. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Jackson, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see "The Addams Family," "My Favorite Martian" and "Dave Allen 
at Large," which featured the Irish comedian/talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
Charles J. Meyer, Sherman Oaks 
</P>
<P>
TNT carries "My Favorite Martian" weekdays at 6:30 a.m.

BOB AND SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Dad, why don't you sit down for a minute. Is there anything you need? You 
thirsty?" Chris Elliott turned to a stage hand on the set. "We don't need my 
dad for this next scene do we?" Then back to his dad, "Why don't you take a 
break upstairs?" 
</P>
<P>
Elliott spoke gently with his arm on the shoulder of his father, Bob, who was 
dressed in a plaid robe-regular garb for his paternal role on his son's new Fox 
sitcom "Get a Life!" The elder Elliott had a slightly bemused expression on his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go upstairs and sit on that couch in these pajamas I just fall asleep," 
he said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in the privacy of a dressing room, Bob Elliott, 67, smiled slightly when 
asked about his son's overactive concern for his well being. "Chris looks out 
for me on the set," Elliott said, shaking his head. "He does. He does. More 
than he needs to." He laughed. "You know, I've been around for a long time. I 
fend for myself pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
How long has Elliott been around? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I've done 'The Tonight Show' with every host that 'The Tonight Show' has 
ever had." 
</P>
<P>
That Elliott wants to bring his warmhearted comedy to yet another generation of 
TV audiences with "Get a Life!" is a tribute to his courage. On March 23, Ray 
Goulding, Elliott's partner and friend for four decades, died of kidney failure 
at his home in Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
The death permanently split up Bob and Ray, the gentle giants of radio comedy. 
They were a national, always natural, broadcasting sensation who poked fun at 
themselves and America, reaching their peak during the golden days of radio and 
the birth of television. 
</P>
<P>
"God, the stories that came out (after Goulding's death)," Elliott said in his 
unwavering trademark delivery. His deep, soulful eyes were unblinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a second coming. I didn't know so much was thought of us. I don't 
think we ever thought people put that much importance in what we did. It was a 
bittersweet acceptance. I'm sorry Ray didn't live to see it. He had to go to 
have that come out." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott and Goulding first met in 1946 as returning World War II veterans at a 
Boston radio station, where Elliott was a deejay and Goulding a newscaster. 
After his newscasts, Goulding would stick around in the booth and "just kibitz 
back and forth on the air," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years they created a wacky cast of on-air characters, did 
rope tricks, spoke lyrics to songs while accompanied only by drums and hawked 
items such as "The Bob and Ray Home Surgery Kit" -- asking viewers, "How many 
times have you said to yourself, 'Golly, I wish I could take out my tonsils'?" 
</P>
<P>
They played target practice on air, flinging their humor like well-placed 
darts. "The Gathering Dusk," a Bob and Ray takeoff on an early radio serial, 
was a "heartwarming story of a girl who found unhappiness by leaving no stone 
unturned in her efforts to locate it," and was sponsored by "the Whippet Motor 
Car Co., observing the 45th anniversary of its disappearance." 
</P>
<P>
In 1952 the New York Herald Tribune wrote of their act: "It is a mixture of 
satire, nonsense and whimsy. It sometimes has a waspish sting, raising 
uncomfortable welts on various cows sacred to the broadcasting and advertising 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
Their good humor eventually brought Bob and Ray to a national audience. They 
played in nearly every time slot on the NBC, ABC and Mutual Broadcasting System 
radio and television networks. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling their time on television, Elliott said, "TV in the '50s was so much 
more fun than this." He gestured to the "Get a Life!" set outside. "Because the 
pressure wasn't there. You can't believe how loose it was. When we did a live, 
15-minute TV show, that was literally done from a blackboard. We'd write down 
four topics, talk them out and then ad lib those. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound-effects men were free enough so they would toss in a sound that 
might throw us on air, and very often did. But it made it fun. Now you don't 
dare cough on a show because it's not written into the script." 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Bob and Ray appeared on Broadway-and a later tour-in their own show, 
"The Two and Only." During the '70s they broadcast their radio show from WWOR 
in New York, and reunited their wacky cast of characters in 1984 for National 
Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago Goulding grew ill and the two stopped working together. Elliott 
said he missed his partner at his side. "I did terribly, for I'd say, almost 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I really was kind of grasping. I didn't know what I wanted to do." He paused. 
"I really didn't want to stop working. But I didn't see where I was going to 
work. And it's, uh" -- Elliott took a slow, deep breath-"well, providence has 
been kind to me." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, because offers kept rolling in for Elliott as a solo act. He played Bob 
Newhart's dad in an episode of "Newhart." Bill Murray offered Elliott a role as 
an agreeable bank security guard in the summer film "Quick Change." And 
Garrison Keillor recruited him into his American Radio Company on NPR. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be ready to retire and go to Maine, and then something would come along 
like manna from heaven. So I'd say, well, we'll stay a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
And now, Bob Elliott has found a new comedy partner-his son Chris. 
</P>
<P>
"I take pride in the fact that he has a show," Elliott said. Like his son, 
Elliott began his career as a page at NBC, which he used to get into 
broadcasting and build a cult following. "I mean, I should be the best prepared 
to do a team operation of anybody around, especially with my son." DANIEL

ARSON: FIRE-SETTERS RANGE FROM ABUSED CHILDREN TO PROFESSIONAL "TORCHES." NOW, 
EXPERTS ARE COMPILING COMPUTER PROFILES OF THOSE WHO COMMIT SUCH CRIMES.

<P>
It's been called the coward's crime, one of the most underreported in the 
country, and one of the least understood. Its practitioners include the 
mentally unstable, little children and hired professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The tools are everywhere -- cigarette lighters, matches, newspapers, many 
household products. The crime is arson, and it requires no planning. 
</P>
<P>
The power of fire is also the most power some of these people will ever 
possess. 
</P>
<P>
But who is this arsonist? 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of guy who likes to walk in the misty rain," said John 
Barracato, chief investigator for Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, a man who has 
interviewed 900 arsonists in a 32-year career. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as the generic arsonist," said David J. Icove, the 
FBI's top arson investigator who, along with the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms 
and Tobacco, is creating profiles on a computer that may help local law 
enforcement agencies find arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
Arson kills 1,000 people a year in this country, injures an additional 10,000 
and costs the American public $10 billion to $20 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In April, a ferry from Norway to Denmark, the Scandinavian Star, caught 
fire and 158 lost their lives. Police called it arson but made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Puerto Rico, the Dupont Plaza hotel burned on New Year's Eve and 97 were 
killed at the dawn of the year 1987. Three disgruntled kitchen workers were 
convicted of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last Christmas eve, an arson fire raged through Westwood's posh condominium 
row, igniting 15 buildings, chasing 150 people from their homes and inflicting 
$25 million in damage. No one has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The crime of arson has fascinated psychiatrists and criminologists for years. 
Even Sigmund Freud wrote a paper on the arsonist in the early '30s. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons is that there are different types of arsonists, and although 
some overlap, the motive for the arson somewhat determines the profile. Why 
does the person set the fire? Is it a rational act or is it a compulsion? Is it 
a business operation with cold cash on the line or is it revenge? 
</P>
<P>
Is there immediate of delayed sexual gratification as the flames leap? Is there 
a feeling of anger or just power as the individual stands in a crowd watching 
the destruction that he has wrought? 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials have created six or seven categories of arsonists, with the two 
extremes being the true pyromaniac and the top-of-the-line hired "torch." 
Although accounting for a small percentage of arson, psychologically these two 
are the farthest apart. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the reported cases of arson in the country are the work of juveniles, 
ranging from children playing with matches to teen-agers looking for thrills. 
In reality, they probably account for many more. Parents frequently put out the 
fires before they get out of hand and don't call the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
For very young children, it is often a cry for help -- or an accident. Older 
juveniles often set fires for excitement. The hard question is whether they 
will outgrow it. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Cole of the University of Rochester and a private consultant has 
studied the problem extensively. He believes that the label "arsonist" should 
not be used too freely with some of these youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
He stresses that most juveniles who set fires have no serious or emotional 
handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
"the problem is that we should not start going around labeling any child who 
had made a fire as a potential sociopath, or even a potential criminal," Cole 
said. "A lot of it is curiosity fire-setting and some of it is plain 
old-fashioned vandalism, but I don't think this is a different kid than the kid 
who breaks windows, or soaps windows or knocks down stop signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe one-third of them may have serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
According to one study, 85% of the victims of fires set by children are the 
children themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Easy access to matches, cigarette lighters, candles and stoves killed 69 
children in the last three years in New York. Nationwide, burns are second only 
to transportation accidents as the cause of death during childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no generic arsonist, there are certain characteristics that 
keep cropping up. 
</P>
<P>
It is generally accepted that arson is predominantly a male crime. The arsonist 
is usually not well educated. One study showed an average ninth-grade 
education. He is often mentally deficient or possessing below-average 
intelligence. He comes from an unstable home where he may have been abused. He 
is usually short and slight. He is usually divorced or has never been married, 
has poor relations with others, particularly with women, and probably has a 
menial job. He may be known already to the local police and has little or no 
self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
He is, in a word, a loser. 
</P>
<P>
The professional "torch" is the smartest of the arsonists and tends to come 
from a higher socioeconomic background. He makes relatively big bucks burning 
buildings to collect the insurance. His counterpart, the "thug torch," is not 
nearly as good, but far cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
"They hire a stiff from the local bar and give him $150 to $500. I know of one 
buy who got $1,000," said Barracato, a New York City deputy fire marshal before 
he joined Aetna. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy you hire at the bar is probably a low-level criminal type, maybe with 
a drug or alcohol problem, not well-educated, and probably already familiar to 
the police." 
</P>
<P>
His counterpart, the pro, is smarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to see the paper that shows the face value of the property," 
Barracato said. "He'll take 10%, half up front, and guarantee the job will be 
done in three weeks. By the time the fire department gets there, he's at the 
airport. We don't get many of them. They fly in and out of town and don't leave 
tracks." 
</P>
<P>
The real pro tends to be older, in his late 20s to early 50s. He often is a 
heavy drinker, but unlike some arsonists who need alcohol to give them courage 
to start the fire, the pro is likely to be stone sober when he enters a 
building to take it down. 
</P>
<P>
He is probably a fairly nocturnal individual, possibly nomadic, likely to be 
single or divorced. 
</P>
<P>
Another type well known to the firefighting world is the "vanity" or "hero" 
fire maker. He might be the security guard whose job is threatened. So he 
starts a fire one night, calls the fire department, but manages to subdue it 
himself before the firemen arrive. 
</P>
<P>
What happens? His job is safe. He might even get a promotion or a raise. He 
also will go right up to No. 1 on the fire marshal's suspect list. 
</P>
<P>
He may also be a superintendent of a building who has put out one too many 
fires for the investigators' antennae. Although he may appear a hero, Fire 
Marshal James McSwigin says he sometimes tries to become too big a hero and 
ends up killing himself and others. 
</P>
<P>
The federal study will be released in about 18 months, Icove said. It will be 
based on in-depth interviews with 100 serial arsonists convicted of setting 
three or more fires and imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
It is notoriously easy to get away with arson -- only 16 arrests for every 100 
confirmed incendiary fires, contrasted with 75 arrests per 100 homicides. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance officials say half of all residential fires are arson, but charges 
are brought in only 19% to 26% of the cases. They can't prove it. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI study found that women turn up in significant numbers only in the 
revenge-motivated category. Twenty-eight percent of the arsonists in this 
category are women; the category itself makes up only 14% of all arsons. 
</P>
<P>
Another finding was that juvenile vandals and thrill-seekers tended to act in 
groups, not as loners. Juveniles also said they did not use alcohol or drugs 
before setting fires. Many adults said they did. 
</P>
<P>
New York City Chief Fire Marshal John Stickevers has prepared a paper on the 
true pyromaniac. He says the disorder is an extreme form of 
obsessive-compulsive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Stickevers says pyromaniacs usually follow rather rigid patterns, starting 
fires when and where no one is likely to be around. The fires also tend to 
occur in geographic clusters. 
</P>
<P>
The pyromaniac, he says, is often a male loner whose background includes a 
domineering mother and a weak or absent father. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the principal male figure in his life probably worked at a job in 
which fire played a significant role, such as a firefighter, steel mill worker 
or incinerator operator. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who is obsessed with fire is probably a pyromaniac," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
The few female pyromaniacs become active at menopause, while the men start out 
as youngsters. The female pyros typically set a number of small fires inside 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some arsonists are simply starting the fire to conceal other crimes, such as a 
murder, burglary, or even industrial espionage. 
</P>
<P>
John Hall, director of fire analysis and research at the National Fire 
Protection Assn. in Quincy, Mass., says there is no hard data, but he would 
guess that 14% to 20% of arsonists have severe psychological problems. His 
organization has been keeping statistics on arson for nearly 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot we don't know," Hall said. "I would be very suspicious of 
anyone going around making a living giving a profile of an arsonist." 
</P>
<P>
Barracato agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the most misunderstood of all crimes," he said. "We understand very 
little of the pathology and nobody is keeping accurate records."

DESPERATE CRIME LEAVES EMBERS OF GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY BARTLETT , ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martha B. is an arsonist, one who got away with it, but the memory still haunts 
her. 
</P>
<P>
With three sons and an infant daughter, she was abandoned by her husband and on 
the brink of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
She could not keep up the mortgage payments on her home in the Northeast. As a 
woman without marketable skills, she couldn't support her youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
So she decided to burn the house, collect the insurance money and move to the 
Carolinas, where, she was told, houses were far less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
She worried about getting caught and going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I was like a detective, only planning backwards," Martha said, speaking on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
She used combustible household materials, ignited by a stove and helped along 
by a stack of newspapers from her son's paper route. 
</P>
<P>
Martha worried also about the psychological effect the fire would have on the 
children. She felt they were already victimized by the father's abandonment and 
wondered whether this would further erode their self-esteem. She decided to 
take a big chance and make the two older boys co-conspirators. 
</P>
<P>
She explained that Mommy would go to jail if they ever breathed a word about 
it. And she delivered the grim news that they would lose their clothes, their 
favorite toys, their prized possessions. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest son balked. He was a good athlete and had Little League and other 
trophies, framed photographs of his teams. He didn't want to lose them. Martha 
compromised. Each child, she decided, could choose and save one item. 
</P>
<P>
"He is still resentful about losing those things," she said. "I don't think 
things have ever been the same between us." 
</P>
<P>
The night of the fire, Martha took the children to a fast-food restaurant where 
they were known, then took the boys bowling -- providing a number of witnesses 
for their alibi. 
</P>
<P>
The children were coached to cry and to act surprised when they returned home. 
They proved to be good little actors. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned from bowling and pulled up to the crowded fire scene, a 
fireman told her it was the house next door, not hers. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, thank God!" she said with enough conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The other factor in her favor was that her house was underinsured. Still, she 
felt she was a suspect for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day I wasn't allowed in, and I walked around the house and I broke 
into real tears, not fake tears," she recalls. "I lost a lot, but I felt I had 
no choice. It was still hard, losing photographs of the children, wedding gifts 
and little things I treasured, but I knew I couldn't take them out first. 
</P>
<P>
Martha has remarried and has moved back to the Northeast, but her conscience 
has never been soothed. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time something bad happens in my life, I feel it is my punishment for 
starting that fire. Still, I think if I were in that same situation today, I 
would do the same thing."

STREET VENDORS FINDING IT HARDER TO PLY THEIR WARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZAN SCHILL, Suzan Schill is a free-lance writer in the Southeast area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Street vendors in the Southeast area are finding it increasingly difficult to 
sell their wares because of tougher city ordinances and police crackdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Bellflower passed an ordinance June 11 that bars all street vending, after a 
sharp increase in the city of door-to-door pillow salesmen and Popsicle hawkers 
on bicycles. There are exceptions to the ordinance for licensed catering 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very important to limit the street sellers," said Mike Egan, assistant 
city administrator. "The reason we took these steps is because they were coming 
in from all around. Somehow the word had gotten out that they could come in 
here and sell out of their carts, and there was a concern about health 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Code enforcement officials warn a vendor to get out of town the first time 
spotted and cite the vendor the second time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 27, South Gate passed an ordinance that prohibits street vending from 
non-motorized vehicles. The city's 47 licensed truck vendors are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council cited unclean food handling and children running into streets 
to buy Popsicles as reasons to quickly pass the urgency ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand people are trying to make a buck, but there are health and safety 
considerations," Chief of Police Ron George said. 
</P>
<P>
During three weeks in August, South Gate police impounded 31 pushcarts and 
issued citations, said Lt. Michael Blaska, watch commander. The carts are 
picked up by the city's contract towing service. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually bring in about three a week," said Sharon Shipe, dispatcher for 
Walt's Tow Service. "They're usually empty because the vendor takes his goods 
out of the cart or the cop will give the snow cones to the kids on the block." 
</P>
<P>
Although vendors see selling on the streets as a way to survive, most city 
officials see them as a nuisance and are passing ordinances to outlaw the use 
of public streets for selling anything. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, Norwalk, Cerritos, Lakewood, Hawaiian Gardens, Downey, Pico Rivera 
and Signal Hill for years have had ordinances forbidding the use of public 
streets by hawkers. 
</P>
<P>
In most cities that have prohibited street vending, the vendor will be cited 
and, if convicted, subject to a fine of up to $500 or a six-month jail term. 
The typical punishment is a fine of $100 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier allows street vending, provided the seller has a city-issued business 
license. The vendor, who is usually directed to the business license offices by 
police officers, must pay a $30 fee for fingerprinting and photos. If the 
vendor has no criminal record, he can pay $50 more and be issued an annual 
business license, said Bob Lyons, business license officer. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier has 10 to 12 licensed vendors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some street vendors are not aware of the laws because they have recently 
arrived from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these vendors come directly from San Salvador and Ecuador and are 
caught completely off guard when we issue them a citation and confiscate their 
carts," Montebello Police Chief Steve Simonian said. 
</P>
<P>
Montebello passed an ordinance a year ago to allow the city to confiscate carts 
and their contents. Carts are confiscated daily by the patrol division and code 
enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're violated every day by street vendors," Simonian said. "Most of them are 
undocumented aliens. I think most of them know it's illegal to be peddling, but 
for many of them, it's the only way they have to make money. The instinct for 
survival is very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Many understand the risks and are constantly changing locations, setting up for 
a few hours, then moving on. 
</P>
<P>
"I make $20 to $40 a day, barely enough for food and rent," said Ricardo Guiroz 
Franco, a native of Mexico. He paid a coyote, a transporter of illegal aliens, 
$300 to bring him safely across the Mexican-American border five months ago. 
The owner of the cart lets him sleep on the floor of his home. Guiroz Franco 
sends what money he can home to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Street selling is a way of life in Mexico," said Benjamin Bernard, a Bell 
Gardens resident originally from Mexico City. "It's normal there; no problem 
for the seller, no problem for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
At the corner of Florence and Pacific avenues in Huntington Park, Jaan Zanches, 
formerly of Jalisco, Mexico, does a brisk seasonal business selling carved 
mangoes from an improvised stand made from three plastic milk crates. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, Jorge Torrez sells Spanish cassette tapes laid out on a sheet, 
hidden from the street by a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only work I can find," he said. "I make a little money to pay the 
rent and buy some food." 
</P>
<P>
Torrez, who walked across the Mexican-American border with friends, has been in 
this country for five months. 
</P>
<P>
In early September, the Latino Chamber of Commerce asked Compton to allow shop 
owners to display goods on private property. The proposal was turned down, 
partly because, council members said, if they allowed outside displays, they 
would be inviting the street vendors back. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, we don't have that problem," Police Cmdr. Ramon Allen said about 
vendors. "We used a special enforcement team to run the street vendors out into 
the unincorporated Los Angeles County zones a year or so ago." 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Park, the crackdown took another form: In June the city 
confiscated 32 coconuts, 85 watermelons, 120 mangoes, 743 bags of pork rinds, 8 
bags of oranges, 53 churros and 72 bags of spiced fruit from street vendors who 
could not produce a driver's license or California identification card. If a 
vendor can provide acceptable identification, he is issued a citation, with no 
confiscation. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what they did with all the confiscated goods, Rudy Munoz, Huntington 
Park's assistant redevelopment director said: "The food goes bad, and we have 
to dispose of it."

HOSPITAL TAKES HEART FROM NEW UNIT'S SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE BUSINESS OF CARDIAC CARE IS BOOMING AT DOWNEY COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. 
THIS YEAR, 355 ANGIOPLASTIES AND CARDIAC SURGERIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED, AN 8.8% 
RISE OVER '89.

<P>
Cardiologist Winfried Waider maneuvered the guide wire through a main artery to 
the blockage that caused his patient severe chest pain by restricting the flow 
of blood to her heart. 
</P>
<P>
One, two, three, four times the tiny balloon was inflated, smashing down years 
of plaque buildup and blood that had clotted in the artery. 
</P>
<P>
The angioplasty cleared the artery and, minutes later, another patient was 
rolled into the high-tech lab at Downey Community Hospital for an exploratory 
heart procedure. Three more patients would follow before the workday ended. 
</P>
<P>
Business is booming at the hospital's Heart Center, which opened in the highly 
competitive Los Angeles area market just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 355 angioplasties and heart surgeries have taken place at the 
207-bed hospital, said the hospital's administrative director, Tom Lonergan. 
That represents an 8.8% increase over the number of angioplasties and heart 
surgeries performed in all of 1989. Cardiologists also performed 758 diagnostic 
catheterizations, an exploratory procedure in which a catheter is inserted and 
maneuvered through an artery to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd never thought we'd be doing the kinds of numbers we're doing now, in our 
wildest dreams," Lonergan said. 
</P>
<P>
The upstart heart program still has a way to go before it challenges the big 
boys: The Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles, for example, had 663 
angioplasties and 2,978 diagnostic catheterizations in 1988, to lead all 
hospitals in California, according to statistics published by the California 
Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
</P>
<P>
Downey Community ranked 83rd in the number of angioplasties performed that 
year, its first full year of operation and the latest year for which statewide 
statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that we'll ever have the volume that a Good Sam' has, but we have 
the potential of increasing our numbers and becoming a bigger player," Lonergan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The heart center has contributed to the rising income the nonprofit hospital 
has enjoyed in recent years, Lonergan said. The hospital netted $1.9 million 
during its 1988 fiscal year and $4.1 million in 1989, according to a hospital 
report. That figure is expected to reach $6.4 million for the 1990 fiscal year, 
which ended June 30, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>

The success of the heart-care program has drawn outside notice. Larry S. 
Stepnick, a spokesman for the Health Care Advisory Board, said: "Downey is in a 
very elite group of small, relatively 'unknown' hospitals which have been able 
to begin a successful cardiology program in the last few years, and perhaps the 
only one to do so in a market as competitive as that of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The Advisory Board, a Washington-based firm, performs studies each year to 
inform 450 hospitals across the nation about techniques that can increase 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey hospital will be profiled, along with others, in an Advisory Board 
study on cardiology programs. Stepnick said Downey Community offers "high 
quality at a competitive price." 
</P>
<P>
Heart care has become a plum business for hospitals that break into the market 
and run a successful program. Lonergan said heart care generally provides about 
17% of a hospital's gross revenues, but up to 50% of its profits. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing studies indicated that the Heart Center would be profitable, Lonergan 
said: "The community was really wanting it. You obviously would rather have 
major types of surgery performed in your community, with people you know, 
rather than travel long distances." 
</P>
<P>
Downey Community spent more than $6 million to build and equip its center, 
which opened Sept. 23, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to couple top-notch service with aggressive marketing, which 
included an eye-catching billboard along the Santa Ana Freeway that featured a 
16-foot-high latex heart that beat by means of motors and fans. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital had relied on a core group of eight cardiologists for advice on 
how best to outfit the center, Lonergan said. 
</P>
<P>
The lab, where the angioplasties are performed, was built next to the operating 
room so open-heart surgery can be performed quickly if complications develop. 
</P>
<P>
The lab is equipped with the most modern digital X-ray equipment, which has 
helped attract about 30 cardiologists and their patients to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"They provide us with what we want and need," said cardiologist Stephen N. 
Berberich, one of the doctors who helped plan the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Most standard cardiac procedures are performed at Downey Community, including 
bypass surgery and valve replacements. Hospital charges for an angioplasty 
start at about $3,500, while heart surgery carries a hospital fee of $12,000 
and up, a hospital spokeswoman said. Doctor fees, which vary widely, are 
additional. 
</P>
<P>
The heart center has a good success rate. The number of deaths of patients with 
heart problems is well within the expected range, according to the federal 
Health Care Financing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the mortality rate for patients with severe, chronic heart disease 
was 15.4% in 1988 at Downey Community. The predicted mortality range for the 
hospital's clientele, based on demographic factors, was 9.8% to 33.8%, 
according to an HCFA report. 
</P>
<P>
"Like anything in business, you have to have the quality to be successful," 
Lonergan said. "That's been our focus." 
</P>
<P>
Cardiologists at neighboring hospitals praised the heart program at Downey 
Community because it provides top-notch, standard heart care to the community. 
But they also noted the limits of the hospital's program. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Downey Community uses the time-tested angioplasty. The hospital 
does not perform atherectomies, which are several experimental procedures that 
remove plaque from arteries by scraping, drilling or pulverizing. Usually, such 
high-technology procedures are limited to research hospitals, such as Good 
Samaritan. 
</P>
<P>
An atherectomy was performed last month on Dan Reeves, coach of the National 
Football League's Denver Broncos, who had hardened arteries. It took place in 
Redwood City, San Mateo County. 
</P>
<P>
Downey Community is "a prototype for what a community hospital giving cardiac 
services should be like," said Dr. Stephen Oesterle, director of 
catheterization labs at Good Samaritan. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Messenger, director of the coronary care unit at Memorial Hospital 
Medical Center, Long Beach, has watched Downey's heart program grow for three 
years. His partner, cardiologist Waider, performs some of his angioplasties 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"They've taken some of our business away, but it's probably better for patients 
if they are closer to home," Messenger said.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The roughnecks are back working on Pier G in Long Beach Harbor. 
Grease-spattered workers last week were clearing gas and sand out of a well, 
which had been idle for years, so that it can pump oil again. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of several signs that the sagging oil industry in Long Beach is 
rebounding in response to soaring prices. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a barrel of California crude has doubled since the Aug. 2 Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials have reopened nearly 100 wells. State officials are 
planning to step up exploration of local oil fields. Independent operators -- 
recently considered a dying breed -- have started up idle wells and are 
scrambling to find qualified workers for their rigs. Some of these oilmen say 
their losing operations already have begun to show a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, higher prices could bring windfalls for everybody from the state down 
to more than 8,000 Long Beach property owners who have a stake in oil reserves 
3,500 feet below their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Soden, who receives a $17 royalty check every month for the oil under 
her Belmont Heights home, might see a modest increase of $10 or so. But state 
officials estimated that oil revenues from state tidelands in Long Beach could 
nearly double, to $180 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials say city oil revenues could jump from $5 million to $6.5 
million in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
That is, if prices stay high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very schizophrenic business, and it's hard to know what will happen," 
said Xenophon Colazas, director of the Long Beach Department of Oil Properties. 
"But right now, (the Persian Gulf crisis) is good news for Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The city is on top of one of the most productive petroleum patches in U.S. 
history, the Wilmington Oil Field. The 16-mile patch stretches from Seal Beach 
to Torrance and has yielded more than 2.3 billion barrels in the last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
A prospector struck black gold in the Long Beach area in 1921, when he drilled 
a hole into Signal Hill and discovered what is known today as the Long Beach 
Oil Field. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, a luckier prospector discovered the Wilmington Field when he stuck a 
drill into what now is a bed of begonias off Pacific Coast Highway on the west 
side of town. 
</P>
<P>
Oil money built Long Beach's mansions and huge harbor and propped up the city 
budget. A Saturday Evening Post story once called Long Beach "The Town With Too 
Much Money." 
</P>
<P>
By 1965, so much oil had been sucked from under Long Beach that its land sank 
up to 29 feet. And by the end of the decade, the city's revenues began sinking 
too. 
</P>
<P>
A flood of cheap oil from the Mideast, a state law requiring the city to turn 
over most oil profits to the state and a dwindling pool of easily accessible 
oil began to take their toll. 
</P>
<P>
Production of crude from the Long Beach tidelands in the Wilmington field 
dropped from a peak of about 164,000 barrels a day in 1969 to 57,600 barrels a 
day last year, according to Jim Trout, assistant executive officer of the State 
Lands Commission, the agency in charge of overseeing the state's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The 1964 state law funneled a growing share of tideland oil revenues to 
Sacramento, while reducing the city's share from a peak of $20 million a year 
to $1 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade alone, the city's total annual oil revenues from the 
tidelands and other fields fell from $15 million, to $5.5 million, according to 
city officials. And about a third of the city's 3,000 wells were capped, mainly 
because prices plunged so low that it no longer paid to tap them. 
</P>
<P>
The city scraped the bottom of the barrel in June, when the price of oil 
dropped to $10.63, Colazas said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John Shirey concurred: "To tell you the truth, we were 
very nervous we wouldn't meet the projections we had in our budget." 
</P>
<P>
But the price fetched by a barrel of local crude climbed to $24 last week, and 
city officials are positively gleeful. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sweating (because estimated projections) came in too high, so we sent 
Xen (Colazas) over to the Mideast, and he stirred things up," City Manager 
James Hankla said jokingly during last week's meeting of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said if prices stay at their current levels, the city can pump an 
extra $1.5 million in oil revenues into the general fund this year. That is a 
sliver of the city's $215 million in revenues, but as Hankla pointed out, it is 
enough to hire 15 more police officers. Or, more likely, he said, increase the 
city's anemic $750,000 reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, oilmen say, the increased prices could mean that it will become 
profitable again to drill for deeper reserves. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the city had predicted that its oil would run out by the year 
2011. But City Auditor Robert Fronke said if the price of a barrel stays high, 
it is "likely" that companies can afford to turn to more expensive ways of 
getting oil. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the state will install a $500,000 computer system in the Long Beach 
office of the State Lands Commission to collect information about the 
Wilmington field and help target sites for future exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Independent oil companies are also reopening wells and considering exploration 
that just a few months ago would have been inconceivable in the face of 
environmental opposition and the fickle market. 
</P>
<P>
Tidelands Oil Production Co. produces about 10,000 barrels a day from Long 
Beach Harbor. Its gross revenues jumped from $2.7 million in July to more than 
$5 million last month, General Manager Terry Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
So many oil workers -- known in the business as roustabouts and roughnecks and 
pushers -- left during the slump, Smith said, that his company is scrambling to 
find qualified people to fill new jobs on rigs. 
</P>
<P>
J.C. (Mac) McFarland runs a drilling company started by his father. He said 
revenues for the company, which owns about 40 wells in Long Beach, have 
increased by $25,000 a day in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
But he also has mixed feelings: His brother-in-law, who works for a military 
contractor, is being sent to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great for us," McFarland said, "but terrible for the country." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's 3,000 wells -- including those being reopened -- are along 
the city's shoreline and under the ocean floor. In 1964, after decades of 
bitter wrangling over who should get the money from this "tidelands" portion of 
the field, a state law made Long Beach trustee for the state's holdings, and 
the city became the first in the country to operate a major oil field. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Department of Oil Properties is the seventh-largest producer of oil 
in California, ahead of such companies as Exxon and Arco. The city administers 
a complicated patchwork of agreements with thousands of different operators and 
owners of these wells, who range from the state to individual property owners 
to about a dozen larger companies, such as Mobil and Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 other wells on dry land owned by the city, for which the 
city receives some type of royalty. The biggest concentration of these wells, 
some of which tap into smaller oil fields, flank Signal Hill. Pumps also 
operate in a fenced lot in Recreation Park, along Long Beach Marina and near 
Long Beach Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne (Bud) Eatmon, a supervisor in the city oil properties department, 
oversees the complex operations. Every day, Eatmon makes his rounds of the 
city's holdings, driving up and down desolate piers where metal arms pump up 
and down without stop, pushing oil through an underground pipe network that 
resembles spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
Some days, Eatmon heads out to the city's four drilling islands. Built in the 
1960s, the islands' rigs are camouflaged with siding and palm trees to resemble 
high-rise condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Eatmon's family moved from Oklahoma to Long Beach during the oil boom days, and 
he has been around long enough not to notice the sour smell of petroleum that 
hangs over the harbor. He talks about oil as if it were a living creature. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't clear the well," he said, "the oil begins to talk to you. It 
bubbles and comes to see you." 
</P>
<P>
Eatmon is one of several city and industry officials who predict that the price 
surge will not last: "The market is a yo-yo. I've been around long enough to 
see it go up and down many times. I don't get excited any more." 
</P>
<P>
Another skeptical old-timer in the department is Grover Cleveland (Slim) 
Chapman, who said much of the fun has been taken out of the industry with the 
decline of wildcatting. When asked whether the current upswing will last, 
Chapman grinned and said he is looking forward to retiring and doing some 
fly-fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jeffrey Kellogg can also be counted among the pessimists. "The 
industry is dying," said Kellogg, who recalled playing Little League baseball 
in a Signal Hill field surrounded by so many old wooden derricks that it 
resembled a "pincushion." 
</P>
<P>
About the only one of those derricks left, Kellogg said, is a decorative base 
in front of the Oil Patch Liquor Store. Kellogg's family drilling business 
closed in January. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have expressed concern, however, that the Persian Gulf crisis 
will lead to renewed attacks on regulations barring offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"Oil companies are going to try and use this to open up new exploration and 
drilling off the coast again," said Marshall Blesofsky, environmental 
co-chairman of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved. 
</P>
<P>
Oilman Dan Elliott agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, an independent producer whose company has about 16 wells in the Long 
Beach area, said that because of the high price of oil, he wants to drill a 
well in an unexplored portion of East Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty more oil under this city, Elliott said, but community 
opposition may prevent him from getting at it -- just as it forced him last 
year to pull down a rig that had been standing for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a problem with people who don't want drilling," he said. "But we can't 
go out to the Mojave Desert and look for oil. People are going to have to 
decide if it's more important to them to have drilling or to have their sons 
overseas to protect oil there."

LONG BEACH CITY OIL REVENUES 
</P>
<P>
Listed below are the approximate oil revenues to city and state from oil fields 
in Long Beach. The city can use its share of the money from the "tidelands," 
where it produces the oil as trustee for the state, only for its Harbor Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Money generated from wells not in the tidelands, on upland that the city has an 
interest in or owns, flows into the city's general fund.

SPOILS: The city of Long Beach, local oil men and the state stand to make some 
money off the Persian Gulf crisis as the price of oil doubles. The market is 
fickle, but city officials and private companies are reopening wells. Long 
Beach says its oil revenues could increase by $1.5 million. Worker Greg 
Sherman, above, has a sweeping view of this oil operation on Pier G, as 
reflected in his glasses. J1 ; Table, LONG BEACH CITY OIL REVENUES ; Map,

'OUT OF CONTROL' 
</P>
<P>
Frightening. Ugly. Embarrassing. They all describe a bench-clearing brawl that 
brought an early end to Friday night's non-league game between Hawthorne and 
visiting Eisenhower High of Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
The game, won by Eisenhower, 21-6, was called by officials with 4:59 remaining 
after players from both teams engaged in a free-swinging melee that was set off 
when Hawthorne's players left their bench and stormed the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw about 50 red jerseys running across the field totally out of control," 
Eisenhower Coach Tom Hoak said. "Their whole program is out of control." 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after Eisenhower had scored its third touchdown to take a 
15-point lead. Morell Ollis returned the kickoff, and several players began 
pushing and shoving near the Eisenhower sideline after the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
But what appeared to be a mild skirmish turned into a donnybrook when 
Hawthorne's players ran from their sideline. The brawl lasted about five 
minutes before coaches, officials and police could separate the combatants. 
Eisenhower remained on the field until the stadium was cleared. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Coach Goy Casillas said Saturday he would review films of the game 
before taking any possible disciplinary action against his players. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to blow it out of proportion," Casillas said. "It was a hotly 
fought football game. There was a lot of good hitting on both sides. When you 
have a situation like that, emotions are high. 
</P>
<P>
"(The fight) started on their sideline. If it happened on our sideline, maybe 
their team would have raced across the field." 
</P>
<P>
Casillas seemed more upset immediately following the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure didn't look like we were well-disciplined tonight," he said. "We've 
never had that kind of problem before. This team is not going to have that type 
of behavior again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NO CLASS ACT 
</P>
<P>
Before they were herded into the locker room, several Hawthorne players got up 
on benches and raised their helmets to the crowd, inciting Hawthorne's fans 
into wild cheers. 
</P>
<P>
Said an Eisenhower assistant coach: "That's no class." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills, which played dismally in a 29-8 loss to Mary Star two weeks ago, 
appears to have ironed out its problems after edging previously unbeaten West 
Torrance, 14-12, Friday afternoon at Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable how much we have improved," said Coach Gary Kimbrell. "We 
had a lot of inexperienced kids. Maybe some of them were fat-headed going into 
the first game. We let them know it." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills tailback Robert Coulter, held to a career-low 36 yards in the 
opener, had his second consecutive impressive game, rushing for 213 yards and a 
touchdown on 25 carries. His 66-yard scoring run on the first play of the third 
quarter tied the game, and a two-point conversion pass from quarterback Bill 
DeMucci to tight end Matt Kuptz put the Titans ahead to stay, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Coulter said he was a little apprehensive about playing a big, physical West 
team. But once the game got under way, his doubts faded. 
</P>
<P>
"West has good size, but we weren't intimidated," he said. "We're playing Titan 
ball now. We're running hard and coming at 'em. We can't be stopped when we're 
doing that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NO PASSING FANCY 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, long known as a ball-control running team, has suddenly become one of 
the South Bay's big passing teams. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, says Coach Rich Busia, is the exceptional throwing ability of 
junior quarterback Jason Kendall, who passed for 198 yards and four touchdowns 
Friday night in the Tartars' 25-21 come-from-behind victory over Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't had kids in the past who could throw like him," Busia said. 
"We've never had anybody with his ability. That's what we're thankful for." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MISSED CHANCE 
</P>
<P>
Carson quarterback John Walsh, who tied a school record with four touchdown 
passes Friday in a 37-14 victory over Lynwood, almost had a record-setting 
fifth scoring throw. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter with the ball at the Lynwood 41, Walsh hit wide receiver 
Fred Sims on a post pattern. But before Sims could score he was hit from behind 
at the three and fumbled the ball into the end zone, where Lynwood recovered. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, Walsh has passed for 712 yards and five TDs. Do you think he 
regrets transferring from West Torrance? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
 -- West Torrance fell to Rolling Hills, 14-12, ending its regular-season 
winning streak at 11 games. 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower Coach Tom Hoak, on the bench-clearing brawl that marred the Eagles' 
21-6 victory at Hawthorne: "These kind of things take away from the victory a 
little bit. It was a frightening situation. I didn't know what was going on for 
a while." 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance Coach Joe Austin, on his team refusing to shake hands with 
Morningside following a 34-0 loss because he felt the Monarchs were trying to 
run up the score: "That was wrong on my part. But I'll talk to the Morningside 
coaches. I'll apologize to them." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve Carroll, on his team defeating Mira Costa, 21-20, 
for its first victory of the season: "It's a big confidence builder going into 
Mission League play against Crespi (on Friday). The league is going to be so 
competitive. Every team is capable of beating us, and we can beat any team. 
We're excited." 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance quarterback Allen Hook, on being sacked on a two-point 
conversion try with 1:40 remaining that sealed a 22-20 loss to Palos Verdes: 
"It was a pass (call), but I saw the guys covered, so I tried to cut back. But 
it didn't work out for me." 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance co-Coach John Black, on the trouble his team had tackling Rolling 
Hills tailback Robert Coulter, who rushed for 213 yards and a touchdown in the 
Titans' 14-12 victory: "If you take a shot at him, you better wrap him, up. 
He's one heck of a good athlete."

Leuzinger, which played last week without five injured starters, lost two more 
players Friday night in a 19-7 victory over Gardena. Coach Steve Carnes said 
offensive tackle Eric Donnelly and linebacker Anthony Prickett each suffered 
dislocated shoulders. Carnes said Donnelly will be out one to two weeks and 
Prickett will be sidelined about four weeks.

Paying for Troops in Japan 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 370 to 53 to require Japan to pay the $5-billion annual cost of 
stationing 50,000 U.S. troops and dependents there. This occurred during debate 
on the fiscal 1991 Defense Department budget (HR 4739). About 5,000 of the 
Americans would be withdrawn annually if Japan declined to start paying for 
them. U.S. troops are based in Japan to protect it as well as American regional 
interests. Sponsor David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) complained that "American workers 
are paying to protect Japan while Japan closes its markets to us." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent David O'B. Martin (R-N.Y.) said the amendment sends Japan an 
appropriate message but "would be more detrimental to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to require Japan to begin paying for the American troops it 
hosts.

Troops in Korea 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 157 to 265, the House rejected an amendment to bring more troops 
home from South Korea than the White House wants returned as world tensions 
ease. The amendment to the 1991 defense bill (above) sought to reduce U.S. 
forces in South Korea from 43,000 to 30,000 in the next few years, compared to 
the 36,000 level sought by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Robert J. Mrazek (D-N.Y.) said his amendment "would save us $3 billion 
over the next five years without affecting our deterrence capability." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) said: "North Korea has done nothing 
really to . . . change its dictatorial policies to warrant us lowering our 
guard." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cap U.S. military strength in South Korea at 30,000.

Student Loan Forgiveness 
</P>
<P>
The House refused, 200 to 212, to kill student loan forgiveness for new 
borrowers who have joined the proposed "national service." This occurred as the 
House sent to conference with the Senate a bill (HR 4330) establishing the 
volunteer corps, which would place youths in community jobs such as 
conservation and drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment sought to kill language canceling all interest and some principal 
on loans that volunteers receive after the bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Thomas E. Petri (R-Wis.) said Congress should not relinquish to a 
private official, such as a YMCA director, the power to forgive student loans. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Pat Williams (D-Mont.) said Peace Corps and Vista volunteers receive 
the same benefit, so "let's extend it as part of these 'thousand points of 
light' to other young Americans." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to eliminate loan forgiveness for national service volunteers.
