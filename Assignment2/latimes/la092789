LA MESA MAKER OF TOXIC GAS IS DENIED PERMIT 
</P>

<P>
The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District for the second time has 
denied an operating permit to Phoenix Research Corp., which produces highly 
toxic arsine and phosphine gases at its La Mesa plant. 
</P>
<P>
However, the denial could soon become moot because officials at Union Carbide's 
Linde Division, Phoenix Research's parent company, said Tuesday that the 
controversial plant will be closed in late December. The company will begin 
producing the two deadly gases at a remote plant now being completed in rural 
Arizona, Linde spokesman Jim Secor said. 
</P>
<P>
APCD Control Officer R. J. Sommerville said Tuesday that the plant "should not 
be operating at all" in La Mesa because the gases pose a severe threat to the 
health and safety of nearby residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubts About Closure 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville also expressed doubt that Linde will actually close the plant by 
the end of the year. In 1987, Linde failed to complete a previously announced 
move to Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
Linde, which expects to complete construction of the plant near Kingman, Ariz., 
by the end of January, has obtained applicable state environmental permits, 
said James A. Wilkinson, executive director of the Mohave County Airport 
Authority, a public agency that has sold land to Linde. Linde will not receive 
an operating permit until state regulators inspect the finished plant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego permit denial will have little or no immediate effect because 
regulators are "unable to enforce air pollution control laws against the firm" 
under a lawsuit initiated by Phoenix Research, Sommerville said. 
</P>
<P>
That court fight stemmed from the air pollution district's 1985 attempt to stop 
production of the gases at Phoenix Research. The plant has operated in La Mesa 
for 15 years, but regulators first learned about its existence from news 
reports in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, shortly after the district first refused to issue a permit, Phoenix 
Research won a court injunction that prohibited the district from enforcing its 
regulations at the plant. The company filed a court suit that challenged the 
district's right to issue permits and later appealed a Superior Court decision 
that recognized the district's right to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Phoenix Research installed a scrubber, a pollution-control 
device designed to eliminate 99.9% of the arsine and phosphine gas that might 
otherwise escape into the atmosphere during an accident. Then, Sommerville 
said, the APCD and Phoenix Research agreed that the district would issue a 
permit only if tests proved that the device neutralized 99.9% of the toxic 
gases that would escape during a "worst case" accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unhappy With Test Results 
</P>
<P>
The district withheld the permit in a letter to Phoenix on Friday after tests 
conducted by the company at another scrubber in another state failed to reach 
the 99.9% efficiency level, Sommerville said. The scrubber "has reduced the 
risk to the community but is still inadequate to meet APCD safety standards," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Secor on Tuesday said that the scrubber "did do what it was supposed to do" 
during the recent test. "The manufacturer of the scrubber has warranted to us 
that it's 99.9% effective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Secor, who said the plant has "never had an incident" during its 15 years in La 
Mesa, said the scrubber is providing sufficient protection for nearby residents 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But Sommerville, who said he does not know for sure whether the scrubber is now 
in use, said Tuesday that an accidental release of gases into the atmosphere 
would still cause a severe threat to people who live or work near the plant, at 
8075 Alvarado Road. 
</P>
<P>
Federal limits for the two gases are extremely low -- 0.3 parts per million 
(ppm) for phosphine and 0.05 ppm for arsine. A whiff of 500 ppm of arsine 
causes instant death by freezing the hemoglobin in red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
According to county records, Phoenix Research at any one time has on hand as 
much as 2,250 pounds of the deadly gas, which electronics companies use to 
produce circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goal Seems Unmet 
</P>
<P>
Diane Takvorian, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Health 
Coalition, on Tuesday questioned whether the permit refusal will have any 
effect. "It sounds like it doesn't achieve the goal that the community wants, 
which is to shut the facility down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Secor reaffirmed that the plant will leave San Diego for a new location outside 
Kingman by Dec. 31. "We're intending to operate at La Mesa no longer than the 
end of this year, about three more months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the permit denial will not speed the plant's closing. "I don't see us 
shutting down any earlier," Secor said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has 10 days to appeal the air pollution district's decision, and 
both sides have the option of going back to court, Sommerville said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant that has generated so much concern in La Mesa has also riled 
residents in Kingman, a small town in the northwest corner of Arizona, more 
than 100 miles east of Las Vegas. Linde's plan to build a plant in an 
industrial park near the county airport fell apart earlier this year after 
activists drew heavy support from many of Kingman's 12,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The company subsequently acquired another tract that sits 11 miles south of 
town. "It's much more isolated," Wilkinson said. "There ain't a swinging thing 
out there. They have to build their own roads . . . and drill their own wells." 
</P>
<P>
When completed, the plant -- along with a sister plant near the airport that 
will produce relatively benign gases -- will provide about 25 new jobs for 
residents, Wilkinson said. Another 25 employees will move to the town from 
existing Linde operations. 
</P>
<P>
Although a "hard-core group" still opposes the plant, a "clear majority" now 
favors it at the far-flung location, Wilkinson said. However, the opposition 
"has set us way back in terms of doing economic development," Wilkinson said. 
"As far as our reputation goes, it set us back at least two years." 
</P>
<P>
A Phoenix Research executive earlier this year said that the company would 
spend at least $225,000 on the scrubber. The device would be moved to the new 
plant in Arizona before gas production begins, the executive said.

James H. Meredith, the first black person to enroll at the University of 
Mississippi 27 years ago, has been hired by conservative Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.), who has opposed civil rights bills and other domestic programs 
favored by many blacks. Meredith, 56, has changed his views markedly over the 
years. Integration is the "biggest con job ever pulled on anybody," he has 
said. "My understanding of the senator's position . . . is that every citizen 
has the entitlement to every right. So there's no need for any specific rights. 
And I agree with that." Meredith said that he had been hired to advise the 
senator on questions of race, education, drugs and urban problems, after 
providing informal advice for the last year.

 -- Ernest Hemingway had a reputation for playing hard. Apparently, he worked 
hard too. Hemingway labored for six months over the final chapter to his second 
novel, "A Farewell to Arms," writing scores of different endings before 
settling on the version that appeared in print. "There's this image of 
Hemingway as a raucous, drinking guy and not a guy sitting so carefully at his 
desk and slaving over the ending. Most people would instead picture Hemingway 
dashing the ending off and going out to catch a marlin," said Lisa Middents, 
assistant to the curator of the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy 
Library in Boston. An exhibit of some of the 44 pages of draft endings, mostly 
handwritten, goes on display today at the Hemingway Collection. The exhibit 
commemorates the 60th anniversary of the novel's Sept. 27, 1929, publication by 
Charles Scribner's Sons. The novel, set in Italy and Switzerland during World 
War I, chronicles the romance between a young American ambulance driver and an 
English nurse at an American Red Cross Hospital in Milan.

 -- Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) took exception with U.S. News &amp; World 
Report's depiction of Tennessee as a backward state. In last week's issue of 
the magazine, there was a listing of what various jobs pay around the country, 
but the map of Tennessee was upside down and backward. In a humorous protest 
letter to U.S. News Editor-in-Chief Mort Zuckerman, Gore said that though no 
one might notice if one flipped Wyoming or Colorado, that is not so when 
Tennessee is turned inside out. "I hope the magazine didn't mean to move 
Memphis," Gore wrote. "As you know, every Federal Express package in the 
country must first pass through Memphis. Put the city in the wrong place and 
the entire U.S. economy would fall apart. . . . " SHIRLEY MARLOW

BILL BARRON, 62; JAZZ COMPOSER, MUSIC EDUCATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Barron, a reed player, jazz composer and educator, died last week in a 
Middletown, Conn., hospital near Wesleyan University, where he had been a 
professor of music for the last several years. Barron, whose career began in 
his native Philadelphia 40 years ago, was 62 when he died Thursday of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Born William Barron Jr., he studied piano and tenor saxophone before mastering 
the flute and soprano sax and came to New York City in the 1950s to perform 
with Cecil Taylor, Philly Joe Jones and others. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first jobs was with the Carolina Cotton Pickers. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Jones, Benny Golson, John Coltrane and Jimmy Heath, Barron was 
considered one of the talented, bop-oriented musicians to emerge from 
Philadelphia after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about coming up in Philly," Barron said in a long-ago interview, "is 
that all the fellows used to get together quite often. I remember always going 
over to somebody's apartment or somebody's brother's place, with people like 
Johnny Coles, Ray Bryant, Jimmy Heath and Calvin Massey, and we'd compare 
notes." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s he began to play clubs with his brother Kenny, a pianist. 
</P>
<P>
From 1968 to 1974, Bill Barron was director of the Jazz Workshop at MUSE (the 
Bedford Lincoln Neighborhood Museum, operated by the Brooklyn Children's 
Museum), where he presented regular concerts and taught improvisation, 
composing, arranging, theory and reeds. 
</P>
<P>
He started jazz programs on New York City radio and taught jazz at City 
University of New York and Afro-American music at Wesleyan. 
</P>
<P>
He earned a doctorate in education from the University of Massachusetts and was 
seen on New York's PBS station WNET discussing music in the context of the 
neighborhoods of the city. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Broadcast Music Inc. honored him with its Pioneer of Jazz Award. 
</P>
<P>
His seminal recordings include "The Next Plateau;" "Variations in Blue," which 
in 1985 Times jazz critic Leonard Feather said contained "explosive hard-bop 
lines;" "Jazz Caper;" "Tenor Stylings of Bill Barron;" "Motivation" and "The 
Hot Line." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Anna; two daughters; his mother; another brother 
and two sisters.

HEDGECOCK STICKS TO HIS STORY WHILE TESTIFYING FOR HUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insisting that he had only "totally proper" personal and political financial 
dealings with Nancy Hoover Hunter, former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock told 
a U. S. District Court jury Tuesday that a campaign consulting firm funded by 
Hunter was a legitimate business, not a device to funnel illegal contributions 
to his 1983 mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating testimony from his 1985 trial, Hedgecock testified in Hunter's fraud 
and tax-evasion trial that Hunter bankrolled the consulting firm, started by a 
mutual friend, Tom Shepard, in the early 1980s as a routine business 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Showing flashes of his trademark combativeness as he stuck to a story that he 
has told frequently inside and outside courtrooms for 4 1/2 years, Hedgecock 
contended that, contrary to prosecutors' allegations, Tom Shepard &amp; 
Associates was not merely a sham operation established primarily to illegally 
finance his mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
"Was there any discussion with Nancy Hoover or Tom Shepard about funneling 
money to your campaign?" Hunter defense attorney Richard 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro asked Hedgecock. 
</P>
<P>
"No, never," Hedgecock answered. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, the former J. David &amp; Co. executive who, like Shepard, was one of 
Hedgecock's closest allies during a political career that ended with his 1985 
felony conviction, is being tried on 197 counts of fraud and tax evasion 
stemming from her involvement with the now-defunct La Jolla investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's namesake and Hunter's former live-in companion, J. David (Jerry) 
Dominelli, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to 
charges of bilking investors out of more than $80 million through an elaborate 
Ponzi scheme in which clients were lured to the firm through phony records and 
the promise of fabulous returns on their money. 
</P>
<P>
Called as a defense witness, Hedgecock is one of the means by which Hunter's 
attorneys hope to rebut prosecutors' contention that Hunter improperly took a 
tax deduction for her investment in Shepard's firm when, in fact, she knew it 
to be nothing more than a ruse to disguise tens of thousands of dollars in 
illegal contributions to his 1983 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, however, by hoping to score points through Hedgecock's 
testimony, the defense was forced to rely on someone who has been found guilty 
of conspiracy charges that both Hunter and Shepard -- as well as Dominelli -- 
pleaded guilty to in 1986 plea-bargain deals. Thus, Hedgecock's denial Tuesday 
of wrongdoing in his tangled financial and political relationship with the 
three is contradicted by his own verdict -- which he argues was tainted by a 
bailiff's jury tampering -- and three guilty pleas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Testimony 
</P>
<P>
During his 1 1/2 hours on the stand before U. S. District Judge Earl Gilliam, 
Hedgecock delivered testimony similar to that which he gave in his first 1985 
trial, which ended in a mistrial with the jury deadlocked, 11 to 1, in favor of 
his conviction on conspiracy and perjury charges. Hedgecock did not testify in 
his second trial, in which he was convicted of 13 felony counts stemming from 
charges that he falsified financial disclosure statements to conceal illegal J. 
David contributions funneled to his campaign via Shepard's firm. 
</P>
<P>
Now a radio talk-show host, Hedgecock is free pending appeal of his one-year 
jail sentence -- an appeal in which an appellate panel's order for a full court 
hearing on the jury-tampering allegations figures prominently. 
</P>
<P>
Describing what he knew of Shepard's firm's formative period, Hedgecock said 
that, in December, 1981, Shepard, who then served on Hedgecock's county 
supervisorial staff, told him that he planned to leave to start a consulting 
firm to be funded by Hunter. Noting that he and Hunter had had a falling out 
after she left her husband to live with Dominelli, Hedgecock stressed that he 
had no conversations with Hunter about that deal, adding that he relied solely 
on Shepard's characterization of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1982, Hedgecock's campaign committee signed a contract with Shepard 
for what then was an exploratory potential race for mayor -- a contest that 
hinged on a vacancy being created by then-Mayor Pete Wilson's victory in the 
November, 1982, U. S. Senate election. At the time, Hedgecock said he believed 
that Shepard's firm had other clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you have any reason to believe that Tom Shepard &amp; Associates was 
anything other than a legitimate political consulting firm?" defense attorney 
Marmaro asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No -- I thought it was legitimate," Hedgecock said. 
</P>
<P>
During his cross-examination by Assistant U. S. Atty. Stephen Clark, Hedgecock 
visibly enjoyed the verbal jousting that led to several acerbic observations 
from both sides, managing along the way to get in a few digs against some 
longtime foes -- in particular, the San Diego Union and Tribune newspapers, 
which he contends have treated him unfairly for years. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, however, drew first blood by beginning his questioning of Hedgecock by 
asking: "Are you the same Roger Hedgecock who was convicted in Superior Court 
in October, 1985?" Hedgecock responded affirmatively, hastening to add that the 
case is on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Letter of Praise 
</P>
<P>
The first of several light moments came when prosecutors sought to document the 
warmth and closeness of Hedgecock's relationship with Hunter in an effort to 
undermine his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Clark produced a letter sent by Hedgecock to Hunter in the early 
1980s in which he said that a story about her that appeared in the San Diego 
Tribune "looked great." Dismissing the letter as "one of hundreds" written 
weekly for him by his staff, Hedgecock generated loud laughter among courtroom 
spectators by adding: "I don't recall writing it, and I wouldn't have been so 
lavish in my praise of the local paper." 
</P>
<P>
On various occasions, Clark sought a yes or no answer from Hedgecock, only to 
receive a longer explanation that frustrated the prosecutor's attempt to pin 
down the former mayor. Once, for example, Clark inquired whether Hedgecock was 
aware in the early 1980s that Hunter was wildly spending hundreds of thousands 
of dollars on things such as houses and exotic cars, only to have Hedgecock 
answer: "I was aware Nancy was a benefactor of a number of organizations in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
"So the answer to my question is yes?" Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is the answer I gave you," Hedgecock snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Clark also pressed Hedgecock for now-familiar details on his personal financial 
dealings with Hunter, including a controversial oral-agreement loan that 
Hedgecock used to remodel his South Mission Hills house shortly after being 
elected mayor in May, 1983. That loan, which Hedgecock repaid with interest 
started out at $50,000, but as expenses grew, it reached $130,000. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in his own trial, Hedgecock insisted that, to the best of his 
knowledge, Hunter used her personal funds for the loan, not -- as was shown 
during his trial -- J. David corporate revenue. When asked about the lack of 
conventional documentation of the loan's terms, Hedgecock said: "She's not an 
institution or savings and loan. This was a personal loan . . . between 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to reinforce prosecutors' view of Tom Shepard &amp; Associates as little 
more than a laundering operation for illegal political contributions, Clark 
pointed to Hedgecock campaign expenses that were paid with J. David funds. In 
each case, however, Hedgecock insisted that he had assumed that his campaign 
committee had paid the bills or was unaware of the specifics.

A Times reader recently complained in Jack Smith's column that alphabetical 
telephone numbers, such as DIAL-DWP, take too long to dial. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you have searched out the letters," said Ray G. Coutchie, "you 
could have punched the numbers out, had your conversation and hung up." 
</P>
<P>
Coutchie added: "This particular item has bugged me for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, how times change. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades ago, many Californians were upset over the disappearance of 
letter prefixes from their phone numbers. HOllywood, for instance, was replaced 
by 46, ATlantic by 28, and VErmont by 83. 
</P>
<P>
Ma Bell's "digitalization" campaign inspired the formation of the Anti-Digi 
Dialing League in San Francisco and the Utility Users League in Los Angeles, 
which fought valiant, if unsuccessful, battles. 
</P>
<P>
The dismay was in part nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli said that dropping a letter prefix was like 
"tearing down a stately Victorian mansion and replacing it with a a parking 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
But there was also fear that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to 
remember a seven-digit number. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Telephone vice president inadvertently lent credence to that theory 
when he was questioned by an attorney for the Utility Users League at a hearing 
in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you have trouble remembering seven digits?" the attorney asked. 
</P>
<P>
"None at all," the vice president replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Please tell me your license plate number," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president recited the three letters on his plate but couldn't remember 
the three digits. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of letters and numbers: 
</P>
<P>
Michael Tscheekar of Westchester challenges anyone to pronounce the name of the 
street sign on La Cienega Boulevard (in accompanying photo). 
</P>
<P>
"One Hundred Elevenst?" Tscheekar asks. "One Hundred One-One-Est? Or what?" 
</P>
<P>
Or what seems easiest. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's Fishy" is the headline in Alaska Airlines magazine above an item 
about a Fishermen's Fiesta scheduled this weekend in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"Fishy" in more ways than one. The magazine says that San Pedro is "just north 
of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
As the Duke demonstrated to the Hulk, the pen is mightier than the headlock. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, a Sacramento middleweight, signed a bill that in effect 
decreed that Hulk Hogan, Junkyard Dog, Brutus Beefcake and other professional 
wrestlers are entertainers, not athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, introduced by Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Gardena), stripped the 
state Athletic Commission of its control over wrestling, despite howls of 
protest from the grapplers. 
</P>
<P>
"It ain't a sport, it ain't an athletic contest," Floyd explained.

<P>
Traveling eastbound on the Santa Monica Freeway at around 7:15 a.m., Sept. 15, 
I witnessed a somewhat remarkable occurrence. Trotting along the divider, 
during rush hour traffic, was a frightened young dog. 
</P>
<P>
How does a dog get in the middle of a major freeway? How long had the dog been 
there? I saw this dog and I was concerned, yet I did not stop. God forbid I 
should be late for work. 
</P>
<P>
One person pulled over to the shoulder -- a young man driving a somewhat 
banged-up brown Datsun. I just wanted to say thank you. It's nice to know there 
is someone who recognizes the difference between life and death and the 
consequences of an action. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are those of us who drive on by, thinking about what we saw, 
knowing we did not stop.

QUAYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabeth Watson's statement that "maybe Bush deserves congratulations for 
choosing Quayle in spite of how foolish a move it seemed about a year ago," in 
response to Vice President Dan Quayle's public assessment of "Star Wars," 
deserves comment (letter, Sept. 21). 
</P>
<P>
The job President Bush gave Quayle -- to pop President Reagan's "Star War" 
bubble -- could have just as easily been given to any vice president at hand, 
or to the secretary of state, for that matter. Quayle remains a disastrously 
ignorant next-in-command in case President Bush dies in office. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing how responsibly Bush behaves in his job as President, I hope that at the 
end of his first term he will quietly replace Quayle with a fully competent and 
knowledgeable person, especially in view of the added danger to Bush from the 
Colombian drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
This country has always taken its luck for granted. We shouldn't have to wait 
to see what happens.

U.S. COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend Rep. Levine for his call for a demonstration of "American resolve and 
staying power in the pursuit of peace in the Middle East." Indeed, it has been 
10 years since we assumed an assertive and activist role of the kind we 
performed in securing the Camp David accords. 
</P>
<P>
But to be effective, President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker must 
have a broader vision of the U.S. role than Levine's. The U.S. must demonstrate 
a respect for the views of Israelis and Palestinians, a commitment to the 
legitimate rights of both, and a conviction that a continuation of the conflict 
is abhorrent to U.S., not because of our national "interest and prestige," but 
because of our basic values as a nation. These are what compel us to seek a 
peace that will relieve the human suffering this conflict has imposed upon 
Arabs and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Levine refers to the death of Israeli soldiers and to PLO leader Yasser 
Arafat's "support for the odious policy of killing 'collaborators' resulting in 
100 deaths." Although he failed to mention it, I know he must hold at least 
equally odious the death of more than 600 Palestinians and the imprisonment of 
thousands at the hands of Israeli military authorities. 
</P>
<P>
This Administration has taken an important step: Affirming its support of 
Israel, it opened the dialogue with the PLO. This move and the intifada itself 
have served as a catalyst in creating a fresh opportunity for progress, and in 
eliciting the Israeli proposal for elections in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is a time for a diplomacy of action. But there is no need to do it 
alone. Egypt, the Soviet Union, and others can make a valuable contribution, as 
Sweden has already, and should not be excluded. The urgency of this historical 
moment calls for a more embracing view of the possibilities.

Thank you for publishing "No Peace for the Peacemakers" by Hillel Bardin, Op-Ed 
Page, Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The original Zionist myth was "There are no Palestinians" period. Recently the 
Israeli government replaced the original with one that states: "There are no 
Palestinians who are willing to talk peace." 
</P>
<P>
Bardin's column went a long way to shatter this myth. He eloquently presented 
the case of only five Palestinians. Like them, there are thousands who have 
been jailed, expelled, or even killed by the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
We not only have a moral stake in the peace between Israel and the 
Palestinians, we also have a huge financial stake. Our moral obligation is to 
make sure that our money is not used to silence the peacemakers.

A LAW CAN'T DO IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislation signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian will not, in itself, 
resolve the long battle over the City of Los Angeles' water diversions from the 
Mono Lake Basin on the east side of the Sierra Nevada 300 miles from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Before that can happen, the city Department of Water and Power and the private 
nonprofit Mono Lake Committee must find other sources of water to replace the 
supply that the city would relinquish in order to halt the 50-year drain on the 
unique lake. Then the parties must apply to the state for the use of a 
$60-million fund to buy the alternate supplies, or perhaps finance conservation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the Mono Lake Committee, in fact, have been working with the 
Environmental Defense Fund for some time to find other water, possibly excess 
irrigation water in California's San Joaquin Valley. The legislation by 
Assemblymen Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) and William P. Baker (R-Danville) 
formalizes that process in state law. 
</P>
<P>
But the two bills do something far more important: Through state legislation, 
they begin to implement the public trust doctrine of water use in California, 
which was recognized for the first time by the California Supreme Court in a 
1983 case involving Mono Lake brought by the National Audubon Society and the 
Mono Lake Committee. Until that time, Los Angeles' right to divert water from 
Mono Basin streams that naturally flow into Mono Lake was considered virtually 
inviolate under the old Western water doctrine of appropriative rights. Under 
this rule, the first person to divert the water obtained the water right. 
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court said such water rights were not absolute. The court held 
that Los Angeles' right had to be balanced by public trust interests such as 
water needed to maintain fish, wildlife and recreational uses of the lake and 
the streams that feed it. Meanwhile, the city has lost other suits that 
restrict Mono stream diversions in order to protect the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The public trust doctrine was the driving force behind the Isenberg-Baker laws, 
along with common sense and the reality of public concern for the environment. 
And the legislation carried the idea one logical step further: If this water is 
taken from the city in the interest of the public, the public should compensate 
the city -- or if not all the public, then a substantial segment of it. 
</P>
<P>
The Mono Lake fund was created with money owed to the state by contractors of 
the State Water Project who serve a majority of California's 28 million 
residents. The $65 million will offset Los Angeles' loss only for a relatively 
few years, but another important principle has been established. 
</P>
<P>
There are two ways to look at the Mono Lake situation. On one hand, it has 
seemed to take forever to get Los Angeles, the courts and Legislature to halt 
an environmental wrong. On the other hand, California water law has undergone a 
radical revolution in the direction of environmental protection in just six 
short years. In the case of Mono Lake, there is considerable truth in both 
statements.

AT LAST . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials are at last moving to reorganize the 
administration of Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. Time will 
determine whether they have moved fast enough to preserve the federal and state 
funding that are essential to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization seems to have come reluctantly and belatedly, as much as a 
year after facts had made clear that the hospital was not meeting basic 
standards and that patients' lives were at risk. Indeed, the central action of 
the reform, transferring the administrator, reportedly was weighed months ago 
but abandoned in the face of community support for the incumbent. Now there 
will be an interim administrator while a national search is conducted for a 
permanent leader. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed word from the U.S. Health Care Finance Administration that 
the hospital would lose about $60 million in annual federal funding effective 
Dec. 21 unless the egregious problems at the hospital had been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
That warning came after state officials had uncovered serious defects in all of 
the major areas of operation, indicating a deplorable breakdown in supervision 
and administration. The county will respond to the state report on Friday and 
to the federal report within two weeks. Those responses will measure the 
seriousness of the reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the audit inspection unit of the County Department of Health 
Services is completing an internal investigation, with a report promised within 
two weeks. Unfortunately, the county appears to be resisting bringing in 
expert, independent, outside professionals to monitor the reform process. Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner is on record as favoring expansion of the Board of 
Supervisors' own investigation to include medical and health-care experts 
outside the County Department of Health Services. California abounds with 
nationally recognized authorities in all of the affected areas. Their expertise 
needs to be mobilized, and quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The special meeting of the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday was called because 
county officials "have known for a long time that there are operational 
problems at King -- that it's not just a funding problem, but that there's a 
need for a shift and change in management," according to the senior deputy of 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum. That's an extraordinary admission, seeming to 
confirm the earlier finding of state investigators that the supervisors had 
failed in their legally mandated responsibility to supervise the hospital and 
assure its quality. 
</P>
<P>
The medical center is one of the most important links in the fragile 
health-care system of the county. Its staff includes many outstanding 
professionals who have served there at personal sacrifice and with distinction. 
Their commitment, and the commitment of the hospital to provide quality care to 
South Central Los Angeles have been betrayed by those who have failed to 
provide prudent, appropriate leadership and supervision and support.

LIVES, RESEARCH HINGE ON LIMITING NEW AIDS DRUG; 
</P>
<P>
FREE ACCESS ONLY FOR THE DESPERATELY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL R. SCHRAM, Neil R. Schram, an internist in Harbor City, is chairman of 
the AIDS Task Force for the American Assn. of Physicians for Human Rights. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A landmark medical experiment is about to begin: A new, unproven drug will be 
provided to thousands of people who desperately need it while research is 
conducted on its safety and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
This "parallel track" of research and simultaneous free drug distribution of 
the drug is the result of immense pressure from AIDS activists to make 
experimental drugs available as early as possible. The program will, however, 
still have an important limit, one that must be accepted for the "parallel 
track" experiment to work: The drug will be made available only to those who 
definitely need it, and not to all those who might want it. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental drug, DDI, will be made available to people who are unable to 
benefit from the only approved AIDS anti-virus drug, AZT. The first people to 
receive DDI will be those with AIDS or AIDS-related symptoms who get too sick 
from AZT to tolerate it. Around the same time, it is expected that the new drug 
will also be given to people who are taking AZT but are still getting sick, as 
shown by opportunistic infections, progressive weight loss, severe fatigue and 
so on. 
</P>
<P>
There will be thousands of others who are likely to want DDI -- people who have 
decided that AZT is too toxic to take without trying it, and those who are 
doing well on AZT but mistakenly believe that DDI has been proven to be a 
superior drug. These people will not be able to get DDI, at least until more 
research is completed. 
</P>
<P>
This decision to limit an experimental drug to those who need it is a wise and 
important one. DDI has been tested on fewer than 100 people. These studies 
suggest that over a short term, DDI is less toxic than AZT. However, we do not 
have adequate information about long-term side effects. 
</P>
<P>
More important, there is no solid information about whether DDI is as effective 
as, or more or less effective than, AZT. Indeed, limited information from the 
manufacturer suggests it may be somewhat less effective. 
</P>
<P>
But the fundamental question is: Why shouldn't people who want the drug be 
allowed to have it? Shouldn't people with a life-threatening illness be given 
any hope they want? 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that people who are sick and cannot tolerate AZT, or are 
getting sick in spite of AZT, need DDI as their only current hope. But for the 
others, a proven alternative is available. AZT does prolong life and keep many 
people productive, and at the lower doses now advised, its toxicity appears 
much less than before. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the question persists: Why shouldn't people be allowed to choose? The 
answer is both practical and philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, if an experimental drug were available to anyone who wanted it, 
there would be little incentive for people to enter research studies, and 
without studies proving a drug safe and effective, it could not be approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration and then marketed. Instead, the drug company 
would have to provide the drug free to thousands of people. (An FDA physician 
estimates that it costs up to $5,000 per patient per year to provide a drug for 
free -- and that is just the administrative cost; it does not include the cost 
of the drug itself.) Obviously, if a drug can not be marketed, there will be no 
incentive for the company to continue its free distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if that were to happen to DDI, the prototype of the parallel-track 
experiment, and the drug were not marketed, it is highly probable that other 
drug companies would be discouraged from undertaking research on drugs for AIDS 
and other life-threatening diseases. That decision would be a disaster for 
millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, how can people decide that DDI is a better choice for them than AZT? 
At this point, the answer is they cannot decide -- we simply do not know. That 
is why research is so critical. That is how we learned that AZT works, and that 
aerosolized pentamidine prevents the most common pneumonia seen in AIDS. It is 
also how we learned about two previously highly touted drugs -- suramin was too 
toxic and dextran sulfate was not absorbed, so it was of no benefit. But if all 
these and other "promising" drugs were made widely available, no one would have 
adequate information to make an intelligent choice about what drug or drugs to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
Society often assumes a responsibility for protecting people from potentially 
dangerous situations. Thus we tolerate seat-belt laws, speed limits and the 
requirement that drugs be proven safe and effective before they are made widely 
available. That is acceptable and wise. 
</P>
<P>
To completely do away with regulations that protect people from unproven drugs 
would lead to chaos and many unnecessary deaths. Even if the right to choose 
were granted, people would not have sufficient information to make an 
intelligent choice among untested drugs. So research and appropriate 
regulations must be protected. 
</P>
<P>
For people with no option -- people for whom AZT cannot do what it has done and 
is doing for others -- DDI must be made immediately available. For the others, 
AZT should be taken until we know more about DDI. And AIDS activists should be 
proud of the changes they have wrought.

INDEX THE GAINS TAX; DON'T CUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. MAKIN and JONATHAN MORGAN, John Makin is director of fiscal policy 
studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. Jonathan Morgan was 
a summer intern at the insttitute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After focusing for months on extraneous arguments about revenue effects 
(probably zero) and fairness (a red herring), the capital gains debate has 
taken a politically bizarre twist. The Democratic-controlled House is about to 
vote on a very Republican capital gains measure that would cut the capital 
gains tax rate to 19.6% for two years, then index capital gains to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
By insisting on two years of a "differential" lower capital gains tax rate, the 
bill, authored by Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.), risks seeing the two years stretch 
on indefinitely through the actions of rate-cut supporters. And by rejecting a 
superior alternative plan to index capital gains for inflation right away, the 
Ways and Means Committee has jeopardized passage of any capital gains measure. 
</P>
<P>
Indexing, which would exempt from taxes any profits up to the level of 
inflation, is best on economic grounds. It looks as if it would be better 
politics as well, in view of opposition to the Jenkins bill by powerful 
Democrats like House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Senate Finance Committee 
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
Indexing capital gains on new investment, as Ways and Means Committee Chairman 
Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) originally proposed, avoids the harmful effects of 
taxing illusory inflation gains and eliminates the fairness issue, since it 
means that taxpayers, whatever their bracket, will see their capital gains 
taxed as ordinary income. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the primary opposition to indexing capital gains comes from a small 
segment of the business community that claims that indexing does not provide 
adequate incentives for high-risk investors. Says former Rep. Edward Zchau, now 
a high-tech executive in California, "in order to inspire patient, long-term 
risk capital, you have to go further" than indexing capital gains. "Going 
further" means cutting the tax rate on unindexed gains to 15% or 20%. 
</P>
<P>
This opposition to indexing represents part of a long tradition of business 
community opposition to tax measures that turn out to be highly beneficial. 
When President John F. Kennedy in 1961 proposed a "radical" measure to spur 
investment with the investment tax credit, business reaction was almost 
uniformly negative. One accountant termed the proposal "vague, uncertain in 
application . . . its effect on revenue is doubtful and unpredictable." Of 
course, once it was understood, the investment tax credit became one of the 
most popular tax measures ever enjoyed by business. 
</P>
<P>
The argument for a differential capital gains rate of 15% or 20% instead of 
indexing capital gains comes down to a claim that the differential rate is 
necessary to provide adequate rewards for risky ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Most economists, not to mention many venture capitalists, agree that the market 
already provides adequate compensation for additional risks. For example, 
during the 1951-88 period, for five-year holding periods, investors in the 
stock market who switched from less-risky S&amp;P 500 companies to riskier 
smaller companies increased their average return by 373% (from 3.05% to 11.37%) 
while the most common measure of risk rose by only 50% (from 7.31% to 10.93%.) 
</P>
<P>
By far the oddest thing about venture capitalists and other commentators on 
capital gains is their failure to examine carefully the question of whether 
they would be better off with differential capital gains rates or indexing. 
Indexing wins hands down. When it comes to reducing uncertainty about the 
after-tax real return on an investment, indexing means that an investor is 
relieved of having to forecast the inflation rate to calculate the return. This 
is not true with a differential capital gains rate, which, once fixed, can 
leave the investor with inadequate or excessive protection against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, indexing actually results in a lower tax rate on capital gains 
than the proposed 19.6% rate. For five-year investments, given a typical 4% 
inflation rate, indexing beats a 20% capital gains tax rate for projects with 
assumed annual real returns of up to nearly 20%. In short, indexing is the best 
way to reward the longer-term investments favored by Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady. The longer an investment is held, the more gains accrue from 
deferral of tax, while indexing protects against erosion of real returns by 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Rostenkowski proposal even included an option whereby after five years, 
investors could choose between inflation indexing and being taxed on only 75% 
of the selling price of the asset. This option means that if, after five years, 
you have a project that earns more than a 32% annual real return, you would be 
better off under his alternative. The cost is minimal because only a tiny 
fraction of investment projects would consistently yield real returns over five 
years of more then 30%. But if the alternative made some venture capitalists 
feel better, more power to them. 
</P>
<P>
Indexing capital gains was part of the Treasury's original landmark tax reform 
proposal that ultimately led to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Let's hope that 
Congress can regroup on a sound policy to index capital gains and that the 
President will recognize indexing as a valuable modification to the tax code 
that will do more to encourage investment than any other measure.

<P>
The principals of four San Diego County schools that were selected for the 1989 
National School Recognition Program will travel to Washington to receive awards 
Thursday from President Bush and Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos. 
</P>
<P>
The schools to be honored are Mt. Carmel High School in Poway, Vista High 
School, Oak Grove Middle School in Jamul and Valley Center Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego County did exceptionally well in this competition," county Supt. of 
Schools Thomas C. Boysen said. "I'm pleased that our county will be 
well-represented at the White House." 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 public secondary schools throughout the nation were nominated for 
the awards. The field was finally narrowed to 176 winners from 42 states. 
California led the nation with 24 winners. 
</P>
<P>
The awards were made based on test scores, teaching practices and levels of 
parent and community involvement. In addition, each nominated school received a 
two-day visit last spring by a team from the U. S. Department of Education. The 
review teams interviewed students, parents and teachers, and analyzed 
educational records.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido man arrested Friday in the Central Valley on suspicion of killing 
a woman admitted committing the crime to two people, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Filomeno C. Huerta, 23, pleaded innocent Monday to murder in the the Sept. 5 
slaying of Sylvia Flores, 23, also of Escondido, whose body was discovered in a 
drainage ditch Sept. 16 in the 14100 block of San Pasqual Road. 
</P>
<P>
Huerta was arrested Friday in Kingsburg and brought to San Diego on Sunday by 
homicide detectives. 
</P>
<P>
According to a declaration by San Diego Police Detective Richard Thwing, Huerta 
admitted killing the woman to the two people, who later contacted police. Both 
said that Huerta told them they would be killed if they ever told police about 
what he had said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two said he saw blood on Huerta's face, pants and shirt Sept. 5, the 
day of the killing. Huerta told that person, according to the declaration, that 
he stabbed Flores but that the knife bent, so he then dragged her to the side 
of the road and hit her with a large rock. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 7, Huerta and the witness drove near the location of the body, where 
Huerta allegedly pointed to where he had left it, the declaration says. That 
witness later led Escondido police to the site where the body was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
According to Thwing, a broken concrete block with blood on it and a bloody rock 
were found nearby. At another location, police found a bent knife with 
bloodstains. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $1 million by San Diego Municipal Judge Frank Brown. A 
preliminary hearing was scheduled for Oct. 11.

GAS LEAK SENDS 20 PACOIMA STUDENTS, TEACHER'S AIDE TO HOSPITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Natural gas escaping from a ruptured pipeline in Pacoima drifted onto the 
campus of a nearby junior high school early Tuesday, temporarily halting 
classes and sending 20 students and a teacher's aide to hospitals with 
complaints of eye irritation and nausea, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers at Charles Maclay Junior High School first noticed the 
smell shortly before 9 a.m., about 45 minutes after school had started, 
Principal Leonard George said. School officials called the Los Angeles Fire 
Department and directed students to leave their classrooms and gather on 
athletic fields, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The smell was very strong," George said. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 students who complained of nausea and other ailments were examined by 
paramedics and taken to three nearby hospitals for observation, George said. 
All were released to their parents by early afternoon, hospital representatives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A teacher's aide who is six months pregnant was transferred to the AMI Tarzana 
Regional Medical Center for 24-hour observation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A contractor's crew working about 1 1/2 miles south of the school accidentally 
cut a section of 12-inch pipe in the 10200 block of Glenoaks Boulevard shortly 
before 8 a.m., said Vicki Cho, Southern California Gas Co. spokeswoman. 
Pressurized natural gas escaped for about an hour, causing temporary evacuation 
of about a dozen businesses in the largely industrial area along Glenoaks, Cho 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our crews shut off the gas at about 9 a.m.," Cho said. "We got a few calls 
from customers in the area complaining about the odor. It's not harmful once it 
is dissipated in the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Cho said the weather -- hot, humid and smoggy -- may have made the smell worse. 
"When it's like this, odors just hang," she said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTIES RULED JUSTIFIED IN KILLING SUICIDAL MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The actions of three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were justified when 
they fatally shot a suicidal man who charged at one of them with a claw-ended 
gardening tool, the district attorney's office concluded Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The independent investigation of the May 18 death of Lawrence Watts, 31, 
concluded that Deputies Mark Richardson, James Vetrovec and Mario Carrillo 
acted in self-defense of Richardson, a letter from the district attorney's 
office to the Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Watts was shot in the parking lot of the Antelope Valley Medical Center after 
leading deputies on a two-hour, low-speed pursuit through Lancaster following 
an attempted traffic stop. After Watts finally stopped his pickup truck in the 
parking lot, he got out holding a bloody spading claw and making a growling 
sound, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Watts ignored several shouted orders to freeze and charged at Richardson, the 
letter said. All three deputies opened fire on Watts and he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave every indication that he was dangerous and unpredictable," said the 
letter written by Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth R. Freeman. "This was genuinely an 
emergency situation. Based upon the available evidence, it appears that at the 
time Deputies Richardson, Vetrovec and Carrillo fired their weapons, they 
reasonably believed that Mr. Watts was attempting to seriously injure or kill 
Deputy Richardson." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators learned after the shooting that Watts had slashed his wrists with 
the spading claw during the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's letter said Watts had been released three weeks earlier 
from a hospital where he was treated for being depressed, suicidal and 
psychotic.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OVERTURNS ENCINO RESTAURANT'S DISCO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encino homeowners persuaded a Los Angeles City Council planning committee 
Tuesday to overturn a zoning board decision and prevent a Ventura Boulevard 
restaurant from opening a disco. 
</P>
<P>
A.J.'s Supper Club had applied for permission to add a small dance floor to its 
restaurant and bar at 17337 Ventura Blvd., operating until midnight weekdays 
and 1 a.m. weekends. A city zoning administrator had denied that application, 
but the Board of Zoning Appeals overruled the administrator's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the Planning and Land Use Management Committee on Tuesday, 
residents of adjacent neighborhoods said there already are at least four 
establishments within a block of A.J.'s that offer late-night dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Emanuel Sedacca said patrons "get a head start" by drinking while 
waiting in line to enter the clubs. One more disco would be too much to bear, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members voted unanimously to support the neighbors' appeal and deny 
the dance floor proposal. The issue is scheduled to go Oct. 11 to the full City 
Council.

L.A. LIABLE FOR LOPEZ CANYON ODORS; 
</P>
<P>
SMALL CLAIMS RULING AWARDS $501 TO DUMP'S NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando small claims court judge Tuesday ordered the city of Los Angeles 
to pay a Kagel Canyon resident $501 in damages for noxious gases blown into his 
home from the nearby Lopez Canyon Landfill, a decision the disgruntled neighbor 
said will encourage dozens more such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Pro Tem Robert Keimach ordered the city Bureau of 
Sanitation to pay Rob Zapple, a critic of Lopez Canyon, $1 for suffering, and 
$500 in punitive damages for failing to install a gas collection system that 
would prevent the fumes from drifting into the nearby residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A jubilant Zapple, who claimed that his home and environment had been harmed by 
foul-smelling gases from the landfill, hailed the decision and said that as 
many as 100 more Kagel Canyon residents may file similar small claims suits in 
order to bring pressure on the Bureau of Sanitation to close the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Binding on Others 
</P>
<P>
Keimach pointed out, however, that Zapple's victory "means absolutely nothing 
on future lawsuits, because it is not binding on any other judges or on any 
other cases I might hear." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, 116 homeowners near the San Francisco Airport filed small claims 
lawsuits against the city of San Francisco, claiming that noise from the 
airport caused them undue suffering. They won damages, prompting more lawsuits 
from other neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Zapple said, their efforts led officials to close two runways 
during night hours. 
</P>
<P>
It was a small legal victory for Lopez Canyon opponents on the same day when 
the city won a major legal battle in defense of the dump. A Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge barred state officials from scaling back trash dumping at 
the landfill, saying the state had based its order on a vague and outdated 
document. 
</P>
<P>
But Zapple, carrying on the fight by the dump's neighbors, said he hopes the 
strategy of many small lawsuits will persuade city officials to close the Lopez 
Canyon Landfill rather than expand it, because foul odors "inundate the 
neighborhood on an ever more increasing basis." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that the courts have upheld that the landfill has been 
an ongoing public nuisance, that they are defiling our environment," Zapple 
said. "This is a major victory for our community -- it shows the city cannot 
run willy-nilly over us." 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy City Atty. Chris Westhoff, who represents the Bureau of 
Sanitation, said the bureau will appeal the decision to Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a ridiculous ruling," Westhoff said. "We are obviously going to 
appeal. I have no doubt that we will win." 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that city officials could spend many hours in court if Kagel 
Canyon residents do file many small claims suits. "If they want to spend their 
time doing that, we will spend our time defending it," Westhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2,000 Sought 
</P>
<P>
Zapple won only a fraction of the $2,000 in damages he sought from the city 
because he failed to prove his contention that the fumes were a health hazard 
-- a contention which Bureau of Sanitation engineer Edward Ostrowski denied. 
</P>
<P>
"It has never been shown that Lopez Canyon is a public health hazard," 
Ostrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
However Keimach said he felt Zapple's living conditions had been harmed by the 
fumes, and said he fined officials because "the city had not acted properly" 
after residents began complaining.

DISCLOSING HOMEOWNER MEMBERSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An article about light rail on Sept. 10 quoted Richard Close, president of the 
Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., and Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of 
Encino. Many articles regarding growth issues quote representatives of 
homeowners groups. My difficulty is in understanding whom these various 
representatives represent. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee for the 
Ventura/Cahuenga Specific Plan, I served with Mr. Silver. While one must 
respect his strongly held convictions and his ability to obtain substantial 
press coverage in their furtherance, one must question whether his convictions 
are more his own than those of a community. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true in Encino, where more than one organization claims to 
represent homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring homeowner associations to make public their paid memberships would 
allow the comments of an individual such as Mr. Silver to be given their proper 
weight. Logically, the only homeowner groups that should object to making this 
information public would be those that have limited membership. Imagine the 
difference in importance if Mr. Silver represented 25 households as opposed to 
500 or 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
I also believe that representatives of homeowner groups who actively lobby 
within the city of Los Angeles should be required to register as lobbyists. As 
chairman of the Business Property Council, our executive director, Tim Riley, 
is required to register as a lobbyist prior to speaking on behalf of our 
organization and its membership. This filing is a public disclosure as to our 
organization and its membership. Representatives of homeowner groups should be 
no less regulated when they are performing the same functions.

IT'S BACK TO FUTURE AS ANGEL BID ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still stuck on 89 for '89, the Angels officially began preparations for the 
1990 baseball season Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The American League West championship they gamely pursued for more than five 
months will belong in hands other than the Angels' for the 26th time in 29 
years. Their 4-0 loss to Kansas City at Anaheim Stadium, coupled with Oakland's 
4-3 victory over Texas, equaled elimination for the Angels on the 157th date of 
their regular-season schedule. 
</P>
<P>
And, cruelty upon cruelty, the home run that again torpedoed the Angels was 
delivered by Dave Henderson, the anti-hero of '86, whose two-run shot up north 
was the difference in the Athletics' victory over the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Rubbed out . . . and not spared having it rubbed in. 
</P>
<P>
At 89-68, the Angels are six games behind Oakland with five to play. Only 
Kansas City, which remains five games back, has a mathematical chance of tying 
Oakland for the title. The A's (95-62) have clinched at least a share of their 
second consecutive AL West championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, meanwhile, squandered their fifth consecutive chance to win their 
90th game. Last Wednesday, they logged victory No. 89 and haven't won since, 
going 0-5 against Cleveland and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
After a long and unlikely run -- they were tied for first place as late as Aug. 
21 -- the Angels, in the end, went quietly. And that end left Manager Doug 
Rader unprepared for its reality. 
</P>
<P>
Or, at least, Rader refused to acknowledge it. 
</P>
<P>
"I never anticipate losing and I never anticipate that tomorrow we're not in 
the pennant race," Rader said. "I can't get my mind in the mind set to prepare 
myself for failure." 
</P>
<P>
Rader also refused to look back on the successes experienced by a team that 
most expected to finish no better than fourth with no business winning 90 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"No reflections tonight," Rader said. "Tomorrow there will be. I need some 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill, Tuesday's losing pitcher, reacted much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking back on anything yet," said McCaskill, whose record dropped to 
15-10. "We're still fighting for something, as far as I'm concerned. Second 
place and possibly the second-best record in baseball means a lot, at least to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these things are valuable. We should always have goals. Granted, we're 
not going to win this thing, but nothing was ever accomplished sitting back. 
</P>
<P>
Contention ended rather predictably for the Angels. They were beaten by young 
nemesis -- and AL Cy Young Award favorite -- Bret Saberhagen, who threw a 
six-hitter to improve to 22-6, lower his earned-run average to 2.19 and extend 
his consecutive scoreless-innings streak to 27, a Kansas City record. 
</P>
<P>
By retiring pinch-hitter Jim Eppard on a fly ball to left field to complete the 
shutout, Saberhagen eclipsed Roger Nelson's old Royal mark of 26 2/3 scoreless 
innings, set in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
So, from the Angels' vantage point, what's new? This was Saberhagen's 16th 
appearance against the Angels, and with it, he won for the ninth time in 12 
decisions. He is 2-0 against them this season and 5-1 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Saberhagen is something else," Rader said. "I can't imagine a better pitcher 
-- anywhere -- than him right now. He was throwing 93 (m.p.h.) in the ninth 
inning and still had command of all three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got it all." 
</P>
<P>
Seldom, however, have the Angels made it easier for Saberhagen, who led, 3-0, 
before throwing his first pitch. Angel starter Kirk McCaskill didn't retire a 
hitter until striking out Kurt Stillwell, the No. 7 batter in the Kansas City 
lineup. Before that, McCaskill: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hit leadoff man Kevin Seitzer with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yielded a looping single to left field by Willie Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loaded the bases when George Brett beat out a grounder that skittered away 
from Angel second baseman Johnny Ray. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Surrendered a two-run broken-bat single to Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gave up another infield single, this bouncing off the glove of shortstop 
Kent Anderson, to Jim Eisenreich. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gave up a run-scoring single to left field by Danny Tartabull. 
</P>
<P>
To that point, the only out McCaskill had recorded was at second base, when 
Angel catcher Lance Parrish erased Jackson on a stolen-base try. 
</P>
<P>
So at that point, Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann left the dugout to 
offer McCaskill a few words of advice. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill promptly settled down -- he retired the next 12 hitters -- but by 
then, Saberhagen was entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen was in trouble only once, in the fifth inning, when Lance Parrish 
led off with a single and Jack Howell then hit a double to left field. 
</P>
<P>
With runners on second and third and no outs, Saberhagen got two in a hurry 
when Anderson hit a bouncer to Brett at first base. Brett scooped up the ball 
and stepped on the bag for one out, then watched as Parrish made a belated 
break for home. 
</P>
<P>
On the run, Brett fired an off-balance throw to catcher Bob Boone, who made the 
tag on Parrish for a threat-killing double play. Saberhagen retired the next 
batter, Brian Downing, on a ground ball to shortstop and was out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve outs later, the Angels were also out of time. Five games are left on 
their schedule, but the next one that really counts for anything will be played 
early next April. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
So, what's left for the Angels to play for? With a 4-2 final home stand, the 
Angels would tie the club record for most victories in a season, 93, set by the 
1982 American League West champions. With a 3-3 home stand, the Angels would 
equal the franchise record for most victories at home, 53, set in 1967. . . . 
The Angels' Johnny Ray and Kansas City's George Brett both ended protracted 
batting slumps with first-inning singles. Ray was one for 18 before singling 
off Bret Saberhagen, and Brett was one for 21 before beating out an infield hit 
against Kirk McCaskill. 
</P>
<P>
A'S ASSURED OF TIE

DEYNA DRINKING HEAVILY AT TIME OF FATAL ACCIDENT

Kaz Deyna, a member of five Socker championship teams, had a blood-alcohol 
level twice the legal limit when he crashed into a parked truck and died on 
Sept. 1, the San Diego County Coroner's Office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deyna had a blood-alcohol level of .20%, said Max Murphy, the supervising 
deputy at the coroner's office. California law recognizes .10 as the legal 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be assured that the guy was doing some heavy drinking," said Lloyd 
Needham, a public affairs officer for the California Highway Patrol in San 
Diego. Deyna, 41, had a history of drunk driving. He was convicted three times 
of driving under the influence following arrests on Aug. 7, 1984, May 14, 1987 
and Oct. 29, 1987, according to San Diego Municipal Court records. 
</P>
<P>
For two of the convictions, he was given 180-day jail sentences, which were 
both suspended after two days. His license was temporarily suspended after the 
third conviction, but, according to state Department of Motor Vehicles records, 
he was driving legally at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Deyna, a native of Poland and a member of Poland's 1972 Olympic gold-medal 
team, was pronounced dead at the scene. The accident occurred about 1:25 a.m. 
on Interstate 15 north of Mira Mesa Boulevard. The coroner's report said Deyna, 
who was driving alone, died of massive head injuries. According to the CHP 
report, the hazard lights of the truck, which was parked on the right shoulder, 
were blinking, and there were no skid marks from Deyna's car. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before his death, Deyna was in Europe participating in an all-star 
exhibition game with the Polish national team against Denmark. Juli Veee, a 
former Socker teammate of Deyna's who saw him frequently during the past year, 
said returning from the trip might have depressed Deyna. 
</P>
<P>
"He went back and he was Kaz Deyna the star again," Veee said. "I don't care 
what anybody says, it's tough to lose the notoriety when you're at the top and 
suddenly you're driving down Mira Mesa Boulevard and nobody even knows you." 
</P>
<P>
Veee said he was aware of Deyna's drinking, but that Deyna seemed to have it 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried about the drinking too much, because in Europe a lot of 
players drink," Veee said. "Some people would say 'The hell with him. He was an 
alcoholic.' No, he liked his drinks. He could handle it. He was never drunk in 
the games. I think he knew what his limit was. Maybe this time he just didn't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Deyna, a Socker from 1981-87, publicly expressed his displeasure with the team 
during his final season, when he played sparingly.

MORNING BRIEFING: THESE CUB FANS HAVE SAID IT ALL ALONG: YOU GOTTA BELIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not exactly a cargo cult, but William Branigan of the Washington Post 
reports that residents of the Central American country of Belize are going 
bonkers for the Chicago Cubs: 
</P>
<P>
"Through a quirk of geography and satellite technology, Belize has more Cub 
fans per capita than any place outside greater Chicago, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"It started in 1981, when local businessman Arthur Hoare introduced television 
to Belize (population 180,000), the only English-speaking country in Central 
America. Many Belizeans already had television sets by then, but used them to 
watch rented videotapes. The enterprising Hoare capitalized on the ready market 
by launching Channel 9, which captured Chicago's WGN station on a satellite 
dish and relayed it to local viewers." 
</P>
<P>
Then aren't the broadcasts pirated? 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. broadcasters consider the Belize market so small that trying to stop the 
operations would not be worth the trouble." 
</P>
<P>
According to Branigan, Belizeans take the view that, as one resident put it, 
"Out of the sky we get sunshine, we get rain and we get TV signals. Whatever 
drops out of the sky is an act of God." 
</P>
<P>
Crying wolf: Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, once known for his quick wit, has 
developed a new image -- that of a hand-wringing poor-mouth. 
</P>
<P>
After his top-ranked Irish had defeated Michigan State Saturday, Holtz moaned 
about Notre Dame's next opponent, Purdue. It was his understanding, Holtz said, 
that the Boilermakers had beaten Notre Dame whenever the Irish were reigning 
national champions. Sorry, Lou, no sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC radio's Jim Healy, based on research by sports expert Dwain Esper, 
informed his audience Monday night that in nine seasons after Notre Dame 
championships, Purdue has won three times, the Irish have won three and three 
times the teams didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Sept. 27, 1936, what future Dodger manager played in his only 
major league game? 
</P>
<P>
Strictly business: The Boston Red Sox unceremoniously made it clear Monday that 
former stars Jim Rice, 36, and Bob Stanley, 34, won't be in Red Sox uniforms 
next year. Both are in final years of long-term contracts that included club 
options for 1990. Rice earns $2.34 million for this season, Stanley $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the Red Sox plan to do with the money they save on the contracts, 
General Manager Lou Gorman told Steve Buckley of the Hartford Courant: "A lot 
of it will go to Mr. Esasky, if we can sign him." 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Nick Esasky will become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Walter Alston, as a late-inning substitute at first base for 
Johnny Mize of the St. Louis Cardinals. Alston made one error in two chances 
and struck out in his only time at bat. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray, on the possibility of the 
club's winning the National League East title while playing in Montreal: 
'There's something un-American about clinching a pennant in a foreign country."

CARDINALS LEAVE CHASE WITH WHIMPER, 4-1

The St. Louis Cardinals exited the National League East race with customary 
silence from their bats. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who struggled to overcome injuries all season, were eliminated 
Tuesday night from the race as they lost to Pittsburgh, 4-1, while Chicago beat 
Montreal to clinch the division title. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis' loss clinched a tie for the Cubs, and Chicago finished the job a 
little later with a 3-2 victory over the Expos at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals are 11-43 when they score three or fewer runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't score enough," Manager Whitey Herzog said. "You look at the 
three teams that were in it and faded, it was the same thing. The Mets, 
Montreal and us, we just didn't score enough." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog showed no emotion as the Cardinals' hopes faded. He dug into his usual 
plate of postgame food. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of years when I didn't win it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog pointed to last weekend as the time when the race turned. The Cardinals 
swept the Phillies but gained no ground on the Cubs, who took three games from 
the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the whole key to our chances," Herzog said. "We had to get some help 
there." 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like every time we won, they won," third baseman Terry Pendleton 
said. "We'd lose and they'd lose. And then we didn't help ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals lost 12 of 17 games to fifth-place Pittsburgh this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Patterson (4-2) gave up four hits in eight innings, and Bill Landrum got 
the last three outs for his 26th save. 
</P>
<P>
"If you keep their speed off the bases you have a chance to win," Patterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals stayed close throughout the season despite playing without 
injured starting pitchers Danny Cox and Greg Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla, who has 11 extra base hits and has scored 10 runs in his last 13 
games, tripled and doubled and scored twice for Pittsburgh.

It was a long, tough night for goalie Kelly Hrudey, who gave up four goals 
before he was felled by a puck to the face mask in the third period, and later 
gave up one more goal in the Kings' 6-3 exhibition loss to the Vancouver 
Canucks Tuesday night before a crowd of 12,320. 
</P>
<P>
After the Canucks' first four goals, Mike Krushelnyski scored for the Kings 
with less than two minutes to play in the second period. Vancouver responded 
with another goal, before the Kings made it 5-3 on Krushelnyski's goal from the 
right circle and Luc Robitaille's goal, after Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean made 
a glove save on a shot by Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks later scored on an empty-net goal.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;

<P>
HAVERT A SOFT TOUCH AFTER 6 SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although it might seem ludicrous to the Calabasas High defense, Colin Havert 
claims that he has a soft spot. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are no soft spots on Havert's 6-foot, 200-pound, diamond-hard 
frame. But Chaminade's senior tailback has a soft spot in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Chaminade's final touchdown in a 48-0 thumping of Calabasas last 
Friday hurt him more than it hurt Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
It was his sixth, yes, sixth touchdown of the game. "My last one was sorta 
getting old because I didn't really expect to get back in the game," he said. 
"And when I did it was like, 'All right, here's another one.' I was a little 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
Havert has nothing to be embarrassed about, Coach Rich Lawson says. Havert 
gained 183 yards in 15 carries and scored on runs of two, 33, one, 32, one, and 
26 yards. That places him in a third-place tie for most touchdowns in a 
Southern Section game. The record is eight. 
</P>
<P>
And Lawson insists that this was not a case of pouring it on. Every player on 
the Eagles' roster played and the coach reasoned that keeping Havert in the 
game actually reduced the likelihood of injuries to his offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any depth," Lawson said. "On offense, if guys don't know the 
blocking scheme and they're running back and forth, then you're really going to 
create an injury." 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade had already sustained a major blow, losing All-Southern Section 
defensive back Jeff Burdick, who broke his leg and tore ankle ligaments on the 
fourth play of the game. Burdick, who also starts at receiver, was injured 
after catching a pass. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Havert had to shoulder the bulk of the Chaminade offense. He also 
played linebacker on a defense that limited Calabasas to 111 yards passing and 
30 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Against hard-hitting and heavily favored Palmdale, he scored three touchdowns 
in a 35-14 rout. His performance against Calabasas gives him 379 yards in 50 
carries (a 7.6-yard average) and also earned him recognition as the National 
Football Foundation's Player of the Week for the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The molar-rattling blows Havert took in the Palmdale game prepared him for what 
might have been similar treatment from the Coyotes. Instead, he found open 
space. Lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Calabasas had some real big kids," he said. "I was ready to pound it out and I 
lowered my head. But the holes were wide open every time." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Eagles' offensive line, give credit to Felix Goodson, a 
utility back who alternately spells Havert and fullback Ted Corcoran. Goodson 
noticed a weakness in the Calabasas defense and spied a way to spring Havert 
with a kick-out block on a blitzing linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
The play didn't work on the first try. Havert failed to cut to the sideline 
quickly enough and was tackled after a short gain. 
</P>
<P>
Before Havert's next carry, Goodson drew him the suggested path in the air and 
pointed to the hole before the snap. Havert took the handoff, blasted into the 
gap, squirted to the sideline and ran 42 yards before he was accidentally 
knocked down by a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the 32-yard touchdown run that most impressed Lawson. Starting from 
the right hash mark, Havert took the handoff, juked three times to the left, 
then crossed the goal line at the left corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, not only can this guy bruise but he can cut back," Lawson said. "I've 
been telling people all year that he's really underrated, but like I told 
Colin, 'You just let your feet do the talking.' "

ART BUCHWALD: A TEAMSTER'S GIANT STAKES OUT HIS TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was in all the papers. A mobster told Playboy magazine that Jimmy Hoffa, the 
former Teamster Union boss, was buried on the 20-yard line at the Giants' 
stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
The thug, a government-protected witness, stated that after Hoffa was 
dispatched in Detroit, his remains were placed in an oil drum and shipped east. 
The drum was laid in the soft Meadowlands ground as support for the artificial 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
The news came as a surprise to some sports fans who hang out at Clyde's in 
Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Don Rogers said, "I thought Hoffa was buried on the highway between Grand 
Rapids and Kalamazoo." 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," answered Steve Wells. "A friend of mine assured me his remains were 
under the starting gate at Hialeah. Hoffa liked horses." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Boyd added, "The thing that makes me doubt the Playboy story is that Jimmy 
Hoffa was a Detroit Lions fan. Why would he want to be buried in New Jersey?" 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he didn't have any choice," Jim Norton suggested. "Perhaps they buried 
Hoffa in New Jersey to punish him." 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought of that. Teamster gorillas can be insensitive. But why the 
20-yard line?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers explained, "That's where all the action is. It's much more lively than 
the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Wells was shaking his head. "It just doesn't figure. The Giants are not that 
good a team." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Boyd said, "There could be other factors. Don't forget that at the time 
they buried Hoffa in the Meadowlands Stadium, they were installing artificial 
turf. By burying him there, look at all the money the Teamsters saved on upkeep 
of the grave. The Teamster enforcers are always looking for ways to put a 
little extra into their pension fund." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it possible that the Playboy story is a red herring, and Hoffa is really 
buried in Yankee Stadium at home plate?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't make any sense. Why would they bury him there?" Rogers wanted to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where George Steinbrenner buried 4,600 Yankee managers. So the Mob 
might have thought that no one would look for Hoffa in that location," Wells 
told him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too farfetched. I believe the mobster's story that Hoffa is now in a drum 
in the Giants' ballpark," Boyd declared. 
</P>
<P>
"If that is true, it gives new meaning to the phrase 'sudden death,' " Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what would be nice. If we all went up to the Meadowlands and strewed 
flowers on the Giants' 20-yard line," I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"While they were playing!" exclaimed Norton. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be more touching," Rogers said.

"You've got to show me something other than the Playboy article before I'll 
believe that Jimmy Hoffa is resting in the Meadowlands. He could be anywhere -- 
even under the Dallas Cowboys' locker room," Norton told us. 
</P>
<P>
"They would never bury Hoffa in Dallas," Rogers asserted. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cowboys don't have a pass defense." 
</P>
<P>
There was no consensus at Clyde's that evening on whether or not Hoffa was 
really buried in the Giants' stadium. The problem, as we saw it, was that since 
everything else is buried in New Jersey, why not him?

The Scene: A reception and private preview of 94 works of art from 
director/screenwriter/producer Billy Wilder's collection, which go on the 
auction block Nov. 13 at Christie's New York. The Beverly Hills Hotel's Crystal 
Ballroom was jammed with paintings, people and paparazzi. Picasso's "Head of a 
Woman," which previously hung over the fireplace in Billy and Audrey Wilder's 
apartment, drew intense scrutiny, as it carries the sale's top estimate of $5 
million to $7 million. Not to be missed were paintings by Miro, Balthus, Braque 
and Klee. Wilder was the epitome of cool; he drank a Heineken and mingled. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Art-that-got-away war stories. The Giacometti that could have been 
had for $3,500, but of course that was 30 years ago. Balthuses went for a song 
in the '60s and now look at them. Also, talk about the Wilder estimates. They 
were insane. They were fair. The name alone made people come running. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: A little bit Hollywood, a little bit Hancock Park. From 
Christie's Christopher Burge and Terry Stanfill; also, Robert and Vivian Rowan, 
Cesar Romero and Lee Minnelli, Ann Miller, Tony Bennett, Andy Williams, 
designers David Hayes, Luis Estevez and Gus Tassell, David Begelman, Walter 
Matthau, Jerry and Lois Magnin, Shirley and Isadore Familian, Michael Chow, 
Father Maurice Chase, Norman and Lyn Lear, Marcia Weisman, Tina Sinatra, Nathan 
and Marion Smooke, Wendy Goldberg, Jerry Moss, Joanna Poitier, Jo Ann and 
Julian Ganz, Sammy Cahn, Armand and Harriet Deutsch, Jackie Collins, Maurice 
Tuchman, Henry and Jayne Berger, Marvin and Barbara Davis, Stephanie Barron and 
Robert Rifkind, Ginny and Henry Mancini, Fred and Janet de Cordova, Karen 
Gould, Susan and Peter Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Proverbial cocktail attire, i.e. pearls and pinstripes. David 
Hockney, as usual, made his own fashion statement in chinos, dirty bucks, work 
shirt, blazer and red polka dota bow tie, untied. 
</P>
<P>
The Food: Proverbial hors d'oevres passed on trays, i.e. mushrooms stuffed with 
crabmeat, cold shrimp and cocktail sauce, steak tartare. Open bar. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "I wouldn't be surprised if a year from now I'd buy everything back," 
Billy Wilder announced. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "The joy of collecting is when you see something you like the heart 
goes boom, boom, boom."

<P>

NEW AND USEFUL: POSTER/CABINET CAN KEEP MUSIC BEHIND THE SCENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Arizona company has introduced an inconspicuous way to store compact discs 
and cassettes at your home or office -- in a wall cabinet hidden behind a 
framed poster. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the Scenes Storage Frames are customized metal-framed posters and 
storage cabinet combinations that open to reveal a music storage cabinet, 
similar to a medicine cabinet. The poster "door," which is hinged to the hidden 
cabinet, opens with a magnetic touch release. And the cabinet is constructed of 
melamine-covered, almond-colored particle board. 
</P>
<P>
The poster/cabinet combination, which protrudes only 4 3/8 inches from the 
wall, comes in eight sizes. Available in horizontal and vertical, the smallest 
poster sizes are 18 1/2 by 20 inches; largest, 32 1/4 by 36 inches. 
</P>
<P>
The artwork ranges from museum quality to pop art, from Picasso to Nagel. 
Though there are also many signed, limited edition posters available, customers 
may supply their own posters or original artwork to be made into storage 
cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the Scenes Storage Frames for compact discs can be ordered to hold 36, 
48, 54, 60, 72, 90 or 96 cases. CDs fit in clear acrylic holders -- each stores 
6 -- that give you front viewing, and also swing out for a side view of the 
five CDs behind. 
</P>
<P>
The cabinets for cassettes can be ordered in 63, 84, 93, 105, 124, 126, 155 or 
168 cases and feature shelves to store tapes vertically. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for Behind the Scenes Storage Frames start at $179.95 for CDs; $139.95 
for cassettes. To order, contact Parallel Productions, 919 W. Mission Drive, 
Chandler, Ariz. 85224; phone, (602) 899-8057. 
</P>
<P>
Get a Handle on Grocery Bags 
</P>
<P>
A new handle to help shoppers carry more than one plastic bag at a time without 
hurting their hands is so simple it's a wonder no one thought of it before. 
</P>
<P>
Grocery Tote, designed by Eric Stoft and Bill Cloonan of Sylmar, is a 
heavy-duty blue plastic handle with hooks at each end to keep the shopping 
bags' plastic handles locked in place. Stoft advises shoppers to place the 
heavier bags on the tote handle first, so they can easily balance a large 
number of bags at the same time. The underneath portion of the handle has 
finger grooves to give shoppers a comfortable grip. 
</P>
<P>
Grocery Tote weighs a few ounces, so it's lightweight enough to carry in a 
purse or back pocket. It retails for about $2 and is available at Ralphs 
markets or by mail order from Castech Enterprises, 13145 Bromont Ave., Suite 7, 
Sylmar 91342; phone, (818) 367-4474. 
</P>
<P>
Lean on This 
</P>
<P>
Back pain bothering you? You might want to try a German-built inflatable lumbar 
support cushion that was designed for cars but seems to work just as 
effectively in airplane or train seats, or on office furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Zender Aerodynamiks of North America, based in Anaheim, is offering the durable 
cloth-covered cushion, originally constructed to fit current model Volkswagen 
seats and other high-performance auto seats, for about $38. 
</P>
<P>
The inflation bulb attached to the cushion works like the armband machines used 
to test blood pressure: You turn the valve slightly and pump up the pillow to 
the desired firmness; to deflate it, turn the valvee the other way. 
</P>
<P>
Said a Zender representative, "I use one in my chair at the office for back 
support." 
</P>
<P>
The cushions are available at any of Zender's 2,200 nationwide auto accessory 
dealers. If you don't have one of the company's dealers in your area, contact 
Zender Aerodynamiks of North America, 2267 Via Burton St., Anaheim 92805; or 
call (800) 672-6060 in California, (800) 421-5544 outside California.

<P>
Parenting Advice 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 7, the National Parenting Center, a new 24-hour, seven-day-a-week hot 
line began offering parents expert child-rearing guidance in seven categories 
-- pregnancy, newborn, infant, toddler, preschool, preteen and adolescent. The 
service can be accessed only from touch-tone telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Television director-producer David Katzner, who also runs an independent 
production company in Los Angeles, began working on the concept for the center 
shortly after his daughter Alana, 2 1/2, was born. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly I found myself searching everywhere for information on how to be a 
parent," Katzner explained. "The National Parenting Center was a natural 
extension of my own search for child-rearing information." 
</P>
<P>
Callers to the center will receive child care information from one-minute tapes 
made by nine of the country's top physicians, obstetrician-gynecologists, 
psychologists and authors on subjects ranging from teething to temper tantrums 
to truancy. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to the tape, the caller can cut through to a voice-activated 
response system, which includes the option to leave a question for an expert 
and receive a written opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Cost for calling the center is $1.95 for the first minute; $.95 for every 
minute thereafter. Parents also may buy memberships via phone for $19.95 a 
year, which includes a touch-tone phone, a monthly newsletter with updates on 
new topics, novelties, brochures, and discounts on books and videos. To reach 
the center, call (900) 246-MOMS. LYNN SIMROSS

Willard White, a basso remembered in Los Angeles for appearances with the New 
York City Opera, has recently concentrated his career in Great Britain. His 
repertory has grown to embrace such disparities as Mozart's Osmin, Wagner's 
Wotan and Gershwin's Porgy, a role he has sung in two complete recordings. Now, 
following in the formidable footsteps of Paul Robeson, he has taken the leap to 
the so-called legitimate stage. Trevor Nunn, the director of "Starlight 
Express" and "Les Miserables," has cast White as the Moor of Venice in 
Shakespeare's "Othello" in Stratford-on-Avon. Shauna Snow

A Detroit judge ordered former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin to jail 
because he showed up five hours late for a hearing. Ruffin, who was in court on 
a probation violation charge, was scheduled for a 9 a.m. hearing Monday, but 
when Ruffin, 48, arrived just before 2 p.m., the judge ordered Ruffin to spend 
the night in jail. Monday's hearing was scheduled to decide whether Ruffin 
should undergo drug treatment instead of serving a jail sentence after a drug 
test last week was positive for opiates. Ruffin, 48, was convicted in May, 
1988, for misdemeanor possession of cocaine. Shauna Snow

"Roe vs. Wade," the TV movie about the events that culminated in the 1973 
Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in this country, will be 
released on home video early next year. The NBC-produced movie, which won Emmys 
for outstanding special and for Holly Hunter's lead performance just last week, 
first aired on the network last May. Generally, television movies air twice on 
the network before moving on to home video, but since NBC produced this project 
in house, the network can earn extra revenue from home video sales while 
retaining the rights to broadcast it again. Shauna Snow

FILIPINOS KILL 2 AMERICANS AS QUAYLE ARRIVES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two American civilians working for a U.S. Air Force communications facility 
north of Manila were ambushed and killed by gunmen Tuesday, hours before Vice 
President Dan Quayle arrived amid anti-American demonstrations in this 
increasingly tense capital city. 
</P>
<P>
Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, U.S. and Philippine 
officials said the ambush appeared to be the work of the Communist New People's 
Army, which has killed four Americans here in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials confirmed that they had received threats from the NPA that 
Americans would be attacked if Quayle came to Manila. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators Chant 
</P>
<P>
About 200 demonstrators chanted "Yankee Go Home" and burned a large American 
flag as Quayle's motorcade sped away from Ninoy Aquino International Airport, 
where he arrived at 7:30 p.m. The protesters demanded an end to U.S. military 
bases in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Security officials were bracing for large demonstrations and possible violence 
today as Quayle begins the formal part of his 40-hour visit to the Philippines 
with a call on President Corazon Aquino at Malacanang Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle is expected to give Aquino a letter from President Bush formally asking 
for the opening of negotiations on the future of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay 
Naval Base, America's largest overseas military installations, as well as four 
smaller facilities. U.S. officials said the letter proposes no specific terms. 
</P>
<P>
The bases issue is increasingly divisive here. The Pentagon considers them 
vital to protecting Pacific sea lanes, but many Philippine leaders regard them 
as a reminder of the nation's colonial ties and an affront to national 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The current bases agreement expires in September, 1991. Any new agreement must 
be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the bases 
is strong. Other officials have called for phasing out the bases in five to 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dead Americans Identified 
</P>
<P>
The two Americans killed Tuesday were identified as William H. Thompson, 45, 
and Donald G. Buchner, 44. Officials said both had retired from the Air Force 
and were technicians for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp., a Pentagon 
contractor at Camp O'Donnell, about 60 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Camp O'Donnell is an Air Force communications facility with 135 
employees. They help operate an electronic warfare and bombing range at Clark's 
sprawling Crowe Valley training facility. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a State Department spokesman called the killings "senseless and 
cowardly." 
</P>
<P>
Susan M. Pearce, a vice president at the headquarters of Ford Aerospace Corp. 
in Newport Beach, said the company has "maintained good relations with the 
local Philippine community" and "there is no apparent motive for this attack." 
</P>
<P>
The two victims, both married with children, were among 85 Ford Aerospace 
workers at Camp O'Donnell, Pearce said. She added that there has never been "a 
prior incident of this kind involving our personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark, said early today that 
military personnel and Defense Department employees in the Philippines "are 
being advised to avoid non-essential travel between facilities until further 
notice." The U.S. military television network later announced that Camp 
O'Donnell personnel should not report for work today. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian employees are 
stationed at the two bases, which employ 68,000 Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the two Americans were ambushed at 4:40 p.m. Tuesday 
about 12 miles north of Clark Air Base on a rural highway that connects Camp 
O'Donnell with the town of Capas in Tarlac province. 
</P>
<P>
The Capas police chief, Lt. Pepito Pimentel, said Thompson was driving a Toyota 
Corolla, with Buchner beside him, when a large truck suddenly blocked the road. 
Pimentel said six men armed with M-16 and M-14 rifles opened fire on the 
Americans, riddling them with bullets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
69 Spent Cartridges Found 
</P>
<P>
"We found 69 spent cartridges at the ambush site," Pimentel said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were taken to Clark by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's no doubt it's the NPA," a military officer said early today. 
He speculated that the killers were part of the Central Luzon Regional 
Commission, an New People's Army guerrilla group that killed two U.S. Air Force 
enlisted men and an American civilian outside Clark on Oct. 28, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, on April 21, U.S. Army Col. James (Nick) Rowe, a 
counterinsurgency expert, was ambushed and killed in the Manila suburb of 
Quezon City as he was being driven to his office at the U.S. Joint Military 
Assistance Group. 
</P>
<P>
The NPA said later that it had killed Rowe, 51, a decorated Vietnam veteran and 
former prisoner of war, because of his involvement in the Philippine 
government's "total war" against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks earlier, guerrillas blew up a communications facility operated by the 
U.S. Air Force and Navy and the Philippine military near Baguio in northern 
Luzon. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ambush came after a week of arrests and demonstrations outside the 
U.S. Embassy, a series of shootings and grenade attacks in Manila and a barrage 
of anti-American press reports over alleged meddling in Philippine affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, unidentified gunmen shot and killed a staff officer of President 
Aquino's security command about a mile from the presidential palace. He was the 
fourth member of the presidential guard killed in the last four months. 
Military officials have blamed urban Communist guerrillas -- known as 
"sparrows" for their swiftness -- for the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, 10 students were arrested after demonstrators protesting 
Quayle's visit and rising tuition fees tossed a small homemade bomb at riot 
police on a street across the Pasig River from the presidential palace. Six 
police officers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Manila police and military units have been on the alert for the past two weeks, 
since three grenade explosions killed two people and wounded 16 others. 
Although the attacks remain unsolved, the blasts fueled new coup rumors and 
increased tension. 
</P>
<P>
As Quayle arrived in Manila, leftist student groups chanted "Bases out!" and 
"Quayle go home!" from behind lines of helmeted riot police at the airport 
entrance. Three youths wearing red bandannas over their faces set fire to a 
tattered U.S. flag hung on a pole. Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, were probably 
unable to see the blaze as their car sped by. 
</P>
<P>
"We are against the visit of Vice President Quayle because it is symbolic of 
further intervention by the U.S. in the Philippines," said Noel Medina, 25, an 
organizer of a protest group called Youth for Democracy and Nationalism. "We 
are against the presence of U.S. bases in our country." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will visit the Clark and Subic bases this afternoon after meeting 
congressional leaders and placing a wreath at the U.S. World War II cemetery in 
Manila.

THE SEARCH FOR MINORITY TEACHERS

When Albert Thibodeaux is graduated from Xavier University in New Orleans two 
years from now, recruiters from all over the country will be lining up scores 
deep to offer him a job. Before making his final decision, he will attend 
employment conferences where there will often be more recruiters than students. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects are similar for Lisa Carrasco Laue at Cal State Los Angeles, for 
Sharon Mosely at Norfolk State University and for hundreds of other minority 
students like them. But, paradoxically, few of their fellow students want to be 
in their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Why? They are studying to be school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Among education students, Laue, Thibodeaux and Mosely are a rare breed. Fewer 
and fewer minorities are choosing to enter the teaching profession. The 
consequence is that as the student populations in the nation's schools become 
increasingly black, Latino and Asian, the teaching and administrative staffs 
are becoming increasingly white. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Need 
</P>
<P>
Members of the nation's education community warn that there is a critical need 
for minority teachers. Such teachers, they say, serve not only as role models 
for both minority and non-minority children, but also as cultural mediators 
between minority students and white teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
"No population group has solved all of the problems that students in training 
come across," said Harvard University professor Charles Willie, who has studied 
the impact of largely white teaching staffs on minority students in college. 
"This means a diversified teaching staff gives the learning environment a 
better chance of dealing with the full range of human issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, very fine teachers with the best intentions violate some cardinal 
cultural rules in trying to instruct students which they would not violate if 
they had peers who they could turn to for advice," Willie said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A False Signal 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Elaine P. Witty, dean of the school of education at Norfolk State 
University in Virginia, said the absence of minority instructors can send a 
false signal. "Children look at the composition of the faculty and conclude 
that those people who are white are the people we can look up to for the 
dissemination of information, for being in charge of things, for showing 
authority, making decisions and exerting leadership. That's a dangerous and 
damaging message." 
</P>
<P>
It also means, she said, that "you lose the resource of minority teachers to 
serve as mediators of their culture for other students. For white students, we 
are teaching them a false view of the world. In a world that is not 
predominantly white, they grow up experiencing and seeing a white-controlled 
school system. And, since we live in a global society and most of those are 
people of color, they need to learn there are values and intelligence in a 
variety of cultures and people." 
</P>
<P>
There are a growing number of efforts to reverse the trend and some signs that 
students may be renewing an interest in teaching. And there will be a sharpened 
national focus on public education this week, with President Bush meeting with 
all 50 governors today and Thursday at the University of Virginia for a summit 
conference on the subject. But against this hopeful backdrop, school systems 
that are trying to make their faculties more reflective of society at large are 
finding it increasingly difficult to hire minority teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a problem nationwide," said Ben Lujan, director of certificate 
recruitment and selection for the Los Angeles Unified School District, whose 
teaching staff is nearly 70% white and whose student body is 80% minority. 
</P>
<P>
"Our underlying theme when we go recruiting is that we are vying for minority 
teachers. But we find that universities do not have the minority numbers in 
their programs to serve the needs of the nation's school system." 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, as minority teachers who are now at work reach retirement 
age, the concern becomes more pressing. Currently, minorities make up just over 
9% of all teachers, down from 17% in the mid-1970s. By the turn of the century, 
the National Education Assn. predicts, only one public school teacher in 20 
will be a minority, while nearly one of every three schoolchildren will be 
black, brown or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brief Surplus 
</P>
<P>
A brief oversupply of teachers in the 1970s led to a substantial decline in the 
number of students of all races who went into education schools. But, minority 
enrollment plunged even faster and has remained depressed because of a number 
of other factors, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, they said, the minority teacher shortage is actually a tribute 
to affirmative action and the increased job opportunities for minorities over 
the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was coming out of school, teaching was about all you could do," said 
Lois Pointer, a teacher for nearly 33 years in Memphis where nearly half of the 
instructors are black. "You could be a teacher, a preacher, maybe a nurse or 
work in the post office. Now students have a wide range of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
As students have considered careers that were closed to their parents, they 
have turned away from teaching because of its decreased status and 
comparatively low pay. The average teacher salary in the United States in 
1988-89 was $29,629, according to the American Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I tell people I'm a teacher, they say: 'You couldn't pay me enough money 
to teach,' " said Adriann Wilson, 29, of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, minority students are steered away from the profession. Wilson 
recalls that nearly every teacher she had at Melrose High School urged her to 
go into another field. 
</P>
<P>
"They said engineering, medicine, business -- anything but teaching," she said. 
"They told me there was no money and too many hassles and too much hard work 
and you don't get paid for the amount of time you put into your schooling 
overall." 
</P>
<P>
Children of teachers are especially likely to hear such words of 
discouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer my children to try something else," said Doris Buchanan, a 
Memphis teacher. "You don't get rewarded for what you do." Both of her children 
are now in college, neither pursuing education as a career. 
</P>
<P>
"I encouraged my son and my daughter not to become school teachers," added Lois 
Gilder, a Memphis teacher whose daughter expects to finish college in the 
spring with a degree in marketing. "Years ago, teachers had the utmost respect 
from the community and the families. Now the teachers seem to be way down the 
ladder on the respect list. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that really bothers me is that everybody seems to be making 
extremely more money than we are, and yet if it weren't for good school 
teachers, they wouldn't be where they are." 
</P>
<P>
She cites the case of her younger brother, who was graduated from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985 and started immediately at Hughes 
Aircraft, making $29,500 annually. After a year, the company sent him to the 
University of Southern California to get his master's degree while continuing 
his pay and cutting his hours in half to allow for school. 
</P>
<P>
"He's now making $32,000 and he's only 28 years old," she said. "My income is 
$34,000 and I have been working 27 years and I have a master's degree plus 45 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
The advent of teacher testing in the early and mid-1980s contributed to the 
drop in minority students in education programs, educators said, because 
minority teachers initially failed the tests at a much greater rate than 
whites. For example, in Louisiana in 1981 only 21% of black teachers passed 
examinations compared to 78% of whites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue Disappears 
</P>
<P>
Testing has disappeared as an issue, but it exerted a "chilling effect on 
minority teacher enrollment," said Antoine Garibaldi, dean of arts and sciences 
at Xavier. "Lots of students turn away from teaching because the feeling was 
that even after you got through everything else, you might not be able to get 
by the test, so why bother." 
</P>
<P>
Another major reason for the decline is particularly disturbing to many 
educators: while a larger percentage of blacks and Latinos are finishing high 
school, a smaller percentage are attending college. According to the American 
Council on Education, 20% fewer black high school graduates enrolled in college 
in 1985 than in 1976. During the same period, 25% fewer Latino high school 
graduates enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Educators say that the reason has to do with money. As grants and aid for 
college education declined, minority students, most of them first-generation 
college prospects, simply couldn't afford school. That trend is particularly 
disturbing for education schools because teachers are usually first-generation 
college students, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally persons who have gone into teacher education have been persons who 
come from the lower middle class and it's the first time for the family into a 
profession," said Dr. Eugene Eubanks, professor for education and urban affairs 
at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
At the School of Education at Norfolk State University, Witty says, "The 
largest percent of my enrollment of black students are first generation 
college-goers and I have a larger percentage of first generation college-goers 
than any other school at the university. If we could get more students in the 
school, we'd get our share of teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Mosely and Thibodeaux are first-generation college students, as, they said, are 
many of their fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of minority college students going to other professions has 
increased and the percentage of minority students attending college has 
declined, minority enrollment in education schools has spiralled downward 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Predominantly black colleges, which have produced over half of the nation's 
black teachers, saw their education school enrollments drop from 25% of the 
student body in 1977 to less than 10% today. In Louisiana, the number of black 
students who were graduated from teacher education programs fell by two-thirds 
from 1976 to 1983. Norfolk State, which averaged 250 black education graduates 
annually in the 1970s, produced only 78 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the nation's school systems find themselves scrambling for their 
share of minority teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real competitive," said Dr. Michael Acosta, head of administrative 
personnel for the Los Angeles school system. "Our recruiters have gone all over 
the country. We've gone all over the South, gone to the career fairs, gone to 
large urban cities where there are large populations of blacks and Latinos. We 
advertise in journals. We use Spanish-language publications. Our recruiters end 
up meeting at the same places all the time." 
</P>
<P>
It's so bad, said Linda Sumners, director of hiring for the Fulton County Board 
of Education just outside of Atlanta, that during a recent recruitment 
conference at Florida A&amp;M in Tallahassee there were 120 recruiters and only 
50 students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a student walks through the door and you jump on them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopeful Signs 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a few hopeful signs have begun to appear. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, educators are beginning to design programs that encourage 
youngsters to become teachers. The Los Angeles school system, for instance, in 
1985 began the Teachers Training Academy, a magnet program at Crenshaw High 
School for students interested in pursuing the teaching profession. It has 
become a model for other school systems, such as Washington, D.C., and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has been a mistake on all of our parts not to promote teaching as a 
career," said Jewell Boutte, principal of Crenshaw. "Educators have a 
responsibility for encouraging children to go into education." 
</P>
<P>
The American Council on Education reports that the percentage of minority high 
school students enrolled in college is beginning to creep back up. Teachers' 
salaries are up significantly in some areas -- Los Angeles teachers won a 24% 
increase in their new three-year contract and Rochester, N.Y., teachers can 
earn up to $70,000 -- and many schools are pushing teaching as an interim, 
rather than a lifelong, profession. 
</P>
<P>
"Teaching is not going to be a lifetime career that it has been for the 
majority of individuals who are in the profession today," Garibaldi of Xavier 
said. "The idea is that many students will teach for awhile and then go on to 
other professions." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some colleges report a changing attitude among students that could 
mean more will enter teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Teaching has been hard to sell, particularly at a time of the 'me' 
generation," Witty said. "We're finding that those who are going into teaching 
have almost a Peace Corps mentality. They are going forth to serve." 
</P>
<P>
Thibodeaux, 20, a social studies education major, and Mosely, 27, a former 
justice administration major, reflect that new attitude. "I felt that there was 
a need particularly for black male teachers," said Thibodeaux, who wants to 
teach in his hometown of New Orleans. "I went to an all-male Catholic high 
school. My most influential teachers were black men. I found this throughout my 
educational career, that my most influential teachers were black teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Mosely said she had heard the arguments that her salary would lag behind those 
in other professions, but after two years of substitute teaching in the 
Virginia Beach school system she found her enjoyment of teaching was more 
important than the money she would earn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the kind of person who makes decisions for herself," she said of those 
urging her to pursue another profession. "What really makes up the difference 
for me is seeing the children progress. That's like getting paid all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE GRADUATES RECEIVING TEACHING CERTIFICATES 
</P>
<P>
The number of college graduates receiving teaching certificates has declined, 
as has the percentage of such graduates within each major ethnic group.

FILIPINOS KILL 2 AMERICANS AS QUAYLE ARRIVES

<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, who arrived amid anti-American demonstrations here 
Tuesday night shortly after suspected Communist rebels killed two American 
employees at a U.S. military base, today condemned the killings as "cowardly 
murders" that were linked to his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, U.S. and Philippine 
officials said the bloody ambush appeared to be the work of the Communist New 
People's Army, which has assassinated four other Americans in the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials confirmed that they had received threats from the NPA that 
Americans would be attacked if Quayle arrived here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Are Sickened' 
</P>
<P>
"It should go without saying that these cowardly murders deserve the strong 
condemnation of all civilized men and women," Quayle told a breakfast meeting 
with business groups. "The people of the Philippines, like the people of the 
United States, are sickened by the acts of vicious terrorists who wish to drown 
freedom in the blood of innocent men and women. 
</P>
<P>
"The killings unfortunately were timed to my visit," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The two slain Americans were identified as William H. Thompson, 45, and Donald 
G. Buchner, 44. Officials said both men had retired from the Air Force in 1987 
and were technicians for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp., a Pentagon 
contractor at Camp O'Donnell, about 60 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Susan M. Pearce, a vice president at the headquarters of Ford Aerospace Corp. 
in Newport Beach, Calif., said the company has "maintained good relations with 
the local Philippine community" and "there is no apparent motive for this 
attack." 
</P>
<P>
The two victims, both married with children, were among 85 Ford Aerospace 
workers at Camp O'Donnell, Pearce said. She added that there has never been "a 
prior incident of this kind involving our personnel." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communications Facility 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Camp O'Donnell is a sophisticated military communications 
facility with a U.S. Navy radio transmitter, an embassy radio relay station, 
and an Air Force electronic warfare system for Clark's sprawling Crowe Valley 
bombing range. O'Donnell has about 135 military and civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle also met briefly with the widow of an officer of President Corazon 
Aquino's palace guard, who was killed in a separate ambush earlier Tuesday 
about a mile from the presidential palace. Quayle blamed the New People's Army 
for his death as well. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 demonstrators chanted "Yankee Go Home" and burned a large American 
flag as Quayle's motorcade sped past the entrance to Ninoy Aquino International 
Airport when Quayle arrived Tuesday evening. The protesters demanded an end to 
U.S. military bases in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Security officials blocked streets and kept demonstrators far from the vice 
president this morning as Quayle began the formal portion of his 40-hour visit 
to the Philippines with a wreath-laying ceremony and a 40-minute meeting with 
President Corazon Aquino at Malacanang Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle presented Aquino with a letter from President Bush formally asking to 
open negotiations over the future of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, 
America's largest overseas military garrisons, and four smaller facilities. The 
one-page letter asked that talks begin by December but offered no specific 
terms, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bases issue is increasingly divisive here. The Pentagon considers the 
installations vital to protecting Pacific sea lanes and preserving stability in 
the region. But many Philippine leaders regard them as a vestige of the 
nation's colonial ties to the U.S. and an affront to national sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The current contract for the bases expires in September, 1991. Any new 
agreement must be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition 
to the bases is strong. Other officials have called for phasing the bases out 
in five to ten years. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, a State Department spokesman denounced the killings 
of the two Americans as "senseless and cowardly." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark Air Base, said early today 
that military personnel and Department of Defense employees in the Philippines 
"are being advised to avoid non-essential travel between facilities until 
further notice." The U.S. military television network later announced that Camp 
O'Donnell personnel should not report for work today. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian employees are 
stationed at the bases. They also employ 68,000 Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the two Americans were ambushed Tuesday afternoon about 12 miles 
north of Clark on a paved rural highway that connects Camp O'Donnell with the 
town of Capas in Tarlac province. 
</P>
<P>
Capas Police Chief Pepito Pimentel said Thompson was driving a Toyota Corolla 
south, with Buckner beside him, when a dump truck suddenly blocked the road. 
Pimentel said six men armed with M-16 and M-14 assault rifles leaped out and 
opened fire on the Americans, riddling them and the car with bullets. The two 
men were found slumped in their seats, with both doors open. "The bodies were 
heavily mangled," Pimentel said. "We found 69 spent cartridges at the ambush 
site." 
</P>
<P>
Capas Mayor Hermes Frias said nothing was taken from the bodies, and the car 
was not ransacked. "This was a well planned ambush," he said. "They knew what 
time the car was passing by." 
</P>
<P>
The assailants fled in a jeepney. An M-16 magazine and live 9-millimeter 
bullets were found in the dump truck. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's no doubt it's the NPA," one Western military official said 
early today. He speculated that the killers were part of the Central Luzon 
Regional Front, an New People's Army guerrilla group that killed two U.S. Air 
Force enlisted men and an American civilian outside Clark on Oct. 28, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, on April 21, U.S. Army Col. James Rowe, a counterinsurgency 
expert, was ambushed and killed in the Manila suburb of Quezon City as he was 
being driven to his office at the U.S. Joint Military Assistance Group. 
</P>
<P>
The New People's Army later said it killed Rowe, 51, a heavily decorated 
Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, for his "direct" involvement in the 
Philippine government's "total war" policy against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks earlier, guerrillas blew up a communications facility operated by the 
U.S. Air Force and Navy and the Philippine military near Baguio in northern 
Luzon. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ambush came after a week of arrests and demonstrations outside the 
U.S. Embassy, a series of shootings and grenade attacks in Manila, and a 
barrage of anti-American press reports over alleged "meddling" in Philippine 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, unidentified gunmen shot and killed Capt. Carlos Daileg, a staff 
officer of President Aquino's security command as he drove his car about a mile 
from the presidential palace. He was the fourth member of the presidential 
guard killed in the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, 10 students were arrested after demonstrators protesting 
Quayle's visit and rising tuition fees tossed a small homemade bomb at riot 
police on a street across the Pasig River from the presidential palace. Six 
police were injured.

A 74-year-old woman who bought 32 of the $1,000 lifetime partnerships at PTL 
said at Jim Bakker's fraud trial in Charlotte, N.C., that she would gladly give 
the money to the ministry again. "I was given the greatest thrill I ever had by 
giving that money," Marjorie Grey of Richlands said after testifying. Grey said 
that she also made a $12,000 down payment on a condominium that was never built 
at PTL's Heritage USA retreat and theme park. Each partnership generally 
entitled a person to three nights and four days lodging at Heritage USA. 
Prosecutors contend the partnerships greatly outnumbered the rooms available.

The Yugoslav republic of Slovenia defied federal authorities and vowed to give 
itself the right to secede. Communist Party leaders in Slovenia, a small 
republic of 2 million, said they will adopt amendments to their republic's 
constitution declaring that it can split from Yugoslavia by referendum. 
Yugoslavia's federal Communist Party leaders went into emergency session in 
Belgrade to discuss the crisis, the biggest threat to the country's unity posed 
by a single republic since the Communist takeover in 1945.

Citing a lack of evidence, a Colombian judge dropped charges against two 
reputed leaders of the Medellin drug cartel accused in the assassination of 
Colombia's attorney general and a kidnaping, a leading Bogota newspaper 
reported. The two -- Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha -- are being 
sought by U.S. authorities. The judge's action in Colombia apparently would not 
prevent their extradition. Meanwhile, in Washington, the White House announced 
that Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas will meet with President Bush on 
Thursday on his way to New York to address the United Nations.

Contending that his clients want a "level playing field," a lawyer representing 
seven white San Francisco police officers filed a "reverse discrimination" suit 
to obtain "a colorblind and sex-blind opportunity to advance." In the Superior 
Court complaint, attorney Robert E. Gyemant claimed that less-qualified 
minority officers have been promoted in order to meet "racial quotas" set a 
decade ago by a court-ordered affirmative action plan. The suit contended that 
California has violated state civil rights laws forbidding the use of race or 
sex as a basis in hiring and promotion. City Atty. Louise Renne said the suit 
is "plowing old ground." The suit may be the first test case for a landmark 
U.S. Supreme Court decision that reversed 20 years of affirmative action gains. 
That decision permitted a legal challenge to a court-ordered affirmative action 
plan, or consent decree, which previously could not be challenged in court.

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected an Egyptian proposal for 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo, saying it would amount to Israel's 
surrender. In a sharply worded speech to business executives in Jerusalem, 
Shamir said it is clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization would 
appoint the Palestinian delegates to such talks. "Who will come to Cairo? The 
leaders of the intifada (uprising) will come. . . . They will come as victors, 
they will tell the whole Arab world, 'We succeeded, we succeeded,' " Shamir 
said. Egypt has offered to host Israeli-Palestinian talks on Israel's proposal 
for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to choose delegates to 
negotiate for self-rule.

The judge in the case of a black teen-ager killed by a gang of white youths in 
the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn denied a request that bail be set for 
accused triggerman Joseph Fama. "My gut reaction tells me not to let him out," 
said state Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens as the victim's family and 
supporters applauded. Owens quickly ordered quiet. Fama, 18, has been in 
custody since he surrendered in Oneonta, N.Y., Aug. 31. He and four others are 
charged with murder in the Aug. 23 shooting death of Yusuf Hawkins, 16.

A mother jailed for more than two years in a bitter child custody dispute said 
her daughter is fine. Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who was released from the District 
of Columbia Jail on Monday, said on WUSA-TV: "Two years ago, (my daughter) was 
a terrified, traumatized victim of incest. Today she is a proud, happy girl who 
knows she is worth protecting, and I am very proud of her." Morgan was jailed 
in August, 1987, after she failed to produce Hilary, now 7, for a supervised 
court-ordered visit with her father, Dr. Eric Foretich. Morgan claims Foretich 
sexually abused the child; Foretich has denied the allegation. Morgan's release 
was the result of a law passed by Congress and signed by President Bush last 
week limiting civil contempt jail terms in the District of Columbia to 12 
months. Foretich, appearing on ABC's "Good Morning America," said: "I would 
have been in support of that bill if the bill had a provision mandating a 
government agency such as the FBI be required to find my daughter."

Vandals damaged the remains of a 13th-Century Carmelite monastery in northern 
Israel, apparently to protest a controversial Carmelite convent at the 
Auschwitz death camp in Poland, an Israeli official said. Shalom Yankelevitch, 
commissioner of antiquities for the city of Haifa, said the vandalism followed 
reports that Jewish religious extremists had threatened Carmelite nuns working 
at the monastery. A group of American archeologists and nuns has been 
excavating for two years at the one-acre site on biblical Mt. Carmel. Roman 
Catholic leaders agreed to move the convent away from Auschwitz to an 
interfaith center after some Jews said its presence at the camp was offensive.

SHE'S MADE IT FROM SHELTER TO STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After living a year in an Oxnard homeless shelter, Lupe Vasquez will see a 
fantasy turn real today when she starts classes at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old daughter of itinerant farm workers, Vasquez had been living at 
Zoe Christian Center with her parents and four brothers and sisters since they 
were evicted from their one-room apartment a year ago for failure to pay rent. 
Her mother and stepfather had come to Oxnard to pick lima beans. Now, her 
stepfather works as a janitor at the shelter, which is trying to find low-cost 
housing for the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I can remember, we've been poorer than poor," Vasquez said. "I 
would think the only way out is to get married. The only other way, my mother 
would tell me, is through education." 
</P>
<P>
She took her mother's advice to heart. Vasquez always was at the top of her 
class, even during a childhood spent moving with her family as they followed 
the harvests in Arizona and California. 
</P>
<P>
And this week she became a student at California's most expensive university. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez acknowledges that many people think she will feel awkward at Stanford, 
where yearly costs top $21,000 and freshmen are as likely to have $2,000 
computers as they are to have notebooks. But she shrugs off the school's 
country-club image. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there and everybody's normal," she said. "There are a lot of people like 
me up there." 
</P>
<P>
Her bangs teased high and her friendship bracelet wound tightly around her 
right wrist, Vasquez wears stone-washed jeans artfully ripped along the knees 
and back thighs. Her L.A. Gear high tops are tied with pink and white laces and 
she has pinned Stanford insignia on her bright green tank top. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gets Grants, Scholarships 
</P>
<P>
She has assembled a collection of state, federal and university grants and 
scholarships. The homeless shelter gave her a donated blue 1980 Datsun 510 and 
$1,000 in spending money. She worked 20 hours a week last year to replace the 
hand-me-down clothing that she said once marked her as poor. 
</P>
<P>
She has an outstanding academic record, but she is no prodigy. Teachers at 
Oxnard High School, where she graduated second in a class of 397 last June, 
cite her intelligence and hard work rather than any extraordinary creativity or 
dazzling genius. 
</P>
<P>
"She had the basic tools to start with and the work ethic along with that," 
said Paul Orseth, her teacher in honors classes in economics and government. 
</P>
<P>
These qualities served her well. She racked up so many scholarships and honors 
that senior awards night was jokingly dubbed "Lupe Vasquez Night," according to 
the school's principal, Ruperto Cisneros. "Students had to come up an aisle to 
accept the awards, and we told Lupe she wore out the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
Citing privacy laws, Stanford admissions officials declined to discuss Vasquez. 
But other officials there said she probably was the first homeless person to 
attend the prestigious university. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, but I would be really surprised if there had been other homeless 
here," said Juan Yniguez, Stanford's assistant dean of student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chihuahua, Mexico, Maria (Lupe) Vasquez was 2 years old when her 
parents divorced. Her mother, an itinerant onion picker, moved Vasquez and her 
sister in and out of a series of cramped apartments in small towns near 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother remarried five years ago, and had three more children. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, the family of seven squeezed into a boarding room, which 
accommodated only three beds and a table, in the worst section of town. 
</P>
<P>
Children were not allowed there, so every time the family heard the landlord 
coming up the steps, they clambered out the back way and hid in abandoned cars 
behind the apartment house. This went on almost every day, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Relief at First 
</P>
<P>
Moving to the homeless shelter, where she could count on a bed and regular 
meals, was a relief at first, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But throughout her senior year, Vasquez lied to classmates about where she 
lived, preferring to say that she was from La Colonia, the barrio in town. 
</P>
<P>
When she and her sister prepared to walk the two miles to Oxnard High School, 
Vasquez would peer around the corner to make sure the bus that daily passed the 
shelter on its way to a competing high school was not in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel uncomfortable for people to know that I live here," Vasquez said. "It's 
not that I'm embarrassed, but I feel uncomfortable with speaking of my mom 
working in the fields and being homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Zoe Christian Center, on the other hand, is eager to talk about Vasquez's 
success, and even has enlisted her for speaking appearances in its perennial 
battle for donations. 
</P>
<P>
"Lupe is the culmination of 11 years of working with the poor, and we finally 
strike gold," said the Rev. Jim Gilmer, the center's director. "Lupe was such a 
blessing to us." 
</P>
<P>
But Vasquez is the first to acknowledge that her success was not driven by 
altruism. 
</P>
<P>
Excelling in school was at first a way to prove she was as good as the 
youngsters in her classes who could afford trendy clothes and personal 
computers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they would try to put me down because I'm Mexican and poor. I 
thought they'd think I wasn't as good," Vasquez said. "I thought, 'I'm going to 
do better than everybody.' " 
</P>
<P>
But college remained a fantasy -- along with her almost-constant dreams of 
being rich enough to have a chauffeur and maids and a mansion -- until her 
junior year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of a math and science club for minorities, she learned that 
chances were good she could get financial aid. No one had ever told her about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
She said she "killed herself" her senior year, studying three or four hours a 
night in the pandemonium of the shelter to get ahead in her four honors 
classes. She joined clubs to beef up her college applications. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she returned to the shelter at night. 
</P>
<P>
With other residents, she did assigned chores such as cleaning the bathrooms 
and helping cook meals. Later, sitting on the couch in the center's conference 
room, she tried to do her homework, tuning out the sounds of the pick-up 
basketball games outside and ignoring center residents wandering in and out. 
</P>
<P>
The center houses about 130 people, 60 of whom are children under the age of 
12. 
</P>
<P>
Women share one bathroom and a group shower. Men use two light-green portable 
toilets. Meals are eaten in a cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the best place I've ever lived in," Vasquez said. "If you come at the 
right time and God's with you, you get a room." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accepted by Six Schools 
</P>
<P>
But in her senior year, she was intent on getting a room elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
She applied to six colleges, including Stanford, and was accepted by all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said she has chosen to live in Ujamaa House, the black "theme house" on 
campus, so she can learn about other cultures. She plans to major in 
engineering and then go on to graduate school for her Ph.D. -- jamming in 
somewhere along the way the social life she denied herself in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to have my freedom," Vasquez said. "I want to have fun."

DEUKMEJIAN SIGNS DISABILITY BENEFIT INCREASE, REFORMS 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian signed legislation Tuesday to boost disability benefits 
for injured workers by 50% while beginning what lawmakers expect to be a 
years-long job of overhauling California's $8-billion workers' compensation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The two bills were described as a bipartisan compromise hammered out by 
legislators mediating among several of the Capitol's most combative 
special-interest groups: employers, labor, insurers, doctors and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7-Year Logjam 
</P>
<P>
By signing the bills, Deukmejian ended a seven-year legislative logjam that 
began when the Republican governor was elected in 1982 and declared that 
injured workers would get no benefit increases until the Legislature agreed to 
reforms of the system sought by employers and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum benefits, frozen at $224 weekly since 1983, will increase to $336 
by 1991 for workers who suffer on-the-job injuries after the legislation takes 
effect on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"This legislation . . . will help to restore some balance and fairness to our 
worker compensation system," Deukmejian said before signing the bills at a 
ceremony in his office. "It is going to provide additional, much-needed 
benefits for injured workers in California. At the same time, it is also going 
to bring about some reforms in the system to make it more cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), who wrote one of the bills and led 
months of public and private negotiations on the issue, said the outcome 
represents an "enormously significant victory" for workers and employers. 
</P>
<P>
"These two bills together will help put a crumbling, widely disrespected system 
back on its feet," Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin said the benefit increase would be funded by "squeezing waste and 
fraud out of the system" and by speeding the processing of claims filed by 
injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the benefit increase, organized labor and lawyers who represent 
injured workers agreed for the first time to limit "doctor shopping" -- the 
practice of workers having free choice of physicians to evaluate their 
injuries. The legislation also will limit the ability of workers to collect 
disability payments for stress-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The bills also revamp the vocational rehabilitation system, which employers and 
insurers have criticized as wasteful, and implement a new system for 
arbitrating disputed claims before they reach the courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Panacea' 
</P>
<P>
Despite the widely acclaimed gains, representatives of every interest group 
involved in the issue conceded that more needs to be done before the workers' 
compensation system is returned to satisfactory condition. They said they will 
continue to push for the elements of a compromise endorsed by Deukmejian 
earlier this year, which would have doubled workers' benefits while 
implementing more dramatic changes in the way the system is run. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is not a panacea," said Joseph Markey, a lobbyist for Californians 
for Compensation Reform, a coalition of employers and insurers. "I think it was 
as good a settlement as we could come to, given the pressures of the various 
interest groups, the politics and the timing." 
</P>
<P>
John F. Henning, secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, said 
the 50% benefit increase only "whetted the appetite" of the state's workers for 
higher disability payments. 
</P>
<P>
"We want more," he said, adding that organized labor would be willing to accede 
to additional employer-demanded reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Live With It 
</P>
<P>
Donald Green, a lobbyist for the applicant attorneys, who represent injured 
workers, said the lawyers are not satisfied with the final product but "in good 
faith we are going to have to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Green said the lawyers -- who are in almost constant battle with insurance 
companies -- want to see more done to reduce the cost of workers' compensation 
insurance, which every California employer is required to provide. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin acknowledged that benefits need to be still higher and that more 
changes probably are needed in the administration of the system. But he 
predicted that it will be at least three years before all of the parties return 
to the negotiating table for serious talks. 
</P>
<P>
The governor also took action on these bills: 
</P>
<P>
Therapist sex -- Signed a measure by Sen. Daniel E. Boatwright (D-Concord) to 
make it a criminal offense for a psychiatrist, psychologist or marriage 
counselor to have sex with a patient. 
</P>
<P>
Foam food containers -- Vetoed a measure by Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese 
(D-San Jose) that would have prohibited the manufacture, distribution and sale 
of any rigid polystyrene foam food service product or food packaging made with 
a chlorofluorocarbons. In a veto message, Deukmejian said the food packaging 
industry has already voluntarily eliminated 99% of its use of these chemicals, 
which are thought to be contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Professional wrestling -- Signed legislation by Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd 
(D-Carson) to remove professional wrestling from the jurisdiction of the State 
Athletic Commission. Floyd argued that pro wrestling is entertainment, not a 
sport, and is not in need of government supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Auto body parts -- Signed a bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) to 
require auto body shops to disclose the type of parts that will be used to 
repair damaged motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Farm products -- Signed a measure by Areias to allow fresh California-grown 
farm products to carry a special seal to increase consumer awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Vet loans -- Signed legislation by Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Norwalk) to 
increase the maximum value of a Cal Vet home loan from $90,000 to $125,000. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
HOW THE LAW AFFECTS INJURED WORKERS 
</P>
<P>
Here is a summary of how the changes in California's workers' compensation 
system will affect workers injured on or after Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Benefits: Temporary disability and total permanent disability payments will 
increase from the current maximum of $224 weekly to $266 weekly on Jan. 1, 1990 
and $336 on Jan. 1, 1991. The minimum benefit for most workers, now $112 
weekly, will change to $126 or 100% of the injured worker's average weekly 
earnings, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
Payments for partial permanent disability will increase from $140 weekly to 
$148 for workers who are 25% disabled or more. Maximum benefits will be paid 
for 694 weeks, up from the current maximum of 619 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Death benefits for dependents will be boosted to a maximum of $115,000 from the 
current $95,000, and the maximum payment for burial expenses will go to $5,000 
from $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Evaluating injuries: Workers not represented by lawyers will choose a doctor to 
evaluate their injuries from a panel of three physicians selected at random by 
the state from a pool of qualified doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Workers who do have a lawyer will be required to seek agreement with their 
employer on a doctor to evaluate their injuries. If they cannot agree, the 
worker will choose the evaluating physician but will be limited to one 
employer-paid doctor from each medical specialty. The employer also will be 
limited to hiring one physician from each specialty to rebut the conclusions of 
the doctor retained by the worker. 
</P>
<P>
Stress claims: A worker seeking benefits for a psychiatric injury will now have 
to prove that at least 10% of the injury was caused by an actual event in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Vocational rehabilitation: Injured workers will meet with a vocational 
rehabilitation counselor within 90 days of their injury, and the counselor will 
meet with the worker's physician to speed determination of whether the employee 
can return to his or her occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Workers will be presumed eligible for vocational rehabilitation one year after 
they are injured. 
</P>
<P>
Once a worker is eligible for rehabilitation, he or she will have 90 days to 
apply. After that point, the employer is no longer obligated to provide the 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Employees in vocational rehabilitation will continue to receive temporary 
disability benefits, but not at the increased rates other workers will get 
under this legislation. Vocational rehabilitation participants will get a 
maximum of $247 per week.

POINDEXTER TO SUBPOENA REAGAN, BUSH IN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN DIARIES

John M. Poindexter will subpoena former President Ronald Reagan and President 
Bush in an attempt to obtain their diaries and notes, the former national 
security adviser said in court papers released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, who is facing a criminal trial next year in the Iran-Contra 
scandal, said that he needs the records for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Former President Reagan believes that his diaries and notes are 'personal' 
records," Poindexter said in the papers filed late Monday and made available 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"President Reagan's 'personal' diaries and notes remain in the former 
President's possession and were not transferred to the National Archives" when 
he left the White House, the court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter's lawyers said in court on Sept. 6 that Reagan's notes will reflect 
that he authorized some activities for which the former national security 
adviser was indicted in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter said vice presidential records at the National Archives have yet to 
be processed and that, to date, no personal diary from Bush's tenure as vice 
president has been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter asked that U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene set a pretrial 
return date for subpoenas of presidential and vice presidential records and 
personal records of Reagan and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The former national security adviser is charged with one count of conspiracy, 
two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false statements in 
the Iran-Contra affair.

ATTEMPT TO SAVE CATASTROPHIC CARE FALTERS AS GOP REFUSES TO SUPPORT BENTSEN 
PLAN 
</P>

<P>
Senate Finance Committee efforts to save Medicare's controversial catastrophic 
care program broke down in disarray Tuesday, as Republicans refused to support 
a rescue plan proposed by Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex), the panel's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen has refused to push his program through the Democratic-controlled 
committee without strong support from both Senate Republicans and the White 
House. Without bipartisan backing, Bentsen said, it will be impossible to 
prevent total repeal of the catastrophic program, passed overwhelmingly by 
Congress just a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't win (stop repeal) on the Senate floor unless we have bipartisan 
support," Bentsen told reporters after abruptly canceling a scheduled Finance 
Committee meeting without taking any action on his rescue plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls for Compromise 
</P>
<P>
"We have to face up to the fact that compromises have to be made to get a 
majority," he said. "I wish the Administration had some influence with (GOP) 
members. Although they say they are for the core benefits, they don't show me 
they have any votes on their side." 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen said that the core of the catastrophic care program -- financial 
assistance for beneficiaries with substantial hospital and doctor bills -- can 
be preserved while cutting the surtax on senior citizens that furnishes most of 
the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic committee members generally back Bentsen's plan to sharply 
reduce the unpopular surtax, which is to be paid by the 40% of Medicare 
beneficiaries who pay federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bentsen's proposal, the surtax rate would drop to 10% from 15% of a 
beneficiary's federal income tax liability and the maximum surtax would fall to 
$400 from $800. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage of prescription drugs, which is scheduled to apply to all medications 
in 1991, would instead be restricted to drugs used intravenously and compounds 
used after transplant operations. And the coverage for skilled nursing care 
would be returned to its previous level by again requiring that the beneficiary 
must have spent the three previous days in a hospital. Before the three-day 
requirement was eliminated on Jan. 1, relatively few people qualified for the 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The surtax has generated a storm of opposition from senior citizens, who have 
converted congressional enthusiasm for the program into a stampede for its 
revision or repeal. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen and his allies on the committee still strongly advocate catastrophic 
care, and they are trying to devise the best strategy to withstand repeal 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic members are quite supportive," he said. "As far as making it 
bipartisan, I don't see that." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has said officially that it prefers not to make any 
changes in the program but would support action by the committee. This 
hands-off position is unacceptable to Bentsen, who wants Republicans to share 
the political risks of attempting to preserve the catastrophic care 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
If Bentsen is to succeed in his efforts to prevent repeal of the bill, Sen. 
Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) noted, he needs "to have Democrats and Republicans 
and the President in the boat with him." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger, who is pushing a rival plan with a maximum surtax of about $250, 
was more optimistic than Bentsen about reaching a bipartisan compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting closer," he said. "It's like trying to get down from a 10-story 
building. We've reached the fourth story and we're working our way down." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans on the committee are split, with some, like Durenberger, pushing a 
scaled-down program, some advocating total repeal and others seeking to keep 
full prescription drug coverage under catastrophic care. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen, although clearly disappointed, said that he would meet again privately 
with committee members in an effort to reach agreement on a bipartisan package. 
Meanwhile, the House is moving toward a vote on whether to repeal the 
catastrophic care program entirely. A repeal amendment will be included in the 
debate over the financing of federal government programs for the 1990 fiscal 
year, which begins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The catastrophic care program is the biggest expansion of health benefits for 
the elderly since Medicare was enacted in 1965. It provides unlimited days of 
government-paid hospital care after the patient pays $560 for the first day in 
the hospital.

An East German protest group that mobilized thousands of supporters this week 
in an anti-government demonstration in Leipzig promised Tuesday to continue to 
press the Communist regime for political reform. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, two founders of the New Forum group were ordered by the 
Interior Ministry to stop their reform activities. But on Monday, more than 
5,000 people turned out in Leipzig -- East Germany's second-largest city -- 
singing "We Shall Overcome" and "The Internationale," the Communist anthem. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was described as the largest of its kind in East Germany in 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday, the group said, "We have examined the legal situation 
and have decided to continue New Forum's activities as a political citizens' 
initiative." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist regime has threatened to crack down on the two-week-old group, 
which says it has already signed up 4,200 followers. But no move has been made 
to suppress it. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of New Forum said in East Berlin that their organization has become the 
first major protest group in the country to operate outside the protection of 
Protestant church organizations, which have publicly criticized the Communist 
regime for its inflexibility. 
</P>
<P>
The East German Interior Ministry has called New Forum an "enemy of the state" 
and said it could not be registered as a legitimate organization. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, meanwhile, about 200 East Germans left the West German Embassy after 
Wolfgang Vogel, an East German lawyer who has arranged a number of important 
spy swaps, promised they would be allowed to emigrate to the West. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, other East Germans slipped over the unguarded fence 
into the embassy compound. This kept the number of refugees camping out there 
at about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak border guards have prevented East Germans from fleeing into 
Hungary and thence across the open border with neutral Austria into West 
Germany, but there have been no guards around the embassy in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
In all, more than 16,000 East Germans have made their way to West Germany in 
the weeks since Hungary decided to open its frontier with Austria.

30,000 TONS WOULD BE BURNED AT SITES IN 8 STATES; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. POISON GAS STOCKPILED AROUND COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At least 30,000 tons of lethal nerve gases and mustard gas that would be 
destroyed under the terms of a proposed agreement with the Soviet Union are 
stockpiled at eight sites across the country and one in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
After an extensive study last year, a panel convened by the National Academy of 
Sciences concluded that the best disposal option is to build an incinerator at 
each of the eight sites to burn the chemicals, at a cost that the U.S. Army 
says could exceed $3.5 billion. The only alternative seriously considered was 
transportation of the lethal agents to one or two central sites for burning -- 
an option that was dismissed because of the unacceptably high risks of moving 
the materials around. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, said chemical warfare expert Matthew Meselson of Harvard 
University, incineration is the "only option" for disposing of the obsolete 
chemical weapons that would be covered under the agreement. "We've been working 
toward this for 15 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meselson and other researchers acknowledge that risks are involved in burning 
the agents if it is not done carefully. Even the Army concedes the risks. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any risk-free options," conceded Charles Baronian, technical 
director of the Army's chemical demilitarization program. "All options have 
fairly significant risk associated with them." 
</P>
<P>
But the risks of not burning the agents might be even greater. Already, 
according to Will Collette, national organizing director for the Citizens 
Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes in Arlington, Va., 2% to 5% of the 
containers in which the agents are now stored are leaking. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody involved recognizes that the Army is in a real bind," Collette said. 
"It's too dangerous to leave them sitting there. It's too dangerous to move 
them. The Army simply may not have any choice but to burn them." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the Army's incineration plan has been arising in the communities 
surrounding the storage depots, but even those groups are not opposed to the 
idea of burning the chemical warfare agents -- only to the thought of burning 
them in their own backyards. Most of the thrust of such groups now, Collette 
said, is to ensure that the Army takes adequate safeguards in burning the 
agents and that health and property rights are protected. 
</P>
<P>
None of the storage sites are in California. The eight storage depots in the 
United States are: Tooele, near Salt Lake City, Utah, 42% of the total; 
Umatilla, near Pendleton, Ore., 12%; Pueblo, Colo., 10%; Pine Bluff, near 
Little Rock, Ark., 12%; Newport, near Terre Haute, Ind., 4%; Aberdeen, Md., 5%; 
Lexington-Bluegrass, near Richmond, Ky., 2%, and Anniston, near Huntsville, 
Ala., 7%. An additional 6.6% is also stored outside the continental United 
States, primarily at Johnston Island in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The incinerator at Tooele has been completed, and about 6.2 million pounds of 
chemical warfare agents have been destroyed there in the past two years, 
according to Army Maj. Joel Padilla. Tests of the new incinerator are scheduled 
to begin at Johnston Island within two months, and incinerators are under 
construction at other sites.

WHEELCHAIR PROTESTERS GET SUPPORT BUT NOT BUS LIFTS

Handicapped protesters who occupied a federal building for two days won a 
pledge of government support Tuesday but failed to win an order requiring 
wheelchair lifts on all new public buses bought with federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department "cannot issue a summary order commanding 
immediate access including wheelchair access for all transit," said Steven 
Diaz, chief counsel for the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, who met 
with the protest leaders. "We would if we could." 
</P>
<P>
But Diaz said department officials and the protesters had agreed on three 
points: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner will be urged to meet promptly 
with disabled activists to ensure a "principle of accessibility" until Congress 
passes the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The protesters will be allowed to continue a "symbolic presence" at the 
Richard B. Russell building in downtown Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Officials will relay to Skinner the protesters' concern that new rules for 
handicapped accessibility to air travel are not being drafted quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Not Solved 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement by no means resolves the problem of access; it just brings us a 
step closer," said Mark Johnson, 38, of Alpharetta, one of the protest leaders 
who met with Diaz and other department officials. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know if the protesters would leave the building, where they 
blocked elevators and entrance doors earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We may stay here through Thursday or we may just leave a sticker on the wall. 
There could be a constant vigil at the building or we could all leave," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The protest by members of ADAPT, or American Disabled for Accessible Public 
Transportation, began Monday when Skinner was in Atlanta to address the 
convention of the American Public Transportation Assn. At least two dozen 
protesters chained themselves to doors or blocked exits with their wheelchairs 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities attempted to eject several protesters from the building Monday 
evening but President Bush intervened and let them spend the night inside 
rather than send them out into the rain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entrances Blocked 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the protesters made good on a threat to block entrances to the 
building's main level at noon if their demands were not met by then. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours later, while federal officials met with protest leaders outside 
the building, about 160 chanting, singing activists kept federal employees and 
visitors from using 12 of the 14 main-floor elevators by blocking them with 
wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
Security officers were able to keep two elevators open by using plant stands to 
keep wheelchairs away from them. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 protesters spent Monday night in the building, eating takeout food 
and sleeping under blankets provided by attendants. Early Tuesday, a group of 
Atlanta bartenders brought them coffee and doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an uncomfortable night," said Rick James, 39, of Salt Lake City. "The 
misery that we're going through is worth it if we get what we want. All we are 
asking for is a lift on every bus so that we can be more independent. We're not 
asking for a million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
But government officials have estimated that putting wheelchair lifts on all 
new public buses would cost $90 million a year.

SENATE REJECTS INCREASE IN 'STAR WARS' SPENDING; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET VIEW THAT PLAN WON'T IMPEDE ARMS TALKS MAY HAVE WEAKENED SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Senate dealt a serious blow Tuesday to the "Star Wars" missile defense 
system by rejecting any increase in spending for the program in the fiscal year 
starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the Senate has cast a vote against "Star Wars," a 
missile interceptor program known officially as the Strategic Defense 
Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-34 vote reflected a dramatic deterioration in support for "Star Wars" in 
Congress, apparently hastened by the Kremlin's recent decision to de-emphasize 
the issue of defensive nuclear weapons in U.S.-Soviet arms control 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
By rejecting an increase of $300 million proposed by Sens. Malcolm Wallop 
(R-Wyo.) and John W. Warner (R-Va.), the Senate accepted the decision of the 
Appropriations Committee to set the "Star Wars" spending level at $4 billion, 
or slightly less than this year. And that figure is certain to be cut even 
further in negotiations with the House, which has voted to cut "Star Wars" 
spending to $3.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The action came as a surprise to "Star Wars" supporters, who had anticipated 
that the Wallop-Warner proposal would pass easily and thus strengthen the 
bargaining position of senators in negotiations with the House on a final 
spending figure for SDI. To improve their chances of winning, they had even 
added some increased spending for a number of popular conventional weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Council for a Livable World, a leading anti-nuclear group, hailed the 
surprise vote as "another nail in the 'Star Wars' coffin." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate action virtually guarantees that President Bush will receive less 
money for "Star Wars" in fiscal 1990 than he did in the current year -- the 
first real cut that the controversial program has suffered since it was 
initiated by former President Ronald Reagan six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), a leading "Star Wars" critic, predicted that 
the House and Senate would settle on a figure of $3.6 billion for the program. 
He also predicted that funding would decline in future years, making it 
impossible for the Administration to achieve its goal of deploying a nuclear 
defense system by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just finally running out of enthusiasm for this program," Johnston 
said. "This is just a dose of reality. I am sure that this Congress is going to 
bring this program back to reality." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Support Observed 
</P>
<P>
Even before the vote, senators on both sides of the aisle had observed that 
"Star Wars" was losing its traditional support in Congress as a result of 
recent improvements in U.S-Soviet relations, stiff competition for government 
dollars and what some members view as Bush's lackluster support for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In a floor speech, Johnston argued that the Administration had failed to even 
define the missile defense system, despite the expenditure of $20 billion on 
research since Reagan initiated it. "They cannot to this day tell you what the 
purpose of SDI is or what it will look like," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As proof of the Administration's alleged failure to adequately explain "Star 
Wars," SDI opponents cited a recent statement by Vice President Dan Quayle in 
an interview with The Times. Quayle said that Reagan's original promise of an 
impenetrable shield against Soviet missiles had been nothing more than 
"political jargon." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Johnston argued that the need to fund "Star Wars" had been reduced 
by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's announcement over the 
weekend that Moscow no longer sees U.S. development of "Star Wars" as an 
obstacle to negotiating a treaty reducing the superpower arsenal of strategic 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are not so concerned about SDI anymore," Johnston said. "I think 
it is a recognition of the fact that they are not so concerned about the 
progress we're making" in developing a missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
"They are really not afraid of the program anymore," Johnston later added. 
</P>
<P>
But their strategy clearly backfired, with many Senate members seeming to be as 
opposed to the "sweeteners" as they were to the increase in "Star Wars" 
spending. Furthermore, some senators appeared to be convinced by the argument 
of Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.) that the House would never accept the 
$4.3-billion spending level proposed by Wallop and Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"Voting to put this extra SDI money in here is a complete waste of time," Dixon 
said. "It can't possibly happen." 
</P>
<P>
But the sentiment against added spending for space-age weapons did not extend 
to the controversial B-2 Stealth bomber. Shortly after voting against an 
increase for SDI, the Senate voted, 71 to 29, against a proposal by Sen. 
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) that would have forbidden the Air Force to buy more 
than 13 of the bombers. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also voted, 65 to 34, for a "reassessment" of the current commitment 
of 43,000 troops to South Korea. By accepting this amendment, the Senate turned 
aside a competing proposal by Sens. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) and Johnston that 
would have mandated the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Korea. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in this decade that Congress has considered a proposal to 
limit troop strength in Korea, and supporters of the Bumpers-Johnston proposal 
viewed it as the opening shot in what they expect will be a heated debate on 
the subject over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Bumpers said the United States cannot justify such a costly commitment of U.S. 
troops in the area, especially when the South Koreans are reducing the 
percentage of their own gross national product that they are spending on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"If South Korea is so terrified of North Korea, why don't they spend the money 
to have another 400,000 troops under arms?" he asked. He said they would rather 
rely on "Uncle Sugar . . . Uncle Sucker." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Senate voted, 86 to 14, to reject a plan to reconsider 
the decision of a federal commission to close 86 military bases and to scale 
down five other bases. The base closing decision was based on the Pentagon's 
expressed need to reduce defense spending in future years. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came as Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was threatening to close even 
more military bases to meet future cuts in defense spending imposed on the 
Pentagon by the Democrat-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defense budget to other 
areas, I've got no choice but to find ways to close additional bases," Cheney 
said.

WILSON LETS TV CREW FILM SENATE NEWSLETTER FACILITY

Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who is leading a battle against taxpayer-funded 
congressional newsletters, caused a small ruckus Tuesday by leading a network 
camera crew through the Senate facility where the newsletters are printed and 
mailed. 
</P>
<P>
The televised look at the carefully guarded, seldom-seen mailing operation was 
ruled out of order under Senate rules by the sergeant-at-arms and the Senate 
Rules Committee. The sergeant-at-arms is in charge of Senate security. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has made the anti-newsletter issue a key part of his campaign for 
governor of California, said he took the ABC News camera crew to the facilities 
so that the American taxpayers could see what their tax dollars are funding. He 
said he had been unaware of the Senate rules forbidding such a televised tour. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson's critics accused him of grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Wilson is exploiting this issue for political advantage," said Rep. Vic 
Fazio (D-Sacramento), a defender of the congressional newsletters. "I wouldn't 
be surprised if he got a 30-second television campaign spot out of this one." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's staff said the senator agreed to lead ABC on a tour after Senate 
employees refused to allow the network camera crews to film the mailing 
operation without the sponsorship of a senator. Wilson said he was disappointed 
that a House-Senate conference committee had agreed Monday night to a 
compromise that provided $114 million in fiscal 1990 -- about $84 million of 
that amount for mailings and $30 million to pay for a shortfall in mass 
mailings this year.

STUDENT DRUG USE DROPS BUT USERS OF COCAINE GET HIGHER, SURVEY FINDS

A survey of almost 400,000 junior high and high school students nationwide 
found that the percentage using drugs has dropped in the past two years, but 
those who use cocaine are getting higher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm discouraged that the levels of intoxication are increasing," Thomas J. 
Gleaton Jr., president of National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug 
Education, said Tuesday in announcing survey results. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Bombed in Junior High 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who said they use cocaine dropped 
from 6.4% in 1986-87 to 4.6% in the 1988-89 school year. But those users who 
reported getting "very high" or "bombed/stoned" from the drug rose from 71.4% 
to 74.5% over the two-year period, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
In the junior high grades of 6-8, 1.7% of the students said they had used 
cocaine in the past year, a drop from 2.3% in 1986-87. But 68.2% of those users 
said they got "very high" or "bombed/stoned," contrasted with 65.2% in the 
earlier survey. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in the percentage of students who said they used cocaine "means the 
casual user is more careful, more frightened of the drug," Gleaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the use of beer, liquor, marijuana and cocaine showed declines from 
the 1986-87 survey for students in grades 6-12, levels of junior high students' 
use of liquor and cocaine remained higher than they were in the 1984-85 survey. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of students in grades 6-8 who said they used liquor was 21.2% in 
1984-85, peaked at 26.3% two years ago and dropped to 24.9% in the latest 
survey. The percentage who said they used cocaine was 1.3% four years ago, 
peaked at 2.3% two years ago and dropped to 1.7% in the new study.

In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt summoned all 46 governors of the United 
States to the White House to rally support for an issue he called "second only 
. . . to the great fundamental questions of morality" -- the conservation of 
America's natural resources. The governors lined up wholeheartedly behind the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, just two days after his inauguration, President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
met with almost all of the 48 governors of the United States in the East Room 
of the White House and asked them to support his emergency measures to lift the 
country out of the Great Depression. "He is ready to lead," the governors 
agreed, "if we are ready to follow." And they made it clear they were ready to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third Time in History 
</P>
<P>
Now, for only the third time in history, an American President is calling a 
summit conference of the governors. President Bush has summoned all 50 
governors of the United States to convene on the campus of the University of 
Virginia in Charlottesville today for a two-day conference on public education. 
</P>
<P>
But the mood will be far different this time. 
</P>
<P>
The governors do not need the President to rally them to the cause. For years, 
they have been sounding dire warnings about the shortcomings of education and 
trying desperately to do something about them. In fact, many governors, whose 
state and community budgets fund more than 90% of the cost of American 
education, look on the summit conference as a way of rallying Bush to their 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Even as staunch a supporter of the President as Republican Gov. Garrey E. 
Carruthers of New Mexico looks on this summit as far different from those of 
the Roosevelts. "Bush is a listener," Carruthers said in a recent interview. 
"He's not coming to tell the governors what to do. He's not selling. He's 
buying." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Litany of Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The summit comes at a time when the American education system is held far and 
wide in poor repute. The litany of complaints is almost a cliche: 
</P>
<P>
More than 4 million students drop out of high school every year. At least 23 
million Americans are illiterate. European and Asian students almost always 
score higher than American students on international examinations in science 
and mathematics. Average scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests used by most 
universities to select applicants have dropped 90 points in the last two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
According to a procession of recent news conferences and press releases from 
governors and Bush Administration officials, no one expects the summit to 
produce concrete solutions to these problems. Instead, the plan is to set down 
a series of national goals on education and leave the strategy for meeting them 
to later conferences and, perhaps, commissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbolism Extolled 
</P>
<P>
With so little in the way of substantive strategies expected, most governors 
and Administration officials are extolling the symbolism of the conference. 
With the University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson, and the assembled 
governors in the background, Bush, according to this view, has a chance to whip 
up enthusiasm in America for changing and improving education. 
</P>
<P>
"Just by calling the summit," said Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos, "it 
means education is immediately in the forefront of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
"We will capture the public momentum," predicted Republican Gov. Michael N. 
Castle of Delaware in comments to reporters at a Southern Governors Assn. 
conference in Wilmington. "We will capture the educators themselves to make 
them realize that change is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
"We need a single cheerleader singing the same song," noted New Mexico's 
Carruthers. "Presidents do that better than governors because they have a 
national audience." 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on public relations has worried Democratic leaders, who fear that 
the summit could accomplish little more than fulfilling Bush's campaign pledge 
in 1988 to become known as "the education President." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn., said he 
did not want the summit to end up as a glorified "photo opportunity" in which 
Bush walked across the grass of the university founded by Jefferson, "our 
greatest education President." 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, Clinton told a group of reporters recently, he and 
Republican Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina tried to persuade the 
White House to open the sessions to the press. But, Clinton said, the White 
House insisted that the President "enjoys private sessions with people. That's 
consistent with his decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a few governors will join Bush in making public remarks at the 
opening and closing sessions of the conference. But all other discussions -- 
involving the President, the governors and members of the Cabinet -- will be 
private. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Model School 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps to steal some public relations thunder of their own, Democratic leaders 
held a news conference last week at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in suburban 
Maryland -- a model school with a special science program -- to propose a 
series of national educational goals in advance of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting often from Thomas Jefferson, a founder of their party, the Democrats 
stressed, as Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine put it, that 
"the major federal education programs were all Democratic initiatives. Our 
leadership in education is historic and enduring." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic goals were hardly controversial: providing Head Start and 
similar programs for all 4-year-old children who need it by 1995; sharply 
reducing differences in basic skills between white and minority children by 
1993; cutting the number of dropouts and illiterates; improving science, 
mathematics and foreign language schooling so that U.S. students do better than 
foreign students in these subjects; providing all students, regardless of race 
and income, equal opportunity to attend universities, and alleviating the 
shortage of teachers. And there is little doubt that the summit conference will 
come up with national goals along the same line. 
</P>
<P>
But the strategy for achieving these goals could stir great controversy in the 
future. The federal Head Start program, which prepares disadvantaged children 
for school, has been praised by conservatives and liberals as vital for the 
future education of the children. But federal funding is so low that the Head 
Start programs now cover only one in five children who need them. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Assn., a major organization 
of teachers, has insisted that the summit must face the problem of federal 
funding. "Money will not cure every problem that ails education," Geiger said, 
"but it is short-sighted to believe that the cure won't require any more 
money." 
</P>
<P>
But the governors, in their preliminary talks with reporters, have skirted the 
issue of federal funding. While Republican Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, 
chairman of the National Governors' Assn., has acknowledged that some of the 
governors may bring up the matter, he has said it will not be a major issue at 
the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Many governors have made it clear that their hopes for improved education rest 
on two ideas: setting national goals and decentralizing education systems. In 
addition, there seems to be almost a contempt among the governors for what 
several call "the managers of education" -- the bureaucrats who run most 
district school systems. 
</P>
<P>
The White House appears to agree with the governors. "New approaches and new 
ideas are needed," said Roger Porter, Bush's assistant for domestic policy. "We 
hope to be able to achieve a consensus on the need of new ideas and new 
approaches, and for a lot of the structural reforms that are going on 
sporadically around the country, but have not yet penetrated the overwhelming 
bulk of school districts and areas in the United States."

THE PRESIDENT'S EDUCATION SUMMIT 
</P>
<P>
Summit: President Bush has summoned the governors of all the states and 
territories to meet with him, members of the cabinet, and other Administration 
officials "on the state of American education." 
</P>
<P>
Site: The campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. 
</P>
<P>
When: Today and Thursday, Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
History: There have been summit conferences of a President and the governors 
only twice before: President Theodore Roosevelt met with the governors at a 
conference on conservation in 1908 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with 
the governors at a conference on the Great Depression in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
Politics: During the 1988 election campaign, Bush, pledging to be "the 
education President," promised to call a conference of the governors "to 
discuss the most urgent problems facing our schools." 
</P>
<P>
The agenda: The White House and representatives of the governors have agreed on 
six broad topics: (1) teaching: revitalizing a profession; (2) the learning 
environment; (3) governance: who is in charge?; (4) choice and restructuring; 
(5) a competitive work force and education; (6) post-secondary education: 
strengthening access and excellence. 
</P>
<P>
The issues: What is the role of the federal government in American education? 
Should federal spending increase significantly? How do you shake up the myriad 
of local bureaucracies that manage schools in the United States? Does the 
solution lie in giving parents the choice of sending their children to any 
school? How do you deal with the problems of school dropouts and basic 
illiteracy in America that have proven intractable in the past? 
</P>
<P>
The outcome: The President and the governors are expected to proclaim the broad 
goals of American education policy: reducing dropouts, wiping out illiteracy, 
improving test scores, expanding preschool programs, eliminating 
discrimination, and so on. But the strategy for achieving this will be left for 
future meetings or studies.

LUC WHO'S SMILING NOW; 
</P>
<P>
NEW COACH HAS MEANT NEW CONFIDENCE FOR ROBITAILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the spring of 1986, Luc Robitaille was the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League 
player of the year, the pride of the Hull Olympiques, the leading scorer in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
By the spring of 1987, he was the Kings' leading scorer and their first player 
ever selected as the National Hockey League's rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
By the spring of 1988, after having been voted into a starting spot for the NHL 
All-Star game and having repeated as the Kings' leading scorer, he was the 
favorite son, the star of the future. 
</P>
<P>
By the spring of 1989, he was fed up. 
</P>
<P>
Or was he discouraged? Disappointed? Disgusted? 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew I had the feeling I wasn't happy with my year," Robitaille 
said, understating the obvious for the umpteenth time. "I thought I could have 
done better." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wrong, really, with 46 goals and 52 assists, is there? Third on the 
team in scoring behind Wayne Gretzky and Bernie Nicholls is nothing to be 
ashamed of. 
</P>
<P>
And how about being elected by the fans, again, as the starting left wing for 
the Campbell Conference in the All-Star game? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he was a little embarrassed by that. He kept joking about how often 
his parents must have voted. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille went very meekly into that game. 
</P>
<P>
By February, much of his confidence had been chipped away. It apparently had a 
lot to do with Robbie Ftorek's coaching style. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the statistics indicate that Robitaille had another strong season. But as 
anyone with low numbers will gladly point out, numbers don't tell the whole 
story. Robitaille says it's true of high numbers, too. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, his scoring dropped steadily. After opening the season with a 
hat trick, he kind of trailed off toward the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Like the last three months," he says with a short, mirthless laugh. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the way his youthful spark faded. 
</P>
<P>
By season's end, he had no joie de vivre as they say in the part of Montreal 
where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
It was relatively early in the season when, in a fit of frustration after a 
game at the Montreal Forum, Robitaille crashed a cooler full of ice against a 
dressing room wall. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the season, even that fighting spirit was gone. 
</P>
<P>
In the final days, there were no signs of the boyish exuberance or the boyish 
charm. He was sullen. His spirit apparently was broken. 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek's way of acknowledging Robitaille's slump was to cut his ice time. That 
upset him and caused him to press when he was on the ice. Which made his slump 
worse. So Ftorek cut his ice time more . . . And tried him on different lines . 
. . And took him off the power play . . . Cut his ice time more . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was harder and harder," Robitaille said. "To play the game is about 80% up 
in your mind, and a lot of my confidence got away." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Ftorek had ever tried to talk him through it, offer advice or support 
or just attention, Robitaille said: "No." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why none of the players who were at odds with Ftorek have ever come right 
out and said anything against him, Robitaille shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to say against him. Nothing ever happened between us," he said. 
"Not much happened in the (locker) room. The players talked among themselves in 
the room, and we have a lot of great guys on the team. That was good." 
</P>
<P>
So the players would give Robitaille support. 
</P>
<P>
"But Robbie would stay in the coaches' room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbie didn't do anything really wrong. He just had his way of doing things. 
He believed in a system. He wasn't going to change his way of doing things. 
Which is probably why he's not coaching in the NHL." 
</P>
<P>
Not helping matters for Robitaille were all the trade rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the trade for Wayne Gretzky during the summer of 1988, when 
Robitaille was, indeed, considered a key bargaining chip, his name has come up 
every time a trade with the Kings has been mentioned. Rumors persisted all 
through last summer. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. A 23-year-old all-star who seems unhappy? Perfect trade bait. A 
proven young talent with, maybe, more potential who, maybe, is out of favor 
with his team? 
</P>
<P>
But Robitaille was never out of favor with the team, especially not with the 
man who really counts in trade decisions. Owner Bruce McNall is Robitaille's 
No. 1 fan. McNall went to great lengths to keep Robitaille out of the Gretzky 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
So that's what Robitaille had to keep telling himself every time he heard a 
rumor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been traded in my whole career," he said. "I wouldn't like to be 
traded now. There is no better city to play hockey in than L.A. right now. We 
want to win the Stanley Cup. The fans have been great. It's a good place to be. 
I think I have to go out on the ice and show I don't want to be traded." 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille lay low through most of the summer, taking a lot of time off as he 
regathered his confidence. He has been working with weights to improve his 
strength and his skating, and he says he feels really good. He did a lot of 
training in August. 
</P>
<P>
He obviously enjoyed training camp at Hull, where he's a fan favorite and where 
he spent hours signing autographs. He's also a media favorite, a real darling 
of the French-speaking radio and TV reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But there were just as many reporters waiting for him to switch from his more 
familiar French to his charmingly accented English. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to pack this place," he said after practice one morning, glowing as he 
recalled the days when he loved the game. "We won everything here. (Montreal 
Coach) Pat Burns was the coach, and we had a very good team. It was a good 
time." 
</P>
<P>
It was good to be back on the ice that made for those good times. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille's spirits are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
He joked about trying to grow up on a team that just keeps getting older, 
saying: "They are bringing in players old enough to be my dad. Every year I 
feel like a rookie. They might initiate me every year if it keeps going that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
But at least he has a lot of faith in all those veterans around him. "We have a 
lot of players who know how to play the game," Robitaille said. "Now just let 
them play." 
</P>
<P>
In the exhibition season, Robitaille is playing on the left side of Bernie 
Nicholls' line, with Dave Taylor on the right. They are the three Kings who 
have been Kings awhile, who have played on a line together in the past. 
</P>
<P>
He likes that, too. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, things are definitely looking up for Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
"I've improved my game a lot," he said. "I know I could have helped the team 
more last year, and I'm looking forward to having a better year. I think I'm 
better defensively -- Robbie helped me a lot with my defensive game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can help the team a lot more than I did last year. There's an 
excitement on the team now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have a fresh start with a new coach (Tom Webster). He came in and 
talked with us -- he talked with me. He told me he has confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
A bit of the old Luc came shining through with his smile as he added: "I think 
it's going to be fun."

DODGERS AGAIN SLAM DOOR ON GIANT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This clinching has become a clenching, of the San Francisco Giants' teeth, 
fists and bats. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive night against the second-worst team in their 
division, the Giants again failed to leave the field as the National League 
West champions Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stumbling over Dodger rookie starter Ramon Martinez, Dodger veteran reliever 
Jay Howell and old-fashioned Dodger hustle, they lost to Los Angeles, 2-1, 
while the San Diego Padres were defeating the Cincinnati Reds, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a four-game lead over the Padres with four games remaining, the Giants 
still need one victory or a Padre loss to clinch their second title in four 
years. In tonight's series finale, they could become the first visiting team to 
clinch a regular-season title in Dodger Stadium's 28-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Giant fans: They have not been swept in a series this season. 
The bad news: They had better not get swept tonight, because they finish their 
season with three games in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to have to go in there and win it," Giant outfielder Pat 
Sheridan said. "I've been in this situation before, and for a second-place team 
to get the leader on their field . . . it's like they see the light at the end 
of the tunnel. And when they see that, anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
More good news for the Giants is, tonight they will bring out ace starter Scott 
Garrelts and his 14-4 record. On the other hand, the Dodgers will start their 
hottest pitcher, Tim Belcher, with his six-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
And the Giants, if Tuesday is any indication, won't be the only ones showing 
the fire of a pennant contender. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind on a first-inning home run by Will Clark, the Dodgers tied 
the score on a run-scoring infield single by Martinez in the fifth and then 
went ahead for good on Eddie Murray's run-scoring double-play grounder in the 
sixth. The grounder followed a perfect hit-and-run single to left field by 
Lenny Harris that sent Willie Randolph from first to third base. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we don't want anybody partying on us," Randolph said. "If they want 
to win the thing, fine. But do it in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Before 27,622 fans Tuesday, the Dodgers finished in perfect spoiler style. For 
a second consecutive night, the Giants, who had come back to beat the Dodgers 
in three consecutive games last week, saw a late-inning comeback attempt end 
before anyone had crossed home plate. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the ninth, after Martinez had walked Kevin Mitchell and Ernest 
Riles to put runners on first and second, Jay Howell was summoned to face Matt 
Williams. Their duel lasted two seconds, as Williams grounded a hanging 
curveball to shortstop Alfredo Griffin to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "I should have hit it better." 
</P>
<P>
Said Howell: "It's not the first time I've gotten away with that. I was just 
glad to see that everything Ramon did tonight did not go up in one pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez closed out his season with his third victory in the last four starts, 
finishing 6-4 while lowering his earned-run average to 3.19. If nothing else, 
he will head for vacation knowing he has left an impression. 
</P>
<P>
"All I did was try to get them to swing the bats," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
That they did. By the time the game was three batters old, the Giants had 
scored on Clark's 23rd homer of the season, his first hit since returning from 
last week's knee injury. But after Clark's blow, Martinez retired 24 of the 
next 27 Giants and escaped two jams before leaving in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
After Clark hit a one-out single in the seventh, on the next pitch Martinez 
retired Mitchell on a pop-up to third base, then struck out Riles. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the eighth, Sheridan singled to right field, and Ken Oberkfell 
got his 16th pinch-hit of the season, a single to center. But on the next 
pitch, Brett Butler flied to right to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched one of the best games of his life," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, meanwhile, had been stifled by Giant starter Kelly Downs on one 
hit until the fifth, when they tied the score on a couple of plays that left 
the Giants moaning. After John Shelby followed Mike Scioscia's single with a 
double-play grounder, the Dodger fun started. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Gonzalez chopped a ball in front of -- and then over -- third baseman 
Williams. The ball died in shallow left field, and Gonzalez reached second with 
a double. 
</P>
<P>
Then pitcher Martinez, with five major league hits, was allowed to bat for 
himself. His ground ball sent Williams deep behind third base, and Martinez was 
safe at first. Clark then threw home, but the throw bounced, Gonzalez dived, 
and catcher Terry Kennedy dropped the ball without making a tag. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, Randolph started the sixth with a line-drive single to 
right. Randolph and Harris executed a perfect hit-and-run, with Harris lining 
the ball to left for a single and Randolph going to third. Murray grounded the 
ball to second baseman Robby Thompson, who started a double play, Randolph 
scoring. While Murray didn't get credited with a run batted in, the Dodgers had 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted this game more than any game I've ever pitched in the major leagues," 
Downs said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tim Belcher will take his last shot at the National League strikeout title 
tonight, needing eight to pass St. Louis' Jose DeLeon, who leads with 196. But 
DeLeon will make one more start for the Cardinals Sunday while Belcher, 
although he could pitch Sunday's finale on three days' rest, will have no more 
chances. Interestingly, Belcher pitches better than normal on three days' rest 
-- he's thrown two career shutouts that way. "But I wasn't going to ask them 
for that last start, it's not my style," Belcher said. "Anytime you do 
something like that, something bad always happens. You go out there trying to 
strike out people and everything goes wrong. I'm satisfied with one more start. 
It's been a good year." Belcher has already clinched the league's shutout lead 
with seven. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton will end the season with an injury he hopes will disappear in the 
winter -- a sore right shoulder. He hurt it last week when he took a grounder 
off the collarbone, and the pain has since spread so that "it feels heavy to 
even lift my arm," Hamilton said.

It is exactly a year later, and Ben Johnson is still not old news. 
</P>
<P>
He is to track and field what Shoeless Joe Jackson is to baseball. But 
Johnson's parallel of the Black Sox Scandal rests on a higher (lower?) plane. 
His was international. Or, if you will, Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
Say it ain't so, Ben. 
</P>
<P>
Say that your sport of track and field, or any sport, will be quite the same, 
even after that fateful Sept. 27, 1988, in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Say that the men and women in the white coats with their little test tubes and 
the M.D.s behind their names will not play bigger roles in your sport, and many 
others, than the men and women who call themselves coaches or athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Say that the public that pays the money to attend the events or buys the 
products advertised during the televised sports events will, someday again, 
view winners and losers with the same freedom from cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
Say it, Ben, if you can. 
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, during the Olympics, the phone calls started just after midnight. The 
news was shocking. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Johnson, Canadian sprinter who had reached the height of his success and 
acclaim just days earlier with his unheard-of 9.79-second 100-meter dash to the 
gold medal, was going to have his number taken down. The sources were reliable. 
This was the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
The dreaded S-word floated everywhere. One of the greatest athletes in the 
world, certainly the fastest therein, had tested positive for steroids. So the 
athlete wasn't an athlete, after all, but a chemically sculptured robot. 
</P>
<P>
No, this wasn't some weightlifter from Uganda or a hammer thrower from 
Czechoslovakia with an unpronounceable name and negligible public interest. 
There are a few of those caught at each Olympics with banned drugs in their 
systems, and their transgressions are dutifully reported on Page 20 of sports 
sections around the world. 
</P>
<P>
No, this was Ben Johnson. The Ben Johnson. This was an athlete whose arrival at 
the airport before the Games caused a Springsteen-like mob scene. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in Johnson's one press conference in Seoul before the track 
competition started, the airport mob scene was the biggest controversy touched 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a little old lady that got in the way and got pushed and shoved and 
could have been seriously hurt," said Charlie Francis, Johnson's coach. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, that was all so much trivia. What was about to be seriously hurt 
was the very sport that Johnson and Francis had lived off, whose ethics they 
had paid lip service to, for so long. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, their arrogance was understandable. Why, when your shell game 
has worked for so many years, would you expect the rubes in this audience to be 
any different from all those in the past who hadn't been able to find the pea? 
</P>
<P>
The official announcement was to be made in the large press conference room of 
the main press center. In the half-hour or so before it began, reporters of all 
ages and nationalities milled about, dodging television cameras, stepping over 
yards and yards of newly positioned cables. 
</P>
<P>
There was a nervous energy in the air. What is the real story? How much will be 
revealed? Will Johnson be here, too? What will the official stance be? 
</P>
<P>
But there was something else in the air, too -- a feeling of history in the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
There was no circus atmosphere here. This was not George Steinbrenner 
announcing yet another managerial firing in time for prime play on the back 
page of the New York Post. That kind of stuff is 80% show biz and 20% sport. 
</P>
<P>
This was well beyond sport and deep into ethics, morals and long-term 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
So when the Canadian contingent finally marched in and sat down behind a long 
table, and Michele Verdier of the International Olympic Committee confirmed the 
rumor, the hush before the onslaught of questions deepened. 
</P>
<P>
It was such a strange moment, so memorable for its juxtaposition of people and 
its contrast of leading characters. Here was Verdier, a tiny French woman with 
a little known public relations background and a low profile in the IOC, 
bringing one of the biggest, strongest, most recognizable stars in the history 
of the Olympics to his knees. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug is known to be called stanozolol," Verdier said, as matter of factly 
as if she were announcing the team handball competition being moved to another 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The journalism that followed in the hours after that press conference was 
generally laudable, though frantic. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters scrambled to find appropriate people to interview: other sprinters; 
other Canadian athletes; rival sprinter Carl Lewis, who had inherited Johnson's 
gold medal; Lewis' coach at Houston, Tom Tellez. The reporters reported, the 
columnists columnized and the millions of words that flowed over phone lines 
and broadcast outlets to every corner of the world in the next eight to 10 
hours must have been staggering. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of Johnson himself took on new dimensions. Where was Ben? Would he 
meet the press? Would the Canadian officials who had faced the music and 
handled themselves so well at the press conference take things a step farther 
and persuade Johnson to face, via the press, the sports world he had just let 
down? 
</P>
<P>
USA Today, in hot chase, conned an airline official into telling them that 
there was a Ben Johnson set to fly in the first-class cabin on a flight from 
Seoul to Tokyo to New York. So a reporter was dispatched with instructions to 
get on the plane and close to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter bought a first-class ticket, got on the plane, found where Ben 
Johnson was to be sitting, and came face to face with a middle-aged white man. 
When asked, the man confirmed that his name was, indeed, Ben Johnson, saying 
that although he had never taken any steroids, he had once had hemorrhoids. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter, fairly well embarrassed by then, tried to leave the plane, but 
was turned back by the stewardess, who said, citing reasons of security, that 
he would have to stay on the plane. He was able to call his office later. From 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
So where was Ben Johnson? 
</P>
<P>
He had taken the course of least resistance. He had run. He had boarded another 
plane to New York City and was not heard from again, in any real substantive 
way, until his testimony a few months ago in the Canadian inquiry into the 
entire situation. 
</P>
<P>
It is becoming more and more prevalent in sports these days, that our heroes 
take their bows but duck their downfalls. Somehow, the idea that people are 
responsible for their actions tends to be glossed over when it comes to 
athletic stars. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more meaningful moments in the long and complicated Dubin Inquiry 
into the Ben Johnson case occurred when sprinter Angella Issajenko took the 
stand. She told the inquiry panel that, had it not pressed the investigation, 
all the athletes using performance-enhancing drugs "would have gone to their 
graves" with the secret. 
</P>
<P>
"That is standard procedure -- when an athlete gets caught, you deny, deny, 
deny," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to know these days who is simply denying, since that's the "smart" 
thing to do, and who is telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
But the recognition of a drug problem in track and field -- and elsewhere in 
the world of sports -- remains a hot topic, because of Ben Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
A German magazine named all sorts of names a week ago in an article that, using 
questionable checkbook journalism, stirred once again the pot that Johnson got 
boiling a year ago. That resulted in an extraordinary network TV confrontation 
between Olympic champion Florence Griffth Joyner, one of the accused, and 
former sprinter Darrell Robinson, the accuser. 
</P>
<P>
It was great theater, but more significant, it kept the issue alive.Which isn't 
bad at all, assuming truth finally will prevail and all the cheaters will 
become casino pit bosses or politicians, where perhaps they'll feel more at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In his lead on Ben Johnson's epic 9.79-second 100 Sept. 24, Randy Harvey of The 
Times wrote that lots of things had been said about Johnson going into the 
race: He was injured, past his peak, he couldn't beat Lewis, etc. 
</P>
<P>
But in this race, Harvey wrote, "Johnson had the final say." 
</P>
<P>
How ironically wrong that turned out to be. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a cheater, was caught. Since then, some other cheaters have 'fessed 
up. Others may do the same. 
</P>
<P>
So Ben Johnson didn't have the final say, as it turns out. Perhaps truth and 
ethics will.

20 YEARS LATER, IT'S AMAZIN' CUBS WHO CLINCH NL EAST TITLE

<P>
The magic number for the Chicago Cubs is 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, given hardly a chance at the start of the year, overcame injuries and 
highly regarded contenders to culminate their season of surprises by clinching 
the National League East championship Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago won its second division title in six seasons, beating Montreal, 3-2, 
before a crowd of 11,615, bolstered by three tour groups from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The victory came soon after the second-place St. Louis Cardinals lost. And the 
Cubs celebrated in style. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't beat this. Nothing is better than the present," said Ryne Sandberg, 
the only everyday starter left from Chicago's last division championship in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs became the first team to be guaranteed a spot in the playoffs. It was 
an amazing turnaround for a club that was 77-85 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had a lot of holes at the beginning of the year," right fielder 
Andre Dawson said. "I knew we had a lot of things to get behind us." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs did, making Don Zimmer a champion for the first time as a manager in 
11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my 41st year in baseball, and a lot of good things and a lot of bad 
things have happened to me," Zimmer said. "But this tops everything that I've 
ever done in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago will open the playoffs next Wednesday night at Wrigley Field, with San 
Francisco the most likely opponent. The Cubs and Giants split 12 games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, although police had vowed to keep crowds from forming, about 2,000 
screaming, jubilant Cub fans jammed the intersection of Addison and Clark 
streets outside the main entrance to Wrigley Field, shrieking: "Bring on 
'Frisco, bring on 'Frisco!" 
</P>
<P>
And in neighborhood saloons and fashionable watering holes throughout the city, 
crowds also huddled around TV sets and raised their glasses in cheer, a bit 
surprised that the Cubs, who so frequently had flubbed chances to win pennants, 
had not blown the division race. 
</P>
<P>
Deafening cheers went up and beer flew at the Cubby Bear Lounge across the 
street from Wrigley Field with the final out in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they could do it, they're going all the way now, you can forget about 
'69," said Kathleen Danahy of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, the Cubs blew the 9 1/2-game lead they had in mid-August. The New York 
Mets won the division title and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Fans from several other bars near Wrigley Field spilled into the streets 
minutes after the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great! I used to go to all the Cubs' games when they never won. They 
never won," said Jerry Schaefer of Chicago. "You could sit anywhere. Now you 
can't get a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
City officials wanted to head off a boisterous celebration such as the one in 
1984, which drew complaints from local residents and businessman about 
late-night revelers and property damage. 
</P>
<P>
A city-sponsored "Clinch Rally" was planned for Daley Plaza on the day after 
the Cubs clinched the title, but fans were not waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major, major thing. It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," Franci Nenko 
said. "We're going to go all the way. This is like something you dream about." 
</P>
<P>
After Mike Fitzgerald made the final out of the game, the Cubs darted out of 
the dugout and met in celebration at the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg scored the go-ahead run in the eighth inning. He singled with two out 
and was running when Dwight Smith followed with a single to right field. When 
Hubie Brooks bobbled the ball for a split second, Sandberg kept going and beat 
second baseman Tom Foley's relay to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer was among the first to greet Sandberg as the Cubs spilled onto the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Maddux (19-12) allowed seven hits in 8 1/3 innings, and Mitch Williams got 
two outs for his 36th save. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this season that Maddux and Sandberg had teamed up to 
help win a big game. On Aug. 7, the Cubs took sole possession of first place 
for good when they beat co-leader Montreal behind Sandberg's home run and 
Maddux's seven-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think every time we were about to fold, we came back to win," Maddux said. 
"We're a young team and the guys are hungry. They want the things the older 
guys have." 
</P>

WASHINGTON STATE WINNING DESPITE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It probably wouldn't be accurate to say that Washington State's football team 
thrives on adversity. Nonetheless, the Cougars are winning despite injuries and 
off-the-field problems that have plagued them in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a rookie head coach, I don't think I could have handled some of the 
problems we've had with the maturity I did," Washington State Coach Mike Price 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Price, whose Cougars will play USC Saturday at Pullman, Wash., would not 
discuss the problems that produced embarrassing summer headlines for the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailback Steve Broussard spent five days in jail, charged with assaulting a 
store's night manager in Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The backup tailback, Rich Swinton, was convicted of fourth-degree assault 
for "improperly touching a woman" and was jailed for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wide receiver Tim Stallworth served 90 days in jail for traffic violations, 
including a second offense of driving with a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Linebacker Dan Grayson was jailed last spring on assault charges but was 
allowed to participate in spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
In a small town such as Pullman, players live in a fishbowl and their 
transgressions don't go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if these offending athletes had been marginal players, the cases 
probably wouldn't have attracted so much attention. 
</P>
<P>
But Broussard, who played at L.A.'s Manual Arts High School, was the Pacific 
10's leading rusher last year with 1,280 yards. He has been hampered recently 
by a hamstring injury and might not play extensively against USC. 
</P>
<P>
Although he started only two games last season, Swinton, who attended Montclair 
Prep in Van Nuys, rushed for 1,018 yards as the Cougars went 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a hamstring injury and isn't expected to play against USC. 
</P>
<P>
Stallworth, also from Montclair Prep, is not injured, however and is Washington 
State's leading receiver with 20 catches for a 19.4-yard average and four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson is a starting linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of the summer aside, WSU is playing without quarterback Brad 
Gossen, who suffered torn cartilage in his left thumb, his passing hand, two 
weeks ago against Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Gossen was a teammate of USC wide receiver Gary Wellman at Westlake High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
And 6-foot-4, 288-pound tackle Tony Savage, who has been mentioned as a 
candidate for the Outland Trophy, is recovering from an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Cougars prosper. They are unbeaten in four games and are riding a 
nine-game winning streak, its best since it went to the Rose Bowl in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had all kinds of adversity," said Price, the former Weber State coach 
who replaced Dennis Erickson, now at the University of Miami. "But we have a 
tough team and nothing is going to stop the players from reaching their goals." 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith, whose team is 2-1 after a 42-3 victory over Ohio State 
Saturday, has reason to be concerned about USC's first road game. 
</P>
<P>
Even though USC has a commanding 40-5-4 advantage in the series, it has only a 
3-2 edge -- there have been two ties -- in games played in Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington State is on a roll and, as their coach said, they've gone through a 
lot of adversity which has made then mentally tough," Smith said. "They're 
playing with a lot of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"They have great speed at the skill positions. And they have a stretch-type 
offense with the passing game and a ton of formations and sometimes no backs at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"On defense, all four of their guys in the down positions are seniors. They 
play the run really well and are excellent pass rushers. Overall, they've got 
14 interceptions to lead the country." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Cougars have had plenty of opportunities for interceptions, having 
played Brigham Young and Oregon State, both passing teams, along with Idaho and 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Price acknowledged as much, saying, "Our first season, the passing season, is 
over. Now we play the running and passing teams." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Larry Smith said that the cast will be removed from the injured thumb of 
tailback Scott Lockwood, but Lockwood is not expected to play against 
Washington State. . . . Redshirt freshman Aaron Garcia has replaced Brad Gossen 
at quarterback for Washington State. Since taking over in the third game, when 
Gossen was injured, Garcia has completed 53.7% of his passes for 322 yards, 
four touchdowns and three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback Todd Marinovich has a sprained left wrist, an injury he 
suffered against Ohio State. "I'm most concerned that the injury is on his 
throwing arm, and you can't throw a pass with a stiff wrist," Smith said. . . . 
Saturday's game will be televised by Channel 7, starting at 12:30 p.m. The game 
was originally scheduled for 2 p.m.

JUDGE BLOCKS CUTBACKS AT LOPEZ CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
OPPONENTS VOW TO FIGHT FURTHER LANDFILL DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday barred state officials from scaling 
back trash dumping at the city's Lopez Canyon Landfill, prompting the state to 
vow to appeal and neighborhood opponents to promise to escalate their battle. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Dzintra I. Janavs ruled that the 1978 permit state officials used to try 
to restrict dumping in the landfill -- destination for two-thirds of the city 
of Los Angeles' residential waste -- is out of date and vague. 
</P>
<P>
City officials maintained that had the judge enforced the 1978 limits, the city 
would have to close the landfill within days, at least temporarily, 
exacerbating Los Angeles' mounting trash disposal problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good news for the people of Los Angeles," said Deputy City Atty. 
Christopher M. Westhoff, who filed a lawsuit for the city against the state. 
"Now they know they have a place to put their trash." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency Attorneys Concede Loss 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the California Waste Management Board, the state agency that 
issued an order in July reducing trash dumping in accordance with the 1978 
permit, conceded Tuesday that they had lost this court fight. 
</P>
<P>
However, they said they would appeal and called Janavs' ruling "dead wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"She just sent a message to the whole state of California that landfill 
operators can operate any way they want," said attorney Robert F. Conheim. "If 
they happen to get away with it . . . and if enough time passes, then they're 
home free." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling caps months of wrangling between the city and state over 
whether the landfill should continue accepting trash at current levels, which 
have alarmed neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Activists who live near the northeast San Fernando Valley landfill threatened 
to resume displays of civil disobedience, including protesters massing at the 
dump's gate, blocking trucks from entering. 
</P>
<P>
They also said they hope to file a lawsuit against the city that would cite 
continuing complaints about odors, noise and litter emanating from the dump. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Smell It Every Night' 
</P>
<P>
"We live with it every single day. We smell it every night. We cannot forget 
about it," said Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Tuesday's victory, Westhoff said the city plans to apply for 
state permission to allow even more trash to be dumped at Lopez Canyon, 
although he said he does not know how large an increase will be requested. Any 
such increase ultimately must be approved by the state waste board. Lawyers for 
both sides said they are unsure if that would lead to a renewal of the battle. 
</P>
<P>
In reaching her decision, Janavs said she had to put aside issues of possible 
air and noise pollution at the dump. Instead, she said she reviewed the 1978 
permit, which she said "is vague, is ambiguous and is somewhat inconsistent," 
primarily because it talks about estimates instead of setting precise limits. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 permit set the dump's top elevation at about 1,725 feet -- instead of 
the 1,770-foot level recently reached -- limited truck traffic to about 400 
trucks per day and restricted dumping to 140 acres of the 392-acre site. The 
city said imposing the height restrictions would have caused the landfill to 
close within days until another canyon area could be prepared to accept the 
4,000 tons of trash dumped there daily. 
</P>
<P>
Janavs agreed with the city's contention that a more liberal 1983 engineering 
report prepared by the city should either have been considered an update of the 
earlier permit or should have triggered a review by the state six years ago, 
when it was submitted. 
</P>
<P>
The engineering report was requested by the state after torrential rains caused 
a hill of trash to slide onto streets and into back yards in nearby Kagel 
Canyon in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. David A. Eissler, who represented the state in court Tuesday, 
said the state never intended that report to substitute for a formal review of 
the permit's conditions. He said the waste board did not realize until several 
years later that Los Angeles was overdue for its five-year permit review, which 
should have taken place in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But Janavs said that even when faced with revised numbers included in the 1983 
report -- a 1,740-foot elevation and 500 trucks per day -- the state "didn't 
come in and say, 'Hey, you're violating the 1978 permit, you cannot do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
For the present, Westhoff said, the city will operate under a combination of 
limits set in the 1983 engineering report and those outlined in an order issued 
this summer by the county, which acts as the state's local policing body for 
the landfill. He said the city had reduced daily truck traffic from 500 to 400 
trips, but would continue to dump 45 feet or more above the 1,725-foot 
elevation the state was trying to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
The waste board began reviewing operations at Lopez Canyon earlier this year 
and stepped up its investigation after two landfill workers were overcome there 
in March by toxic gas generated by decaying waste. Simultaneously, the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District began looking into odor complaints raised 
by neighbors, resulting in an order to the city to speed up completion of a 
system to extract and burn the landfill gas. 
</P>
<P>
City sanitation and public works officials maintain that the waste board used 
Lopez Canyon to flex its muscle after state legislators and the Little Hoover 
Commission criticized it as impotent. Waste board members have repeatedly 
denied politics played a role in their actions.

SOME MONEY RESTORED, BUT 2 MENTAL CLINICS WILL CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday restored funding to some mental 
health facilities but refused to provide enough to prevent the closing Friday 
of two clinics and cuts in service at seven others. 
</P>
<P>
The West Valley Mental Health Center in Canoga Park and the Hubert H. Humphrey 
Mental Health Center in South-Central Los Angeles will be closed, bringing to 
five the number of clinics shut down this year because of a funding shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Before a jammed audience of mental health patients and workers, the board 
allocated $4.7 million in local funds to preserve a number of mental health 
programs. But supervisors refused to dig deeper into an $11-million property 
tax windfall to provide the remaining $3 million needed to stave off the 
closing of two county clinics at 5 p.m. Friday and reductions in service at 
seven other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Ed Edelman explained later that he did not seek full funding 
because he "did not have the votes and the county has pressing needs in other 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
One of the competing demands for money was evident Tuesday, as 807 social 
workers -- 63% of those who care for abused and neglected children -- stayed 
off the job to protest slow contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The social workers are among 40,000 county workers -- half of the county's work 
force -- whose contracts expire at midnight Saturday. The social workers have 
threatened to strike next Tuesday if the county does not limit their workload 
and pay a 14.5% raise over one year. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Children's Services was preparing a plan to assign 
supervisory personnel to respond to emergencies, such as police reports of 
abused or neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
During their discussion of mental health, supervisors complained about spending 
local money to bail out what they contend is a state responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Clinics where services will be reduced are Arcadia, San Antonio in Bell 
Gardens, Hollywood, Rio Hondo in Cerritos, San Pedro, South Bay in Hawthorne 
and West Central Family in the Crenshaw District.

DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AT SCHOOL PLAYGROUND WOUNDS BOY, 15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old boy was shot by youths in a car who fired toward a junior high 
school playground in South-Central Los Angeles while dozens of students milled 
around nearby on their morning break, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, wounded in the lower left arm, was in good condition at Martin Luther 
King Jr./Drew Medical Center, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of students were in the playground at Mary McLeod Bethune Junior High 
School at the time of the shooting, but there were no other injuries, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Gil Herrera said the attack appeared to be gang-related, but he was 
uncertain of the motive. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera said he was also unsure whether the victim was the target of the attack 
or an innocent bystander. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 10 a.m., when three or four youths in a car drove 
past the school on 67th Street near Broadway and began yelling obscenities, 
Principal Louvonia S. Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall did not know what was yelled, or what sparked the outburst that, she said, 
included two or three shots. 
</P>
<P>
All of the school's 1,716 students were outside at the time, although only some 
of them were in the large playground area, which includes a baseball field and 
several basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the shooting was the first at the school in her three years as 
principal.

POLICE FIND WEAPONS, CHAINS IN CAMPER; 
</P>
<P>
SECOND WOMAN ALLEGES SHE WAS ALSO HELD CAPTIVE IN TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles police detectives searching a camper in which a woman says she was 
enslaved for 14 months found weapons, chains and handcuffs Tuesday, while a 
second woman told authorities that she too was held captive, raped and beaten 
in the same vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The camper was impounded after police on Monday evening arrested a man and two 
women who were living inside. All three were booked on suspicion of kidnaping. 
The man, identified as Robert A. Gonzalez, 38, faces arraignment today on rape 
and other charges, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Six children, ages 1 1/2 to 9 years, who were living with Gonzalez and the 
women, were also taken into custody and put into foster homes, said Lt. Rick 
Morton of the Police Department's Newton Division. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities located the white Ford camper in an Azusa neighborhood after a tip 
from a woman who realized that it matched a description she saw on television 
news. The woman and her husband, Margaret and Benjamin Corona, had allowed 
Gonzalez to park the camper behind their house because they felt sorry for him 
and the children. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the camper Tuesday morning yielded loaded weapons, including one 
sawed-off shotgun and several handguns, chains, a lock and electrical wires, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, neighbors discovered something the detectives apparently missed: a baby 
carriage stuffed with 16 boxes of ammunition, three pairs of handcuffs and two 
walkie-talkies, all of which were later turned over to police. Also among the 
belongings recovered were blank birth and baptismal certificates, a church seal 
and a ski mask with eyeholes cut into it. 
</P>
<P>
Police last week put out a West Coast alert for the vehicle after a 27-year-old 
Guatemalan immigrant reported that she had been held captive inside the camper 
for 14 months and was frequently raped, beaten, tortured with electrical shocks 
and forced to cook and clean. Chained up nightly, she escaped Sept. 2 when her 
captors fell asleep, leaving a key within her reach. 
</P>
<P>
After composite sketches of Gonzalez circulated, a second woman contacted 
police this week and described a similar ordeal, Detective Michael Lewis said. 
The woman, a 24-year-old Salvadoran immigrant, said she had been held by 
Gonzalez for nearly three months last year and was also beaten and raped before 
escaping. 
</P>
<P>
She said she never reported the incident because she feared deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Police have declined to release the name of either woman. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims told detectives that they were lured to the camper with the 
promise of a job. Once there, they were overpowered and made virtual slaves. 
</P>
<P>
The children who were in the camper apparently had been fathered by Gonzalez 
but it was unclear if either of the women arrested with him was the mother, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said these were his two women, and the kids belonged to all of them. That 
was kind of his philosophy," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Women Arrested 
</P>
<P>
The two arrested women were identified as Yolanda Garcia, 28, and Margarita 
Ruvalcaba, 30. They were being held without bail in the Sybil Brand Institute, 
while Gonzalez was at the Parker Center jail. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who police said had an arrest record and used several aliases, 
managed to win the sympathies of strangers who were eager to help someone they 
believed to be struggling to provide for his large family. Many of those who 
had made his acquaintance expressed shock when told of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Lopez, 54, the owner of Transmission Pete's in Azusa, gave Gonzalez 
part-time work after he appeared at his shop on the morning of Sept. 8 with two 
of his little girls in tow. 
</P>
<P>
The English-speaking man introduced himself as Paul Garcia and asked for any 
job, saying he needed to buy food for his family and find a place to park his 
camper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seemed So Humble' 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so sorry for him," Lopez said. "There he was with his two children, 
telling me that he lived in a camper. He seemed so humble and easygoing." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez gave Gonzalez odd jobs, paying him about $130 over two weeks. When 
Gonzalez asked for help in finding a place to park his camper, Lopez 
recommended him to his nearby friends, Margaret and Benjamin Corona. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 16, Gonzalez, again with his two girls, approached the Corona house. 
</P>
<P>
"He was walking down the street and just came up and knocked on my door and 
asked if he could park at my house for a while," said Benjamin Corona, 35. 
"When I saw his children and thought of his situation I could not turn them 
away. I gave the children a soda and told him bring the truck and park in the 
driveway." 
</P>
<P>
But Gonzalez asked to park in the back yard instead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never Bothered Us" 
</P>
<P>
For more than a week the family drew water from a garden hose and cooked on a 
hot plate fueled by a tank of propane. Only once did one of the women speak to 
Margaret Corona, when she asked permission to use the house phone to call 
Gonzalez at work because she needed medicine for her sick infant. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept to themselves; they never bothered us," Benjamin Corona said. "He 
offered to give me $20, but I told him no, buy food for your family with the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
It was last Friday, while watching television news, that Margaret Corona saw a 
composite drawing of Gonzalez and recognized the camper description. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't know what to do. I felt bad calling the police on this poor family. 
What if it wasn't them?" Margaret Corona asked. 
</P>
<P>
Local police took her information and referred her to Los Angeles detectives.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSIENT STABS LIFEGUARD, FLEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A barefoot, unshaven assailant who demanded money attacked a veteran county 
lifeguard at Santa Monica Beach with a corkscrew on Tuesday, inflicting a 
four-inch cut before fleeing across the beach and up the stairs into Palisades 
Park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hearst, 34, was treated at a hospital for a slashed abdomen and released. 
The 15-year lifeguard also strained his back when he tumbled seven feet to the 
sand from a watchtower when the attacker lunged at him. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in three weeks that transients have accosted lifeguards 
on the beach, officials said. The guards in two previous incidents were not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Hearst was confronted about 8:30 a.m. when he opened his guard station about 
three-quarters of a mile north of Santa Monica Pier. The long-haired assailant, 
described as between 25 and 30, twice asked Hearst for money and then lunged 
when the lifeguard asked him to leave the tower. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful situation," said lifeguard Lt. Dick Heineman, with more than 
a hint of sarcasm. "We're trying to protect them and they're stealing from us." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica police and lifeguards said transients have grown more militant as 
their numbers have steadily increased on beaches in the past two years.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS LOBBY FOR UC CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday asked University of 
California officials to consider building campuses in Diamond Bar and the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Diamond Bar would seem to be a logical area for this new Southern California 
campus, inasmuch as it is physically located at the mid-point between the three 
existing UC campuses in the Los Angeles Basin," said Supervisor Pete Schabarum, 
whose district includes Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich persuaded the board to expand its request to include 
the fast-growing Antelope Valley, which is part of his district. 
</P>
<P>
No specific sites have been proposed in either area. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Board of Regents earlier this year began planning for three additional 
campuses and indicated that it would probably build one in Northern California, 
one in the Central Valley and one in Southern California.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIKER RESCUED AFTER 15 HOURS ON LEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 29-year-old Arcadia hiker who stumbled over a precipice and onto a ledge in 
the Eaton Canyon area of Angeles National Forest was discovered Tuesday morning 
after spending more than 15 hours on the ledge in nothing but a T-shirt and 
shorts, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Brice Boyd was rescued by the Altadena Search and Rescue Team about 9:30 a.m. 
after a woman hiker spotted him perched on the ledge, where he landed after 
stumbling over the edge of a precipice about 6 p.m. Monday, sheriff's deputies 
said. The woman ran about a mile to a phone to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopter flew Boyd to Verdugo Hills 
Hospital, where he was in stable condition with a fractured rib and internal 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the warm weather enabled Boyd to survive the night on the ledge 
in light clothing.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAS LEAK SENDS 21 AT SCHOOL TO HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Natural gas escaping from a ruptured pipeline in Pacoima drifted onto the 
campus of a nearby junior high school early Tuesday, temporarily halting 
classes and sending 20 students and a teacher's aide to hospitals with 
complaints of eye irritation and nausea, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers at Charles Maclay Junior High School noticed a "very 
strong" gas smell shortly before 9 a.m., Principal Leonard George said. School 
officials called the Los Angeles city Fire Department and directed students to 
leave their classrooms and gather on athletic fields, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 students who complained of nausea and other ailments were taken to three 
nearby hospitals for observation and later released. 
</P>
<P>
A teacher's aide who is six months pregnant was transferred to the AMI Tarzana 
Regional Medical Center for 24-hour observation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A contractor's crew working about a mile and a half south of the school 
accidentally cut a section of pipe in the 10200 block of Glenoaks Boulevard 
shortly before 8 a.m., a Southern California Gas Co. spokeswoman said. Gas 
escaped for about one hour, causing a temporary evacuation of about a dozen 
businesses along Glenoaks, she said.

BUS DRIVERS FACE DAILY HAZARDS ON SCHOOL RUNS

School bus driver Fernando Becerril, who has logged thousands of miles for the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, was on edge Tuesday. The rear-ending of a 
district bus by an allegedly drunk truck driver on the Ventura Freeway earlier 
in the morning had reminded him and other school bus operators just how 
dangerous their jobs could be. 
</P>
<P>
"That 101 (freeway), it's a nightmare," he said during a break Tuesday at the 
district's West San Fernando Valley bus yard. "It's one of the most overcrowded 
freeways in the system." 
</P>
<P>
The trucks that follow too closely are one of his biggest worries. "They make 
you nervous. When I see a caravan coming, I slow down and let them go (by)," 
said Becerril, who has driven district buses for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precious Cargo 
</P>
<P>
Leona Mason, who has been driving bus routes for the district for 16 years, 
said drivers "really have to be on the ball. People are constantly cutting us 
off. They don't realize what precious cargo we have." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's accident occurred when a car cut in front of the bus, which was 
headed toward a Woodland Hills elementary school. Bus driver Derrick Ford 
braked to avoid hitting the car, but a meat truck behind him failed to stop in 
time and slammed into the rear of the bus. Inside were 47 children. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say the accident, which caused minor injuries to the driver, 
a teacher's aide and 27 students, was an unusual occurrence. Considering the 
number of school bus trips made daily, officials said, the district's safety 
record is very good, particularly in comparison to that of private bus 
companies, which provide about 50% of the district's bus service. 
</P>
<P>
Every school day, there are 1,500 district buses on the road during peak 
traffic hours, transporting 80,000 pupils who, for a variety of reasons, rely 
on the district to transport them to schools far from their own neighborhoods. 
Altogether, district and private buses make about 5,000 trips a day, carrying 
students to and from school and on field trips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcrowded Schools 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 students are bused because their home schools are overcrowded. 
Most of them travel long distances, from areas near downtown and in the 
district's southeast region to schools in the San Fernando Valley and on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
According to district figures, district-owned buses were involved in 33 
accidents in which pupils were injured in 1987-88, compared to 63 for the 
private buses. Most of the injuries were minor cuts and bruises, transportation 
director Bud Dunevant said. A total of 511 bus accidents occurred that year, 
206 involving district buses and 305 involving private operators. Damage in 
most was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
In 50 years of transporting students, no student has died as a result of a 
school bus accident, according to Dunevant. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, eight students have died in school bus accidents over the last 20 
years, according to Ron Kinney, a school transportation official in the 
California State Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Most district bus drivers interviewed Tuesday said they doubted that anything 
could have been done to prevent the Ventura Freeway accident or the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Several drivers said they did not think seat belts, which are not required in 
California school buses, would have prevented injuries. Becerril said the extra 
padding and higher seats now required in school buses do more to prevent 
injuries than seat belts would. 
</P>
<P>
But Ford, the driver of the bus involved in the accident, was not so sure. 
Asked if seat belts might have prevented some of the injuries, he said, "That's 
a good question." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study on Seat Belts 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies by the California Highway Patrol and the National Academy of 
Sciences found insufficient evidence to conclude that belts would enhance bus 
safety, the Department of Education's Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
Some drivers said they fear that some students would use seat belts as weapons 
against other students or the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Bus driver Mason said she thought belts might help prevent some injuries, "but 
you cannot make children wear them. They can undo them. You would never get to 
school if you kept stopping to tell them to put the belts on."

REINER ON GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More double-talk and equivocation by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner (Metro, Sept. 20). 
</P>
<P>
He starts out talking firm and strong, " . . . Prosecutors will stop routinely 
plea-bargaining with gang members." But the article ends with a wimp, " . . . 
R. Dan Murphy, Reiner's director of special operations, conceded that there 
still will be cases where there is no option but to plea-bargain." 
</P>
<P>
Typical Reiner nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it is misleading for him to use the term "plea-bargain." A limit 
or "lid" on the length of the county jail or state prison sentence is the 
practical result of all these negotiated sentences. Thus, a more accurate term 
would be "sentence-bargaining."

ARTS AND THE HILL: A LOCAL LEGISLATOR LEADS CHARGE OF THE 'RIGHT BRIGADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in the bowels of that part of Hollywood where unproduced treatments 
and scripts are consigned lurks a World War II melodrama called "The French 
Doctoress." 
</P>
<P>
Thrice optioned and thrice spurned by producers, it is a would-be R-rated tale 
of spies, Nazis and the French Resistance whose heroine, in one bedroom scene, 
somehow finds time for steamy lovemaking with a shot-down pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite long odds, its ever-hopeful author talks about a pending deal in which 
"The French Doctoress" is under consideration for major studio production. 
</P>
<P>
"They could make it (the love scene) as graphic as they cared to," the aspiring 
screenwriter says. "It wouldn't bother me one bit if they made it into an R." 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of such scripts in Hollywood. This one is noteworthy not for 
its subject matter, but because the writer is a freshman congressman -- with a 
district straddling Los Angeles and Orange counties -- who has enthusiastically 
taken on the role in the House of Representatives of chief conservative 
antagonist of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The antagonism focuses on the propriety of federal financing of the arts in 
general, and on taste, decency and sexual explicitness of subject matter in 
particular. And it has become a day in the sun for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita), the man who sits and talks about his ill-fated movie deal on a 
sunny weekend afternoon in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
There is, he says, nothing inconsistent in the tastefulness of his own 
aspirations as a screenwriter and the moralistic tone of his position on the 
arts endowment in Congress. It's strictly a question, he says, of the conflict 
between private- and public-sector values. 
</P>
<P>
The klieg lights are to be turned back on today in the Washington controversy, 
which has been developing since April. Were it a movie, it could be said to 
have undergone unremitting script revision. Today's scene is the scheduled 
opening meeting of a House-Senate conference committee that is to debate a 
compromise version of the national endowment's 1990 appropriation bill. 
</P>
<P>
And it is Rohrabacher who says he will wage parliamentary guerrilla warfare 
against the compromise bill when the legislation returns for a ratification 
vote in the House. Rohrabacher wants the bill to contain at least some 
requirements stipulating the content extremes at which federal funding for arts 
projects must be cut off. If the conference committee bill includes such 
standards -- even if they are less severe than wording Rohrabacher supports -- 
he will call off the fighting and move on to his next issue. 
</P>
<P>
If the conference committee report contains no such restrictions, Rohrabacher 
says, he will wage a floor fight intended to make his squirming colleagues 
participate in a recorded vote in which he will threaten to portray anyone 
voting against him as a pornography advocate. 
</P>
<P>
But does he think he'll win? 
</P>
<P>
"When you believe, as I do, that 95% to 98% of the American people happen to 
favor fervently what you're saying," Rohrabacher says with the conviction of a 
Chautauqua tent preacher, "that only the power structure of your opponents is 
what's preventing you from accomplishing what you want to accomplish, you're 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the wealthiest people from my district have had any negative reaction to 
what I've been doing. Working people -- and 90% of the people who represent my 
constituency -- think what I'm doing is the most wonderful thing they've ever 
heard of their congressman doing." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher took over as the most visible congressman in the arts controversy 
when Rep. Dick Armey (R-Texas) abandoned a territory he had staked out for 
himself in the issue several weeks ago. Rohrabacher has been even more visible 
lately because the chief of conservative strategy in the whole affair, Sen. 
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), has pulled back -- at least temporarily, a Helms aide 
said earlier this week -- from his own highly visible role in the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, 42, is a former speech writer for President Ronald Reagan and 
former editorial writer for the Orange County Register who said in an interview 
that he would prefer to do away with every penny of the endowment's proposed 
1990 budget of $171.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
But he says at the same time that the $193 million the Defense Department is 
spending on military bands this year -- scheduled to increase to $200.4 million 
in 1991 -- shouldn't be touched because of "how necessary they are for the 
morale of the men. And the job of defense is the job of the federal 
government." 
</P>
<P>
"At a time of high deficit spending, when we are struggling to come up with 
funds for the elderly and prenatal care," Rohrabacher says, "for (the national 
endowment) to go around and spend it on art is something we might have been 
able to afford in past years, but we can't afford today. 
</P>
<P>
"The NEA people should have their own standards for what is decent and what is 
indecent. If they are so far off the wall that they end up endorsing things 
that are no better than what you find at a porno bookstore, then you have to 
say their values on this are out of touch and they shouldn't be the ones making 
the decisions." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Palos Verdes High School, Rohrabacher attended Harbor Junior 
College and got a degree in history from Cal State Long Beach and a master's -- 
in American studies -- from USC. He worked as a reporter for a local wire 
service in Los Angeles in the early 1970s, then as an assistant press secretary 
in Ronald Reagan's unsuccessful 1976 presidential campaign and then in 1980, 
when Reagan won. 
</P>
<P>
His reward was a White House job as one of Reagan's five senior speech writers, 
during which he came to identify with key figures in the Iran-Contra scandal, 
specifically forming a friendship with former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. 
When he left the White House to run for Congress in March, 1988, Rohrabacher 
recalls, "they said, 'You'll have to shave your beard and stay away from Ollie 
North.' " Rohrabacher -- who thought he knew the 42nd California Congressional 
District better than that -- did neither. And he won. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he chuckles when he is asked if the subject of censorship is something 
he and North have discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"He (North) would probably want the money (budgeted for the NEA) delivered to 
the Contras," Rohrabacher says, laughing. "But, I swear, that is not my plan." 
</P>
<P>
He insists that, ideologically, he is his own man. He notes that he voted 
against full funding for the B-2 bomber even though all other California 
Republicans voted for it, and that he defied President Bush and opposed the 
Midget Man missile. The B-2 vote was especially wrenching, Rohrabacher said, 
because his own brother is employed on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher is single and lives in Lomita, but as a freshman congressman, he 
has learned the existence of red-eye flights between Washington and Los Angeles 
-- a life style he says he figures he can handle for about 10 years, tops. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bad," he says of living weekdays in Washington and weekends in his 
district. "I mean, this is bad." 
</P>
<P>
He says he's not much of a sports fan but favors spending his free time reading 
or writing. When he gets out of politics, he says, he hopes for a career as a 
novelist or screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody," he says, "should think I'm anti-arts. I'm a man of the arts. I like 
the arts. I like the symphony. I used to go to the Kennedy Center (in 
Washington) all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher has had a difficult transition to life in Washington and the 
Congress. For one thing, he complains, waves suitable for his favorite sport, 
body surfing -- so plentiful at his favorite haunts in Seal Beach -- are 
available nowhere within less than a four-hour drive of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
And there is another problem: "They don't even know how to make a margarita in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
In a broader sense, though, observes Rohrabacher, being a congressman is like 
being a guest at the Mad Hatter's tea party in "Alice in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
Would he care to identify the Mad Hatter? "I am working in the Mad Hatter's tea 
party, (and) the Mad Hatter wasn't the only crazy person there," Rohrabacher 
says, indicating a bipartisanship to the insanity. "That's certainly what (you 
see) when you take a look at Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"To try to predict and base (the planning of) your life on what the Mad Hatter 
is going to be doing as he runs around the tea party is impossible. How long 
would Alice have remained sane had she stayed there?" 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher says he realizes that first-term congressmen like him are, by 
definition, appropriately described as obscure. And he may be a somewhat 
contradictory personality. 
</P>
<P>
But Rohrabacher's embrace of libertarian-conservative ideology and a clear 
recognition of the need to quickly make a name for himself have cast him in the 
role as one of the leaders in a right-led arts protest like none Washington has 
ever seen. It is the most spirited -- and, arts advocates contend, threatening 
-- controversy in the national endowment's 25-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the midst of it, Rohrabacher's polite invective spares no one. Even 
Helms, he says, is part of the problem, because the North Carolina senator has 
too entrenched a reputation for waging hate campaigns against life styles with 
which he disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"What really has served to polarize this debate, unfortunately," Rohrabacher 
says, "was Sen. Helms' image and the old-line image of (other) people involved 
in this. Basically, they do not have the same libertarian notion of the First 
Amendment that I have." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, Rohrabacher says Helms is to be congratulated for 
devising the wording of an amendment to the NEA money bill that now bears 
Helms' name. It would bar federal funding for artworks alleged to be offensive, 
indecent or obscene. 
</P>
<P>
What he's really getting at, Rohrabacher concedes, is the undercurrent in the 
debate over the national endowment that clearly is a dispute over the morality 
of gay life styles. It arises because one of the photographers whose work 
brought about the current controversy was the late Robert Mapplethorpe, who 
died of AIDS this year and whose work includes some graphically sexual images 
of male nudes. 
</P>
<P>
What some critics contend is a homophobic preoccupation has underlain many of 
Helms' public statements on the controversy and been a dominant theme in 
speeches and comments by Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton). Among these 
critics is Jock Reynolds, director of the Washington Project for the Arts, 
which agreed to display a Mapplethorpe show after the Corcoran Gallery of Art 
canceled it in an ill-fated attempt at defusing the NEA controversy in June. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting Rohrabacher's attempt this month to preserve restrictions on the 
arts endowment in the pending legislation, Dannemeyer noted that the motion 
picture "Cabaret" depicted Germany in the 1920s and the "growth in toleration 
of homosexuality in Germany in the era. Let us not kid ourselves. The 
toleration of pornography and homosexuality is . . . the symptom of a moral 
decay in a society that has lost the ability to say that there are standards 
that governed mankind down through time." 
</P>
<P>
It is at this juncture between ideological objection to federal spending for 
the arts combined with distaste for the subject matter of some federally funded 
art and unadulterated gay-bashing that Rohrabacher parts company with his more 
established conservative patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher winces when he is asked, for instance, whether he parts company 
with Dannemeyer in terms of the relevance of homosexual subject matter in the 
current debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, absolutely," Rohrabacher says. "I don't want to characterize what his 
(Dannemeyer's) motives are. Any attempt, by anyone, to try to make this into an 
attack on someone's personal life style has actually detracted from the central 
issue, and I have not done that at all. And I do not ever plan as a congressman 
to use my office as a forum to attack people's personal life styles. Period."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'HARD COPY' -- BY ANY OTHER NAME IT'S STILL 'TABLOID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They're fooling around with the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alf 
</P>
<P>
Dueling tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
Now available in your home are the true stories about the rumors about the 
innuendoes about the insinuations about the gossip about the hearsay, all of it 
based on highly reliable scuttlebutt from anonymous sources. The plush star of 
NBC's "Alf" was right Monday night in his assessment of tabloids. They are 
fooling around with the universe. 
</P>
<P>
And after years of fooling around mostly in print, they're now doing it on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
You've got your "Inside Edition," "Inside Report" and the "Inside Story" 
segment of "Entertainment Tonight." You've got your "America's Most Wanted," 
"Unsolved Mysteries" and the new "Crimewatch Tonight" and "Missing/Reward." 
You've got your "A Current Affair" and "The Reporters." 
</P>
<P>
And now you've also got your "Hard Copy," a new syndicated series on KNBC 
Channel 4 that follows "Entertainment Tonight" and on Wednesdays leads into 
NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
The schlock bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's "Hard Copy" was originally titled "Tabloid," but that name was 
dropped -- apparently because it was too accurate. Judge for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, "Hard Copy" aired the first part of its "exclusive" investigation 
into the sabotaging of Pan Am Flight 103, the jet that exploded over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all aboard. Although relying on anonymous 
sources, it was a convincing story that named the alleged bombers and presented 
what it said was evidence that "Iran ordered the bombing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, a tough, honest piece of reporting. 
</P>
<P>
Like all tabloids, however, "Hard Copy" suffers from guilt by association -- 
with itself. It's difficult buying the show's Pan Am expose when only last week 
it premiered with a slimy piece on the demise of Christina Onassis, using 
creepy music and gossip to imply that something was amiss ("A curtain of 
silence dropped over the death"). 
</P>
<P>
If only a curtain of silence would sometimes drop over "Hard Copy," which was 
at its pathetic worst last week in exposing the Hollywood stars who "blow their 
tops." As evidence of the incestuousness of rumor-mongering, the source for the 
"Hard Copy" gossip was a gossip columnist for that scandal sheet, the Star. As 
evidence of malicious intent, "Hard Copy" reported that Clint Eastwood is 
adored by everyone who works with him, then went on to lump him with the 
alleged stormy stars anyway because he reportedly gets mad at people who take 
his parking spot when he's working on a film. The tyrant! 
</P>
<P>
Anchored by Terry Murphy and Alan Frio, "Hard Copy" can be nice, as it was in 
its tribute to Gilda Radner. But it's obviously more comfortable being snide, 
as it was in twitting Maury Povich, anchor of older rival "A Current Affair," 
for supposedly getting snowed on the "Biker Mom" story on which "Hard Copy" 
claimed to have gotten the real scoop. This was a payback for the equally snide 
Povich reporting on charges of "entrapment" against "Hard Copy" concerning its 
expose of minors being allowed inside Atlantic City casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Nyeh nyeh nyeh-nyeh nyeh. 
</P>
<P>
"A Current Affair" (weekdays at 7:30 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11) and "Hard Copy" 
-- which simulated a sensational murder Monday -- both engage in re-creations. 
But "Missing/Reward" -- which advertises rewards that the public can cash in on 
by supplying information -- really went over the edge in its premiere 
(Saturdays at 4:30 p.m. on Channel 4, Mondays at 10:30 p.m. on Channel 3). Its 
segment on an allegedly innocent man convicted of murder supported the man's 
story with a simulation of "one possible explanation" of what really happened. 
Is this the future -- simulations of possibilities? 
</P>
<P>
Tabloid programs are so outrageous that they're nearly impossible to parody, 
because they almost seem to parody themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than trying to outdo the real thing, however, "This Is David Lander" 
takes another route in spoofing America's tabloid TV. The results -- the series 
from England's Channel Four is running at 7:30 p.m Saturdays on cable's Bravo 
channel -- are quietly brilliant, and as stone-faced and underplayed as the 
tabloids themselves are overcooked. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is a muckraking tabloid show that, among other things, investigates 
a housing development that is falling apart. The show is careful to shield its 
sources, and in one sequence shows the real person on camera, but protects his 
identity by substituting an actor's voice. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, why not an actor lip-syncing the real person's voice? 
</P>
<P>
No level of conduct seems beyond the tabloids. If they have a common 
denominator beyond hyperbole, however, it's crime. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the consistently straightest of the tabloids -- but also the most 
paranoid -- is the new "Crimewatch Tonight" (weekdays at midnight on KCOP 
Channel 13). "Crimewatch Tonight" has an image of credibility in host Ike 
Pappas. He spent 25 years with CBS News, covering, among other things, the 
Vietnam War, Che Guevara and the Six-Day War in Israel, none of which has 
anything to do with the "daily battle with the criminals that infect our world" 
covered by "Crimewatch Tonight." But a job's a job. 
</P>
<P>
The crimes on "Crimewatch Tonight" almost seem to merge into a single 
frightening blur, with each segment distinguishable from others only by the 
level of fear it incites. A Monday segment showed police surveillance tape of 
U.S. drug dealers attacking cops. "Crimewatch Tonight" used this to warn 
viewers that Colombia's drug anarchy "could happen here," too. That was a huge 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The overreached conclusion -- unsupported by the facts -- is a favorite of 
tabloids. Hence, "Hard Copy" concluded after its story on the Beverly Hills 
murder of entertainment industry figure Jose Menendez and his wife, Rose Marie: 
"The show business community is on edge." Yes, all of it, from Malibu to 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the tabloids may be "Inside Edition" (weekdays at 8:30 p.m. on 
KHJ-TV Channel 9), whose shortcomings are outnumbered by its strengths. The 
latter include Monday's sober, well-constructed story on a former female cop 
who is in prison for a murder she claims she didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
The sewer of tabloids is surely "A Current Affair"-clone "Inside Report" 
(weekdays at 5:30 p.m. on Channel 13), which hit a low Monday in speculating on 
the possible fate awaiting Zsa Zsa Gabor in Los Angeles County Jail, depending 
on the outcome of her trial. The piece spoke directly to Gabor, interviewing 
"some of the girls you'll be bunking with." 
</P>
<P>
As disgusting as it was, however, it somehow paralleled the mocking tone of the 
coverage that the Gabor trial has been getting by some stations. The main 
culprit has been usually straight KCBS-TV Channel 2, which seems incapable of 
playing the Gabor story without snickering, even though this is a criminal 
proceeding carrying a possible prison sentence. Is the purpose of a newscast to 
cover a story just to laugh it? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this -- the further seepage of tabloid values into generally legitimate 
newscasts -- is the ultimate danger for television and for viewers who rely on 
the medium for most of their information. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently, NBC hired David Nuell, executive producer of "Entertainment 
Tonight," as senior executive producer of its venerable "Today" show, whose 
ratings have been slipping. 
</P>
<P>
Nuell may be just the right person to rebuild "Today" into the ratings 
powerhouse it once was, just as he did for the syndicated "Entertainment 
Tonight" by guiding its transition from middle-brow entertainment news to a 
gossipy tabloid show specializing in rumors about the stars. "Today" today, 
tabloid tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
The universe changes.

DIRT BAND NICE, HARDLY GRITTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If nice guys finish last, at least they get to hang around long enough to be 
last. With 23 years behind them, not too many bands have endured as long as the 
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, or with less acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
The Dirt Band has certainly generated its share of hits, but aside from the 
barrier-breaking 1972 "Will the Circle Be Unbroken" album, it has also been a 
group easily taken for granted; just nice guys making nice music in a business 
where nice is rarely a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
The quartet's early show Monday at Santa Ana's Crazy Horse Steak House and 
Saloon was proof of the continuing appeal of the band's good-timey country-rock 
and an example of its limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Founding member Jeff Hanna and guitar/bass/mandolin player Jimmy Ibbotson 
handled the front line vocals with capable ease, with occasional lead vocals 
from keyboardist Bob Carpenter, and Jimmy Fadden impressively playing drums and 
harmonica simultaneously. But the aggregate effect was such that, if one had 
found the Dirt Band playing in a hotel lounge, the response would more likely 
be, "Hey, good lounge act" than "What cruel fate has denied these fellows their 
rightful spot at the pinnacle of fame?" 
</P>
<P>
Of the show's 18 songs, Bob Dylan's "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" from the 
newly-released "Circle, Vol. II" album, the Carpenter-sung "Stand a Little 
Rain" and the round-like harmonies of "Fishing in the Dark" carried more weight 
than most of the country-lite fare. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, two decades of playing "Mr. Bojangles" nightly hasn't added anything 
to their hit version, already a sticky confection compared to the Jerry Jeff 
Walker original. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, the one real standout of the performance was Ibbotson's "Ripplin' 
Waters," a song once covered by John Denver. Sparked by a round of hot solos, 
particularly Hanna's guitar workout, the song finally found the band living up 
to its name and throwing some grit into the musical mix. JIM WASHBURN

'MUTANT ON BOUNTY' ABANDONS GOOD SENSE

<TEXT>
<P>
"Mutant on the Bounty" (at the AMC Century 14) is too amusingly schlocky a 
title to waste on such a hopelessly inane and pointless space comedy. 
</P>
<P>
While on some sort of research mission, a spaceship crew encounters a saxophone 
player whose face is a mess after floating 23 years in space -- he's the benign 
mutant of the piece. Later on, the crew is menaced by a goofy pair of space 
bandits who have in their possession a deadly virus. Only performance artist 
John Fleck, who tries hard to be funny as a campy android, is worthy of mention 
in the entire amateurish enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Because the AMC Century 14 is perversely screening a trailer of "Mutant on the 
Bounty" (Times-rated Mature for crude language) immediately preceding its 
presentation, you can't say you haven't been warned.KEVIN THOMAS

AIDS POLICY, TREATMENT EXAMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strengths and shortcomings of PBS' "The AIDS Quarterly" series are brought 
out in full relief in tonight's edition (at 9 on Channel 28, at 8 on Channels 
50 and 15, at 10 on Channel 24). 
</P>
<P>
Because of the virus' pervasive nature, triggering a new crisis with depressing 
regularity, PBS' decision this year to broadcast a quarterly, magazine-style 
show was a wise one. AIDS news breaks fast -- faster than the traditionally 
methodical pace of public-television journalism can keep up with. This 
magazine, hosted by Peter Jennings, fills a need. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's stories, though, may be too brief. The substance of the first 
entry, on the disease's effect on the African American and Latino communities, 
is made slight by a far more penetrating report, "The Other Faces of AIDS," 
that follows "The AIDS Quarterly" at 10 p.m. on Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
The "Quarterly" uses Chicago as a case study of the discriminatory manner in 
which resources and means to reverse AIDS have been distributed. While the 
Howard Brown Memorial Clinic on the city's Anglo North Side has become a model 
of state-of-the-art AIDS treatment, the African American South Side and Latino 
West Side have gone begging. A disastrous mix of entrenched racism, successful 
white gay lobbying and city mismanagement have made a bad situation only worse. 
</P>
<P>
But it takes "The Other Faces of AIDS" to explore, in cities from Los Angeles 
to Miami's Little Haiti, why it's worse. AIDS has exposed, according to 
community workers such as Rashidah Hassan and Don Edwards of the National 
Minority AIDS Council, a psychology of denial, homophobia and moralism 
widespread in many minority communities. The churches, traditionally the center 
of both stability and social change, have been both a help and hindrance in 
AIDS education and support. The media messages have been either culturally 
inappropriate or timid. 
</P>
<P>
The picture here is nearly as hopeless -- what are neighborhoods already beset 
by unemployment, homelessness and armed groups peddling drugs to do with this 
new crisis? But the picture is a full one, and overdue. 
</P>
<P>
The last piece in the "Quarterly" report is a portrait of a woman infected with 
AIDS by her bisexual husband, who fell in love with a man just before their 
marriage. The sensationalist aspects of the story are toned down to make room 
for the real theme, which is how little AIDS research has been done for women. 
The result is a shocking lack of care resources for a group facing a spread of 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings' interview with Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman, president of the American 
Foundation for AIDS Research, was unavailable for review.

A NAIVE, NERVY 'LET LOVE RULE'

<P>
LENNY KRAVITZ 
</P>
<P>
"Let Love Rule." Virgin 
</P>
<P>
Kravitz is the hottest comer in the hippie wanna-be sweepstakes. His debut 
includes titles like "Flower Child" (an ode to wife Lisa Bonet) and overflows 
with enough exhumed peace and love to maybe make even Wavy Gravy choke. There 
are delusions of grandeur plenty in Kravitz's debut, not just in the lyrics, 
but also in the such sources as Lennon (circa "Plastic Ono Band") and Prince 
(psychedelic era). 
</P>
<P>
This shocking derivativeness would be plenty irritating if -- dang -- he didn't 
first derive from such great sources and then pull it off with such naive 
nerviness. Start with the drug-themed "Blues for Sister Someone," which sounds 
like the Purple One screaming his own ravaged version of "Cold Turkey." 
</P>
<P>
There are moments here where he comes close to finding his own voice, or at 
least avoids someone else's: "Mr. Cab Driver" is a fun, angry, minimalist 
rocker about what it's like to be black and not be able to hail a taxi. Much 
here bodes that Kravitz may have a great album in him when he gets a little 
less young, puts the incense away and combines his idealism with a pragmatist 
work ethic. CHRIS WILLMAN

HURRICANE HUGO MAY BE MOST COSTLY STORM EVER; 
</P>
<P>
2 BIGGEST INSURERS IN CAROLINAS ESTIMATING LOSSES AT $600 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday 
that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane 
Hugo. Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever 
for the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South 
Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons 
said. The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 
million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 
million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages 
caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and 
Mississippi in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Our previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in 
comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston. 
There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the 
severity of damage" as in Hugo, Parsons said. Officials said property damage 
from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and 
then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population 
centers, including Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losses Still Being Tallied 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in 
North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest 
insurer in South Carolina. "We have so far received 16,000 claims," spokesman 
Bob Sohozich said. 
</P>
<P>
Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little 
doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 
million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck 
Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on 
overall insured losses from Hugo. Although the losses are substantial, they are 
not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because 
reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs. For example, 
Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while 
its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages. Reinsurers -- which 
share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the 
premium income -- typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, 
which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane 
Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for 
the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm. The 
New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands, where Hugo first struck with devastating force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forecasts May Be Cut 
</P>
<P>
The charge might push Continental into the red for the quarter, said Udayan 
Ghose, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. "If there is a 
profit, it will be a very small one," he said. The charge will cut expected 
annual earnings by close to 25%, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Ghose said Shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings 
projections for Cigna Corp., USF&amp;G Corp. and Lincoln National Corp., which 
are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected 
full-year earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, 
and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest. But "this could be a 
positive for the industry," Ghose said, explaining that the industry is in the 
middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized. Billions of dollars in 
losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have "a significant 
impact on excess capital," he said, causing insurance firms to raise prices 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be good for the companies and shareholders," he said.

Accounting Merger Talks Halted: Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse 
&amp; Co. said they have ended merger talks that would have created the world's 
biggest accounting and consulting company. The discussions were discontinued 
because differences could not be resolved within a realistic period, the 
companies said in a joint statement. Other factors, including regulatory 
concerns, also helped to derail the talks. The Justice Department asked Price 
Waterhouse for information, including client lists, shortly after the merger 
talks were announced July 6, an official said. He noted that the Department 
requested the same data from Arthur Andersen.

USAir to recover $1 million to $1.5 million in lost wages for about 300 former 
Pacific Southwest Airlines flight attendants forced to take leaves of absence

the policy was discriminatory. USAir, which acquired PSA in April, 1988, had no

IBM UNVEILS BIG PLANS FOR PC MICRO CHANNEL DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday revealed ambitious plans for its 
Micro Channel architecture, its patented design for moving data through its 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's largest computer maker also announced that it has signed separate 
agreements with Intel Corp. and Chips &amp; Technologies to develop Micro 
Channel-designed semiconductors. The deals were seen as efforts to shorten the 
time it takes to design products for IBM personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the announcements, among the most aggressive yet from IBM on 
behalf of the Micro Channel design, were intended in part to counter the 
momentum of a rival design standard that is being pushed by the "Gang of Nine" 
-- a group of competitor PC manufacturers led by Compaq Computer Corp. The 
rival standard has gained speed and, just recently, Advanced Logic Research 
Inc. said it will begin shipping the first computer built to that standard next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
IBM has tried to make Micro Channel into an industry standard, but companies 
that have used the design under license to IBM have met with limited success. 
IBM is hoping that Tuesday's announcements will persuade customers that Micro 
Channel, originally unveiled 18 months ago, is the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
In its announcements Tuesday, IBM said it intends to use Micro Channel not only 
with personal computers, but eventually with high-speed workstations and even 
mainframe computers. IBM also said that Micro Channel is theoretically capable 
of transferring data at 160 million bytes per second, eight times as fast as 
its current speed limit. A byte represents one letter or number. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to show a sense of order in a potentially chaotic environment," 
said Sam Albert, a former IBM executive who is now a consultant in Scarsdale, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's rivals say their personal computer standard is better because there are 
more add-on devices that will work with it. But IBM said there are more than 
1,000 add-on devices made by other companies.

TOYS R US TO TEAM WITH MCDONALD'S IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toys R Us Inc., the world's largest toy seller, said Tuesday that it will take 
its low-price, high-volume specialty merchandising to Japan with the help of 
Ronald McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramus, N.J., toy retailer plans to open four to six stores in Japan in 
1991 and eventually as many as 100 under an agreement with McDonald's Co. 
(Japan) Ltd. Under terms of the joint venture, McDonald's may open fast-food 
outlets at the store sites. 
</P>
<P>
The two are likely to shake up the fragmented retail toy market in Japan. Toys 
R Us will export its huge 46,000-square-foot store format, which depends on 
direct shipments from manufacturers for cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
That is likely to test the tolerance of Japan's layered distribution system and 
the might of the small Japanese retailers whose legal rights to block large, 
new stores have been modified recently. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's Japan, headed by the well-known entrepreneur Den Fujita, should help 
expedite Toys R Us' entry into Japan through site location, real estate and 
understanding of the Japanese consumer. His firm, which has a 20% interest in 
the joint venture versus an 80% share owned by Toys R Us, sells $1.2 billion in 
hamburgers in Japan though 675 outlets. McDonald's Japan is equally owned by 
Fujita &amp; Co. of Japan and McDonald's Corp. of Oak Brook, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really have is a situation, given the unique cultural and real estate 
challenges in Japan, where we thought we should get a joint venture partner. We 
spent two years exploring the market and came up with Den Fujita," Robert C. 
Nakasone, vice chairman of Toys R Us and president of its worldwide toy stores, 
said in a telephone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we feel we have the premier entrepreneur and businessman in Japan who will 
be our partner," Nakasone added. "His record speaks for itself with what he has 
done with McDonald's. With his real estate development knowledge and 
understanding of demographics, he will be helpful in developing an A-plus store 
network strategy for us." 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone, a Southern California native, said the firm has done some initial 
work on locations, but he wouldn't disclose the sites. 
</P>
<P>
One industry report has estimated the Japanese retail toy market at $3.2 
billion in 1987. Hirokazu Ishii, an analyst at the Nomura Research Institute in 
New York, said that until recently there were no toy specialty chains in Japan. 
Toys were largely sold through department or mass-merchandise stores or 
mom-and-pop outlets. He said Chiyoda, a discount shoe chain operator, recently 
launched some toy stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential is very huge," said Ishii, who follows both Toys R Us and 
McDonald's. However, he said, the dai teno rule, or big store regulation rule, 
may be an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
The rule requires retailers planning stores larger than 6,000 square feet to 
get the approval of small retailers in the area. Ishii says the rule has 
delayed store start-ups up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone sees no problem. "Our understanding is that it (the rule) has been 
liberalized in the past year with the backing of MITI (Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry).

IRAN OFFERS IDEAS TO END OPEC DEADLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
TALKS EXTENDED TO TAKE UP PROPOSAL THAT FAVORS BIG PRODUCERS 
</P>

<P>
OPEC oil ministers Tuesday extended their talks to a fifth day after Iran put 
up surprise proposals to end a deadlock on assigning production quotas among 
its members. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates of Iran told lobby reporters that higher world petroleum prices was 
one goal. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have been 
stymied for four days trying to agree on output quotas to remove excess supply 
from the world market. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's initiative led to a full session of the conference due Tuesday night to 
be put off until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, UAE Favored 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the ideas need to be cooked a little more," said Iraqi minister Issam 
Abdul-Rahim Chalabi, adding that some delegations would contact their 
governments for instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian formula seems to favor the big Gulf producers with some of the 
poorer, debt-laden Third World OPEC members likely to get smaller increases in 
their mandated quotas. It drew a mixed initial reaction, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
Those getting special treatment would include Kuwait and the United Arab 
Emirates, whose demands to sell more oil and open violations of existing quotas 
are the hot issues at the talks. 
</P>
<P>
A conference dispute flared between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis say they are tired of seeing quota busters help themselves to sales 
of oil and, in the process, put enough excess on the market to keep prices 
below an OPEC target of an average $18 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for OPEC is that it can't -- for fear of flooding the market -- set 
a ceiling on its total output high enough to fit the sales ambitions of Kuwait 
and the UAE into the quota system without others conceding percentage market 
share. 
</P>
<P>
The three biggest OPEC producers, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, are among those 
who refuse to surrender any share of overall output. 
</P>
<P>
But they would not do so under the reallocation now suggested by Iranian 
minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh, according to Iranian delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Their share would stay the same while smaller producers Algeria, Nigeria, 
Indonesia, Libya and Venezuela would make the concessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase for 3 
</P>
<P>
Three other smaller exporters, Ecuador, Gabon and Qatar, which also contend 
that their existing quotas are unjustly low, would get disproportionate 
increases like those for Kuwait and the UAE. 
</P>
<P>
The trick would be to set the ceiling on total volume high enough to ensure 
that all of the 13 members got at least some volume increase -- but low enough 
to achieve a boost in prices as a bait for those who lost on the percentage 
game. 
</P>
<P>
A Gulf delegate said he understood that Kuwait would get 1.35 million barrels 
daily -- which it says it wants -- and so would the UAE. But the UAE wants 
more. 
</P>
<P>
An Iranian delegate said Saudi Arabia may accept the idea as long as it keeps 
its historic 25% share.

MONEY IN MELONS;

LINDEMANN PRODUCE SERVICES ITS WORLDWIDE MARKET YEAR-ROUND.

LOS BANOS, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 9 in the morning as George Lindemann, president of one of the nation's 
biggest shippers of cantaloupes and honeydew melons, checks his computer 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sold 17,000 cartons so far this morning," he says. "We have 2,000 
cartons left to sell. We have already sold 15,000 cartons (for delivery) 
tomorrow, 10,000 cartons the next day and 7,000 cartons the day after that." 
</P>
<P>
Lindemann Produce Inc., headquartered in this San Joaquin Valley farming 
center, owns no farmland but -- because of arrangements with growers from 
California to Panama -- is the only melon shipper, so far as is known, that 
markets the fruit year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Lindemann sales force in Los Banos start work each day at 5 
a.m., on the phone with buyers for chain stores, brokers and wholesalers 
representing 1,500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
The company ships melons -- most under the Lindy's Delight label -- every month 
to all 50 states and to every province in Canada. It also exports honeydews to 
Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a mile from company headquarters one day recently, 150 workers were 
busy processing hundreds of tons of cantaloupes and honeydews being unloaded 
from a steady stream of trucks onto conveyor belts leading into two huge 
packing sheds. 
</P>
<P>
On nearby farms, migrant workers were hand-picking ripe melons from the vines. 
In an 18- to 20-day period, pickers typically go through a cantaloupe field 13 
times, each time judging the fruit by its color and picking only at the peak of 
ripeness. 
</P>
<P>
California and Arizona together account for 70% of the U.S. crop, producing 
about 26 million cartons of cantaloupes on 65,000 acres and 10 million to 12 
million cartons of honeydew on 20,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Of those totals, Lindemann's U.S. growers produce 2.5 million to 3 million 
cartons of cantaloupes on 8,000 acres and 1.7 million to 2.2 million cartons of 
honeydews on 3,200 acres between May and late November every year. 
</P>
<P>
The average price received by the grower is $4.50 for a 40-pound carton -- 
about 11 cents a pound, compared to the 29 to 49 cents a pound the melons cost 
at California stores this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lindemann, 46, whose family has been farming in the San Joaquin Valley for 66 
years and producing melons for 47 years, said, "We have joint venture 
partnerships with 55 growers in California and Arizona, with eight growers in 
Mexico and nine growers in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Panama. Our 
winter crop comes from Mexico and Central America," where Lindemann growers 
produce about a million cartons of both kinds of cantaloupes and honeydews 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which provides farmers with half of the cost of producing the 
melons, harvests and markets the crop. "We share the risk with the growers and 
split the profits with them," Lindemann said. 
</P>
<P>
Until five years ago, the company owned 12,000 acres in the Los Banos area -- 
land devoted to grapes, almonds, peaches, beef cattle, dairy herds and cotton. 
But then the land was sold and 85% of Lindemann's business is now made up of 
processing and marketing cantaloupes and honeydews, with the rest involving 
other melons, lettuce, apricots and asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
Because cantaloupes are so perishable, every effort is made to get them to 
market as quickly as possible. Cantaloupes picked are often for sale in 
California's supermarkets within 24 hours of being picked. To truck them to the 
East Coast, however, takes about five days, so refrigerated trucks are used -- 
with freight costs often as much as the cost of the melon. 
</P>
<P>
Honeydews have a thicker rind than cantaloupes and remain in stable condition 
much longer. They are carried by ship to East Asia, where Lindemann sells $1.5 
million to $2 million worth a year.

<P>
The stock market finished slightly higher Tuesday after a strong rally fizzled 
in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials ended with a gain of 4.75 points at 
2,663.94 after climbing more than 21 points during the session. On Monday, the 
blue chip indicator dropped 22.42 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 740 issues 
up, 634 down and 556 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 158.35 million shares, up from 121.13 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
183.925 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened broadly higher, aided by a sharp run-up in Japan's stock 
market overnight and an unexpectedly strong U.S. government report on durable 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
The market had recouped most of its losses from Monday, with the Dow Jones 
industrial index up more than 21 points at one point in the session, before a 
sharp pullback in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you why it sold off," said Philip Roth, with Shearson Lehman 
Hutton Inc. "I don't know of any news. The market's technical position for a 
rally was weak. Stocks were rallying on poor volume and it was destined to fade 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Computerized trading strategies and buying by big institutions in the final 
week of the third quarter helped buoy prices during much of the session, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Columbia Pictures lost 1/8 to 26 1/4, 
USAir dipped 5/8 to 46 1/4 and Exxon fell 1/4 to 44 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Communications rose 1 1/2 to 56 1/4, MCA advanced 2 to 65 5/8 and 
Orion Pictures added 5/8 to 22 3/4. IBM gained 1 1/4 to 117 1/2 and General 
Motors advanced 1 1/8 to 48 1/4. Spain Fund showed the biggest advance, gaining 
12 to 38 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, share prices advanced broadly, pushing the Nikkei index up to a 
record high in active trading. The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues 
climbed 484.11 points to 35,444.82. The previous record, set Aug. 21, was 
35,140.83. 
</P>
<P>
Shares fell sharply in moderate trading in London after the publication of 
worse-than-expected trade figures for August. The country's current account 
deficit was $3.20 billion, the third worst on record. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 23.5 points lower 
at 2,336.1. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices recovered from a steep decline the day before, as a large auction 
of Treasury notes was absorbed more smoothly than had been expected, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose about 1/2 point, or $5 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 
8.23% from 8.28% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell sharply Monday after central banks attacked the dollar. The 
30-year bond had lost more than a point, its biggest daily decline since 
mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Finance officials from the most powerful industrial nations sold dollars from 
their reserves on Monday and Tuesday, following up their agreement over the 
weekend that the U.S. currency should not rise from current levels. The dollar 
dropped sharply as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Average yields on the notes rose to 8.39%, the highest level since May. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues were 1/16 point lower to 5/32 point higher, intermediate maturities 
advanced 7/32 point to 1/2 point, and long-term issues rose 1/2 point, 
according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.01% as the discount jumped 5 
basis points to 7.76%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.23% as the discount 
gained 3 basis points at 7.81%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.31% as the 
discount slipped 1 basis point to 7.72%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9%, down from 9.50% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
A forecast of ideal harvest weather sent some grain futures prices lower, but 
the selloff helped to bolster cattle prices. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures prices moved higher, while soybeans prices tumbled and corn 
futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade. Analysts said the 
outlook for perfect harvest weather in U.S. growing areas depressed corn and 
soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, feeder cattle prices rose, live hogs gained, precious metals 
fell and energy prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Horton, an analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago, said a lack of 
any real export demand for soybeans was weighing on futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices, however, were supported by an announcement Monday by the U.S. 
Agriculture Department of a sale to China of 300,000 metric tons and 
anticipation of more export business this week, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Activity in the corn pit was light as traders awaited a USDA grain report 
Thursday, said analyst Susan Leighty of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 2 1/4 cents to 4 1/4 cents higher, with December at $3.94 1/4 a 
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 3/4 cent higher, with December at $2.29 3/4 a 
bushel; oats were 1 1/2 cents to 2 cents higher, with December at $1.43 1/2 a 
bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent to 6 1/4 cents lower, with November at $5.66 
1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for live cattle soared, 
while feeder cattle prices were higher and pork complex futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle futures rallied on higher cash prices in Texas and Kansas, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices for precious metals fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

BRITISH AIRWAYS CHAIRMAN IS SURE U.S. WILL OK UAL DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of British Airways said Tuesday he is confident that the airline's 
$750-million investment in UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, will 
receive U.S. regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in London, British Airways Chairman John King 
said the deal was structured to comply with rules that limit foreign ownership 
of U.S. airlines. "I don't believe it poses any major problems for the U.S. 
regulatory authorities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways is backing the $6.75-billion employee buyout of UAL and will 
own 15% of the airline when the transaction is completed. Federal rules limit 
foreign investment to 25% of a U.S. carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Transportation officials have recently voiced concern about 
foreign investment and have said it is possible for a non-U.S. investor to 
exercise control over an American airline even though its ownership stake is 
under the federal limit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long List of Financial Data 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Department officials want KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, for example, 
to reduce its stake in Northwest Airlines and give up its seat on Northwest's 
board. Alfred A. Checchi, the Los Angeles financier who acquired Northwest in 
June with help from KLM, is negotiating those changes with the department. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that the Transportation Department might take 
similar steps with United Airlines, and that British Airways and the United 
employee group might be forced to restructure the deal, or reduce the price of 
the $300-a-share tender offer. The department has already asked UAL for a long 
list of financial information and for an explanation of the relationship 
between British Airways and United. 
</P>
<P>
King said Tuesday that he has received no indication that the Transportation 
Department has started to investigate the UAL transaction. "The Department of 
Transportation is looking at it as a matter of routine, just as it is looking 
at the KLM and Northwest deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department is expected to announce its decision on Northwest 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
King also emphasized that British Airways would have only one of 15 board seats 
and said its influence over the board would be minimal. Three board seats would 
go to UAL management and three to unions that join the buyout. "It is clear who 
will have control," a British Airways spokeswoman said in London. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UAL Stock Up 
</P>
<P>
King said British Airways has formed an internal committee to explore ways that 
the two airlines can work together. He said British Airways is interested in 
sharing United's terminals in Washington, Chicago and San Diego. He added that 
it is possible that United might share British Airways' terminal at John F. 
Kennedy International Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
King also said the two airlines might develop joint training facilities and 
common software for the Galileo computer reservations system. British Airways 
is one of nine European airlines that own stakes in Galileo. United owns an 
interest through Covia, a U.S. computer reservations system half-owned by 
United. 
</P>
<P>
King said British Airways would raise the equivalent of $500 million for the 
UAL investment through a rights issue for convertible bonds. The bonds are 
convertible into British Airways stock. King said British Airways would borrow 
the remaining $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's shares closed Tuesday at $276.50, up $2.50, on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

Central banks sold waves of dollars again Tuesday, but the results failed to

declined only slightly overall and actually rose against Japan's yen.

The Group of Seven industrial democracies ganged up against the dollar after 
agreeing last weekend that the dollar's rise in recent months was "inconsistent 
with longer run economic fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's intervention knocked only a fraction of a percent off the dollar's 
value, in contrast with Monday's decline of nearly six West German pfennigs and 
four Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
Some traders said the attractiveness of U.S. interest rates might bring 
investors back to dollar-denominated securities once the central bankers let 
up. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the dollar ended the day above its lows of the session. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the dollar has taken it just a little bit on the chin but it has fought 
back quite nicely," said Victor Polce, vice president and manager of corporate 
foreign exchange at Algemene Bank Nederland NV in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers agreed that most of the major government banks had sold dollars, but 
they disagreed on how large the sales were. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dollar's drop against the West German mark came from continued 
speculation that the West German central bank would raise a key interest rate 
next month, drawing global investors away from dollars and into marks. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen because fewer people 
expected the Bank of Japan to raise rates, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven consists of the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, 
Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
British Pound Gains 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.15 Japanese yen to a closing 142.80 yen from 142.95 
yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it fell further to 142.50 yen. In New 
York, it rose to 142.35 yen from 142.13 yen on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6215 from $1.6080 late Monday despite 
Tuesday's announcement of a worse-than-expected merchandise trade deficit of 
2.29 billion pounds, or $3.69 billion, in August. In New York, the pound rose 
to $1.6190 from $1.6175 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Monday's late rates, included: 
1.8918 West German marks, down from 1.8990; 1.6415 Swiss francs, down from 
1.6480; 1.1756 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1763; 6.4110 French francs, down 
from 6.4370, and 1,366.9 Italian lire, down from 1,372.9. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Monday, included: 1.8885 
West German marks, down from 1.9055; 1.6390 Swiss francs, down from 1.6565; 
6.3990 French francs, down from 6.4540; 2.1480 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 
1,377.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1750 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.1776. 
</P>
<P>
Gold rose in thin London trading to a late bid of $367.75 an ounce from $367 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose to $367.75 from $366.75. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 33 cents an ounce to a closing bid of $367.53. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell 
to $368.50 from $369.80. Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold 
was bid at $367.30 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $368. 
</P>
<P>
Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.31 an ounce from $5.27 late 
Monday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $5.263 
from $5.283.

Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. and Sovran Financial Corp. announced a 
$4.7-billion merger Tuesday that will create the nation's 14th-largest banking 
company. 
</P>
<P>
C&amp;S, based in Atlanta, and Sovran, based in Norfolk, Va., will have total 
assets of $47 billion and almost 1,000 offices in seven states from Maryland to 
Florida. Under a newly formed holding company called Avantor Financial Corp., 
the two banks plan to maintain dual headquarters and retain current management. 
</P>
<P>
The merger comes five months after C&amp;S fought off a takeover bid by North 
Carolina's NCNB Corp. Unlike that proposal, the C&amp;S-Sovran deal is a 
friendly merger.

CHEVRON FINED $877,000 FOR REFINERY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Labor Department said Tuesday that it would fine Chevron U.S.A. Inc. 
$877,000 for 114 alleged safety violations in connection with an April fire at 
the company's Richmond, Calif., refinery that seriously burned three workers. 
</P>
<P>
The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleged that 
Chevron knew or should have known of safety hazards, including a need for 
fire-resistant or protective clothing but did nothing to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
"The great tragedy of these injuries is that they were avoidable," said Labor 
Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd Largest Assessed 
</P>
<P>
Chevron, which has 15 days to appeal the proposed penalties, denied the 
allegations and said it would vigorously contest them. "We are dismayed by 
OSHA's misleading and inaccurate explanation of the alleged violations," said 
Chevron U.S.A. President Will Price in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The fines would be the second largest assessed against an employer in 
California by OSHA since July, 1987, when the agency assumed duties previously 
performed by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said 
Christopher Lee, OSHA's acting regional administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The largest fine in that period was $1.49 million assessed against Lockheed 
Aeronautical Systems Co. in Burbank for record-keeping and other violations, 
Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vindication," said Jeffrey Dodge, field representative for Local 1-5 of 
the Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers International Union, which represents 
about 850 Chevron workers at Richmond. OSHA said that individual employees and 
union representatives have been seeking protective clothing and equipment for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Chevron fire started April 10, when a pipe carrying pressurized hydrogen 
gas burst a seam. The resulting fire and explosion weakened a 100-foot-tall 
reactor, which collapsed and engulfed four workers in flames. Three, who were 
wearing no fire-resistant clothing, suffered second- and third-degree burns on 
up to 70% of their bodies, OSHA found in its subsequent investigation of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious Violations' 
</P>
<P>
The fourth employee, who was wearing fire-resistant clothing, suffered only 
minor burns on his face, OSHA said. Five other employees suffered less serious 
injuries, OSHA reported. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA is citing Chevron with 109 "willful violations" -- one for each of 109 
employees who were expected to fight fires or assist in fighting fires but who 
did not receive protective clothing, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties for those violations amount to $872,000. OSHA defined a willful 
violation as one in which an employer knew of a hazard but made no reasonable 
effort to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, OSHA is citing Chevron with five "serious violations," each 
carrying a penalty of $1,000. They include failing to provide fire-resistant 
coveralls to refinery personnel. The agency defined a serious violation as one 
in which there is a substantial probability that death or serious injury could 
result from a condition, and the employer knew or should have known of the 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron disputed the need to provide fire protective clothing to employees, 
although a spokesman admitted the company has changed its policy to provide 
fire resistant coveralls to some refinery personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The refinery has resumed production at its normal level of 265,000 barrels a 
day, though the damaged equipment remains out of service, said Chevron 
spokesman Mike Libbey.

TEAM OF SOVIET EXPERTS TO TOUR O.C. 'STAR WARS' LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY and MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Star Wars" laser-testing facility in San Juan Capistrano will roll out the 
red carpet for visiting Soviet technical experts, according to the United 
States' chief negotiator at space defense talks in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
However, the top secret research project remained off limits Tuesday when the 
U.S. Air Force denied a request for a tour of the facility by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials in Washington "were aware an invitation has been made to 
the Soviets," said Juventino Garcia, civilian director of public affairs for 
the Air Force Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, 
N.M., which manages the project. TRW Inc. of Redondo Beach operates the testing 
facility under a government contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Until more is learned, the Air Force policy about keeping Alpha facilities 
closed to the public is still in effect," Garcia said. So-called Alpha 
facilities conduct laser research. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. invitation was seen as a bid to defuse Soviet resistance to U.S. 
missile defense research. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday, Soviet and American arms negotiators in Geneva are expected 
to hammer out details of the visit, which would open the TRW lab in San Juan 
Capistrano and a U.S. Energy Department lab in New Mexico to as many as 10 
Soviet specialists. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that the Soviets will accept this invitation," said Ambassador 
Henry F. Cooper, chief U.S. negotiator at the Defense in Space Talks in Geneva. 
"It was made without conditions, but we hope that it will provide a basis then 
for discussions in Geneva that will lead them to accept an exchange in the 
future of such visits." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III proposed the Soviet visit during a 
weekend huddle with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, who responded 
positively, according to U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Government is eager to gain access to Soviet laboratories engaged in 
missile defense research, which they hope will flow from Baker's initiative. In 
recent months, the Soviets have opened several of their most sensitive 
facilities to visiting U.S. lawmakers and arms control proponents, who 
concluded that the Pentagon has overplayed the Soviet "Star Wars" program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the intelligence community has learned things they have not known 
before because they got closer" to Soviet facilities, Cooper said. But he 
contested claims that the Soviet "Star Wars" effort has been less potent than 
advertised. 
</P>
<P>
"They are still working quite deliberately in this area," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the Soviets "have explicitly complained in the past" about work 
under way at the TRW facility and at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, the 
other site proposed for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
In April 1989 the high-powered laser was successfully tested at the 2,000-acre 
site at 32502 Avenida Pico on unincorporated county land in the San Clemente 
hills near the San Diego County border. The facility is barely visible from the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the contract, they were supposed to lase three times," Garcia said 
Tuesday. "Lasing is essentially firing. . . . I believe two of the three lases 
have been completed." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 7, 1988, a flash fire broke out at the San Juan Capistrano test site 
that delayed testing of the Alpha laser. A worker had opened a valve at the 
wrong time causing a brief but intense fire in the piping at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The fire delayed testing about three months. Following the fire, portions of 
the facility's fluid supply system were redesigned and test procedures improved 
to avoid a recurrence, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Alpha chemical laser would be a component of the Strategic Defense 
Initiative's "Zenith Star" program. Zenith Star is an effort to develop a 
satellite-based laser that would pick off missiles in mid-trajectory. It is now 
undergoing ground-based tests within the sprawling TRW facility. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Alamos, Soviet visitors would be permitted to see a neutral particle 
beam laser placed aboard a rocket in "Star Wars" experiments. The research 
laser has been tested extensively, provoking Soviet protests. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the Soviet visitors would be able to learn more from a visit to the 
two labs than they could glean from their overhead satellites. But John Pike, 
an analyst for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists, said the 
Soviets would likely learn little more than they can read in the transcripts of 
congressional hearings and defense trade magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the sort of stuff you can find out from wandering around and kicking 
the tires in facilities like these is stuff you can find in the open 
literature," Pike said. "The process is probably more important than the 
content." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the broad appeal of Baker's proposal among American arms control 
experts, Pike said, is that "there's basically no downside to this. There's 
something in it for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Private firms that do business with the Pentagon, however, have rarely welcomed 
visits by Soviet experts. During negotiations that led to the 1987 Intermediate 
Nuclear Forces, or INF Treaty, firms that were potentially subject to 
short-notice Soviet inspection feared that security could be jeopardized and 
the Pentagon would stay away. 
</P>
<P>
TRW spokesman Julian Levine, however, declined to discuss the effects of the 
Soviet visit on the firm's defense-related business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a government-to-government issue," said Levine, vice president of 
communications for TRW's Space and Defense Sector. "We have been advised of it, 
and would be pleased to cooperate" when notified of the outcome of forthcoming 
talks in Geneva.

BROTHERS SENTENCED FOR ROLES IN DRUG CARTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge this week sent two Costa Mesa brothers to prison for helping run what 
prosecutors described as one of the biggest marijuana businesses in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Mack Fowlie, 30, received a 3 1/2-year sentence from Judge Alicemarie H. 
Stotler in U.S. District Court on Monday, while brother Gus got two years. Each 
had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to import and distribute 
marijuana, while other drug counts against them were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was slightly less than had been sought by federal prosecutors, but 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Umberg termed it "a just sentence." 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't the organizers of the conspiracy, but they were cogs in the 
drug-running business," Umberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers were accused of having helped distribute hundreds of thousands of 
pounds of marijuana -- worth millions of dollars -- around the country, using a 
sprawling ranch in Rancho del Rio at the borders of Orange and Riverside 
counties as a base. The ranch was seized by federal authorities last year and 
was used by President Bush as a stage for an anti-drug speech this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. Fowlie, father of the defendants and the alleged mastermind of the 
family drug business, is in Mexico awaiting extradition to the United States on 
separate drug charges, Umberg said.

UCI'S TIEN HONORED BY GROUP OF SCHOLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine Executive Vice Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien has been named Most 
Distinguished Chinese Scholar by the Society of Hong Kong Scholars. 
</P>
<P>
Tien, the university's second-ranking executive, is a mechanical engineer and 
an internationally recognized expert on heat transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Tien played a key role in efforts to prevent heat-shielding tiles from falling 
off U.S. space shuttles as a consultant for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and helped to assess the damage after the Three Mile Island 
nuclear accident a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI scholar, who fled China with his family when Communists came to power 
in 1949, was honored for his work as an educator and researcher and his "keen 
sense of social affairs in the world and in China." 
</P>
<P>
The award was presented recently at a ceremony in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased to be recognized by SHKS for my work in this area," Tien 
said. "The accolade has special significance to me because of the society's 
commitment to extend communication on important scholarly and humanitarian 
issues across national boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
Tien, who was born in Wuhan in east-central China, received his undergraduate 
degree at National Taiwan University and his doctorate from Princeton 
University. Before coming to UCI in 1988, Tien held the Berlin Chair in 
Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, where he was also vice chancellor for 
research.

SHERIFF'S DEPT. WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR 2 TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending a 3-year-old dispute over an accounting matter, the Board of Supervisors 
Tuesday unanimously agreed to reimburse the Sheriff's Department for $477.96, 
the cost of two trips taken by Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
On separate trips that year to Sacramento and Visalia, Gates was flown by his 
department's Aero Squadron Reserve Unit rather than commercial jets. Gates 
opted to use the special aviation unit -- a volunteer group of deputized 
private pilots and planes -- because he said it was more convenient than using 
a commercial carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteer pilots provide their personal aircraft for department assignments 
without pay, though the pilots are reimbursed for fuel. The fuel costs for 
Gates' two trips, both involving department business, was $477.96. Commercial 
flights to both destinations would have cost $392. 
</P>
<P>
Gates paid the private pilots out of the Sheriff's Department petty cash fund, 
but when he sought reimbursement from the county, he was rebuffed. County 
auditors said the trips violated county government's travel policy because the 
personal escort cost more than a commercial flight. 
</P>
<P>
But last month, the county administrative office recommended that the 
supervisors reimburse the Sheriff's Department for the two trips. On Tuesday, 
the board voted, 4 to 0, to pay the money and end the accounting dispute. Board 
members did not discuss the issue before taking the vote.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRABUCO CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS TO WEIGH 5 KEY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Planning Commission decided Tuesday to consider five development 
proposals, including an ambitious plan to build a $55-million church with 4,800 
seats near Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The projects are involved in a larger debate over development of a 6,500-acre 
swath of backcountry northeast of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, in a bid to give supporters of the projects some direction, 
said it will take a straw vote on each proposal at its Oct. 10 meeting. Among 
the projects are two new church complexes, both on Santiago Canyon Road; two 
neighborhood shopping centers on opposite corners of Live Oak Canyon and 
Santiago Canyon roads, and a 68-unit housing development on 69 acres next to 
Seventh-day Adventist church property. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial of the proposals is Saddleback Valley Community Church's 
plan to build a seven-story sanctuary with parking for 2,200 vehicles on a 
113-acre parcel bordering Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the site, north of Cook's Corner (where Santiago Canyon Road and 
Live Oak Canyon Road merge and become El Toro Road) and east of Portola Hills, 
is one of the few locales large enough in southern Orange County to accommodate 
the parish's growth and programs. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, however, say the project is too urbanized for the area and 
would mean significant grading and destruction of oak trees, many of them 
several centuries old. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on a sweeping plan for general development in the Foothill-Trabuco 
area, including limits on construction of new homes, is not expected until 
early next year.

SANTIAGO CANYON ROAD STUDY; 
</P>
<P>
LIGHTS IN DAYTIME CUT ACCIDENT RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The accident rate on Santiago Canyon Road dropped 58% after a program 
encouraging drivers to use headlights during the daylight hours was introduced, 
a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents rates are computed on the number of accidents per million vehicle 
miles. The total number of accidents on the 13-mile stretch of two-lane highway 
between Orange and Trabuco Canyon decreased by seven in 1987 and 1988 compared 
to the previous two-year period, despite a more than 100% increase in the daily 
traffic volume, according to the study. The number of accidents dropped from 81 
to 74. No statistics were provided on numbers of deaths and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The study is the first comparing accident trends since daytime headlight 
programs were implemented throughout Orange County over the past five years. 
Other programs are in effect on the Ortega Highway and Laguna Canyon Road. 
While use of daytime headlights is voluntary, surveys by police and county 
engineers show a compliance rate of between 50% and 70%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Outstanding Program' 
</P>
<P>
A county engineer who conducted the study cautioned that due to drastic changes 
in traffic volume and patterns, the study is not scientific. 
</P>
<P>
But law enforcement officials said the findings reinforce their belief that the 
headlight program is succeeding in reducing accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an outstanding program for our area," said Officer Mike Lundquist, 
spokesman for the Santa Ana division of the California Highway Patrol. 
Lundquist said the 58% reduction is "probably one of the highest in the state." 
</P>
<P>
While more recent accident figures are not available, Lundquist said the trend 
appears to continue downward. CHP Motorcycle Officer Wally Seibert, for 
example, said he has noticed a decrease in accidents in his early-morning 
patrols of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (daytime headlights) work," Seibert said. "It's a visual thing. 
It's like with motorcycles. Someone sees that your headlights are on and it's 
easier to see the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans posted signs asking for daytime headlights along Santiago Canyon Road 
in September, 1986, at the request of the California Highway Patrol, after 10 
fatalities and 109 injuries resulted from traffic accidents there between Jan. 
1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1985. Although the roadway's overall accident rate at the 
time was well below state averages, the severity of accidents was such that 
Capt. C.A. Lynd of the CHP's Santa Ana division asked for the signs. 
</P>
<P>
A CalTrans study at the time of 10 other headlight programs outside of Orange 
County found that the total accident rate was reduced 18% after the posting of 
headlight signs. 
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Canyon Road study, completed Aug. 1, found even more dramatic 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
James Swatzel, a county senior civil engineer who conducted the study, also 
documented significant reductions in types of accidents. Accidents in which 
vehicles were sideswiped decreased from 16 in the previous two-year period to 
nine in the next two-year period, the report found. The number of accidents 
involving overturned vehicles dropped from 16 to six over the same time 
periods. And accidents related to unsafe speed decreased from 25 to 19, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Although some accident categories showed small increases, Swatzel noted that 
there had been such a large increase in traffic on the roadway that a net 
reduction in the accident rate still occurred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Volume Doubled 
</P>
<P>
The traffic volume doubled from 6,000 vehicles per day to 12,000 vehicles per 
day in one six-mile stretch of road between Silverado Canyon and Live Oak 
Canyon, the report found. Traffic volume on the remaining seven-mile stretch 
between Silverado Canyon and Chapman Road increased from 11,000 vehicles daily 
to 16,000, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no similar studies have been conducted on Ortega Highway or Laguna 
Canyon Road, law enforcement officers there say they are also seeing accident 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The signs went up in June, 1985, along a 14-mile stretch of Ortega Highway, 
where CHP statistics showed there were 87 major accidents resulting in 95 
injuries and four deaths during 1984. Headlight signs also went up in 1984 on a 
five-mile stretch of Laguna Canyon Road between the San Diego Freeway and El 
Toro Road because of a concentration of serious accidents there. 
</P>
<P>
Headlight signs "make people more aware that this is a problem area and it 
makes oncoming vehicles more visible," said Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Linda 
Parker. "It makes them more alert." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Estimated at 25% 
</P>
<P>
Use of headlight signs and a CHP radar enforcement program have combined to 
reduce accidents along the Ortega Highway by as much as 25%, said Lt. Michael 
Bair of the CHP office in San Juan Capistrano. Bair said the figure was an 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the headlight program is helping not so much for visibility but to 
remind drivers . . . that there is something a little unique about driving this 
highway," Bair said. 
</P>
<P>
As successful as the headlight programs seem to be, Swatzel warned in his 
report that the lights should not be considered a general solution. It is the 
fact that the lights are unusual that gets the attention of drivers, Swatzel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any proliferation of this method will render it completely ineffective, he 
said." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daylight Headlights Reduce Accidents 
</P>
<P>
Accidents along Santiago Canyon Road between Chapman Avenue and Live Oak Canyon 
Raod decreased dramatically when drivers were asked during a test period to use 
their headlights during daylight hours. Despite a 100% increase in traffic in a 
portion of the road between that period and a period which headlights were not 
required, the daylight headlight test indicated an overall accident rate 
reduction of about 58%

SUSPECT DETAINED; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY QUESTIONED IN DEATH OF BRUISED BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police were questioning the family of an 11-month-old girl whose badly bruised 
body was found Tuesday in their Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was pending to determine whether the baby girl was beaten to death, 
according to Santa Ana police, who are investigating the child's death as a 
possible homicide. If death was the result of a beating, she would be the third 
child to have died of abuse in Orange County this year. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police said a suspect "has been detained" in connection with the 
infant's death, but police declined to give further information Tuesday night, 
or to say whether the suspect was related to the child. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Complicated Investigation' 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, authorities said the infant's 5-year-old brother is being held in 
protective custody at the Orangewood Children's Home after being treated for 
cuts to the mouth at Saint Joseph Hospital in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a very complicated investigation," said Santa Ana police 
spokeswoman Maureen Thomas, who said the parents and other relatives had been 
interviewed. She refused to identify them. Thomas said police would not know 
the cause of death until the autopsy results are available. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's a homicide," she said. "All we have at this point is 
really a dead body." 
</P>
<P>
The baby's death comes at a time when reports of child abuse in Orange County 
have reached an all-time high. Reported cases of abuse for the year ending in 
July are up 8% over the previous 12-month period and up nearly 25% since the 
year before that, according to data compiled by the Orange County Child Abuse 
Registry. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they believe the rise reflects both an increase in the actual 
number of children abused and increased reporting of suspected abuse due to 
growing public awareness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the Durant Court apartments at 7:45 a.m. Tuesday by a 
woman who told them her daughter was dead. When officers arrived at the large 
complex in the 1500 block of North Durant Street, they found the baby girl in a 
bedroom, not breathing, with "obvious signs of trauma to the head and body," 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics who were summoned pronounced the infant dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor interviewed Tuesday afternoon reported hearing the doors in the 
apartment where the baby lived being slammed Monday night, as though in anger. 
The neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said he sometimes heard a baby 
crying in the apartment but was never alarmed because the crying did not sound 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Durant Court is a modern apartment complex built 14 months ago as part of a 
Santa Ana redevelopment program. It is home to 83 mostly middle-class families 
of all ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
No one was home Tuesday evening at the apartment where the child lived, and the 
parents could not be reached for comment. But on the patio were a child's 
walker, plastic toys and an upturned mop, amid discarded ribbons that said, 
"Police line, do not cross." 
</P>
<P>
Through an open curtain, clothes, toys and articles of clothing could be seen 
strewn on the floor of the bedroom where the baby's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine anybody doing such harm to another human being, let alone a 
helpless baby," said next-door neighbor Uriel Ortiz, 26, as he stroked his own 
2-month-old daughter. "This is a nice, peaceful place." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said a juvenile court hearing would be conducted, probably 
Thursday, to determine whether the 5-year-old boy should be returned to the 
custody of his parents or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County reports of child abuse have jumped since 1985, the 
number of children who die of abuse each year has remained about the same. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1987, about 15,000 children were believed to have been abused, 
neglected or abandoned each year. The number of such reports rose to about 
19,000 cases in 1988. Through August of this year, there have been 11,550 such 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Reporting 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Nishimoto, program manager for emergency response services at the Orange 
County Social Services Agency, said the increase probably reflects better 
reporting by teachers, police, doctors, social workers -- and even companies 
that process film -- all of whom are required to notify authorities if they 
suspect abuse. 
</P>
<P>
But he also blamed abuse of alcohol and drugs, familial stress and the growing 
number of parents who were themselves abused as children. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like people do it because they do not see the child as a human 
being," Nishimoto said. "They dehumanize the kid, they objectify them until 
there are no emotions attached to the child. It just becomes an object they 
mistreat." 
</P>
<P>
The increase in reporting, however, would appear to be helping to keep down the 
number of children who actually die as the result of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Five children died of child abuse in Orange County in 1985, three in 1986, five 
in 1987, two in 1988, and two, not including Monday's death, so far this year, 
Nishimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures, though tragic, are among the lowest in the state, said William 
G. Steiner, executive director of the Orangewood Children's Foundation and a 
former director of the home, which takes in 2,900 abused and neglected children 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen years ago, we had 19 suspected child abuse deaths (each year) with a 
million fewer people in Orange County," Steiner said. "Three this year is three 
too many. But the county has made some tremendous strides in protecting 
children over the last 15 years."

BUENA PARK URGES FAA TO INVESTIGATE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH CARPENTIER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alarmed over a rash of crashes involving small planes based at Fullerton 
Municipal Airport, Buena Park officials Tuesday asked the Federal Aviation 
Administration to take a close look at the facility to determine if it is more 
hazardous than other, similar-size airports. 
</P>
<P>
The request came in a letter from Mayor Donna L. Chessen to Jerold Chavkin, 
regional administrator of the FAA in Hawthorne. In it, Chessen asked the FAA to 
further investigate "numerous crashes of aircraft in the city of Buena Park 
over the past few years." 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident came Sept. 13 when a two-seat Cessna 152, carrying an 
instructor and a student pilot, lost power about a minute after takeoff and 
crashed at the intersection of Artesia Boulevard and Darlington Street in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Both the student pilot and instructor were injured in the crash, which Buena 
Park officials said was the 11th in Buena Park since 1966. Although Fullerton 
officials have maintained that the airport is safe, some members of the Buena 
Park City Council have called for it to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No More of a Risk 
</P>
<P>
"We have repeatedly stated our alarm over the situation," Chessen wrote in the 
letter. "Our statements have been responded to by the city of Fullerton and the 
Federal Aviation Administration in a manner which gives the impression that 
those institutions consider the aircraft crashes in Buena Park as 'normal' and 
as presenting no more of a risk than the flow of vehicular traffic through the 
city of Buena Park." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton officials could not be reached for comment on the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Chessen asked the FAA to conduct a study comparing the Fullerton facility with 
other general aviation airports in the region. That study, she said, should 
look at the number of crashes at each facility, where the accidents occurred, 
the number and types of injuries and fatalities and the number of accidents 
believed caused by "errors in aircraft maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FAA was asked to determine "damage to real property" in each 
accident, the level of aircraft maintenance and inspections by airport FAA 
staff at each facility and the number of accidents that occur during pilot 
instruction programs and student solo flights. 
</P>
<P>
Chessen said late Tuesday the letter was written to express the fear shared by 
many Buena Park residents over the rash of crashes in their city. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they'll take us seriously this time," Chessen said. "We have never had 
anything in writing before. I hope this letter will prompt real action."

GARDEN GROVE MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO WOMAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old Garden Grove man has pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the 
stabbing death last April of a woman he had known since high school. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron Seaholm is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 6 for the murder of Denise 
Duerr, 21, also of Garden Grove. Duerr's body was found April 19 on a hillside 
near Corona. She had been repeatedly stabbed with an ice pick-like tool. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm faces a sentence of between 25 years and life in prison under terms of 
the guilty plea entered Monday in Riverside County Municipal Court. Prosecutors 
said he will be eligible for parole in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel C. Lough, deputy district attorney for Riverside County, said Seaholm 
decided to plead guilty after he was told that prosecutors might also charge 
him with rape. Adding a rape charge would have made Seaholm eligible for a 
sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, Lough said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a situation where there was that possibility and it's not a possibility 
he was interested in waiting to find out," Lough said. "He pleaded guilty to 
first-degree murder because that's what he's guilty of." 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm was arrested on suspicion of the slaying along with Duerr's boyfriend, 
Clyde Spontak, shortly after her body was discovered April 19. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against Spontak were dropped Aug. 30, however, when investigators 
verified that he had been selling cocaine at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Lough said Spontak had originally given investigators several false statements 
about his whereabouts at the time of the death, causing them to suspect that he 
was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm was arrested at his stepfather's house at Lake Elsinore. Duerr's car 
was at the home when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm, Spontak and Duerr were all high school friends from Garden Grove. 
Lough said they were also sharing an apartment before the murder.

CYPRESS FINDS SMOOTH SAILING IN WATER POLO

<P>
Cypress College is joining the ranks of the Southland's top water polo teams. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West, Long Beach, Orange Coast and Saddleback recently have been 
considered among the best programs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Cypress is making a move. The Chargers are 8-2 overall and 1-1 in Orange 
Empire Conference play. Cypress needs four more victories this season to equal 
its best total in the four previous years under Coach Howie Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
A walk-on coach who teaches at Bolsa Grande High School, Clarke was an 
assistant to Jim Steveson from 1973-84 before taking over the program when 
Steveson decided to concentrate on coaching swimming. Clarke's first team was 
2-27, including 11 victories forfeited for using an ineligible player. Cypress 
was 3-24 overall and 0-14 in the Orange Empire Conference in 1986, improved to 
8-19 and 4-10 the following year and 12-14 and 4-8 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"This season has been a long time coming," Clarke said. "But we realize we 
still have a long way to go to get to the top." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Banhidy was a first-team all-conference player last season, Craig 
Shimomura was a second-team pick and Eric Coolbaugh was named honorable 
mention. Pat Ruzgerian is back and much improved as a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Walsh, who was an All-American at Cypress in 1987, is back after sitting 
out last season for personal reasons. Craig Garcia, a sophomore, has 
transferred from defending state champion Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress faced some of the better teams in Southern California last week in the 
San Diego Mesa tournament. Cypress surprised Saddleback, the defending Orange 
Empire Conference champion, in one semifinal match, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress then played long-time county power Golden West in the final and lost, 
14-6. Golden West has won seven state titles, including five in a row from 
1978-82. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a long way to go to beat a team like Golden West," Clarke said. 
"But we've been in the pool with them and we know what it's like to play them." 
</P>
<P>
Southland poll: El Camino (2-0) moved to the top of the Southland football poll 
this week in the wake of Fullerton's 28-23 lose to Cerritos Saturday. El 
Camino, second last week, defeated Orange Coast, 36-17, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Antonio (2-0) is second, Cerritos (2-0-1) third, Rancho Santiago (2-0) 
fourth, Fullerton (1-1) fifth, Bakersfield (1-0-1) sixth, Moorpark (2-0) 
seventh, Long Beach (2-0) eighth, Santa Monica (2-0) ninth and Riverside (2-0) 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
Tough start: Saddleback's football team is 0-2, losing to San Diego Mesa and 
Grossmont, both by scores of 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
That has happened only three times since the program started in 1968. 
Saddleback was 0-2 in 1968 and again in 1976, which was Swearingen's first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The only time Saddleback started 0-3 was in 1986 when the Gauchos forfeited 
three victories for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback will try an avoid an 0-3 start when the Gauchos play host to Palomar 
Saturday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to figure out something," Swearingen said. "I just don't know right 
know what that something is, but it is time for drastic action before it gets 
too late." 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback must play four teams ranked in the Southland poll -- Mt. San 
Antonio, Fullerton, Riverside and Rancho Santiago -- in its final eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bill Price, who coached at Cypress for 22 years, has retired. Price coached 
golf for the past 17 seasons, and was the football coach from 1970-72. Marian 
Dorn moves from women's tennis coach to replace Price as golf coach. Ron 
Johnson will be the walk-on women's tennis coach. . . . Nick-John Haiduc of 
Fullerton had 255 yards in all-purpose offense in Fullerton's 28-23 loss to 
Cerritos Saturday. He had seven pass receptions for 109 yards and two 
touchdowns. He returned two punts for 66 yards, including a 55-yard scoring 
play. He also had 80 yards in three kickoff returns . . . Rancho Santiago 
quarterback Scott Wood missed last Saturday's 51-13 victory over San Diego City 
with the flu. He is expected to play this week against Long Beach.

UC IRVINE GIVES CAINE NEW JOB, WILL SEARCH FOR ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine Athletic Director John Caine was appointed Tuesday as Chancellor Jack 
Peltason's special assistant for athletic policy and planning. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason said a nationwide search for a new athletic director will begin in 
"five to six days," after the formation of a search committee. The chancellor 
said he hoped to have a replacement by "the spring." 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor for student affairs, will be 
acting athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine officials insisted that Caine, who will soon turn 65, was not being 
kicked upstairs. The move seems to come at an inopportune time, however, 
considering that two other top athletic department administrators -- associate 
athletic directors Rob Halvaks (who was responsible for business management) 
and Craig Fertig (the athletic fund-raiser) -- had resigned in the past three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing seems pretty bad to me," said one Irvine athletic administrator who 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he had a choice in the decision, Caine replied that he was taking 
on the new position "as a result of the chancellor's invitation." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be timely for me to move on to this new responsibility," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason stressed the importance of Caine's new job and downplayed the recent 
upheaval in the athletic department's top-level management, saying it does not 
represent a "crisis." 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the recent Regental approval of the UCI Long Range Development Plan, 
which shows UCI to have an enrollment of 26,000 by the year 2005, we need an 
experienced person to plan the strategy for the growth of the intercollegiate 
and recreational programs over the next 15 years," Peltason said. "I'm very 
happy to have John coming to work with me." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there had been any thought to keeping Caine in place until a successor 
had been named, Mitchell said that planning for the future was more important 
than the immediate need for direction in the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of priorities," he said, "and the greatest priority is on the 
future. We can manage on an interim basis." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason admitted that "we do lack strength (in athletic administration)" and 
said he planned to move as promptly as feasible in the search for Caine's 
successor. The two vacant associate athletic director spots will be filled soon 
thereafter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that it would make sense to have the new AD in place before we 
moved to fill those other two positions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Tift, a former men's basketball coach and longtime faculty member, will 
serve as acting chair of the physical education department, a job which had 
been part of the athletic director's duties. And Peltason said that the 
athletic department would not lose Caine's knowledge or experience. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll still be here," he said, "but I didn't want to double-team him with the 
day-to-day responsibilities of running the department. John will be dealing 
with major decisions that will have consequences on the university over 100 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Caine came to Irvine in 1983 and has been director of athletics at the 
University of Oregon (1976-81), San Jose State (1972-76) and Cal State 
Fullerton (1968-72). 
</P>
<P>
While Caine is pondering the future, the incoming athletic director will be 
faced with a budget deficit that has continued to increase over the past 
decade. The school is finally moving to solve that problem, however. 
</P>
<P>
"(The school administration's) recognition (of the athletic department's 
monetary problems) is the most important thing that has happened here in the 
last 12 months," Caine said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who has been Caine's immediate supervisor and says he is up to date 
on the issues and challenges facing the athletic department, said the 
university already has taken steps to rectify the budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize that when we moved to Division I, we did not commit the necessary 
funds to compete in that arena. But we have put together a five-year plan to 
retire the deficit from other campus sources and we intend to add new revenue 
on a yearly basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason: "We are committed to having a Division-I program that is 
comprehensive and competitive . . . but to this point, it hasn't been 
adequately funded." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Caine's job will be to research the feasibility of adding a football 
program at Irvine, as well as planning for new facilities, such as a campus 
recreation building and an Olympic-quality pool. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people want (football) and a lot of people are apprehensive about 
it," Peltason said. "It's an issue that won't go away. I'm not plotting or 
planning, but I think it needs to be openly addressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the time is here, we just need to think about it. But until we 
get existing programs adequately funded, it doesn't make sense to add another."

UNITED WESTERN MEDICAL CENTERS ON MEND AFTER DOSE OF COST-CUTTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A United Western Medical Centers vice president was driving his BMW company car 
into the parking lot of the organization's Santa Ana corporate headquarters 
last December when he heard something that caused him to veer into a concrete 
bumper. 
</P>
<P>
He had been informed by one of the company's newly appointed administrators, 
who was sitting next to him, that the fleet of 15 fancy company cars assigned 
to hospital brass was about to be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'That's a great idea.' But his actions betrayed his real feelings,' " 
recalled Charles S. Mack Jr., who had just become the hospital organization's 
chief operating officer when he advised the executive of the new cost-cutting 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recruited by Directors 
</P>
<P>
Doing away with company cars was symbolic of many more far-ranging changes that 
Mack and his partner, Douglas L. Drumwright, have initiated at United Western 
since Dec. 6 when they took over the financially faltering operations of the 
nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mack and Drumwright were recruited by United Western's board of directors to 
replace Wayne Schroeder, who resigned after serving as president of United 
Western for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
United Western directors said in recent interviews that late last year they 
realized an immediate change in management was necessary to avert financial 
disaster. Schroeder, they said, was an "optimist" and a "visionary" who had 
been spending large sums of money on initiating new medical and advertising 
programs at a time when the organization instead desperately needed to 
retrench. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who runs a consulting business out of his home in Santa Ana, refuses 
to directly address criticisms of his performance at United Western. He says 
only that he is proud of his record. "At the time I left," he contends, "the 
hospitals had a bright future." 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said company officials. For the fiscal year ended March 31, the 
hospital lost $30 million to $35 million and was on the brink of bankruptcy, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
But the losses have slowed -- the company made a slight profit in July and 
August -- and company officials say it will be in the black by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The heroes of the turnaround are Mack and Drumwright, United Western's chief 
executive officer. In just 10 months they have nursed United Western -- which 
runs a 327-bed hospital in Santa Ana and a 248-bed hospital and 241-bed 
skilled-nursing facility in Anaheim -- back to financial health. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were pretty dismal when they got there and the turnaround has been 
nothing short of phenomenal," said United Western director Thomas C. Hill. 
</P>
<P>
And partly on the strength of United Western's recovery, Mack and Drumwright 
recently got a contract to take over the administration of Care Enterprises 
Inc., a Tustin nursing home chain, as it struggles to reorganize and emerge 
from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Like hospitals nationwide, United Western's have had their profit margins 
squeezed by the cost-containment requirements of government and private medical 
insurers. Last year 53% of California hospitals lost money, according to the 
California Assn. of Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
At United Western the financial bleeding was a massive hemorrhage. "In December 
and January bankruptcy was a real option and we told the employees that. We 
think honesty is the best policy," said Drumwright. 
</P>
<P>
During its last fiscal year, the organization suffered a huge loss. Drumwright 
said the company had an operating loss of $20 million and another $10 million 
from writedowns of hospital assets and of a bond refinancing for the Anaheim 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The financial deterioration did not happen overnight. Hill, who is an 
accountant and member of United Western's finance committee, said the 
organization would have posted a $4-million loss in fiscal 1988 had it not 
overestimated the amount of receipts the hospital would receive from Medi-Cal 
and Medicare. Instead, it posted net income of $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Until they came to United Western, Drumwright and Mack had no experience in 
running a hospital. But they had other business experience that they thought 
would apply. In their resumes, Drumwright said he prepared a turnaround plan 
for Castle &amp; Cook, the giant Los Angeles-based international food company, 
and Mack cited his stint as chief financial officer of a health-care company 
during its transition from losing money to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Drumwright, 44, and Mack, 38, recall with humor that their first joint business 
in 1983, a "doc-in-the-box" business in Northern California, was a flop. "It 
was our first start-up and liquidation in the first year," Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
But through it all, they contend, they have learned a lot about managing 
troubled companies. A year ago they teamed up and formed Alpha Partners to work 
with start-up and failing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Financial Officer 
</P>
<P>
Drumwright and Mack took the helm of United Western and abruptly changed its 
course, the company's directors said. They hired a new chief financial officer 
and restructured the organization's finance department. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they changed management at all three facilities. And throughout the 
organization they laid off about 300 people -- mostly management, professional 
and clerical staff -- got agreements to delay payments to vendors, dropped a 
money-losing Medi-Cal contract and generally quashed the previous management's 
exuberant spending. 
</P>
<P>
A monument to the spendthrift tendency of the former management, hospital 
officials say, are the elaborate corporate offices, redecorated at great 
expense several years ago in a modern gray and mauve motif. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Woo, chief of staff at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, credited 
Schroeder, whom he described as "a charismatic dynamo," for greatly improving 
the stature of United Western over the years. He praised Schroeder for helping 
to establish the Santa Ana hospital's trauma and renal transplant programs. 
"These are the things that put Western Medical on the map in Orange County," 
Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that in the last year Schroeder had launched numerous costly new 
projects, frequently with little support from the medical staff. These 
programs, including plans for a 24-hour cancer center and high-tech "gamma 
knife" radiation therapy to treat brain tumors, were intended to boost United 
Western's image and future revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just spending too much money too fast," said United Western Chairman 
Marven Howard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bankers 'Horrified' 
</P>
<P>
Drumwright said banks that lend money to United Western were surprised by the 
size of projected losses and "horrified" when the new management team talked 
about scrapping some projects that Schroeder had touted. "Wayne was pumping 
sunshine and his projections to the banks reflected that optimism," Drumwright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The past management, Drumwright said, too often had fallen short in execution 
of its proposals. For instance, he said, United Western had bought and 
distributed 100 personal computers to staff doctors with the idea of forming a 
computerized information exchange between the doctors' offices and the 
hospitals. But the hospital linkup was never developed. The new management team 
also closed an outpatient diagnostic imaging and surgical center that United 
Western had opened in Irvine -- which Drumwright said was losing $1 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
And the very first day Drumwright and Mack took over, they said, they 
eliminated a controversial newspaper advertising campaign costing $50,000 a 
month that featured testimonials from the hospital's medical staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Employees did not like those ads and were not unhappy to see them gone," said 
Sandy Crawford, the Santa Ana hospital's director of nursing. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to cut costs, the new management team canceled contracts with 
outside companies for services such as accounting, computers, pharmacy and 
engineering, and began performing the services in house. 
</P>
<P>
While some new medical programs have been introduced at United Western 
hospitals in the last 10 months, they are being kept to a minimum, Howard said. 
Instead of installing expensive technology to attract patients, the new 
management says it is trying to stress the basics of good service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Patient Pavilion' Plan 
</P>
<P>
There are plans, for example, to create a "patient pavilion" on the first floor 
of the Santa Ana hospital where all outpatient services will be grouped for 
greater convenience. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to widespread speculation in the Orange County medical community, the 
new management and directors of United Western insist that they have no plans 
to sell any facility or close the Santa Ana hospital's trauma center as part of 
their cost-cutting drive. 
</P>
<P>
Those who operate United Western admit there still are problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim hospital first edged into profitability only in August, in response 
to stringent new cost controls. And Western Medical Center/Bartlett, the 
skilled nursing facility in Santa Ana, continues to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
Also, United Western officials acknowledged that this year the patient census 
at the flagship Santa Ana hospital has slipped, a condition they blame partly 
on the loss of Medi-Cal patients and partly on a countywide decline in hospital 
business reflecting a trend toward more outpatient care. 
</P>
<P>
So far this fiscal year, Drumwright said, United Western is $500,000 to $1 
million in the red. 
</P>
<P>
But there are clear signs of improvement. United Western officials say the 
Santa Ana hospital has returned to profitability and in July and August -- 
traditionally slow business months for hospitals -- and United Western as a 
whole has made a slight profit. 
</P>
<P>
And United Western officials are confident that by staying the current course 
the company will make a profit of $1 million to $2 million by the end of the 
current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"We will concentrate more on nuts and bolts," director Hill said. "We are going 
to mind the store."

INGRAM MICRO D BUYS BELGIAN SOFTWARE FIRM TO GAIN BASE IN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Intent on becoming a big player in the fast-growing European computer market, 
Ingram Micro D has acquired a Belgian software distributor for an undisclosed 
sum. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy said the company's purchase of Brussels-based 
Softeurop will serve as "the critical base in our European expansion strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D, based in Santa Ana, is the leading wholesaler of personal 
computer products in the United States. Softeurop is a leading distributor of 
American-made software products in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Softeurop, to be renamed Ingram Softeurop, will be owned primarily by Ingram 
Micro D. However, the Belgian firm's current management will retain a small 
ownership in the company, said Mark R. Briggs, Ingram's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs said Ingram Micro D, the company formed in April by Nashville-based 
Ingram Industries' acquisition of Micro D of Santa Ana, has had only modest 
sales in Europe up to now. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to become a major player in the European market in the next several 
years," Briggs said. "The European market is growing very fast, and the 
penetration of personal computers (into homes and offices) is less than in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
Briggs described the European market as "very fragmented," with distributors 
concentrating on particular countries and not the continent as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no one handling European distribution in a country-to-country 
way," he said. "We think the reduction of trade barriers in Europe in 1992 
provides untapped potential." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram's Lacy said the company has been evaluating the European marketplace 
"for some time . . . looking for just the right solid, successful company with 
which to join forces." 
</P>
<P>
He said Softeurop made an attractive acquisition because it has "a history of 
success, strong management, an aggressive strategy to expand . . . and an 
organization that executes smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Softeurop, founded in 1983, is the leading distributor of software manufactured 
by Microsoft, Lotus Development and Ashton-Tate in Belgium, Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands. The company also has a subsidiary in France. 
</P>
<P>
"By 1995, we expect Ingram Softeurop to be the major, full-assortment 
distributor of microcomputer products throughout Europe," Lacy said.

REEF BRAZIL GETS FOOT IN SURF-WEAR DOOR; 
</P>
<P>
BROTHERS' LIGHTWEIGHT SANDALS ARE BIG HIT WITH BEACH CROWDS IN U.S. AND 
OVERSEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having lugged surfboards across beaches since he was 11, Fernando Aguerre draws 
on experience when he talks about the value of a good sandal. But Aguerre says 
he could never find a comfortable pair, only ones that were weighty with straps 
that burned the skin. 
</P>
<P>
So, in 1985, he decided to start making his own. 
</P>
<P>
As Aguerre expected, his National City-based company, Reef Brazil, quickly 
developed a loyal following among surfers by providing a sandal that is both 
functional and fashionable. And by introducing his colorful sandals at a time 
when mainstream America was hungry for beachwear, Reef Brazil carved a niche in 
the larger, active outdoor-wear market as well. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the surf-wear craze, Aguerre said it was just a matter of time 
before the general consumer realized that surfers have a keen fashion sense for 
products that are comfortable, colorful and unique. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to put a lid on ourselves," said Aguerre, who is marketing his 
sandals not only to surfers but to fashion-conscious casual dressers as well. 
"We're after the big bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Reef Brazil and other surf and beachwear companies, including Ocean Pacific, 
Gotcha Sportswear and Quiksilver USA, are riding a wave of consumer popularity 
and hanging some big sales numbers. According to industry sources, sales of 
surf wear and accessories are more than $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Since Aguerre and his younger brother, Santiago, launched Reef Brazil, the 
company has definitely been riding a sales crest, growing from 3,000 pairs of 
sandals sold in 1985 to 450,000 pairs sold through the first seven months of 
1989. The company had expected to sell no more than 350,000 pairs for all of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Reef Brazil has built a sales and distribution network that now 
includes more than 1,900 retailers, from small surf shops to giant operations, 
including Nordstrom department stores and L. L. Bean mail-order house. 
</P>
<P>
For 1989, Reef Brazil expects revenues to reach $3.1 million, up from $1.3 
million last year. In 1990, sales should exceed $4 million, the company said. 
Nearly 25% of Reef Brazil's sales are exports to European countries, Canada, 
Japan, New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
As Reef Brazil's first customer, Jeff (J. K.) Kinney, owner of the Surf Club in 
Pacific Beach, has closely observed the company's growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Selling Everywhere' 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say they're blowing away other manufacturers, but they are selling 
everywhere, France, Brazil, you name it. Fernando and Santiago are aggressive 
in their marketing. They're little international trade guys." 
</P>
<P>
But just producing a good product doesn't necessarily mean success for a 
company, especially in the surfing business, according to James (Jimbo) Gaskin, 
associate advertising director for Surfing magazine, one of the sport's leading 
publications. To arouse the interest of surfers, Gaskin says, a company must 
create an image. 
</P>
<P>
"Reef Brazil has created a vibe . . . the word's out that these guys are 
happening," Gaskin said. "Creating a certain image, having mystique. That's 
really important. For example, you can have the best surfer in the world, but, 
if he doesn't come across in photos, he's a dud. Reef Brazil has come up with a 
product that not only is durable and lightweight, but one that looks cool." 
</P>
<P>
Creating the desired sandal, however, didn't happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent two-thirds of our lives surfing in different places of the world, 
talking to surfers, finding out about their needs," said Aguerre, who was born 
and raised in Argentina. What he discovered from these beach chats was that the 
typical rubber sandal could stand some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Material 
</P>
<P>
"The first limitation with rubber is that it's a heavy material," Aguerre said. 
"And the toe strap was so tough that it destroyed your feet. So a lot of 
surfers were wearing slippers to the beach. That's OK when you're going from 
the bed to the bathroom, but it didn't do much for the rest of us who wanted to 
look good." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find quality sandals to stock their surf shop in Argentina -- an 
operation the Aguerre brothers ran before moving to San Diego -- the pair began 
talking with rubber manufacturers in search of an alternative material suitable 
for sandal construction. That's when the Aguerre brothers discovered EVA, a 
foam-like material one-third the weight of rubber. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very easy to change the density of EVA, so you could make it harder for 
the sole of the sandal and soft and cushiony for the insole," Aguerre said. 
"And it's very easy to produce it in different colors." 
</P>
<P>
Working with 15 colors, Reef Brazil combines the shades for more than 45 looks. 
One of its more popular styles is a striped model, with an insole decorated 
with vertical jade and blue stripes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Last' 
</P>
<P>
And to save toes, Aguerre uses polypropylene for Reef Brazil's straps. "It's 
soft as cotton, but tough. It breathes too." Average price for adult Reef 
Brazil sandals is $17.95 
</P>
<P>
Like most fashion trends, however, the current surf-wear rage is almost sure to 
fizzle, which could send many manufacturers for a spill. But Eric Bowie, 
assistant manager of footwear at L. L. Bean, says Reef Brazil has a good chance 
to endure in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure their sales are benefiting from the current boom, but that's not why 
we're carrying them," Bowie said. "We shy away from trendy items. We carry them 
simply because it's a good product. It's a well-built flip-flop that's going to 
last. And it's comfortable." Reef Brazil sandals' soles come with a lifetime 
warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie, who scouts new products for the traditional, outdoor-oriented mail-order 
house in Freeport, Me., added: "Reef Brazil was our best-selling flip-flop this 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Aguerre brothers have no plans to enter the clothing market, Reef 
Brazil will expand its women's and children's sandal line and provide even more 
color combinations. Recently, Reef Brazil also started selling surfboard racks 
and bags. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Marketing 
</P>
<P>
And its marketing campaign continues to be aggressive. Nike may have Bo Jackson 
promoting its products, but Reef Brazil has Derek Ho, three-time Hawaiian 
Triple Crown surfing champion. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping he would promote our product for us," Aguerre said. "When we 
finally met him, he was already wearing our sandals." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Santiago left Argentina and embarked on a "surf-ari," hitting the 
waves off the coasts of Tahiti, the Hawaiian Islands and Southern California. 
Upon arriving in San Diego, Santiago became enchanted with the coastal city and 
decided to become a permanent resident. 
</P>
<P>
After settling down and finding work at a surf shop, Santiago persuaded his 
brother, Fernando, to join him. By late 1984, the Aguerre brothers had 
conceived their plan to market their beach sandal and borrowed more than 
$25,000 from friends and family to launch their American enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In National City, Reef Brazil has 15 employees and 5,700 square feet of office 
and warehouse space. The company contracts with a manufacturer in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil, which employs nearly 150 workers, to produce the sandals. There are 
about 45 sales representatives in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the Aguerre brothers don't worry about losing control of a company that is 
experiencing explosive growth. In fact, they intentionally hold back Reef 
Brazil's growth by selling only to select retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to sell to a Sears or a K mart, we want to protect the surfer's 
mystique," Aguerre said. "We don't want to become a huge company with thousands 
of employees. I don't want to have to wear three-piece suits." Fernando, who 
sports a ponytail, generally wears shorts and, of course, Reef Brazil sandals 
to work.

AUTOMATION LOOMING FOR U.S. MACHINE SHOPS; 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL LAB BREAKS TRAIL BY TEST RUN

<P>
Nearly everything that people touch, all manufactured products, involve the use 
of metal-cutting machine tools. 
</P>
<P>
In countries such as Japan and Sweden and West Germany, the machine-shop owners 
are automating their lathes and drills, saving time and gradually taking over 
the market that once belonged undeniably to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And yet in the United States, less than 11% of the machine tools in many 
metal-fabricating industries are computerized; fewer than half the plants have 
installed automated machines, and, even among plants that have invested in 
computerized automation in the last five years, only about one in six machines 
is computerized. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. machine shops are beginning to automate, and one government research 
lab will be showing small companies how to do so without going into the red. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, 
which is about 30 miles south of Baltimore, will open an automation-technology 
project that it calls the Shop of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help Small Shops 
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to help small metal-working shops gain on foreign 
competitors by automating their operations with inexpensive, off-the-shelf 
computers and software available now at any computer store. 
</P>
<P>
At the national institute, Adrian Moll created the demonstration project by 
modernizing his own 56-employee machine shop, called the Fabrication Technology 
division. There, workers design and build the special instruments and equipment 
used by institute researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, the institute was the Bureau of Standards, where scientists 
built measuring instruments and systems that gave science and industry a basis 
for accurate measurement. In 1988, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act 
changed the federal research lab's name and its focus. 
</P>
<P>
Now, its 3,000 scientists also build better integrated circuits, develop 
tougher industrial ceramics, create improved enzymes and transfer these 
discoveries to U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
At any given time, about 200 companies or organizations are sponsoring 
cooperative research at the institute on such projects as new measurement and 
quality control technology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Calibrations 
</P>
<P>
Its products include thousands of instrument calibrations that often are 
essential for safety and quality control in industrial operations, and its 
standard reference materials are used nationwide to ensure the accuracy of 
clinical lab tests. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, Moll and his division staff installed and taught each 
other to use a personal computer network that allows them to automate routine 
machine-shop activities such as estimating costs, planning manufacturing 
processes, managing the tool room, tracking jobs and costs, and designing and 
manufacturing products. 
</P>
<P>
Automating his own shop, Moll says he "ran the project the same way a small 
machine shop would. We didn't buy anything until we needed it. All the 
equipment was bought piecemeal, then installed when we had time." Still, he 
kept the shop up and running, and profitable, during the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
A shop owner's average cost to put a similar system to work, Moll says, would 
range from $5,000 to $20,000, depending on how much of the software a company 
decided to buy. "Shopping around helps," he adds. The yearlong project cost 
$300,000, including the cost of visiting manufacturing technology centers 
around the United States to talk about the project.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: 'SACRED SOUNDS' TO ACCOMPANY 'HARMONIA' AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While Catholic, Jewish, Hindu and Muslim mystics -- including Tenzin Gyatso, 
the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet -- are gathering with scientists next week in 
Newport Beach for a spiritual conference called "Harmonia Mundi," a companion 
evening series has been planned to focus on inspirational music and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
"Sacred Voices, Sacred Sounds" will explore "how music is utilized to transform 
consciousness and awareness," says Ronald Wong Jue, founder and president of 
the East-West Foundation, which is sponsoring the six-day conference that opens 
Monday at the Marriott and Le Meridien hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"Music really elevates people's awareness of spiritual values," Jue said in a 
recent interview. "If you want to get in touch with the spiritual, I'd rather 
hear Bach than just read about (the subject)." 
</P>
<P>
The evening events are a separate series from the "Harmonia Mundi" daytime 
conference. There is an admission charge, but the public does not have to 
register for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Among the artists participating in the evening series, at UC Irvine's Bren 
Center, are sarod master Ali Akbar Khan, the David Hykes Harmonic Choir, the 
Dimitri Pokrovsky Ensemble from the Soviet Union, and the Tsukusuma Noh Troupe 
from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Poets Robert Bly and Alan Ginsberg also will give readings, but not of their 
own poetry. Jue said that they will read "literature of various sacred 
traditions." 
</P>
<P>
According to Jue, the arts became a very important component in planning of the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted very much to communicate some of the concepts in a different, 
non-cognitive way -- ideas such as peace, harmony and compassion. Some of these 
religious ideas are difficult to communicate on a cognitive level. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is a wonderful metaphor of harmony, for instance. People playing diverse 
instruments get together and play together. That's how the music series began: 
Let's look at music as a metaphor for harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"But since we were also trying to go back to the various mythical traditions of 
the various religions, we felt that in order to communicate the essence of some 
of the teachings, we needed to look at music. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at all spiritual traditions, you will find that music and sound 
have been tremendously important. Not only do many religions have an oral 
tradition, but many times they communicate the spiritual through music and 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
Some groups were picked, according to Jue, because they "blended East and 
West." 
</P>
<P>
The Hykes Harmonic Choir combines Tibetan overtone chanting and medieval 
Western melodic material. The Pokrovsky Ensemble blends Russian folk song and 
liturgical traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Other participants were chosen because of a particularly illuminating aspect of 
the art form. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things in Japanese music is the use of pauses and different 
instruments to symbolize different states of mind," he said. "That gives an 
idea of how to communicate a certain concept through music." 
</P>
<P>
Jue is sensitive that some people would describe all this as "touchy-feely" pop 
psychology. He recoils from the term "new age." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know what (new age) means," Jue said. "We have never thought of 
doing it along that genre. If you look at the (daytime) program, you'll see 
that we really wanted to look at people who have contributed to the field, who 
have some history, who really have written and presented those ideas for a long 
time. We were not developing a fad presentation."

BAIL SET AT $1 MILLION FOR SUSPECT IN RAPE OF GIRL,12; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIENT SET FREE IN EARLIER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bail was set at $1 million today for an unemployed construction worker arrested 
on suspicion of raping a 12-year-old girl abducted from her home in an 
exclusive gated community in Huntington Beach on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Joseph Borges -- a transient who had worked recently at the exclusive 
community -- was arrested at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday after voluntarily going to 
Huntington Beach police headquarters for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Borges, 29, was acquitted in April of prior rape charges in Orange County 
Superior Court involving a 46-year-old Anaheim Hills woman who was attacked in 
her home by a man wearing a ski mask. A DNA fingerprint strongly linked him to 
that crime, but was not admitted as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very persuasive and very strong evidence," said Deputy District Atty. 
Dennis Bauer, who assisted in the prosecution. "It would have prevented this 
kidnap and rape because he'd still be in custody." 
</P>
<P>
Bauer said the testing determined that there was a one-in-36-million chance of 
a person besides Borges matching the chemical genetic characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Employ DNA Testing 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Police said today they may conduct DNA testing in the case of 
the girl who was carried from a living-room sofa bed Sunday by a man who 
covered her mouth with his hand as her frightened friend slid under the covers 
and pretended to sleep. DNA testing has yet to be permitted in Orange County 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the judge said: 'You got the (DNA test) results too late and it's 
not fair to the defendant to put in the evidence at this late date. Besides you 
have other evidence,' " Bauer recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Borges will be arraigned Thursday on kidnaping, rape and burglary charges in 
West Orange County Municipal Court, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears as though we have a strong suspect," Huntington Beach Police Capt. 
Bruce Young said at a press conference today. "There is no reason to believe 
right now that others were involved." 
</P>
<P>
Detectives received more than 100 telephone calls from people with information 
on a composite drawing of the rape suspect released Tuesday morning. Four or 
five of the calls provided information that directly related to Borges, Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The calls and information provided by the victim helped police trace Borges to 
a friend's north Huntington Beach residence. 
</P>
<P>
The girl had been raped, then pushed nude from her abductor's truck at Smokey's 
Stables in county territory south of Warner Avenue and Bolsa Chica Street, 
about a mile from her home. 
</P>
<P>
Young said police believe the kidnaping and rape occurred in the course of a 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel it's a crime of opportunity," he said. "I feel the girl's 
presence was that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Borges is being held in the Huntington Beach city jail on suspicion of kidnap, 
rape and burglary. 
</P>

Queen Elizabeth II today approved a historic honorary award to outspoken 
anti-apartheid campaigner Helen Suzman, the longest-serving member of the South 
African Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
It is considered unusual for the traditional title of honorary Dame Commander 
of the Order of the British Empire to be given to a foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
An official statement said: "For more than 40 years . . . (Suzman's) record of 
persistent opposition to discriminatory legislation has earned international 
respect." Britain will also fund a new scholarship program for black South 
Africans entitled the "Helen Suzman Awards" in further recognition of her work.

ASSAILED BY PROSECUTOR, GABOR FLEES 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor stomped out of her Beverly Hills cop-slapping trial in tears 
today as a prosecutor told jurors that the flamboyant actress viewed the 
courtroom as a stage where "she came to entertain you." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox used a 70-minute closing argument to both shore up 
his misdemeanor criminal case against Gabor and attack her for what he called 
disruptive and attention-grabbing actions during 13 days of trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that outrages me most is she used and abused two weeks of this 
process for her own aggrandizement," Fox said. "The defendant doesn't know the 
meaning of truth. . . . Her perception of truth differs from facts in the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Fox said jurors had a unique opportunity to see Gabor "in an arena that doesn't 
have scripts or cue cards." 
</P>
<P>
"She came to entertain you. . . . She craves the media attention in this case, 
it is clear," Fox said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor then broke down in tears and fled the courtroom, her fourth such exit 
from the trial, which has cost taxpayers nearly $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get out of here. I want to go to Europe," the tearful Gabor said in 
the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Her exit came five minutes into Fox's final argument, and the prosecutor 
continued his address to jurors. 
</P>
<P>
"The world revolves around Miss Gabor (in her mind). What she doesn't like she 
denies. . . . The truth is what's convenient for the defendant. . . . I think 
her true persona has emerged in the course of this trial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant in this case insults you," he added. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, Gabor arrived at court 15 minutes early and told reporters she 
was "dressed for jail" in a black pantsuit outfit. 
</P>
<P>
She also showed off her "horse's behind" cuff links she plans on presenting in 
coming weeks to a TV news commentator who railed against her. 
</P>
<P>
"The policeman, he has a temper, but so do I," the fiery Hungarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Police Officer Paul Kramer pulled Gabor over after noticing 
expired registration tags on her Rolls-Royce Corniche. As he checked for other 
violations, she drove off. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor slapped him when he pulled her over a second time. He said the attack was 
unprovoked, but she said she reacted in self-defense when he forcibly removed 
her from her car.

SONY TO BUY COLUMBIA, SAYS AMERICANS WILL RUN STUDIO; 
</P>
<P>
1ST SALE OF FILM MAKER TO JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The board of Columbia Pictures Entertainment voted early today to sell the 
movie and TV studio to Sony Corp. for $3.4 billion in cash, the first sale of a 
major Hollywood studio to a Japanese concern. 
</P>
<P>
Sony immediately pledged that it will place the company in the hands of its 
U.S. subsidiary "and keep it as independent as possible, as a full-fledged 
member of the U.S. film industry." Sony is rumored to be considered installing 
producer Peter Guber, the 47-year co-chief executive of Guber-Peters 
Entertainment, as chief executive of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's two top executives, President and Chief Executive Victor R. Kaufman 
and Chief Operating Officer Lewis Korman, will leave the company after the 
sale, Columbia said. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Pictures Entertainment includes the Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star 
studios, television programming and syndication operations, a huge film and TV 
library, and the 820-screen Loews movie theater chain. The 2,500-employee 
company has secretly talked with Sony intermittently for more than a year, and 
it announced Monday that negotiations were under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola Gives Option 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola Co., Columbia's largest shareholder with a 49% stake, has given Sony 
an option to purchase those shares, Sony said. Coca-Cola's management has 
pledged that it will recommend the sale of Coca-Cola shares to its board at a 
meeting scheduled Oct. 2. The New York investment banking firm Allen &amp; Co., 
which holds a 3% stake, has given Sony an option to buy its shares as well. 
</P>
<P>
Sony will begin a tender offer for Columbia shares Oct. 2. The offer will run 
for 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is part of a consolidation of the film industry that has come as 
increasing worldwide viewing of entertainment has driven up the studios' 
values. Already this year, the Warner Bros. studio has been sold to Time Inc. 
with its parent, Warner Communications, and MGM/UA Communications has agreed to 
be sold to Qintex Group of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Sony was willing to pay a lofty $27 a share for a company with meager earnings 
because of the strategic value of Columbia's film and TV "software" to a 
company with a strong hold on the emerging TV and audio technologies, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the studio "extends Sony's long-term strategy of building a 
total entertainment business around the synergy of audio and video hardware and 
software," said Michael Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said the high price makes it unlikely -- though not impossible 
-- that another bid will appear. 
</P>
<P>
Sony had no immediate word on whether it foresees layoffs at Columbia, but some 
analysts said they do not expect major changes immediately. Traditional 
Japanese concern about maintaining employment "suggests it's unlikely they 
would come in and make dramatic changes," said Christopher Dixon, an 
entertainment industry analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. 
Also, "Sony is perplexed at some of the realities of the Hollywood community . 
. . so they would probably be unwilling to go in and rattle the cage." he said.

CBS'S AFGHAN WAR FOOTAGE CALLED A FAKE

<P>
The "CBS Evening News" broadcast fake combat footage and false news reports of 
the war in Afghanistan during the mid-1980s, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the footage was shot by cameraman Mike Hoover, who allegedly staged 
scenes of guerrilla sabotage and made a Chinese-built Pakistani jet on a 
training run appear to be a Soviet plane bombing Afghan villages, according to 
the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
CBS was seriously concerned over the charges but was not sure how to 
investigate, the newspaper quoted CBS sources as saying. "It's hard to question 
Afghan rebels," one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
During award-winning news broadcasts on Nov. 12 and 13, 1984, anchorman Dan 
Rather said Hoover had been on hand for "the largest sabotage operation of the 
war." Videotape shot by Hoover showed Moujahedeen rebels purportedly blowing up 
pylons to cut power to Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
The actual sabotage, however, took place 12 days before Hoover arrived on the 
scene, the newspaper said. Etabari, an Afghan serving as the cameraman's 
translator, told the newspaper that Hoover persuaded guerrilla leaders to order 
about a dozen rebels to return to the site so he could stage the sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
"He told the Moujahedeen to destroy pylons that were already destroyed. It was 
completely wrong. It was just for the movie," Etabari was quoted as saying.

<P>
The Pentagon today released a toned-down assessment of Soviet military power, 
declaring that the Soviet threat to the United States is much changed from a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in releasing his department's eighth annual 
report on "Soviet Military Power" -- conceived by former Defense Secretary 
Caspar W. Weinberger as a means of justifying a massive U.S. build-up -- said 
the United States was "clearly encouraged" by changes in the Soviet Union 
"toward a more benign defense posture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister's Visit 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Cheney announced that Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov 
will visit the United States next week in another sign of warming relations 
between the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said Yazov will visit Washington and probably other areas of 
the United States Sunday through Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney told a news conference that the Soviet Union is still a major military 
power. But he wished Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev well in his push for 
civil and defense reforms and said "military-to-military exchanges are a very 
useful thing." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney released the 159-page 1989 version of the slick color book whose title 
this year was altered to: "Soviet Military Power -- Prospects for Change." It 
was minus much of the tough rhetoric of past issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet military capabilities continue to constitute a major threat to our 
security," Cheney said in the preface of the book. But he conceded that there 
were "dramatic changes occurring in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
On this year's cover is a photograph of Soviet troops in armored personnel 
carriers withdrawing from Afghanistan in February. Last year's cover was a 
picture of Gorbachev on the deck of a Soviet nuclear missile submarine. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney repeated U.S. charges that Moscow is modernizing its strategic nuclear 
forces, has already deployed mobile intercontinental missiles and has not yet 
carried out Gorbachev's promises of deep cuts in conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
And he warned against congressional cuts in U.S. defense based on "a kinder, 
gentler Soviet Union."

BUSH URGES IMF, WORLD BANK TO DO MORE TO SPEED POLAND'S RECOVERY

President Bush told the 152-nation International Monetary Fund today "we must 
do more" to help the new non-Communist government of Poland, citing "our 
self-evident stake in its success." 
</P>
<P>
The President urged the international lending organization, and its sister 
agency the World Bank, "to work rapidly with Poland" to help the nation 
restructure its economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is supporting a $119-million package of U.S. economic 
aid to Poland and another $100 million in food aid with nothing more promised. 
Congressional critics are calling for more. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told a group of reporters in the Oval Office after his speech that it is 
still too early to tell how much additional aid the United States might be 
willing to give to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the key thing now is that the Poles themselves are working on a reform 
package," Bush said. "We want to work with them in every way we can, but I 
think it's important to see what their plan is for economic reform." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about an appeal by Poland today for a $1-billion loan from industrial 
nations, Bush said the 12-member European Community "is working on their side; 
we've been helpful on ours. So we'll see what final figures are arrived at." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do everything we can. We are committed to the success for democracy in 
Poland," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On other matters, Bush said in his session with the reporters that there is "a 
good likelihood" he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be able to 
sign a landmark treaty to slash the deadliest weapons in the superpowers' 
nuclear arsenals at a summit meeting next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the scheduling of a summit in late spring or early summer "will 
serve as a catalyst for moving forward on a treaty" and that it may be ready by 
the summit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not absolutely certain that that's going to happen but I would have to 
agree (there is) a good likelihood that might happen," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's statement put him in sync with an optimistic forecast by Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who told the United Nations on Tuesday there 
are "realistic prospects" by the time of the summit for passing "the last turn" 
on the road to a strategic arms reduction treaty (START) to trim 30% to 50% 
from each nation's arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and 
submarines. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to set it up so that if we don't have every 't' crossed and 'i' 
dotted (on a treaty) that the summit . . . is considered a failure," Bush said. 
But he said he agrees with Shevardnadze's statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush held the news conference before flying to Charlottesville, Va., for a 
meeting with the nation's governors to improve the country's education system. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was looking forward to a "candid and very free-flowing discussion" 
at the two-day meeting at the University of Virginia. Bush predicted the 
sessions would result in "strong consensus" for national educational goals, as 
well as in greater flexibility in the way states can use federal education aid. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush said, "There's a strong recognition among the governors that we 
need accountability for achieving results relating to the goals."

Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell accused President Bush today of being 
"overly timid" and urged him to suspend trade restrictions with the Soviet 
Union as a reward for permitting freer emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell (D-Me.) called for the temporary waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment 
which links non-discriminatory trade treatment by the United States with the 
freedom of Soviet citizens to leave their country at will. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic leader noted that more than 100,000 people have been permitted 
to leave the Soviet Union since the beginning of the year and that as many as 
50,000 more have received permission to depart. 
</P>
<P>
"This indisputable rise in Soviet emigration is a step that deserves an 
American response," Mitchell told the Senate.

<P>
Entertainer Wayne Newton, who gave up $500,000 in performance fees while trying 
to resolve a summer-long strike by musicians, returned to the stage Tuesday 
night while pickets marched outside. 
</P>
<P>
Newton performed for a cheering sellout crowd of 1,700 at the Las Vegas Hilton 
where he earns $250,000 a week. The return by the city's leading attraction was 
seen as a major break in a strike by musicians against five Las Vegas resorts. 
</P>
<P>
The return of Newton was seen as a signal that other musicians who have honored 
the picket lines over the last four months might also return to the city's 
showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The popular singer had been instrumental in setting up several meetings with 
resort owners and union leaders while he refused to cross the lines during the 
last two weeks. But he returned to the stage hours after a union leader called 
a "final offer" by hotel management "a piece of garbage."

Leading central banks intervened to sell dollars for the third consecutive day 
today in a concerted drive to push the U.S. currency lower. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar responded by dipping to 1.8815 West German marks and 140.55 Japanese 
yen, and currency dealers said speculation over interest rate rises soon in 
West Germany and Japan was helping the central banks in their campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The central banks "smashed the market successfully," said Walter Simon, a 
trader for Bank Julius Baer in New York. "The central banks want to regain 
respect. . . . It seems to be working," he said.

OPEC OKS OUTPUT PACT; LITTLE PRICE IMPACT SEEN

<P>
OPEC ministers ended five days of talks today with a new output agreement, but 
the pact appeared flawed and did not look as if it would do much to push up 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Algeria dissented and called it illegal. Kuwait voiced reservations, as it did 
with a previous agreement made in June and which it has openly flouted. 
</P>
<P>
The new accord by a majority of the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries failed to reallocate quotas and meet demands to sell more 
oil by Kuwait and the other big quota violator, the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
It simply lifted the ceiling on OPEC supply by 1 million barrels daily to 20.5 
million -- at least a million less than actual volume now -- and raised 
individual countries' quotas on a pro rata basis. 
</P>
<P>
The oil markets saw little good news in the pact. West Texas Intermediate, the 
benchmark U.S. crude, fell 28 cents to $19.25 a barrel for the November 
contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, although by noon it recovered to 
$19.38. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for North Sea Brent crude, a world bellwether, dropped 30 cents to 35 
cents from the day's highs to about $17.55 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Kuwait and the UAE will continue breaking the rules, OPEC 
Secretary General Subroto of Indonesia told a news conference: "I do not know." 
</P>
<P>
Some delegates said OPEC had virtually despaired of getting the UAE back in the 
present quota system. Two of its component emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, 
compete to produce more oil. 
</P>
<P>
Algeria's chief delegate said the decision to raise the OPEC ceiling was not 
unanimous and was therefore illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 ministers had been stymied for five days trying to reallocate quotas in 
a way that would give Kuwait and the UAE the bigger volumes that they demand. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with other members unwilling to surrender market share to achieve 
that, they opted to postpone the attempt to revamp the whole leaky quota system 
until further talks set for Nov. 25 in Vienna and to make do with a stopgap 
accord.

Stock prices were widely mixed today in an on-again-off-again session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.12 to 2,673.06. 
</P>
<P>
But declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 3 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 622 up, 811 down and 518 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 158.40 million shares, against 158.35 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained .34 to 191.81. 
</P>
<P>
The market had to contend with some renewed weakness in the dollar and an 
accompanying rise in credit market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of long-term government bonds declined slightly, increasing their yields 
to the 8.25%-8.30% range. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks also were weighed down by International Business Machines Corp.'s 
disclosure that it expects earnings for the third quarter to be well below what 
analysts have estimated. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers said buyers were encouraged by takeover news and rumors, notably in 
the entertainment industry, that seemed to ease recent fears that Wall Street's 
boom in buyouts and mergers might be nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell slightly in early trading today, showing little reaction to a 
further slide in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/16 point, or 63 cents per $1,000 
face amount by midday, and its yield, which rises when prices fall, climbed to 
8.24% from 8.23% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's fresh decline made traders skittish, but prices nevertheless held 
fairly firm in morning trading, said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at 
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell sharply Monday after central banks of the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations flooded the market with dollars from their reserves. The 
dollar roughly stabilized Tuesday but resumed its fall today under the pressure 
of continued central bank selling. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term, medium-term 
and long-term governments all fell about 1/16 point, according to the Telerate 
Inc. financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
fell 0.72 to 1,170.37.

Approval of a $60-million federal grant today paved the way for construction of 
the nation's first major new airport since 1974, to be built on a 
53-square-mile tract in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner and Federal Aviation Administration 
chief James Busey announced the grant after a signing ceremony attended by 
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, Denver Mayor Federico Pena and members of Colorado's 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Busey said the new international airport, estimated to cost as much as $2.5 
billion, will have "enormous implications for aviation nationally" and should 
reduce air travel delays nationwide by 4%, saving $500 million by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant event in view of the fact that no new major airport has 
been built in the United States since the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport opened in 
1974," Skinner said. "This clearly is a breakthrough in one of the cities where 
we most need a new airport."

Officials responsible for the staging of the 1992 Summer Olympics must make 
"drastic and urgent" decisions to ensure that Barcelona is in shape to host the 
Games, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said today.

What is needed are drastic and urgent decisions."

Samaranch, a Barcelona native recently reelected to head the International

insufficient hotels and monumental traffic jams in Spain's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch is known to favor strengthening the Barcelona Olympic Organizing 
Committee (COOB) through greater state participation. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Spanish television talk show, he said he was concerned that poorly 
run Olympic Games could cause "long-term damage to Spain's international 
image." 
</P>
<P>
He said although he is a Barcelona native and a good Catalan, the Olympics 
"will have ramifications for all Spaniards" and rejected attempts by regional 
or city officials to monopolize the games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Involvement Planned 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said Gonzalez told him today the central government will get more 
involved with the organization of the Games early next year following the Oct. 
29 general elections, in which the ruling Socialists are expected to retain 
their parliamentary majority. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC head has called for the establishment of a sports ministry in Spain. 
Sports currently are handled by an under-secretary in the Ministry of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
The setting of the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, capital of the highly developed 
and independent-minded autonomous region of Catalonia, has become a political 
hot potato. The city and central government are run by Socialists while the 
region as a whole is governed by the conservative nationalist Convergence and 
Union Party.

Jockey Chris Antley, suspended by Belmont Park stewards, admits that he has a 
"substance abuse" problem and has voluntarily surrendered his license, the New 
York State Racing and Wagering Board said today. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released through the board, Antley also said he will not race in 
any other state until the board "acts on my application, if any, for 
relicensing or reinstatement in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Belmont stewards took Antley off his scheduled mounts last Saturday and 
suspended him indefinitely for undisclosed reasons. At the same time, Antley's 
agent, Drew Mollica, said he had severed all ties with the jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Antley, 23, has a long history of drug abuse. He failed a Breathalyzer test for 
alcohol in 1986 and tested positive for marijuana in 1987. Last November, 
Antley tested positive for cocaine and underwent rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The board said that Antley has sought professional help again and that it will 
monitor his progress.
