Raymond Chandler's "Farewell My Lovely," set in the free-wheeling era of the 
1930s when gambling ships were anchored off Santa Monica, refers to that town 
as Bay City. "The name's like a song," detective Philip Marlowe cracks. "A song 
in a dirty bathtub." 
</P>
<P>
In more recent years, critics of the town's liberal government nicknamed it the 
People's Republic of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes a complimentary appellation from Sunset magazine. Taking note of the 
Republic's growing number of galleries and public sculptures, Sunset has 
rechristened it Art City in its September issue.

Fine, we'll go along with that. We get a thrill just driving under "The Big 
Wave," the zig-zag span across Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But the article also cites Jonathan Borofsky's "Ballerina Clown," a 30-foot 
bearded character in a tutu on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the clown's at an entrance to a restaurant in Venice. Where else 
would you expect to find a bearded clown in a tutu?

Councilwoman Joy Picus opened up the birthday present that her son mailed from 
Houston and found a subscription to . . . Garbage. 
</P>
<P>
It's a magazine that bills itself as "The Practical Journal for the 
Environment." 
</P>
<P>
"My son's a real environmentalist," Picus explained. 
</P>
<P>
She added: "And I'm not an easy person to buy a gift for." 
</P>
<P>
It was not the usual catch for L.A. County Animal Control. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to ask our people what it was," said spokeswoman Kay Michaelson. "It 
looked like a mini-anteater." 
</P>
<P>
The creature brought in by officers turned out to be a coati-mundi, a 
ring-tailed, long-nosed critter that lives in South and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently it had been given to a resident in East L.A. as a gift," Michaelson 
said. "Some of his neighbors were concerned. Actually, it was very tame. It 
even had a little collar with a bell. But the owner needed a special permit so 
he just gave it to us." 
</P>
<P>
The coati-mundi was turned over to a wild-animal facility Wednesday. It was 
that or turn it over to UC Irvine as a mascot for its athletic teams, the 
Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who has asked the Coliseum Commission to ban the 
sale of beer at Raiders games, told KABC's Michael Jackson that the stands have 
become so rowdy that "a lot of people bring binoculars to the games -- not so 
they can see the game better, but so they can see the fights better."

Insurance broker Edward Inouye recalls that in the late 1930s his father had a 
different method. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in Rosemead, which was a rural community," said Inouye. "It was 
impossible to get phone service out there. 
</P>
<P>
"My father worked downtown (in L.A.) -- he taught in a Japanese language 
school. He had trained about 48 pigeons, and he'd take one with him. If he was 
going to have to work late, he'd go out to the corner of 1st and San Pedro 
streets and turn the pigeon free to fly home to my mother." 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the air-mail carriers failed to deliver, Inouye said. "And, believe 
it not, he showed up at our house six months later," he added. "He probably had 
a little romance in between."

REASONS FOR S&amp;L CRISIS

<TEXT>
<P>
If we lived in a true democracy, here is how the bill for the savings and loan 
mess might be distributed. Those in Washington who made it possible through 
legislation and those who owned/managed the S&amp;Ls that failed, would be 
stripped of all they own to pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Then those who had $100,000 or more on deposit would be taxed a certain 
percentage, going on down to lesser taxes for those who had only a few thousand 
on deposit. And the poor, urban dweller who never even heard of an S&amp;L? His 
tax bill for this would be zero. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, we have something that interferes with such a democratic 
spreading of the bill -- they are called politicians!

TAKING ALL TOO MUCH INITIATIVE; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE? OR BY JUDGES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court's decision to strike down Proposition 73's two-year-old limit 
on campaign contributions and prohibition on the transfer of funds between 
candidates is another telling example of how the ballot initiative, which seems 
to promise government by the people, too often ends up delivering government by 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
To make this observation is not to imply an excessive judicial activism. It is, 
after all, the American habit to presume that all of society's conflicts, 
ambiguities or just plain loose ends someday will be resolved or, at least, 
tied up by a man or woman in a black robe. And there are very few things that 
produce quite so many frayed ends as the runaway California initiative. 
</P>
<P>
When it was added to the state Constitution in 1911, the initiative's 
Progressive sponsors conceived it as a tool of direct democracy to pry state 
government from the ruthless grip of rapacious special interest. Today, 
however, the reformers' instrument of the popular will is more often something 
very different. 
</P>
<P>
First among its defects is the sheer frequency of its use: In November, for 
example, voters will be handed 13 initiatives, another 10 bond measures and 
five constitutional amendments. The ballot pamphlet is expected to run at least 
250 pages. 
</P>
<P>
Where there is that much smoke, the fire of free enterprise is bound to burn 
brightly. In 1988, initiatives generated $130 million in revenue for the 
political consultants and advertising agencies that ran such campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the measures they promote are intricate, highly technical proposals 
whose full implications are hellishly obscure. Proposition 128, the "Big Green" 
initiative on November's ballot, is more than 16,000 words long and touches on 
issues from global warming to pesticides. Any proposal of such complexity is 
bound to result in litigation. For instance, Proposition 103, the insurance 
reform measure passed in the same year as Proposition 73, is still tied up in 
court, as is Proposition 115, the sweeping alteration of the criminal-justice 
system approved last June. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73 also is representative of another problematic form of 
proposition, the counter-initiative. It was put on the ballot to frustrate the 
intentions of a legitimate reform measure, Proposition 68, which also passed 
but did not take effect because 73 -- so obviously unconstitutionally 
restrictive of free speech -- received more votes. 
</P>
<P>
Similar countermeasures have been placed on the upcoming ballot by the liquor 
and timber interests. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 115 -- like Big Green and Propositions 129 and 131 on the ballot -- 
represents still a third variation, measures proposed as adjuncts to 
candidates' campaigns, in this case the gubernatorial efforts of Pete Wilson 
and John K. Van de Kamp, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Coming as it does a little more than a month before an election, the judicial 
decision to invalidate Proposition 73 is bound to create confusion and 
uncertainty. But the fault is neither in our stars nor on our bench, but in our 
delusion that California can be governed by "direct" initiative rather than 
"messy" electoral politics.

USING ABORTED TISSUE IN RESEARCH

Corbett's column portrays big medicine as a caring industry that, if unchained 
from the grips of right-wing ideology, would save us from many diseases. She 
also writes of "miracles" by using fetal tissue to lengthen the lives of 
Parkinson's disease sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
All this would be wonderful stuff if we were a species who lived in harmony 
with the others that inhabit the planet. But the facts are that humans have 
dominated, raped and plundered just about everything we have touched or could 
see. 
</P>
<P>
Any attempts to extend our lives consist of nothing more than humankind's 
egotistical quest for immortality and big medicine, i.e., big business, 
capitalizing on that, sensing money to be made. I urge everyone facing the 
potential of a degenerative fatal disease to make his peace with his God, his 
loved ones and himself, and leave life in a dignified and as untechnical a way 
as he came into the world. That in my eyes would truly be a miracle.

BULGING PORTFOLIO

The prospect that MCA Inc., a giant U.S. entertainment company, might someday 
have Japanese owners is troubling not only because it looks to some people as 
if yet another slice of Americana -- along with Rockefeller Center, Columbia 
Pictures and soon, Pebble Beach -- might be added to Japan's portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The real worry about Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s move is that it 
illustrates a major weakness in U.S. business: We have given up too much of our 
manufacturing capability. 
</P>
<P>
By virtually abandoning the production of consumer electronics, no U.S. company 
is in a position to compete with the strategy reflected in Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co.'s interest in MCA. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese firm, one of the world's largest consumer electronics companies, 
is holding talks with MCA, whose vast film and TV library includes "Field of 
Dreams," "Jaws," "E.T." and "Murder, She Wrote." The programming would give 
Matsushita something to show on its new generation of high definition TVs, thus 
enabling the company to own a whole entertainment package -- "hardware" as well 
as "software." Sony had the same idea when it bought Columbia Pictures last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic how the Japanese have stolen a page from America's book. Way back 
when, U.S. electronics pioneer RCA developed radio and then founded National 
Broadcasting Co. network. Today, Zenith Electronics is the only American 
company manufacturing TVs. It is pursuing high definition TV, too, but lacks 
programming resources. It's an increasingly familiar story.

SLAMMING THE DOOR ON HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
THE URGENCY OF KEEPING THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT IN THE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress may be in a cost-cutting mood, but some programs in the federal budget 
are not expendable. Low-income housing tax credits, the primary government 
resource for financing new affordable housing, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
The credits provide a strong incentive for private corporations to invest 
locally. In exchange for financing the acquisition, rehabilitation or 
construction of low-income housing, investors receive a credit deducted from 
their federal income tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
That tax break encourages the business community to want to build housing for 
poor people. It also encourages solid public-private partnerships, a vital 
social contract as government revenues become more limited. 
</P>
<P>
The tax credits cost the federal government $300 million a year, but they also 
generate the investment used to produce 100,000 apartments, townhouses and 
single rooms designed for senior citizens, the poor or persons just down on 
their luck. These tenants pay rents that by law cannot exceed 30% of their 
incomes; that makes rents affordable even in expensive housing markets. 
</P>
<P>
The tax credits are quite popular politically. Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is a 
big booster. More than 75 members of the Senate and more than 200 members of 
the House also favor renewal. Mayors also endorse the credit because it funnels 
significant investment to local housing needs. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley is 
encouraging California businesses to invest $125 million in low-income housing 
over the next five years. That investment would pay for the construction of 
4,000 rental units and provide subsidies to keep the rents within the reach of 
very poor families. 
</P>
<P>
Given such bipartisan support, extension should be a done deal. But the 
enormity of the nation's fiscal and political dilemmas requires Congress to put 
just about everything on the table. Even so, millions of Americans need 
affordable dwellings. It would be a crime if Congress failed to extend the 
low-income housing tax credit.

WHY THEN EMBRACE DE KLERK?; 
</P>
<P>
IN MANY WAYS, SOUTH AFRICA HAS BEEN WORSE THAN IRAQ. BUT HOW DIFFERENTLY THE 
ADMINISTRATION TREATS THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson writes a syndicated column from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the value of oil increases, the value of blood may be devalued. Why else 
would the Bush Administration refuse to talk with Saddam Hussein with American 
lives at risk, and insist on talking with South Africa's President F. W. de 
Klerk while apartheid continues to reap its grisly harvest of African lives? 
</P>
<P>
Why embrace De Klerk? Apartheid's racial repression of the majority for decades 
has taken a far greater toll than Hussein's attacks on the Kurdish minority in 
Iraq. De Klerk's presidency is no more democratic -- and certainly far less 
representative -- than Hussein's dictatorship. South Africa's terror against 
its several neighbors is no less aggression than Iraq's aggression against 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush announced that reforms in South Africa were "irreversible." But 
why give out the grade before the exam has been taken? Nelson Mandela is out of 
jail, but he is not free. The pillars of apartheid still stand -- the laws that 
exclude blacks from voting, those that enforce segregation and racial 
exploitation, those that give the police emergency powers for brutal 
repression. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, President De Klerk's security police are now implicated in the current 
violence among black South Africans. De Klerk has used the rhetoric of one 
person, one vote, but does that have the same meaning in the South African 
context as it does in the United States? Nelson Mandela does not think reform 
is irreversible; he urges sanctions until democracy. Why embrace De Klerk? 
</P>
<P>
For years, conservatives defended South Africa as a strategic ally against 
communism in southern Africa. But the Cold War is over. Romance with the 
apartheid regime, always immoral, now has no strategic excuse. Leaders of the 
African majority call upon us to keep the pressure on until democracy comes. If 
self-determination by the majority is a principle of American foreign policy, 
why then embrace De Klerk? 
</P>
<P>
The world acknowledges that South Africa is a racist state. In 1988, the 
Democrats called it a terrorist state. Both are right. Under the pressure of 
economic sanctions and international isolation, De Klerk decided it was better 
to jaw with Nelson Mandela than to jail him. Greater political participation 
and involvement are happening in the country. Hopes for fundamental change have 
risen. But only the hope, not the reality. 
</P>
<P>
This week, President Bush became thefirst U.S. President to meet with the head 
of a South Africa still organized on the principle of apartheid. If President 
Bush had met with De Klerk to repeat forcefully our concern for a democracy, 
our commitment to sanctions until democracy is reality, the meeting might have 
been understandable. We must learn to talk with those who we oppose. For the 
same reason, the United States should try to talk it out with Hussein, not 
simply fight it out. But we would not praise Hussein while Americans were still 
held hostage and Iraqi troops remained in Kuwait. Why then embrace De Klerk? 
</P>
<P>
Many fear that De Klerk hopes to use cosmetic reform to end South Africa's 
costly international isolation, without ending the brutal racial exploitation 
on which apartheid is built -- a face lift without changing the fundamentals in 
South Africa. The Administration's decision to use a loophole in the sanctions 
law to import South African iron and steel may embolden him. President Bush's 
warm embrace may encourage him. If so, the President's meeting with De Klerk 
was as wrong-headed as the Administration's kinder and gentler dealings with 
Saddam Hussein prior to the invasion of Kuwait. Both conversations sent the 
wrong message to the wrong man at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
When Iraq's aggression threatens the supply of oil, we mobilize the world. Our 
guard seems to go down and our tolerance up when the question is racial 
violence. We cannot value oil more than blood. If we are to build the new world 
order that the President invokes, we must begin by measuring human rights by a 
single yardstick. Support international law, but be consistent. Why then 
embrace De Klerk? 
</P>
<P>
The smiles may beguile. Congress should now make certain that President De 
Klerk is clear about this country's opposition to apartheid. Loopholes in the 
sanctions legislation should be closed, our commitment to sanctions until 
democracy restated. The end of South African economic sanctions and isolation 
should and will come from change within -- not from public relations abroad.

PERSPECTIVES ON TERM LIMITATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
. . . NO, IT'LL SHIFT POWER TO THE UNELECTED; 
</P>
<P>
SURE, VOTERS ARE ANGRY. BUT INTEREST GROUPS WITH THEIR OWN AGENDAS ARE 
FUNNELING THE ANGER TO THEIR OWN BENEFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NELSON W. POLSBY, Nelson W. Polsby is director of the Institute of 
Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. This article expresses his opinion, not 
that of the institute or university. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators 
are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls. 
Students of government like me find it hard to understand why. Contrary to most 
of the propaganda on the subject, these constitutional changes won't do what 
their proponents say they want to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
For example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest 
groups and their money on elections. Quite the contrary. Forcing senior members 
of a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their 
place will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the 
veterans already have. This will require large new infusions of money and 
electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to 
special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain 
and expensive campaign environment. 
</P>
<P>
Term limitations won't improve the functioning of the legislature, either. 
People need time to learn their jobs. Term limitations throw away the benefits 
of learning from experience. Inexperienced legislators are less powerful in 
relation to legislative staff, executive branch bureaucrats and interest-group 
lobbyists from whom they must learn the customs and routines of legislative 
operations and the stories behind policy proposals. 
</P>
<P>
New people in any complex institution are highly dependent on the people around 
them. Term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the 
relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who 
surround them. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we assume that new blood is automatically better than old? Of course we 
should pay attention to the quality of our legislators and vote against those 
whose performance we find wanting. Term limits merely guarantee that the good 
will disappear along with the bad. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, term limitations won't enhance representative democracy. Just the 
opposite, since they create an artificial barrier preventing voters from 
returning to office legislators they might otherwise favor. Why are we so 
certain that voters have such terrible judgment that they need a constitutional 
restriction keeping them from voting for incumbents they know and like? It is 
hard to see how restricting voters' alternatives in this arbitrary way can be 
proposed in the name of representative government or of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
One must conclude that other forces are at work. More likely, groups and 
interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term 
limitations to improve their chances of winning office. They are undoubtedly 
calculating that non-incumbents are easier to beat, or buy. They're probably 
right about that.

A bill to allow consumers to seek up to $2,500 in civil damages for the illegal 
use of their credit report information has been signed into law by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Californians do not want the private information contained in their 
credit report files to be sold to third parties for compiling direct mail or 
telephone lists," said Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa), the author of AB 
2908. 
</P>
<P>
Peace said TRW, Equifax and Transunion, the three main consumer credit 
reporting agencies, have agreed to stop providing such information to 
unauthorized parties upon the request of consumers beginning Jan. 1, when the 
law goes into effect. 
</P>

appropriate $22.2 million in earthquake bond funds to repair state facilities 
in the San Francisco-Oakland area that were damaged by last year's major 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>

Bills Vetoed 
</P>
<P>
Airport Noise: SB 2405 by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) to limit the 
rights of homeowners near airports to file noise damage lawsuits. The governor

100-YEAR TRIBUTE; 
</P>
<P>
PIONEERS: THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN FOR AGRICULTURE WILL HONOR THREE FARM FAMILIES 
FOR THEIR CENTURY OF COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three Ventura County families who have farmed in the area for more than 100 
years will be honored in Saticoy tonight for their contributions to the county. 
</P>
<P>
James Meikle Sharp began farming in Saticoy in 1876. Rudolph E. Haase arrived 
in Bardsdale in 1888. And Battista Vanoni settled in the Conejo Valley in 1889. 
</P>
<P>
Their families are being honored by California Women for Agriculture for their 
contributions both to agriculture and to community life over the past century, 
said Robin Dick, chairwoman of tonight's tribute. 
</P>
<P>
The three families were instrumental in the development of the county's 
agricultural industry, said Alberta Word, former librarian at the Ventura 
County Historical Society Museum and now reference librarian at Foster Library. 
</P>
<P>
"All three were extremely active families who took the lead in projects in 
Ventura County and did what needed to be done to improve agriculture here," 
Word said. 
</P>
<P>
James Sharp, an Ohio-born and educated man who crossed the country by oxcart, 
settled with his wife and son in the county at age 32 as a part-time 
schoolteacher and full-time farmer. 
</P>
<P>
He planted lima beans and walnuts and later added lemons and oranges. Sharp 
soon founded and became the first president of the now defunct Saticoy Walnut 
Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, Grace, became the county's first woman physician in 1899. She 
donated her medical services for about five years until she quit her practice 
"on account of the night work," she wrote in a 1958 book called "Yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Grace, as she was known, and husband John Thille, whom she married at age 
50, donated money to begin construction of Santa Paula Memorial Hospital. They 
also contributed to the Catholic Church and Villanova Preparatory School in the 
Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Thilles moved into the large Victorian Sharp family house on Telegraph Road 
when Grace Sharp Thille's parents died. They had no children of their own but 
raised the four children of a brother who died. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Alderson, whose mother was raised by Dr. Grace, now lives in the 
family house where she spent many holidays and summers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like coming to Grandma's house," she said of her visits to her 
great aunt, who died in 1979 at 103. 
</P>
<P>
Farther east in the county, German immigrant Rudolph Haase helped bring an 
invaluable element to Bardsdale farming: water. He helped form the Southside 
Improvement Co. to bring water from the Santa Clara River to Bardsdale, a rural 
community that still exists just south of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
A thrifty man, Haase built a combination home and barn using leftover wood from 
the flume used to carry the water from the river, grandson Paul Haase said. 
Paul Haase said his grandfather built the house in the old German style with a 
barn for animals on one side, hay storage in the middle and residence for the 
family on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally tore it down in 1955 or 1957," Paul Haase said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1908, after farming had proved profitable for the Haases, Rudolph and wife 
Emelie built a large two-story Victorian house in Bardsdale to accommodate them 
and their six children. 
</P>
<P>
Their grandson, Paul Haase, a farmer who now lives in the house with his own 
family, tells of an extended family of 11 grandchildren of Rudolph and Emelie 
who were raised within a few miles of each other and who remain close today. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandad treated all the grandchildren alike," Paul Haase said. "We were all 
raised with that love and devotion for family." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Haases, Vanoni family members remain active in Ventura County 
agriculture. They follow the tradition set up by grandfather Battista Vanoni, 
who arrived in Pasadena in 1890 looking for work. He took a series of 
short-term jobs as a farmhand and woodchopper until he saved enough money to 
lease 40 acres in El Rio in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
He then sent for wife Mariana and 7-year-old son Attilio, who he had left 
behind in their native Italy. 
</P>
<P>
By 1910, the family bought 100 acres on Walnut Avenue east of Ventura and moved 
an old house and barn onto the property. By 1920, the family had prospered 
enough to build the two-story, six-bedroom house that stands on the property 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Vanoni, who had six children with Marianna and four more children with his 
second wife, is credited with one of the county's first flood control and soil 
conservation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Siro (Bob) Biocca, the only son of Battista Vanoni's daughter, Elizabeth, lived 
in the house with his grandparents as a boy when his mother divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandfather was a very kind man," Biocca said. "He helped people all the time 
-- too many people. Sometimes he got swindled out of his money. But he was very 
honest and very well-liked." 
</P>
<P>
Biocca has lived in the house since 1970 with his wife, Mary. 
</P>
<P>
The Sharp, Haase and Vanoni families follow 25 other pioneer farm families in 
Ventura County honored by the local chapter of the California Women for 
Agriculture, a statewide organization set up for political lobbying and 
community education. 
</P>
<P>
Others honored in previous years by the organization include the families of: 
W.J. Friend, Nathan W. Blanchard, Robert P. Strathern, J. Christian Borchard, 
W.D. Hobson, O.J. Goodenough, Dominick McGrath, Lloyd Butler, George Briggs, 
George Crane, E.A. Duval, William Hughes, John Mahan, Benjamin Warring, Peter 
Donlon, John Cummings, Charles Barnard, Louis Pfelier, John Pinkerton, Juan 
Camarillo, William Shiells, Samuel Edwards, Michael Clark, Frank Jauregui and 
Jacob Maulhardt.

CLAIM FILED OVER POLICE DOG'S BITE; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: THE $100,000 LEGAL ACTION IS THE THIRD ONE AGAINST THE CITY'S K-9 UNIT 
IN THREE YEARS. POLICE SAY THE ANIMALS HELP FIND DRUGS AND LOST CHILDREN. 
</P>

<P>
An incident involving an Oxnard police dog that allegedly escaped from a patrol 
car and bit both a police officer and a crime suspect has led to the filing of 
a $100,000 damage claim against the city -- the third legal battle in as many 
years involving the K-9 unit. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest of three incidents involving Oxnard police dogs since 1987, Aaron 
Person, 21, of Oxnard is seeking $100,000 for physical and emotional damage in 
connection with an alleged dog attack on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
Person's claim against the city, filed Monday by a Van Nuys attorney, charges 
that he was unnecessarily injured when a police dog escaped from a patrol car 
and attacked him as well as a police officer who had wrestled him to the ground 
in an alley near Citrus Grove Lane. 
</P>
<P>
During the attack, according to a police report, the dog bit Officer Scott 
Hebert in the face before biting Person on the right leg. Both men were 
hospitalized for several days, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attacks, Oxnard police officials defend the K-9 unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy with our K-9 unit," said Assistant Police Chief William Cady, 
adding that the four dogs in the department help find lost children and locate 
hidden narcotics and suspects. 
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that the dogs are not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"They are dogs and they do things on instinct even though you train them the 
best you can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They do bite people sometimes," said Lt. Stan Myers, who oversees the K-9 
unit. "It's unfortunate but they do." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "The dogs do an outstanding job." 
</P>
<P>
Person's claim, a legal move required before a lawsuit can be filed against a 
city, follows two other incidents in Oxnard that have led to lawsuits -- one of 
them resolved by an out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city settled a lawsuit filed by Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy 
Kenneth Bailey, who charged that he was bitten on the leg by a police dog named 
Kai while on duty and in pursuit of a burglary suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred in the 1900 block of San Gorgonio Avenue on Aug. 6, 1988, 
according to the claim -- and later a lawsuit -- filed against the city. 
</P>
<P>
James Farley, the attorney who represented Bailey, said the dog was released by 
his handler while Bailey was chasing a burglary suspect. The dog bit Bailey 
because he could not distinguish between the burglar and the deputy, Farley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Farley said he does not recall exactly how much the city paid Bailey. But he 
estimated that it was more than $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city still faces a $100,000 lawsuit in a 1987 incident in which Epifiano 
Cervantes and his brother, Artemio Cervantes, allegedly were bitten by Kai when 
the dog was sent into a house that police believed was being burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police acknowledged in a police report that they later realized they had 
investigated the wrong house. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent incident, Officer Hebert was hospitalized for several days 
and still has visible scars, police said. Hebert declined to comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Person, who was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest, was 
hospitalized with a large bite wound on his inner thigh. Person later pleaded 
no contest to the misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and 
three years of probation, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Andy J. Collins, a Van Nuys attorney representing Person, claimed the Police 
Department was negligent in handling the dog. 
</P>
<P>
"The dog went crazy, and I don't think it was meant to happen that way," he 
said. "The dog came out of nowhere and started biting." 
</P>
<P>
The March 23 incident began when Hebert was on routine patrol near the Carriage 
Theater on Gonzales Street, according to a police report written by Officer 
Kenneth Klopman. 
</P>
<P>
The report says Hebert saw Person leaving the theater and recognized him as 
being on probation stemming from a conviction for being under the influence of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Hebert called out to Person, but Person fled through 
the parking lot. Hebert chased Person on foot and caught him in an alley near a 
condominium complex on Citrus Grove Lane near C Street, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Hebert tried to search and handcuff Person but Person resisted. 
A struggle ensued and both men fell to the ground, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hebert got on top of Person, who was face down on the ground," the report 
said. "Hebert attempted to apply a carotid chokehold on him." 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Officer James O'Brien of the K-9 unit drove up to the alley and, 
witnessing the struggle, got out of his patrol car to help restrain Person, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
While the report does not say how the dog got out of the patrol car, it relates 
that the three men were struggling on the ground when the dog bit Hebert on the 
face. 
</P>
<P>
"Hebert rolled off Person and heard him yelling and O'Brien telling Person to 
'Let go of the dog,' " the report said. "Hebert then realized that he had been 
bitten . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Collins said that under the requirements of Person's probation, police are 
allowed to search him for drugs. Collins said he doesn't dispute the fact that 
Person ran from the officer, but he contended that Person was the victim of 
police negligence in handling the dog. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all rather vague on how he got out," Collins said, referring to the dog. 
"But I don't think the dog was meant to get out." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said he is not sure whether Person's injury has healed completely.

VETO OF COAST PANEL BILLS NO SURPRISE TO OFFICIALS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE GOVERNOR, A LONGTIME CRITIC, CONTENDS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS 
ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT POWERS TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED and MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County officials and environmentalists said Wednesday that they were 
not surprised by Gov. George Deukmejian's veto of bills aimed at giving the 
Coastal Commission more power to crack down on illegal development. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, a longtime critic of the commission, shot down the bills, which 
were introduced by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles). The governor said 
the commission "already has adequate enforcement powers against violators if 
used in a prudent and rational manner." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who is not seeking reelection this year, released the veto messages 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
One bill would have empowered the panel to impose fines and cease-and-desist 
orders directly against violators of the California Coastal Act. The other 
would have required the panel to implement a comprehensive enforcement program, 
in part to ferret out violations of the Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
Without the bills' enforcement powers, the commission must still go through the 
courts to stop illegal coastal development. 
</P>
<P>
And some environmentalists say the 40 miles of Ventura County coastline will 
suffer from continued abuse during the delay in getting court-ordered fines or 
work-stoppage orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Not good," said Roma Armbrust, chairwoman of the Ormond Beach Observers. 
Former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. "established the commission for the 
protection of the coastline, and that protection's being eroded all the time," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say the possibilities for abuses on the coast are probably rampant" 
without the proposed laws, said Russ Baggerly, spokesman for the Environmental 
Coalition of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Baggerly cited Mugu Lagoon near Point Mugu, which he said has been filled with 
silt and algae by runoff from the Hill Canyon waste-water treatment plant. And 
he cited the Halaco aluminum-recycling operation on Perkins Street in Oxnard, 
which he said is leaching waste water and perhaps contaminants into sensitive 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials refused to comment on whether they are prosecuting the 
operators of those sites for any Coastal Act violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying principle for the Coastal Act was to preserve a resource for 
all Californians and not to allow this resource to be purchased and built upon 
for the private use of a few rich individuals," Baggerly said. 
</P>
<P>
But Baggerly, Armbrust and state Sen Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) predicted 
that the measures could have a second life once a new governor takes office in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said Deukmejian has stated his dislike of the Coastal Commission 
frequently and bluntly, and "says he's going to do all he can to undermine and 
destroy" it. 
</P>
<P>
"But with a new governor, whether" it is U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson or former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, "I think there's going to be a significant 
improvement," Hart said. "We'll have to redouble our efforts with a new 
governor, and I think if we work hard at it, something could be in place by the 
second half of next year." 
</P>
<P>
Some said the veto makes no difference. 
</P>
<P>
Madge L. Schaefer, Ventura County Board of Supervisors chairwoman, said, "What 
the governor said was, 'Status quo.' " And whether the stronger enforcement 
powers would have slowed damage to the coastline "is pure speculation," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme Mayor Dorill B. Wright said the commission could be more effective 
if it worked with county or city governments to prosecute violators, or if it 
filed criminal complaints against violators through the attorney general's 
office and sought restitution for damaged coastline from the developers. 
</P>
<P>
In vetoing the bills, Deukmejian repeated objections that he raised last year 
when he vetoed a similar measure sponsored by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita). 
The governor said he appreciates Rosenthal's efforts but that the commission 
should not have the sole authority to stop illegal projects and levy fines. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Liebster, a commission spokesman, said the panel needs expanded 
enforcement authority, citing a backlog of more than 700 cases pending 
statewide. About 100 of those cases are in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis 
Obispo counties, said James Johnson, the commission's area manager. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the current law is written, . . . it doesn't provide adequate 
incentive for property owners to comply," Johnson said Wednesday. "With this 
new authority, the commission had hoped to have a deterrent for property owners 
who build seawalls, grade creeks and wetlands, cut hillside roads, or build 
additions to beachfront homes or businesses without permission. And it's 
unfortunate those were vetoed."

HUNGRY WILDLIFE STRAYING INTO SUBURBS; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: FOUR DRY YEARS HAVE PARCHED NATIVE VEGETATION, FORCING BOBCATS, BEARS, 
MOUNTAIN LIONS, DEER AND COYOTES TO FORAGE CLOSER TO INHABITED AREAS. 
</P>

Hungry bobcats, bears and mountain lions -- unable to find food in Ventura 
County's drought-parched forests -- are being pushed out of their natural 
habitats to scavenge in rural communities, game officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a black bear ripped the door off a trailer home in Rose Valley 
just north of Ojai. And within the past month, there have been several reports 
of mountain lions eating livestock near Los Padres National Forest. Several 
bobcats have been reported near houses in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say that over the past two years they have received twice the 
complaints -- about 20 a month -- of wild animals in populated areas. The 
drought is now in its fourth year in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been having more and more conflicts with animals," said Capt. Roger 
Reese, with the state Department of Fish and Game. "The fact is, it's very dry 
out there, and there just isn't a lot of food and water for them." 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officials say they are advising residents in rural areas to be 
aware of the problem. But so far, no one has been attacked by the wild animals, 
although there have been such attacks reported elsewhere in Southern 
California, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyotes have been running amok, officials said. Virtually all parts of the 
county except beach areas probably have been visited at one time or another by 
coyotes, said Kathy Jenks, director of the Ventura County Department of Animal 
Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, coyotes are often seen in Grant Park above City Hall, and in Arroyo 
Verde Park in the Ondulando district on the east side, Jenks said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, coyotes have been seen on streets in Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and 
Simi Valley. The rural, foothill developments are especially vulnerable, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenks said she advises residents to keep small pets inside, especially at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
There have even been a few cases in which brazen coyotes have attacked family 
animals in back yards, and a large number of house cats are disappearing, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The common house cat is like a fancy feast for a coyote," she said. "They're 
hungry, they're thirsty and they're coming down out of the hills."

<P>
There have been a few reports of deer grazing in people's yards, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, September is the worst month for wildlife, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is usually the driest month," Reese said. "And a lot of animals that have 
been raised in the spring leave their parents and go in search of food." 
</P>
<P>
More animals are expected to leave their natural habitats if the drought 
continues, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people who call that if we didn't have the big cats and the coyotes, we 
would be overrun by rodents," Jenks said. "I would much rather hear a coyote in 
the distance than have roof rats." 
</P>
<P>
Don DeBusschere, who lives on a 45-acre walnut orchard in Happy Valley near 
Ojai, said his family has grown accustomed to wild animals. DeBusschere said he 
has seen scores of coyotes, several deer and a black bear. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he said, two bobcats have moved into the trees on the edge of his 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not out to get humans," DeBusschere said. "They're just trying to make 
a living off the land."

VOTE EXPECTED ON IMPORTING WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura City Manager Jon Baker plans to set the stage for the first vote on 
importing state water since the city's new slow-growth council was voted into 
office last November. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he will place a proposal by Councilman Jim Monahan on next week's 
City Council agenda to import state-owned water from Lake Piru by ferrying it 
down the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
Baker predicted that the state water vote would make next Monday's meeting one 
of the longest, best attended and most hotly debated sessions in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura has paid $7.3 million for its rights to 10,000 acre-feet per year of 
state-owned water since 1964 but has never retrieved its allotment. 
</P>
<P>
One acre-foot of water typically serves the needs of a family of four for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan, a state water proponent who is often the lone dissenter on the 
council, asked Baker to schedule a vote on requesting the state water 
allocation. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Piru is connected to the state water project. 
</P>
<P>
The United Water District, which serves mostly agricultural users in the Ojai 
Valley, started importing its 5,000-acre-feet allocation down the river this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura has until Oct. 1 to apply for its share, but the council decided 
earlier this month to let the deadline pass. Most of the water would percolate 
into underground aquifers before reaching the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan charged that his colleagues were dragging their feet in solving the 
city's water shortage, which led to rationing measures in April. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't get any water unless we stick our hat out in the rain," he said.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: HOUSEBOUND SENIORS FIND NEW FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the 20-year age gap between them, Herman Roller, 87, and Mel Pownall, 
67, never have a lag in their conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we've hit it off good," Roller said, beaming at his new friend. The two 
are part of the Friendly Visitor Program sponsored by Conejo Valley Senior 
Concerns, in which an elderly housebound person is matched with a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, who visit for an hour once a week and call between visits, are 
trained in communication and listening skills. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to understand that there is no right thing to say to the 
seniors," said Marilyn Mathews, senior services adviser. "They just need to 
listen to the seniors talk and be familiar with the aging process." 
</P>
<P>
But Roller and Pownall do more than chat about the weather. Pownall brings a 
putting green to Roller's Newbury Park house for a little practice. 
</P>
<P>
If it isn't golf, then it's a discussion on the life and letters of St. Paul, 
the missionary apostle. Pownall is a minister at the Conejo Valley Church of 
Christ who spent 20 years doing religious work in Italy. While abroad, he 
traveled to areas where the saint began seven Christian churches in AD 47-49. 
</P>
<P>
Roller is a former Bible school teacher who has bought every book available on 
the saint. His interest is so keen that he drew a map of St. Paul's journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Pownall said the two men have fun challenging each other on St. Paul and his 
writings. But Roller said: "There isn't much he doesn't know." 
</P>
<P>
Mathews said Conejo Valley Senior Concerns is searching for volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our volunteers have monthly support meetings where they can come to terms with 
the process of old age, death and dying. They talk about what has worked well 
and what hasn't. The nice thing that we see are that relationships are starting 
to build." GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

BANK ROBBER SUSPECTED IN 3 OTHER THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who robbed a Ventura bank Wednesday is suspected of holding up three 
other Ventura County banks this week, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of A. Levy, 2499 Harbor Blvd., was robbed about 2:30 p.m., according 
to Gary Auer of the FBI's Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI believes that the robber, who ran away with an unknown amount of cash, 
also robbed two Port Hueneme banks last week and one in Oxnard on Monday, Auer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Savings, 2671 N. Ventura Road, and Bank of America, 755 W. Channel 
Islands Blvd., both of Port Hueneme, reported robberies on Sept. 19 and 21, 
respectively, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
First Nationwide Bank, 1055 S. Oxnard Blvd., Oxnard, reported a robbery Monday, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the man presented a note claiming that he had a weapon, although 
he never showed one, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber is described as a Latino man about 5 feet, 10 inches tall with a 
heavy build, short, black hair and a cleft chin, Auer said. On Wednesday, the 
robber was wearing a blue shirt such as those worn by service station workers, 
a blue baseball cap and sunglasses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second string of bank robberies in the county in recent months. In 
August, authorities arrested two men suspected of robbing eight banks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual that they hit more than one," Auer said. "In fact, it's very 
common because virtually all bank robbers are utilizing narcotics. They can't 
stop, so you continue seeing bank robbers doing more than one bank robbery." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the two series of robberies, bank holdups are down this year compared 
to last. Wednesday's robbery was the 29th since January, Auer said. Last year 
at this time 56 banks had been robbed. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

STATE OPTOMETRISTS OFFER FREE VISION EXAMS FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Occasionally, a patient will put on his or her first pair of eyeglasses and 
say, "Wow, there's leaves on top of the trees," said Dr. Thomas Holden, an 
Oxnard optometrist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how not being able to see well literally changes your perspective 
of the world," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor vision can confine you to a very small world. And this happens a lot. 
Especially among those with lower incomes who can't afford the privilege of 
routine eye exams." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help open up a new world for the working poor, the California 
Vision Project will provide free eye examinations and prescription glasses to 
qualified applicants beginning in November. 
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at people who earn too much money to get MediCal but not 
enough to afford health insurance, said Holden, project chairman for Ventura, 
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
With an average one-hour basic exam costing about $65, and prescription glasses 
often starting at $75, many of the working poor forgo an eye exam because it 
does not seem like an immediate necessity, Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
But not only do optometrists provide corrective care, they can also discover 
eye disease that can lead to vision loss if not caught and treated. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should go blind just because they don't have enough money for 
insurance," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, during the first California Vision Project, participating 
optometrists examined about 3,000 people statewide, and officials are expecting 
twice as many patients this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army's Oxnard and Ventura offices are accepting applications 
through Oct. 12 for this year's project. 
</P>
<P>
Participants must be part of a family in which at least one person is working 
full time, and the household income must be at or below the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
The family cannot be receiving any kind of government assistance or health 
insurance. MAJA RADEVICH

CITY DELAYS BAN ON WATER-WELL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ojai City Council this week delayed adoption of an emergency ban on 
drilling water wells. 
</P>
<P>
Consideration of the measure was delayed until Oct. 9 after City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Widders asked for more time to research legal issues involved in banning 
well drilling where a water shortage exists. 
</P>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District declared an emergency shortage throughout 
the Ojai Valley in April that could continue indefinitely. Southern California 
Water Co., which has held the city's water franchise since 1948 and has 
proposed drilling a new well just outside the city limits, submitted a letter 
to the city objecting to the proposed six-month ban. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company's plan would not be affected by a city ban, the letter 
says well drilling is a matter of private property rights. THIA BELL

IDEAS OFFERED FOR PROPERTY NEAR AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK: WITH LOCKHEED LEAVING, THE CITY MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH A LOT OF 
LAND. SUGGESTIONS INCLUDE RECREATIONAL USES AND AN 'URBAN VILLAGE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank city planners Wednesday presented and listened to a series of long-term 
plans for the land around Burbank Airport, once dominated by the departing 
Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
A community meeting was held at the Burbank Airport Hilton to give the public a 
chance to voice opinions as to how the land should be used. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion was not limited to the approximately 300 acres to be vacated by 
Lockheed, but the planned departure of the aerospace giant prompted the 
discussion about the future of the area around the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank officials want to see the area -- which traditionally has been home to 
heavy, polluting industries -- converted to cleaner uses. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven plans were prepared for the city by a private planning firm, ranging 
from an emphasis on recreational facilities such as golf courses and parks to a 
high-density residential and commercial "urban village." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will select three alternatives in January for further study. 
</P>
<P>
Comments by about 50 people who attended -- homeowners, community activists, 
business operators and others -- addressed concerns that transportation 
alternatives keep pace with development and that new projects not be built 
without careful planning. 
</P>
<P>
Some favored light industrial use at current density, others supported a denser 
mixed-use development of commercial and residential facilities similar to 
Warner Center in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Rick Pruetz said the public comments will be compiled and 
presented to a joint meeting of the City Council and the planning board in 
October. None of the plans is in a final stage, and public hearings on future 
uses for the area will begin in 1991, said associate city planner Bill 
Lundgren. 
</P>
<P>
"These are ideas, but they are not recommendations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a smorgasbord of ideas," said Randy Jackson of The Planning 
Center of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who attended said they saw desirable and undesirable features in 
several plans and encouraged choosing elements from among them. 
</P>
<P>
Since Lockheed announced in May that it was pulling much of its operation out 
of Burbank and leaving behind about 300 acres, city planners have been looking 
for new uses for the property. The availability of the land allows planners to 
recreate Burbank's northwest corner. As part of the plan to control both the 
type and scale of growth in the area, the City Council in May passed an interim 
control ordinance that places tough development restrictions on 1,000 acres 
around the airport for two years. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say the ordinance will buy time for them to make permanent zoning 
changes and formulate a general plan for area that stretches roughly from the 
airport to the Golden State Freeway between Empire Avenue and Cohasset Street. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance affects non-Lockheed property as well, because city officials 
expect many of the nearby businesses that have depended on the aerospace 
company will leave or fold when it leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents and businesses -- including Lockheed itself -- have criticized 
the ordinance, saying that it will frighten new firms out of locating in the 
area. They say vacant property must be put back to use quickly to preserve the 
area's economy. 
</P>
<P>
But any plans for the area may be complicated by the presence of toxic 
substances in the soil and ground water. Federal health officials have said 
they have no accurate estimate of how much hazardous material may have seeped 
into the ground over the years, but the area is the center of cleanup 
operations under the federal government's Superfund program for polluted land. 
All properties must receive a clean bill of health before any development can 
begin.

COURT LETS RULING STAND IN PARENTS' CUSTODY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Wednesday let stand an appeal court's ruling that 
said a Ventura County judge could not settle a custody dispute by forcing the 
mother to move closer to the father. 
</P>
<P>
The court refused to review a ruling issued in July by the 2nd District Court 
of Appeal. The appeal court found that Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Charles R. McGrath exceeded his authority when he forced Pamela Besser Theroux 
to move from San Francisco to Ventura County so her son, Joshua, would not have 
to commute between his parents' homes. 
</P>
<P>
Theroux and Joshua's father, Michael Fingert, lived in Ventura when they were 
divorced in 1981. She was awarded 75% custody, which eventually meant that 
Joshua spent three weeks with his mother followed by one week with his father. 
Fingert lives in Moorpark, Theroux eventually settled in San Francisco and 
Joshua flew back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, McGrath decided that having both parents in the same area 
would reduce the psychological stress on Joshua, who was attending two schools 
and spending one week with his father for every three weeks with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal court ruled in July, however, that McGrath's order violated the 
mother's right to travel, guaranteed by the California and U.S. constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
American Civil Liberties Union attorney Jon Davidson said he did not expect an 
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Fingert nor his attorney, Richard L. Taylor, could be reached Wednesday 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Theroux said she still wants to return to Northern California but the timing is 
uncertain. Her ex-husband has asked Ventura County Superior Court for 50% or 
full custody, Davidson said. The court will hear that case in late October. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we work out a schedule that works out best for Josh, we're just going to 
stay put," Theroux said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

DRIVER PLEADS GUILTY IN CRASH THAT KILLED 2 STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Palmdale man pleaded guilty Wednesday to two counts of second-degree murder 
in the deaths of two high school students whose car he broadsided in Mission 
Hills while fleeing from police in his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Vargas Servin, 22, also agreed to a prison term of 20 years to life, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels said. Servin will be sentenced Oct. 17 in Van Nuys 
Superior Court, Samuels said. Had he been convicted in a jury trial that was 
scheduled to begin Wednesday, he could have received a sentence of 36 years to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Servin, who on Tuesday listened in court to a 20-minute tape-recorded 
confession he made to police shortly after the crash, entered the plea 
Wednesday morning after consulting with his attorney, William M. Thornbury. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors dropped a charge of causing death 
while evading police, for which he could have received an additional 
eight-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Servin's brother, Jose Servin, 25, of Palmdale, said outside the court 
Wednesday that his brother deeply regrets causing the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother says if he could give his life for them to come back, he would," 
Jose Servin said. "But it's God's hand. I pray for the families." 
</P>
<P>
Samuels said that despite the plea agreement, Servin will receive the same 
sentence her office would have requested in the event of a jury conviction. She 
said she would have asked that the murder counts, which each carry a maximum 
sentence of 15 years, be served concurrently, and that he receive an additional 
five years because he was on parole for a robbery conviction at the time of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us feel it was just an outrageously reckless act," Samuels said. "But 
it wasn't intentional. It's a tragic case." 
</P>
<P>
On June 1, Servin fired two or three shots with a pistol into the air during a 
fight outside a residence and then fled from a pursuing San Fernando police 
officer. He later told police that he fired the shots to scare off a man who 
had pointed a shotgun at him. 
</P>
<P>
After running three stop signs, Servin ran a red light at Chatsworth Drive and 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard and struck a car carrying three students returning from 
a high school football game. Aracely Hernandez, 18, of San Fernando and Uriel 
Fernandez, 16, of Pacoima were killed. The third occupant, Juan Melendrez, 16, 
was hospitalized with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Servin ran away after the crash and hid in bushes, but police found him a short 
time later. A .38-caliber revolver was found under the pickup's dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
Servin said he drank more than 18 cans of beer in the five hours before the 
9:10 p.m. crash and did not see the red light at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
He told detectives that he tried to flee because he did not want to return to 
prison. Servin had been released on parole less than a year earlier after 
serving terms for robbery and joy riding.

BOYARSKY'S MAGNOLIA COLUMN CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Boyarsky's recent column presents a very one-sided view of a city effort 
that is just now reaching a point where big things could happen. 
</P>
<P>
I am the business person who paid for the bus bench slogan, "Look Out Melrose! 
Magnolia Boulevard Is Soon to Arrive." 
</P>
<P>
As a 20-year resident of North Hollywood, I put the slogan on the bench to 
inspire others to see beyond yesterday. I am converting a rundown coffeehouse 
on Magnolia into an upscale eatery precisely because the city, with CRA as the 
operating arm, is bringing lasting improvements to the area. 
</P>

I am hopeful that other business people have the vision to join with the CRA in 
the improvement effort by digging deeply into their own pockets. One does not 
expect this of the purveyor of $1.85 tires or the operator of the three

SAN FERNANDO WORKERS OK PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando city employees have ratified a two-year contract that includes 
salary increases ranging from 9.5% to 18.3%. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 city workers represented by the California League of City Employees 
Local 690 voted to accept the contract in a secret ballot counted earlier this 
week, said Jane Herran, city personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
The employees had been working without a contract since June 30; negotiations 
were declared at an impasse in early August. 
</P>
<P>
But union negotiators reconsidered the city's final offer after the City 
Council on Aug. 20 imposed a one-year contract on the union that provided for a 
5.49% raise, Herran said. The union represents all city workers with the 
exception of police officers and management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, Herran said, all workers covered by the contract will 
receive a 4% salary increase retroactive to Aug. 1 and another 1.5% pay raise 
effective Dec. 29. During the contract's second year, beginning June 29, 
employees will receive a minimum 4% and a maximum 6% pay hike, depending on the 
consumer price index, Herran said. 
</P>
<P>
Community service officers in the Police Department will receive an additional 
4.4% pay hike in the first year and another 4.4% during the second year of the 
contract, Herran said. The contract also gives police clerks and certain Water 
Department employees additional pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
The union had asked for a pay increase of 6% for the first six months and an 
additional 2% for the second half of the first year of the contract. It sought 
a cost-of-living increase plus 2% for the second year. 
</P>
<P>
Herran said the contract also calls for an increase in bonus pay for bilingual 
workers. In addition, the city agreed for the first time to pay the full cost 
of employees' medical, dental and vision care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the contract earlier this month, Herran said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTORCYCLIST DIES IN COLLISION WITH CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old man was killed when his motorcycle collided with a car at a Sun 
Valley intersection, Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Loaiza, of Sun Valley died about 8:45 p.m. Tuesday in the accident at 
Sunland Boulevard and Nettleton Street, Sgt. John Amott said. Maria Duarte, 34, 
of Sun Valley, who was driving the car that collided with the motorcycle, was 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Amott said Duarte was northbound on Sunland Boulevard and attempted to turn 
left onto Nettleton when her car struck the oncoming motorcycle. The accident 
is still under investigation and police have not determined whether Duarte 
improperly pulled in front of Loaiza or the motorcycle was speeding, Amott 
said.

L.A. TO PAY $1,000 A DAY FOR DUMP EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has agreed to pay a $1,000 penalty for each day it 
fails to meet deadlines in installing an expanded system to control methane gas 
emissions at Lopez Canyon Landfill in Lake View Terrace, city and regional air 
quality officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That amount will be included in a civil agreement between the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District and the City Bureau of Sanitation to be presented 
to the City Council next month, AQMD chief prosecutor Diana Love told a 
community meeting at the office of Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
Love said the civil agreement will contain the same provisions as a proposed 
settlement that will be presented to an AQMD hearing board, which has been 
investigating noxious fumes at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Both the agreement and the order include gas-control measures added at a 
meeting set up by Katz last week between AQMD and city officials and the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Already included in the agreement with the city is a provision that the city 
pay a $5,000 fine for each day it violates state laws on gas emissions at the 
landfill. This money would go into a community fund that would be administered 
by Councilman Ernani Bernardi, Katz told about 25 members of the public at 
Wednesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The separate $1,000 payment for each day of violations would go to the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
Love called the agreements the most stringent imposed on any dump in the AQMD's 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Zapple of Kagle Canyon, who has led the neighborhood fight against the 
landfill, questioned the $1,000 amount, saying "it's not even chump change to 
the City Council." But Love said that at $1,000 daily, "That's $30,000 a month, 
folks. And that's a lot of money."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
RIGHT COURSE FOR MODERN WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few would have guessed that UC Irvine would celebrate its 25th anniversary this 
year with a student body that is 66% nonwhite. Such are the changing 
demographics in Orange County and Southern California. UCI's fall freshman 
class is 43% Asian, 37% Caucasian, 14% Latino, 4% black, .8% American Indian 
and 5% other students. 
</P>
<P>
Given this ethnic diversity, UCI's faculty wisely decided to begin this year 
requiring undergraduate students to take two courses -- selected from among 
almost 200 -- aimed at diversifying their viewpoints. The change comes at a 
time when UCI is making a laudable effort to make its general education 
requirements tougher and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
One of the required courses would examine the culture or history of one or more 
minority groups in the United States, including women, blacks, Asians and 
Latinos. The other would explore the culture, history, political, economic or 
sociological aspects of one or more foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, beginning in 1992, students will be required to take three 
quarters of a foreign language. The following year, that will jump to four 
quarters. Currently, many graduate without any language studies. 
</P>
<P>
The new course requirements have been instituted in response to a different 
political reality from the turbulent '60s, when black or women's studies 
programs sprang up. Today, there is a recognition that the world grows smaller 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's faculty, by adopting the new course requirements, is signaling that the 
traditional Euro-American view of history and politics is no longer enough to 
prepare young people for the complex problems they will face. The 
administration should also broaden its faculty, now 85% white males, to include 
more minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
Still, UCI, with its burgeoning 16,500-student campus and 900 faculty members, 
could celebrate its anniversary only with hoopla. By adopting the new course 
requirements, it also takes a step into the future.

BLOCK CALLS BRUTALITY SUIT A PLOY BY GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block -- stung by what he called "horror stories" in a federal 
lawsuit -- vehemently denied Wednesday that deputies in Lynwood engaged in 
excessive force, and he called the complaint a ploy by gang members to 
discredit his department. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights attorneys representing 81 plaintiffs leveled the allegations in a 
massive lawsuit lodged Tuesday with the U.S. District Court. The class-action 
suit names Block and 22 of his Lynwood station deputies as defendants and seeks 
an injunction placing the station under court control. 
</P>
<P>
Block, speaking at his monthly news conference, called the complaint 
"ludicrous" and said many of the plaintiffs are gang members facing criminal 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that much of this has the smell, if you will, of a group of gang 
members in the community who, perhaps, are banding together and trying to 
discredit the deputies who work in this area," the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that Block and other top law enforcement officials have 
failed to control deputies in the Lynwood station -- which has 154 sworn 
deputies covering 7.6 square miles in Lynwood, Compton, Willowbrook and an 
unincorporated Los Angeles County area. It cited more than 40 alleged incidents 
this year of "shooting, killing, brutality, terrorism, house-trashing and other 
acts of lawlessness" by deputies, including two deaths and dozens of beatings. 
</P>
<P>
Block angrily disputed the allegations and denied that the department has 
failed to discipline deputies. Block said some Lynwood deputies have been 
punished for excessive force over the years, along with those from other 
stations, but he provided no specifics. 
</P>
<P>
"We will stand by our record, and I take personal offense to some of the 
content of these allegations as to the fact that I condone and encourage and 
fail to act upon these actions when they are brought to my attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Block refused to talk about any specific cases but said that nearly half of the 
plaintiffs in the suit are suspected gang members rousted during house searches 
last March after an apparent gang shooting. 
</P>
<P>
George V. Denny III, the lead attorney in the case, acknowledged Wednesday that 
some plaintiffs in the lawsuit are former or present gang members. But he said 
the majority of the plaintiffs have no gang ties -- and those arrested were 
improperly charged with assault on officers and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that the biggest gang in Los Angeles County is the sheriff's 
olive-green gang," Denny said. "They have colors. They have signs they flash to 
one another. They are very territorial, and they are trying to make Lynwood 
their turf." 
</P>
<P>
Denny, along with attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
and the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, Tuesday accused Block of 
ignoring brutality complaints against Lynwood deputies. Denny gave reporters 
copies of an April 30 letter to Block asking for an investigation of five of 
the cases outlined in the lawsuit. A letter from Block on May 23 promised a 
"thorough investigation. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Block said he could not recall the specifics of Denny's letter. However, he 
said that his department's Internal Investigations Bureau had only one 
complaint from a plaintiff in the suit, and that case -- which he would not 
identify -- was still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"So the allegation that we failed to investigate (and) to properly discipline 
where appropriate . . . is somewhat hypocritical in the fact that these 
incidents have not been the subject of complaints to our department," said 
Block. Meanwhile, he blamed rising street violence for the "commensurate 
increase in violent confrontations between law enforcement and these 
violence-prone individuals." 
</P>
<P>
In a Times story last May, Block had acknowledged that excessive force has been 
a concern of his department since a 1985 internal study cited it as one of 
several ethical problems that needed attention. The study led to a $300,000 
program requiring every deputy to attend a daylong seminar on ethics, including 
techniques to avoid violent confrontations. Block said all 8,000 sworn officers 
have participated. 
</P>
<P>
The Times also reported that excessive force lawsuits had nearly doubled over 
the last five years, and such cases cost the county $8.5 million in settlements 
and jury awards during a three-year period ending last September. 
</P>
<P>
In lamenting the "list of horror stories" in the Lynwood suit, Block said the 
sheer number of complaints will ensure that his department will investigate the 
allegations. But he added that the document "is full of defamatory statements" 
and emphasized that there is no evidence that Lynwood deputies consistently use 
excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Other defendants include the county, the city of Lynwood, the Sheriff's 
Department, the commander of the Lynwood station, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de and 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks no specific monetary damages. Plaintiffs, however, asked for an 
injunction placing the Lynwood station under a "law enforcement master." Block 
labeled the request a "grandstand play." 
</P>
<P>
Some law enforcement officials and legal scholars said the move was highly 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"To my knowledge, I have never heard of that civil remedy," said James Ginger, 
deputy director of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research and technical 
assistance organization in Washington. "It would create a situation where you 
would have some people who remain under the sheriff but not under his direct 
control. . . . That could create problems." 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Goldstein, a UCLA law professor who has taught courses in civil 
rights legislation, also said the plaintiffs' request for a receiver will face 
legal hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to persuade a federal court to intervene at all in 
regulating a police force through an injunction," he said.

U.S. WILL SELL OIL FROM RESERVES TO HOLD DOWN PRICE; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: 5 MILLION BARRELS WILL GO ON THE BLOCK. FURTHER STEPS MAY BE 
NECESSARY, THE PRESIDENT SAYS.

<TEXT>
<P>
With spot-market oil prices topping $40 a barrel for the first time in a 
decade, President Bush on Wednesday announced plans to sell 5 million barrels 
of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to curb "intensive and 
unwarranted speculation in oil futures." 
</P>
<P>
The sale, which White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater described as a 
"demonstration test" of the 590-million-barrel reserve, is aimed directly at 
"those speculators who might try to drive up the price of oil," Bush said in a 
speech to a Republican fund-raising dinner in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Should the current sale prove insufficient to calm frenzied oil markets, "I am 
prepared to take additional steps, if necessary, to ensure that America stays 
strong right here at home," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Although "the oil market is very tight, with little spare capacity, there is 
sufficient oil to meet current needs," Bush said. "There is no justification 
for the intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures." 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented release of oil from the 15-year-old reserve comes eight weeks 
after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring and led to 
widespread demands that Bush open the reserve to moderate price boosts. 
</P>
<P>
The 5 million barrels the Administration is now releasing is less than the 
amount the United States imports in a single day. But Bush and his aides hope 
that the small test release will calm markets by demonstrating the 
Administration's resolve. The full reserve could replace all U.S. imports for 
about three months. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices, which more than doubled in the days immediately after Iraq's Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait, have jumped again in recent days, fueled by rumors of war 
and speculation about possible Iraqi attacks on Saudi Arabia's massive oil 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
The current price increases "could not be entirely based on legitimate market 
factors," Fitzwater said, although he added that the Energy Department has 
found no evidence of price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
"We're acting against what we believe is speculation in terms of unwarranted 
price increases," Fitzwater said, adding that Bush is concerned that the price 
situation could grow worse with the onset of the fall and winter heating 
season. "We need to make it clear that we do have oil available to put on the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry experts generally agree that recent price increases indicate that 
fear has overwhelmed the hard facts of the world oil supply. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that the price increases we've seen over the last week or so, 
taken into the mid and high $30s, were not a product of the pure supply-demand 
fundamentals as we see them today, but rather a reflection of the market's 
anxieties about the risks of (military) escalation," said John Treat, an oil 
analyst with Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton in San Francisco and former energy 
adviser to President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the supply and demand, oil prices should be in the mid to high $20 
range, Treat said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the spot-market price for Britain's North Sea Brent oil, a widely 
traded oil future, peaked at more than $40 a barrel Wednesday before falling 
off slightly late in the day. Futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate, 
the benchmark U.S. oil, rose to $39.20 during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Prices that high have not been reached since 1980, in the early days of the 
Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amount of oil being released is negligible in a world market that 
produces roughly 60 million barrels of oil every day, economists said the 
effect on oil prices should be immediate and dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
"It could (drop) $3 a barrel. It could be $5," depending on the timing of the 
release, said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a leading oil industry economist with the 
Institute for International Economics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The psychological impact could be quite significant," said Thomas G. Burns, 
manager of economics at Chevron Corp. in San Francisco. "The message that's 
sent is that, No. 1, the strategic reserve is there, it is available, it does 
work, and the President is willing to use it for these purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"And once you have it open, it's much easier to open it all the way," he added. 
</P>
<P>
That last factor may have been part of Bush's decision to tap the reserve now 
after resisting doing so for nearly two months. According to Administration 
officials, the President initially feared that any quick move to tap the 
reserve would backfire by convincing consumers that a true shortage existed, 
setting off panic buying. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress have been urging Bush to tap the reserve. "Clearly this is 
the kind of economic hardship the SPR was designed to reduce," a group of House 
Democrats declared earlier this week in a letter to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, as the cost of oil has soared, Bush has publicly softened his 
position, with Energy Department officials warning that shortages could become 
severe as demand increases to meet the beginning of the fall and winter heating 
season. Waiting until that point to release the first oil from the reserve 
could have set off a major price panic, officials feared. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Fitzwater said, Bush -- who spent nearly 20 years as an oilman in 
Texas before becoming a politician -- made his decision "reluctantly." 
</P>
<P>
World oil markets lost 4.8 million barrels of daily oil production when the 
United Nations imposed an embargo on Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Since then, 
increased production by Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and other oil exporters has 
replaced about two-thirds of that crude oil. A daily shortage of between 1.5 
million and 1.7 million barrels each day remains, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The United States uses about 17 million barrels of oil each day, importing 
somewhat less than half of that total. Imports from the Middle East account for 
roughly 30% of U.S. supplies. Iraq and Kuwait together accounted for only a 
small percentage of oil used in the United States, about 730,000 barrels per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The strategic reserve -- a massive lake of oil stored in underground salt domes 
along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico -- was created by Congress in 1975 to 
assure the country an adequate supply of oil in the event of an international 
crisis. Until now, it had been never been tapped to ease market shortages. 
</P>
<P>
A 1-million-barrel test was conducted in 1985 to try out the government's 
ability to retrieve oil from the reserve when needed. 
</P>
<P>
The actual delivery of oil from the reserve will take 30 to 60 days, Fitzwater 
said. The government will publish a formal notice of sale, then take bids from 
buyers. Profits from the sale will go into the general treasury. 
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a critical insurance policy for the United States, and it's 
tremendously important that we know the oil can be recovered and put into the 
system in a timely and effective fashion," said Arthur Wiese, a spokesman for 
the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which established the 
reserve, the stockpiles can be drawn on when the President determines that such 
action is "required by a severe energy supply interruption." 
</P>
<P>
The government has elaborate plans to consult with other major nations with oil 
stockpiles before tapping the petroleum reserve. Western Europe and Japan 
together have similar reserves totaling about 400 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said other nations are not planning to tap their stockpiles at this 
point, however. "They don't feel it is necessary at this time," Fitzwater said, 
"and we don't see the need." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Washington on Wednesday, Iran's minister of economic affairs and 
finance urged Western nations to "use their current reserves to relieve the 
current pressure on the international oil market and to restore stability." 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, a stable international oil market will be 
beneficial for both the oil producers and the consumers," Mohsen Nourbakhsh 
told the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Although oil-exporting countries have gotten more revenue from increasing oil 
prices, the cost of their imports has also gone up, Nourbakhsh said. 
</P>

Shogan reported from Chicago and Lauter from Washington. Staff writers Patrick 
Lee, in Los Angeles, and Oswald Johnston, in Washington, contributed to this

TEAMSTERS DISCOVER THE BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
THE UNION BEST KNOWN FOR CORRUPTION IS GETTING A TASTE OF DEMOCRACY. IT IS THE 
MOST PUBLIC LOOK YET INSIDE THE POLITICS OF ORGANIZED LABOR.

<P>
Liberals regularly gather in the living room of economist and publisher Stanley 
Sheinbaum's Brentwood home to raise money for "progressive" causes. 
</P>
<P>
So why on Earth was the guest of honor on a recent Saturday night the first 
announced candidate for the presidency of the International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters? 
</P>
<P>
This is, after all, the union that endorsed Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. 
This is the union that has seen three of its international presidents jailed on 
federal charges since the 1950s and had a fourth die under indictment. This is 
the union whose relationship with organized crime was called "a great American 
scandal" by the Justice Department two years ago. This is the union that pays 
150 of its top officials more than $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
This is the union that Ron Carey -- by all accounts one of the most humble and 
squeaky-clean labor leaders in the United States -- wants to run and reform. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Carey, 54, the longtime head of a Teamster parcel-drivers local 
in New York, would be welcomed to Sheinbaum's home is indicative of the unusual 
support he is enlisting in an unprecedented rank-and-file campaign to become 
international president of the 1.6 million-member Teamsters union, the nation's 
largest trade union. 
</P>
<P>
Carey's long-odds effort became plausible only after the Teamster leadership 
agreed last year to place the union under federal supervision to settle a 
government racketeering lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The special federal rules, which include the first direct election of a 
Teamster president in the union's history in 1991, have created the most public 
exhibition of union politics in the history of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Carey's campaign, loud disagreements have already broken out 
between 71-year-old Teamster President William McCarthy and his top 
lieutenants, one or more of whom may also challenge McCarthy next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like watching a Byzantine empire cracking open," said a California labor 
lawyer who represents several Teamster locals and spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little like watching the inside of a corporation, and it's a little bit 
like what's going on in Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R.," he said. "You've had 
this archaic, frozen system in place for 50 years, where a little group of 
power brokers at the top wheel and deal and run the joint, and now nobody knows 
what's going to happen. The more people know about this (government-supervised) 
process, the less they're willing to predict anything." 
</P>
<P>
The supervised election "provides the union's membership with their first real 
opportunity to clean up their union for themselves," said Michael Goldberg, a 
Delaware law professor who recently completed a study of union reform lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
As Carey's campaign moves into its second year, the contrast between the 
union's do-as-we-please history and his outspoken criticism is bringing him 
national media attention as a rare breed of labor spokesman: articulate enough 
to make a case for organized labor to the public at large, rooted solidly 
enough in working-class culture to maintain credibility with his members. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of being a Teamster," says Carey, an ex-Marine and son of a 
Teamster, who earns $45,000 a year as president of Local 804 in Long Island. 
"And yet I hide from it. If my wife and I are in a social situation, I refrain 
from talking about it because I know what follows: 'What about the Mafia?' The 
first thing that comes out of people is: 'Teamster: mobster. Out for 
themselves.' And that's true." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the Teamsters have chosen their president and 16 vice presidents 
at a convention of handpicked delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the rules governing the union say those delegates have to be 
elected by members of each local, and that the national candidates those 
delegates nominate at the June, 1991, convention must compete in a 
secret-ballot membership election late next year. 
</P>
<P>
How this will play is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
Direct national union elections are rare in the first place. Among major 
unions, only the United Mine Workers and the United Steelworkers of America use 
them. In the case of the Teamsters, unknowns range from the level of membership 
interest to the question of whether Carey, whose name recognition among the 
membership is still extremely low, can raise the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars needed to send campaign mail to the home of each Teamster. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules stem from a Justice Department lawsuit in 1988 that charged the 
union's 18-member executive board with depriving its membership of their right 
to a democratically run union and honestly negotiated contracts through a 
pattern of racketeering -- including a "campaign of fear," 20 murders, a number 
of shootings, bombings and beatings. 
</P>
<P>
Convictions could have led to a court order stripping union leaders of their 
jobs and pension benefits. To avert that, the union's executive board last year 
agreed to allow a three-member, court-appointed panel to oversee the 
organization's affairs. In return the government withdrew its suit. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of activity -- significantly more than Teamster leaders expected when 
they settled the suit -- followed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charles Carberry, a former federal prosecutor who acts as investigations 
officer under the government oversight program, has moved to expel more than 20 
national and local Teamster leaders from the union on grounds of misconduct, 
most of it stemming from associations with organized crime bosses. In moving to 
expel union leaders, Carberry can cite any abuse of the union's own 
constitution and bylaws, such as misuse of union funds or kickbacks from 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.S. District Judge David Edelstein of New York, who approved the federal 
oversight agreement, this summer strengthened the original rules governing next 
year's election. In response to complaints from Teamster dissidents, Edelstein 
ruled that elections of convention delegates in each of the 650 Teamster locals 
must be overseen by federal monitors rather than union officials. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coincidentally, within some Teamster locals, a decade of efforts by the 
prime group of dissidents, the 10,000-member Teamsters for a Democratic Union, 
has begun to pay off. In elections of local presidents from San Diego to New 
Jersey, reformers have defeated half a dozen incumbent local officers. 
</P>
<P>
Carey is not a member of TDU, but he was quickly adopted by the organization, 
which has provided a base of operations. Early this year Carey hired as his 
campaign manager longtime United Mine Workers staff member Ed Burke, a veteran 
of a rank-and-file reform movement within the coal union in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules say that to run for Teamster president, a candidate must be 
"certified" by gathering 38,000 members' signatures on petitions. Carey's 
campaign recruited hundreds of petition coordinators and obtained nearly 60,000 
signatures in 38 states, becoming the first -- and so far the only -- certified 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The timing was critical. Certification assured Carey of campaign advertising 
space in the October and February issues of the Teamster magazine that is sent 
to all members, and which in this month's edition carried more 
government-mandated pages about litigation surrounding the new rules than 
Teamster-generated pages about day-to-day union affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very impressive petition drive. That in itself is a mass movement," 
said Eric Mann, a former auto worker and now director of a Van Nuys-based labor 
think tank who was among the guests who heard Carey speak in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
To be nominated as a candidate on the national ballot, Carey needs the support 
of 98 of the 1,957 delegates to the Teamster convention. "I sleep with those 
numbers," campaign manager Burke says. 
</P>
<P>
Carey is likely to get that far. How many votes he would receive from Teamster 
members in the actual rank-and-file election would depend on how well Carey 
could sell the notion of drastic change. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Riley, president of Teamster Joint Council 42, which covers 165,000 
Southland Teamsters, said he thought there would be few new convention 
delegates elected as a result of Carey's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he regards Carey as lacking the experience to direct a union as 
diverse as the Teamsters, which includes industries from construction to 
airlines to freight to food. 
</P>
<P>
"At meetings he has been in here in Southern California, members have 
questioned him on issues and he was not knowledgeable," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, a short, intense, sad-eyed man, became a Teamster 35 years ago when he 
went to work as a driver for United Parcel Service. He has headed 7,000-member 
Local 804, the biggest UPS local in the Teamsters, for the last 23 years and 
has been highly critical of the national union leadership for approving what he 
calls concessionary contracts. Three years ago, Carey was among a number of 
Teamster dissidents who were so upset by the national UPS contract negotiated 
by the Teamsters that they successfully campaigned for rank-and-file rejection. 
Carey's supporters boast of his modest lifestyle, noting he has lived in the 
same house for 30 years and makes less than the chef who works at Teamster 
headquarters in Washington. Members of his local have provided most of the 
$150,000 that has so far funded his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Carey usually speaks only in general terms about what he would do as Teamster 
president. He would, he says, improve pensions, bargain more aggressively with 
employers, fire officials he found lacking integrity and eliminate the 
multiple-salary policy that allows executives of the union to draw paychecks 
for each of the positions they hold. It is not unusual for a Teamster leader to 
draw salaries from the international office, a regional office and his local. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have today is corporate unionism," Carey told his audience in 
Sheinbaum's house, alluding to persistent criticisms from Teamster dissidents 
that the leadership is detached from the rank and file. "We have to get back to 
having a union that's a union . . . they (Teamster leaders) have nothing in 
common with working people . . . we've got to get the bums out." 
</P>
<P>
Teamster leaders, having battled these accusations for generations, dismiss 
them as applicable only in a handful of unfortunate cases. McCarthy himself 
rarely grants interviews. He wrote in the Teamster magazine earlier this year 
that he had "consistently opposed any settlement (of the government's 
corruption case), maintaining from the outset that the government's entire case 
was groundless and politically motivated to embarrass the Teamsters." 
</P>
<P>
Carey attempts to juggle his duties in Long Island with campaign efforts like 
his recent trip to California. A few days before his appearance at Sheinbaum's 
home, he flew from San Diego to Los Angeles, slept three hours and awoke at 2 
in the morning. In a van driven by Steve MacDonald, a Teamster from a small 
town outside Sacramento who had taken a week's vacation to help the campaign, 
Carey and a few other supporters headed to Barstow to make the rounds of 
freight company employees on their break. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the afternoon, in 92-degree heat, Carey was standing in the 
parking lot of an Alpha Beta warehouse in La Habra, flagging down delivery 
drivers, trying to introduce himself. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know what the (election) process is, or how I fit into the 
picture," he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moya, an Alpha Beta driver, stopped his rig. He and Carey chatted. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to change it (the union leadership), Mike," Carey said urgently. 
"It's going down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Moya had heard of Carey and was glad to add his address to the list of about 
8,000 Teamsters who now receive Carey mailings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need a lot of help," Moya said after Carey had walked away. 
"Changes in the pension plan, corruption. I'd like to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
Does Carey have a chance? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel he has a chance," Moya said. "If the election's on the up and up."

BABY, FAMILY BEAT ODDS IN ESCAPE FROM KUWAIT TO U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chihwaro family, U.S. citizens living in Kuwait City, bluffed their way 
past Iraqi border guards, endured two days jammed into a subcompact car and 
made do with only bread and cheese in the 800-mile journey to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
But it was their baby daughter Miriam, wrapped in red tape almost as surely as 
in a diaper, who stopped their flight back to the United States. Born in the 
confusion after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, she had no birth certificate and 
thus could not be allowed into the United States, her parents were told at the 
U.S. Embassy in Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a month after reaching Syria, the Chihwaros landed in San Diego 
to the teary-eyed jubilation of a dozen relatives who used stateside help to 
get them out of Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe she stayed alive," Georgette Chihwaro said of her six-week-old 
daughter. "She's OK. She's a good girl." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Chihwaro said the family, natives of Lebanon, spent 25 days hiding at 
home after the invasion. Their only foray outside was for Miriam's birth in a 
Kuwait City hospital Aug. 14. On Aug. 26, they fled. 
</P>
<P>
"We left at the right time, because they had closed the border for a couple of 
days, and we moved immediately when they reopened," Chihwaro said. "We used 
papers saying that we belong to Lebanese nationality. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a small Japanese car, and six or seven people stuck in the car. I had 
my 4 1/2-year-old son (Allan) sitting on my lap for . . . the whole trip." 
</P>
<P>
But, once in Syria, their worries weren't over. 
</P>
<P>
"The birth was not documented. Therefore, the State Department could not 
document that it was their child," said Blanca Sauermann, immigration 
caseworker for Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
So their relatives -- Chihwaro's two brothers and a sister and their families 
-- knew they had to help. 
</P>
<P>
"I called everywhere at the State Department," said brother Razallah Chihwaro, 
who owns a hair salon and a deli in downtown San Diego. "The State Department 
was very helpful, but there are so many people who have the same circumstances 
so they really cannot do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an appeal to Bates' office helped resolve the problem. Within 24 
hours, the State Department had the necessary clearance. 
</P>
<P>
Sauermann said she handles 25 to 100 immigration cases a week, but "this one 
was unique, because she's the youngest little victim I've ever come across. For 
something like this to happen to a baby so young, it's bizarre. It's a 
one-in-a-million type of case." 
</P>
<P>
Exhausted, her face pale, Georgette Chihwaro begged off talking to reporters at 
the airport. "Maybe tomorrow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shyly and with his eyes gradually misting over, her son, Norman, 9, said that 
mostly he was not scared. But he remembered the time when the gunfire came 
close. It was on the day Miriam was born, Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the day they started hitting, when she was born," he said. "They hit 
at the palace. There was nobody inside, but we thought it was coming somewhere 
near our house. So we stayed by the door, ready to run out." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Chihwaro, an architect employed by the Kuwaiti public works ministry, 
said he will look for a job in San Diego. All their money and belongings were 
left behind, so they'll be with relatives in Spring Valley for a while, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"All I care about is that we're safe," he said. "Everybody asks, 'How about 
your money? How about your belongings?' I don't care. We're safe. That's all 
that I care about."

BOOST TO POLITICAL UNDERDOGS SEEN;

CAMPAIGN FINANCING: EXPERTS SAY THAT THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN RULES COULD AFFECT 
SEVERAL RACES. A JUDGE OVERTURNED THE LAW LIMITING CONTRIBUTIONS.

<P>
Candidates and political fund-raisers, caught off guard by a federal court 
decision overturning California's campaign contribution limits, predicted 
Wednesday that the ruling will give a major boost to underdog candidates of 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
In some races, they said, the sudden change in campaign financing rules could 
tip the balance between now and the Nov. 6 election, giving a tremendous 
fund-raising advantage to candidates who can rely on a handful of donors for 
large contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can all give more," Democratic treasurer candidate Kathleen Brown told a 
group of contributors after the ruling was announced. "The sky's the limit." 
</P>
<P>
Paving the way for other candidates, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne 
Feinstein became the first to disclose that she is accepting checks from donors 
who had already given her the maximum allowed under the old rules. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission and backers of the initiative 
went to court Wednesday afternoon to seek a stay of the decision by U.S. 
District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton. But their bid to put the Proposition 73 
rules back into effect was delayed at least until Friday, when Karlton has 
scheduled a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
As long as no judge grants a stay of the ruling, candidates are free to raise 
and spend as much as they want, said attorney Joseph Remcho, who represented 
Democratic leaders and labor unions in the successful suit to throw out the 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have people who are willing to contribute at amounts above the limits, 
they ought to go ahead and accept the money," Remcho said. "It would be foolish 
not to exercise that right and thus have less money to get out their message." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73, approved by the voters in 1988, limited contributions to $1,000 
from individuals and up to $5,000 from political committees during the fiscal 
year from July 1 to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In his decision issued Tuesday, Karlton ruled that imposing the limits for each 
fiscal year -- rather than each election cycle -- gave an unfair advantage to 
incumbents in violation of the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Karlton also ruled that a ban on the transfer of funds from one candidate to 
another also was unconstitutional because it was imposed in conjunction with 
the fiscal-year limits. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Karlton's decision, many candidates were adopting a cautious approach, 
waiting before risking the wrath of voters -- and contributors -- by seeking 
huge donations. 
</P>
<P>
In part, that is because the Fair Political Practices Commission has ruled that 
in legislative races candidates are still bound by the contribution limits of 
Proposition 68, a rival initiative also approved by the voters in 1988. The 
rival measure had not taken effect until now because it had garnered fewer 
votes than Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge's ruling stands, the change in fund-raising rules is most likely 
to help statewide candidates -- Republican and Democrat alike -- who trail 
their opponents in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
Most prominently mentioned as beneficiaries of the decision were Democratic 
gubernatorial nominee Feinstein, Republican state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, 
state Sen. Marian Bergeson, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, and Joan 
Milke Flores, the Republican nominee for secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Flores fund-raiser Joyce Valdez predicted that the ability to seek 
large sums from the Los Angeles city councilwoman's loyal donors would enable 
her to defeat Democratic Secretary of State March Fong Eu. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the difference between winning and losing," Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hayes is the incumbent treasurer, he has trailed more than $1 million 
behind Brown in campaign contributions. The change in the rules would allow him 
to solicit large donations from the financial community that is affected by the 
treasurer's actions. Hayes issued a statement saying he would not accept 
contributions over the Proposition 73 limit "until the courts can clarify the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
The potential boost for the Republican Hayes at the expense of Brown puts an 
odd personal twist on the campaign financing issue. Brown's brother, former 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., helped push for the judge's ruling in his current 
post as chairman of the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Some candidates, including GOP gubernatorial nominee Pete Wilson, Secretary of 
State Eu, Hayes and Democratic attorney general nominee Arlo Smith responded to 
the judge's action by calling on their opponents to abide by the old $1,000 
contribution limit. 
</P>
<P>
Flores has not decided whether to follow such self-imposed limits. Republican 
attorney general nominee Dan Lungren said he will not take any contributions 
exceeding the limit until Karlton decides on a stay. 
</P>
<P>
The change is expected to have the most effect on the race for governor, where 
the stakes are highest and contributors usually give the most. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in a luncheon address to Los Angeles County Republican Women, called 
the court's decision "one of the worst in memory." The ruling, he said, 
constitutes a "reversion to the law of the jungle . . . when we had government 
by fat cats." 
</P>
<P>
In the last reporting period, Wilson had $3.9 million in the bank compared to 
Feinstein's $645,000. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's decision to accept any level of contribution, Wilson said, will 
mark her as the candidate of the special interests and the status quo. That is 
a label Feinstein has been attempting to hang on Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But the California senator said he also will accept donations above the $1,000 
level in the absence of an agreement between the two candidates to abide by the 
old limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't intend to just turn the other cheek, but I will tell you I think it 
is very wrong," Wilson told the Associated Press. "We may have to fight fire 
with fire." 
</P>
<P>
Dee Dee Meyers, Feinstein's press secretary, said the campaign has begun 
soliciting larger donations. "Quite frankly, there's still a lot of questions 
out there. But for the moment we're asking people for contributions who are 
already maxed out and . . . we're telling them to go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), one of the plaintiffs in the 
lawsuit, said he would follow Proposition 73 "through the election until there 
is a final decision." In particular, Brown said he would abide by the 
initiative's ban on transferring money among candidates. "I'm not going to 
transfer a nickel," Brown told a reporter at a reception he hosted on 
Feinstein's behalf for Capitol lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Two authors of Proposition 73, Assembly GOP Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra and 
Independent Sen. Quentin Kopp of San Francisco, joined in seeking a stay of the 
order from Karlton and also filed a separate appeal Wednesday with the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson argued that the judge's decision just six weeks before the election has 
left candidates in "utter chaos" over what rules to follow. He criticized the 
judge for waiting so long to issue his ruling when the trial ended last April. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Holton, a lobbyist for Common Cause, urged voters to clear up the 
confusion by approving Proposition 131 on the Nov. 6 ballot. The initiative 
would replace both Proposition 73 and Proposition 68 with new campaign rules, 
including public financing of campaigns and contribution limits.

<P>
FUND-RAISING LIMITS: IMPACT ON KEY RACES 
</P>
<P>
 The federal judge's decision to strike down the fund-raising limits imposed by 
the 1988 voter-approved initiative Proposition 73 could markedly reshape a 
number of statewide races prior to the Nov. 6 general election. Here are some 
scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein: In 
the last reporting period, Republican Wilson was raising money at twice 
Feinstein's rate and had $3.9 million in the bank, compared to the Democrat's 
$645,000. While Feinstein's campaign has little hope of matching Wilson, 
donations from well-heeled Democrats could boost her closer to Wilson's level 
and ensure an adequate supply of money for last-minute television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S RACE, Democrat Leo T. McCarthy and Repulican Marian 
Bergeson: Incumbent McCarthy had raised just over $1 million and had $485,000 
in the bank as of the latest reports. Bergeson had raised $798,555 but had only 
$4,000 on hand. Bergeson might seek contributions from her Senate colleagues, 
to whom she has been generous over the years with donations raised from her 
lucrative Orange County political base. 
</P>
<P>
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RACE, Republican Dan Lungren and Democrat Arlo Smith: 
Smith and Lungren each had about $200,000 cash on hand at the end of the most 
recent reporting period. Either could receive major contributions from special 
interest groups: Smith from union, abortion rights and environmental protection 
interests and Lungren from big business and anti-abortion interests. 
</P>
<P>
TREASURER'S RACE, Republican Thomas W. Hayes and Democrat Kathleen Brown: 
During the primary, incumbent Treasurer Hayes raised just over $1 million, 
while Brown raised $2.1 million. Hayes stands to be the big gainer since a 
tough primary left him with just $24,000 in the bank, while Brown had $1.2 
million left. 
</P>
<P>
SECRETARY OF STATE, Democrat March Fong Eu and Republican Joan Milke Flores: A 
campaign without contribution limits would favor challenger Flores, who has 
cultivated a loyal core of contributors as a member of the Los Angeles City 
Council. Flores, who expects to lay out $1 million, already is expected to 
outspend incumbent Eu, who has said she will spend half that amount. But 
strategists say Flores will need even more money to topple the four-term 
incumbent.

An attempt to kidnap or kill a U.S. general working at NATO headquarters in 
Brussels failed after three men broke into his house only to find he was away 
on vacation, sources close to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an incident on the evening of Sept. 25 at the residence of a senior 
U.S. military officer assigned to NATO," a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy said. 
Other sources said the man was a one-star general. "This was an attempt to 
kidnap or kill him, we don't know which," one source said.

SIGNS OF NORMAL CAMPUS LIFE EMERGE AMID ONGOING FEARS

<P>
A month after the brutal slayings of five college students sent shock waves of 
terror through this leafy Southern town, there are signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The walkways on the University of Florida campus are crammed with young 
students. Over 70,000 football fans are expected at Florida Field on Saturday 
when the 17th-ranked Gators take on Ole Miss. 
</P>
<P>
But a chill lingers. For weeks police have talked about having identified eight 
suspects in the grisly murders of four young women and one man near the campus. 
But none, apparently, can be linked to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The task force set up to hunt for the killer has been reduced, and crime lab 
results have failed to provide many telltale clues, according to reports this 
week. Police said they have collected 700 pieces of evidence, and received 
5,000 leads that include everything from sightings of suspicious persons to 
nightmares about ex-boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Police are re-emphasizing that danger persists. Gainesville police Sgt. Dick 
Gerard said he drove around town the other evening and noticed evidence of 
"apathy and complacency" in areas of off-campus housing in which three-fourths 
of the university's 34,000 students live. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw apartments with windows and doors wide open," Gerard said. "And solitary 
joggers. That scares me." 
</P>
<P>
In the days following the slayings many students bought dead-bolt locks, cans 
of Chemical Mace, even handguns. "But now," says 22-year-old junior Scott 
Hankes, "talk is really about school and football." 
</P>
<P>
But what happened here during three days in August is not something this town 
or its residents will forget. "I don't think anyone will ever walk into the 
house without first seeing if someone's there. There's apprehension," says Judy 
Plunkett, 21, editor of the student newspaper, the Alligator. 
</P>
<P>
The horror in Gainesville began sometime before Aug. 26, when the bodies of two 
young women were found slashed and mutilated in the apartment they shared. The 
next day another young woman was found dead in her apartment in a similar 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Aug. 28, a young man and woman were discovered bludgeoned 
and stabbed to death in the apartment they shared. 
</P>
<P>
That week thousands fled the campus, many vowing not to return unless the 
killer was caught. Almost 500 students did drop out. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the murders, Gainesville Police Chief Wayland Clifton waxed 
optimistic that the killer would soon be caught. He described the killer as 
"shrewd and methodical." Clifton is no longer available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
When police began to talk of suspects, the names of two, both in custody, 
became known. But neither seemed to match the profile suggested by Clifton, and 
neither has been charged in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
One was identified as Stephen M. Bates, a 30-year-old fast-food cook from 
Lakeland being held on unrelated burglary and assault charges. The second was 
Edward L. Humphrey, a troubled 18-year-old who has received an enormous amount 
of media attention. A first-year UF student who earlier this summer had lived 
in the apartment building where the bodies of the last two victims were found, 
Humphrey was arrested on charges that he beat his 79-year-old grandmother. 
Since then he has been jailed under a $1-million bond. 
</P>
<P>
University President John Lombardi said Wednesday that he is too busy dealing 
with NCAA sanctions over football and basketball recruiting violations and 
preparing for January budget cuts to wonder about the killer's identity. He is 
angry, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry that such a beautiful thing -- the spirit of this university at the 
start of a semester -- has been destroyed," he says. "I think the police are 
optimistic. But until they arrest somebody, we're counting each day in which 
nothing happens as a victory."

Bid a fond farewell to the mom-and-pop truck stops that once guarded the 
nation's byways. Say so long to homemade apple pie and the owners' wives who 
poured the coffee and the blonde cashier who knew your first name and the best 
route to El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Today's fourth-generation truck stops -- as the industry likes to refer to them 
-- increasingly are part of corporate chains. They are called travel plazas, 
and some, like the one in Gallup, N. M., are so big that golf carts are used to 
shuttle the drivers from their rigs to the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Here on I-95, just north of Richmond, the Virginia Travel Plaza offers drivers 
of the nation's 1 million long-haul trucks a chapel with four pews, two 
restaurants, a Wednesday night shrimp feed, a motel with swimming pool, a pond 
stocked with bass, around-the-clock wake-up service for those who sleep in 
their trucks and, soon, a free movie theater with first-run films. 
</P>
<P>
The Travel Plaza has a payroll of 140 and sprawls over so many acres that 
cashier Faye Derricotte uses binoculars to make out the license plates of rigs 
filling up at the pumps. 
</P>
<P>
From his second-floor office overlooking the pumps and parking lot, plaza 
general manager Creg Strock watched a fleet of $100,000 rigs rumble off the 
interstate at dusk. From Deer Park, Tex., and Liberal, Kan., and Laurel, Miss., 
they came, driven by men whose journey had no final destination. 
</P>
<P>
Strock, a former trucker, mused about how times had changed: The creation of 
the interstate system had made the job more isolated and impersonal; 
deregulation had put some unfit drivers on the road; stories about excessive 
drug and alcohol use and unsafe equipment had tarnished the romantic image of 
truckers as the Last American Cowboys and Knights of the Road. Even the truck 
stops, he admitted, were badly in need of the face lift that is now under way 
throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, if you'd asked me if I'd have let my daughter work at a 
truck stop, I'd have said, 'No way!' " he said. "The image of a truck stop was 
a place with rowdy, vulgar guys and a bunch of lot lizards (prostitutes) 
running around. The industry's come a long way since then, but unfortunately 
the public doesn't realize that." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell you what ruined the truckers' reputation," said George Finney, who drives 
a blue Peterbilt with chromed wheels and fuel tanks, double stacks and an 
extra-wide sleeper bunk. "It was the CB. People drive along the highway and 
they hear truckers talking filthy on the radio, talking about beer and dope and 
women, and it's no wonder people don't think highly of 'em." 
</P>
<P>
When Strock took over as general manager in April, the Virginia Travel Plaza 
had gotten so ratty that business had fallen off 60% and several Southern 
trucking companies had ordered their drivers not to use the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the upstairs bar that offered live country music -- and caused many of the 
problems -- is closed. Alcohol is banned. Prostitutes have been chased away. A 
private security force patrols the parking lot, and the restaurant offers a 
soup and salad bar and low-cholesterol meals that, at least in part, represent 
an awareness that nowadays 6% of the nation's truck drivers are women. 
</P>
<P>
Business at the Virginia Travel Plaza has shot back toward the levels of a 
decade ago, when the truck stop was known as Jarrell's and was one of the most 
popular way stations on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to free the facility from drugs and alcohol and to tidy up a tarnished 
image are being duplicated by many of the 4,500 diesel fuel outlets that 
stretch from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
One operator in Ontario, Calif., has spent $500,000 on a chain-link fence 
around his huge parking lot, and in Carlisle, Pa., a sign lets truckers know 
that undercover drug agents are prowling about. "If you're selling, we might be 
buying, and if you're buying, we might be selling," it warns. The message is 
signed by the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In the Virginia Travel Plaza, as Strock surveyed the parking lot from his 
office window, the Driver's Den restaurant, which has a pay phone at each 
table, was filling up. The dinner special was beans and franks, at $2.99, and 
the truckers sat alone, some talking on the phone between forkfuls of dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Truckers came and went, but it was nearly midnight before the crowd in the busy 
restaurant started to thin. In the parking lot, trucks stood side by side like 
a formation of tanks, engines rumbling. One by one they headed out into the 
night, the drivers bound for the next truck stop and their only respite from 
the long, lonely open road.

UNITED NATIONS: BAKER AND SHEVARDNADZE STRESS IMPORTANCE OF SOLIDARITY IN 
CONFRONTING IRAQ.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze agreed Wednesday to redouble U.S.-Soviet efforts to "tighten the 
noose on Saddam Hussein," a senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze spent about half of their four-hour meeting discussing 
the Persian Gulf crisis, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the 
Washington-Moscow solidarity in opposition to the Iraqi president's invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The senior official said the two men considered additional economic steps to 
increase the pressure on Iraq but did not talk about possible military action. 
The official provided no indication of what the additional economic measures 
might entail. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, all of the economic measures that were suggested after President 
Bush's Helsinki summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
earlier this month were imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baker scornfully rejected an Iraqi demand that the U.S. Embassy in 
Kuwait provide the Baghdad authorities with the names of American citizens who 
have taken refuge there and expel all non-diplomats from the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the Iraqi demand "falls under the heading . . . of the three R's: 
We've read it, it's repugnant and we reject it." He said the U.S. government 
has no intention of naming the individuals hiding in the embassy building. 
</P>
<P>
Baker confirmed that Iraq has threatened to hang any American diplomats found 
harboring Americans who have gone into hiding to escape Iraq's roundup of 
foreign men. The Baghdad government issued a similar threat of execution 
earlier to Kuwaitis found to be giving shelter to foreigners. So far, there is 
no indication that any of the threats have been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the latest Iraqi demand would affect U.S. policy of providing haven 
for non-diplomats in Kuwait, Baker said: "Having rejected it, I think you would 
conclude that it doesn't affect the policy approach that the United States is 
following." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government claims that the embassies in Kuwait have lost their 
diplomatic immunity because of Iraq's claim to have annexed the oil-rich 
emirate. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing crisis in the gulf overshadowed arms control, the usual staple 
of U.S.-Soviet negotiations. The senior official said Baker and Shevardnadze 
discussed both the conventional forces in Europe and the strategic arms 
reduction negotiations but made very little progress. 
</P>
<P>
The official said that only about an hour was devoted to the topic, and "they 
simply ran out of time." He said Baker and Shevardnadze will meet at least once 
more before Shevardnadze returns home, and they hope to make some progress on 
arms control at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Arms control has been an issue without a home for weeks. Bush and Gorbachev 
hardly discussed the matter at Helsinki, announcing that Baker and Shevardnadze 
would go into it when they met a few days later in Moscow. When the topic was 
also given short shrift at the Moscow meeting, officials said it would come up 
at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't characterize the meeting as making any progress per se," the senior 
U.S. official said. He said Baker and Shevardnadze had time to do little more 
than review their position. 
</P>
<P>
The official said that U.S. and Soviet arms control negotiators are meeting in 
New York to narrow technical differences before Baker and Shevardnadze meet 
again, probably next week. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis even intruded on the superpower arms control agenda. The 
official said Baker and Shevardnadze agreed that the two countries must give 
much greater emphasis to stopping the spread of nuclear, chemical and 
biological weapons and the ground-to-ground missile systems needed to deliver 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Although Washington and Moscow have agreed on the desirability of 
non-proliferation measures in the past, the official said, the subject has now 
forced its way to the top of the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"This becomes the important arms control item for the '90s," the official said. 
"Iraq gives this a new emphasis because an Iraq with nuclear capability is 
unthinkable. But it is not just Iraq."

CHENEY SEES SIGNS HUSSEIN MAY LASH OUT; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: DEFENSE CHIEF WARNS THAT THE U.S. COMMITMENT IS 'OPEN-ENDED.' HE SAYS 
SANCTIONS ARE 'BEGINNING TO BITE.'

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Wednesday cited increasing indications that 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may lash out militarily and warned that the U.S. 
commitment to thwarting Hussein's takeover of Kuwait is "open-ended." 
</P>
<P>
With the international trade sanctions against Iraq "beginning to bite," a new 
phase of the crisis may have begun in which Hussein "may seek to use his 
military force to try to break the stranglehold that the embargo has imposed," 
Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's rising tide of invective over the last four days may be "the first, 
beginning evidence that in fact he's really beginning to feel the pain," Cheney 
added. 
</P>
<P>
His assessment, delivered in a speech at a conference of business economists, 
focused on the central question posed by this phase of the confrontation: 
whether Hussein will choose to actively fight the embargo, potentially 
triggering a full-scale military clash, or lay back and force the United States 
to maintain international resolve for a protracted period. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's comments came a day after the U.N. Security Council voted to extend 
the embargo with a shut-off of virtually all air traffic to and from Iraq and 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials also said Wednesday that they plan to present to 
Congress, perhaps as early as today, a scaled-down package of arms sales to 
Saudi Arabia. The initial sale of M-1 Abrams tanks, Patriot air defense 
missiles, Apache helicopters and high-technology rocket systems would be worth 
about $7.8 billion and would be followed by a proposal to sell $14 billion 
worth of more weapons early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The second package of weapons would include 24 F-15 fighter aircraft as well as 
refueling aircraft and more Patriot missiles. The proposed arms sale, 
originally drafted as a single package, was broken into two phases after it 
drew strong opposition on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the aerial blockade of Iraq, Cheney said President Bush has not 
ordered the Pentagon to draft plans for using weapons in enforcing the new 
sanctions. But, he added, "there is always the possibility of using U.S. 
military force" to prevent planes from leaving or entering Iraq with goods 
other than food approved for humanitarian purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In a development that could presage U.S. military action, defense sources 
Wednesday confirmed reports that the United States plans to send an American 
aircraft carrier into the Persian Gulf for the first time. The unprecedented 
move was called for by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of all U.S. 
forces that would participate in military action in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Independence, based in San Diego and stationed in the Gulf 
of Oman, is expected to move into the narrow body of water in the next couple 
of days, Pentagon sources said. From a position well inside the gulf, the 
carrier's 90 aircraft could help support a Marine landing on Kuwaiti shores or 
bolster a multipronged air attack on key military and economic targets in 
Kuwait or Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts a little more pressure on Saddam Hussein," said one military officer. 
"It's just one more turn of the vise." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. aircraft carriers, which stretch as far as 1,086 feet and displace as much 
as 89,000 tons, have never operated inside the shallow and constrained Persian 
Gulf because their ability to maneuver out of the way of attacking missiles or 
aircraft is greatly restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that, while the Navy remains concerned about threats from 
Iranian as well as Iraqi forces, the service is eager to send the Independence 
into the gulf well before any shooting might begin. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time to (move in a carrier) is not when there are bullets flying," 
one naval officer said. "If they go in and operate there for a while, they'll 
be a little more comfortable -- their performance will increase." 
</P>
<P>
But officials cautioned that the planned carrier deployment could be canceled 
or rescheduled in the wake of news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to business economists, Cheney described the U.S. deployment of 
forces, which now numbers almost 170,000 in and around Saudi Arabia, as part of 
a " 'don't screw around' school of military strategy" to which President Bush 
subscribes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to send U.S. forces to an area of the world where they may 
become engaged in hostilities," said Cheney, "it is then incumbent upon those 
of us who send them to make absolutely certain that we send enough not just to 
get into trouble, but to get out of trouble successfully should, in fact, 
hostilities develop." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troop strength in and near Kuwait is now estimated at 430,000, with the 
Pentagon increasing its estimates by 70,000 on Tuesday. The Iraqis also have 
deployed about 3,500 tanks and 1,700 artillery pieces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENFORCING THE AIR EMBARGO 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution authorizing the air embargo of flights in and out of Iraq 
specifically bans the shooting down or use of force to stop planes that ignore 
the embargo. Questions remain as to who will do any patrolling of the skies and 
which planes will actually be embargoed. However, according to the Dept. of 
Defense, there are procedures for intercepting aircraft in the air. 
</P>
<P>
1. Voice Commands: An intercepting pilot will attempt to contact a designated 
aircraft by contacting the plane's pilot over established emergency radio 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
2. Wagging the Wing: If no response is received by voice communication, the 
pilot may choose to wiggle his wings up and down to show the other pilot his 
request for him to land immediately or change course. 
</P>
<P>
3. Lower Landing Gear: The pilot may also extend his landing gear to show the 
other pilot that he is being asked to land or change course. At night, this may 
involve turning the landing lights off and on several times to illuminate the 
landing gear to the intercepted aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
4. Firing Across the Bow: A last resort would be for intercepting pilots to 
fire their guns across the front of the plane, but not actually strike the 
plane.

S. AFRICA A-ARMS PROGRAM SINCE '70S TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: CIA DOCUMENTS DISPUTE OFFICIAL DENIALS FROM PRETORIA. 1979 TEST IS 
RECALLED.

<P>
South Africa has had an active nuclear weapons program since at least the 
mid-1970s, despite years of official denials from Pretoria, according to 
recently declassified CIA documents. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa almost certainly conducted an atmospheric test of a low-yield 
nuclear bomb off its coast in 1979, the documents state. Pretoria has never 
acknowledged possession of nuclear weapons and the U.S. government has never 
publicly stated that it believes South Africa is capable of producing them. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the world has assumed that South Africa carried out the Sept. 22, 
1979, test, which was detected by U.S. intelligence satellites, Pretoria has 
clung to its "longstanding practice of cloaking its nuclear intentions in 
ambiguity," the CIA said. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA report also said that Israel cooperated closely with South Africa in 
the 1970s on nuclear weapons programs and provided "various sorts of advanced 
non-nuclear weapons technology to South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the South African Embassy in Washington did not return telephone 
calls seeking comment on the disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy here said that Jerusalem repeatedly has 
denied any cooperation in nuclear weapons matters with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1987, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced it was suspending all 
new weapons development contracts with South Africa, and the Israeli government 
has strictly adhered to that decree, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA report, which was prepared in December, 1979, was released in heavily 
edited form in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This marks the first time that the U.S. government has confirmed that South 
Africa has had a dedicated nuclear weapons program and the U.S. government knew 
about it," Richard Fieldhouse, a senior researcher with the environmental 
group, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fieldhouse added that the disclosures call into question South Africa's stated 
intention to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying that it would be 
"an empty and cynical gesture because South Africa would maintain the ability 
to produce nuclear weapons quickly." 
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa continues to seek nuclear weapons technology from a 
variety of sources, despite international efforts to halt exports of sensitive 
technology to the racially polarized nation. 
</P>
<P>
Fieldhouse noted that the U.S. Customs Service last week raided a Boynton 
Beach, Fla., firm for allegedly selling guidance components for nuclear-capable 
ballistic missiles to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA report, entitled "The 22 September 1979 Event," gives previously 
classified details of the blast off the coast of southern Africa and explores 
the question of who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion was assumed to be a nuclear blast with a yield of less than three 
kilotons, about a quarter the size of the Hiroshima bomb and equivalent to the 
yield of a nuclear-tipped artillery shell. The test was carried out in darkness 
and under heavy cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that South Africa was the only likely source of the test, 
noting that South Africa had an active nuclear weapons development program and 
sufficient supplies of highly enriched uranium to build several small bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the South African government earlier suspended nuclear 
tests planned for two years because "strong U.S. pressure and other 
international reactions appeared to have deflected South Africa at least 
temporarily from testing." 
</P>
<P>
The 1979 explosion was carried out in secrecy over remote waters off South 
Africa's southern coast after the nation's authorities declared the harbor and 
the naval base at Simonstown to be off-limits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Although such a closure might not be required for a nuclear test at sea, it 
could have screened sensitive loading or unloading operations as well as ship 
movements," the agency said.

Black members of Congress have reacted angrily to a racial slur by Japan's 
justice minister, who drew a parallel between blacks and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama formally apologized for telling 
reporters after a trip to a red-light district: "Bad money drives out good 
money, just like in America where the blacks came in and drove out the whites." 
</P>
<P>
Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), referred to earlier remarks disparaging U.S. ethnic 
minorities by Japanese officials and said it seems to be "a national sport of 
Japan."

Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter gained three more votes Wednesday on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, assuring his approval by the panel when it votes 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsements by Sens. 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) and Patrick J. Leahy 
(D-Vt.) brought to 10 the number on the 14-member panel publicly in favor of 
Souter's nomination. None had come out against him by late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Grassley was the last of the committee's six Republicans to announce his 
support. He said he was concerned about Souter's testimony on activism by the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
During his confirmation hearings, Souter said there were instances where the 
court might step in to fill a "vacuum" if the other branches of government fail 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy and Kohl were the third and fourth of the committee Democrats to support 
Souter. Other Democrats on the committee have withheld their endorsement, 
largely because Souter refused to state a position on abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) was pushing for a quick vote by the 
full Senate to put Souter on the bench Monday, the start of the court's fall 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three liberal senators who are not on the committee joined Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) in opposing Souter's nomination. The three are Sens. Bill 
Bradley (D-N.J.), Frank R.Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.).

INCREASE IN COST OF COLLEGE AGAIN OUTSTRIPS INFLATION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TUITION, ROOM AND BOARD PUSH ANNUAL PRICE AT THE MOST EXPENSIVE 
4-YEAR SCHOOLS ABOVE $21,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For the 10th year in a row, the average cost of attending a four-year college 
or university in the United States has increased significantly more than the 
national inflation rate, according to a survey released today by the College 
Board. However, some education officials expect more pressure to limit future 
tuition hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Not including room and board, the average undergraduate at a public four-year 
college this year will pay $1,809 for tuition and fees, up 7% from last year. 
At private four-year colleges, that figure is $9,391, up 8%. The national 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 4.8% for the year ending in July, by when most 
tuitions were set. 
</P>
<P>
When room and board are included, the increases have put the annual cost of an 
education at the priciest private schools above $21,000, unthinkable a 
generation ago. Among the most expensive schools in the nation are Bennington 
College in Vermont ($21,550), Sarah Lawrence College in New York ($21,490), New 
York University ($21,400) and Barnard College in New York ($21,344). Students 
on average need $1,900 more for books, transportation and personal expenses, 
the survey stated. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive in California are Stanford University ($20,210 for tuition, 
fees, room and board) and Pitzer College ($20,170, school officials said, 
although the College Board contends that Pitzer reported $20,505, which would 
top Stanford.) 
</P>
<P>
Californians pay $1,624 in educational fees at UC and $780 at Cal State, both 
below the national average of $1,809 at four-year public schools. However, room 
and board, which vary widely at many California state schools, are nevertheless 
generally higher than the national averages at four-year public institutions 
($3,161, up 5% from 1989) and private schools ($4,153, up 7%). 
</P>
<P>
Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, urged families to 
investigate financial aid and to look at less-expensive schools that may not be 
as famous but offer good educations. 
</P>
<P>
"The tendency to focus on the cost of a relatively small number of high-priced 
colleges simply adds to the confusion and may lead many students and parents to 
panic if they overestimate the cost of college," Stewart said in a prepared 
statement. "About half of all four-year colleges charge under $5,000 for 
tuition and fees." 
</P>
<P>
The 7% increase in public college tuition and fees matched the previous year's 
rise, according to the College Board, the national consortium of schools that 
is best known for sponsoring the Scholastic Aptitude Test. The 8% hike at 
private colleges was one percentage point lower than in 1989 -- a statistic 
that some experts say foreshadows lower increases. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that, except for the very most highly selective and 
prestigious colleges and universities in the country where there is virtually 
no price resistance, we are clearly coming into a period of price resistance," 
said William Moore, president of the Association of Independent California 
Colleges and Universities. "I think we are probably at the time where the 
percentage increases are going to decline." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many schools are studying the cost-cutting example of Stanford, 
which could probably charge whatever it wants, Moore said. Stanford recently 
instituted administrative cutbacks and raised its fees 5.5%, the smallest hike 
in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, colleges are nervous about an ongoing federal investigation into 
allegations of price fixing in tuition at 56 institutions across the country. 
But critics contend there appears to be little change in college pricing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are going to see more turmoil and battling and more name calling 
but I don't yet see the effects of voluntary belt tightening," said Chester 
Finn, a professor of education and public policy at Vanderbilt University and 
former U.S. assistant secretary of education in the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the 1% decrease in the private school inflation, Finn replied: "If 
you had a fever of 105, you are better off with a fever of 104, but you are 
still sick." 
</P>
<P>
College presidents long have complained that their costs are more tied to 
salaries than to the basket of goods and services included in the CPI. But 
after a decade of student anger and government pressure over college costs, 
some schools are aiming to match the CPI soon. 
</P>
<P>
A previous study by the College Board and the American Council on Education 
said that tuition increases were fueled mainly by costs of improved facilities, 
faculty salaries and more student aid, while public universities also were 
affected by limits in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
However, a study by The Chronicle of Higher Education, academia's trade paper, 
showed that non-teaching administrative positions at colleges and universities 
grew 61% between 1975 and 1985, compared to only a 6% increase in the ranks of 
full-time faculty. Education officials say extra administrators were needed for 
new mandates in, among other things, recruiting minorities and protecting the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics complain that the quality of education is rarely improved by tuition 
hikes. "As long as I'm seeing people paying $20,000 a year and people sitting 
in large lecture classes and being taught by teaching assistants who don't 
speak English well, I don't see any way to justify these tuition increases," 
said Martin Nemko, a Berkeley-based education consultant and author. 
</P>
<P>
The College Board survey covered about 2,200 schools.

ALBERTO MORAVIA; POPULAR ITALIAN WRITER TACKLED MODERN ISSUES IN GRAPHIC STYLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Alberto Moravia, a sharp-eyed Roman storyteller who became the grand old man of 
contemporary Italian literature, died here Wednesday in his apartment 
overlooking the Tiber River. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Moravia, a prolific and controversial figure whose literary career spanned six 
decades, died within a few minutes of feeling ill during his morning bath, his 
family said. Moravia's doctor, who had proclaimed the author fit after a 
physical examination Monday, said he suspected a heart attack as the cause of 
death. The funeral is set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Literary and public figures journeyed in a long procession throughout the day 
Wednesday to Moravia's apartment to express their condolences. 
</P>
<P>
Italian President Francesco Cossiga hailed Moravia as a "sharp but very 
sensitive narrator of 20th-Century Italian society, its contradictions, 
bewilderments and anxious search for values." 
</P>
<P>
With his native Rome in all its splendor and scars as the backdrop for most of 
his works, Moravia bluntly and clearly explored sex, alienation and 
middle-class disillusionment in nearly two dozen novels. He was Italy's 
best-known author, and successful movies made from a number of his books fueled 
his widespread international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"In 60 years, Roman society has not changed at all. That's why people still 
read my books," Moravia told a visitor last year to the riverside apartment 
where he wrote, two-fingered on a manual typewriter, for two hours each 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Moravia liked to tell interviewers that, as a sickly child, he was a 
storyteller even before he knew how to read and write. He began his first 
novel, "Gli Indifferenti" ("The Time of Indifference"), fresh out of his teens, 
and paid to have 1,300 copies of it published when he was 21. His last work, an 
interview-style autobiography, "The Life of Alberto Moravia," is within a few 
weeks of publication. 
</P>
<P>
"My life, as, I believe, everybody else's, is chaos. The only continuous line 
is one of literary work," Moravia said in the autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
Moravia's early work outraged the church-dominated Italian society. An 
outspoken iconoclast, Moravia saw his work banned by Fascist authorities in the 
1930s and by the Vatican in the '50s. His novels were prominent on an index of 
works that Catholics were forbidden to read. 
</P>
<P>
"The present Pope is a hick. He is like those medieval Popes who had nothing to 
do with religion and much to do with politics," he told an interviewer on the 
eve of his 80th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Moravia was born Alberto Pincherle in Rome on Nov. 28, 1907. Childhood illness 
left him with a lifelong limp. As a boy, he read, thought and told himself 
stories while others played. He was often bored. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a child, I often put myself in a corner. At home we always spoke 
French, and I'd say, 'Je m'ennuie' -- I'm bored. I am terribly bored in life. 
It is not a boast, but a biological fact. I am only uplifted by strong 
sensations. Like love, or travel," Moravia told an Italian interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting recently on the Persian Gulf crisis, Moravia recalled his own visit 
to Iraq. "What is happening in Iraq doesn't surprise me," he said, "because the 
impression I had of Iraq was of a world that is ferocious and at the same time 
absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Moravia was an inveterate traveler and a man who liked women. In 1986 he 
married Spanish writer Carmen Llera, then 32. The marriage came a few months 
after the death of writer Elsa Morante, from whom he had been separated for 
nearly 25 years. Moravia, who liked his politics left of center, served in his 
70s as an independent leftist member of the European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
In his novels and short stories, Moravia was best known for writing in a 
graphic, readable style while describing complex emotions. "One must try to say 
complicated things in a clear way," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Time of Indifference," Moravia assailed the decadence of the Roman 
middle class during the rise of fascism. Later works were influenced by a 
strong liking for American culture, born while he lectured for a year at 
Columbia University in New York in the mid-1930s. 
</P>
<P>
That, his biting pen, his Jewish ancestry and his leftist politics were more 
than enough to rouse the ire of Benito Mussolini's ruling Fascists on the eve 
of World War II. In 1941, they banned a thinly disguised Moravia novel about a 
grotesque dictator in an imaginary South American country. 
</P>
<P>
When the German army occupied Rome in 1943, Moravia fled south toward Naples, 
living for nine months in mountain villages. That experience inspired the novel 
"La Ciociara," the wrenching account of a woman and her daughter raped by 
"liberating" Moroccan troops while fleeing German invaders. The novel was 
filmed by Vittorio De Sica as "Two Women" and starred Sophia Loren, who won the 
Oscar for best actress of 1961. 
</P>
<P>
A second powerful novel inspired by Moravia's experiences, "La Romana," told 
the story of a Roman prostitute's unavailing search for love in postwar Rome. 
Published in the United States as "The Woman of Rome," the book sold more than 
1 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like my books," Moravia once said. "It's others who like them. My 
books have nothing new for me. . . . My success has always been a great mystery 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Moravia produced a steady stream of novels, short stories, 
travelogues and newspaper columns. Reviews were mixed: Some critics said that 
he had done his best as a young man and that he had nothing more to say. 
</P>
<P>
Unfazed, Moravia kept writing: "I'll carry on as long as I have the strength to 
write," he said last year. "I can't think of any other way to pass the time."

<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. Justice Department attorney investigating the Orange County Republican 
Party's 1988 placement of uniformed guards at polling places in Latino 
neighborhoods said in a recent letter that "it will be difficult" to bring 
criminal charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In the first comment about the nearly two-year criminal investigation, U.S. 
Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Bruce C. Navarro wrote that federal laws may not 
apply because there was no violence involved and that the only laws it has 
found regarding voter intimidation say it is illegal to attempt to alter the 
outcome of a federal race -- not one for state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro, in a response to inquiries by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), added, 
however, that there has not been a final determination about whether criminal 
charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from the decision by county Republican Party leaders and the 
campaign of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) to hire guards at 20 
polling places in predominantly Latino neighborhoods of Santa Ana for the 1988 
general election. Some of the guards carried signs written in Spanish that 
warned non-citizens that it is illegal to vote.

2 BOARD MEMBERS PUT CHILDREN IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TRUSTEES SHIRLEY WEBER AND KAY DAVIS SAID THEIR DECISIONS WERE BASED 
ON THE NEEDS OF THEIR CHILDREN. 
</P>

<P>
Two San Diego city schools trustees send their children to private schools, 
saying that, while they work to make the public system better, it does not best 
meet the needs of their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Shirley Weber moved her son this fall from the gifted program at 
Encanto Elementary School to the fourth grade at Community Preparatory School 
in Southeast San Diego, a private elementary academy with a focus on the 
self-esteem of African-American children. 
</P>
<P>
Her colleague, board president Kay Davis, has put her middle daughter at 
University High School, the secondary school of the San Diego Catholic Diocese 
in Linda Vista, for her senior year, instead of continuing her daughter's study 
at Point Loma High School. 
</P>
<P>
For Davis, it again raises questions about her confidence in public schools, an 
issue that has dogged her periodically since she put an older daughter at La 
Jolla Country Day School in 1982 for her junior high years. At the time, she 
said her family had problems with the discipline and curriculum offerings at 
area junior highs. 
</P>
<P>
Both board members defended their actions in interviews with The Times after a 
board meeting on Tuesday, saying that the moves were individual decisions based 
on the needs of their children, and would not affect their ability to fight for 
better public schools. Weber also has a seventh-grade daughter at Gompers 
Secondary School and Davis has a younger daughter in her sophomore year at 
Point Loma High. 
</P>
<P>
"I am doing the best job I can to make the (public) system better, but as a 
parent I do what is best for my kids, and sometimes that fits with the public 
(system) and sometimes it doesn't fit," Davis said. "I'll take the heat for 
doing what I should for my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Boyle, president of the San Diego Teachers Assn., said Wednesday that the 
trustees "damage the credibility of the district" by refusing to show enough 
faith to enroll their own children. Boyle noted that he continually criticizes 
public school teachers who place their children at private schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just at De Portola (Middle School) on Monday where I asked a teacher why 
she would want to teach in a system that she wouldn't even put her own kid in," 
Boyle said. "With so many options available to kids in the district, such as 
magnet schools and the like, I just don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
"What goes for teachers having faith in the system I'd say goes even more for 
school board members." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Susan Davis said Wednesday that, "on balance" she doesn't believe 
the actions of Weber and Kay Davis present a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone on the board had a long history of rejecting values in public 
schooling, I certainly would wonder, but I don't believe" that is the case 
here, Susan Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I might feel the way they do if I felt there was no way to get a good 
education in the public system, but I've never felt that way because we used 
alternatives in the system for our own sons; our kids went to magnets." 
</P>
<P>
Weber, a trustee for two years, has been a strong, vocal advocate of improving 
district instruction, especially for the Latino and black students who make up 
almost 43% of the district's 122,000 students and whose academic achievement 
lags behind that of white and Asian students. 
</P>
<P>
Weber said the decision to move her son was not based on an academic "crisis" 
or problem with Encanto Elementary but rather on the "fact that there is more 
to child development than reading, writing and math." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want what I've done interpreted as an attack on public schools. It is 
not," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"My son needed a different school, a smaller school which can provide more 
attention to individual children. I was impressed by the staff and principal at 
Community Prep and its whole philosophy, that it is sensitive to the needs of 
all kids, especially African-American males." 
</P>
<P>
Community Prep, established in 1980 by Khalada Salaam, has about 51 students in 
grades kindergarten through sixth, with an average class size of 13. Its 
curriculum includes emphasis on the positive contributions that 
African-Americans can make to the United States and encourages black youth to 
have strong visions for "nation-building" in their communities by becoming 
businessmen or professionals, Salaam said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do could be done in the public school, but teachers there have to see 
(African-American) kids as potential adults and ask whether they want them to 
have strong abilities and skills, and not be persons who don't like themselves, 
who remember teachers as not liking them," Salaam said. 
</P>
<P>
Weber, in defending her decision, said that no public school in San Diego now 
offers the type of education she wants for her son this year. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego city schools has a ways to go for that experience to be available 
for all students," Weber said. "I feel bad (about the publicity) only to the 
extent that all parents don't have the resources that I do to be able to choose 
an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"So my resolve as a public trustee has not weakened and I still need to work to 
create a district that can provide all the alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"And while I may be criticized as a board member for having a child not in 
public school, I will never base a personal decision about my children on a 
political consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, an eight-year veteran who will leave the board in December, said her 
daughter did well at Point Loma last year, earning a 4.0 grade point average, 
but preferred to return to University High, where she had attended during her 
freshman and sophomore years. 
</P>
<P>
(All three of her daughters attended La Jolla Country Day School during their 
junior-high years. Her oldest daughter graduated from Point Loma.) 
</P>
<P>
"Academically, I think Point Loma is as good, if not better, than Uni for the 
most advanced students, but I think a B student gets more attention at Uni 
because of smaller class size," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"And I like the religion classes, where they have hands-on ethics, they tell 
you how to get your personal values together. . . . We should give ethics 
(instruction) in public schools but it would be too controversial, people would 
argue how you define it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, discipline tends to be stronger at the Catholic school and parent 
participation more extensive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her only regret about the controversy, Davis said, is "that every family does 
not have the choice that I do (economically)." For that reason, Davis favors 
the so-called voucher plan, where the government would pay all or a part of a 
child's education, whether or not parents chose to have their children attend a 
public or private school. 
</P>
<P>
"People who know me have never heard me bad-mouth the total public system," she 
said. "and I've never said things are black and white, or perfect, either way."

2 BLACKS CHARGED IN CIVIL RIGHTS ABUSE OF WHITES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE CASE, INVOLVING AN ATTACK IN MISSION BEACH BY A GROUP OF BLACKS WHO 
TARGETED WHITES, IS THE FIRST IN WHICH A STATE CIVIL-RIGHTS LAW IS USED LOCALLY 
AGAINST ANYONE BUT WHITES.

<P>
In the first case of its kind in San Diego County, two black San Diego men have 
been charged with violating the civil rights of whites during an apparent hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from an incident Sunday night at Belmont Park in Mission Beach 
in which six people were injured, including a 5-year-old boy and a 70-year-old 
man, by a group of more than 12 black men, police said. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the victims was white; a black man who was walking with three 
whites was taunted and struck. Witnesses told police that the blacks were 
making racial slurs during the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights statute has been used to charge from 10 to 15 whites of crimes 
against blacks, Hispanics and other minorities in San Diego County since the 
state law's inception in January, 1988, but this is the first time that blacks 
have been charged with violating the rights of whites locally, said Deputy 
District Attorney Luis Aragon. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a unique case here," Aragon said. "I believe there have been a few 
similar charges filed elsewhere in the state but not in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
No one was available to comment from the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People and other black civil rights groups in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Lee Alexander, 19, and Richard Henry Maxey, 25, both of Southeast San 
Diego, pleaded innocent Tuesday at their arraignment in San Diego Municipal 
Court to a battery charge, four counts of assault with a deadly weapon and four 
misdemeanor counts of violating a person's rights because of race, creed or 
color. Alexander also has been charged with a count of felony armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were being held in the San Diego County Jail, Alexander on $62,000 
bail and Maxey on $45,000 bail. Judge Gail Kaneshiro ordered both men to be 
held in jail at least until their preliminary hearing scheduled for Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Aragon said the district attorney's office filed the charges after considering 
possible causes for the attacks along the boardwalk and concluding that the 
suspects assaulted and robbed the victims because they were white. 
</P>
<P>
He said violations of a person's civil rights are "the same in the eyes of the 
law," regardless of the victim's race. 
</P>
<P>
Police are continuing to investigate and Aragon said similar charges could be 
filed against others blacks suspected of participating in the beatings. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks culminated a weekend of violence in the Mission Bay area. A 
17-year-old Long Beach girl was shot to death early Sunday in a Ski Beach 
parking lot in what police are investigating as a possible gang-related attack. 
A 21-year-old man was found shot to death in a Ventura Cove parking lot early 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Beach has been plagued with violence and public drunkenness in recent 
years, and residents and merchants say the problem is worsening in some parts 
of the beach community. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Wright, spokeswoman for South Mission Beach Concerned Citizens, said the 
boardwalk has become a haven for drunks, panhandlers, prostitutes, violence, 
racial tension and generally rowdy behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have given up coming here. It's become very scary to go there at 
night," Wright said. "The racial tension has gotten much worse. There are 
fights down there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said there are too few police in the area and that officers sometimes 
turn their backs to minor crimes. She said drunks and other "undesirables" know 
that jail overcrowding means they can "get away with much more" before police 
will arrest them. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hamel, co-owner of Hamel's Action Sports along the boardwalk, said alcohol 
abuse is the root of many of the area's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hamel sarcastically refers to the area as San Diego's "most integrated ghetto" 
because of the mix of criminals, prostitutes and drunks of all races.

TASK FORCE PROBE IS SECOND LOOK AT OFFICER'S LINK TO PROSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Police Sgt. Sal Salvatierra, whose home, car, locker and desk were 
searched last week by the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, was a subject of a 
1985 internal affairs investigation into allegations that he and other police 
officers had sex with prostitute Cynthia Maine, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators ruled the allegations "not sustained," meaning they could not 
determine whether the claims about the officers were true or false and have 
closed the case, two sources who have knowledge of the probe said. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegations were that Maine was sexually involved with a number of 
officers," said one source, who asked not to be identified. "These are the same 
kind of allegations that are surfacing now." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which is investigating the murders of 43 
women -- mostly prostitutes and transients -- searched Salvatierra's home last 
week and the officers were said by one of the sources to be looking for 
photographs of Maine and slain prostitute Donna Gentile. Law enforcement 
officials said it was well-known that the two were close friends and police 
informants. 
</P>
<P>
Gentile was found slain in East County shortly after testifying against two 
police officials. One was demoted and the other fired. Authorities long have 
theorized that she may have been killed by police because her mouth was filled 
with gravel, a sign of possible retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the task force interviewed Maine's relatives nearly a year ago, they 
searched Salvatierra's home only last Thursday, when news got out about the 
family's frustration that so little progress had been made in Maine's case. 
Salvatierra was transferred to a special projects division pending the outcome 
of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Wednesday that at least five police officers and a former 
officer were under investigation by the task force for their association with 
Maine or Gentile. Salvatierra's attorney, Everett Bobbitt, said police have no 
evidence to link his client with Maine's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said he had no comment about the internal affairs investigation 
involving Salvatierra. Police Cmdr. Leroy Brady said the department had no 
comment about Homicide Task Force matters. Internal affairs investigations 
typically are secret and the results rarely made public. 
</P>
<P>
Task force spokeswoman Bonnie Dumanis would not provide details on anything 
having to do with the police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Should allegations arise about police misconduct, we'll look into it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police officers can be fired for having sexual relations with 
prostitutes, according to department policy. 
</P>
<P>
Maine's family said she was intimately involved with John Fung, a member of the 
narcotics street team, and as an informant, worked closely with Sgt. Dennis 
Sesma, Fung's boss at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Helle, Maine's sister, said Maine often mentioned meeting with 
Salvatierra, who then worked in the gang unit, and Les Oberlies, who worked in 
criminal intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Oberlies, Fung and Sesma did not return telephone calls Wednesday. In an 
interview Tuesday, Sesma said he had no connection with Maine other than 
dealing with her as a police informant. 
</P>
<P>
Sesma said Fung was like a father figure to Maine, providing her with cash from 
his own pocket at times when she was short. It is easy to understand, Sesma 
said, how Maine might have fallen in love with Fung. 
</P>
<P>
But Maine's relatives said Fung returned the affection and began a 1 1/2-year 
sexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Helle, Maine's sister, told The Times on Wednesday that notations in her 
sister's diary indicate that she met Oberlies three times in 1984. They also 
show a number of entries involving Fung. On one page, Maine wrote: "Loose lips 
sink ships, John said." 
</P>
<P>
On another page, Maine wrote: "John called 1st time in two weeks, came over, 
talked 2 hours, headed for bedroom. (Her son) woke up from nap. Oh well." 
</P>
<P>
On another: "Made John 2 dozen chocolate strawberries." Helle said Fung met 
Maine on July 2, 1984, after he arrested her for prostitution and, thereafter, 
she noted the second day of each month in her diary as an anniversary date. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Fung and Oberlies, Helle said, her sister often mentioned that she was 
going to meet Salvatierra and Sesma. She did not know whether the meetings were 
related to her work as an informant, but said Maine never mentioned being 
sexually involved with any of the officers except Fung. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the homicide task force asked for Maine's diary and took some 
photographs from her sister, which they returned two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Helle said two members of the task force interviewed her at that time and asked 
about various officers, including Fung. Task force members and police officers 
Jeff Dean and David Ayers showed her pictures of prostitutes, she said, many of 
whom she did not recognize and all of whose names she did not know. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned the diary two weeks ago, Dean and Ayers told Helle that they 
planned to interview Fung and Maine's former boyfriend, Steve Smith, who is now 
in jail. Fung has since been interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia, or Cindy, Maine was a heroin addict and spent upwards of $700 a day on 
the drug, said her mother, Lynda Coleman. She turned to street-walking, mostly 
along El Cajon Boulevard, to support her habit and met Fung in 1984, her family 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Maine landed in jail in November, 1985, for passing worthless checks, but her 
four-month sentence was cut in half. Court records show that Capt. Mike Tyler 
wrote a letter on her behalf asking that her sentence be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Maine's sister said she decided to provide internal affairs with information 
linking officers with prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I know is that, when she was in jail, she ratted on some cops 
to get out early," Helle said. "She had information about bad cops using 
prostitutes. I'm not sure who they were." 
</P>
<P>
When she got out of jail, Helle said, her sister was frightened because of 
possible retaliation from police officers she had named. 
</P>
<P>
"She had told on police," Helle said. "She was afraid of what she had done." 
</P>
<P>
Two months after her release from prison, Maine disappeared on Feb. 23, 1986. 
Six weeks later, with Steve Smith's general description of her car's location, 
Coleman found Maine's locked yellow Pontiac Sunbird in the parking lot of the 
El Torito Restaurant &amp; Cantina in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Inside were a newspaper dated Feb. 22, 1986; a purse holding a little more than 
two dollars, a cigarette lighter, cigarettes, cosmetics, and a jacket, her 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she reported her daughter's disappearance to the La Mesa and San Diego 
police departments, neither was initially interested in pursuing the case. 
</P>
<P>
But when the task force made a connection between Gentile and Maine late last 
year, they showed interest, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said she holds little hope that her daughter, who would be 31 next 
month, is alive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a two-edged sword," she said. "Sometimes I wish I'd get the call that 
they found her body. My life has to go on. I'm raising her bright 8-year-old 
boy, who knows very little about his mom."

MAN ARRESTED AFTER PRE-DAWN RAMPAGE ON AVENUE IN VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 29-year-old man is in custody after going on an early-morning rampage Tuesday 
in downtown Vista, smashing windows in 13 businesses and destroying a computer 
in one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department investigators don't know why the man, armed with a pipe, 
broke the windows in businesses located in an eight-block area of South Santa 
Fe Avenue, said Detective Don Phelps from the Sheriff's station in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Although still undergoing treatment at San Diego General Hospital for numerous 
cuts to his arms, Joseph Scata of Vista, has been booked at the County Jail in 
connection with a variety of felony and misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
About 5 a.m. Tuesday morning, Sheriff's Deputy W. Anderson got a radio call 
about a man vandalizing businesses near the 500 block of Santa Fe Avenue, 
Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
When Anderson arrived, he saw a man carrying a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
The man allegedly started to rush the deputy but at the last minute turned and 
ran away, Phelps said. The deputy chased the man for a few blocks before 
catching him. 
</P>
<P>
During his rampage, the man apparently sustained severe cuts to his arms and 
was bleeding heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy had lots of blood on him from when he was breaking all those windows," 
Phelps said. "(The deputy) was having a hard time keeping a grip on him." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of other deputies eventually responded to the scene and they were able 
to handcuff the man. 
</P>
<P>
He was booked on assault with a deadly weapon on an officer, second-degree 
burglary, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony vandalism and 12 counts of 
misdemeanor vandalism, a jail spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Sept. 27 arraignment has been scheduled for Scata, who is being held on 
$17,040 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps didn't know if anything had been stolen from the businesses that were 
vandalized, but he said Scata is facing a burglary charge because he allegedly 
entered one of the business and caused thousands of dollars in damage to 
computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
All six front windows at J. B. Maintenance were shattered along with a computer 
monitor and keyboard that were ruined, said Heidi Mueller, a clerk at the 
company in the 100 block of Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
The monitor of another computer was dented but not broken. 
</P>
<P>
It will cost more than $6,000 to replace the windows and computer, said the 
company's owner Ali Soltan. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Superior Court records show that Scata was sentenced to four years' 
probation in 1983 after pleading guilty to possession of cocaine and marijuana, 
a court clerk said.

MORATORIUM LIMITS BUSINESSES ALONG HAWTHORNE BLVD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fed up by complaints about a lack of parking along a one-mile stretch of 
Hawthorne Boulevard, the Hawthorne City Council has reimposed a temporary 
restriction on the kinds of businesses that can lease, rent or buy property in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The first restriction -- a 45-day moratorium prohibiting a change of uses for 
about 50 stores along Hawthorne Boulevard, between El Segundo Boulevard and 
Rosecrans Avenue -- expired last week. The council decided Monday to impose a 
second 45-day moratorium because a parking study that city officials began last 
month is not finished. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants affected by the decision protested that another restriction 
would create a severe hardship on several property owners who have vacancies in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
They said the moratorium -- which prohibits landlords from leasing, renting or 
selling their properties to businesses that differ from the most recent use -- 
makes it difficult to attract new tenants and reduces the value of their 
property. Other merchants complained that city officials should have been able 
to complete the parking study during the previous moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Pilch, an attorney for Albert and Lily Dalva, owners of a building at 
13441 Hawthorne Blvd., said the restriction came at an especially difficult 
time for his clients, one of whom recently underwent a kidney transplant and is 
no longer able to work. Although the Dalvas had agreed to lease their former 
furniture store to 99 Only Stores before the first moratorium took effect on 
Aug. 6, the moratorium has prevented the new tenant from moving in, thereby 
depriving the Dalvas of their only income. 
</P>
<P>
"In the interest of a study, you're going to take the livelihoods away from a 
lot of people," Pilch said. "You are very well going to cost people their 
homes, a roof over their heads, all for the purpose of a study . . . which 
could be accomplished with the tenants in place. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking of any danger to the city of Hawthorne, but we are sure 
talking about a lot of danger to the people who operate these properties," 
Pilch said, adding that, at the very least, the city should exempt property 
owners who have leases pending. 
</P>
<P>
The council nevertheless voted 4-1 to impose a second moratorium with no 
exemptions. Councilwoman Ginny Lambert dissented, saying she could not vote in 
favor of the moratorium because of the hardship it imposed on property owners. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Charles Bookhammer said city officials "have to start somewhere" 
to get a handle on the city's parking problems. In agreeing with Lambert that 
staff members should have finished the report already, Bookhammer said he would 
not vote to extend the moratorium further and urged staff members to finish it 
in 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 100 businesses along Hawthorne Boulevard's targeted area, but 
the moratorium applies only to those built before the city required merchants 
to provide some parking for their employees and customers. Unless those 
properties underwent major remodeling, the owners have not been required to add 
parking, even after the businesses changed hands. As a result, at least half of 
the properties along the one-mile strip lack sufficient parking, said City 
Manager Kenneth Jue. 
</P>
<P>
Although the biggest source of parking is the median strip that divides 
Hawthorne Boulevard, traffic along that thoroughfare has become so fast-moving 
and congested over the past two years that fewer and fewer shoppers are willing 
to park there, said Planning Director Michael Goodson. 
</P>
<P>
"Park in the median and see how safe you feel," Goodson said. "You're in the 
lane of traffic and a simple little curb is all that separates you from the 
fast lane of traffic. People are constantly jaywalking, dodging the cars. 
That's a hazard." 
</P>
<P>
Goodson said the parking study, which he hopes his office will finish by the 
end of next month, will evaluate how the median parking strip can be improved, 
as well as whether the city's current parking standards are too broad or lax.

SEMINAR'S LESSON FOR HARBOR AREA: GANGS KILL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A FUNERAL. PHOTOS OF MURDERED YOUTHS. FRANK TALKS WITH CHILDREN ABOUT 
COCAINE. ALL THESE TACTICS WERE PART OF A DAYLONG EFFORT DESIGNED TO SHOCK 
WILMINGTON RESIDENTS AND MOBILIZE THEM AGAINST GANGS. 
</P>

<P>
The mother wailed over her young son's coffin. 
</P>
<P>
The father stood silent in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
And nearby, a dozen youngsters, from toddlers to teen-agers, seemed oblivious 
to the tragedy. They wore the gang clothes their dead homeboy once wore. They 
looked stone-faced and defiant, ready to follow the path that had marked their 
friend for murder. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was heartbreaking and chilling. It was also make-believe. But real or 
not, the skit on the stage of Wilmington Junior High School last Saturday was 
faithful to 13 funerals that already have taken place this year in the Harbor 
area. Funerals that followed gang killings. Killings that continue. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to curb gang violence by educating parents and children, businessmen and 
community leaders, a coalition of local agencies sponsored a daylong seminar on 
gangs, drugs and graffiti that drew 100 people to the junior high school. The 
event, the first of three in the South Bay, was sponsored by the Community 
Reclamation Project, a federally funded anti-gang effort in Lomita; along with 
Los Angeles police; Community Youth Gang Services, and other area agencies and 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
Its aim, according to CRP's Executive Director Natalie Salazar, was simple 
enough: make everyone understand gangs and where they can lead. "We feel that 
by educating the community, we can get it more involved in coming up with 
solutions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And by dramatizing the funeral and showing photographs of gang violence, 
Salazar added, the organizers hope to steer young people away from gangs, and 
parents toward action. "We want to make it shocking enough to have an impact 
because we find that people don't get involved unless you show it affects 
them," Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
"Death is not beautiful," Los Angeles Police Detective Ira Beaty said during a 
slide show of photographs that opened the program. The slides, one after 
another, showed people beaten and killed by guns, knives, clubs, even run down 
by cars -- part of the gang toll that so far this year has claimed 13 lives in 
the Harbor area, five more than during the same period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Beaty said, the victims of the violence are gang members like the 
young man accidently killed by a blast from a friend's shotgun as they fled 
another gang, or the Harbor City teen-ager gunned down after he shot at a 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
But many times, the violence strikes beyond the gang circle, Beaty said, 
showing more slides. One showed a San Pedro man with a buck knife in his 
temple, the victim of a robbery. Another slide showed the mangled body of a 
young Wilmington man repeatedly run over by a car at Harbor Regional Park in 
revenge for a gang slaying elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The killing in the park, Beaty said, was particularly significant because the 
victim had long before quit his gang. At the time of his murder, he was 
married, had children, was settled into a job, was even going to church, Beaty 
said. But he remained a target of other gangs because, among other things, his 
arms still carried the tattoos of his former gang. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy hadn't been involved in gangs for two years, but they snatched him up 
anyway," Beaty said. 
</P>
<P>
After watching the slide show, one former gang member said he could not shake 
the images of young victims. "It made me realize I could have easily been one 
of the dead bodies on those slides," said Kevin, 27, a tall, soft-spoken 
Harbor-area resident who asked that his last name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
At the age 15, Kevin said, he helped found a gang that today has almost 300 
members. Two years ago, he quit the gang when his son was born. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Kevin said, he spent almost five years in prison and lost so many 
of his friends or family that he quit going to funerals after No. 15. And that 
was five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Kevin said, he was at the seminar because its message was important. That 
message, repeated throughout the day, was that gang violence is growing, more 
people are dying, and that community education and action must replace fear if 
the madness is to end. 
</P>
<P>
"When are we going to have an agenda against gangs? When are we going to say 
we've had enough of the violence?" asked Tony Borbon, director of anti-gang 
programs for Community Service Programs Inc., a nonprofit agency in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, we would not have had a conference like this," Borbon said of 
the seminar, to be repeated Oct. 13 in Harbor City and Nov. 3 in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long way," he said. "But we have to go farther." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, the seminar offered workshops by counselors and Los Angeles 
police on information ranging from how gang members dress themselves -- even 
their tiny children -- to what crack cocaine looks like. And time and again, 
counselors and police told the crowd, which included a score of wanna-be gang 
members, how gangs kill, both each other and innocents. 
</P>
<P>
The stories rang true to former gang members like Kevin. "I've lost friends and 
family. And I've lost peace of mind because once you're in, you're in forever," 
he said, somberly. "You never feel as safe anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The same fear was expressed by gang members' families. 
</P>
<P>
"It scares me every day I walk down the street," said Shirley Wright of 
Wilmington, whose two sons are in gangs. Several times, she said, she's been 
shot at by members of rival gangs. And twice the bullets narrowly missed her 
grandchildren, once when one of them was only 2 months old. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to stop," she said of the violence claiming innocents and gang 
members alike. "I'm tired of holding these kids while they're bleeding to 
death," she said. "I had one die in my arms." 
</P>
<P>
Like others attending the seminar, Wright insisted that the violence will not 
end until communities like Wilmington band together, family by family, block by 
block, to learn about gangs and how to break their grip. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't stop until we take back our families and take back our streets," 
Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Dee Wigginton, president of Mothers Against Gangs: "If we can work 
together, we can bring back some peace to the community." 
</P>
<P>
But until then, the speakers said, the violence and tears will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"The true victims of all the senseless gang violence are the surviving 
relatives: the mothers, the fathers, the sisters, the brothers," said Beaty of 
the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
John Chavez knows that's true. "This (seminar) is kind of opening up some 
painful memories for myself as a kid growing up in East L.A.," said Chavez, 26, 
who helped organize the event as an employee of its financial sponsor, Falcon 
Disposal Service Inc. 
</P>
<P>
A former gang member stabbed seven times by the age of 15, Chavez recalled how 
after one stabbing he could hear his mother's voice as he lay near death in a 
hospital emergency room. "I was almost in a coma, but I could hear her crying 
(that) it was her fault," Chavez said, his voice breaking. "It wasn't."

Chavez told that story to the seminar's participants at lunch. And afterward he 
continued talking about his days as a gang member, at one point lifting up his 
T-shirt to show his scars to John Gramenz, 16, of Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
"Check it out," he told Gramenz. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the teen-ager said the seminar had been informative and sometimes 
moving. "I liked the play," he said, taking a drag on a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
But the event, he said, was not the type that his gang member friends would be 
affected by, let alone attend. "Gang members don't show their feelings. They 
have a heart, but they don't show it around their homeboys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not even at funerals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to stop," said Chris Luna, who played the grieving mother in the skit 
about a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
While on stage, Luna said, she cried as she thought about the funerals she had 
attended. And afterward, when the play was over, she was prepared to cry again 
during a visit to the home of Kevin Price. 
</P>
<P>
Just that afternoon, they had buried Price, 18. One week earlier, he had become 
the 13th person killed this year by Harbor area gangs.

OFFICER FINED FOR HITTING REDONDO HOUSE WITH TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance police officer has been placed on probation and ordered to pay a 
$612 fine after he pleaded no contest in South Bay Municipal Court to 
misdemeanor hit-and-run driving for slamming his truck into a Redondo Beach 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Roland Sabara, 34, still faces possible disciplinary action by his own 
department when an internal affairs investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ron Traber, spokesman for the Torrance Police Department, said state law 
prevents officials from revealing what action the department takes. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Sandra Thompson ordered Sabara last Tuesday to pay the 
fine and serve two years of unsupervised probation after Redondo Beach City 
Prosecutor John Slawson submitted a recommendation urging leniency. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a routine hit-and-run with a person who has a perfect DMV history and 
who (pleaded) at the earliest opportunity, without any motions, trial, etc.," 
Slawson wrote in the report. 
</P>
<P>
Sabara, who faced as much as six months in Los Angeles County Jail and a $1,000 
fine, represented himself in court. He could not be reached Wednesday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sabara was accused of driving his blue 1989 Chevrolet Blazer through a wooden 
fence and into the corner of a house at 615 Diamond St. about 2 a.m. on Aug. 
21. 
</P>
<P>
A witness told police that the driver of the truck backed up and drove off 
without getting out to look at the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Investigating officers found a half-mile trail of fluids that leaked from the 
truck, but the trail dried up before leading them to the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the house, who told police that he slept through the incident, 
found a vanity license plate -- PRFLVSN -- in the debris. It belongs to 
Sabara's truck. 
</P>
<P>
Sabara went to the Redondo Beach Police Department's public counter about 10 
hours after the accident to report his involvement. He said he had fallen 
asleep at the wheel, and reported that he was not under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident.

Photo, 'Third World' CleanupL:It took five months and a lot of prodding. But a 
group of East Wilmington businessmen saw major progress this week in cleaning 
up the once-cluttered area known as the Third World. Above, a worker contracted 
by the Southern Pacific Railroad for a $1.1-million cleanup of railroad land 
along I and Anaheim streets collects rubbish for removal by Apple Tractor 
Service. "It's a great beginning," said David Stoll, below right, as he and 
fellow businessman Manny Louis oversee the cleanup -- the largest such effort 
to date by a property owner in the area. Previously, the Far East Wilmington 
Improvement Assn. had persuaded the cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach to 
clean up their properties in East Wilmington, said Stoll, a co-chairman of the 
group. Los Angeles police also increased patrols to rid the area of drug 
dealers and prostitutes. Now, Stoll said, the association will try to get the 
Port of Los Angeles to clean up its properties and city agencies to pave area 
streets. "There's still work to be done," Stoll said, "but we're moving." BRIAN

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAW OFFERS AID TO HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First-time home buyers in Gardena who earn as much as $70,000 annually will be 
eligible to receive loans from the city under a bill signed Tuesday by Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, introduced by state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), allows the city 
to raise money by issuing revenue bonds that will be loaned to first-time home 
buyers to assist them with down payments. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena officials say the new program will permit them to help middle-class 
residents who would otherwise have to hunt for houses in less-expensive 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the new program have not been worked out, Gardena City Manager Ken 
Landau said Wednesday. But he said the city expects the loans to be available 
immediately after the Dills legislation takes effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in receiving information on the program should call Landau's 
office at 217-9503.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROLLING HILLS OKS TO CABLE PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolling Hills is a step away from getting cable television after the City 
Council Tuesday gave initial approval to an ordinance authorizing a 15-year 
franchise agreement with Times Mirror Cable Television of Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Times Mirror Cable has six months from the effective date 
of the ordinance to obtain building permits and rights of way from the city and 
the Rolling Hills Community Assn. and another year to provide access to the 
city's 684 residences. 
</P>
<P>
If the ordinance is adopted as expected after a public hearing on Oct. 8, it 
will become effective on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Fowler of Times Mirror Cable told the council that Rolling Hills will be 
the first city on the peninsula to be fed cable programs over a fiber-optics 
line. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Craig Nealis said Wednesday that rates have yet to be set for 
customers.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN RENEWAL PLAN PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer and a major Torrance property owner have proposed a $35-million 
redevelopment plan for the city's old downtown area that would include 170 new 
condominiums and 28,000 square feet of retail space. 
</P>
<P>
The four-acre project proposed by Gascon Mar, a development firm based in San 
Diego, and Sam Levy Investments, a Torrance-based property firm, would include 
three parcels in a four-block downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the proposal are plans to shave off the back of the Newberry store 
at Sartori and El Prado avenues to provide more parking spaces. The down-sized 
building would be converted into a market or a series of smaller stores. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two companies also told City Council members Tuesday 
night that their proposal calls for building 100 condominiums in three-story 
buildings at Torrance Boulevard and Cabrillo Avenue and 70 more at Cravens 
Avenue and El Prado. The units would range in price from $125,000 to $270,000. 
</P>
<P>
The project would eliminate landscaped center medians on several streets to 
convert the current parallel parking to a diagonal pattern and would raze two 
old hotels and the quarters of several local stores and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Gascon Mar representatives said they plan to conduct a series of public 
meetings on the proposal before filing formal plans with the city.

DAVE DISTEL: DOGS OF SUMMER; IF THEY ONLY HAD A HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is not the time of year for a baseball team deeply entrenched in the 
second division to be attracting any attention. Such a team usually plays out 
the string in a vacuum, with attention turned to more exciting things such as 
football and raking leaves. 
</P>
<P>
So it stunned me this week that the Padres rather than the Chargers were the 
hottest topics of conversation hereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
Little of it, indeed, had to do with the firing of Jack McKeon as general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Following a weekend in which the Chargers looked as impressive as they have at 
any time since maybe the Don Coryell days, a startling number of people 
approached me about the Padres' weekend series against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
With disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"That team," said a friend with season tickets, "has flat-out quit." 
</P>
<P>
He left after the first game of Saturday night's doubleheader . . . and did not 
return for Sunday's home finale. 
</P>
<P>
"And," he said, "I couldn't give the Sunday tickets away. No more season 
tickets for us. Probably not even a mini-package." 
</P>
<P>
And another . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Never," he said, "have I seen a baseball team dog it like the Padres did 
against Cincinnati. I don't know if I've seen any team dog it like that." 
</P>
<P>
And another . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I took my kids to the Sunday game," he said. "I've always told them the 
American way is to fight even when you're down. Those guys have quit. Watching 
them was more of an embarrassment than listening to Roseanne Barr . . . and at 
least Roseanne Barr was trying." 
</P>
<P>
That's embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
In case you missed it, the Padres played four games against the Cincinnati Reds 
over the weekend and lost, 10-1, 6-4, 9-5 and 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction to this lackadaisical performance was, in a word, outrage. That it 
came against a division leader trying to protect a less-than-comfortable 
advantage only magnified the intensity of this outrage. 
</P>
<P>
This displeasure was, to be sure, widespread. It was the kind of reaction you 
expect after an early-season disappointment, when a team is still in a pennant 
race. However, as poorly as the Padres have played all year, this performance 
drew more negative reaction than all of the ineptitude of this dismal summer. 
</P>
<P>
You see, fans can stand it when a team plays hard and loses. They complain, 
fans being fans. But they do not get so mad that they come unglued. 
</P>
<P>
On this weekend, those who follow the Padres -- they may, at this point, prefer 
not to be called Padre fans -- thought they were watching a team which had 
collectively tanked it. They were going through the motions . . . slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Calling to the witness stand Danny Jackson, Cincinnati's winning pitcher Sunday 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst day I've had since I've come back (from injury)," he said. "I 
had no idea where I was throwing the ball. I mean, I was just throwing the ball 
up there. I had nothing on it." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson seemed baffled that the Padres could not hit what he was offering, but 
he worked seven innings and allowed two runs and six hits. No one asked if he 
noticed whether any of the hitters had their eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine what the Dodgers must have been thinking in Los Angeles as they 
struggled to stay in contention. They had to be wondering if the Padres had 
shown up against the Reds, or just mailed in their strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
As Padre pitcher Dennis Rasmussen said: "We're going to catch hell from them 
when we see them again. And we should catch some, the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers may not be greatly loved hereabouts, but there is integrity to a 
pennant race, and the Padres played without integrity against Cincinnati. They 
also played without courage, intensity and togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, this series simply underscored the lack of character these 
underachievers have displayed all year. The Padres are the tin men of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
When Tom Werner hires a new general manager, tapes of this lost weekend should 
be mandatory viewing. Or maybe X-rays. It would be nice to be able to look 
inside these guys and see what, if anything, is there. 
</P>
<P>
In more than a quarter-century of covering sports, I have never seen a team 
fall as far short of expectations as these Padres have. This team has eroded 
and corroded from the inside out, bitterly battling one another more vigorously 
than it ever battled the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Two series now remain. Three games beginning Friday in Cincinnati and three 
games beginning Monday in Los Angeles. The Reds are probably licking their 
chops and the Dodgers frothing at the mouth, given what the tin men did to the 
possibility of a tight race over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't care to watch, don't feel bad. It doesn't seem these guys care to 
play.

CHARGERS' PHILLIPS BADLY BEATEN 
</P>

<P>
Joe Phillips, the Chargers' 6-foot-5, 315-pound starting nose tackle, was 
hospitalized after being severely beaten by three men early Wednesday when he 
left a Mission Beach restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lee Rice announced through a team spokesman that Phillips suffered a 
fractured nose, fractures to the eye orbit, a concussion and multiple bruises 
and abrasions. Rice said Phillips will undergo surgery to repair damage to his 
nose and eye orbit within the week. 
</P>
<P>
Police had earlier reported that Phillips also had skull fractures and three 
broken ribs, but the Charger spokesman said those reports were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known how long Phillips will be hospitalized, but Rice said he is not 
expected to return to practice for at least eight weeks. The Chargers placed 
Phillips on the reserve non-football injury list and signed safety Michael 
Brooks. The club has the option of not paying Phillips, but General Manager 
Bobby Beathard said, "The club never considered it. He will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"My God, it's tragic to have something like this happen," Beathard said. "From 
what I've been told, he got the living hell beat out of him." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, known for his tough-guy image, is considered the Chargers' strongest 
player. "Those guys must have been sneaky or tough," defensive line coach 
Gunther Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Charger defensive lineman Les Miller: "It's a big city, and it can happen 
to anybody. What can you say? You feel bad, you feel anger and you feel 
helpless. I hope they find out who did it. I know I'd like to find them." 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made, but police have interviewed at least three people 
who witnessed the incident, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. He declined 
comment on whether any suspects have been identified. The witnesses will be 
interviewed again today, police said, because of conflicting accounts. 
</P>
<P>
A motive has not been determined, but Phillips was not robbed, Robinson added. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Phillips, 27, was being treated in the intensive care unit of 
Sharp Memorial Hospital, but a hospital spokeswoman would not release his 
condition or even confirm that Phillips was there. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the attack occurred sometime after 1 a.m. when Phillips was walking 
to his car after leaving Saska's, a restaurant at 3768 Mission Blvd. A witness 
told a Times reporter the incident occured between 2:15 a.m. and 2:30 in 
Saska's parking lot, a block north of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was transported by ambulance to Mission Bay Hospital and later 
transferred to Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Phillips was accompanied by a woman at the time of the attack and 
that she was also assaulted. A Mission Bay hospital spokesman said no woman 
required medical treatment at the time Phillips was admitted. Police declined 
to identify the woman but said she was not Phillips' wife. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, who detailed Wednesday's incident for the Times but asked not to 
be identified, said a car pulled up and parked on the street next to where 
Phillips and the woman were walking. Several residents said the area has 
recently been plagued by crime. 
</P>
<P>
Words were exchanged between Phillips and the assailants, police said, and the 
assailants jumped Phillips. The three men, one wearing steel-toed boots, beat 
and kicked Phillips repeatedly, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The witness said that Phillips was knocked to the ground and that the woman was 
kicked repeatedly by one of the assailants. The witness said Phillips' T-shirt 
was ripped from his body. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the witness said, a second assailant smashed the windows on 
Phillips' car with his fist, and a third attacker chased after a man who was 
walking toward the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't big like him," the witness said. "They were small guys." 
</P>
<P>
After the assault, the witness said, the three men got into the car and drove 
off. The witness said Phillips got up shortly after and, with assistance from 
the woman, was able to walk to the ambulance, which arrived about five minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"There was just blood all over his face," the witness said. "It was not a 
pretty scene. It was pretty bad. He was pretty shaken up. The girl was really 
freaking out. It was gross." 
</P>
<P>
The witness said the woman screamed: "I can't believe you're hitting a girl, I 
can't believe you're hitting a girl." 
</P>
<P>
Police and the witness were unclear whether the assailants were armed or if 
Phillips was able to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Saska, a partial owner who of the restaurant who was not there at the time, 
said Phillips comes in about once a week. He said a bartender told him Phillips 
entered the restaurant after midnight and ordered food. 
</P>
<P>
Saska said Phillips called him from the hospital Wednesday, explained the 
incident and asked if Saska knew the assailants or had seen them before. Saska 
said he did not. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he got the . . . beat out of him," Saska said. "He sounded pretty 
upset. It doesn't make sense. I've worked at Saska's for 17 years, and 
nothing's ever happened like that around here." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips talked briefly with police Wednesday and is scheduled to be 
interviewed in more detail today. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not completed the investigation," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips spoke with Cunningham and defensive coordinator Ron Lynn. But his 
wife, Cynthia, told the media Phillips would be unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning told his players of Phillips' situation earlier Wednesday but 
said he was sketchy on details. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who has been attending law classes at the University of San Diego 
while playing football, joined the Chargers as a replacement player during the 
players' strike in 1987. He has started 38 of the past 45 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Les (Miller) will be the nose guard on first down, and George Hinkle will be 
the starter on third down," Cunningham said. "But Joe was having a great 
season; he was playing outstanding football. He's the life of the party 
so-to-speak -- that's the part I miss already."

LUGINBILL TAKES DEFENSE TO WOODSHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Aztec defense, already ranked last in the country, got a couple of 
scoldings from Coach Al Luginbill during practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have been better off if we had not even practiced today," an exasperated 
Luginbill said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it was. (Tuesday) we were flying around, and we made a few 
errors, but it was Tuesday. Wednesday we should be getting sharper, and we 
didn't. . . .

"We've got to come out of it by (Thursday). We've only got one more day. What 
we're doing is so simple, it's almost scary. I'm concerned about it, obviously, 
because we haven't done this before at this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill stopped practice about three-quarters of the way through to chew out 
the defense and then got after them again when practice was finished. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore defensive lineman Vaea Santos fractured his right foot during 
practice Wednesday and will undergo surgery today. Luginbill had already 
planned to redshirt him. Team physician Dr. Robert Straumfjord also examined 
running backs Tommy Booker (sprained ankle) and Curtis Butts (neck 
strain/sprain) and cleared both to practice today, according to head trainer 
Brian Barry. Both Booker and Butts are available for Saturday's game against 
Air Force. Freshman linebacker Jamal Duff (bruised thigh) was cleared to start 
running today. Offensive tackle Nick Subis (sprained right knee) and Carlson 
Leomiti (bruised foot) is probable. . . . Vickie Larsen, SDSU ticket manager, 
said she is expecting a crowd of about 20,000 Saturday. The game with Air 
Force, which begins an hour earlier than usual at 6:05 p.m., will feature a 
pre-game paper airplane throwing contest and a post-game concert by the group 
America as well as an appearance by the Famous Chicken.

FOSTER EARNING SPOTLIGHT FOR AZTECS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lights were never this bright at DeAnza Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Foster shifted his weight from one foot to the other underneath the stands 
at Cougar Stadium on the campus of Brigham Young University, surrounded by 
drab, gray concrete. Floors, walls, ceilings. All around him, concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium was practically deserted other than a dozen or so people. Voices 
echoed, then hushed. Foster waited. His teammate, Dan McGwire, was being 
interviewed by a couple of guys from CBS television as the network prepared to 
beam SDSU-BYU nationally the following day. 
</P>
<P>
The television lights seemed as if they were about two million watts. 
</P>
<P>
This was last Friday, and in another day, SDSU would play the No. 4 team in the 
country. And the TV guys had requested interviews with McGwire . . . and 
Foster. 
</P>
<P>
He stood alone. He worried that maybe he should be wearing his glasses rather 
than his contact lenses, for the Mike Singletary look. He wondered what he was 
going to say. A minute passed, and then another, and then the television crew 
signaled that they were ready. Lou Foster stepped forward, into the lights . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, he had played football in the relative obscurity of a community 
college program, DeAnza, just outside San Jose. He is a linebacker but stands 
just 5-feet-11 (he weighs 230 pounds). There isn't much of a demand for 
football players -- let alone linebackers -- at that height, so Foster ended up 
DeAnza after his years at Oak Grove High School in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
That's where he caught SDSU Coach Al Luginbill's attention. Foster was chosen 
second-team all-state last year, having averaged 17 tackles per game. He led 
DeAnza in tackling both years. 
</P>
<P>
Then he walked onto the SDSU campus last spring and promptly earned the 
starting middle linebacker job. 
</P>
<P>
Things were great for a while. He would be able to reach out and touch his 
dream, just as soon as the season started. Division I football. The big time. 
He would start. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled his right hamstring during conditioning drills in mid-August, a few 
days before SDSU began two-a-days. It took longer than expected to heal, and he 
missed the season opener at Oregon. Finally, he got in for a few plays Sept. 15 
against Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, here came BYU. And the television cameras. Someone had put his life on 
fast-forward, then turned the volume all the way up. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time anybody ever asked me to do a television interview 
concerning football," Foster said. "It was fun. I enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
He would have enjoyed it all a little bit more if the Cougars hadn't raked the 
Aztec defense for 62 points and 641 total yards. Foster had a decent game, but 
he missed a few assignments. Like the rest of the Aztec defense, he is 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
Defending against the run has been the strength of an SDSU defense that is 
ranked last in the country (106th) among NCAA Division I schools in total 
defense (an average of 509.7 yards allowed per game). The Aztecs have allowed 
101.3 yards a game on the ground, which puts them 21st in the country. Part of 
that credit has to go to Foster, despite the practice -- and game time -- he 
has missed. A year ago, the Aztecs gave up 181 yards a game rushing. 
</P>
<P>
It is the middle linebacker's responsibility in the SDSU defensive scheme to 
call out plays and lead pursuit. Foster caught on almost immediately last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The middle linebacker is an extremely important player in our defense," 
Luginbill said. "We free him up to make tackles, and we expect him to make 
tackles." 
</P>
<P>
And with the Air Force wishbone coming to town Saturday, Foster and the rest of 
the SDSU defense will get a chance to continue their improvement against the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm chomping my lips," Foster said. "We have an opportunity to show a lot 
of people we're very good against the run." 
</P>
<P>
The two things that give you the most insight into Lou Foster are these: 
</P>
<P>
* He is starting at middle linebacker for a Division I football team despite 
his height. 
</P>
<P>
* His teammates look up to him. 
</P>
<P>
Yes. There are jokes about his size, and this is where peanuts come in. 
</P>
<P>
"Our coaches tease us all the time about being small," said Foster's roommate 
and starting outside linebacker Andy Coviello, who is just 6-0, 215. "They 
tease us about how people can eat peanuts off the top of our heads." 
</P>
<P>
But that's about as far as the jokes go. When Foster wears his glasses, he 
looks like Singletary. He plays as if he knows what he is doing. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill has said several times that the Aztec defense had nobody as intense 
and fiesty as Foster last season. The thing about Lou Foster is that he loves 
to hit. 
</P>
<P>
Reporter: "What do you like best about football?" 
</P>
<P>
Foster: Pause. Smile. "I get to hit somebody and not get sent to jail for it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coviello: "I've seen him hit people 20 yards downfield for no reason, but 
the whistle hadn't blown yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen him not hyped. Certain people go through the motions. Lou, 
never. He leads by example." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, this leads to late nights for the roommates. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very serious," Coviello said. "We'll go home, and sometimes it's hard to 
get our homework done because we'll talk about different ways to hit. He loves 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, we've stayed up until one or two in the morning talking about, 
'Oh, man, I remember when I did this,' or, last week, 'I can't wait to hit Ty 
(Detmer).' This week, it's 'I can't wait to hit the Air Force fullbacks.' " 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is why the Aztecs took an instant liking to their new linebacker 
last spring. He's a physical nut on the field. He loves the game. And off the 
field, he's got an easy-going, friendly manner. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a much better defensive team when he's on the field," Luginbill 
said. "We don't have the same unification, we don't have the same overall unity 
we have when he's not on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. It's his personality. He draws on kids, and our kids will follow 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coviello: "I think everybody respects him for maybe this aura he has about 
him. There's something about Lou. When you look at him, he has a look on his 
face like he knows what's up. He means business and he's serious. We all kind 
of look up to him in a way." 
</P>
<P>
The hamstring, Foster said, is about 95% healthy. He played only about half of 
the BYU game and hopes to play more Saturday. Luginbill says Foster is still 
playing catch-up because of time missed with the injury. Still, Luginbill feels 
better when Foster is on the field, even if Foster makes mistakes from time to 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says he's too short to play," Luginbill said. "I think his belief in 
himself and his confidence in himself as a football player, and his pride in 
wanting to do what's right, is what's impressive about him. He's a very 
coachable kid, and he wants to do what's right helping the team win. He just 
exudes that all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Foster and Coviello arrived at the SDSU football offices to watch film 
and see where they went wrong against BYU. It was an off-day for the Aztecs, 
but they didn't want to wait until Monday to see what they needed to work on. 
</P>
<P>
Foster saw his problem clearly. From time to time, he wasn't "snugging" the BYU 
backs enough. In other words, he was a bit too far behind the line of 
scrimmage, allowing the BYU backs an extra couple of steps head start. One 
time, he saw where he could have gotten a sack had he been up a little closer. 
</P>
<P>
The films moved along, and Foster sat there in the darkness. There were no 
lights now, just the images flickering across the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
There was work to be done.

PASSING THROUGH CUSTOMS; 
</P>
<P>
CYPRIOT DANNY DANIELS HAS MASTERED SOCCER BUT NOT MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF 
AMERICAN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name change and the earring are immediate giveaways. Yes, Danny Daniels, 
a.k.a. Haratch Danielan, has adapted to American ways since his arrival in 
Northridge three years ago. But make no mistake, Daniels is a Cypriot at heart. 
</P>
<P>
A citizen of Cyprus, an island nation off the coasts of Turkey and Syria, 
Daniels comes from a world in which sons obey their fathers, even if it means 
putting off their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
At Vahram Danielan's insistence, his son came to America to pursue a college 
education. If not for Danielan's intervention, Daniels likely would be playing 
for a professional soccer team in Cyprus or Greece rather than scoring goals 
for Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a big argument with him," said Daniels, whose father could not afford a 
college education. "The only argument I've ever had with him in my whole life. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad said: 'No education?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'So what. My dream is not to make a million dollars. I want to have 
fun and make money to live.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then my dad said: 'What if you hurt your knee and your soccer career is over?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'I can die tomorrow. I want to have fun with soccer first. When it is 
over, there's a lot of things I can do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' determination to play was born of two experiences, those of his uncle 
and his teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"My uncle (Minas Danielan) played only two years in the pros," Daniels said. 
"When I asked him what happened, he never gave a reason." 
</P>
<P>
"My teacher, Mr. Hatchikos, was a goalie. He broke his leg. He's 42 now and he 
still says he should have gone back. He told me not to make the same mistake. 
He told me to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
But Daniels' father would not bend, so his son came to Southern California to 
live with older brothers Jack and Mark. Because he could not speak English, 
Danny could not gain admission to a university. After a year of practice, 
primarily with Jack's former mother-in-law, he learned enough of the language 
to be admitted to CSUN, where he immediately joined the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a nightmare understanding English," Daniels said. "Even in my own 
language (Cypriot) I'm not very good. I always tell the teachers from the 
beginning that English is my second language so you might find some silly 
mistakes in my papers." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Daniels' teammates chuckle when they recall the time he was pulled 
over by a police officer while carting them around town. 
</P>
<P>
"The cop asked for my papers and I told her: " 'Well, I just shampooed my 
car'," Daniels said. "She thought I was drunk. What I was trying to tell her 
was that I took the registration out when I washed my car." 
</P>
<P>
The language adjustment is one of many Daniels has made. He says he still 
doesn't understand America's work ethic, although his schedule -- school, 
soccer and a job as a waiter -- appears to emulate it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here, I was shocked," Daniels said. "All people do is work, work, 
work. There's too much pressure. I'm not used to that. 
</P>
<P>
"For people over here it's gotta be Friday or Saturday to have a crazy day. 
Over there (Cyprus) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, whenever you want to party, you 
party. If you don't go to work one day, no big deal. If you can't make it, you 
can't make it." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' manners also have required an alteration. 
</P>
<P>
"The customers in the restaurant say, 'Don't call me sir'," Daniels said. "I 
say, 'What do you want me to say, 'Hey, fella'?" 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Daniels is outgoing as well as polite. It has served him well as a 
stranger in a strange land. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls I have no problem with, but the way they behave I am not used to," he 
said. "I am a jealous guy and they hug other guys. And they say anything they 
want. Personal stuff. It is kind of embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, a sophomore, has less difficulty relating to his teammates, but he 
does not openly share his pro aspirations with them for fear of appearing to be 
a braggart. 
</P>
<P>
Where he comes from, it is de rigueur -- skilled players turn pro right out of 
high school, and, in some cases, during high school. By the time Daniels, 20, 
leaves CSUN he will be middle-aged, in terms of a Cypriot or Greek pro soccer 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that disadvantage, Daniels hopes to catch on with a pro team after 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my dream: To play soccer and get paid for it," he said. "I still have 
time. It all depends on me.' 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Daniels is showing that he can play the U. S. game. 
</P>
<P>
In only his second match of the season, Daniels scored the tying goal in 
overtime against 19th-ranked Washington. A week later, he tallied both goals in 
a 2-0 victory over Southern California College. Despite missing 3 1/2 games 
because of a strained Achilles' tendon that continues to pain him and requires 
daily treatments, he is tied with Steve Linhart for the team scoring lead with 
eight points. 
</P>
<P>
"When I play soccer I forget everything," Daniels said. "No matter how 
frustrating the game, I don't get peeved. I have fun." 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, soccer set Daniels apart from a family that had difficulty 
staying together. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' two brothers and their sister, Mary, were born in their father's 
native Italy. But he and another brother, Heros (Harry), were born in Kuwait 
while his father was there doing business as a clothing salesman. 
</P>
<P>
Until their late teens, Danny and Harry didn't know their older brothers, who 
were in school in Italy. For several years their father also lived part of the 
time in Italy because that's where his business took him. 
</P>
<P>
Although Danny's mother, Mary, traveled to Italy with her children for visits, 
Danny missed many of those trips because of tournaments in Switzerland, Austria 
and Egypt as soccer became more and more important to him. During one stretch, 
he was away from his family for six months. That experience helped prepare him 
for the move to the United States, but there were still adjustments to be made. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is different," Daniels said. "I knew I would see my mom in a few 
months, but I know now I won't see her for several years." 
</P>
<P>
His parents phone as often as they can, however. 
</P>
<P>
"When my dad calls, all he wants to hear about is school," Daniels said. "I 
tell him 'School is fine. Come over here and see one of my matches.' " 
</P>
<P>
While Mary attended most of Daniels' matches in Cyprus, Vahram has seen his son 
play only twice -- many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Danny would like nothing better than to have them in the stands at CSUN. Of 
course if they come to the United States to visit, Daniels will be minus one 
accessory: In deference to his father, he won't be wearing the earring.

PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;

CHARGERS; 
</P>
<P>
PATTEN SCHEDULED TO RETURN TO PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers' beleaguered offensive line is expected to receive a jolt of good 
news next week. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Joel Patten, who missed training camp and who has been unable to play 
for the Chargers to date, will return to practice Monday and should be able to 
play against Pittsburgh Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Patten was the team's starting left tackle last season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the plan," Gary Losse, the Chargers' team physician, said Wednesday. 
"He's doing fine. He could fall down a flight of stairs or something, but if 
all goes well, we hope to have him playing against Pittsburgh." 
</P>
<P>
Patten underwent arthroscopic knee surgery shortly before training camp and was 
placed on injured reserve when the regular season opened. 
</P>
<P>
"He's right on schedule," Losse said. "He had to get the strength back, and 
there was no pain. He began running, and there was some pain, and we backed 
off. But now he's running again with no pain and essentially he can do 
everything now without problem." 
</P>
<P>
Patten is not eligible to come off injured reserve until Monday, and if he 
does, the club will have to remove a player from its 47-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours after learning of nose tackle Joe Phillips' unfortunate situation, 
the team gave a tryout to 6-3, 300-pound defensive lineman Tony Savage, who had 
been with the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Starting safety Vencie Glenn, who is recovering from a concussion and sore 
neck, did not practice Wednesday, and was listed as questionable for Sunday's 
game with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't know if I'm going to play Sunday," Glenn said. "I'll make that decision 
when the times comes. I will make it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be back. I'm not saying it's this game, but I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said the team may consider placing the safety on injured 
reserve, thereby losing him for four weeks, if Glenn continues to be bothered 
by his sore neck. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any danger medically, but he's had trauma to the neck 
and he's had headaches," Henning said. "Somewhere along the line Vencie and I 
will sit down and make the decision that's best for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's ready to play Sunday then we're OK. If he doesn't we'll have to 
discuss the possibility of resting him more than just the week. We can take the 
possibility of putting him down (on injured reserve) and letting him have it 
checked periodically for a couple of weeks, and strengthen it and go from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The club announced it had re-signed safety Michael Brooks, who had been 
released at the end of training camp. Brooks fills Phillips' vacant roster spot 
and demonstrates the team's concern with Glenn's status.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
MOORPARK'S PASSING: A LITTLE MEANS A LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throwing the ball is little more than a passing fancy for the run-oriented 
Moorpark College football team, but the Raiders have nonetheless done some 
fancy passing this season. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, with five touchdown passes, has more than any of the other five 
Valley-area junior college teams -- this despite the fact that it has passed 
only 27 times. 
</P>
<P>
The five other schools have combined for nine passing touchdowns in 301 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"People get excited about stopping our running game, and, jeez, we just get 
people wide open," Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said. "It's like they (Moorpark 
receivers) just run right by them." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Del Marine and Antelope Valley's Marty Washington are tied for the 
area lead in touchdown passes with three each. However Washington has thrown 71 
passes and Marine has thrown four. 
</P>
<P>
Mighty mite: Jason Ferguson, Northridge's senior fullback, played, in Coach Bob 
Burt's estimation, "the best game he's had since he's been here" in helping the 
Matadors defeat Central (Okla.) State, 17-6, last Saturday. He gained 35 yards 
in five carries and caught two passes for 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Decent statistics but seemingly not enough to draw such praise. 
</P>
<P>
But it should be noted that much of Ferguson's work showed up in the statistics 
of his running mate -- tailback Albert Fann. Fann scored twice and surpassed 
100 yards rushing for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
"If our fullback has a good game, our tailback is going to have a good game," 
Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's work on Keith Traylor, Central State's 6-foot-3, 253-pound 
All-American inside linebacker, especially impressed Burt. "He flat buckled him 
-- knocked the hell out of him a couple of times," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is 5-9, 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Break time: The Cal State Northridge men's and women's cross-country teams will 
be without their No. 1 runners when they compete in the Riverside Invitational 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Derik Vett and Darcy Arreola, the Matadors' top runners in the Fresno and Aztec 
invitationals, will not run at Riverside in order to concentrate on training. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of their experience and condition, they don't need to race as often as 
some of the others," Coach Don Strametz said. "So we'll just use this week to 
concentrate on training. Instead of running two hard workouts during the week 
and racing on Saturday, they'll be able to run three hard workouts." 
</P>
<P>
The best medicine: Despite the tribulations of an 0-3 start, Cal Lutheran 
football Coach Joe Harper has not lost his sense of humor. If anything, he is 
becoming more relaxed as he settles into the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players after the last ballgame that sometimes you've just got to 
stand back and laugh at some of the things that happen in a ballgame," Harper 
said of a 34-12 loss to St. Mary's. "It's just so unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
The bare facts: If you're trying to pinpoint the reasons for the Valley 
football team's dismal start, you don't have to look any further than the 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, who have been outscored, 91-28, rank last in the Western State 
Conference in team offense (212.5 yards a game) and defense (464 average). 
</P>
<P>
Valley's ground attack has really sputtered, gaining 75 yards in two games. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Valley averaged 193.5 yards rushing during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a ranking: The Cal State Northridge women's volleyball team is 
aiming to break into the West Regional top 10 rankings, one of four regional 
polls compiled weekly by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
A regional ranking can improve a team's chances for postseason play. And 
although Coach Walt Ker has not given up on the NCAA championships, it might be 
too much to expect his 10-5 Matadors to receive a berth in the 32-team 
tournament in their first year at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
That could leave Northridge in the "NIT" of women's volleyball, the 20-team 
Women's Intercollegiate Volleyball championships, Nov. 29-Dec. 1 at the 
University of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Stingy Marauders: Antelope Valley is ranked third in the Foothill Conference in 
total defense, giving up 228.7 yards a game, yet the Marauders lead the 
conference in scoring defense with 15 points allowed in three games. 
</P>
<P>
They have posted consecutive shutouts and have not been scored on since the 
third quarter of a season-opening, 22-15 victory against San Diego City 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Balance has been the key to Antelope Valley's defense. 
</P>
<P>
In the game against San Diego, defensive lineman Daren Rodgers led the team 
with eight unassisted tackles. Linebacker Jason Metry had a team-high seven 
unassisted tackles against Kings River and defensive back Charley Wright led 
the team with eight against Victor Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Football shorts: Former Simi Valley High and Valley College quarterback Todd 
Studer completed 18 of 29 passes for 296 yards and three touchdowns in Cal 
State Long Beach's 28-7 win against Pacific last Saturday. Teammate Sean 
Cheevers, formerly of Moorpark College, kicked all four extra points in the 
49ers' first win of the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two other quarterbacks from the area posted big numbers over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills High product Jeremy Leach threw for 349 yards in New Mexico's 
34-32 loss to Texas Tech. Just a junior, Leach ranks 10th in the Western 
Athletic Conference in career passing yardage with 6,780. 
</P>
<P>
He is on pace to break the WAC career record of 11,4254 yards held by San Diego 
State's Todd Santos, but so is Brigham Young's Ty Detmer, also a junior, who is 
seventh with 7,567 yards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Brad Gossen, a former Westlake High quarterback, ran nine times for 44 yards -- 
including a 17-yard touchdown run -- and completed 21 of 27 for 238 yards and 
two touchdowns in Washington State's 41-31 triumph over Cal. Teammate Rich 
Swinton, a former standout at Montclair Prep, gained 55 yards in seven carries. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
In Washington's 31-0 win over USC, sophomore strong safety Tommie Smith, 
formerly of Antelope Valley High, intercepted his second pass of the season and 
returned it 14 yards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In other games involving former Valley-area players: Sean Burwell (Cleveland 
High) ran for 77 yards in 19 carries in Oregon's 22-17 loss to Arizona; J. J. 
Lasley (Crespi High) gained 38 yards in four carries in Stanford's 37-3 win 
over Oregon St.; and Damond Hogan (Reseda High and Valley College) caught two 
passes for 14 yards in Cal State Fullerton's 48-17 loss to Akron. 
</P>
<P>
Getting their kicks: The Occidental College women's soccer team set four school 
records in a 14-0 win over La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Jos Bergmann scored five goals -- the first after 52 seconds -- and had three 
assists to set school records for most goals in a match, quickest goal at the 
start of the match and most points (13) in a match. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 goals are also an Occidental record. 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: Cal State Northridge's defense is eighth best in the nation against 
the run, according to Division II statistics released this week by the NCAA. 
The Matadors allow an average of 71 rushing yards a game. . . . CSUN linebacker 
Mario Hull leads Western Football Conference players with three interceptions. 
. . . Santa Clara's Chris Hite, a former Hart High standout, is tied for second 
in the WFC with 15 pass receptions.

Occidental Coach Bill Harvey is wary of crediting one athlete for the success 
of this year's team, but it is difficult not to notice the Tigers' No. 1 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
Beltran, a junior transfer from Fullerton Junior College, led Occidental to a 
seventh-place finish in the Fresno Invitational on Sept. 15 and helped the 
Tigers to a convincing double-dual meet victory over Redlands and Pomona-Pitzer 
last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He finished ninth in Fresno against a field of predominantly Division I runners 
and smashed the five-mile course record at Redlands with a time of 26 minutes 
59.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's certainly a very good runner and very experienced," Harvey said of 
Beltran, a native of Mexico and the national junior college record-holder in 
the marathon (2:17:26). "But there's a lot more to his life than running. He's 
a very fine student and a highly motivated one. 
</P>
<P>
"School's going to come first with him no matter how he runs."

FURNISHINGS 2000 CITES REASON FOR SHUTDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Furnishings 2000, which earlier this month entered bankruptcy proceedings and 
closed all of its 37 stores in California, announced Wednesday that a shortage 
of funds had forced it to "cease operations." 
</P>
<P>
Company executives did not return telephone calls, but in a prepared statement, 
a Furnishings 2000 spokesman said that it has filed a motion with a U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court judge in New York City that would require the company's 
secured creditor, "which has a security interest in all of the company's 
inventory, to remove the inventory collateral from the company's stores and 
warehouses and to pay rent until the inventory is removed." 
</P>
<P>
In the prepared statement, Furnishings 2000 spokesman Dan Morris said that the 
company has "only an outside chance" of arranging financing needed to operate 
its stores. Without alternate financing, the company "anticipates that proceeds 
from the sale of its store leases and other assets will be insufficient to pay 
all creditor claims in full," Morris said. "In that event, no distribution will 
be available to stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
Furnishings 2000, which was a San Diego-based company when it completed its 
initial public offering in 1983, since has moved its corporate headquarters to 
Mira Loma. The company has reported only a handful of profitable quarters since 
its initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, GF Holdings, a privately held, New York-based company, acquired 67% 
of Furnishing 2000's shares. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which operated 37 stores in California, has five stores in San 
Diego County. Employees at those stores have been furloughed, a company 
spokesman said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Furnishings 2000 customers with complaints or questions have been directed to 
contact the clerk of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland at the Southern 
District of New York in New York City.

SOCIETY: ABBY'S ANSWER SHORT, SWEET AT HOSPICE TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Abigail Van Buren -- or Dear Abby, if you prefer -- is one of the few 
recognized authorities who can offer precise, step-by-step instructions on how 
to respond when wife-to-be No. 3 announces that your first two wives have 
agreed to be her co-matrons of honor. 
</P>
<P>
No wicket is too sticky for Dear Abby, no situation too outlandish to inspire 
even a modicum of written reticence on her part -- which made it all the more 
surprising that at the Saturday fund-raiser at which San Diego Hospice 
presented Van Buren its 1990 Humanitarian of the Year award, Abby was nearly 
speechless. 
</P>
<P>
The hospice annually provides health care and counseling services to about 
1,000 patients facing life-threating illnesses. The patient's families are also 
aided. At the dinner, it was announced that the 24-bed San Diego Hospice Center 
on Vauclain Point will open Feb. 14, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Van Buren, who attended the dinner-dance at the La Jolla Marriott with her 
husband, Morton Phillips, and hospice primary benefactor Joan Kroc, may have 
concluded that brevity is the soul of wit after joining the attendance of 750 
in listening to a roster of speakers who took the term testimonial dinner at 
full face value. 
</P>
<P>
Testimonials flew about the ballroom until the air seemed ready to rain them on 
the heads of Van Buren, Kroc, the committee, the several dozen table sponsors 
and dinner chairmen Jenny and Sid Craig, who were widely credited for the 
evening's record net proceeds of more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
During breaks between the bouts of speechifying, guests found time to wave 
forks at the chicken dinner, shake legs to the Wayne Foster Orchestra and watch 
a videotaped tribute to Van Buren that included remarks by her sister and 
fellow advice columnist, Ann Landers. 
</P>
<P>
Recognized by San Diego Hospice President Holly Lorentson as a quiet but 
longstanding and notably generous benefactor, Van Buren approached the podium 
to accept the humanitarian award after listening to Kroc's description of her 
as one who "helps those who are hurting." 
</P>
<P>
"Abby holds America's hands, and sometimes she slaps us across the wrist when 
we need it," said Kroc. "She makes us think, she makes us hope." 
</P>
<P>
Van Buren evidently discarded whatever acceptance speech she may have written 
because her impromptu remarks were freshly inspired by table mate Mercedes 
McCambridge, San Diego's Academy Award-winning actress. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercedes McCambridge said to me, 'You have been canonized tonight. So has been 
Joan Kroc -- she is Joan of Arc and you are Westminster 'Abby,' "' Van Buren 
reported, adding: "You are truly beautiful people. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
And that was that. 
</P>
<P>
The evening started at 6 p.m. with a VIP reception at which Van Buren, wearing 
a wide collar of pearls and diamonds and a simple but chic black sheath, spent 
the first half-hour obliging a corps of tireless photographers. The attendance 
was rich in notables, including author and hospice foundation board member 
Norman Cousins and his wife, Ellen, and Palm Springs society decorator Steve 
Chase, whose client list includes Kroc. 
</P>
<P>
Sid and Jenny Craig formally received the guests and said they became involved 
with San Diego Hospice after attending the 1989 testimonial dinner, at which 
retired U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was granted the humanitarian 
award. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so impressed by the event and by the people honored that we had to 
become involved," said Jenny Craig. "Once we saw the level of commitment at 
which these people at hospice work to get things done, we became emotionally 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Kroc, whose multimillion-dollar gift underwrote the construction of the hospice 
center, also shared in the evening's lavish distribution of praise. 
</P>
<P>
"The formal opening ceremonies for the center appropriately will be on 
Valentine's Day, and Joan Kroc made it all possible," Jenny Craig said to 
fervent applause. "As a woman, I am extremely proud of Joan Kroc because she 
has risen to the role she plays in business today without a lot of role models 
to guide her. The young women of San Diego today are fortunate to have Joan as 
their role model." 
</P>
<P>
Banker and dinner treasurer Bob Adelizzi and his wife, Tommi, headed a guest 
list that included Linda Smith, Freddie and Robert Driver, Sue and Charles 
Edwards, Sally and John Thornton, Julie and Mark LeDoux, Luba Johnston, Cecil 
Green, Karen and Jonathan McIntyre, Charles Feurzeig, Marge and Paul Palmer, 
Audrey Geisel, Emily Peagler and Mike O'Hara, Betsy and Doug Manchester, Junko 
and Larry Cushman, Marie and Dean Dunphy, Katy and Mike Dessent and Penny and 
Mike Wilkes. 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO SANTA FE -- In this bucolic community, the arrival of Labor Day 
announces not only autumn's approach but the imminent re-enactment of a one-day 
siege that for 36 years has seen 2,000 women and a few men descend upon the 
lawns of the Inn at Rancho Santa Fe for an afternoon of energetic box-lunching 
and fashion-watching. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the annual "Appearance of Autumn" event -- sponsored by the 
countywide The Country Friends philanthropic organization and consistently the 
largest outdoor fashion show staged in the United States -- washed over Rancho 
Santa Fe on Sept. 18. In its wake, it left 10 proud couples and net earnings of 
more than $50,000. The proceeds will be combined with other Country Friends 
funds and divided among numerous social service agencies, including the 
Alzheimer Family Center, the Home of Guiding Hands, Vista Community Center and 
Lifeline Community Services of North San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom department store presented a show titled "Fall by Design," which 
included fashions by such top designers as Missoni, Louis Feraud, Donna Karan 
and Giorgio Armani. 
</P>
<P>
Country Friends President Jean Newman called it "just dumb luck" that the day 
followed the breezy pattern nature normally grants the event, but the tradition 
continued, and as always the eucalyptus leaves cast paisley patterns over the 
women seated on each side of the lengthy runway. 
</P>
<P>
An opening segment traditionally honors noted volunteers and philanthropists; 
chairman Bess Lambron amended that tradition to honor couples instead. By 
chance, most of the men wore blue suits, while Nordstrom outfitted their wives. 
Betty and Alex DeBakcsy were first down the ramp, followed by Martha and George 
Gafford, Alison and George Gildred, Alyson and George Goudy, Ingrid and Joe 
Hibben, Virginia and Jack Monday, Rita and Josiah Neeper, Shirley (who died the 
next Sunday after a 14-year battle against cancer) and David Rubel, Elsie and 
Frank Weston and Betty and Burnet F. Wohlford. 
</P>
<P>
Key members among the sizable committee were Mili Atchison, Laurie Peters, 
Marilyn Dailey, Lynn Adkison, Flo Bible, La Verne Briggs, Nan Werner, Jeanne 
McMullin, Pat Irvine, Peggy Matthews, Mary Ann Fitch, Valerie Weaver and Pat 
Wood.

ARCHITECTURE: ESCONDIDO BUILDING ON A GOOD IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Escondido is rapidly becoming an architectural success story. A striking new 
City Hall designed by Pacific Associates Planners and Architects of San Diego 
opened two years ago, the result of a city-run, open-design competition. 
</P>
<P>
The city subsequently selected internationally known architects Moore Ruble 
Yudell to design a companion performing arts complex. Construction will start 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Associate's City Hall set the stage for several new downtown buildings, 
and many of them take their design cues from it. When the county project 
managers hired civil engineers Pountney and Associates and San Diego architect 
Rob Quigley to design a new transit complex downtown, for example, they 
specifically requested a building that would complement the city hall. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting $12.5-million Escondido Transit Center, which opened in February, 
pays direct homage. Quigley borrowed a simple ziggurat pattern and applied this 
unifying motif to monumental concrete towers, paving, decorative grille work 
and signs. Located at Valley Parkway and Quince Street, the project anchors its 
key downtown corner with the same romantic spirit as the City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Known for such idiosyncratic buildings as the Linda Vista Library and his own 
downtown San Diego office and residence on Cedar Street, Quigley's work has 
never been so influenced by another building. He freely acknowledges the debt. 
</P>
<P>
"The big picture is that Escondido didn't have a coherent identity," he said of 
this city of 104,000, which years ago left behind its image as a sleepy 
agricultural town. "There were a thousand different buildings, all going in 
different directions architecturally. That doesn't make for a community. I 
thought it was wonderful the way the City Hall set a direction and theme. I 
wanted to make sure the transit center played its part and contributed in a 
positive way to the formation of an identity." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Associate's City Hall is equal parts Irving Gill, 1930s Deco and Balboa 
Park. It has Gill's smooth, mission-influenced stucco walls, Deco-era grille 
work and decoration, and is anchored by an open lathe dome reminiscent of the 
botanical building in Balboa Park. A series of courtyards serves as an outdoor 
lobby to the interior spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley's transit center also celebrates this region's warm climate with its 
outdoor "waiting rooms." Concrete benches are placed beneath the open-air 
concrete atrium and three clock towers which tie the project together. Other 
bus stop benches are shaded by trees or steel-and-Lexan plastic awnings. Even 
the ticket office in one of three low concrete buildings is open-air. 
</P>
<P>
All of the structures are made of precast concrete panels that were poured on 
site, tilted into place by crane and bolted together. The largest ones are 36 
feet tall and weigh 40 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Trellis-shaded pedestrian paths fan out from the atrium to parking lots at the 
edges of the complex. Strung along these paths, the towers, with their tall, 
graceful, arched openings, beckon travelers in from the lots. The low buildings 
house ticket and transit offices and, eventually, will include a fast-food 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley said the budget didn't allow much extravagance with materials. Tilt-up 
concrete is an economical but often plain construction method usually reserved 
for industrial buildings, but Quigley found ways to dress it up for this public 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Simple decorative ziggurat patterns were cast right into the concrete. More 
expensive materials such as granite, brick, colorful tiles and copper gutters 
were used sparingly to add decoration. Paving tiles made from tire rubber add 
an unusual flair while serving as an apt transportation metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
Pountney and Associates gets credit for the project's layout and efficient 
circulation scheme. In the name of smooth operation, cars and buses take 
separate routes through the site. North County Transit District and Greyhound 
buses travel a peanut-shaped loop past 15 curbside stops. Cars have their own 
well-marked driveways leading to parking lots at the back. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape architect Marian Marum saved several towering eucalyptus trees that 
shade the lots and soften the visual impact of so much asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
The project even includes a decent piece of public art, the result of San Diego 
County's and the City of Escondido's policies requiring public art in new 
buildings. Peter Mitten's "Hekkilk" consists of large slabs of concrete in 
earthy tans, oranges and browns, fractured and tilted as if they had slammed 
together. A plaque nearby says Mitten meant to create "a big dent as in a pass 
through mountains," sort of an abstract variation on the way the concrete 
transit complex serves as a "pass" to new destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Along with all the plusses, the Escondido Transit Center has shortcomings. A 
lack of decoration at the bases of the clock towers makes them unappealing 
close up. Window-like openings in the towers let daylight inside and allow 
police enough views to make sure nothing illegal is going on, but these 
openings are too small and crude, and look like they were hacked into the 
concrete at the last minute. Given the otherwise inviting appearance of the 
center, the reflective glass on the main administration and ticket building 
seems unnecessarily cold. 
</P>
<P>
Transit centers are becoming increasingly important in urban areas. With all 
the movement of people and vehicles, they provide a kinetic design challenge, 
one which Quigley and Pountney have met with great success in Escondido. Other 
local cities hope to reduce car travel by providing bus and rail alternatives, 
and several new transit centers are being planned. Quigley is working on one 
for Solana Beach, while Pountney is designing another for Encinitas in 
conjunction with San Diego architect C.W. Kim. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN BRIEFS: Rob Quigley has completed the design of a house in Telluride, 
Colo., for movie director Oliver Stone. Quigley said the 8,500-square-foot home 
is his first "big budget" house, with an estimated price tag of $1.5 million. 
He said he is also working on the design of a $10-million Egyptian-flavored 
mixed-use project to be built at Park Boulevard and University Avenue. . . .

paths, left. "In the Realm of Ideas," the summer-long Frank Lloyd Wright 
exhibit in Balboa Park, closes Sunday. As of last Sunday, 151,000 had seen the 
show since it opened in June. DAVE GATLEY / Los Angeles Times

MOSQUE IS AN ANSWER TO THEIR PRAYERS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSLIMS: PLANS FOR A PERMANENT HOME HAVE BEEN OKD FOR VALLEY FOLLOWERS OF 
ISLAM, WHO NOW WORSHIP AT A CATHOLIC HALL AND THE NORTHRIDGE ISLAMIC CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Finished with Friday afternoon prayers, the Muslims filed out of the Knights of 
Columbus hall in Canoga Park. Pictures of past Knights presidents decorated the 
walls, along with plaques and flyers. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to come here," Mohammed Mohiuddin, president of the Islamic Center in 
Northridge, said about the hall that has served as his religion's temporary 
house of worship for the last two years. "We know we don't belong here. We're 
praying in a rented hall." 
</P>
<P>
Not for much longer. In 1991, the Muslim community in the San Fernando Valley 
-- an estimated 6,000 people -- will move into a new $1.8-million mosque on a 
2.5-acre site in Granada Hills recently approved by the Los Angeles City 
Council. Its significance to the Valley's followers of Islam is already 
apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first came here," said Amina Mulla, of Northridge, who emigrated from 
India in 1970, "we went around all L.A. to people's homes, and now we will all 
be together in one place, our own." 
</P>
<P>
Like Mulla, much of the Islamic community arrived in Southern California in the 
1960s and 1970s in pursuit of better education and opportunity. Today, they 
occupy middle-class jobs in the worlds of business, medicine and education; 
many are highly skilled engineers. But it would be presumptuous to stereotype 
Muslims. They come from all countries of the globe, and are scattered 
throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Muslims do not live in ghettos," Mohiuddin said. "We are in Canoga Park, and 
Sepulveda, Van Nuys and Granada Hills." 
</P>
<P>
What binds them together is their allegiance to Allah, his messenger on earth, 
Muhammad, and the rules and regulations that comprise their faith. They believe 
in complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol, and oppose premarital sex. They 
maintain public modesty; women are encouraged not to show their hair or legs, 
although they have the option. Mulla chooses to leave her hair uncovered, 
although many Muslim women do keep it hidden. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to see our women go out into the world half-naked," Mohiuddin 
said. "We have no such thing as dating, holding hands, this kind of nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
During prayers, held five times daily for about five minutes at a time, men and 
women are segregated. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Muslims insist women receive a lot of respect in the family, and in the 
community. "The Koran teaches men they must respect women," said Salam 
Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles. 
"Women run the family, and many have regular jobs." Mulla, for example, is a 
licensed medical technologist. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, while maintaining their connection to Islam, Muslims 
assimilate deeply into American culture. Of the estimated 4 million to 6 
million Muslims living in the United States, Al-Marayati said, about 750,000 
reside in California. And they proudly boast their credentials as United States 
citizens. Mohiuddin said: "We teach them to become good citizens here. This is 
a great country." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, their first loyalty is to Islam. "If you try to be 
better Muslims," said Saadiq Saafir, a Muslim messenger, or iman, from Los 
Angeles, at a recent Friday prayer service, "you'll be better Americans, but if 
you try to just be better Americans, you may not be better Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Muslims believe America, for all its religious freedom and 
openness, needs their spiritual guidance. "It's a far better place to live," 
said Hassan Khan, a volunteer at the Northridge center who came from Pakistan, 
"but that doesn't mean it can't be cleaned up." Khan referred specifically to 
rampant drug abuse and lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mohiuddin, Americans stick to negative myths about Muslims, 
mistaking all of them for Arabs. It's true millions of Muslims come from the 
Arab world, with Mecca in Saudi Arabia as the religion's holiest shrine, but as 
Mohiuddin told worshipers recently: "We are not the same people on television 
seen hijacking planes and terrorizing people." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in a statement from the Muslim Public Affairs Council, the Iraqi 
invasion was criticized. "We condemn the abuse of the name of Islam to justify 
actions by the rulers of the region," it said, although adding "we oppose 
foreign military build-up of the gulf and call for U.S. withdrawal from the 
region, to be replaced by a peacekeeping force, since human blood is more 
valuable than oil." 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the mosque is a long-delayed triumph for Mohiuddin. For 12 years, 
he has been trying to find a permanent house of worship for followers in the 
San Fernando Valley. At first, a Muslim offered his nursery school in Sepulveda 
for prayer services and Islamic education classes. But, as the number of 
Muslims swelled, that space became too small. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1980, the community got approval for the Islamic Center in Northridge, 
which, along with the Knights of Columbus hall, they have since used. 
</P>
<P>
But their need for more room kept growing. Frequently, during the Eid prayer, 
the feast held after a month of fasting, there wouldn't be enough parking space 
at the small Northridge facility. And on Fridays, afternoon prayer has to be 
split between the center and the Canoga Park hall. "The whole point," said 
Ahmed Elgabalawy, a center volunteer from Egypt, "is to get everyone together 
in one place." Typically, about 200 gather at the hall, with several dozen at 
the Northridge center. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 community members pay $50 annual dues; donations are also routinely 
collected after prayer. Youth education classes in Islam are held for two hours 
each Sunday, and organizers hope to expand them to afternoons during the week. 
Community members socialize a lot with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend most of our time with other Muslims in the Valley," Mulla said. 
</P>
<P>
Mohiuddin said the $1.8 million required for the new mosque will be collected 
during community fund-raising drives. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the mosque, the Los Angeles City Council required Spanish-style 
architecture, forcing the Muslims to forgo the traditional domes and minarets. 
The congregation's lobbyist, Robert Wilkinson, attributed the council's 
decision to prejudice, and members, while excited about the new home, aren't 
completely satisfied, either. "It would be better if we could do whatever we 
want," said Joseph Qadamani, a Palestinian who arrived in California 11 years 
ago. "We want people driving by to see it." 
</P>
<P>
There is hope. Mayor Tom Bradley criticized the council for placing the 
architecture restrictions, and left open the possibility the city might permit 
a dome and minaret. 
</P>
<P>
"But domes and minarets aren't the issue," Mohiuddin said. "We are here to 
stay, and now we have a place."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO;

<P>
ACOUSTIC JAZZ PIANIST PUTS FUN AND INTENSITY IN MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pianist Michel Camilo prefers playing acoustic jazz, like the great beboppers 
he looks up to, but he doesn't see his music as old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to portray the energy and passion of our times. It's very important 
that my music sounds like music of the '90s," said the Dominican-born Camilo, 
who opened five nights at Elario's on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Camilo has lived in New York for 11 years and says the urban experience infuses 
his music with a certain intensity, also a degree of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I think jazz should be fun, not just philosophical or cerebral. When I think 
of jazz, I think of the great smiles of Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Santo Domingo, Camilo was schooled as a classical pianist and 
became the youngest member of his country's national symphony orchestra at 16. 
But by then, he was already heading in other directions. 
</P>
<P>
"They had two jazz shows on the radio when I was growing up, and I first heard 
them when I was 14," Camilo said. "When I heard Art Tatum, that changed my 
life. Up to that point, I thought that to play the instrument fully and with 
spirit, you had to play classical music. Then all of a sudden, I hear this man 
playing with an incredible feeling, rich harmonies and amazing control. 
Immediately that attuned me to jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Camilo's percussive attack has often been compared to that of pianist McCoy 
Tyner, the former John Coltrane sideman whom Camilo listened to growing up. But 
he names pianists Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and Bill Evans 
as additional influences -- he was especially taken with Evans' harmonic 
structures, "which really come from classical music," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Camilo has released two albums in Japan and three in the United States, 
including the new "On the Other Hand." His first two U.S. projects both hit No. 
1 on several jazz charts, and the newest has already become a favorite of 
mainstream jazz radio stations. Camilo's music also gets airtime on light jazz 
radio, he said, although his music isn't in the lineup at KIFM (98.1) in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Camilo is appearing with bassist Michael Bowie, who has worked 
with Dexter Gordon and Betty Carter, and young drummer Cliff Almond, 22, a 
former San Diegan. 
</P>
<P>
Just when you think you've got Brazilian guitarist Ricardo Silveira nailed 
down, he throws another curve. "Amazon Secrets," his new album, has something 
for everyone, from the Brazillian-sounding tropical title track, to upbeat 
music with a funky bass backbeat, to sections which evoke a gamut of great 
guitar memories from Wes Montgomery to Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
Silveira, who splits his time between Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro, appears 
at 2 p.m. Saturday as part of the "Chula Vista Harbor Days Festival and Tall 
Ship Parade" at the Chula Vista Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill is saxophonist Ronnie Laws, whose eighth solo album, "True 
Spirit," has just been released. Laws, who takes the stage at 3, didn't fare 
well the last time he was booked into San Diego. His scheduled 1989 appearance 
at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay with brother Hubert, the flutist, was 
canceled because of poor ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the Chula Vista Marina, take Interstate 5 south, exit at J Street, 
head west and follow the flags. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1989 album "Time Will Tell" on the verge of topping 100,000 in sales, 
San Diego jazz band Fattburger has released "Come and Get It," the follow-up. 
The group will host a record release party next Wednesday night at the 
Catamaran Resort Hotel in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On "Time Will Tell," Fattburger was boosted by guests like saxman Gerald 
Albright, but this time around they go it alone. Keyboardist Carl Evans Jr. 
wrote five songs, and guitarist Steve Laury, two. All of the material is 
original, except the band's version of Roberta Flack's "Feel Like Makin' Love." 
</P>
<P>
According to Evans, Flack's song has already emerged as a radio favorite, and 
he predicted that the "Pat Metheny-ish" tune "Almost an Angel," penned by 
Laury, will also make radio waves. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, the band will tour to support the new album, stopping in 
Sacramento, Fresno, Oakland, Anchorage and Houston before heading to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
There is no cover charge Wednesday night. The music starts at 8. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Saxophonist Najee is one of the most commercially successful light jazz 
artists around. His first two albums, "Najee's Theme" and "Day by Day," both 
sold more than 500,000 copies. His new album is called "Tokyo Blue." Najee 
plays Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay next Wednesday night at 8. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Hank Easton and his Easton West Band beat out top locals Peter 
Sprague, Mark Lessman, Fattburger and Aubrey Faye to win Best Jazz honors in 
this year's Entertainer Music Awards, presented at the La Paloma Theatre in 
Encinitas last week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco and vibraphonist Terry Gibbs team up Saturday night 
at 8:30 on KPBS-TV's "Club Date" jazz program, repeating Monday afternoon at 
1:30. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Flutist Holly Hofmann plays the Palace Bar in the Horton Grand Hotel downtown 
Friday and Saturday nights in a crack quartet including guitarist Peter 
Sprague, bassist Bob Magnusson and drummer Tim McMahon. . . .

in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown; Friday night, it's Latin jazz with Algo 
Caliente, and Sunday, saxophonist Joe Marillo's jam session.

Elizabeth Montgomery, best known for playing Samantha in the television show 
"Bewitched," will be one of the first set of stars in A.R. Gurney's "Love 
Letters" opening Oct. 22 at the Old Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
In the play the actors read letters on stage that were written over the decades 
between a man and a woman.

<P>
This unusual format avoids much memorization and long rehearsals and allows for 
rotating celebrity casts, which at the Old Globe will change on a weekly basis. 
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled for an Oct. 16 opening, "Love Letters" will make its San 
Diego debut Oct. 22, starring Montgomery and stage, film and television actor 
Robert Foxworth, who made his Old Globe debut in 1987 playing Antony in "Antony 
and Cleopatra." 
</P>
<P>
Beth Howland, who played the ditsy waitress Vera in the television show 
"Alice," will appear with Broadway actor Charles Kimbrough Oct. 30-Nov. 4. Old 
Globe Associate Artist Sada Thompson, a star of the television show "Family," 
will co-star with film actor Kevin McCarthy Nov. 6-11.

BUILDING PERMIT BILL MAY AFFECT SEWER IN MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW COUNTIES TO ISSUE BUILDING PERMITS IN 
SOON-TO-BE-INCORPORATED CITIES WAS AMENDED TO EXCLUDE MALIBU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A little-noticed measure that would ban Los Angeles County from issuing 
building permits in Malibu beginning in December may pose a threat to the 
county's bid to speed construction of its proposed $43-million sewer system 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Although not its intended purpose, a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Jim Costa 
(D-Fresno) could, if it became law, deal a severe blow to the county's efforts 
to start work on the sewer before a new Malibu government has the chance to 
block it. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was approved by the state Legislature and sent to Gov. George 
Deukmejian during the final week of the legislative session last month. 
Deukmejian has until Sunday to act on it. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials, who have urged the governor to veto a measure 
that would nullify their attempt to delay Malibu's becoming a city until next 
March, also are trying to persuade the governor to veto the Costa measure. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Deukmejian obtained by The Times, a lobbyist for the county 
warned that, if the measure becomes law, it may "deny the county the right to 
issue a building permit" for the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
In urging the governor to veto the bill, lobbyist Clancy Leland called it 
"unnecessary legislation" that would inhibit the county's efforts to safeguard 
Malibu residents from "a serious health problem." 
</P>
<P>
County officials have long insisted that the sewer system, which opponents say 
is intended to open the door to widespread development of the Malibu coast, is 
necessary to remedy pollution caused by leaking septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa measure, which has the support of the state's building industry, 
would allow counties to continue to issue building permits in communities where 
voters have approved cityhood but where incorporation has not yet taken place. 
</P>
<P>
It would replace an existing law that is to expire Dec. 31. Builders and real 
estate groups generally support the measure because it offers them time to get 
projects approved in communities where new governments -- -- and often more 
slow-growth-oriented city governments -- are waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the legislative session drew to a close, in a bid to avoid 
last-minute opposition from legislators sympathetic to Malibu cityhood, the 
measure was amended to exclude Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure becomes law, Los Angeles County's authority to issue building 
permits in Malibu would expire Dec. 3. In addition, permits previously issued 
by the county where no actual construction has taken place would become void on 
that date. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really ironic that a bill coveted by the building industry may be the 
vehicle to stop the sewer project," Malibu City Councilman-elect Mike Caggiano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood in June, the county has gone 
to court to delay the incorporation until next March and wants to start work on 
the sewer before Malibu's five-member City Council can officially take office. 
</P>
<P>
In approving a bid by Malibu residents to vote on cityhood last year, the Local 
Agency Formation Commission stipulated that the county be allowed to retain 
control over the sewer system for up to 10 years after incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of LAFCO, however, expressed doubts about the legality of the 
provision, and members of the unofficial City Council have made it clear that 
they favor challenging it once Malibu becomes a city. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county needs only to issue itself a building permit to start work 
on the sewer, it cannot do so without the approval of the California Coastal 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The county hopes to go before the state panel in November for permission to 
speed construction of the sewer without having to wait for other incremental 
approvals that ordinarily could be expected to take several more months. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission approves it, the county would be able to issue the permit 
before Dec. 3, and, barring unforeseen delays, could start work on the sewer 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu cityhood supporters view the bill as a backstop to legislation sponsored 
by Sen. Ed Davis (D-Santa Clarita) -- which is also awaiting action by the 
governor -- that would nullify the attempt by the County Board of Supervisors 
to delay cityhood until March 28. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood advocates have said that in the event Deukmejian rejects the 
incorporation bill, the Costa measure could prevent a rush of last-minute 
building permits from being approved by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has raised the ire of real estate brokers and prospective home 
builders in Malibu, who contend that, if enacted into law, it could wreck the 
plans of would-be builders who have already obtained permits from the county, 
and whose permits would automatically become invalid. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a situation where, if the county's permits expire at the beginning of 
December, and there's no city, and no (official) City Council with authority to 
extend those permits, everything is at a standstill," real estate broker Tom 
Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Malibu Board of Realtors said the group has urged 
Deukmejian to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It changes the rules in the middle of the game as far as we're concerned," 
said the spokesman, real estate broker Don Posey. "How would you like to spend 
a half-million dollars for a piece of land and thousands more as part of the 
permit process only to be told your permit is no longer valid?" 
</P>
<P>
Some backers of both the Costa measure and the cityhood bill, meanwhile, have 
urged Malibu residents to flood the governor's office with phone calls of 
support for the measures. 
</P>
<P>
A flyer that was distributed in the Point Dume area, which did not identify its 
sponsor, urged residents to call Deukmejian's office "many times," adding that 
they should "give a different name" each time.

COUNCIL TO EXTEND BAN 2 MONTHS ON NEW APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale City Council members agreed Tuesday to extend the moratorium on new 
apartment and condominium construction until Jan. 8, allowing them more time to 
approve the final pieces of a citywide growth-control program. 
</P>
<P>
The council also reached a consensus on two of the growth-control elements: a 
building cap ordinance, which will limit the number of new houses built 
annually, and a variance procedure, which will aid single-family house owners 
who are surrounded by large apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
The building freeze was approved in September, 1988, after council members 
became concerned about traffic congestion, parking problems and overcrowded 
parks and schools, all attributed to a boom in apartment and condominium 
construction. After a successful court challenge by developers, a new 
moratorium was adopted in October, 1989. It was scheduled to expire Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Councilman Jerold Milner requested that the moratorium be extended 
until next June to give the council time to adopt new growth controls. But at 
Tuesday's meeting, other council members complained that Milner's proposed 
extension was too long. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need something that will force us to make decisions before the end 
of the year," Councilman Carl Raggio said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I think we need to give ourselves ample time, I think 60 days is 
plenty," said Mayor Larry Zarian, who scheduled a council study session for 8 
a.m. Tuesday to expedite the growth-control decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to set ourselves a deadline, deal with it and be done with it, 
and let the community get back to business," Councilman Richard Jutras said. 
</P>
<P>
Milner and Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg expressed concerns that the 
growth-control measures may not be completed before the end of the year, but 
they agreed to support the 60-day extension. The council can extend it again, 
although council members said they hope they will not have to do so. 
</P>
<P>
After several weeks of debate, the council also tentatively agreed on a 
building cap ordinance. Under the ordinance, the city would issue up to 700 
building permits annually for apartments, condominiums and detached houses that 
will be sold or rented at prevailing market rates. 
</P>
<P>
The permits for multiple-family housing will be awarded through a quarterly 
competition, in which city planners will give the first permits to the projects 
judged to have the best quality. 
</P>
<P>
Another 700 permits designated only for affordable housing will be issued on a 
first-come, first-served basis without a competition. 
</P>
<P>
The building cap ordinance is expected to be introduced next week, with final 
approval scheduled one week later. 
</P>
<P>
The council still must approve a downzoning plan, which will reduce the number 
of units that a property owner can build on each lot. Some residents have 
complained that downzoning will pose a hardship if they can build only a duplex 
on a lot that is surrounded by large apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, City Planner Jim Glaser said about 200 such lots exist 
citywide, but the council can grant higher zoning to owners on a case-by-case 
basis, through a variance procedure. Council members unanimously agreed to 
follow that policy.

RENOVATION OF OLD LIBRARY A STEP CLOSER; 
</P>
<P>
EAGLE ROCK: THE CITY WILL SEEK BIDS TO COMPILE A REPORT ON THE HISTORIC VALUE 
OF THE BUILDING, WHICH CLOSED IN 1981. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles officials are expected this week to take a major step toward 
renovating and reopening a landmark Eagle Rock building that was closed almost 
a decade ago because of structural safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The city Bureau of Engineering was to seek bids from consultants to prepare a 
report describing the historic and architectural value of the old Eagle Rock 
Library at 2225 Colorado Blvd., said Neil Drucker, an environmental supervisor 
with the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
After the report is considered by the state Office of Historic Preservation, 
probably next spring, the city could prepare specific reconstruction plans, 
Drucker said. He estimated that renovation could begin in early 1992 and be 
finished a year later. 
</P>
<P>
The old library was built more than 70 years ago when Eagle Rock was an 
independent city. It was closed in 1981 after a new, larger library opened 
nearby. City officials said the older building needs earthquake reinforcement, 
asbestos removal and other renovation -- all expected to cost $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
This month, members of the library's restoration advisory committee, formed two 
years ago, learned the money woes that have delayed their project are 
apparently over. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who represents Eagle Rock, informed the panel that 
a bond measure approved in June by Los Angeles voters, combined with earlier 
state historic preservation grants, should provide adequate funding. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members said the announcement breathes life into their plan to turn 
the musty old library into a neighborhood gathering place intended mainly for 
art classes and exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thrilled," said Istiharoh Glasgow, an Eagle Rock Chamber of Commerce 
board member who serves on the committee. "I think it's a really important step 
for Eagle Rock. We have a multicultural area. We need a place where people can 
get together and share their culture and build an understanding of each other." 
</P>
<P>
In June, voters approved Proposition G, a bond measure to fund seismic safety 
improvements in city-owned buildings and bridges. All city buildings, occupied 
or vacant, that need seismic reinforcement are earmarked to receive Proposition 
G funds, said Bill Mercer, chief administrative analyst with the city's 
administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the election, Alatorre announced that the bonds would provide 
$1.2 million to renovate the historic old Northeast Police Station in Highland 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in a letter titled "Good News," the councilman told Eagle Rock 
leaders that the same measure would provide $434,000 to reinforce their old 
library. That was added to $480,500 in state historic preservation money 
received earlier. The councilman said the project was still about $70,000 
short. 
</P>
<P>
But in a follow-up Sept. 14 letter titled "Even Better News," Alatorre said his 
staff discovered that the bond measure also will provide $201,000 for removal 
of hazardous asbestos and reconstruction for handicapped access. 
</P>
<P>
It also supplies money for design work, a contingency fund and to compensate 
for inflation. Together, more than $1.3 million has now been allocated to 
repair and reopen the library. 
</P>
<P>
Funding now exceeds the original budget estimate, but the surplus may be needed 
to solve a serious parking shortage. The old library has no public lot, and 
visitors to the renovated building would have to park on busy Colorado 
Boulevard or on nearby residential streets. City officials feared that the 
latter would trigger complaints from homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"We always knew parking would be an issue, but we did not know how to address 
the financing until recently," said William Creitz, a senior analyst with the 
city's Department of General Services, which took possession of the library 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
Creitz said the additional funds may be used to buy or lease land near the 
library for a parking lot. But restrictions attached to the bonds and the state 
grants could prohibit their use for a parking lot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the renovation itself will involve delicate, time-consuming work so 
that the library's architecture is not damaged. Reinforcement of the roof, for 
example, will probably require that individual tiles be removed and 
re-installed. 
</P>
<P>
The building is believed to date to 1914, when Eagle Rock leaders obtained a 
$7,500 Carnegie Foundation grant to establish a city library. The building, 
designed in a Mission revival style, also served as a busy community center. 
</P>
<P>
When Eagle Rock became part of Los Angeles in 1923, the library joined the 
city's system. It underwent major remodeling in the Spanish style four years 
later, but the two-story structure has remained virtually unchanged since. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the City Council designated it a historic-cultural monument, and local 
leaders began considering a future use for it. 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow of the Eagle Rock chamber said the advisory committee ruled out a 
day-care center because of traffic and parking problems and the lack of 
playground space. A plan for a social service center offering health and 
counseling programs was dropped because no funds were available for such 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The committee decided the old library should become a community arts center. 
"We'll have classes in art, sculpture and drama," Kate Pedigo, an Eagle Rock 
artist and committee member, said. "There's a small theater in the basement." 
</P>
<P>
She added that it will provide badly needed exhibition space for the 
community's artists. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the arts programs, some committee members hope the restored library will 
reserve some room for senior citizen and veterans information and for service 
and social club meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's suggestions are being considered by Councilman Alatorre, whose 
recommendation will probably be endorsed by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the city's Cultural Affairs Department, which oversees about 
a dozen community arts programs, have participated in discussions with the 
Eagle Rock library committee. But Alatorre has not formally recommended that 
the restored library be turned over to that department. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there's nothing definitive," department spokeswoman Sandra Rivkin 
said. "But the city doesn't have an arts center in that area at this time, so 
certainly the interest is there."

POLITICAL BRAWL OVER HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: COPING WITH TRANSIENTS EMERGES AS A MAJOR ELECTION ISSUE. 
PROPOSITION Y SEEKS TO OUST CITY ATTY. ROBERT MYERS, WHO OPPONENTS SAY IS TOO 
SOFT ON THE HOMELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some love him, some hate him, but no one in Santa Monica is likely to accuse 
City Atty. Robert M. Myers of being a conventional, play-it-safe politician. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Myers has been the official most closely identified with Santa 
Monica's tolerant attitude toward the homeless. A determined social activist, 
he regularly volunteers to help at the food handouts that take place each 
afternoon in front of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
His refusal to prosecute transients for some nonviolent minor crimes draws 
praise from supporters who see him as a person of compassion and enlightenment. 
Critics, however, regard Myers as the person most responsible for making Santa 
Monica a magnet for troublemakers, freeloaders and aggressive panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nine years after he was first appointed to the job by the City Council, 
Myers is the target of a ballot measure, Proposition Y in the Nov. 6 election, 
aimed at removing him from office by making the office elective rather than 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Myers offers no apologies. In fact, when he held an anti-Proposition Y 
fund-raising event last month, the invitations urged those who came to bring 
along a homeless friend. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness, and how the city should respond to the problem, has emerged as a 
major issue in the city elections. In addition to Proposition Y, the issue 
figures prominently in the City Council campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Nine candidates are seeking three seats on the council, and all have felt 
obliged to take a public position on Proposition Y -- four are in favor, and 
five opposed. Several of the candidates have also made the issue of 
homelessness a central theme of their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent weeks, attention has also focused on the tactics of Proposition 
Y's chief advocate, Leslie Dutton, president of the conservative Assn. of 
American Women, because of what opponents call misleading and personal attacks 
on Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Further muddying the water is the fact that some voters who have lost battles 
with Myers over rent control or development issues are supporting the ballot 
measure because they say it is the only way to get him out of office. Myers has 
been city attorney since 1981 and is the author of the city's tough 
rent-control law and an advocate of more affordable housing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines and generally frustrated with the entire situation are 
officials from social service agencies that deal with the homeless. With 
limited success, they are urging City Council candidates to tone down the 
rhetoric and seriously discuss what they consider a complicated regional and 
national problem. 
</P>
<P>
Vivian Rothstein, executive director of the Ocean Park Community Center, which 
offers shelter and other programs for homeless people, said there has been a 
tendency over the years in Santa Monica and elsewhere for local candidates to 
try "to use homelessness to get elected." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a reprehensible thing," she said. "Homeless people are the most 
powerless people. This is not an issue that can be solved by a local election." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Reed, the lone incumbent among the nine council candidates, was quick 
out of the blocks last month with a flurry of press releases indicating her 
indignation over a recent incident in which police officers did not remove two 
homeless men from sleeping overnight on the grounds of Franklin Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Reed said she was "thoroughly fed up with the current council 
majority's laissez-faire attitude toward the ever-worsening homeless problem." 
</P>
<P>
Reed says she has fought for several years to get a workable homeless policy in 
the city, but has been thwarted by the council majority. She is pushing for 
implementation of a program that would put homeless people to work cleaning up 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we have to enforce local laws to protect our citizens," said 
Reed, who supports Proposition Y. "We cannot allow an elitist majority in City 
Hall, with their handpicked city attorney, to continually turn their backs on 
their responsibility to protect law-abiding citizens of this community." 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates, in particular attorney Kathleen Schwallie, say Reed has 
seized on the homeless issue only to divert attention from an issue on which 
she is vulnerable: her support over the years for many large development 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to assure that her record is made clear during the campaign," 
Schwallie said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition Y, which would amend the City Charter to make the city attorney an 
elected official rather than a council appointee, was placed on the ballot 
through an initiative drive that collected nearly 11,000 signatures after the 
stabbing last spring of an 89-year-old woman by a transient. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton blames Myers' tolerant attitude toward homeless people for a rise in 
crime by transients. She said the free daily feeding program at City Hall 
encourages more homeless people to come to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We have created a Mecca for a disaster," she said. "Santa Monica has become 
the home of the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents are supporting the measure out of frustration of having lost 
their parks and beaches to homeless people who sleep there. Others are annoyed 
at being asked for money by transients while dining at outdoor cafes or simply 
walking around the city. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how many homeless people there are in Santa Monica, but 
social service officials believe that hundreds of people are living on city 
streets and beaches. Social workers generally concur that the Santa 
Monica-Venice area harbors the largest concentration of homeless in Los Angeles 
County outside of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton and other supporters of Proposition Y contend that the city's annual 
$2-million commitment to homeless programs citywide and Myers' reluctance to 
aggressively prosecute misdemeanor crimes committed by transients add up to a 
welcome mat for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as transients perceive a hands-off policy here, they are going to keep 
coming here," said Jean Sedillos, co-chairwoman of Concerned Homeowners of 
Santa Monica, a citywide homeowner group supporting the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton, meanwhile, has gone beyond the homeless issue to attack Myers for other 
things. Citing his several trespassing arrests at protests of nuclear testing 
and in opposition to U.S. policies in Central America, she has labeled him a 
"convicted and habitual criminal." Dutton also recently ran an ad in the Los 
Angeles Journal, a legal paper, soliciting applications for the job of elected 
city attorney -- which, of course, does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Myers' allies have launched a counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a supporter of the measure, I would be embarrassed by the way the 
campaign has been handled so far," said attorney Chris Harding. 
</P>
<P>
A group of lawyers from Santa Monica opposing the measure also questioned 
Dutton's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have often disagreed with our city attorney's positions," the group's 
statement said. "However, as attorneys we respect honest disagreement, provided 
that the rules of fair play are observed. . . . Supporters of the elected city 
attorney initiative have trampled on fair play and integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Dennis Zane, a longtime Myers supporter, has tried to shift the 
discussion of Proposition Y away from Myers and the homeless problems, saying 
it is a question of whether the office of the city attorney should be an 
elected office. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be assured of the skills of someone elected to office," he said at a 
recent debate sponsored by the Santa Monica Area Chamber of Commerce. "We do 
not simply need another politician. We have enough with seven politicians." 
</P>
<P>
But Dutton countered that Myers already had politicized the job with his 
numerous arrests in connection with what she called "trendy political causes." 
</P>
<P>
Zane and other opponents of the measure have argued that if people are unhappy 
with Myers, they should make it a campaign issue in the upcoming election for 
three seats on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it would take five of seven City Council votes to remove Myers -- 
something that most political observers in the city regard as unlikely to 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, some of Myers' longtime adversaries on other issues are embracing 
Proposition Y as a means to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"Something has got to give somewhere," said James Baker, a landlord who is 
active in the fight to weaken the city's tough rent-control system. "I don't 
know any other practical, pragmatic way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
So far in the campaign, Myers has been uncharacteristically reticent. He 
initially refused to respond at all to Dutton's charges, but recently has 
countered by calling her remarks false and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, he said the real victim of Dutton's campaign is the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Dutton has failed to offer any constructive solutions to the national 
disgrace of men, women and children living on our streets," he said. "Stirring 
up fear and prejudice is not helpful in addressing the tragic problems 
associated with homelessness in America." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other residents and officials from social service agencies are 
hoping there can be a real discussion of the homeless issue during the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should ask the different City Council candidates for their position 
on the issue," said Daniel R. Kingsley, a vice president with the Maguire 
Thomas Partners development firm and co-chairman of the Chamber of Commerce's 
homeless task force. "We shouldn't let their lack of interest keep them from 
addressing the real issue." 
</P>
<P>
At the Ocean Park Community Center, Vivian Rothstein concurs. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not matter who is city attorney in Santa Monica; this is a mental 
health crisis," she said. "I wish the energy going toward slamming Bob Myers 
would go to fighting the closure of mental health clinics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Proposition Y, one of 10 ballot measures to be considered by Santa Monica 
voters Nov. 6, would make the city attorney an elected position rather than one 
appointed by the City Council. It was placed on the ballot through an 
initiative drive sponsored by community members concerned about crime and 
aggressive panhandling by the city's sizable population of homeless people. 
City Atty. Robert M. Myers has been targeted by the group because of his 
reluctance to prosecute nonviolent crimes committed by the homeless. Four City 
Council candidates have endorsed Proposition Y, and five are opposed to it. In 
favor are Robert T. Holbrook, Larry Jon Hobbs, Donna Alvarez, and incumbent 
Councilwoman Christine Reed. Opposed are Tony Vasquez, Kelly Olsen, Kathleen 
Schwallie, Sharon L. Gilpin and Jean Gebman.

2 BILLS TO BEEF UP COASTAL AGENCY'S POWERS ARE VETOED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: LEGISLATION'S SUPPORTERS EXPECT A MORE SYMPATHETIC GOVERNOR NEXT 
YEAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, a longtime critic of the California Coastal Commission, 
has vetoed two bills aimed at giving the agency more power to crack down on 
illegal development. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the legislation anticipate that the proposals will be revived 
next year, will again clear the Legislature and get a more sympathetic 
reception from the next governor. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting two measures by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), 
Deukmejian said the Coastal Commission "already has adequate enforcement powers 
against violators if used in a prudent and rational manner." 
</P>
<P>
The veto messages by Deukmejian, who decided not to seek reelection this year, 
were released last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
One of Rosenthal's bills would have given the commission the power to impose 
fines and issue cease-and-desist orders without going to court when ongoing 
violations of coastal development procedures are occurring. 
</P>
<P>
The other bill would have required the panel to develop and implement a 
comprehensive enforcement program, in part to determine where illegal activity 
is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
In vetoing the bill that would have allowed the commission to impose fines and 
issue cease-and-desist orders, Deukmejian repeated objections that he raised 
last year, when he vetoed a similar measure. The governor said he appreciated 
the aim of Rosenthal's efforts, but said he does not believe the commission 
"should have the sole authority" to stop illegal projects and levy substantial 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian rejected the second Rosenthal bill as unnecessary. He said that 
rather than devise a comprehensive enforcement program, the commission should 
focus on completing local coastal development plans that have not been written 
for large sections of the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Liebster, a spokesman for the commission, maintained that the panel needs 
expanded enforcement authority, citing a backlog of more than 700 pending 
cases. "Putting teeth in the law would create a deterrent to this abuse. We 
hope the Legislature speedily passes this legislation again in the new 
session," Liebster said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Hart, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said that based on the 
environmental records of the two major party gubernatorial candidates -- 
Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein -- either one probably 
would look more kindly on proposals to beef up enforcement. "It will be much 
easier" next year for the measures to become law, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Hart assailed Deukmejian's vetoes "as yet another expression of the governor's 
irrational vendetta against an important environmental protection agency." 
</P>
<P>
The commission has been a favorite target of Deukmejian's since he took office 
in 1983. Unable to abolish the panel and turn its duties over to local 
government, Deukmejian has drastically reduced its budget and staff. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Rosenthal said: "The governor has had a longstanding 
aversion to the Coastal Commission, but I am surprised that he has allowed it 
to color his decision on this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal charged that weak enforcement during Deukmejian's Administration has 
led to parts of the coast being damaged beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Rosenthal said the senator, whose district covers much of the 
Westside, is fully committed to introducing even stronger versions of the same 
measures in the next legislative session.

REDEVELOPMENT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Community Redevelopment Agency is seeking public comment on two plans that 
deal with the revitalization of Hollywood and traffic problems affecting the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA last week released the draft transportation and urban design plans that 
incorporated input from the community and advisory board that was gathered over 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Public comment will be sought on the plans until Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Hollywood Transportation Plan includes road improvements, traffic 
management, expanded public transit, reduction of adverse impacts of Metro Rail 
construction, parking and financing. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Hollywood Boulevard District Urban Design Plan makes 
recommendations to enhance and preserve the architectural and functional 
character of the landmark thoroughfare. It provides for more sidewalks and open 
space, includes residential and mixed-use development and contains incentives 
for reuse and rehabilitation of significant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Comment on both plans will be taken at the biennial public hearing for the 
entire $922-million Hollywood renewal project, scheduled for Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. 
at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 7000 Hollywood Blvd. The CRA Board of 
Commissioners is expected to schedule another public hearing on the two plans 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment officials say they hope the transportation and urban design plans 
will be ready for adoption by June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the plans are available for review at the Hollywood Redevelopment 
Project site office at 6255 Sunset Blvd., suite 711, the Hollywood branch of 
the Public Library, 1623 Ivar Ave., the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce office, 
6255 Sunset Blvd., Suite 911, and the Hollywood Economic Revitalization Effort 
project office, 6541 Hollywood Blvd. For more information, call the 
redevelopment project office at (213) 461-1066.

RADIO EQUIPMENT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a 3-1 vote Tuesday, the City Council agreed to spend $342,888 to buy radio 
equipment that will permit communication among all city departments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is one case where more is better than less," Mayor Nicholas L. 
Presecan said, backing a staff proposal to accept bids from Motorola, 
Dictaphone and Instant Replay. 
</P>
<P>
The city communications system needs to be refurbished for use in a disaster 
such as the Feb. 28 Upland earthquake, city officials said. The current police 
radios operate on VHF frequencies incompatible with the UHF frequencies of 
community services radios, and most of the equipment is more than 15 years old 
and unreliable, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Algird Leiga voted against the project, favoring a proposal to 
buy less equipment and save $7,184.

<P>
Malibu's unofficial City Council voted Tuesday to meet twice monthly instead of 
weekly, beginning in November. 
</P>
<P>
With the selection of a city attorney, an interim city manager and City Hall 
space behind them, several council members said there was little point in 
continuing to meet weekly until incorporation occurs. However, the council 
decided to begin the new schedule in November because agenda items have already 
been set for three Tuesdays in October.

HORAN NAMED TO SUPERIOR COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presiding judge of the Glendale Municipal Court, honored earlier this year 
as a top Los Angeles County jurist, has been named to the Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment last week of Charles Horan, who will take the Superior Court 
bench on Oct. 1, leaves empty the second of three Glendale judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
The first fell vacant Aug. 25 when Judge Cheryl Krott died. 
</P>
<P>
The third judge, Barbara Burke, and three commissioners will handle all cases 
until Gov. George Deukmejian appoints two new judges, which may occur by the 
end of the year, said Karla Olson, Glendale court administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Horan, 39, was appointed to the Municipal Court bench in April, 1988, after 
seven years as a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney. The Los Angeles 
County Bar Assn. this summer named Horan the county's Municipal Court judge of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Horan was well-known as an intelligent, no-nonsense judge whose sense of humor 
often put attorneys and defendants at ease, court officials said. The jurist 
also became known for playing guitar in a rock 'n' roll band called "Use a 
Guitar and Go to Prison," in which his wife and several attorneys played.

PERMIT PARKING ZONE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council Tuesday night introduced an ordinance establishing a 
preferential parking zone in the area surrounding the Santa Monica Hospital and 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Non-residential parking will be restricted to two hours between 9 a.m. and 9 
p.m. on weekdays and from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The parking zone is bounded by 14th Street, Wilshire Boulevard, 20th Street and 
Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is a compromise between residents, who wanted no parking for 
non-residents, and the nearby churches and businesses that did not want any 
restrictions.

GLENOAKS CANYON: PLANNING COMMISSION MEMBERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF 
AN ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a four-hour hearing Monday night before the Glendale Planning 
Commission, Glenoaks Canyon residents charged that a developer's plans to build 
25 hillside houses off Sleepy Hollow Place will destroy scenic terrain, create 
traffic hazards and add to crowding at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
Several commission members also said they were concerned about the quality of 
the project's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
The panel postponed a vote on the project until Oct. 8, saying that it was late 
and that commissioners needed more time to review the report. 
</P>
<P>
"At this hour, we ought not to be rushing a decision," said Commissioner Don M. 
Pearson. But he added, "I certainly have a significant number of reservations 
about this project." Commissioner Ted K. Osborn described the housing tract's 
environmental study as "a flawed document." 
</P>
<P>
Developer Ken Doty is seeking permission to build 25 hillside houses on the 
30-acre Sleepy Hollow site. Doty wants to cut a ridgeline and use the earth to 
fill an adjacent canyon area, creating pads for the new houses. 
</P>
<P>
The city's planning staff has recommended that he be allowed to build all but 
one of the proposed houses, saying the 25th lot would require excessive 
grading. The staff has urged that Doty be required to pave a fire road to 
provide a second access to the tract for emergency vehicles only. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 people attended Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we have produced an environmentally sound proposal," said 
Doty's attorney, John M. Gantus. 
</P>
<P>
But Dave Weaver, president of the Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Assn., said, "We 
are 100% opposed to the tract map that is presented. We do not want this in our 
canyon." 
</P>
<P>
He charged that the environmental impact report was inadequate because it did 
not provide other development options that would not require cutting into the 
ridgeline. Weaver also said that paving the fire road is unnecessary and would 
likely lead to more hillside housing development along the route. 
</P>
<P>
The planning commission must forward its recommendation to the Glendale City 
Council, which has scheduled a special meeting Nov. 1 to consider the Sleepy 
Hollow project. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has prompted Glenoaks Canyon homeowners to urge that the city sell 
bonds and raise property taxes to purchase and preserve undeveloped hillside 
land in Glendale.

APPEALS COURT RULES IN RENT SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
WEST HOLLYWOOD: THE LANDLADY, WHO DIED LAST YEAR, CLAIMED HARDSHIP OVER LOW 
RENTS. THE DECISION WILL ALLOW HER ESTATE TO INCREASE THEM TO MARKET-LEVEL 
RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The estate of a West Hollywood landlady, who charged her tenants very low 
rents, will be allowed to double the rents on the units to levels comparable to 
other rent-controlled apartments in the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
The 2nd District Court of Appeal issued the ruling last week in a lawsuit filed 
in 1986 by Mary Simonson, who claimed severe economic hardship in her request 
to raise rents in her apartment building. Simonson died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord groups immediately hailed the decision as a major triumph that will 
encourage other landlords charging below-market rents at the time their cities 
adopted tough rent-control ordinances to push for substantial increases. 
</P>
<P>
"This will have a substantial impact in West Hollywood, Santa Monica and 
elsewhere," said Christopher M. Harding, the attorney who represented Simonson. 
</P>
<P>
But while Harding and others view the decision as having broad implications, 
officials in West Hollywood saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
"We read it as being a very narrow decision arising out of very peculiar 
circumstances," said City Atty. Michael Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the Simonson case is unique because the rents she charged on 
seven units of the nine units she rented in her building on Hancock Avenue were 
far lower than market value at the time the city enacted its rent-control 
ordinance in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The one-room and one-bedroom apartments, ranging in monthly rents from $72 to 
$206, were kept at a low rate as part of an arrangement with her tenants who, 
in exchange, agreed to help shoulder the cost of the building's upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
Simonson raised rents in 1984 before the passage of rent control, but rents 
were rolled back when the new law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, spiraling medical bills forced Simonson to appeal to the 
city's Rent Stabilization Commission for relief. But the commission spurned her 
request. As a result, the 87-year-old widow filed a lawsuit against the city 
and overnight became a symbol of the landlord's struggle against the city's 
tough rent control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of a lawsuit, the commission allowed Simonson to increase 
her monthly rents to between $149 and $351. But attorneys for Simonson said the 
increase still left Simonson's units well below the market value. They 
continued to press the lawsuit for increases to a range between $325 and $550 a 
month per unit. 
</P>
<P>
Harding produced an appraisal, supporting the increase, and the appellate court 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In its decision, the court confirmed an earlier 1988 Santa Monica Superior 
Court ruling ordering the commission to take into account the rents of 
comparable units in the area when deciding a fair-market rent. 
</P>
<P>
Harding said the court's decision increases the total monthly rental income on 
the seven units rented to $2,750 plus a 35% cost of living increase, or $3,600 
per month, from $1,227 allowed under the commission's most recent ruling. In 
1984, the building brought in only $925 in monthly rents. 
</P>
<P>
City officials criticized the court's decision saying it ignored the tenants 
who still live in the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very troubled, and other people on the council are very troubled that the 
court seems to be totally oblivious to what is going to happen to the tenants 
in that building, many of whom are very old and would be devastated by 
additional rent increases," said Mayor John Heilman. "Someone has to think 
about what will happen to those tenants." 
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door session of the City Council Monday night, Assistant City 
Atty. Christi Hogan said the city will ask the court to reconsider its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with the low rents, she was receiving a better return on her investment 
than many landlords," Hogan said. "Even though her rents were low, her expenses 
were also very low, and she practically had no mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
Hogan said that the city will also ask the court to decertify its decision as 
precedent for landlords seeking consideration because their units were below 
market value at the time rent control was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
But landlord advocate groups say the Simonson case was not unusual and will 
lead to more challenges of the rent-control law. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 35% of the apartment units in the city were under the market (level) at 
the time of the rent roll-back (in 1984)," said Grafton Tanquary, an apartment 
building owner and leader of the West Hollywood Concerned Citizens, a landlord 
lobbying group. "The city needs to stop sticking its head in the sand and find 
some solutions to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Harding criticized the city's decision to ask the court to decertify its 
ruling. "This indicates that West Hollywood intends to continue its harsh and 
unfair policy toward smaller owners like Mrs. Simonson who maintain low rents," 
he said. "We find their conduct to be disgusting and embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gross, the executive director of the Coalition for Economic Survival, a 
tenants rights group, said the court's decision has opened old sores. "This is 
just another indication that a hostile environment still exists between the 
landlords and tenants," he said. "It's not as big a deal as the landlords would 
make it out to be, but it does represent a chipping away of the city's 
rent-control ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Opinions varied on what the ruling's impact would be in Santa Monica. Landlord 
and tenants rights groups are campaigning for two competing initiatives on the 
November ballot, offering differing versions of vacancy decontrol. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lambert, a landlord attorney, said the court's decision could force the 
rent-control board in Santa Monica to increase rents on tenants who have been 
paying below-market value. But Lambert said landlords might back away from 
filing lawsuits if the voters approve the landlord-sponsored Proposition U, 
which would allow landlords to rent units at the market level when voluntarily 
vacated by tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Jones, co-chairman of Santa Monicans For Renters' Rights, agreed that the 
decision could have a broad impact but said the solution lies in passage of the 
initiative sponsored by the Santa Monica City Council, Proposition W, which 
sets specific increases on units voluntarily vacated by tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, whose Proposition W is viewed as an effort by tenants to compromise with 
landlords, was critical of West Hollywood's handling of the Simonson case. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that they took a hard line when they could have settled 
this thing out of court," he said. "They botched it."

2 LOADED FREIGHT TRAILERS STOLEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two freight trailers, one loaded with Christmas mugs and plastic tumblers, were 
stolen from a freight company's parking lot across from the Northeast Division 
police station on San Fernando Road in Glassell Park, Los Angeles police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Employees noticed the trailers missing from the lot in the 3400 block of San 
Fernando Road Tuesday morning and notified police, said Officer Enrique 
Conrado. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe a tractor rig was used to haul the trailers off the lot sometime 
between Friday afternoon and Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Other empty and more accessible trailers were ignored, police said. The 
trailers had arrived at the facility Friday from docks in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
One of the trailers contained about $33,000 worth of mugs and plastic tumblers 
and the other contained about $46,000 worth of an unknown type of gift sets.

teams and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
However, Desotell is not covering any of Ribet Academy's football games for the 
Glendale News-Press this season. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he's coaching in them.

<P>
Desotell, 31, succeeded Harry Morgan as coach of the Fighting Frogs after 
serving as their offensive coordinator for the final three games last season. 
</P>
<P>
Desotell, who has the team off to a 2-1 start heading into Friday's game 
against powerful Antelope Valley Christian (3-0), said he's enjoying the 
challenge of moving from the press box to the sidelines. 
</P>

play Los Angeles Southwest (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
After losing to Pasadena three weeks ago, Glendale was pounded, 31-3, by a 
Bakersfield College team that was ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
"Bakersfield flat outplayed us," Glendale Coach John Cicuto said. "They could 
be gearing up for another national championship." 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing tapes of the loss to the Renegades, Cicuto said he is 
encouraged by the progress the Vaqueros have made. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing against teams like Pasadena and Bakersfield is going to help us in the 
long run," Cicuto said. "We've been improving in certain areas even though we 
haven't won. 
</P>
<P>
"But getting that first victory is important." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Marco Arcipreste, who missed the Bakersfield game with a finger 
injury, will start for Glendale against L.A. Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Back to SCIAC: Occidental College resumes Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference play Saturday when the Tigers (1-2 overall, 1-0 in SCIAC 
play) travel to La Verne (0-2, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
Occidental lost to Azusa Pacific, 28-10, in a nonconference game last week, but 
the Tigers figure to remain unbeaten in conference play, at least for a while: 
La Verne has already lost to Redlands and the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Coach Dale Widolff will start freshman quarterback Derrick Williams, 
who completed four of 14 passes for 25 yards against Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"We're young at the skill positions on offense and that's affecting our 
consistency," Widolff said. "Our intensity on defense also has not been 
consistent. We haven't been able to sustain any kind of consistent effort for 
the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
KOd: The Franklin High football team, the defending City Section 3-A Division 
champion, was shut out by perennial 4-A contender Kennedy, 36-0, Saturday in a 
game in which the Panthers lost quarterback Julio Moreno and their entire 
defensive backfield to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno was knocked out with bruised ribs in the second quarter and the 
secondary was decimated throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a physical beating," Franklin Coach Ed Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite going with fourth-string quarterback Tony Aguilar, Franklin was behind 
only 15-0 with two minutes left in the third quarter when Kennedy scored 21 
points in a two-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin's second- and third-string quarterbacks were sidelined with injuries 
during practice that week. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno and other injured Franklin players are being evaluated on a day-to-day 
basis this week as the Panthers prepare for 3-A opponent Los Angeles High. 
</P>
<P>
What, me pass?: The game plan against Bell-Jeff called for strikes through the 
air, but Glendale High Coach Don Shoemaker made adjustments when standout 
tailback Pathon Rucker rushed for 75 yards in the first quarter of Friday's 
30-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, a junior, gained 163 yards and scored four touchdowns as the Dynamiters 
improved to 3-0 heading into Friday night's game at Burroughs -- the first of 
three consecutive away games. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker has rushed for 524 yards (an average of 174.6 a game) and scored nine 
touchdowns for a Glendale offense that is averaging 368 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Dynamiter defense, led by linebacker Waki Jones and free safety Eli 
Enriquez, also has been excellent, limiting opponents to 136.6 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Leader board: Hoover quarterback Rene Gambri played with a sprained ankle in 
the Tornadoes' loss at Monrovia last week, but he still leads Glendale-area 
passers with 503 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Chris Kalaleh is the area's leading receiver with 14 receptions 
for 223 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Award time: Former Hoover High and Glendale College linebacker Steve Hieber 
made the most of his second start on the four-year college level, earning Big 
West Conference defensive player of the week honors for his team-high 10 
tackles in San Jose State's 47-13 win over Nevada Las Vegas on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Included in Hieber's total were two sacks and two tackles for losses as the 
Spartans limited the Rebels to 12 yards rushing and 138 yards in offense. 
</P>
<P>
Can't touch this: La Canada fumbled seven times, but lost only two in its 20-7 
win over Burroughs on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a new center in on three of them and we changed the exchange on 
handoffs," La Canada Coach Nic Larez said. "It better not happen again or we'll 
be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Getting their kicks: The Occidental College women's soccer team set four school 
records in a 14-0 win over La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Jos Bergmann scored five goals, the first after 52 seconds, and had three 
assists to set Occidental records for most goals in a match, quickest goal at 
the start of the match and most points (13) in a match. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers' 14 goals also set a school record.

SHIRIKJIAN BECOMES GLENDALE'S SAFETY NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vatche Shirikjian did not care much for water polo the first time he tried the 
sport. Navigating the length of a pool while begoggled and in a swimsuit was 
not Shirikjian's strong suit, so he quit after only a few practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else was a good swimmer except for me," said Shirikjian, then a 
seventh-grader. "I said, 'Forget it. I don't want to do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
A year later, for reasons he cannot remember, Shirikjian (pronounced 
Shi-RIK-Jin) was back in the pool, flailing alongside swifter swimmers. His 
confidence -- and body -- again was sinking fast until his coach decided to put 
those long flailing arms to use in the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Shirikjian is a 6-foot-2 sophomore at Glendale High, the starting goalie 
for a senior-dominated team expected to make a run at the Pacific League title. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized right from the start I had a gem of a goalie," said Glendale Coach 
Pat Lancaster, who took over the Dynamiter program when Pete Loporchio left to 
become coach at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale was 7-2 entering Wednesday's Pacific League opener with Crescenta 
Valley. Results of that match were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
Experience makes the Dynamiters a contender for the league title this year, 
along with defending champion Hoover, perennial power Muir and Crescenta 
Valley, which is led by high-scoring Morgan Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is led by seniors Chris Petrossian, Bruce Wright, Cheyenne Luck, 
Anthony Rossi, Chris Jaurigue and Matt Heimerl. The Dynamiters were 13-12 
overall and 4-2 in league matches last year. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Glendale's hope is riding on the still broadening shoulders of the 
15-yard-old Shirikjian, a member of last season's Dynamiter frosh-soph team 
that won the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Vatche has always been somewhat rambunctious, but he's also a student of the 
game, which you don't always see in young players," said Loporchio, who moved 
Shirikjian to the goal when he was 13. "With his size and ability at this 
point, he could be a major-college player if he continues to develop quickness 
and speed." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his potential, Shirikjian probably is not the best goalie in the 
Glendale area this season. 
</P>
<P>
That distinction belongs to Hoover senior Marcello Mazzera, who was selected 
All-Pacific League last season after helping the Tornadoes to the league title. 
</P>
<P>
But Shirikjian is already being projected to be the best player to come out of 
the Glendale area by the time his high school career is complete. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best sophomore goalie I have ever seen," said Lancaster, an assistant 
for three years at Muir and head coach for seven years at Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Shirikjian gained recognition last summer when he was named All-American at the 
Junior Olympics in Long Beach after helping the USC-based Trojan club team to a 
second-place finish in the 15-and-under division. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament featured some of the most talented age-group players in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised when I got the award," Shirikjian said. "But I didn't say, 
'Well, I guess I must be the best.' I just kept going. There's a lot of things 
I need to work on." 
</P>
<P>
Shirikjian's most obvious weak point is a self-critical attitude that sometimes 
causes him to lose concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"When I have bad games, it's because the other team scores a goal and I don't 
tell myself, 'It's OK, try harder next time,' " Shirikjian said. "I get all mad 
at myself and let that break down my attitude for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting better at it though, I'm overcoming it." 
</P>
<P>
Shirikjian is already an aggressive and burgeoning shot-blocker. 
</P>
<P>
"Most goalies stay in the cage with the attitude, 'That's our home, we're not 
coming out,' " said Petrossian, the Dynamiters' leading scorer. "But Vatche 
will come out four or five yards and steal the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's also an excellent passer. He puts the ball right there, like money in the 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
After this season, Shirikjian will juggle his time between school, swimming for 
the Glendale team and practicing three times a week at USC with his club team. 
</P>
<P>
It's a commitment that drains Shirikjian's energy, but not his desire to one 
day play in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
"After I was in the cage a little while and started improving, I wanted to be 
the Olympic goalie. If I sit on my butt and say, 'Oh, I'm not quick enough, or 
I can't do this or that," I'll never get there."

GOVERNOR VETOES AIRPORT BILL EXEMPTING COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday rejected legislation that would have exempted 
Los Angeles County from a law designed to control growth around the state's 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, county planners have until 1992 to fashion comprehensive 
land-use plans to ensure that commercial and residential development around Los 
Angeles International Airport and the county's other airports -- including 
those in La Verne, El Monte and Burbank -- are compatible with flight safety 
and noise control regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Those supporting the bill to exempt the county from this requirement argued 
that such plans are unnecessary because land around most local airports already 
is densely developed. 
</P>
<P>
But in vetoing the bill Tuesday, Deukmejian said, "Without such planning, 
airports and the businesses surrounding them may be forced to close as 
development encroaches" because the increasing population would put airports in 
violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's action is the latest twist in a controversy that surfaced in 
1989 after Deukmejian signed a bill to put teeth into a 20-year-old requirement 
for land-use planning around airports statewide. That measure prompted an 
outcry from a number of Los Angeles County cities complaining that their 
planning authority around airports would be usurped by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption proposal was introduced by Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan 
Beach), who earlier this year successfully shepherded legislation that gives 
Los Angeles County an extra six months to comply with the law. But in vetoing 
Beverly's follow-up bill, Deukmejian said he would not allow the law to be 
eased any more. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy Leland -- a lobbyist for Los Angeles County, which pushed for passage of 
the exemption measure -- said he was unsure if the proposal will be revived 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Leland complained that the current law is "so vague, so general, it doesn't 
tell you what you are supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Other critics of the current law have argued that Los Angeles County's Regional 
Planning Commission, designated by state law as the airport planning agency, 
does not have the staff to handle the workload involved in planning around 
airports.

SAN MARINO MONEY CRUNCH EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your news story about the plight of the San Marino public schools 
(Times, Sept. 20), let me cite another small example of how the financial 
crisis has had a negative effect on the quality of life in the local area. 
</P>
<P>
About a decade ago, the school system installed a superior lighting system for 
the San Marino high school tennis courts, and those courts have provided 
innumerable recreational opportunities for citizens over the years. 
</P>
<P>
But for over six months, the lights on one of the five courts have been 
completely dark; a few bulbs on the other courts that burned out more than two 
years ago have likewise never been replaced. In other words, the school 
district is so strapped for money that it does not even have the loose change 
necessary to replace a few light bulbs on its deteriorating tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
I have complained to school officials in writing on two occasions but with no 
favorable response to date -- just one phone call from someone in the 
maintenance department stating that there were insufficient funds in the 
current budget to repair the damage.

HIGH SCHOOLS: CULVER CITY HIGH'S HEINEMAN AND SANTA MONICA HIGH'S NISHIMURA 
EXCEL ON FOOTBALL FIELD, IN CLASSROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The term student-athlete is a misnomer much of the time, but not in the cases 
of Rick Heineman and Zack Nishimura. 
</P>
<P>
Heineman, a Culver City High senior, and Nishimura, a Santa Monica High junior, 
play varsity football and baseball. Like many other high school athletes, they 
would like to earn athletic scholarships to universities, and they dream of 
playing professional sports one day. 
</P>
<P>
But neither dwells in his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they worked hard, have high grade-point averages, and seem capable of 
earning a good living outside of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Nishimura, who plays quarterback and defensive back in football and is a center 
fielder in baseball, said his GPA is 3.96 (on a four-point scale). Heineman, a 
tight end and linebacker who is also a baseball catcher, said his average is 
between 3.7 and 3.8. 
</P>
<P>
Both take college-level, advanced placement courses, Heineman is enrolled in a 
peer counseling class, and Nishimura is active in student government. 
</P>
<P>
Tebb Kusserow is in his 17th year as Santa Monica coach and played football 
there. He said that in most other years, Nishimura's academic performance would 
make him an exception on the football team. But this year, he said, "we have 
five people who start who are about 3.8 (in their averages) or above. It's a 
throwback to the old days." 
</P>
<P>
Culver City's Lou Lichtl, in his third year as head coach and his 11th year of 
coaching at his alma mater, said that Heineman's academic prowess is unusual 
for one of the school's athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"How many kids do you have who excel in two sports (and in the classroom)?" 
Lichtl said. "We have a few exceptions like that, more than in the past, and I 
hope that will change." 
</P>
<P>
Heineman considers himself normal rather than exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
"School is school," he said. "I'd rather not be here most of the time, but you 
might as well make the best of it while you're here." 
</P>
<P>
He does that, but he said that he has received much encouragement from his 
parents and Lichtl, a former Culver High football player, to excel in the 
classroom. "Ever since I was young, there has always been a big push for me to 
get an education," Heineman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his mother, Kay, and his late grandmother, Pauline McDonald, 
stressed the value of education. That seemed a natural thing for them to do, 
since they both were teachers at a nursery school owned by his grandfather, 
Dennis McDonald. His mother is the nursery school director and teaches 
kindergarten there. 
</P>
<P>
Heineman's athletic ability and his desire to play sports in college might come 
from his father, Richard, a veteran lieutenant lifeguard who used to swim for 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Heineman said that Lichtl has also "been making a big push for academics," 
asking brighter students to tutor their teammates or telling players to "ask 
for help if needed." 
</P>
<P>
Nishimura said that his parents and coaches have also encouraged him to do well 
in school. Since his father, Frank, teaches government at Santa Monica High and 
coaches football at the freshman and sophomore levels, he is able to give his 
son double-barreled encouragement. Frank Nishimura also played football for 
Santa Monica High. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Nishimura said that he played freshman football for his father and 
that it was "natural for him to press hard because he's my father. Sometimes 
you could tell he was mad at me, but it wasn't anything about coaching. He was 
my father, wanting me to do well." 
</P>
<P>
When he was younger, he said, his father and mother, Marilyn, a telephone 
company executive, used to do "more pushing. Now they really don't have to 
because I know what's best for me in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, Nishimura has stepped into a pressure situation in football. 
He started at quarterback in the first two games after last year's top passer, 
Bob Aylsworth, moved to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Was he nervous about his first varsity start at quarterback? It didn't show in 
his performance as he threw touchdown passes in a 29-20 victory over Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
He was glad to get the chance to play quarterback, he said, but he was also 
"nervous because he did not expect it" when practices began this year. He loves 
"just being out there on the field," particularly on defense, "which is really 
a lot of fun. You can be far more aggressive at safety than at quarterback. 
It's fun hitting people instead of getting hit." 
</P>
<P>
Nishimura said that he prefers football to baseball, where he hit about .325 
last year and started in center field as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around football much longer, and it's more fun than baseball," 
Nishimura said. "Baseball is more mental. Football is much faster, but it takes 
a lot out of you." 
</P>
<P>
It takes enough out of him that he sometimes falls asleep over his homework, 
but he wouldn't want to give up sports. 
</P>
<P>
"If I only had school, I would get bored," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heineman started for the varsity baseball team as a freshman, which rarely 
happens on most high school teams. Not only does he play baseball during the 
spring and football in the summer and fall, he also plays baseball on Saturdays 
in the fall, either in pickup games run by major league scouts or for a team of 
prep players sponsored by the Chicago Cubs. He said that he often feels stiff 
and sore when he plays baseball the day after a Friday night football game. 
</P>
<P>
He demonstrated his versatility last week when he made his first start at 
quarterback for the varsity in a 38-0 victory over Salesian. Filling in for 
injured quarterback Dameron Ricketts, he rushed for two touchdowns and 
completed four of eight passes for 42 yards. He also is the team's punter. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Heineman not only played baseball and football in a high school 
passing league and lifted weights at school, but he also worked as a pool 
lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
Does being on the go ever get to him? "I definitely get tired," he said, 
especially since he tries to keep up a social life as well. 
</P>
<P>
"But those are some of the sacrifices you have to make to stay in shape. You 
have to keep working out and try and get better." 
</P>
<P>
Nishimura said that football takes a lot out of him and there are nights when 
he comes home after practice so tired that the last thing he wants to think 
about is studying. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always really tired (on nights after school)," he said. "I take a shower, 
eat dinner, and all the time I'm dozing off over my book. I wake up and wonder 
where my place was. Sometimes I have to catch up on weekends."

PLAN CALLS FOR 2 NEW HOSPITALS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: OFFICIALS RECOMMEND THAT THE DECAYING LOS ANGELES COUNTY-USC MEDICAL 
CENTER BE REPLACED BY A STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County health officials want to replace the venerable but decaying 
Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center with two new hospitals, one on the 
current site and a second, smaller facility in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The formal recommendation, which would cost an estimated $1.8 billion if 
implemented, is being reviewed by the county's chief administrative officer. It 
calls for the project to be financed through a series of bond measures 
beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds, which would require property tax increases, also would pay for other 
improvements throughout the county's huge network of hospitals and neighborhood 
clinics, facilities that primarily serve the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon said he plans to forward the 
master plan -- with his recommendation that it be approved -- to the 
supervisors for a decision within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling County-USC Medical Center, a four-hospital complex whose central 
facility, the General Hospital, opened in 1932, has a paradoxical reputation 
for decrepit conditions and quality care. The center's wards, hallways and 
waiting rooms teem with impoverished patients. Rooms lack air conditioning or 
other amenities, and the older portions of the facility readily reveal their 
age in cracks and outdated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
County-USC also has come to be known nationally as a top teaching hospital, 
having trained thousands of still loyal doctors and nurses. For many of the 
county's sick poor, especially Latinos, it is the only hospital they know. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great fondness for this hospital," said Harvey Kern, special 
assistant to County-USC's executive director. At the same time, he said, 
medical staff and patients look forward to a state-of-the-art medical facility 
-- with air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Replacement of County-USC has been studied for years, but the matter gained 
urgency after federal officials threatened to cut off funds unless the county 
corrected fire hazards. Recently, the nation's major hospital review 
organization put County-USC on conditional accreditation, citing fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The master plan was prepared by a team of private consultants. 
</P>
<P>
It maintains that the medical center could operate more efficiently if it were 
replaced by a 946-bed facility. County-USC has 2,045 licensed beds, but only 
1,398 are in use. Under the proposal, the 20-story General Hospital, whose 
edifice is known to soap opera buffs as the exterior prop for the show "General 
Hospital," would remain for academic and research use. 
</P>
<P>
The master plan proposes scaling down County-USC to "more evenly distribute 
medical care throughout the county." Under the plan, the number of beds in the 
hospital system would remain the same but less at County-USC and more in other 
regions of the county. 
</P>
<P>
It calls for a 350-bed hospital to be built somewhere in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the proposal would add 100 beds each at Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center in Torrance and Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said that having projects in each supervisorial district is politically 
crucial, intended to help secure the support of both supervisors and, 
eventually, voters. 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure would increase property taxes on a home assessed at $250,000 
by $37 in the first year, increasing to $55 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
The master plan concludes that it would be more economical to build a hospital 
than repair County-USC to meet fire and earthquake safety standards. 
"Functional obsolescence of the existing hospitals also lead the consultant 
team to determine that replacement would yield greater operational efficiencies 
than remodeling," the study says. 
</P>
<P>
The county is spending $500,000 a year for a 24-hour fire watch in which 
employees walk the halls of the 20-story main building looking for fires and 
potentially hazardous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Because the complex is so spread out, with more than 100 buildings dotting the 
Lincoln Heights site just east of downtown, patients sometimes have to be 
transported by ambulance half a block from one medical facility to another. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site for the new County-USC is east of General Hospital. Plans 
call for completion of the facility in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
County health director Robert Gates said that building a new hospital would not 
necessarily reduce crowding or long waits at County-USC. But he said that a new 
hospital would make visits to County-USC more pleasant. For example, he said, 
the existing hospital has as many as six patients in a ward. The master plans 
calls for single-occupancy rooms, although Gates said there could be two 
patients in each room. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the current proposal, dramatic changes loom for County-USC. A 
275-bed hospital is being built near County-USC by the university and National 
Medical Enterprises Inc. The new teaching hospital, scheduled to open in May, 
1991, will primarily serve paying patients, a sharp departure from the medical 
center's traditional clientele. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley hospital would serve patients who now travel to 
County-USC. No decision has been made on a site but the region's supervisor, 
Pete Schabarum, favors Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon and Gates said this week they will also recommend that supervisors 
approve improvements to other county hospitals and neighborhood clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed projects include construction of a larger trauma center at Martin 
Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center in South Central Los Angeles, expansion of 
the emergency room at Harbor-UCLA, expansion of the perinatal unit at Olive 
View, construction of a perinatal unit at High Desert Hospital in Lancaster and 
fire and seismic safety improvements at several hospitals and neighborhood 
clinics.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-HEAD OF TOXIC WASTE FIRM GUILTY IN 
DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal jury convicted the former president of a toxic waste treatment 
company Wednesday for illegally transporting more than 400 drums of hazardous 
waste and dumping them at a defunct mill in a small Nevada town. 
</P>
<P>
Following a two-week trial in Los Angeles, Michael Robert Speach was convicted 
of 15 environmental crimes stemming from the dumping of the 55-gallon drums at 
Monarch Milling Co. in Austin, Nev., in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Speach, 66, faces a maximum sentence of 75 years in prison and fines exceeding 
$10 million when he is sentenced Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the crimes, Speach was president of ENV Inc. of Rancho 
Dominguez, which treated electroplating waste for disposal. Prosecutors said 
the company now performs tests on toxic material.

KIDNAPING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of kidnaping his estranged wife from her Santa Monica office 
was arrested Wednesday after he walked into the local police station arm and 
arm with the woman, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Howie, 30, was booked for investigation of kidnaping and felony spousal 
abuse and held in lieu of $500,000 bail. Accompanied by two unidentified men, 
Howie allegedly went to the offices of Family Media on Ocean Park Boulevard on 
Tuesday, grabbed Mari Payne, 30, and left with her. 
</P>
<P>
After the couple was separated at the station Wednesday, Payne told officers 
she had been kidnaped, but her husband had told her to say she had accompanied 
him voluntarily, police said, adding that the woman had "bruises and cuts."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH TO CHALLENGE CENSUS IN ONLY 6 
BLOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach officials have decided to challenge the 1990 census count in only 
six blocks of the city, claiming that census takers missed 269 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The limited challenge surprised community workers, who had estimated that up to 
25,000 residents were overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the census count came within 0.3% of their estimates. 
However, officials acknowledged that Long Beach lacks the computer and 
record-keeping systems that would enable it to prove whether there was an 
undercount. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data showed population in Long Beach, the state's fifth-largest 
city, grew 17% in the last decade to 423,394.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTIES SEIZE 8 GALLONS OF PCP, ARREST 
SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was arrested and sheriff's deputies seized about 8 gallons of the 
potent hallucinogenic drug PCP worth about $85,000 in a raid on a Willowbrook 
home, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy John Ashley said a gang enforcement team on routine patrol smelled the 
drug's characteristic strong odor along the 2000 block of East 130th Street 
about 11:45 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies noticed one suspect carrying two one-quart beer bottles and a 
second suspect fled on foot as the officers got out of their patrol car. The 
bottles smelled of PCP, Ashley said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies searched the house and found the drug in two 5-gallon gasoline cans. 
The house apparently was not being lived in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Anderson, 24, of Lynwood, was arrested on suspicion of manufacturing and 
possession of PCP. He was held in lieu of $100,000 bail. The second suspect was 
being sought, Ashley said.

SCHABARUM BLASTS DEAL WITH RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent deal to keep the Raiders playing in the Los Angeles Coliseum has 
been blasted by Supervisor Pete Schabarum, a member of the Coliseum Commission 
who was out of town and did not vote on the commission's part of the agreement 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to commission President Matthew Grossman released Wednesday, 
Schabarum charged that in agreeing to dismiss its $58-million lawsuit against 
the Raiders as part of the deal, the commission had relinquished "a fundamental 
item of benefit" without getting any guarantee that a $145-million Coliseum 
renovation will actually go forward. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the commission had voted to dismiss the suit without having 
been told the contents of the agreement between its private management, the 
Spectacor Limited Partnership, and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"If the stadium renovations are not accomplished, and the commission is left 
without a developer and/or National Football League tenant, or recourse against 
either, the commission and those who voted to dismiss the lawsuit will surely 
deserve the shame and embarrassment that will focus on the commission at that 
time," Schabarum wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, after reading the letter, said in an interview that the commission 
had no alternative, if it was going to secure the Raiders, to agreeing to 
dismiss the lawsuit. "I remain firmly believing that the decision will serve 
the community very well in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Schabarum complained that the Coliseum's private managers never 
tell the commission about the contents of any of the deals they make for use of 
the Coliseum by teams, concert promoters or others. 
</P>
<P>
In the Raiders' case, in particular, with 20 years of Coliseum use potentially 
at stake, this policy prevents the commission from "properly analyzing the 
adequacy of its end of the bargain," the supervisor wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Spectacor chief Ed Snider and Raiders officials have repeatedly said the deal 
they made will remain secret, although some details, such as its term, the 
amount and date of certain advance payments totaling $32 million, have been 
disclosed by Bradley Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum has been a critic for a decade of arrangements of the move of the 
Raiders to Los Angeles from Oakland.

ASSOCIATE OF SPORTS SHOW ORGANIZER DENIES WRONGDOING; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: THE MAIN PROMOTER OF A PASADENA MEMORABILIA CONVENTION REMAINS 
AT LARGE AFTER ALLEGEDLY BILKING CELEBRITIES AND BUSINESSES OF $100,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
One of the organizers of a recent Pasadena sports memorabilia show that led to 
allegations that sports celebrities and small businesses were bilked of more 
than $100,000 said Wednesday that he was not involved in any wrongdoing and did 
not know the whereabouts of the show's principal promoter, Ernest Dent. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia officials, meanwhile, said Dent was involved in a failed business 
venture that was accused of misusing federal and state job training funds in 
that state. And, they said, they believe Dent's real name is Paul Whitlow. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Abbott, who helped Dent organize the show, said he was cooperating with 
the Pasadena Police Department, which is investigating circumstances 
surrounding the "Baseball Legends" show held at the Pasadena Center on Sept. 
7-9. 
</P>
<P>
Several sports stars, including Mickey Mantle, Don Drysdale and Steve Garvey, 
have said they agreed to appear at the show and sign autographs but were paid 
with checks that bounced. At least a dozen businesses say they have gone 
unpaid, and a number of collectors say valuable memorabilia has not been 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't involved in writing any bad checks," Abbott said by telephone from 
his home in West Virginia, adding: "Ernest Dent is gone. Nobody knows where he 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Dent's "Baseball Legends" office in Glendale was found abandoned two days after 
the show closed, and Pasadena Police Lt. Van Anthony said the department has 
not been able to locate the promoter for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony confirmed that Abbott had been in contact with Pasadena investigators. 
"He's maintaining he's totally innocent" but remains under investigation, 
Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
After the show, Abbott said, he returned to his home near Montgomery, W.Va. He 
said he first met Dent in 1987 or 1988, when Dent was involved in a now-defunct 
business in Montgomery that sought to install a network of privately owned 
coin-operated telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Dent became president of the company, West Virginia Pay Phone Systems, and was 
among company officials held responsible for the misuse of $9,200 in federal 
and state job training funds, said Paul Skaff, director of job training for 
West Virginia's Department of Employment Security. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been unable to collect the $9,200, and the state attorney general's 
office has been trying to track down Mr. Dent," Skaff said. 
</P>
<P>
Rolland Phillips, an official with the West Virginia governor's Office of 
Industrial Development, said the state had hoped the company would attract 
high-tech manufacturing, but then it went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was indicated to us Mr. Dent was probably not as honest as was believed," 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Dent's alleged use of an alias, Phillips said: "I was advised from 
people associated with the project that Ernest Dent was not a real name; that 
it, in fact, was an alias. His real name was Paul Whitlow. I have no idea where 
he's from." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena police said they were not aware of any alias. 
</P>
<P>
Another West Virginian involved in "Baseball Legends" was Harold (Dee) 
Lipscomb, who went by the name Dee Whitten, according to some who attended the 
Pasadena show. Lipscomb's mother said by phone Wednesday that her son was "in 
Kentucky looking for work." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott said he had "no idea" what happened to Dent or the show's proceeds. "I 
thought he would still be there," he said of the promoter. "The show did not go 
well, but I didn't expect him to leave. . . . I don't think Ernest left with a 
whole lot of money." Abbott declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
But dealers and others who attended the show said it was attended by large 
crowds. Pasadena fire officials said lines waiting to get into the Pasadena 
Center were so long by the show's second morning that they limited admissions.

SCHOOL TRIES TO REASSURE RESIDENTS ON GROWTH PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SOKA UNIVERSITY'S PROPOSALS WORRY SOME OF ITS CALABASAS NEIGHBORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Officials of tiny Soka University tried to reassure their Calabasas neighbors 
Wednesday night that concern for the environment would dominate their plans for 
a 5,000-student campus in what is now a serene meadow in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But the neighbors, who had been invited to the Mulholland Highway campus to 
hear details of the plans, remained skeptical that the proposed expansion from 
an 80-student language institute could preserve the mountain setting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to put my input in and say it's just too large," said Shirley Duryee 
who lives in nearby Montenito. "It's going to be too much impact on the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
The Toyko-based university announced last spring that it wanted to grow into a 
four-year liberal arts college in the next 25 years. In August, community 
concern grew after a spokesman disclosed that the university had purchased 332 
acres, bringing its total landholdings to nearly 600 acres. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined Wednesday, the university would grow in phases beginning soon with 
the addition of a Japanese language program, then becoming a two-year college 
in the year 2000 and continuing to grow incrementally until 2015. 
</P>
<P>
"The university is very much aware of the beauty and the environmental nature 
of this property," said Steve Davis, an architect hired by the university to 
design the expansion. "They have asked us to enhance the use of that 
environment by people." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, state and national parks officials have wanted to buy 
the site and turn it into a headquarters and visitors center for the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. They are continuing to look for 
government land suitable for a trade with the school. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, university administrators continued to express doubt that any 
other property would suit their needs. County records show they have paid 
nearly $56 million for the property, which some real estate attorneys and 
brokers estimate to be twice its market value. 
</P>
<P>
In response to many of the tougher questions asked, primarily concerning 
traffic, university officials said they would discuss alternatives with their 
board. Davis said possible solutions to congestion on Mulholland Highway could 
include van pools, parking permits and limiting university traffic to non-rush 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Soka University, which also runs a 6,000-student college in Tokyo and a 
language institute outside Paris, was founded by Soka Gakkai leader Daisaku 
Ikeda. Soka Gakkai is a neo-Buddhist sect that critics and ex-members liken to 
a cult. Its U.S. branch headquarters is in Santa Monica and is called Nichiren 
Shoshu of America (NSA). But on Wednesday night, Soka administrators distanced 
themselves from the sect, saying they have no legal or financial ties to it.

Authorities said there were no suspects in their investigation of vandalized 
Sacramento Union news racks, in which the newspaper's equipment has been 
smashed and plastered with stickers from a gay-rights group. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Gary Gregson said the investigation was continuing. He asked the 
public for assistance in identifying the vandals. The Union reported that 
nearly 50 machines -- valued at $450 each -- have been damaged since the 
weekend, and that stickers with the name of the AIDS-rights group ACT UP have 
been found on the racks. ACT UP stands for AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. 
Representatives of ACT UP did not answer their telephones.

SHADES OF GRAY: CROSSROADS; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IS IT TIME TO RELINQUISH THE KEYS AND STOP DRIVING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

living in Lake San Marcos.

<P>
Joe's driving record was without blemish. He wove his Mercedes in and out of 
the morning traffic with skill and cunning. For years, he met, successfully, 
the challenge of the freeways. But, as his health declined, Joe began to drive 
more slowly and grip the wheel more tightly. One day, he drove his car into the 
garden wall, the wall that he had not even grazed in 25 years. Reluctantly, Joe 
relinquished the keys to the car. His confidence was eroded and his sense of 
security shaken. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who have driven California highways comfortably for years would 
find it difficult to think about relinquishing our car keys. Nevertheless, some 
of us who are over 50, 60 or 70, recognize that we are gripping the wheel more 
tightly, moving more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Not every mature driver experiences this change. A neighbor who is past 80 
commutes from North County to Pasadena several times each week to visit family. 
"I drive the speed limit, it takes me two hours and fifteen minutes exactly . . 
. no problem!" 
</P>
<P>
She demonstrates the validity of the Department of Motor Vehicles' conclusion 
that older drivers do not constitute a "problem group," even though, on 
occasion, some slow or uncertain drivers cause fender-benders. 
</P>
<P>
The department understands the need of older drivers to keep driving. Each 
month, for example, the DMV goes to senior centers around the county, making 
driving tests convenient for those who need to renew their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Age is merely one factor to consider when assessing a driver's ability to 
perform safely, according to Arnold Cordova, DMV Operations Officer in 
Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of the rules of the road, the driver's good health and satisfactory 
handling of the car are vital considerations. For renewal, drivers must take an 
eye test, a written exam and, if a health problem has surfaced since the last 
renewal, must provide a written doctor's report. A license exam can be taken as 
many as three times. 
</P>
<P>
A poor performance in one area of the driving test does not automatically mean 
loss of license. If one fails the eye test, for example, the examiner will 
suggest a visit to an eye doctor and a return with a written assessment from 
that physician. 
</P>
<P>
Should an examiner observe a developing disability, such as a tremor or a lack 
of concentration, a medical check-up will be recommended. If a dramatic change 
in health is observed, a limited license is often issued, perhaps a renewal for 
one or two years, instead of four. 
</P>
<P>
The door to driving is not impulsively slammed shut by the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the decision to close the door is one that individuals must make 
themselves, as they sense their skills slipping. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, we "shades of gray" individuals are stubborn when the time comes to 
let someone else do the driving. We are unwilling to ask a family member or 
neighbor for a ride, or to take public transportation. We have our reasons: an 
empty garage is wasted space; it's inconvenient to arrange a ride. But when our 
faulty driving cannot be improved, the car becomes a lethal weapon, far more 
dangerous to well-being than what might be a boring day at home. 
</P>
<P>
A worried family member can request in writing that the DMV revoke the license 
of a elderly relative whose driving alertness appears to be failing. The DMV 
encourages family participation in what unfortunately is usually a painful 
process. 
</P>
<P>
When my father-in-law was past 80, he was increasingly uncomfortable behind the 
wheel of his car, but he was determined to continue to drive. His family, 
fearful of destroying his self-image and confidence, was not eager to confront 
his failing. But, we were all brought up sharply when an accident terrified him 
-- he quit before he killed or was killed. 
</P>
<P>
It is senseless to wait for accidents to make decisions. They can be fatal; 
they are always traumatic. 
</P>
<P>
The Auto Club and the American Assn. for Retired People work with older drivers 
as they reach crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
One does not have to be an Auto Club member to chat with a club counselor or 
receive brochures that focus on the concerns of mature drivers: "Am I Too Old 
to Drive?", "Safety Tips for Older Drivers" and "Pedestrian Safety Rules." 
</P>
<P>
These counselors can recommend refresher courses for mature drivers' who have 
difficulty passing DMV exams or have become uncomfortable behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Weisen of the American Assn. for Retired People said the organization's 
"55 is Alive" program provides a two-day driving course that sharpens driving 
skills and driver alertness. (For information, call 455-1049.) 
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, more than a million drivers have participated in "55 
is Alive." 
</P>
<P>
In North County, the oldest person to have taken the course is 92. When that 
gentleman completed the road test, his examiner wrote, "He is a fine student, a 
better driver than the most competent youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
License renewal and driving pose knotty problems for many mature drivers, but, 
the knots can be untangled. 
</P>
<P>
And the list of alternatives to driving is substantial: one can take a bus, 
call Dial-a-Ride or Lifeline, seek hospital-provided transportation, ask a 
friend, walk, call a cab, take the train. The Auto Club encourages older 
drivers to consider bus trips and will help plan such trips, or even create a 
club-sponsored tour. 
</P>
<P>
Fun does not have to disappear with the car keys.

BEING TAKEN FOR A RIDE;

<P>
THE PUSH TO HELP COMMUTERS STEER CLEAR OF SOLO DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Tony Graziano deftly maneuvers his 1989 Dodge van through the morning crush 
on Interstate 5 south, his 14 passengers talk, read, listen to the radio, sleep 
or get a jump on their work. They are oblivious to the mass of frustrated 
motorists inching along outside the sanctuary of their van-pool. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano considers it a personal compliment when his passengers pursue the 
activities they couldn't if they were driving alone in their own cars. He beams 
proudly when someone falls asleep on the ride to work or home. 
</P>
<P>
"It means that they put all their trust into me," said the Carlsbad resident, 
who's been navigating this van-pool from Oceanside to Sorrento Valley since 
February. "No matter what, with all the things that go wrong, the speeding up, 
the slowing down, they can sleep through all that, and that gives me a good 
feeling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano, a hardware engineer for Calma, a software and systems design firm, 
volunteered to be a van-pool driver after the North City Transportation 
Management Assn. surveyed his company and found it to be an ideal candidate for 
a ride-share program. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the benefits of helping alleviate freeway congestion and air pollution, 
Graziano liked the idea of getting a free ride to and from work and saving wear 
and tear on his personal vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano makes three stops along the I-5 corridor, picking up employees of 
neighboring Sorrento Valley businesses and depositing them at their work site 
by 7:30 a.m. He reverses the process at 4 p.m. Because of his efforts, there 
are 14 fewer cars on the freeway during rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of ride-sharing that organizations like Caltrans, Commuter 
Computer, transportation management associations and environmental groups are 
working to make happen. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, transportation groups in North County and around the state hope to 
enlighten the public about the benefits of ride-sharing and the alternatives to 
driving alone. Rideshare Week '90 sponsors include the North City 
Transportation Management Assn. and the North County Transportation Management 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The groups hope to encourage people to car-pool, van-pool, jog, walk, bike, bus 
or skate to work, thereby lessening traffic on the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
To heighten interest, several community activities have been planned and prizes 
will be awarded to companies with the most ride-sharers during the first week 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
Getting into the spirit, Mayor Lee Thibadeau of San Marcos has challenged the 
other mayors along the Highway 78 corridor to see who can get the highest 
percentage of city employees to ride-share during the week. The mayors of 
Escondido, Oceanside, Vista and Carlsbad have all accepted the challenge and 
the North County Transportation Management Assn. will tally up the winners. 
</P>
<P>
Rideshare Week sponsors are quick to point out that it will take more than five 
days of community effort to solve the problems of traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, traffic has increased by 55% since 1980, but the miles of new road 
construction have increased less than 2% in the same period. Two-thirds of the 
existing roads are in "fair to very poor condition," and the cost of improving 
them is estimated at $8.6 billion, according to Californians for Better 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Other statistics about commuting and polluting from the North County 
Transportation Management Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
* Each California driver wastes about 43 gallons of fuel each year in traffic 
jams. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1988, California drivers spent about 1.19 billion hours stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Cars generate 85% of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Why does more than 80% of the commuting population choose to drive alone, 
despite soaring gas prices and miles-long traffic jams? 
</P>
<P>
Fred Mrak, executive director of the North County Transportation Assn., which 
covers the Highway 78 corridor, says ride-sharing requires a change in people's 
lifestyles, something not many Southern Californians are willing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go into the East or Midwest, you always hear people say, 'People in 
Southern California are in love with their cars.' We are not in love with our 
cars, we are in love with our lifestyle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Southern California think nothing of driving 50 miles to see a 
friend. They would never do that back East. If we (Southern California) could 
provide good mass transit, where we could walk out the front door, get on a bus 
that is on time, safe and something we could have confidence in, we would get 
out of our cars as readily as anyone else," Mrak said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts and commuters agree that it can be more time consuming to ride-share 
than to drive alone. There are additional stops for other passengers and 
schedules must be adjusted to precisely match that of fellow commuters. Fear 
that they will lose time has kept a number of people from trying ride-sharing, 
according to Commuter Computer, a driver/passenger matching program connected 
with the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
But, as fast-moving car-pool lanes become more common, the time advantage they 
give ride-sharers is expected to make up for the extra time spent picking up 
and dropping off passengers, according to Manuel Demetre of Commuter Computer. 
</P>
<P>
The state plans to expand the high occupancy vehicle network on I-5 and to 
eventually extend to Escondido the diamond lane on Interstate 15, Demetre said. 
Additionally, there will be metering on most on-ramps, which gives car-pools 
the first go-ahead to get on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Inconvenience and loss of freedom is another concern of potential ride-sharers, 
said Ann Dash, executive director of the North City Transportation Management 
Assn. The association covers the Golden Triangle, North City, Torrey Pines and 
the La Jolla Village Drive corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Some people worry that if they car- or van-pool, they will not be able to run 
errands on their breaks or be able to get somewhere fast in the event of an 
emergency, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of biggest fears a car-pooler has is that they will get stranded. Driving 
is considered a personal freedom, and encouraging people to use some other mode 
of transportation without limiting their freedom at all is an uphill battle," 
Dash said. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating this mind-set, the North City Transportation Management Assn. has 
developed several programs to increase a ride-sharer's freedom. The Emergency 
Ride Home program is one such option. 
</P>
<P>
"In the event of an emergency, our members can contact us and we will get a cab 
to them within 10 minutes and take that person either to the emergency, to the 
home or to where their vehicle is at no charge," Dash said. "We have a contract 
with La Jolla Cab Co. where we pick up the cost, so our members can get home 
and it's not going to cost them an arm and a leg." 
</P>
<P>
The North City association is also planning a concierge service, providing 
dry-cleaning and cobbler service for people who van-pool. 
</P>
<P>
Another barrier associated with car-pooling is fear of having contact with a 
stranger, said Demetre. Commuter Computer tries to alleviate that concern by 
providing interested car-poolers with lists of people who work in the same 
company or who live nearby and have similar work schedules. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious benefit of ride-sharing is financial savings, Demetre said. 
The single commuter has no one helping defray the expense of gasoline, vehicle 
maintenance, and parking. In North County, there are express bus lines that 
leave from park-and-ride lots in Oceanside, Escondido and Poway and go into 
downtown San Diego. A monthly pass for one of these 45-seater, coach-type buses 
is about $65 -- cheaper than it would be just to pay for a parking space 
downtown, Demetre said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tony Graziano's van-pool, a monthly pass costs about $69. Participants can 
take advantage of tax credits provided by the state and write off 40% of that 
cost. Recently, the North City Transportation Management Assn. was approved for 
a van-pool acquisition grant, which will help defray the cost of leasing a van, 
and that savings will be passed along to the riders, Graziano said. 
</P>
<P>
"Out-of-pocket expense will drop about $20 just because of the grant," he said. 
"Then, if a person takes advantage of the tax credit, they can really be riding 
for as low as $27 a month, and there is no way your can drive your own car for 
$27 anywhere in San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
Other benefits to ride-sharing: free flowing freeways, cleaner air to breathe, 
reduced stress. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Ragsdale, a junior programmer for HomeFed Bank, who lives in Rancho San 
Diego and commutes with a co-worker to Sorrento Valley, said in the past year 
he has cut his fuel bill by about one third, but his stress level has decreased 
even more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great. When you have that person to converse with, it's real 
therapeutic," Ragsdale said. "If I'm frustrated, we talk about it. I get a lot 
of help from him just from the car-pool time." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Mrak says that ride-sharing is not a popular issue, but it has gained much 
more attention in the last few years. Like increased awareness of smoking and 
healthy eating habits, ride-sharing is becoming a social, environmental and 
health issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Stress is the No. 1 killer," Mrak said. "That solo driver is not helping the 
high blood pressure or health of the general public." 
</P>
<P>
"We (the Transportation Management Assn.) have no ax to grind," Mrak said. "We 
just want to make this a better place for our families and children."

BOONE WANTS TO RECONSTRUCT BASEBALL CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that he has achieved his near-impossible dream, Dan Boone has one more goal 
for this year. 
</P>
<P>
He would like to get his winter job back. And not the one with the construction 
gang back in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Boone (who prefers Dan to Daniel, as opposed to his pioneering uncle of seven 
generations ago), used the newly formed Senior League as his return ticket to 
the major leagues. The irony now is that he might need permission to go back. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is set, and I definitely want to go back," Boone said. "I think 
it's just a matter of the club giving permission." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what the situation is with active players," said Doug Melvin, the 
Orioles' player personnel director. "But we do have a memo from the 
commissioner's office that they be notified before permission is granted. If 
there is no objection, I'm sure we'd give him permission." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, it's premature to say that Boone will be on the Orioles' 40-man 
roster, which doesn't have to be set until Nov. 20. And there is only one 
precedent in this situation: Ken Griffey Sr. wanted to play in the Senior 
League last year, but the Cincinnati Reds wouldn't give him permission. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't likely to happen with Boone and the Orioles, and not just because 
the left-hander still ranks somewhere between a novelty and a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely should pitch some more," said Melvin. "In fact, we talked to him 
about playing for (Rochester Manager) Greg Biagini in the Dominican Republic. 
But his preference is to stay in the states so he could be with his family." 
</P>
<P>
Boone will be 37 before another season rolls around, and if the Orioles' farm 
system is as replete with talent as they think, he might have a tough time 
staying on the 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons these final games are so important -- to help you 
make those kind of decisions," said General Manager Roland Hemond. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday night, Boone had pitched four scoreless innings in two 
appearances with the Orioles since his recent promotion from Rochester. "Any 
left-hander who can get hitters out intrigues you," said Manager Frank 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Has Boone given indication that he can do that against major-league hitters? 
"He's gotten them out so far," said Robinson. "Whether he can do that over 70 
innings or so, it's tough to tell right now. He looks like he has the stuff to 
get hitters out, but I think he'd be most effective getting him in and out, 
maybe one time through the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
That would seem to squash Boone's dream of being a starter, but at this stage 
of his career any role is OK. And this winter a baseball job is the most 
financially attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"I can make more money playing down there than I can working construction," 
Boone said of the Senior League. "I don't want to go back to working 
construction, and I don't think the Orioles would want me to either." 
</P>
<P>
That's what Boone was doing a year ago, when a phone call from Clete Boyer 
changed his life. "He told me he needed some pitching and asked me if I wanted 
to come to Florida," said Boone, who lives in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Boone doesn't look like a candidate for a construction gang or a big-league 
team, standing 5-feet-8 (on tiptoe) and weighing 139 pounds. But he has a body 
similar to Cal Ripken Sr. -- sort of like a wrought iron stake. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the only reason I'm here is because of the knuckleball, and the fact 
that you can throw it for a long time," said Boone, who was "discovered" in the 
Senior League by Orioles scout Birdie Tebbetts.

38 DAYS LATER, TIGHT SPOT WINS THE DEL MAR DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a highly unusual decision that has triggered strong reactions, the 
California Horse Racing Board overruled a judgment call by three of its veteran 
stewards and gave the $300,000 Del Mar Derby back to Tight Spot, the original 
winner who was disqualified for alleged interference. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow!" was the immediate reaction of Ron McAnally, Tight Spot's trainer, 
Wednesday when informed of the CHRB's vote to accept the recommendation of 
attorney Steven Schwartz, who served as the appeal hearing referee. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years of training, I can't recall a racing board overruling the 
stewards like this," said McAnally, who had urged the owners of Tight Spot to 
appeal the disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
The vote among the seven commissioners was 6-0. CHRB Executive Secretary Dennis 
Hutcheson had not yet received the vote of Commissioner John LaFollette when he 
released the ruling Wednesday morning, but a simple majority was all that was 
required. 
</P>
<P>
In horse racing, the board of stewards holds power comparable to that of 
referees and umpires in other sports. There have been ruling reversals before, 
but they have been few. None has occurred in a California race comparable to 
the Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Tight Spot, a 3-year-old colt owned by Verne Winchell, Frank Whitham, Frank 
Anderson and Rick Corradini, won the 1 1/8-mile grass race by three lengths 
over Jheri Redding's Itsallgreektome on Aug. 19 at Del Mar. However, stewards 
Hubert Jones, Morton Lipton and David Samuel held Tight Spot at fault for 
severe crowding that took place about 100 yards after the start. One horse hit 
the rail and another almost fell. 
</P>
<P>
Tight Spot, who chipped a knee in the race, was placed last in the field of 10 
after a seven-minute inquiry. The Derby was awarded to runner-up 
Itsallgreektome, ridden by Russell Baze and trained by Wallace Dollase, and 
Tight Spot's jockey, Laffit Pincay, was suspended for five days. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally and Tight Spot's owners maintained that Pincay was merely following 
the same line as Pro for Sure, the colt immediately to his left, as Tight Spot 
led the Derby field down the turf chute toward the grandstand. Attorney Arthur 
Martin, acting for the Tight Spot group, presented testimony from six witnesses 
who either saw Pro for Sure as the actual culprit or simply could not untangle 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis, Pro for Sure's jockey, was the only witness presented by the 
stewards, who were represented by Lipton. 
</P>
<P>
Dollase was present at the appeal and did not like what he heard. The decision 
means a difference in $125,000 between first and second place. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not impressed," Dollase said. "The stewards did not present a good case, 
and they were supposedly representing the state. I maintained all along that 
both horses should have been disqualified, and now neither has been penalized." 
</P>
<P>
Pro for Sure had been moved from fourth to third when Tight Spot was 
disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Dollase confirmed that he and owner Redding would seek legal advice to 
challenge the decision of the CHRB. 
</P>
<P>
The comments of Schwartz would seem to support Dollase's contention that the 
stewards were lax in the defense of their decision. In his summary of the 
hearing, Schwartz called the testimony of Solis "conflicted" as to whether or 
not Tight Spot actually committed any crowding. Furthermore, Schwartz was 
swayed by the testimony of retired jockey Bill Harmatz, whose analysis of the 
race videotapes leveled the blame on Pro for Sure. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, who is serving in the stewards' stand at Fairplex Park, questioned the 
qualifications of Schwartz to analyze the evidence and to make such a sweeping 
recommendation to the racing commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time they have somebody who doesn't know how to read films making 
decisions on people who have close to 100 years doing it, that's a bad system," 
Samuel said. "I think all the trainers, owners, jockeys and stewards in this 
state had better be concerned about it." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel stood by his initial ruling that Tight Spot caused the crowding. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a fairly simple call at the time and I still do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, reached at his Los Angeles law offices, replied that it was not his 
job to "make an independent determination as to who should or should not be 
disqualified." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, who like all stewards is a state employee, was asked if he considered 
the CHRB action a vote of no-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not really," he replied. "But I'd sure like to know their thinking. This 
is the only sport I know where judgment calls are overturned." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the call by the stewards affected a betting pool of $1.8 million 
that included win, place, show, exacta, triple and late-double wagering. Tight 
Spot and Silver Ending, coupled as an entry, were 11-10 favorites, while 
Itsallgreektome was the 4-1 second choice. The original mutuel payoffs will 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Also at stake was a first-place purse of $165,000 and secondary awards of 
$60,000, $40,000, $22,500 and $7,500. The money was not paid out, pending the 
results of the appeal. The horses will now revert to their original finish 
order. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel vindicated," said Winchell, who bred Tight Spot and owns 50% of the 
colt.

STUBBS GETS 6 RBIS TO HIT THE DODGERS WHERE IT HURTS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE HAS A THREE-RUN HOME RUN AND THREE-RUN DOUBLE TO LEAD THE ASTROS 
PAST HIS FORMER TEAMMATES, 10-1. L.A. FALLS 4 1/2 GAMES BEHIND REDS.

<P>
Contrary to popular baseball opinion, it does not always take a full season to 
evaluate the results of a trade. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it can be done in two at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Stubbs to the Houston Astros for Terry Wells? Wednesday night that 
trade helped push the Dodgers a step further away from the division title. 
</P>
<P>
A revenge-minded Stubbs stunned his former teammates by hitting a three-run 
home run and three-run double in leading the Astros to a 10-1 victory before 
13,790 at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with a 5-2 victory by the National League West-leading Cincinnati Reds 
over Atlanta, the loss dropped the Dodgers to 4 1/2 games out of first place 
with six games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Any combination of Reds' victories and Dodgers' losses equaling three would 
officially eliminate the Dodgers. That moment could come as soon as Friday 
night, when the Dodgers play in San Francisco while the Reds are host to the 
San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be a moment too soon for first baseman-outfielder Stubbs, who was 
traded April 1 because the Dodgers did not think he could hit left-handed 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
His homer in the fifth inning came against left-handed reliever Jim Poole. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I get a little pumped up against the Dodgers, playing them will always be 
special," said Stubbs, who had seven hits in 12 at-bats in this three-game 
series, with three homers and eight runs batted in. "It's for the simple reason 
that they told me I couldn't do this, and I couldn't do that. I guess I'm 
showing them I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
And how he's rubbing it in. He has more homers (six) and RBIs (15) against the 
Dodgers this year then he had all of last season, when injuries limited him to 
four homers and 15 RBIs. Overall, he has 22 homers and 68 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I play against them, I am going to try and play this way," Stubbs 
said. "People over there know why I am playing that way, and I'll just leave it 
at that." 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs wasn't the only one responsible for the Astros' victory. 
</P>
<P>
Astro starter Jim Deshaies, who is 7-0 in 11 games against the Dodgers in the 
Astrodome, pitched a four-hitter. Deshaies walked two and struck out a 
season-high nine. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Dodgers could not bring themselves to give Stubbs complete 
credit for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda was more upset with starting pitcher Mike Morgan, who lasted only 
five batters, his worst performance of the season in his biggest start of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan started the game with walks to Craig Biggio, Karl Rhodes and Glenn 
Davis, sandwiched around a double-play grounder that was botched by Juan Samuel 
and Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded, Morgan fell behind Stubbs in the count, 3-and-1, then 
Stubbs lined a ball down the first base line to clear the bases. Morgan was 
immediately removed from the game, eventually losing for the sixth time in his 
last eight decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan is still tied for the major league lead in shutouts with four, but he 
hasn't had a shutout since July 14. He is 11-15 with a 3.67 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the heck happened to him," Lasorda said of Morgan. "Franklin 
is an outstanding guy but . . . if you don't make the right pitches, this is 
what kind of hitter he can be. We made him look like a star." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said Poole made Stubbs shine even brighter in the fifth, with the score 
3-0. After walking Biggio and intentionally walking Davis with two out, Stubbs 
lined a 1-and-1 pitch over the right-field fence in a spot similar to his two 
other homers this series. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid came in and hung a slider . . . you hang those pitches, they are the 
kind that sit up there and say, 'Hit me, hit me,' " Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Poole of the pitch: "It was a like a flying saucer going up there. He hit 
it and I didn't even have to look. You can't make a mistake like that to normal 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Those who thought the hit would change Lasorda's opinion about Stubbs' ability 
against left-handers were wrong. Two innings later, Lasorda intentionally 
walked Davis again and brought in left-hander Dave Walsh to face Stubbs. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Stubbs struck out, he said he was struck by what he considered the 
symbolism of the move. "I know what it looked like, and I'm sure you know what 
he was trying to do," Stubbs said reporters. "But I am not getting into a word 
war." 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs' next challenge will come in the free-agent market, where he is headed 
this winter. He said, no, he would not even consider returning to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, they already received a pitcher for him, Terry Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Wells finished the year at Albuquerque going 8-6 with a 4.62 ERA. Earlier this 
summer in five big league starts, he was 1-2 with a 7.84 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gott made one of baseball's best business decisions last winter when he 
accepted a contract with the Dodgers even though it contained the same $300,000 
base salary offered by Pittsburgh. However, the Pirates' incentives rewarded 
Gott only for saves and appearances, and the Dodgers' incentives rewarded him 
for remaining on the active roster. Confident that he would be sound, Gott 
picked the Dodgers and will make $900,000. If he had remained with the Pirates, 
he would have made about $575,000, entering Wednesday's game. "This year could 
not have worked out any better for me," Gott said. Because the Dodgers picked 
up an option on Jay Howell's contract that will pay him $1.05 million next 
year, Gott could eventually make more than Howell. . . . Ray Searage pitched 
for the first time since Aug. 14. He came off the disabled list Sept. 10.

THE ASSIST GOES TO MAGIC IN ACQUISITION OF TEAGLE 
</P>

<P>
Last act of the Terry Teagle trade: 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers disclosed Wednesday that the deal for the Golden State guard was 
made possible by Magic Johnson, who volunteered to give up part of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the salary of Mark McNamara, who was traded to the San Antonio 
Spurs, Johnson's rebate gave the Lakers the necessary room under the NBA's 
salary cap to pay Teagle. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson reportedly earns $2.5 million a year. He is thought to have given about 
$75,000 of it back. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson thus joins the NBA counter-revolution in salary. Chicago's Michael 
Jordan deferred part of his salary earlier this summer, so the Bulls could get 
Dennis Hopson. Philadelphia's Charles Barkley has said he'd do it to make room 
on the 76ers for Adrian Dantley. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it happened," Laker General Manager Jerry West said, "one day we were 
talking about players. I said we were trying to add a guard, but sometimes it's 
awkward because you don't have enough money under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Don't worry. I can help you.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I can't promise that we can give you this money back.' People think 
he's being taken care of down the line, but that's not the case. It'll be two 
years before Earvin Johnson can have anything done on his contract." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is in Spain, working on an endorsement deal and could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are reportedly at the salary cap, which prohibits them from 
renegotiating or extending contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Although Johnson has every expectation of getting his money back -- and more -- 
from owner Jerry Buss, and makes more money from outside interests than from 
the Lakers, he can say without fear of contradiction, he gave at the office.

NEWSWIRE: CHARGERS' PHILLIPS ATTACKED OUTSIDE BAR

Joe Phillips, San Diego Charger nose tackle, was hospitalized after being 
severely beaten by three men early Wednesday when he left a Mission Beach bar. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips suffered a fractured nose, fractures to the eye orbit, a concussion 
and multiple bruises and abrasions, a team spokesman announced after team 
physician Lee Rice's examination. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Phillips will undergo surgery to repair damage to his nose and eye 
orbit within the week. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, police had reported that Phillips had skull fractures, 
three broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken bone around his eye, but Rice's 
examination found no skull fracture or broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Phillips, 27, was being treated in the intensive care unit of Sharp 
Memorial Hospital, but a hospital spokeswoman would not describe his condition 
or even confirm that Phillips was there. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the attack occurred at 1 a.m. while Phillips was walking to his car 
after leaving Saska's, a bar and restaurant on Mission Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The three men, one wearing steel-toed boots, beat and kicked Phillips 
repeatedly before fleeing, Robinson said. Phillips, 6 feet 5 and 275 pounds, is 
one of the strongest Charger players. No arrests have been made, but police 
have interviewed three witnesses to the incident, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told a Times reporter that Phillips was accompanied by a woman who 
also was attacked. Robinson would not confirm this, and her identity and 
condition were not available. 
</P>
<P>
A motive has not been determined, but Phillips was not robbed, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers placed Phillips on the reserve non-football injury list, meaning 
he will be out for four games.

Angel right-hander Bert Blyleven will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right 
shoulder Monday in an effort to repair a problem that has reduced strength in 
the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
A club spokesman said Blyleven might have a slight tear in the rotator cuff, 
and the arthroscopic procedure was scheduled because Blyleven hasn't responded 
as well as expected to treatment and therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Team physician Lewis Yocum will perform the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, 39, hasn't pitched since Aug. 10. He is 8-7 with a 5.24 earned-run 
average this season and has 279 victories. He was signed to a guaranteed 
contract for 1991 at slightly more than $2 million. HELENE ELLIOTT

ROGERS' START IS ONLY THE BEGINNING FOR RANGERS;

Starter Kenny Rogers is a relief to the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers (10-5) made his second major league start Wednesday night and beat the 
Angels, 6-2, to stop a the Rangers' four-game losing streak. He held the Angels 
to three hits and an unearned run in six innings -- his longest outing ever. 
</P>
<P>
He'd better get used to it. Texas Manager Bobby Valentine said Rogers will get 
another start Tuesday at Toronto and probably move into the rotation in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our intention to get him ready to be a starter in the off-season," 
Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to get the chance because that's what they need -- a fifth 
starter," Rogers said. "I hope I can do it for a full year. I think I can make 
us a better team." 
</P>
<P>
It was Rogers' fifth victory this month but only the fifth this year by a 
Rangers' left-handed starter. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight was the best I've pitched all year," Rogers said. "I'm usually more of 
a thrower, but I was ahead in the count with my fastball and breaking ball, and 
throwing my breaking ball for strikes helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had won five in a row against the Rangers, but Texas scored three 
runs before Kirk McCaskill (12-11) got an out. The Angel starter gave up six 
runs on six hits in 3 2/3innings. 
</P>
<P>
"His velocity was not bad; his location was not good," Angel Manager Doug Rader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Pettis and Julio Franco singled to start the first inning, and both scored 
when Rafael Palmeiro tripled high off the center-field wall. Palmeiro scored on 
Ruben Sierra's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Palmeiro was two for three and raised his average to .323, seven points behind 
Kansas City's George Brett, in the AL batting race. 
</P>
<P>
Texas finished McCaskill with three runs in the fourth. Pete Incaviglia led off 
with a walk,went to third on Geno Petralli's single, then scored on a squeeze 
bunt by Steve Buechele. Gary Green singled in Petralli, stole second and scored 
on Pettis' single. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis reaggravated a lower back injury and was replaced by Luis Polonia 
in the fifth inning. . . . Ranger rookie shortstop Gary Green stole the first 
base of his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Rogers' 10th victory of the season marks only the second time in club 
history that five Ranger pitchers have won 10 or more games. The last time five 
Rangers won 10 or more games was in 1977. . . . The only other club in the 
majors with five pitchers winning 10 or more games this season is the Chicago 
White Sox.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ROBINSON, BREWERS STOP BLUE JAYS; RED SOX MOVE TO WITHIN A HALF-GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost unnoticed, Ron Robinson has become one of the most effective pitchers in 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
After struggling with shoulder problems for several seasons with the Cincinnati 
Reds, the 28-year-old right-hander has become the ace of the Milwaukee Brewer 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson gave the Toronto Blue Jays pennant hopes a jolt Wednesday night at 
Milwaukee when he pitched a seven-hitter in the Brewers' 6-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
With the Boston Red Sox snapping out of their hitting slump, the Blue Jays' 
lead in the American League East was cut to a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson (12-4) won for the eighth time in his last nine decisions. He had won 
seven in a row until last Friday, when he lost to Baltimore on three unearned 
runs despite pitching a four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, he had to work out of several jams to preserve the lead Paul Molitor 
gave him with his 12th home run. It was the 27th time he led off a game with a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays had runners on second and third with one out in the third inning 
and loaded the bases with two out in the fifth. Second baseman Jim Gantner 
saved Robinson in the fifth when he went behind the bag for Rance Mulliniks' 
grounder and barely got the force out at second. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays were without third baseman Kelly Gruber, who has the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 7, Cleveland 2 -- The Red Sox scored more runs in the first inning of 
this game at Boston than they scored in any of the previous six games. 
</P>
<P>
Fortified with five runs, rookie Dana Kiecker (8-9) overcame wildness to go six 
innings and give the Red Sox their fourth victory in the last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the skid, the Red Sox are in a postion in which they can move into a 
tie for first place by winning at Detroit tonight. That would set the stage for 
a three-game weekend series at Boston with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Kiecker gave up only two hits in six innings, but he put a strain on Manager 
Joe Morgan's nerves when he walked seven batters. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Rivera's two-run single climaxed a first inning in which there were five 
hits, two errors, a balk and a wild pitch by Tom Candiotti (14-11). 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, Mike Greenwell hit his 14th home run. It was the Red Sox's 
100th home run of the season, a figure they have reached 44 times in 45 years. 
They failed only in strike-shortened 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Kiecker, a 29-year-old right-hander, was 59-66 in seven years in the minors. He 
figures he can win one more for the Red Sox to reach .500. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, it's going to be fun," Kiecker said. "That's what it's all about. 
Now is a good time to peak. I definitely didn't put on a clinic with all those 
walks." 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh inning, after his seventh walk, Kiecker was replaced by Larry 
Andersen, who surrendered his first run in his 12th relief appearance for the 
Red Sox. Jeff Gray took over in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 3, Kansas City 2 -- Bob Welch became the first pitcher in 18 years to 
win 26 games and set a club record for victories in this game at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
It is the most victories in a season since Steve Carlton won 27 games for the 
Philadelphia Phillies in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Until this victory, Welch (26-6) was tied with Catfish Hunter for the Oakland 
victory mark. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee scored twice for the Athletics and Mark McGwire scored one run and 
drove in another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something special," Welch said after giving up nine hits in 7 2/3 
innings. "It didn't feel right going down to warm up with Dave Duncan. He's 
been with me all year." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan, the Athletics' pitching coach, left the team because his wife was 
injured in an auto accident in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Welch needed help in the eighth inning from Rick Honeycutt, and Dennis 
Eckersley pitched the ninth, striking out two for his 45th save. 
</P>
<P>
George Brett went one for three and remained at .330 in the batting race. The 
A's Rickey Henderson, who is batting .324, did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 8, Detroit 4 -- Erik Hanson struck out 10 in 7 1/3 innings at Detroit 
to reach 204 strikeouts, the first Mariner right-hander to get 200. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson (17-9) made Cecil Fielder one of his victims. Fielder was hitless and 
needs two home runs in his last seven games to reach 50. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4, Baltimore 2 -- Dave Righetti pitched a perfect ninth inning at New 
York for his 223rd save, most for a left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti saved it for Chuck Cary (6-11), who tore the nail on the middle finger 
of his left hand and had to leave in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees have won 65 games this season and Righetti has saved 35 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Balboni hit his 17th home run and Jesse Barfield had three hits to lead 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Minnesota 1 -- The White Sox were eliminated in the West Tuesday 
night, but they are still tied with Pittsburgh (90-65) for the second-best 
record in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hibbard (14-9) gave up three hits in eight innings and Bobby Thigpen 
worked out of a jam in the ninth to extend his record for saves to 54. DAN

RIJO, DAVIS LEAD REDS TO VICTORY OVER BRAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before he went out to pitch his third consecutive complete-game victory, 
right-hander Jose Rijo was talking as if the race in the National League West 
were over. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what Yogi said about it not being over, it's over," Rijo had said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Reds' starter went out and pitched the Reds to a 5-2 victory over the 
Atlanta Braves Wednesday night at Cincinnati. He finished with 11 strikeouts 
and had a shutout until Ron Gant hit a two-run home run in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers' losing, the Reds' magic number is three. Cincinnati plays 
seven more games, all at home. Three of them are against Houston, the worst 
road team in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis, who was two for four against Atlanta starter John Smoltz (13-11), 
led the Reds with three runs batted in. Cincinnati scored twice in the first 
inning when Davis singled in a run. He then added a two-run home run in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo (14-7), a hard-throwing right-hander who is often on the disabled list 
late in the season because of a chronic shoulder problem, has been the Reds' 
best pitcher in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
He is 6-1 with five complete games in his last seven starts. Fortunately for 
the Reds, he took over when Danny Jackson and Tom Browning had trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo was shaky in this one, giving up six hits in the first four innings. Then 
he settled down and retired 11 in a row before running into trouble in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo said maybe he had not been quite as confident as he sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw L.A. win last night and I said, 'Oh, there we go again,' " he said. 
"That put a little more pressure on me. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I'd better do something tonight because I didn't want Yogi (Berra) to 
be right, I want to be the one who is right." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella said, "Jose is pitching as well as any pitcher in 
baseball." DAN HAFNER

Good news for USC fans: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The last time USC was shut out before last week, a 24-0 loss to Arizona 
State in 1985, the Trojans came back the next week to rout Oregon State, 63-0. 
The 87-point turnaround was the biggest in Trojan history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Smith is 3-0 against Ohio State Coach John Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Before Smith and USC beat Cooper and Ohio State last season, 42-3, Smith and 
Arizona twice beat Cooper and Arizona State. The Wildcats knocked Arizona State 
out of a Rose Bowl bid with a 16-13 victory in 1985 and won again the next 
year, 34-17, handing the Sun Devils their only loss of a 10-1-1 season that 
included a 22-15 victory over Michigan in the Rose Bowl. JERRY CROWE

<P>
FOOTBALL: FRESNO STATE'S CRAVER DIDN'T PLAY FOOTBALL AT COMPTON HIGH. NOW HE IS 
RATED AMONG THE BEST RUNNING BACKS IN COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fresno State tailback Aaron Craver had no idea what to do when he graduated 
from Compton High in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Craver still had no plans, but he had a better idea of where 
he was going: Nowhere. And fast. 
</P>
<P>
Craver served as a volunteer youth coach at a local park but didn't have a 
paying job and didn't go to college. When he wasn't coaching, he was usually in 
Compton pool halls, hustling $5 games of billiards. "I made enough to get 
through the day every day," Craver said. 
</P>
<P>
But by the spring of 1987, Craver realized he wasn't the next Minnesota Fats 
and knew he had better get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of fellow coaches, Craver, who ran on the track team but didn't 
play football in high school, enrolled at El Camino College and tried out for 
the football team. Little did he suspect that the decision might put him on the 
fast track to the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 215-pound Craver rushed for 1,355 yards and 14 touchdowns in two 
seasons at El Camino and earned a scholarship to Fresno State, where he rushed 
for a school-record 1,313 yards in 1989 and was an All-Big West Conference 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting News rated Craver as the No. 1 college running back in the nation 
going into the 1990 season, and Craver is off to a solid start, having rushed 
for 443 yards and seven touchdowns to help the Bulldogs get off to a 4-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy, whose Titans play at Fresno State 
Saturday night, projects Craver as "a high-round NFL draft pick" next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought this would happen," Craver said. "Every time I go to bed at 
night I say, 'Dang, I can't believe this is happening.' It's weird, but it 
shows you what a lot of hard work can do." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it helped that Craver also had an abundance of ability. 
</P>
<P>
Tryouts at El Camino lasted five days, but after Craver ran the 40-yard dash 
and caught a few passes on the first day, Coach John Featherstone told him he 
had made the team. 
</P>
<P>
Craver is speedy by tailback standards but has displayed the power of a 
fullback, often punishing those who tackle him. Although he's quick enough to 
run outside, he prefers to burst through holes in the line. 
</P>
<P>
He also can catch the ball, as evidenced by his 25 receptions for 168 yards and 
a touchdown in 1989 and his nine catches for 78 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell pro scouts that, although they might not see it in our offense, he has 
the best hands of anyone I've had here since Henry Ellard," Fresno State Coach 
Jim Sweeney said. "He has amazing manual dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
"He catches footballs in practice behind his back, between his legs; he can go 
long and catch. In fact, after I hang up (the phone), I'm going to go talk to 
my offensive coordinator to find out why we don't throw to him more." 
</P>
<P>
The Fresno State coaches also see room for improvement, areas where Craver's 
inexperience shows up. For instance, a play might be designed for the tailback 
to run to a specific gap, but Craver will go for another opening. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to ad-lib sometimes instead of being disciplined to stay with the 
play," Sweeney said. "But he also has great instincts and tremendous quickness 
for his size. Sometimes I think we over-coach him and limit his natural 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
Craver's athletic potential was a resource that went virtually untapped at 
Compton High. 
</P>
<P>
He was an accomplished Pop Warner League football player, but when he tried out 
for the team in his first year at Compton, Craver said the coaches wanted him 
to play receiver. He wanted to play running back or option quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"They said I wasn't fast enough, that I was too small, stuff like that," Craver 
said. "But what happened was they had another running back coming in who was in 
my grade; they didn't want to run the option, and they needed receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that the coaches disliked me. They just didn't give me an 
opportunity to play the position I wanted to play. I had another sport I could 
do, so I said forget it and just ran track." 
</P>
<P>
Craver was a league champion in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles as a senior 
but did not receive any track scholarship offers. 
</P>
<P>
Because he skipped the sixth grade as part of a community project to advance 
brighter students through the system, Craver was only 16 when he graduated. But 
he was a C student through high school, and college was not his top priority. 
</P>
<P>
So after high school, he lived at home, which meant he didn't need a full-time 
job to survive. And he didn't have much desire to continue school. 
</P>
<P>
Then some of his friends from junior high school started getting athletic 
scholarships, and that depressed Craver. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down in the dumps then because I wished I had played high school 
football," Craver said. "Coaching took my mind off my problems. I had thought 
about going to school, but I didn't think I'd be that good of a player. Then I 
got the guts to try it." 
</P>
<P>
Craver went to El Camino hoping to have a little fun, capture some of the glory 
he missed out on in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Then all this happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely surprised at how things turned out," Craver said. "I never 
thought I'd get a scholarship or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Craver has a scholarship and a lot more this season -- the expectations that 
accompany the label of "nation's best running back." Craver said it was an 
honor, but with it came a burden. 
</P>
<P>
"When they say you're the best, it makes you think you have to be better than 
you are," Craver said. "If I run for eight yards, I think, I'm supposed to be 
the best, I should have got 20 on that run. It bothers you sometimes. I may put 
too much pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said Craver shouldn't be so hard on himself because he's still learning 
the position. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he touches the football, it's a learning experience," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
It's an experience that changed his life.

SOUTHERN SECTION GIVES LELAND SPARKS OK TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leland Sparks, a fifth-year senior at Santa Ana Mater Dei High, has been 
cleared to play football by the Southern Section Executive Committee, 
Commissioner Stan Thomas said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, who transferred from Van Nuys Montclair Prep three weeks ago, had been 
granted a fifth year of eligibility by Southern Section officials two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, however, Sparks' transcripts from Montclair Prep showed that he 
had not completed the required 20 units during the spring semester and 
therefore was academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Southern Section officials reviewed another transcript provided by 
Montclair Prep, which showed that Sparks had met the requirement for 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a corrected transcript, and in a (class) where no grade appeared 
before, a passing grade has been inserted," Thomas said. "He now meets the 
required 20 units." 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, a wide receiver/defensive back who has been practicing with Mater Dei 
for a week, still had a grade-point average for the spring semester of less 
than the required 2.0. However, he can be placed on academic probation, which 
would allow him to play. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Porter, Mater Dei principal, said Sparks would not play tonight against 
Riverside Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Porter is reviewing Sparks' class performance, and a decision should be made in 
the next week on when he will be allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks, Leland's cousin, also transferred to Mater Dei three weeks ago 
and is playing football. He is on academic probation. CHRIS FOSTER

Wayne Gretzky scored twice and added two assists Wednesday night to lead the 
Kings to a 5-3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks in a National Hockey League 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings scored two third-period goals to break a 3-3 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Just over two minutes into the final period, Todd Elik scored off an assist 
from Francois Breault. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky added the clincher at 5:35 with his second goal of the game coming on a 
power play. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings improved to 5-3. Vancouver dropped to 1-4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Each team has two remaining exhibitions before opening the regular season Oct. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
The attendance was 9,936, nearly 5,000 short of capacity in the Seattle 
Coliseum. The NHL will expand by two teams for the 1992-93 season and Seattle 
is one of eight cities in the running for an expansion team.

Ameron: The Monterey Park-based manufacturer of construction materials said 
third-quarter earnings rose 9% to $4.6 million on revenue that was up 1% to 
$121 million. The company said increased business in the Southwest and 
continued strong demand for building products in Hawaii boosted results.

YOUR WHEELS: NO ONE RATES OIL FILTERS, BUT SOMEBODY SHOULD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: A Toyota dealer advised me that upon changing my engine oil after the 
first 3,000 miles, I should use only a Toyota oil filter. The Toyota filter 
costs about $7.50. Such name-brand filters as Frahm and Purolator are sold from 
time to time at cut-rate stores for only $2.50. Is there any reason for 
sticking with the manufacturer's filter? J.B. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: An oil filter can be as important as the oil, yet it is far more 
difficult to obtain information about the quality of the filter. 
</P>
<P>
You can't determine the quality of an oil filter by looking at one. No 
independent organization rates or tests oil filters, as is the case with oil. 
And the price of an oil filter does not indicate its ability to protect an 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
Auto manufacturers such as Toyota have a vested interest in recommending that 
consumers buy their more expensive filters. Virtually any part from a dealer 
will be more expensive than one from a discount retailer or auto parts store. 
</P>
<P>
Most auto experts suggest that motorists can depend on major name-brand oil 
filters. Buying store brands, such as filters from Sears or K mart, involves 
more unknowns. If a filter carries no brand name and is not sold by a major 
retailer, you may have nobody standing behind the product. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the major U.S. oil filter producers also sell to auto makers. Frahm, 
for example, makes filters for Honda as well as for retailers who apply their 
private label. 
</P>
<P>
The filters sold under the name brand and private label, even though they are 
made at the same factory, may not be of equal quality. For example, filters 
Frahm sells under its own name are designed to catch 90% of dirt particles 
between 10 and 20 microns on the first pass through the filter, according to 
Gordon Jones, an engineer for Allied-Signal, which makes Frahm filters. (A 
micron is one-millionth of a meter.) 
</P>
<P>
Dirt particles between 10 and 20 microns are considered the most harmful, 
because they are small enough to move through small passages in the lubricating 
system and large enough to cause abrasion in moving engine parts, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
But Frahm also makes filters under private labels that will capture only 80% of 
those dirt particles. Those filters contain less expensive filter elements, 
which are made of pleated paper that contains a secret mixture of glass, 
synthetic and cellulous fibers. Even so, Frahm believes its private-label 
filters are better than many competitors filters, which may capture as little 
as 60% of dirt particles on the first pass, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of dirt a filter can hold before it stops doing its job mostly 
depends on the size of the filter. 
</P>
<P>
Many auto manufacturers in recent years have reduced the size of filters to 
conserve engine space and increase the interval between recommended oil 
changes. It has been a bad policy. 
</P>
<P>
When an oil filter absorbs all the dirt it can hold, a safety valve opens to 
allow oil to circulate without any filtering. There is no way of knowing when 
that happens, though. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a very small oil filter, especially the tiny three-inch filters 
that have become common, it is another reason to change your oil and filter 
more frequently than recommended.

INTO THE NIGHT: 'PACIFIC HEIGHTS' PREMIERE SCARES UP A CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene: Monday night's premiere of 20th Century Fox's suspense thriller 
"Pacific Heights" at the Avco Cinema followed by a party at the chic Noa Noa 
restaurant in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Who was there: The film's stars, Michael Keaton, Matthew Modine, Laurie Metcalf 
and Tippi Hedren (her daughter -- and co-star -- Melanie Griffith was filming 
in Berlin) as well as director John Schlesinger, who came with Shirley 
MacLaine; among the 1,800 at the screening and 250 at the after-party were 
Johnny Depp with Winona Ryder, Marisa Berenson, "Batman" director Tim Burton, 
James Woods, seldom-seen producer Robert Evans, Penny Marshall, Howie Mandel, 
Ted and Susie Field, and Buck Henry with Carrie Fisher. Because Schlesinger is 
British, there were local Brit Pack notables, including David Hockney, Roddy 
McDowall and Music Center Opera general director Peter Hemmings. 
</P>
<P>
The locale: Noa Noa's design was described by an employee as "21st Century 
combined with '50s coffee shop." One guest appreciated the metal, faux African 
tribal shields above "the Howard Johnson thing they've got going with the 
orange booths." Another said, "the ladies room is a real treat -- kind of like 
the Tiki Room at Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
The buzz: After seeing Michael Keaton's psycho tenant character, landlords 
begin to look like sympathetic figures. "Next thing you know they'll be making 
agents look lovable," said one woman. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Comparing "Pacific Heights" to "Fatal Attraction," executive producer 
James Robinson said the film was jokingly called "Fatal Tenant" around the set. 
"I don't think this is going to do much for rent control," Keaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Dress mode: The usual Hollywood after-school casual that runs the spectrum from 
Italian wool to Harley leather. Be advised that hand-painted ties look to be 
this year's dreaded Christmas fun-gift. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: Of an unnamed industry player, one guest enthused, "His talent is 
really in the producer/sleazoid side of the business. He's really a formidable 
talent." Where but Hollywood could you hear praise like that? 
</P>
<P>
Chow: An exemplary buffet of Polynesian chicken salad, Thai curry with roasted 
scallops, rigatoni in tomato basil sauce, as well as shrimp, oysters and 
truffles passed on trays. Noa Noa calls its cuisine "California-French with an 
Oriental accent." A guest described it as "Brentwood cooking." 
</P>
<P>
Fact not fiction: Schlesinger, who had just returned from directing opera in 
Salzburg, Austria, began his show-biz career doing a magic act for World War II 
troops in Southeast Asia.

LEGAL VIEW: HOW TO GET A FILL-IN-THE-BLANK WILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN and LOUIS M. BROWN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do they really work? How do I get my hands on one? 
</P>
<P>
Those were some of the many questions readers asked after last week's column on 
the California Statutory Will, the fill-in-the-blanks form that you can use 
without hiring a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The second question is easily answered. Stores that sell stationery, office 
supplies and legal forms (such as leases or promissory notes) usually stock two 
versions of the statutory will. If you can't find one in a local store, 
Wolcott's, in downtown Los Angeles, has them. 
</P>
<P>
Or, even easier, you can buy one through the mail from the State Bar of 
California. Send $1, plus a self-addressed, business-size envelope with 39 
cents of postage, to: State Bar of California, Wills, P.O. Box 411, San 
Francisco, 94101 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the first question -- do they work? -- is more complicated. They 
work; that is, they are accepted by the probate court, if they are filled in 
properly. But even with all the i's dotted and the t's crossed, the form may 
not be the best option for those who, under the advice of a lawyer, need more 
choices than the form offers. 
</P>
<P>
It is also difficult to determine if the forms actually work as intended. There 
are no statistics on how many are rejected in probate court, or how many have 
actually been completed. 
</P>
<P>
But there seems to be a great deal of consumer interest in the forms. In 1983, 
the first year they were available, the State Bar sold 175,000 copies. And 
after an earlier Legal View column that explained how to order the form, the 
State Bar received 2,000 requests in one week. (California was the first state 
to create a statutory will; they were introduced in 1925 in England, where they 
have not been especially popular.) 
</P>
<P>
Some lawyers and probate experts raise concerns that the forms are too 
difficult to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara J. Miller, an Alameda County Court commissioner, last year told 
California Lawyer magazine that most statutory wills in her jurisdiction were 
not completed correctly. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Gerry W. Beyer, a law professor at St. Mary's University of 
San Antonio, Tex., and author of a comprehensive law review article on the 
subject, could not find any appellate decisions in California involving the 
statutory will. That could indicate that rejected wills are not a serious 
problem and that family members are not taking their fight beyond trial court 
in the event of a rejection. Or it could simply mean that the forms have not 
been around long enough to wind through the court system. 
</P>
<P>
A group of lawyers have been working with the State Bar to amend the statutory 
will. The additions would give consumers more choices and improve the 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The current form, for example, provides for the selection of a guardian for 
"the person" and "the property" of minor children. Some people might not 
understand the difference. One version of the proposed revision includes this 
explanation: 
</P>
<P>
"If you have children under age 18, you should designate a guardian of their 
persons to raise them. You may also want to designate a guardian of their 
estate to manage their assets for them until they reach age 18. At age 18, they 
receive their assets outright. Some people may prefer to designate a custodian 
to manage assets until as late as age 25." 
</P>
<P>
Other proposed amendments include provisions for more than the one cash gift, 
the exclusion of family members, and the unequal division of the estate among 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Another option would establish an administrative procedure to certify the 
validity of the will upon completion. Imagine a "statutory will deputy" 
authorized to review the form during the will maker's lifetime and correct any 
technical mistakes.

GOSPEL OF 'IDOMENEO' ACCORDING TO SENDAK AND CORSARO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Here we go again. 
</P>
<P>
The wonders of a great opera are compromised by gimmickry. A meddlesome 
director and designer refuse to trust the composer. The procedure has become 
all too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, re-creational modernists manage to violate the letter of the 
original law, yet still illuminate the spirit. That's terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Other second-guessers are so intent on imposing their own irrelevant vision on 
the piece at hand that they distort or even destroy the intended dramatic 
impulses. They move against the music. That's irksome. 
</P>
<P>
It becomes especially irksome when the music is sensitively conducted, 
exquisitely sung and elegantly played. Sublime sound can go only so far to 
outweigh ridiculous sight. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for sad example, Mozart's "Idomeneo" as staged by Frank Corsaro, 
illustrated by Maurice Sendak and conducted by Roderick Brydon for the Music 
Center Opera on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If our records are accurate, Los Angeles had never before seen a major staging 
of the lofty opera seria (USC mustered a modest workshop version in 1966). Los 
Angeles still hasn't seen a faithful representation of this stylized 
exploration of jealousy, devotion, heroism and renunciation on the island of 
Crete in the wake of the Trojan War. 
</P>
<P>
"Idomeneo," written in 1781 when Mozart had reached the ripe old age of 25, 
isn't easy. It is long, slow and irrevocably bound to certain period 
conventions. The plot, for all its convolutions, is static. The characters are 
stereotypes. The musical structure relies on set formulas. Luckily, Mozart's 
inspiration transcended any potential liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
One wouldn't have guessed that at the Music Center. Corsaro decided that the 
idiom needed to be juiced up. Forget classic nobility. Let's have a 
psychosexual charade. 
</P>
<P>
Idomeneo, the king of Crete, was really Leopold Mozart, the composer's 
overbearing father. That was Corsaro's irrelevant concept. Idamante, the 
troubled prince, was really Mozart himself. The opera, we were told, really 
concerns the complex love-hate relationship between the paternal despot and the 
youthful pretender to his aesthetic throne. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Dr. Freud. And where are you, Peter Shaffer, when we don't need you? 
</P>
<P>
Everyone loves Maurice Sendak. Everyone loves his cuddly shaggy dogs, his plump 
cherubs, his naughty boys, his charming monsters. He is a master of dark-edged 
humor, and his magical images cast their spell far beyond children's books. 
With "Idomeneo," however, he seems to have strayed into the wrong scenic 
milieu. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing Corsaro's dubious historical concept, he plays the beginning and 
the end in young Mozart's study. There's the young genius in a caricature of a 
famous portrait on the wall. There's the boy himself, in the same powdered wig 
and breeches, seated at the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
Quiet. He's composing something. Listen. We think it's "Idomeneo." Gosh. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Papa Leopold, in similar Baroque attire. He scorns the kid's creative 
effort. Perhaps he's jealous. No matter. We're off, for a while, to ancient 
Crete. Sendak's Crete is a jumbled jungle of ungainly flats and drops, most of 
which struggle in vain to avoid looking comical at worst, whimsical at best. 
</P>
<P>
Sendak's costumes -- very unflattering to the women in the cast -- assign vague 
fairy-tale antiquity to the non-"historical" participants. But King Idomeneo 
remains the courtly Leopold Mozart throughout, and Idamante never forswears the 
Baroque trappings of Amadeus. The result trivializes the mythology. It also 
looks silly. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsaro/Sendak madness does reflect a method, however obscure and dubious 
that method may be. Too bad the management of the Music Center Opera didn't 
deem an explanatory essay worthwhile. The audience deserves a little 
enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, this "Idomeneo" is best appreciated with eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
Brydon, who has replaced the originally scheduled Christof Perick, conducts 
with tender, lyrical, reasonably stylish care. He accompanies his singers with 
obvious compassion but never slights emotional impetus. In the process, he 
elicits elegant support from the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, obviously in 
its element here. 
</P>
<P>
He also has made some wise editorial decisions, relying on a nearly complete 
version of the Munich edition of 1781. The only major cuts -- both pardonable 
-- remove Arbace's second aria and the rather mechanical final ballet of 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart wrote the role of Idamante for castrato, a vocal phenomenon now 
gratefully extinct. Some companies opt for a tenor, but the Los Angeles forces 
chose a mezzo-soprano of the Cherubino mold and thus sustained appropriate 
timbral contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
The cast functioned as an ensemble of virtuosos. Siegfried Jerusalem, the most 
celebrated Wagnerian tenor of the day, brought manly dignity, ample agility, 
dynamic finesse and burnished tone -- some passing pitch problems 
notwithstanding -- to the title role. Susan Quittmeyer complemented him -- and 
Corsaro's directorial conceit too -- as an Idamante of tremendous suavity and 
sensitivity. She has become a trouser-role specialist with few peers. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Coburn looked a bit robust for the sweet-ingenue platitudes of Ilia, but 
she sang with limpid, angelic tone that proved especially compelling in her 
great aria, "Zeffiretti, lusinghieri." 
</P>
<P>
Although her soprano isn't as dark or as heavy as cliche might have it in this 
evil role, Christine Weidinger swept all before her with an Elettra of 
galvanizing passion and stunning vocal bravura. She even managed those 
hysterical descending cackles of the mad scene, "D'Oreste e d'Aiace," with easy 
and accurate aplomb. That claim cannot be made for many a more celebrated 
interpreter of the role. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary roles were in good hands. Jonathan Mack coped crisply, even 
sweetly, with the demanding but unrewarding duties of Arbace. When he wasn't 
straining for high notes, John Atkins sang incisively as the High Priest. Louis 
Lebherz boomed imposingly as the Voice of Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
The performance began at 7:30 and ended after 11. The hours crept on apace.

NYC BALLET OPENS WITH BALANCHINE;

<P>
Who owns the ballets of George Balanchine? Is the obvious answer the most 
truthful? 
</P>
<P>
The issue of ownership, of primacy, loomed large Tuesday, when New York City 
Ballet brought to the Orange County Performing Arts Center four Balanchine 
masterworks familiar to local audiences from performances by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Linked by his bold and often profound musicality, here was the unsurpassed 
purity of form Balanchine defined in "Concerto Barocco" (1941), the charming 
vivacity of impulse in the Gottschalk "Tarantella" (1964), the startling 
modernistic innovation of "The Four Temperaments" (1946) and the imposing 
affirmation of academic tradition in "Theme and Variations" (1947). 
</P>
<P>
As the House of Balanchine -- the touchstone of his style -- City Ballet should 
have looked equally authoritative in each of these classics. In fact, only "The 
Four Temperaments" escaped the imbalances in casting and deficiencies of 
production that plagued the program. 
</P>
<P>
Capped by Peter Boal's brilliant performance of the Melancholic variation 
(intensely private yet filling the stage with his sense of need), the "4 Ts" 
also boasted the superbly sharp, forceful legwork of Diana White in the 
Choleric section, the nearly visionary gestural eloquence of Adam Luders in the 
Phlegmatic sequence and the drop-dead exactitude of Melinda Roy and Jock Soto 
in the Sanguinic duet. In addition, the Hindemith score inspired the best 
playing of the night from the company orchestra conducted by Hugo Fiorato. 
</P>
<P>
However "Concerto Barocco" found the orchestra sounding slovenly in the Bach 
double violin concerto and Heather Watts looking both mannered and heavy 
(clenched balances, labored phrasing) opposite a conscientious Otto Neubert and 
a dutiful Judith Fugate. 
</P>
<P>
Fugate appeared no more distinctive in "Theme and Variations," making her debut 
as the prima in place of the indisposed Merrill Ashley. No gaffes, no lapses of 
taste, but no majesty or presence either. And though Lindsay Fischer brought a 
measure of suavity to the demanding solos of her cavalier, the sublime pas de 
deux went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
After performances by San Francisco Ballet, the Kirov and American Ballet 
Theatre, "Theme and Variations" had virtually become the official ballet of the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center -- but the City Ballet version scarcely 
measured up in either overall dancing finesse or production values. Nicolas 
Benois' costumes proved particularly unfortunate . . . 
</P>
<P>
Immediately preceding "Theme": three short, relatively unfamiliar neo-Romantic 
ballets that Balanchine choreographed in 1970 and wrapped together with the 
earlier work as "Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3." Each of these prequels featured a 
lone male and a minicorps of women in long, filmy, scooped-neck gowns, their 
hair worn loose, their movement style restless and fluid. 
</P>
<P>
In "Elegie," a brooding Kipling Houston pursued and lost the very glamorous 
Maria Calegari. In "Valse Melancolique," an effortful Nilas Martins danced with 
the deft Lauren Hauser as if both were under a spell or lost in a dream. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in "Scherzo," Nichol Hlinka and Gen Horiuchi flew through a virtuosic 
coda to this three-part distillation of 19th-Century vision scenes: those 
poetic fantasies of yearning that contrast with the aristocratic formality of 
the ballroom (or wedding) acts represented by "Theme." 
</P>
<P>
Completing the program: that zesty "Tarantella," with the highly accomplished 
but overbearing Damian Woetzel mismatched with the technically uneven but 
magnificently kittenish Margaret Tracey. 
</P>
<P>
This company may not always be equal to its ambitions, but dancers like Boal, 
White, Luders, Calegari and Tracey do make the choreography their own and share 
their discoveries with a generosity that remains a City Ballet hallmark. They 
own Balanchine's ballets and, when they dance, so do we. 
</P>
<P>
Performances will continue through Sunday afternoon.

CHANTICLEER SINGS AT NEW SHANNON CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new auditorium, a new season and a second visit by Chanticleer, that splendid 
male chorus from San Francisco, added up to a gala Tuesday evening in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-man vocal ensemble -- it usually tours with 12 members, as at its 
Christmas appearance in Long Beach last year -- seemed the perfect opening 
attraction in the new, $10-million, 403-seat Ruth B. Shannon Center for the 
Performing Arts at Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
The main theater (the center also includes a 72-seat studio theater) is a 
handsome, jewel-box of an auditorium with a small downstairs section overlooked 
by two tiers of surrounding balconies: a miniature opera house. 
</P>
<P>
As heard from downstairs, Chanticleer displayed its musical strengths to 
advantage in the acoustically grateful auditorium, where its easy resonance and 
usually immaculate intonation rang out effortlessly. In addition, the group's 
vaunted command of many styles was proven once again, the singers' technical 
and performing resources joyfully exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
This is an ensemble with a clear mission: to bring together the musical riches 
of centuries in eclectic but never mishmash programs. Stating the purpose is 
easier than accomplishing it, yet the program for this first performance of the 
group's 1990-91 season -- with three new members making debuts -- made sense 
both in the ear and on the page. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Jennings, Chanticleer's music director (who did not make an appearance) 
put together an agenda neatly paced and comfortingly varied. He adhered to the 
serious-half/light-half format performed by many, but without crassness. After 
a long intermission, there was no letdown. 
</P>
<P>
What one listener savored most strongly were 20th-Century compositions by 
Francis Poulenc, Allen Shearer and Franz Biebl; a whole program of important 
music of our own time would no doubt reveal best the accomplishments of this 
gifted ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, the most beauteous and intriguing sounds heard on this bare -- and 
prosceniumless -- stage Tuesday came in Poulenc's "Quatre petites prieres de 
St. Francois d'Assise," two pieces by Shearer and Biebl's "Ave Maria." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the smile-invoking second half -- including stylishly performed tunes by, 
among others, Stephen Foster, Vincent Youmans (uncredited in this program for 
"Without a Song") and Cole Porter -- did not disappoint, either in performing 
fervor or handsome singing.

L.A.'S RAPPERS SHOW SOLIDARITY FOR MAYFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because old R&amp;B records are the bricks and mortar of hip-hop, rap artists 
are both more knowledgeable and more cynical about the roots of their music 
than many of their rock 'n' roll peers -- a James Brown or a Rick James stomp 
is more useful dead than alive, deconstructed into its various parts and 
rebuilt into something new. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a little surprising that the hip-hop community embraced Curtis 
Mayfield as wholeheartedly as it did. Ice-T scored big with a brilliant rap 
version of his "Pusherman" last year; hints of "Superfly" seemed to pop up in 
half of last year's rap albums. Mayfield's score to "Superfly '90" is more or 
less an all-star rap compilation. 
</P>
<P>
At the Palace on Tuesday, there was another all-star rap compilation of sorts, 
a benefit concert to raise money for Mayfield, who lies paralyzed in an Atlanta 
hospital after a freak accident, and the hip-hop community showed its greatest 
solidarity in years. (Things were pushed along a little by Capitol Records, 
which has the "Superfly '90" album to promote.) 
</P>
<P>
The Soul Sisters and Craze started things off, novelty rappers whose acts 
started to drag about 30 seconds into their brief sets. The Uzi ros, a 
UTFO-style rap band from the Bay Area, played a too-lengthy set of rock and 
hip-hop and funk. C.P.O., a new Compton rap group associated with N.W.A.'s MC 
Ren, did a solid five minutes, as did original L.A. gangster rapper King Tee. 
</P>
<P>
There was a Latino-rap summit, with Cuban L.A. rapper Mellow Man Ace and 
Chicano L.A. rapper Kid Frost reprising their various hits and coming together 
for some Spanish-language freestyle -- the highlight of the show. The D.O.C., 
Eazy-E and Tone Loc -- all featured prominently in the promotion of the show -- 
poked their heads on stage, smiled shyly and left without rapping a line. 
Mayfield's original Impressions, also scheduled to show, never did. 
</P>
<P>
Save a short dedication by Frost, the first artist to talk about Mayfield was 
Ice-T, who spoke a short appreciation, and asked the audience to give Mayfield 
a moment of noise . . . silence was too gloomy. Ice-T's set -- he seems to have 
as many guys on stage as MC Hammer, except Ice-T's drink beer instead of dance 
-- was sloppy but heartfelt, more an on-stage party than a show. 
</P>
<P>
Fishbone, expanded to a 10-piece rock band, played an energetic set, and at 2 
a.m. an all-star band of sidemen from Santana, Bruce Hornsby and the E Street 
Band played subtle, slick versions of Mayfield stuff like "Gypsy Woman" to an 
audience of clean-up crews and bartenders. JONATHAN GOLD

THIELEMANS BEGUILES CATALINA CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean (Toots) Thielemans, the veteran virtuoso from Belgium who opened Tuesday 
at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood, is a man of several talents, as 
guitarist, whistler, composer and harmonica player. 
</P>
<P>
They have given him an entree into many areas, from commercials (Old Spice) to 
records with Quincy Jones, and even pop dates with Paul Simon; but a small jazz 
group remains his preferred setting. 
</P>
<P>
As the man who brought to the chromatic harmonica the same acceptance in jazz 
that Larry Adler had earned for it in classical music, Thielemans improvises on 
it with such clarity of vision, such dexterity and tonal beauty, that one 
reacts to the message without ever being concerned about the modesty of the 
medium. 
</P>
<P>
Playing pop and jazz standards -- "I Can't Get Started," "Days of Wine and 
Roses," Thad Jones' "Three and One" -- he interspersed his set with sentimental 
comments about his days with Benny Goodman, George Shearing and, most notably, 
Jaco Pastorius, to whose "Three Views of a Secret" he brought a warmly personal 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
He expressed justifiable pride in his sidemen. They are the sensitive, 
harmonically imaginative pianists Michel Herr -- a fellow Brussels native, who 
played his own award-winning composition "Labyrinthe" -- and the Italian 
bassist Riccardo Del Fra, whom he turned loose on a deeply moving treatment of 
"I'm A Fool to Want You." 
</P>
<P>
For a finale, as always, Thielemans switched to guitar and offered his 
whistling-and-guitar-unison version of his most famous composition, 
"Bluesette." When the audience insisted on more, he introduced a new and 
delightful original, "Song for My Lady," then picked up the harmonica to close 
with "Ne Me Quitte Pas." 
</P>
<P>
In the world of jazz, Thielemans remains one of a kind, an artist of unique 
musical and personal charm. An hour under his spell is a rare and rewarding 
experience. He closes Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER

BODYBUILDERS STAGE SHOW OF STRENGTH FOR GYM; 
</P>
<P>
PROTEST: MOST ARE UPSET BECAUSE THEY PAID DUES TO USE A GYM THAT WAS CLOSED 
SEPT. 6. THEY WANT IT REOPENED.

<P>
The musclemen from Uptown want their gym back -- now. Hoisting signs instead of 
barbells, a group of more than 30 bodybuilders and weightlifters converged on 
Central Park on Sunday to denounce closure of the Uptown Gym, a popular workout 
place for serious bodybuilders. 
</P>
<P>
Gym members are upset because they have paid dues to use a gym that has been 
closed since Sept. 6. The facility has been locked tight since a 
court-appointed management company fired Jon Bailey, the gym's only employee. 
</P>
<P>
The gym's owners have no say in the matter because the business was seized last 
year in a drug raid. Co-owner Rick Weaver, who awaits trial on drug charges, 
said he will fight in court to regain control of the gym. In the meantime, he 
wonders how much of a business will be left if the gym remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
Some members want refunds of membership dues, but most, including Steve Rivera, 
just want the doors of the Philadelphia Street gym to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
"I need this gym because bodybuilding is part of my job," said Rivera, 28, a 
former truck driver who now performs with a male strip show and revue. The 
5-foot-9 Rivera works out three hours a day, four days out of five, to maintain 
his 18-inch biceps, 29-inch waist and 26-inch thighs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working out here since the gym's been open," he said. "It's kind of 
like home. A lot of my closest friends train here." 
</P>
<P>
For Rivera and others, the Uptown Gym has become a temple of almost religious 
devotion to exploring the upper limits of biceps expansion and bench pressing, 
without an excess of rules or interference. 
</P>
<P>
"This gym is for serious bodybuilding, as opposed to the chrome-plated, 
light-weighted pseudo-gyms in the area," said tanned, muscular Steve Salazar, 
38, who worked out one or two hours daily with his attractive blond wife, 
Michelle. "It was built by bodybuilders for bodybuilders, not by business for 
making money." 
</P>
<P>
The hard-core membership at Sunday's gathering remains solidly in the camp of 
Bailey, who organized the meeting and would like his job back, even if it means 
remaining the only employee at a gym that is open seven days and 98 hours a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked 400 days in a row without taking a day off," Bailey said proudly. "I 
worked the day of my girlfriend's daughter's wedding. I couldn't get my truck 
registered." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, 40, said he has sold his truck to get money to hire a lawyer and make 
payments on his mobile home. The balding, heavyset former bodybuilder descends 
from one of Whittier's founding families. "Not one Bailey has ever been fired 
from a job," he said. "I don't like this distinction." 
</P>
<P>
Besides being let go, Bailey has other gripes with Asset Forfeiture Services 
Inc., the Corona company appointed by U.S. marshals to oversee the gym. Bailey 
said he has not received his final paycheck and that his three previous 
paychecks arrived anywhere from eight days to three weeks late. He also accused 
the company of repeated mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
The fault for any bad management belongs to Bailey, who will not be rehired, 
said Brian Tanner, the president of Asset Forfeiture Services. In a termination 
letter, Tanner wrote that Bailey refused to follow maintenance and bookkeeping 
instructions, which among other things, resulted in the late paychecks. Tanner 
wrote Bailey that the proverbial last straw was when Bailey did not open the 
gym Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
On that morning, Bailey posted a sign on the gym door reading: "Sorry folks. 
Haven't been paid. No pay, no work. Had to go get rent money. Will open up as 
soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
When Bailey returned several hours later, the locks had been changed. The gym 
has remained closed since. 
</P>
<P>
"Not an ideal situation," was the way U.S. Marshal Craig Meacham described the 
gym controversy. The Uptown Gym has earned only $1,800 over expenses since 
being seized in June, 1989. Meacham said he understood that Bailey agreed to 
work long hours in order to keep the gym open and in the black. 
</P>
<P>
For running a seized business, the government pays management companies, such 
as Asset Forfeiture Services, set monthly fees, ranging from $250 to about 
$1,000, Meacham said. Within the last year, marshals have received and managed 
$226 million worth of property in Los Angeles County, from "oceangoing boats to 
jewelry to gymnasiums," Meacham said. 
</P>
<P>
The gym takeover resulted from a cocaine investigation of co-owner Richard 
Gill, said Sgt. Don Desmaretz of the Whittier Police Department. He said 
officers found two ounces of cocaine and packaging material at Gill's house 
during a raid June 15, 1989. Officers then searched the gym for further 
evidence, and found two ounces of cocaine in co-owner Weaver's gym bag. 
</P>
<P>
The major and unexpected find, however, was illegal steroids.

DOWNEY HISTORY PROTECTED;

<P>
ORDINANCE COVERS JUDGE'S 1911 MANSION, OILMAN'S 1926 HOME AND THE OLDEST 
ORIGINAL MCDONALD'S 
</P>

DOWNEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has given its blessing to a compromise ordinance that would 
protect two historic buildings and a landmark McDonald's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday night to move forward with the ordinance 
despite protests by the company that owns one of the historic sites. A lawyer 
for the company said it would unlawfully deprive the firm of its property 
rights. The ordinance was also attacked by conservationists, who called it a 
watered-down measure that would do little to preserve some of Downey's older 
historic homes. 
</P>
<P>
The council is to consider final approval of the ordinance at its Oct. 9 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would require the city's Planning Commission to hold a public 
hearing and approve requests to demolish any of the three buildings. That way, 
the city could provide incentives to maintain the properties, to move the 
buildings to other locations or to study and document the buildings before they 
are razed, said Ken Farfsing, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance governs only residential properties listed in the National 
Register of Historic Places and non-residential properties that are eligible to 
be included in the register. 
</P>
<P>
Only three properties in Downey fit that description. 
</P>
<P>
The Rives mansion on the northwest corner of Paramount Boulevard and 3rd Street 
is in the register. The late Superior Court Judge James C. Rives built the 
mansion in 1911. It resembles a Southern manse, with large white Greek columns. 
Mary Hendricks and her daughter, Jane, own the house. 
</P>
<P>
Casa de Parley Johnson, an L-shaped house on Florence Avenue, is also in the 
register. The two-story Spanish Colonial Revival residence was built in 1926 by 
the noted Southern California architect Roland A. Coate for a prominent citrus 
grower and oilman, Parley Johnson. The house has been owned by the Assistance 
League of Downey, a philanthropic group established in 1953, since Mrs. Parley 
(Gypsy) Johnson donated it to the league. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of those two properties did not object to the council action Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
But strong protests came from the owner of the property that is home to the 
historic McDonald's on the southwest corner of Florence Avenue and Lakewood 
Boulevard. Pep Boys, the auto accessories firm, owns the lot and leases it to 
McDonald's franchise owner Roger Williams. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the federal government declared the oldest original McDonald's 
eligible to be listed in the register as an artifact of the 1950s. The outlet, 
which opened in 1953, has golden arches that light up at night and a tall neon 
sign with a scurrying, winking figure in a chef's outfit. 
</P>
<P>
A Marin County architect nominated the McDonald's for preservation, much to the 
chagrin of Pep Boys, which never consented to have the site included in the 
National Register of Historic Places. Private property can be nominated and 
found eligible but cannot be included in the register without the owner's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
Inclusion on the register brings tax benefits. Although it does not usually 
deter a property owner from demolishing a structure, being on the register 
creates a public relations problem that makes it difficult for an owner to tear 
down a historic building. 
</P>
<P>
When the 40-year McDonald lease expires in 1993, the owner may want to use the 
property for other purposes, said Stanley William Lamport, an attorney 
representing Pep Boys. He said the ordinance would unfairly require Pep Boys to 
seek permission to alter the property and, possibly, to perform expensive 
studies to satisfy the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever reason you use to justify (the ordinance), it's a physical taking of 
property," Lamport said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Roy L. Paul, who cast the dissenting vote Tuesday night, said that 
state and federal officials deemed the hamburger outlet to be historic and that 
it should be covered by the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Paul voted against the ordinance after the council majority decided that homes 
found eligible for the register would not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you need to preserve residences as well," Paul said. "It's only half 
an ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, only homes were considered by the council when it broached the idea 
of establishing a preservation ordinance in the summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Former Councilman Randall R. Barb introduced the idea of an ordinance after a 
property owner had approached city officials about demolishing a home built in 
the early 1900s, Farfsing said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's old homes are on large lots. City officials feared that 
owners would tear them down and build several homes in their place. 
</P>
<P>
The council imposed a moratorium requiring the owners of 23 houses to get a 
permit from the Planning Commission before demolishing them. The houses were at 
least 50 years old. The Rives mansion and Casa de Parley Johnson were on the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few months, the proposed ordinance was modified to exclude the 
other homes and to include McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert G. Cormack said he would still like to see the city pass an 
ordinance to protect historic homes. 
</P>
<P>
But the city, not the property owner, should bear the burden of preserving 
history, he said: "We as a City Council need to make certain that the majority 
of the people in Downey want it badly enough that we spend public funds to do 
it. The city should buy or underwrite the costs."

COMMUNITY DIGEST: MONTEBELLO; 
</P>
<P>
LEADERS CALL FIRST MEETING ON GANG DIVERSION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Business and community leaders, as well as school, church, city and law 
enforcement officials, will meet at 7 tonight in the community room at Rio 
Hondo Regional Library in the first of a series of brainstorming sessions to 
develop a gang diversion program. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William Molinari, who is organizing the meeting, said that although 
Montebello has a successful Drug Awareness Resistance Education (DARE) program 
at all the schools in the Montebello Unified school district, more is needed to 
ensure that children stay out of gangs.

"It seems every day we read about another shooting in the area," he said. 
"Though we don't have serious gang crime problems here, we can't sit back and 
expect that it will last forever. Sheriff's officials tell me that once a child 
has joined a gang it's almost impossible to get them out. We need to make sure 
they never get in." 
</P>
<P>
Molinari said that by bringing a cross section of the community together, he 
hopes the city can come up with a sound, well-rounded gang diversion plan.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: CERRITOS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL RAISES QUESTIONS ON STATE HOUSING MANDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission and city staff have been asked by the City Council to 
wrestle with a litany of questions about such things as how Cerritos can 
finance affordable housing and whether it can govern the sale of such homes. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, Cerritos must begin setting aside 20% of its redevelopment tax 
money in 1995 to provide low- and moderate-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has no plans on how it will meet the state mandate, although 
the council discussed the issue at its meeting last week for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of things we did not know," Mayor Ann Joynt said. "Primarily, 
we did not know what was legal." 
</P>
<P>
If the city does build affordable housing, some council members have said they 
want the sale of the homes restricted to Cerritos residents. 
</P>
<P>
The staff and Planning Commission will research the questions and report back 
to the council. No date was set on when they would make their report.

<P>
COUNCIL STUDIES ALLOWING ALCOHOL AT CITY FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decision on whether to allow alcoholic beverages to be served at city 
facilities was postponed Tuesday night by the Hawaiian Gardens City Council. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution before the council would, if adopted, allow groups renting the 
Robert E. Lee and Lee Ware activity centers to serve alcohol as long as the 
renters pay for security officers and provide a $300,000 liability insurance 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council has not yet decided whether security would be provided by 
the Sheriff's Department or a private security company, said Lt. Henry 
Villanueva, sheriff's liaison officer for Hawaiian Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers used would not be our local officers," Villanueva said. "We don't 
pull a patrolman off the street for a special event." 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be any problems if there are the proper safeguards," said Leonard 
Chaidez, director of recreation. "I'd like to check out other cities that allow 
alcohol in their facilities: Do they have any problems?" 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to vote on the resolution at its Oct. 9 meeting.

<P>
POLICE CHIEF TO LEAVE FOR SIMILAR JOB IN PLACENTIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Chief Manuel Ortega is leaving Bell to become police chief in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, a policeman for 21 years in Orange County until he went to Bell in 
1988, will replace former Chief Harold Fischer, who retired in June. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega will start his new job Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bill Talbott, who has been with the Bell Police Department for 17 years, 
said Ortega brought stability to the department as the city struggled with 
financial problems. "He kind of kept us on an even keel," Talbott said. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega helped start such programs in Bell as Operation Off the Wall, a graffiti 
cleanup program that attracted 950 volunteers in March, and another program 
that uses police reserves to patrol city parks on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Bramble credited Ortega with expanding the city's drug 
enforcement investigation team. He also improved the department's image by 
encouraging officers to become active in professional organizations and by 
establishing more standard training programs, Bramble said. "My goal was that 
Manny let the outside world know that we had a professional police department 
and that it was full of top, qualified people," Bramble said. "From that 
perspective, he accomplished that goal."

JUDGE REFUSES TO REINSTATE THERAPY LICENSE FOR DOYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judith M. Doyle, a well-known activist in the gay and lesbian community of Long 
Beach, has lost a last-ditch effort to have her license to practice family 
therapy reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
The license was revoked in July following allegations that Doyle had been 
involved in a sexual relationship with a female client in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Edward Ross rejected arguments by 
Doyle's attorney, Peter J. Zomber, that the personal relationship had not begun 
until after the therapeutic relationship ended. The ethical standards for 
therapists at the time, he argued, did not prohibit such a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we're not happy," Zomber said following the judge's ruling.

<TEXT>
<P>
When I first heard about the Victoria Pub, I pictured waitresses in saucy 
costumes slinging tankards of beer to boisterous customers. Then, when I called 
to ask about reservations, I was assured by the cheerful British voice on the 
phone that the bar served "pub grub" at all hours. I almost stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
But I'd invited my mother to have dinner with the kids and my husband, and she 
loved the idea of an English restaurant. I'm glad we went with her instincts. 
The restaurant does have something of a theme quality to it, but it also has a 
measure of authenticity and earnestness that I found appealing. 
</P>
<P>
The bar is patterned after an English pub, and judging from the liveliness of 
the crowd, it has succeeded in becoming a "neighborhood" social scene -- in 
spite of being located right in the middle of a shopping center. There's even a 
dart room where the competition is quite intense. (Bring your own darts, but 
remember, Monday is league night.) 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant has an entirely different mood from the bar. With heavy rose 
curtains, upholstered chairs and wood paneling everywhere, it has the subdued 
elegance of an English gentlemen's club. And the menu is as English as the 
ambience. 
</P>
<P>
I fell in love with the sounds of the kiddie menu: "Captain Pigwash fish 
fingers," "small bangers with bubbles" and "crumble of the day." 
</P>
<P>
The adult fare, however, was somewhat harder to judge. The salad, for instance, 
tasted quite peculiar, as if the vinegar had been left out. Was this 
authentically English and therefore acceptable? The vegetables, on the other 
hand, were beautifully cooked. Aren't the English supposed to overcook their 
vegetables? 
</P>
<P>
Smoked salmon with wheat toast and dill mayonnaise was lovely, and the Brie 
baked in puff pastry and served with jam and fresh fruit was singularly 
satisfying. The soups were marvelous. A carrot soup with coriander and the 
pleasant texture of pureed carrots was delicious. And a chicken soup with 
mushrooms was exquisitely flavored with a touch of sherry. 
</P>
<P>
Steak and onion pie, while not quite a pie (it had a layer of puff pastry 
perched on top) was a decent meal of beef chunks in dark gravy with mashed 
potatoes and vegetables on the side. This and the Cornish pasty would certainly 
satisfy one's appetite for good, plain, honest food. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken Piccadilly was a potent, Caribbean-inspired dish with a sweet sauce 
full of banana bites, corn bits and rum-flavored cream. Beef salad consisted of 
thin rolls of sliced cold roast beef on a bed of crisp salad and vegetables. I 
really liked the salad that came with the beef, although it floated on a lake 
of soy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
My mother ordered the best meal of all. She had the Somerset lamb, a perfectly 
cooked, generous portion of lamb -- a steak, not a chop -- with a hearty mint 
sauce on the side. And just to prove it hadn't been a fluke, she also ordered 
the best dessert -- out of a lineup of very good ones. She had the crumble of 
the day, a fresh fruit cobbler, which happened to be rhubarb -- her favorite. 
Hot, slightly tart fruit covered with sweet, crunchy "crumbles" in a bowl of 
cream. She finished with an excellent pot of tea, then insisted that her skill 
in ordering well was the result of a trip to London. I think she was just 
lucky, but I'm taking her back to the restaurant next time I go.

The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently 
visited by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
The flowing hot springs at Wheeler have drawn people to their therapeutic 
ambience since the early 1800s. Today you can enjoy them along with a massage 
and a fine dinner. Or go for the dinner alone; it's worth it. The menu changes 
every week and the vegetables and herbs come from the restaurant's own gardens. 
The Restaurant at Wheeler Hot Springs is located at 16825 Maricopa Highway, 
(805) 646-8131. Dinner is served 5 to 9:30 p.m. Thursday through Sunday, and 
Sunday Brunch is 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Dinner for two, food only, $52 to $68. 
</P>
<P>
The Sportsman Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge is a throwback to the 1950s and 
'60s when it was one of the "special occasion" restaurants in Ventura. Although 
its prices might have changed with the times, the quality of its steaks and 
chops has not. The Sportsman is at 53 S. California St., Ventura, 643-2851. 
Open 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday, 9 
a.m. to 2 p.m. for breakfast and lunch, and 5 to 10 p.m. for dinner Sunday. 
Lunch for two, food only, $12-$20. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$46. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Jag's India House call their Northern Indian cooking "royal Mogul 
cuisine." The hot fresh breads alone are worth the trip to the restaurant. 
There are dozens of versions of curries, from shrimp masala to a lamb rogan 
josh. Jag's India House, 860 Hampshire Road, suite U, Westlake Village, 
373-6266. Lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday through Friday; dinner 5:30 to 
10 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Wine and beer. Parking lot. MasterCard and 
Visa. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$50. 
</P>
<P>
MK's is hot and cold. Hot in that it's frequently packed, cool as an oasis on a 
summer afternoon. Some dishes are very, very good, notably the seafood Vera 
Cruz and the "grazing platter" of grilled vegetables. MK's is at 139 Ojai Ave., 
Ojai, 640-8001. Breakfast 8 to 11 a.m. Monday, and Wednesday through Friday, 8 
a.m. to noon Saturday and Sunday; lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday, and 
Wednesday through Friday, noon to 2:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday; dinner 5 to 10 
p.m. Wednesday through Monday. Meal for two, food only, $26-$58.

GRAND JURY WON'T RULE ON PARKING GARAGE DISPUTE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Grand Jury has decided not to get involved in a 
longstanding dispute between Monterey Park and several residents over a parking 
garage, city officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the City Council asked the Grand Jury to look into residents' 
complaints that a new parking structure at Garvey Medical Center violates the 
city's three-story maximum for that area. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say it is legal because it is a parking structure, not a 
commercial building, and is exempt from the three-story rule. 
</P>
<P>
But the Grand Jury's government operations committee said that although it 
found no misconduct when the city approved construction of the parking garage, 
ruling on its legality is not within its jurisdiction, Mayor Judy Chu said. 
Grand Jury officials could not be reached for comment.

A NEW VOCATION; 
</P>
<P>
A CAREER IN PRO WRESTLING BEHIND HIM, BILL OLIVAS IS PREPARING TO BECOME A 
PRIEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that he's finished wrestling with 250-pound men, Ojai's Bill Olivas is 
preparing to grapple with some heavyweight theological issues. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month the 69-year-old former wrestler, known to his fans as the Wild 
Man of Borneo, or Elephant Boy, was accepted as a novice by the Order of St. 
Augustine. A deacon at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in Ojai for 13 years, Olivas 
is preparing to be ordained as a priest there next August. 
</P>
<P>
As he sat behind his desk in the church rectory, a Bible to his left, to his 
right a photo of himself crushing a sweaty opponent in a headlock, Olivas 
recalled the improbable route he took to get where he is today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably be the only former wrestler to become a priest," he said. At 5 
feet, 10 1/2 inches tall and 240 pounds, with a friendly demeanor and a teddy 
bear face, Olivas can convincingly pass as a member of either vocation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I figure if the Good Lord has a plan for you it's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Ojai, Olivas comes from a long line of Ventura County Olivases. 
Olivas Park was named after his great-great-grandfather Raymundo, a soldier in 
the Mexican army. 
</P>
<P>
Olivas attended Villanova Preparatory School, an affiliate of St. Thomas 
Aquinas Church, and upon graduation enrolled at Los Angeles College, a Catholic 
school that has since closed. Throughout his school years Olivas had dual 
interests: religion and combat sports. 
</P>
<P>
While Olivas was attending college, World War II broke out and he enlisted in 
the Army. He served as an assistant chaplain and as a combat engineer, and 
participated in the invasion of Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
While stationed in England, Olivas was introduced to wrestling. "We had nine 
months of training before the invasion and that's when I became interested in 
body building," he said. "That's when I became acquainted with pro wrestlers." 
</P>
<P>
One of those wrestlers was fellow soldier Bobby Coleman, who had discovered 
that money could be made by flinging people around in the nearby town of 
Southampton. Olivas began working out with Coleman and accompanying him to his 
Friday night fights at a local club. 
</P>
<P>
"One night Coleman's opponent didn't show up so he came over to draft me to 
fight with him so he wouldn't lose out on the money," Olivas said. "He was 
making 70 pounds, $210 in our money, and that was a lot for a private. It was 
about a 10-minute match. It went pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
It went well enough that Olivas was booked to fight every Friday night, thus 
beginning a journey that would take him all the way to Gorgeous George, and on 
to God. 
</P>
<P>
After the war ended, Olivas returned to Ojai intending to go back to school, 
"but at that time it seemed very dull," he said. "I was very nervous trying to 
sit still in Ojai. Wrestling was a kind of way to get rid of the tension. It 
was the challenge of combat." 
</P>
<P>
So he contacted Coleman, who was then wrestling in Chicago, and asked for help 
in establishing a full-fledged wrestling career. 
</P>
<P>
It was the mid-1940s, the heyday of wrestling, and Olivas soon found himself 
battling it out with the best in the profession, in big-time venues like 
Madison Square Garden and, eventually, on television. To enhance his 
entertainment value, Olivas was given ring aliases and he frizzed his hair. 
</P>
<P>
While wrestling in Arizona, Olivas met his wife, Marcia, a nurse and dietitian 
who died in 1988. After their marriage in 1961, the couple went to Europe, 
where wrestling was especially popular. Olivas made a nice salary -- $5,000 per 
month, plus 10% of all gate receipts. He was hardly a fan favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans were very hostile toward me. In European countries they naturally 
supported their home guy," he said. "The greatest damage came from the fans. 
They'd throw everything from drinks to tomatoes." 
</P>
<P>
The action inside the ring got pretty hairy too. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some broken bones, cracked ribs. Once in London I got four cracked ribs 
from a body slam," he said. "One time I was wrestling Lou Thesz, the United 
States champion. I drop-kicked him and he lost most of his teeth." 
</P>
<P>
When he wasn't wrestling, Olivas was going from spa to spa with his wife, 
studying the therapeutic uses of the facilities. Soon after the couple ended 
their three-year stay in Europe and returned to Ojai, they took over management 
of the historic Matilija Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came back, the place was running into some problems and the county 
wanted to lease it out to a private individual," he said, "so we leased it from 
the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, the county had taken over the sulfur hot springs, which had been 
privately held, for flood control purposes and as a recreational facility. 
Matilija Dam, as it turned out, never did overflow as had been anticipated, so 
in 1964 the county decided to lease the springs to private operators. 
</P>
<P>
The Olivases ran Matilija Hot Springs until the county reclaimed it in 1987 and 
put it up for auction. Business had been slow, a forest fire had damaged their 
property in 1985, and county administrators wanted to put public money into 
other park properties. 
</P>
<P>
From the days of the Chumash Indians until 1947, the sulfur springs had been 
thought to have therapeutic properties. Olivas and his wife reopened the spa to 
people who had arthritis and general aches and pains, with particular interest 
in the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Through his work Olivas became involved with St. Thomas Aquinas Church. In 
1977, he was ordained as a permanent deacon, continuing his work with sick and 
elderly people and taking over the job of business manager for the church. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the county took back the hot springs, Marcia Olivas had a heart 
attack from which she never recovered. After her death in 1988, Olivas turned 
his attentions entirely to the church. 
</P>
<P>
"It filled a great void," he said. "I was going through a grieving process. We 
were very close to each other. We had been married 27 years." 
</P>
<P>
For the past year Olivas has had a trial run at life as an Augustinian priest. 
He has lived on church grounds with the three priests there, sharing everything 
from meals to prayer. After his novitiate year is over Olivas will take the 
vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. 
</P>
<P>
Olivas concedes that it will be a dramatic change in lifestyle, but said he 
does not expect any difficulty adjusting to life totally revolving around the 
church. "Wrestling was very good to me. It gave us everything, happiness and 
all that, but I don't have too much to give up. I'm sure the calling was there 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UP CLOSE: BILL OLIVAS 
</P>
<P>
Vocation: Deacon (Formerly a wrestler, soon to be a priest.) 
</P>
<P>
Most weight lifted: Bench-pressed 375 pounds at age 20. "It was almost double 
my weight at the time. I was a pretty good weightlifter in my day. Of course, 
the body doesn't look it now. The chest has dropped." 
</P>
<P>
Favorite sermon topic: "On Whose Side Are We On?" (God's or the world's.) 
</P>
<P>
Favorite wrestling fans: Those in Papeete, Tahiti. "They thought I was a god 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Record against wrestling great Gorgeous George: Three wins, five losses. "The 
girls whistled at him, the guys got mad. I was a popular guy when I fought 
against him -- the fans wanted me to beat him."

A CHANCE TO GET INVOLVED IN WHAT WAS ONCE THE 'SILVER-HAIRED LEGISLATURE,' AND 
MALL-WALKING PROGRAMS.

<P>
There's still time to let your three California Senior Legislature 
representatives know what concerns you want raised at the organization's 10th 
annual session. 
</P>
<P>
The 120-member California Senior Legislature will convene at the state Capitol 
in Sacramento Oct. 15-18. Anyone interested may attend and testify before any 
of the 10 committees that will be hearing proposed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ventura Senior Assemblywoman Maxine Culp, 67, the CSL is a vocal 
advocate for the more than 4.2 million elderly citizens in California. "The CSL 
has been very effective in bringing the top legislative priorities of the 
elderly of this state to the attention of the state Legislature and the 
governor and in getting these priorities signed into law," Culp said. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was created 10 years ago, the CSL has had up to a 75% success rate in 
getting its proposed legislation enacted into law. Now failure to report 
elderly or dependent-adult abuse is a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gaynes, 78, is the county's senior senator. A resident of Camarillo, 
Gaynes said the two top local concerns are the need for an affordable 
health-care system and transportation for the elderly. Ventura County's other 
senior assembly member, 74-year-old Lee Strohbehn of Ojai, said health care was 
the No. 1 issue at last year's session. 
</P>
<P>
Originally called the "Silver-Haired Legislature," the CSL was modeled on the 
California Legislature, with 40 senior senators and 80 members of the Senior 
Assembly. There are similar organizations in 24 states. Volunteer members are 
registered voters over the age of 60 who have been elected by their peers 
through area agencies on aging. 
</P>
<P>
CSL representatives seek members in the state Legislature to author bills and 
to advocate the adoption of priority legislation. They also meet with senior 
constituents in their areas to draft age-related bills for consideration at the 
CSL session. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the legislators develop local senior advocacy policy, testify at 
hearings, activate letter or phone campaigns and coordinate fund-raising 
activities on the local level for the group. 
</P>
<P>
The CSL is sponsored by the California Commission on Aging and is funded mainly 
by contributions to the California Fund for Senior Citizens -- up to $325,000 
annually -- via state income tax returns. The balance from taxpayer 
contributions goes to direct senior service programs selected by the state 
Commission on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Varvaroff, special projects coordinator at the state commission, said 
that in recent years they were able to fund mobile dental services for the 
bedridden, peer mental health counseling programs and emergency response 
systems with excess CSL funds. Last year, they provided $75,000 for elderly 
victims of the San Francisco earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"One gentleman in his 70s told me that the Senior Legislature had changed his 
life," Varvaroff said. "Before then, he'd never gotten involved in politics. He 
proved that citizens can be involved at any age and make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Health Tip: You don't have to participate in the County's Senior Olympics to 
get in shape. Try walking. The large shopping malls open early for this 
purpose. With a controlled climate and level surfaces, malls provide a safe, 
comfortable place to walk alone or in groups. 
</P>
<P>
If you need motivation, join a mall-walking program at little or no cost. 
Members sign in on arrival and learn how to check their heart rate before and 
during exercise. They also receive incentive awards and are eligible for 
discounts on walking shoes at certain stores. 
</P>
<P>
Watch out for Vivian Pohler whooshing by wearing her 500-mile visor award. The 
68-year-old "trains" at the Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks, where two laps equal a 
mile. More than 700 miles and 18 months ago, Pohler was newly widowed and would 
become breathless after a few steps. Since she became a "Heart for Seniors 
Mall-Waltzer," her health and mood have improved greatly. "Now I climb the 
escalator steps for fun," Pohler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
Schedules of hearings and copies of proposed legislation are available at the 
office of the California Commission on Aging, 1020 9th St., Room 260, 
Sacramento 95814, (916) 322-5630. For information locally, call 482-7085 or

VIDEO DISCOVERY: 'MIRACLE MILE' A REEL BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood has always had a weird love affair with The Bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Since the weapon's infamous introduction at Alamogordo, N.M., in 1945 and 
during the 40-plus years of Cold War tension that followed, nukes have been the 
subject of numerous films -- some good, some bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Miracle Mile" is among the select few -- "Dr. Strangelove," "On the Beach," 
"Testament," "The Bedford Incident," "Fail Safe" -- that are nuclear 
apocalyptic standouts. 
</P>
<P>
The film in many ways resembles the mood of William Friedkin's quirky "After 
Midnight." And like "After Midnight," the bulk of the film's action takes place 
in the wee hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director Steve DeJarnatt, who wrote the script more than 10 years ago, 
uses Los Angeles as ground zero. And from the opening frame, coupled with 
Tangerine Dream's electronic soundtrack, the film's ominous mood builds to an 
unforgetable climax. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Washello (Anthony Edwards), a struggling jazz trombonist, mistakenly 
receives a call at 4 a.m. in a phone booth from a missile silo worker. The 
caller frantically tells Harry that missiles have been launched and World War 
III is an hour away. 
</P>
<P>
Dazed and confused, Harry takes off to get his girl, Julie (Mare Winningham). 
Planning to meet others who are trying to get out of the city, Harry and Julie 
make their way to a helicopter-rendezvous point atop the Mutual Benefit Life 
Building in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A sort of new-wave nuke film, "Miracle Mile" is intense, humorous and powerful. 
And, yeah, it's also sometimes off the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R.

A spoof of all those Errol Flynn pirate movies. The pirates say "Arrrgh!" a lot 
and tend to get their peg-legs stuck in the grills over the hatches. And this 
time it's Burt Lancaster who gets to be gallant as hell. MIKE FLAGG

"Things Change" (1988), directed by David Mamet. 100 minutes. Rated R. An 
Italian shoemaker (Don Ameche) agrees to take the rap for a mob hit, but gets 
one last fling with the low-level Mafioso (Joe Mantegna) assigned to protect 
him. 
</P>
<P>
It's a comic tarantella with a soft-shoe style, and lots of little moments that 
make up for sentimental excesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating. Among 
the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is said 
to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. It's intentionally 
spare and direct, but there's wit in the script: the alien turns out to be a 
vegetable, of all things. MARK CHALON SMITH

No rating. A moving, foot-stomping, hand-clapping chronicle of the final 
appearance of the Weavers -- Lee Hays, Pete Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred 
Hellerman -- probably America's most memorable folk-singing group. MIKE SPENCER

HUMAN RIGHTS POSTERS MAKE SOME TIMELY PLEAS IN SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Cathy Curtis covers art for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does it take to open your mind, shock you into action or at least make you 
sympathize with a cause? Can words and pictures on a poster do the job? Well, 
the artists who anonymously produce this form of cheap, mass-produced, 
throwaway art have never stopped believing in the good work they do. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibit of 102 human rights posters at Rancho Santiago College Art Gallery 
offers an excellent introduction to the diverse ways in which often highly 
unpopular political issues have been presented to broad audiences around the 
globe during the past couple of decades -- as well as to the issues themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the exhibit is dead on: In today's climate of close-minded 
conservatism and increasing hate crimes, human rights remain on the critical 
list. 
</P>
<P>
A sheaf of notes and an essay by Carol A. Wells, executive director of the 
Center for the Study of Political Graphics and co-curator of the show (with 
galley director Mayde Herberg) adds vital perspective and information -- 
particularly for younger viewers who may draw a blank at such names as Julius 
and Ethel Rosenberg, Marian Anderson, Joseph McCarthy and James Bakke. The 
posters in the show are clustered, regardless of date, according to familiar 
themes: apartheid in South Africa; U.S.-aided right-wing government attacks on 
Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans; the internment of American Japanese 
during World War II; anti-Communist witch hunts in the United States during the 
1950s; anti-Semitism; capital punishment; land rights for American Indians; the 
civil rights movement; women's issues; AIDS; poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the posters make their appeal based on the oppression of victims, other 
messages sharply accuse the viewer of indifference and still others celebrate 
heroic leaders. Cliched but immediately recognizable imagery -- frequently of 
mothers and children, people raising clenched fists or proud-looking women with 
flowing hair -- dominates many posters; others make use of sophisticated 
graphics and arty layouts. While the audience for one poster may be barely 
literate, another is assumed to be capable of following a lengthy text with 
complex arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The posters were produced for reasons that actually have more in common with 
the motivations of commercial advertising than with the traditional, 
contemplative sphere of art. To say which posters represent the most effective 
combinations of text and imagery, you would have to know for what audiences 
they were intended. 
</P>
<P>
As a white, female, educated, middle-class American, I gravitated to the 
posters that most closely duplicate the approach of Madison Avenue -- the 
language of manipulation with which I'm most familiar, with its penchant for 
impressive statistics, snappy prose and riveting, one-shot images. Among them 
are: 
</P>
<P>
* Keith Haring's AIDS poster, "Ignorance Equals Fear," with its trio of "see 
no/hear no/speak no evil" yellow cartoon figures and the striking pink triangle 
logo developed by Act Up. 
</P>
<P>
* Sheila Levrant de Bretteville's self-portrait with a branch tattooed over her 
missing breast, lost to cancer ("I am no longer afraid of mirrors"). 
</P>
<P>
* The Guerrilla Girls' "Do women have to be naked to get into the Metropolitan 
Museum?" (a photograph of a famous nude by Ingres wearing the underground 
women's artists group trademark guerrilla head, with statistics about the 
number of female artists represented at the Met, and the number of female 
nudes). 
</P>
<P>
* The Simon Wiesenthal Center's Holocaust reminder, with its photograph of 
bitter mementos from the prison camps and literate text. 
</P>
<P>
* "Whatever happened to . . . ," a sea of blank white silhouettes in a school 
portrait, recalling government-sanctioned, CIA-supported eradication of unarmed 
Guatemalan civilians. 
</P>
<P>
* Lynn Okun's image of a map of Africa superimposed on a facet of a diamond 
ring: "Some dream of diamonds, others of equality. Diamonds are forever. Africa 
is now!" 
</P>
<P>
* Susan Ocona's "Alone Invisible Homeless," a black poster with the barely 
discernible black image of a homeless family. 
</P>
<P>
But even the most homespun or hackneyed image in this show is rooted in human 
rage, despair or celebration, and a powerful conviction that the world can be 
changed for the better. The sheer moral force of all these images make the show 
exceptional in our confused and callous times.

RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON: TEPPAN COOKING: SPECTACLE IN NEAR-CLASSICAL SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Buena Park's new Tokyo Steak is a suavely masculine establishment, filled with 
a quiet crowd of Japanese businessmen who would look equally at home in Tokyo's 
Roppongi district, where good red meat, and practically anything else Western, 
is available at astronomical prices. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant features teppan cooking, which is done on a flat metal grill. 
This style of cooking gained popularity in Japan early in the century. It 
became wildly popular in this country about 20 years ago, in large part because 
of a chain called Benihana of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Steak may strike you as a clone of Benihana; it isn't. The restaurant is 
charming and discreet. The square room has high ceilings and light gray 
wallpaper offset by red wooden slats. Two giant canvas murals depicting 
medieval samurai life, hand painted to resemble mock woodblock prints, add an 
almost classical air. The grills, with their glossy, overhanging hoods, are so 
spotless you can see your reflection in them. 
</P>
<P>
You might want to relax before dinner at the sushi bar, which is simple and 
attractive, with a large selection of fresh fish prepared by an authentic 
Japanese sushi man. I mention nationality because the staff here is 
international. The hostess hails from Mexico, and our teppan chef one night 
turned out to be Thai. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes time for dinner, you'll be seated around one of the large metal 
grills. A kimono-clad waitress, who almost certainly will be from Japan, will 
take your order. Then you will have to wait for the chef to make his entrance. 
</P>
<P>
While you wait, the waitress will try to sell you some silly drinks (named 
banzai and geisha, adorned with little umbrellas) and a few a la carte 
appetizers. I recommend patience instead. The tempura -- battered fish and 
vegetables -- is leaden and greasy. Shrimp cocktail, a big hit in Japan, is no 
better than what you would get at a coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
But patience is handsomely rewarded. Eventually the chef comes over with a 
grand flourish and fires the grill, which makes a great big whoosh like a 747 
when the gas jets are turned on. And by the time he has finished, he has made 
the best teppan food around. 
</P>
<P>
First he tosses a few shrimp deftly onto the grill, dousing them with a garlic 
soy and scooping them onto your plate with a spatula. These complimentary 
shrimp appetizers are far better than any of the menu appetizers. They come 
with a rose pink, sweetly flavored mayonnaise, and are as fresh as can be. I 
would have been happy to make a meal of them. 
</P>
<P>
Then the real show begins. Onions, mushrooms, zucchini and bean sprouts are 
thrown on the grill, all of them doused with dark sauces. Then comes the meat 
of your choice -- filet mignon, New York steak, say, or chicken, scallops or 
lobster. Should you choose beef, as most people here do, just specify how you 
like it cooked and your wish will be granted. My meats were cooked exactly as I 
asked, every time I dined here. 
</P>
<P>
The beef, particularly the filet mignon, is particularly wonderful. The chef 
dices it into little cubes that are so tender they practically melt when you 
pop them into your mouth. You can dip the cubes into the soy-based dipping 
sauce, if you like, but this meat is so good that it deserves to stand on its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you don't want beef, there is plenty of choice here. Lemon chicken 
-- chopped chicken sauteed with lemon and garlic and topped with toasted sesame 
seeds -- is another good bet. It is a far cry from the sweet, battered lemon 
chicken served in Chinese restaurants. This chicken is pungent and spicy, 
without batter, and the grilling brings out the flavor of the meat surprisingly 
well. Eat it with the deep red, Korean-style chili paste that the chef will 
smear onto your plate if you ask him to. 
</P>
<P>
The scallops are wonderfully fresh here, too, and go perfectly with a ginger 
dipping sauce. I didn't try either of the other two entrees. After the shrimp 
appetizer, the shrimp seemed redundant, and the lobster (served with filet 
mignon on a special dinner they call the Fuji) seemed rather expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Steak serves the grilled vegetables that accompany the meats in larger 
pieces than those that are served at Benihana, and all the natural essences are 
retained in the grilling process. They are just great. You are also offered 
carrot rice -- a bowl of Japanese rice cooked in a chicken stock with little 
bits of grated carrot. It's soft and fluffy, which is more that I can say for 
rice I've had at Benihana. 
</P>
<P>
What the restaurant needs now is a bigger crowd. Teppan rooms are more fun when 
they are busy, and things are a bit too quiet for comfort here. On the other 
hand, the quiet almost makes you think you are dining in Tokyo. Until you get 
the bill, of course. In Buena Park, you can still get a good piece of meat for 
considerably less than a hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Steak is moderately expensive. Appetizers are $4.75 to $5.25. Complete 
dinners are $11.95 to $23.75.

WOULD MCA DEAL PROMPT CHANGES IN TV RULES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans are used to buying Japanese electronics, German cars and French wine. 
A good chunk of Madison Avenue is now owned by British advertising agencies. 
And many Wall Street financial service firms have aligned themselves with big 
European investment banks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, prime-time shows such as "Murder, She Wrote," "thirtysomething" and "Uncle 
Buck" could join the growing list of American-made products that Americans no 
longer own. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if Matsushita Electric succeeds in buying MCA Inc., and if Italian 
financier Giancarlo Parretti completes his purchase of MGM/UA Communications, 
more than one-third of the prime-time shows that Americans watch will be made 
by foreign-controlled companies. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure earlier this week that Matsushita is in talks to acquire the 
parent of Universal Studios sent a lightning bolt through Washington, where the 
networks and Hollywood studios face each other in an intensive lobbying 
campaign over the so-called financial interest and syndication rules. 
</P>
<P>
Those rules, which were adopted 20 years ago by the Federal Communications 
Commission, prohibit the networks from owning a financial interest in shows 
they license from studios and independent producers and from selling lucrative 
reruns to local stations. The rules are designed, in part, to protect program 
producers from the networks extorting program syndication rights in exchange 
for slots on their prime-time schedules. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, CBS and NBC are limited to owning shows they make themselves -- such as 
CBS' "60 Minutes" -- but the shows are not big money earners in the 
international market place. Fox, the newest broadcast network, operates under a 
temporary waiver of the fin/syn rules. 
</P>
<P>
Although American workers might be growing accustomed to Japanese workplace 
methods in car plants, TV viewers have not seen any changes to the pat formulas 
of prime-time entertainment shows as a result of foreign ownership. Already 
companies such as Columbia Pictures, which was bought by Sony Corp. last year, 
and 20th Century Fox, owned by Rupert Murdoch's Australian-based News Corp., 
are in foreign hands. Independent TV producers MTM Entertainment (maker of Burt 
Reynolds' new show "Evening Shade"), is owned by Television South, and Reeves 
("Doctor, Doctor") is owned by Thames Television. Both are British companies. 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief assets of a movie studio are the syndication rights to hit 
network programs. The studios collectively gross hundreds of millions of 
dollars annually by selling the reruns of hit shows to local TV stations in the 
United States as well as to foreign broadcasters. The overseas market for 
American TV shows is the fastest-growing sector of the syndication business. 
</P>
<P>
The networks, however, under the current fin/syn rules, are banned from 
negotiating for the foreign distribution rights to TV programs they do not 
already 100% own. A repeal or relaxation of that rule could mean significant 
new revenue for the networks, whose core business has come under considerable 
pressure due to viewer erosion. 
</P>
<P>
"What this underscores is the total preposterous nature of U.S. government 
rules that prohibit us from being actors in the global marketplace," said 
Richard Cotten, senior vice president at NBC and the network's chief strategist 
in its campaign to overturn the fin/syn rules. "We are prohibited from going 
abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment, particularly the production of TV programs and theatrical films, 
is a valuable export commodity for the United States -- it's one of the few 
manufacturing categories, along with with the aerospace industry, where this 
country runs a trade surplus rather than deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But with the studios increasingly coming under foreign ownership, lucrative TV 
syndication profits will now be reaped by non-U.S. companies. That has network 
executives in a dither since they are effectively barred from a business 
allowed their foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The networks insist they do not want to block the foreign invasion of Hollywood 
-- only to be allowed to compete in overseas networks along with foreign 
companies -- despite network lobbying tactics that some thought were in poor 
taste. Hollywood executives still bristle when they remember that NBC sent 
pizzas to members of Congress after Parretti announced that he wanted to buy 
MGM/UA, a gesture that to some bordered on jingoism, if not racism.

WHAT CHANGE IN FILM RATING SYSTEM MEANS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: ADULT-THEMED FILMS CAN NOW BE MADE AND MARKETED WITHOUT THE STIGMA OF 
THE X. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, TIMES FILM EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When pornographers took the Motion Picture Assn. of America's adults-only X 
rating, multiplied it by three ("XXX!!!) and made it the beacon for fans of 
love stories without love, they gave MPAA President Jack Valenti's voluntary 
movie ratings system a flat tire. On Wednesday, after a decade of controversy, 
prodding and a couple of lawsuits, Valenti got out and changed the tire. 
</P>
<P>
The X rating is now called NC-17. Same category, same meaning -- no children 
under 17 admitted -- but without the taint. Filmmakers can now make movies with 
adult themes aimed at adult audiences, and distributors will be able to market 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going back to the original intent of the rating system," Valenti said 
Wednesday morning. "We have an adults-only category and anybody who wants to go 
see (an NC-17-rated) film can go see it, period. It takes us back to the days, 
hopefully, of 'Midnight Cowboy,' 'Last Tango in Paris' and 'Clockwork Orange.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
You can quibble about the time it took Valenti to repair the system that he 
designed and installed 22 years ago. A lot of serious adult-themed films have 
been butchered because distributors couldn't book X-rated movies in theaters 
and because newspapers and television stations refused advertising for them. 
Ken Russell's "Crimes of Passion," Alan Parker's "Angel Heart" and William 
Friedkin's "Cruising" are just three that got caught up in public 
controversies; scores more were ignominiously edited down to Rs because their 
directors were contractually obligated to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Studios can still insist on R clauses in their contracts with filmmakers, but 
they can no longer use the excuse that they're necessary. The X, useful as a 
symbol for railroad crossings and Pussycat Theaters, is now about as relevant 
to the American film industry as the skull and crossbones it came to represent. 
</P>
<P>
There have been two changes in the ratings system since 1968. In 1984, a 
firestorm of protest over the violence in Steven Spielberg's PG-rated "Indiana 
Jones and the Temple of Doom" (you may recall a beating heart being ripped from 
a man's chest?) forced the MPAA to come up with the PG-13. The PG-13 was more a 
public-relations gesture than a necessity; it merely advised parents that PG-13 
films contained stronger content than those rated PG. The NC-17 does nothing 
less than remove a system of censorship from one of the world's most popular 
art forms. 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA made another adjustment in the ratings system Wednesday, and it's a 
good one. From now on, the Ratings Board will provide explanations for its 
decisions on films that are rated R and will provide those explanations to 
theater owners and to most of the nation's film critics. 
</P>
<P>
Critics should provide their readers and viewers with information about the 
content of films, and many do. They can now use the MPAA explanations, or 
provide their own, or use the MPAA judgments as departure points for debate. It 
will all be to the benefit of parents deciding which films are appropriate for 
their children and -- let's face it, adults use the ratings as much for their 
own choices as for their kids' -- the additional information will influence our 
viewing habits, too. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the changes announced Wednesday will continue to neutralize the 
passions of would-be community censors remains to be seen. Certainly, the ban 
on advertising for X-rated films will not apply to the NC-17 rating at major 
newspapers and television stations; The Times and the New York Times have both 
published editorials calling for ratings revisions. At the same time, it is 
inevitable that someone will submit a film for an NC-17 rating that contains 
scenes repugnant to most people and blue noses will begin to twitch and itch. 
</P>
<P>
But the rating system, restored to its original intent, is the right one in a 
free society. It is voluntary, it is easy to understand, and it does not place 
an arbitrary cap on how far films can go. As Valenti said Wednesday, if 
pornographers make a comeback in theaters (it's almost exclusively a video 
business now), why would they pay the MPAA to give it an NC-17 when the X tells 
all? 
</P>
<P>
Arguments will still arise over ratings given to specific films, and over the 
comparative content of films given the same ratings. Members of the Ratings 
Board still have to get a better sense of balance between the nature of 
violence and sexuality in films; critics have maintained, with plenty of 
evidence, that tougher standards are applied to sexuality than to mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
Those arguments, however frustrating to the participants, are healthy and 
unavoidable in dealing with something as subjective as popular taste. To have 
no ratings system at all would be a disaster; Hollywood would be editing 
different versions of films for counties, boroughs and parishes, and for the 
tastes of leaders of the religious, parent or government bodies that would 
breed -- as surely as mosquitoes in swamp water -- in each of them. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti made the right decision in rejecting the suggestion of some critics and 
directors that a new adults-only rating be inserted between the R and the X. 
His argument was that it would force the rating board members to decide when 
films were pornographic and when they were not, and he's right. Two adults-only 
ratings are not necessary anyway. If children can't get in, adults ought to be 
able to take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate future of the ratings system, perhaps on the verge of collapse 
just two days ago, is now in the hands of theater operators. The fact that they 
defaulted on their promise to enforce the R rating, which originally assured 
parents their under-17 kids couldn't get in without adult accompaniment, has 
done almost as much to cripple the system as the pornographers. 
</P>
<P>
Now they are being asked, and they have agreed, to enforce an adults-only 
rating. That means slowing traffic at the door long enough to check IDs when 
NC-17 films are being shown, and -- here's the hard part -- turning down 
admission money from those who are too young. The integrity of the system, and 
the newly regained freedom of filmmakers, may hang in the balance.

STRETCHING THE CONCEPT OF THE MEDICAL SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: PRODUCERS DOCTORED THE MEDICAL-DRAMA FORMAT TO CREATE A SHOW BASED 
ON THE PATIENT'S POINT OF VIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For a feat of entertainment, the new NBC anthology medical series "Lifestories" 
is probably the toughest sell in the modern television era. 
</P>
<P>
Who's going to watch a succession of dramas that includes a family confronting 
a member's alcoholism, a newscaster who tests HIV positive, a precise depiction 
of a man's first 47 minutes of a heart attack, aplastic anemia and bone-marrow 
transplants, cosmetic surgery, Alzheimer's disease, psychopathic personalities, 
gunshot trauma and near-death experiences? 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, about a man suffering colon cancer, was previewed in late August (to 
generally rave reviews) and repeats tonight at 11:30 in "The Tonight Show" hour 
as part of the network's "double-pump" promotion. Carson jumps ahead to 9:30 
for a 28th-anniversary show. 
</P>
<P>
Then "Lifestories" moves into its regular 8 p.m. slot on Sunday with a drama 
about a 40-year-old woman who, anxious to have a baby, undergoes in-vitro 
fertilization and then in-utero surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"This show may fail, but the audience has said, 'Don't be predictable, don't 
give us what we've had before, give us something that will make us stretch.' 
We'll test them with this one," observed Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of the NBC 
Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producers Don Ohlmeyer and Jeff Lewis, fingers crossed, think the 
show can succeed in grabbing and holding the audience, because the drama it 
offers is like no other: the grappling with real-life medical problems by 
characters who won't necessarily resolve them happily. 
</P>
<P>
"You could put Crockett and Tubbs (from 'Miami Vice') in a vat of boiling oil 
from now until the cows come home -- but the guy at home knows that somehow, 
unless they didn't sign their contract, that Crockett and Tubbs will be back 
next week!" Ohlmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis hopes "Lifestories" will build a reputation for strong emotion. "The 
fundamental reason people watch televised drama at all is because they want to 
be stirred up, they want their emotions engaged," he said. "If it's a cop show, 
those emotions get transformed into action, (a) sort of response to adrenalized 
stuff -- but if it's not an action show, then people want strong feelings." 
</P>
<P>
"Lifestories" came out of meetings between Ohlmeyer and Tartikoff on "reality" 
program ideas. Tartikoff, 41, who has beaten an encounter with Hodgkin's 
disease, suggested a medical show from the point of view of the patient -- 
"after 40 years of TV and radio shows from the doctor's point of view," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"My illness led to the conception of the idea," Tartikoff said, "but making it 
onto the NBC schedule had to do with what they (Ohlmeyer and Lewis) did with 
that idea. There are many autobiographical projects that from time to time I 
indulge myself in, and I would say that they don't have a greater percentage of 
getting on the air than those that come from Stephen Cannell's loins or Gary 
Goldberg's. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think audience interest is at an all-time high in terms of health and 
well-being. People are concerned about what we're doing to the environment and 
how that may in turn affect our health and what we eat." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Lewis, a cum laude (and class poet) from Yale who had taught writing 
at Harvard and went on to a law degree, figured he'd never do series television 
any more, after a grueling stint with "Hill Street Blues" and "Beverly Hills 
Buntz." 
</P>
<P>
"But my agent said I should meet Don, that 'he's not a bad guy'. . . . Then he 
wanted me to talk to Brandon and some of the guys at NBC." 
</P>
<P>
He came away with his mind changed. "They gave me virtually carte blanche to do 
anything I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that impressed both producers was a Tartikoff comment that he would 
like a show of such quality and sensitivity that doctors could refer patients 
to a given episode so that they would understand the scope of a particular 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," recalled Lewis, "this is an unusually altruistic and interesting 
thought that one simply doesn't hear in a pitch meeting for network shows." 
</P>
<P>
On a weekend in the Sierras, he began working out ideas. He remembered that the 
one play he acted in, "Our Town," used a friendly Stage Manager character to 
walk the audience through the travails of the community. That was the genesis 
of the narrator for "Lifestories" (performed by Robert Prosky), who can 
fast-forward the story by months or years, as well as explain medical 
procedures and get inside a patient's mind. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis believes the device imparts to the series a novelistic tenor. "It gives 
the viewers access to what the people are thinking and feeling," he said. "What 
a novelist can do is be intimate with the most inward parts. The stage offers 
communal interaction, but a novel works in and says what somebody's thinking." 
</P>
<P>
But if the unconventional format is a tough sell, the "Lifestories" time slot 
is even tougher. On Sundays at 8 p.m., it will face "America's Funniest Home 
Videos" and "America's Funniest People" on ABC, "Murder, She Wrote" on CBS, the 
raucous "In Living Color" and "Get a Life" on Fox and NFL football on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations, therefore, are low. Tartikoff shrugged. "We know it's going into 
the toughest time period, not only this season but maybe of all time. Well, 
it's a little easier now that 'The Simpsons' are not there. It's a time period 
where we haven't done well, so if they ('Lifestories') were to do a 15 share, 
that would be a 50% improvement over where we left off last May." 
</P>
<P>
Not that the master programmer doesn't have a trick or two up his sleeve, such 
as an episode that will deal with the physiology of love and sex. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll use this as a second 'booster rocket' for the show, maybe five or six 
weeks into the run," Tartikoff said. "We're not kidding ourselves about this 
time period . . . we would need to probably get it (the show) re-sampled and 
get the audience re-energized. So we plan to run this at 10 o'clock on a 
Tuesday or Wednesday night."

CRITIC AT LARGE: SCHLESINGER: AN ENGLISHMAN ABROAD; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: HIS LATEST PECULIARLY AMERICAN DRAMA IS 'PACIFIC HEIGHTS,' A 'YUPPIE 
NIGHTMARE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
John Schlesinger came out of documentary making and acting to direct a string 
of films, commencing with "A Kind of Loving," "Billy Liar" and "Darling," that 
rank high in the estimations of film history and stand as important witness to 
20th-Century life in England. His "Midnight Cowboy," from a terrific script by 
Waldo Salt, became the first, and thus far the only, X-rated film to win an 
Academy Award. In it, Schlesinger cast an unblinking eye on the downside of 
urban American life. 
</P>
<P>
In "Pacific Heights" (opening Friday), Schlesinger again casts an eye, still 
unblinking but rather more amused, on urban American life. It's a thriller, 
Schlesinger said the other afternoon, "a yuppie nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Keaton, Batman on a radically different flight, is an unpaying and 
sociopathic tenant out to destroy Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith's 
American dream, embodied in a San Francisco Victorian. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bold move for Michael to do it," Schlesinger says, "but when I saw 
him in 'Clean and Sober,' I realized what a really good actor he is. The trick 
here was to avoid going over the top. We tried going way over the top and way 
below the top, and I hope we found a middle road that works. His experience as 
a comedian has stood him well." 
</P>
<P>
The premise of the film was inspired by the actual experiences (slightly less 
melodramatic) scriptwriter Dan Pine and his wife had when they bought a house 
in San Francisco a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The nightmare," Schlesinger says, "will be familiar to anyone who aspires to 
have a house -- especially one they can't really afford to keep. My house in 
London stretched me beyond measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I was offered a documentary series. I was to be paid 50 pounds a week, not 
much even back then. But I didn't want to be tied up with a series. My father, 
who was a doctor and a very kind man, thought I was out of my mind. 'Look at 
all the wonderful people you'll meet,' he said, and I realized he was right. I 
also needed the money, such as it was. The series was 'The Valiant Years,' and 
I met Montgomery and all the others, although not Winston Churchill, who was 
too ill to participate. But I always thought of the fittings in my house as the 
Churchill curtains and cupboards." 
</P>
<P>
Good scripts are never in long supply, and Schlesinger has in recent years 
turned some of his attention to directing opera. He directed a well-remarked 
production of "Tales of Hoffmann" in 1980. At the urging of conductor Herbert 
von Karajan, Schlesinger mounted a production of "Un Ballo in Maschera" at 
Salzburg. The conductor died only a week before the initial performance. 
Schlesinger has now been asked to return to Salzburg to revive the production 
and direct it for television. 
</P>
<P>
With opera schedules requiring as much lead time as they do, Schlesinger 
already knows that in 1994 he will do his first production at the Metropolitan 
Opera, a 25th-anniversary performance by Placido Domingo in Verdi's "Otello," 
with James Levine conducting. 
</P>
<P>
Schlesinger had made films in 9.5mm as a child, graduating to 16 when he 
returned to Oxford after army service. One of his films earned a rave review 
from critic Dilys Powell. But after Oxford he could find no regular work as a 
filmmaker, and so spent eight years as an actor. That period included a tour of 
New Zealand with the British Commonwealth Theatre Company, which had been 
assembled by the well-known mystery writer Ngaio Marsh. The tour, intended to 
circle the Commonwealth, died in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually Schlesinger got back into documentaries, and one, about a Gypsy 
Italian opera company performing in east London, caught the eye of producer 
Joseph Yanni. It was for Yanni that Schlesinger did the remarkable string of 
features from "A Kind of Loving" through "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "Yanks." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers nostalgically and regretfully that "A Kind of Loving" had an 
11-week shooting schedule but only cost 180,000 pounds and earned back the cost 
in Britain alone. Such good, small, cheap films that still get made in England, 
"My Beautiful Laundrette," for example, tend to get fine reviews and small 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Schlesinger's hourlong television film, "An Englishman Abroad," about the 
English traitor Guy Burgess in exile in Moscow, became part of an evening of 
two one-act plays by Alan Bennett and Simon Callow. The other, about Sir 
Anthony Blunt, the curator of the Queen's Pictures, who proved to be himself a 
traitor, has now been scripted as a film, which Schlesinger may direct, and 
would love to. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the urging of his friends Vincent Price and Coral Brown, he will 
take a restorative cruise up the New England coast, having seen to the final 
prints and launching of his yuppie nightmare.

STARTING YOUR DAY THE CEREAL WAY

Until just a few years ago, a restaurant customer's request for cereal was 
answered with a bowl, a spoon, a glass of milk and a miniature box from 
Kellogg's. But power breakfasting has brought the day's humblest meal into the 
hands of chefs. They are helping us rediscover the satisfying flavor, texture 
and nutritional integrity of a bowl of oats. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of local restaurants reveals many favorite breakfast and brunch spots 
that offer a variety of whole-grain cereals, often made in the restaurant's own 
kitchen. Campanile, for example, serves a nutty granola made at the restaurant; 
Kate Mantilini offers Wheatena cooked in apple juice. Angeli Mare dishes up 
soft polenta with butter, brown sugar, raisins and pine nuts, and Babalu 
features Irish oatmeal with Grape Nuts and fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Neolithic Age, cooks have experimented with grain -- indeed the 
greatest civilizations have been built and destroyed over the stuff. But I 
started experimenting with cereal in reaction to trips to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
A walk down the supermarket cereal aisle reveals an overwhelming selection of 
flakes, crisps and "O"s. Just past the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cereal and 
Breakfast With Barbie is a fleet of healthy-looking cereal boxes with names 
such as Nutrigrain, Fruitful Bran and Kenmei Rice Bran. I am sure that many of 
these cereals are good for you; however, I prefer to know exactly what is and 
isn't going into my cereal bowl. That's why I make most of my breakfast 
cereals. 
</P>
<P>
We're so accustomed to brightly colored boxes of mass-produced flakes that we 
forget how simple cereals are to make at home. All it takes is a big bowl for 
mixing, an oven for toasting and a few storage containers. The ingredients are 
inexpensive and easily obtainable. Most are available in supermarkets, and a 
trip to the health food store should fill any gaps. 
</P>
<P>
Whole grains are satisfying to eat on their own. You can develop a great 
appreciation for each one by eating simple porridges made from just a single 
grain and water. Multi-grain cereals add depth, complexity and texture. All 
grains have a more intense, nuttier flavor when toasted. Try toasting them in a 
200-degree oven until golden. The subsequent cooking procedure is easy, and 
always the same: 1) Bring liquid to a boil. 2) Add grain. 3) Simmer partially 
covered until done. 
</P>
<P>
The trick to making good multi-grain mixes for hot cereals is in combining 
grains with similar cooking times. Oatmeal, bulgur, rye flakes, cornmeal and 
bran all take less than 20 minutes to cook, whereas 35 to 45 minutes are 
required for cooking brown rice, millet and pearled barley. More than an hour 
is needed for wheat berries. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the basic ingredients you will need to make your own cereals. You 
should note that the same grain may vary slightly in size and thickness from 
brand to brand, so the recommended cooking times are only approximate. 
</P>
<P>
* OATS: Always buy old-fashioned or steel-cut oats. Quick-cooking and instant 
oats are cut much thinner than the coarser old-fashioned ones, so their texture 
doesn't hold up well in homemade cereals. Steel-cut oats, also known as Scotch 
or Irish oatmeal, are cut into fine bits. Unlike instant oats, their pronounced 
oat flavor and creamy texture improves with cooking. They can be purchased in 
supermarkets or health food stores. Cooking time: regular oats, approximately 
10 minutes; steel-cut oats, 15 minutes or longer. 
</P>
<P>
* WHEAT: Wheat berries, which are hulled wheat kernels, are delicious but take 
several hours to cook. Wheat flakes are a quicker, more convenient alternative 
to berries. These are not like "bran flakes"; they are uncooked flakes cut from 
the wheat berry and are great to use in multi-grain cereals. Wheat that is 
cooked and dried before grinding is called bulgur, commonly used in Middle 
Eastern cuisine. Because of its wonderful nutty flavor and short cooking time, 
it is an excellent grain for breakfast cereal. Bulgur is very tasty simply 
simmered in water with a little butter, cinnamon and nutmeg. Wheat germ, when 
toasted, is a crunchy addition to cereal, and wheat bran provides valuable 
fiber. Wheat germ and wheat bran can be purchased in supermarkets; wheat 
berries, wheat flakes and bulgur can be found in health food stores. Cooking 
times: wheat berries, 1 to 3 hours; wheat flakes, 12 minutes; bulgur, 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
* RYE: Rye is not an important commercial crop in the United States, but is 
fundamental to many European cuisines. It has an earthy flavor that contributes 
to a good multi-grain cereal. Available in flakes at health food stores. 
Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
* BARLEY: A lot of people associate the rich flavor of barley with mushroom 
barley soup, not breakfast cereal. It's available in whole kernels, pearl 
barley and barley flakes at health foods stores. Cooking time: whole kernel 
barley, 1 hour and 15 minutes; pearled barley, 30 minutes; barley flakes, 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
* TRITICALE: Pronounced trit-i-kay-lee, this high-protein cereal grain is a 
man-made cross between wheat and rye. Available in flakes at health food 
stores. Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
* CORN: Yellow cornmeal is a quick-cooking, flavorful grain. Mix it with other 
grains, or eat it alone with milk, a little sugar and fresh berries. When 
making cornmeal mush or polenta, always pour the cornmeal into boiling water 
gradually and steadily while whisking vigorously, to avoid lumping. Available 
in supermarkets and in health food stores. Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
* MILLET: A staple of Asia and Africa, millet is relatively unknown in this 
country. It is a delicate grain with a nutty flavor. Available in health food 
stores. Cooking time: 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
* RICE: We don't often think of rice as a breakfast food, but many other 
countries do. The flavor of white rice pales in comparison to unpolished brown 
rice, which has a texture that holds up well in hot cereals. Available in 
supermarkets and health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
* NUTS, SEEDS AND DRIED FRUITS: Unsalted nuts and seeds add a crunchy texture 
to cereals, hot or cold. For more flavor, try toasting nuts in a 200-degree 
oven. Walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios, cashews, sunflower seeds, 
pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, raisins, currants, dried apricots, 
dates, apples, unsweetened coconut flakes and figs are all good to add to your 
cereal mix. Available at supermarkets and health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
* FRESH FRUIT: Just about any kind of fresh fruit blends well with cereal. Some 
of the best are berries, bananas, peaches, apples and pears. Try cooking 
cereals with part apple juice or stirring in apple sauce or pureed pears; add 
berries just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Muesli was the invention of a famous Swiss doctor who successfully treated 
children with rickets by feeding them this cold cereal three times a day. It is 
traditionally eaten raw after an overnight soak in water or milk. I like the 
cereal's texture when mixed with milk right at the breakfast table. This is my 
favorite version. 
</P>
<P>
MUESLI 
</P>
<P>
7 cups old-fashioned or steel-cut rolled oats (not instant) 
</P>
<P>
1 cup toasted wheat germ 
</P>
<P>
1 cup toasted wheat bran 
</P>
<P>
1 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
1 cup chopped pitted dates 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sliced almonds 
</P>
<P>
Combine oats, wheat germ, wheat bran, raisins, dates and almonds in bowl. Mix 
well and store in airtight container. Serve with milk. Makes about 12 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: Add fresh fruit just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
Replace milk with yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in honey just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
In place of almonds, use walnuts, pecans or hazelnuts, or a combination of 
these. 
</P>
<P>
Soak cereal in orange or apple juice overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't really a pudding, but the primary elements of this old-fashioned 
dessert make a great hot breakfast cereal with less of the characteristic 
richness. If you cook the rice the night before, cool it, cover with a moist 
paper towel and refrigerate -- the dish is quick to put together in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
BROWN RICE "PUDDING" 
</P>
<P>
1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine

1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
Combine milk, butter, vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar in medium saucepan. 
Bring to boil. Add rice and raisins, breaking apart with wooden spoon. Return 
to boil. Reduce heat to low. Stir in orange zest. Cover and simmer until most 
of liquid is absorbed, about 5 to 7 minutes. Serve immediately. Makes 4 to 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
HOMEMADE MULTI-GRAIN CEREAL 
</P>
<P>
2 cups oats 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup rye flakes 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup barley flakes 
</P>
<P>
1 cup wheat flakes 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup wheat bran 
</P>

1/4 cup cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
1/8 cup flax seeds 
</P>
<P>
Combine oats, rye, barley and wheat flakes, wheat bran, cornmeal and flax seeds 
in bowl. Mix well. Cover and store in airtight container. Makes about 4 1/2 
cups, about 20 (1/2-cup) servings of cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To cook for 1 serving, use 1 cup water for every 1/4 cup uncooked cereal. 
Bring water to boil, add cereal and simmer, partially covered, about 12 to 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: Cook cereal in mixture of half water, half apple juice. 
</P>
<P>
Stir 3 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce or 1/2 banana, mashed, into each 
portion of cooked cereal. 
</P>
<P>
Stir 1 teaspoon each of maple syrup and butter into each cooked portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Homemade granola is simple to make and costs about one-third the price of 
store-bought. Vary the mix by changing the grains, using more or fewer nuts, 
trying different dried fruits and increasing or decreasing the honey. This 
recipe makes a fairly flaky granola; if you prefer a chunkier granola, increase 
the quantity of oil. 
</P>
<P>
HOMEMADE GRANOLA 
</P>
<P>
1 cup wheat flakes 
</P>
<P>
1 cup triticale flakes 
</P>
<P>
2 cups rolled oats 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup wheat germ 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sunflower seeds 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sesame seeds 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cashews, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>

<P>
3 tablespoons water, about 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped 
</P>
<P>
Combine wheat and triticale flakes, oats, wheat germ, sunflower seeds, sesame 
seeds, cashews and coconut flakes in large bowl. Drizzle honey and water over 
cereal, then toss until grains are evenly coated. Add more water if grains 
aren't sticking together. 
</P>
<P>
Spread in even layer on baking sheet or in roasting pan. Bake at 275 degrees 
about 50 minutes or until golden brown, stirring every 15 minutes. Remove from 
oven and stir in apricots. (Granola will be sticky, but will harden as it 
cools.) Cool completely. Store in airtight container. Makes about 8 cups.

When it comes to fast-food preparations, no option is easier than an omelet. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are obvious: Most people keep eggs on hand, so there's no need for 
last-minute shopping. And once you've got the eggs, there is no limit to the 
range of ingredients that can be tossed in with them to make an omelet. Omelets 
have other attributes. They are inexpensive. They are appropriate at any hour 
of the day or night; they cook in about three minutes. And, with a little 
practice, they are incredibly easy to make. 
</P>
<P>
What goes into the omelet is limited only by the imagination and inventiveness 
of the cook. Simple combinations -- such as a handful of fresh herbs or 
leftover potatoes -- create peasant omelets. Mix those potatoes with Swiss 
cheese and you have an omelette savoyarde. Saute some onions, add a little red 
wine vinegar and butter and you've got an omelette Lyonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
Scraps of smoked salmon mixed with sour cream and sliced green onions make an 
elegant omelet. Leftover pasta with sauce or sandwich fillings, such as chicken 
or tuna in mayonnaise, make surprisingly tasty additions to the basic omelet. 
Leftover fresh vegetables make such wonderful omelets that it's worth cooking 
extras with dinner so you can turn them into an omelet the next day. 
</P>
<P>
My basic omelet recipe uses one whole egg and three egg whites, which makes the 
omelet lower in cholesterol than the whole-egg version. It looks like the real 
thing, but the taste and texture are lighter than its classic counterpart. For 
those who require cholesterol-free foods, the all-egg-white omelet is a 
delicious answer. And when you're feeling really reckless, the go-for-it 
country omelet is completely satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to successful omelet rolling is simple. All it requires is some 
practice. For batterie de cuisine, you'll need: one mixing bowl, one whisk, one 
dinner fork, one firm plastic spatula, one plate and one omelet pan, preferably 
non-stick and 7 inches across the flat bottom, with shallow sloping sides and a 
long handle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BASIC OMELET 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
3 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon water 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Heat butter in 7-inch non-stick omelet pan over medium high heat. Place egg and 
egg whites in mixing bowl with water, salt and pepper. Whisk until smooth, 
without any egg white lumps. 
</P>
<P>
When butter is sizzling hot but not browned, add eggs. Keep heat at medium 
high. Shake pan back and forth, holding it flat on burner. 
</P>
<P>
Once bottom layer of omelet is set, simultaneously stir surface of eggs rapidly 
with fork without disturbing cooked bottom, accomplished by holding fork tines 
parallel with bottom of pan. Keep eggs in motion in this manner until almost 
set, about 1 minute. Then add filling, if any, on omelet half nearest pan 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
Cover pan to fully cook eggs through, about 1 more minute. Uncover pan and 
grasp handle firmly with hand turned palm up. Tilt pan up and insert firm 
spatula under omelet nearest handle and roll onto heated plate. Omelet can be 
held in 200-degree oven several minutes while other omelets are cooked. Makes 1 
serving. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a most refreshing omelet option, working well for breakfast, brunch, 
lunch or even as dessert after a very simple, light meal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRESH STRAWBERRY OMELET 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pint strawberries, hulled 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons sugar (use more if berries are tart) 
</P>
<P>
Grated zest of 1/4 orange 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon orange juice 
</P>
<P>
2 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
6 large egg whites 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
Additional strawberries for garnish 
</P>
<P>
Quarter half of strawberries (or cut into eighths, if large). Toss with 1 
tablespoon sugar, orange zest and juice in small bowl. Puree remaining 1/4 pint 
strawberries with 1 tablespoon sugar in food processor or blender. 
</P>
<P>
Whisk eggs, egg whites, water and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in mixing bowl 
until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Heat 1 tablespoon butter in 7-inch non-stick omelet pan over medium high heat 
until sizzling hot but not browned. Add half of egg mixture. Shake pan back and 
forth on burner. Once bottom of omelet is cooked, use fork to simultaneously 
stir uncooked surface of omelet without scraping bottom of pan. 
</P>
<P>
When eggs are almost set, about 1 minute, use slotted spoon to arrange half of 
cut strawberries (reserve juices) on omelet nearest to pan handle. Cover pan 
and cook eggs until fully set, about 1 more minute. Uncover pan, grasp handle 
firmly with hand turned palm up. Tilt pan up and insert firm spatula under 
omelet nearest handle and roll onto heated plate. Keep warm in 200-degree oven. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat steps with remaining omelet. Combine reserved strawberry juices with 
pureed sauce. Spoon sauce over omelets, dividing evenly. Garnish with 
strawberries. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 A well-seasoned puree mixed only with beaten egg whites is a delicious option 
for those on cholesterol-free diets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPINACH-AND-GARLIC NO-CHOLESTEROL OMELET 
</P>
<P>
1/2 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed completely 
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons light-tasting olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 large clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 large shallot, minced 
</P>
<P>
4 large egg whites 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup prepared marinara sauce, heated, optional 
</P>
<P>
Squeeze spinach dry in cloth towel (measures 1/3 cup). 
</P>
<P>
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in 7-inch non-stick omelet pan over medium-high heat. 
Add garlic and shallot and heat through, about 30 seconds. Add spinach and heat 
through, about 1 minute. Transfer to blender or food processor. Add 1 egg white 
and mix until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Using mixer, beat remaining 3 egg whites with salt until they hold shape but 
are still glossy. Fold in spinach mixture and season to taste with pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Heat remaining olive oil in pan until sizzling. Transfer omelet mixture to pan, 
spreading evenly with spatula. Cover and cook until well set, about 3 minutes. 
Uncover pan, grasp handle firmly with hand turned palm up. Tilt pan up and 
insert firm spatula under omelet nearest handle and roll onto heated plate. 
Serve immediately with marinara sauce, if desired. Makes 1 serving. 
</P>
<P>
 This traditional omelet has everything going for it, making the splurge well 
worth it. It's a recipe that can be easily doubled or tripled.

SOMETHING TO CLUCK OVER; 
</P>
<P>
CHICKEN RANCH: HAPPY HENS THAT ARE NOT CONSTANTLY COOPED UP ARE PRODUCING THE 
GOLDEN EGG FOR NEST EGGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It made sense to Robert Brown when he first thought six years ago that a 
happier chicken would lay a tastier egg. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, it costs more to keep a chicken happy than it does to just keep 
it. So Brown had to figure out how a farmer could keep those hens happy and 
still make a profit on the process. 
</P>
<P>
His answer was a marketing concept called Nest Eggs -- eggs laid by free-range 
chickens fed a chemical-free diet and marketed as an extra-cost, ecologically 
sound, better-tasting alternative to traditional eggs. 
</P>
<P>
The eggs are produced under contract with Brown's Food Animal Concerns Trust. 
All are laid by hens that have free run of their barn or barnyard, and none get 
chemicals or pesticides in their feed. 
</P>
<P>
"The result is better eggs with plump yolks, firm whites that aren't runny and 
thick shells," Brown said. "Eggs produced this way also taste better." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Brown said, "nearly all the eggs available in supermarkets are 
produced by huge factory operations where the hens are caged, confined to 
extremely small spaces and often drugged." 
</P>
<P>
Those conditions, he said, produce stress and predispose the hens to diseases. 
As a result, some producers routinely put antibiotics and other drugs in their 
chicken feed. Others add insecticide to prevent flies from breeding in the 
chicken droppings under the cages. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he hatched the Nest Eggs scheme in 1984 "because we knew typical egg 
factories are very hard on the hens and because we wanted to demonstrate that 
farmers could make a healthy profit producing eggs according to FACT's humane 
standards," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The price of humane treatment, however, is more than chicken feed. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Wubbena, who produces eggs for Nest Eggs at his farm near Forreston, Ill., 
says his free-range chickens take three times the barn space they would if they 
were caged. They also get a special diet made up mostly of farm-ground whole 
soybeans and corn, a feed that costs substantially more than a normal fowl 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like we say, 'You are what you eat,' an egg is what the chicken eats," 
Wubbena said. "The result is in the taste. My eggs taste better." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers obviously are willing to shell out extra cash, whether for 
animal-rights concerns or simply for the promise of better taste. Despite the 
fact Nest Eggs cost at least $1 per dozen more than regular eggs, sales have 
been booming. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 700,000 dozen Nest Eggs were produced and sold, compared 
to 94,000 dozen as recently as 1987. Brown says about 5.75 billion eggs of all 
types are produced annually in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 hens lay eggs for FACT at six approved farms -- four in 
Pennsylvania, one in Maine and Wubbena's in Northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Each farmer has a different arrangement with Nest Eggs, but each receives a 
premium price for the product, Brown said. The average is about 20 cents gross 
profit to the farmer on each dozen eggs sold to FACT, compared with 7 cents or 
8 cents per dozen for eggs sent to market through other distribution channels. 
</P>
<P>
The brand currently is available at some stores in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, 
Maine, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
FACT also produces free-range veal at its farm in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
"FACT is primarily concerned about inhumane factory-farming methods, many of 
which can contaminate the food supply with drug residues or can lead to human 
health problems such as food-borne diseases," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike other organizations addressing food safety issues, FACT puts its 
farming ideas into practice, acquires direct farming experience and 
demonstrates that humane production of safe foods can provide money-making 
opportunities for family-owned farms."

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: SEARCHING FOR THE HOLE TRUTH

<P>
Almost everybody eats doughnuts every once in a while, and a lot of people more 
often than that. I'll eat a doughnut about twice a month to cut the burn of 
super-caffeinated doughnut coffee, the kind that snaps your eyeballs to the 
back of your head. To me, a doughnut is the equivalent of the filter on a 
cigarette. (The difference between a doughnut and a donut is the ugh.) 
</P>
<P>
To others, doughnuts are a way of life: there are four doughnut shops within a 
block of my apartment; an estimated 2,500 in Southern California. One figure I 
ran across, from '86, said that 42% of Winchell's customers buy Winchell's 
doughnuts more than four times a week. No respectable Teamster would eat 
anything else on a film set. 
</P>
<P>
But why? 
</P>
<P>
A doughnut Diogenes, searching for an honest cruller, I went out to La Puente 
the other day and took a drive down Donut Lane; picked up a dozen donuts and 
three containers of milk. Donut Lane is the way through the Donut Hole, a 
splendid drive-through doughnut shop anchored by a giant hemi-doughnut at 
either end, a 1947 architectural triumph. (From a couple of blocks away, the 
place looked like the chocolate-brown coils of a sea serpent wriggling its way 
toward Hacienda Heights.) The doughnut display was spotless, a living doughnut 
museum that included Tiger Tail Twists and baroquely frosted French crullers. 
The milk was icy cold. But the doughnuts were just OK. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, a friend and I drove to Stan's Corner Donut Shoppe in 
Westwood Village, and found a parking space right in front. We ordered one of 
everything, basically. I thought we'd take most of them home, but Margaret got 
really excited and took a single bite out of every doughnut right there in the 
shop, which was pretty compulsive but also kind of cool. Stan's makes what you 
could call boutique doughnuts, custom types that seem made with a pastry shop 
in mind, doughnutized versions of pastries and muffins and pies. Margaret 
thought peanut-butter chocolate-chip was extremely overrated, but we both liked 
the blueberry buttermilk doughnut a lot. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped by Randy's Donuts, which sells mediocre old-fashioneds under that 
40-foot raised-glazed you see on the way to the airport, and by Johnny 'O,' 
where the doughnuts are average and the apple fritters are renowned. (Back at 
the office, a colleague took a bite of a fritter and proclaimed it the most 
disgusting thing she'd ever tasted. It wasn't that bad.) We went to some other 
places, and some doughnut chains you don't want to hear about. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret didn't eat another doughnut, and in fact would became queasy when I'd 
so much as whisper the words "maple bar." 
</P>
<P>
I brought a few sacks of doughnuts to a pastry chef I know, and watched as she 
prodded them and sniffed them and cut them in half with a knife. She popped a 
bit of devil's food doughnut into her mouth and wrinkled her nose. She compared 
the chocolate icing to melted phonograph records. She turned a raised-glazed 
doughnut onto its belly and pinched a wad from its unglazed bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"Taste this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The piece of doughnut was soft, bready, unpleasantly doughy, flavorless except 
for the soapy taste of fat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an underdone heat 'n' serve dinner roll, right?" she said. "I don't 
know why anybody would want to eat something like that. It's not really . . . a 
doughnut." 
</P>
<P>
She picked up a plain cake doughnut from the table and popped a piece in her 
mouth. The doughnut, from Bob's Coffee &amp; Donut in Farmer's Market was good 
if not exceptional, a fine, basic doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more like it," she said: "crisp on the outside, not too oily, not too 
much like bread. When you're dealing with an ordinary doughnut shop, the baking 
powder (cake) doughnuts beat the yeast-raised doughnuts every time." 
</P>

Doughnut wisdom for the ages.

<P>
The Food section's Newsbites column (Sept. 6) contained a short article about 
rats who died of respiratory failure after ingesting large quantities of hot 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The article was light in tone and admonished readers not to drink quarts of hot 
sauce or "shoot up" with hot sauce lest they suffer a similar fate. Can you 
imagine, however, the suffering involved in this reported experiment? Obviously 
the rats didn't rush to overindulge a hot-sauce passion -- they must have been 
force-fed. A death by respiratory failure, for man, rat, dog, horse, etc. is a 
horrible one. SARI REZNICK, San Diego

Mahaffey features his liquid morning starter in a "health" menu consisting of a 
smoked salmon omelet made with egg whites (eliminates the cholesterol and fat 
in the eggs), a bowl of grain-rich granola, or, for those who prefer something 
more substantive, corn crepes with Sonoma ham and grilled tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of health-conscious hotel guests we have to keep happy," said 
Mahaffey. 
</P>

BACK TO BASICS: HOMEMADE TWIST ON PRETZELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pretzels date back to the Middle Ages, according to "Women's Day Encyclopedia" 
(Fawcett Publications, 1966). Supposedly they were first baked by an Italian 
monk as a reward for children learning their prayers. 
</P>
<P>
Their popularity spread through Central Europe. Even today, a gilt pretzel 
hanging over a door in Switzerland or Germany designates the establishment as a 
baker's shop. Soft pretzels have the oldest history; however, the crisp variety 
was being produced commercially by a bakery in Lititz, Pa., in 1861. The 
following recipe is for this latter type, but if a lighter texture is desired, 
allow the formed pretzels to rise about 20 minutes before baking. 
</P>
<P>
Pretzels are prepared from a simple yeast dough, kneaded until it is smooth and 
elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease the top and let 
rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Punch the dough down and divide into 16 equal portions. Roll each between the 
palms of your hands into a rope about 16 inches long (Step 1). 
</P>
<P>
To form the pretzels, cross the ends of the rope, forming a circle (Step 2). 
Twist the ends once again (Step 3), then pull up and over to meet the top edge 
of the circle (Step 4). 
</P>
<P>
Place the shaped pretzels on a foil-lined baking sheet, brush with beaten egg 
(Step 5) and sprinkle with coarse salt (Step 6) before baking. 
</P>
<P>
Pretzels are a traditional food of Oktoberfest celebrations in Germany and 
throughout the rest of the world. The homemade variety are best served still 
warm from the oven, accompanied by mustard and beer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOMEMADE PRETZELS 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups warm (105 to 115 degrees) water 
</P>
<P>
1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
4 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, beaten 
</P>
<P>
Coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
Pour water into large mixing bowl. Sprinkle yeast and sugar over surface. Stir 
until dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
Mix in flour. Form into ball. Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead 
until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Place dough in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in warm 
place free from drafts until doubled, about 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Punch dough down. Divide into 16 equal portions, about 2-ounces each. Form 
pretzels. Place about 2 inches apart on greased, foil-lined baking sheets. 
Brush with beaten eggs and sprinkle with coarse salt. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 475 degrees 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking 
sheets and cool on wire racks. Makes 16 pretzels.

ABOUT WINE: THE RUSSIAN RIVER: PINOT NOIR SUPERSTAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wine is made by people -- who leave their imprint on the wines. But wine is 
less a product of people than of place, and one of those places -- with a 
personality all its own -- is out here in the rolling hills of western Sonoma 
County. 
</P>
<P>
There are 11 appellations -- defined growing regions -- in Sonoma County. But 
unlike some of the others, Russian River is limited in what it can grow well. 
The western half of Russian River is even more limited. 
</P>
<P>
But what grows well here produces some of the greatest wines in California, 
perhaps the world. Why has the region's reputation as a great wine-growing 
region been so late to develop? 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons is that this area northwest of Santa Rosa is not easy to 
locate. The roads wind about in a fashion reminiscent of pickup sticks; 
wineries are located not on main arteries but on tiny veins that often are 
dead-ends. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the region makes wines that are often awkward waifs when they are young; 
time in the bottle improves them. They take introspection to understand. 
</P>
<P>
Pinot Noir is the variety that does best here. Chardonnay, Zinfandel, 
Gewurztraminer, Semillon and Petite Sirah are also good, but Cabernet Sauvignon 
and Sauvignon Blanc struggle a bit. (Some marvelously complex Cabernets can be 
made here, though they require bottle age to tame their hardness.) 
</P>
<P>
Pinot Noir, though, grows slowly, ripening later than in other areas. Cool 
nights help offset any hot days that arrive around harvest time, allowing Pinot 
Noir to retain its natural fruitiness and acidity. 
</P>
<P>
The best Pinot Noirs here (and there are no mediocre ones) are from Joseph 
Swan, J. Rochioli, Davis Bynum, Williams and Selyem, Laurier, Dehlinger, Mark 
West, Iron Horse and De Loach. But in the last five years, the best I have 
tasted are the Pinot Noirs of Gary Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the release of his 1988 Pinot Noir from grapes off the Howard Allen 
ranch, Farrell has hit the pinnacle. This limited and expensive wine ($25 a 
bottle) is a wine of incredible depth -- one of those rare treats worth the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Its aroma is deep and spicy, but it is more graceful than many darker-styled 
wines. The flavors are rich with cherry and spice elements that explode flavor 
on the tongue. (Farrell's Sonoma County bottling, $15, is also superb, but the 
Allen wine is the killer.) 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Northern California had unusual growing conditions. A May rain hit 
just at flowering time, reducing the size of the crop. Farrell said that 
although there was less juice per acre of fruit, the wine was more concentrated 
and flavored. 
</P>
<P>
In many areas of the world, the amount of sugar determines when the grapes are 
harvested. Farrell said in the Russian River, picking by sugar level is not 
always a true indicator of ripeness. With Pinot Noir especially, it is the 
taste of the grapes -- and their appearance -- that are the true indicators of 
flavor development. 
</P>
<P>
"Rochioli can walk into his vineyard and look at the grapes and taste them and 
tell you just when to pick," said Farrell, "and the grapes will have the 
perfect acid and pH." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Berglund at Joseph Swan, located east of where Farrell gets his fruit, 
notes that making Pinot Noir is another conundrum. He said modern methods that 
emphasize crushing the fruit, filtering and pumping simply don't work. The 
grape rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to screw up even the best grapes," said Berglund. "But the people 
who have had the guts to make Pinot Noir out here are refugees from the 1960s, 
adventuresome people, artists who never had the technology. So they had to make 
the wines more simply. Which makes better wine." 
</P>
<P>
Handling the Pinot Noir fruit more gently, he said, makes more delicate, 
flavorful wine. Thus many wine makers are now eliminating the crushing of the 
fruit, preferring instead to simply tread on the whole clusters (sometimes bare 
feet replace boots). 
</P>
<P>
"Tom (Dehlinger) was a professional before he opened his winery and he was 
meticulous, so he made wine with more consistency than some of the others right 
from the start," said Berglund. 
</P>
<P>
Dehlinger's wines are made in the southern Russian River area, where it's just 
a trace warmer than in some of the cooler pockets. They have more fruit 
extract, but also a bit more astringency. Dehlinger now is experimenting with 
growing and vinification techniques that will make a slightly more delicate 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
Across the road, to the west and a mile north, lie Iron Horse's Pinot Noir 
vines, in the cooler Green Valley. Iron Horse makes a lighter yet still 
substantial Pinot Noir, one that ages beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles further north, Laurier produces another delicately styled wine, one 
often more pink than red, but with great flavor. Back east, toward Santa Rosa, 
Mark West's Pinot Noir is scented with cloves; De Loach accents cinnamon and 
rose petal. 
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest Pinot Noirs of the region in the last few years has been 
from Williams and Selyem, lighter-styled wines that are spicy with cinnamon, 
clove and cherry. Bynum's Pinot Noirs (made since 1978 by Farrell) are similar 
to his own wines, but with an intriguing earthiness; Rochioli's wines are 
loaded with cherry flavors and tend toward the lighter style. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell's Howard Allen wine is limited; just 300 cases were made and demand is 
high. Dehlinger's newly released 1988 Pinot Noir ($16.50) has intense clove and 
cherry flavors in a harder package. Swan's 1987 ($20) is more compact, dense, 
but with a grace not seen in Swan wines of the past. Williams and Selyem's 
"Russian River" ($20) is nearly as intense as any, with a sweet-oak character. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 J. Rochioli ($18) likewise has a violet-and-spice fruit and is 
graceful. Iron Horse's 1987 ($18), darker than in the early years, is still not 
as brooding as the Swan and Dehlinger, offering a bit more elegance. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the high prices for these wines has to do with supply. None of 
them are widely available. Farrell says: "Russian River hasn't gotten the 
publicity of some other areas, but that's OK. Actually, we're trying to keep 
this thing quiet because of the limited acreage out here." 
</P>
<P>
There are probably fewer than 500 acres of top-quality Pinot Noir vineyard land 
here, and Farrell paid $1,500 per ton for the Rochioli grapes last year, a lot 
more than many growers paid for Cabernet and Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he used some of the most expensive barrels in the world ($625 each) 
for aging the wines, because he liked the flavors they imparted. 
</P>
<P>
Another day I will explore the other excellent wines of the Russian River area, 
but with the release of the exciting 1988 Pinot Noirs from this region 
imminent, the Burgundian red variety owns the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
1988 Meridian Pinot Noir ($14) -- Other regions of California besides the 
Russian River region produce exceptional Pinot Noir, and this Santa Barbara 
County wine is a lovely example of a racy style of the wine, with loads of 
berrylike fruit. The wine is in somewhat limited supply (just 1,800 cases), but 
it's worth seeking out. The winery has scheduled a November 1 release date.

KID STUFF: SHIFTING SANDS; 
</P>
<P>
CORONA DEL MAR COMPETITION PUTS CASTLE SCULPTING IN THE HANDS OF ARCHITECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The august members of the Orange County chapter of the American Institute of 
Architects are out to boost their image. And if it takes crawling around in the 
sand to do it, well, all the better. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Sept. 30, local architects, landscape architects and affiliated 
professionals will scoop, shape and otherwise manipulate the sands of Corona 
del Mar State Beach in the second annual AIA/Orange County Invitational 
Sandcastle Competition. Spectators can watch the pros at work from 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m., then cast their ballots for their favorite entry. An awards ceremony will 
follow at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five teams are scheduled to compete, according to event spokeswoman 
Loralyn Reif, who called the contest "the last, and hopefully the best, of the 
three major sandcastle competitions" in the county. (The United Way and Newport 
Seafest sponsored large contests earlier this month.) 
</P>
<P>
"These are professionals in design creating absolutely spectacular sand 
sculptures and castles," Reif said. "The end results are amazing; it almost 
becomes a mini-Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main goals of the chapter is to increase architectural awareness in 
Orange County, and we feel this event is a fun way to do just that," she 
continued, adding that more than 2,000 spectators attended last year's event. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors will be working in two major categories, sand sculptures and 
sandcastles, said Reif, who expects this year's entries to be evenly split 
between the two. 
</P>
<P>
"Sand sculptures tend to be more free form," she explained, "ranging anywhere 
from an alligator to a palm tree. For example, last year's grand prize winner, 
Joseph Woollett &amp; Associates, interpreted classical Greek ruins. Another 
team created this big foot about to step on a figure of a man, and called it 
'Under Pressure.' " A sandcastle takes a more traditional form and is generally 
outfitted with moats, turrets and drawbridges, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of judges, including Tony DeLap, a sculptor and UCI instructor; Cathy 
Curtis, a Times staff writer who covers art for the Orange County edition, and 
David Smith of Newport's World Famous Architects, will award three prizes in 
each division, as well as an overall Grand Prize. Judges will focus on 
originality of design, best use of site, degree of difficulty and detail, and 
execution. Onlookers can cast their ballots for a special People's Choice 
award. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions won't be easy. When they're not shaping office towers and elegant 
homes, many of these professionals work as master sand sculptors, competing in 
sandcastle contests around the globe, including the prestigious U.S. Open 
Sandcastle Competition, held for the past 12 years at Imperial Beach in San 
Diego. Typical of these are the husband-and-wife team of Gregory and Leslie 
Lebon, who recently created a 35-foot-high "city of the future," complete with 
eight-foot bridges and a walk-through viewer's path, for the Sand Craft 
Festival in Kamaishi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"To the architects, it's a matter of pride" in their craft, said Reiff. "But 
sand sculpting is one of those things that can start out as a hobby, and before 
you know it, you're addicted to it."

DANCE; 
</P>
<P>
FLOWERING IN THE POST-BALANCHINE ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN REITER, Susan Reiter is a free-lance writer who lives in New York and 
is a frequent Calendar contributor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Margaret Tracey and Ben Huys are part of the new generation of New York City 
Ballet dancers who never knew company founder and choreographer George 
Balanchine in any personal way and are now entrusted with his ballets. 
</P>
<P>
But despite lacking the benefits of a personal connection with the seminal 
choreographer, these two talents have flowered in recent seasons, as each took 
on demanding assignments with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey and Huys, both 23, come to Orange County as soloists who have 
accumulated a considerable repertory of important roles. While a one-week 
season (performances continue through Sunday, Sept. 30) can give only a 
sampling, each has some plum assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey danced Balanchine's "Tarantella" on opening night and will perform the 
featured role that Peter Martins created for her in his most recent ballet, 
"Fearful Symmetries," on Friday, Sept. 28, and Saturday, Sept. 29, at the 
Performing Arts Center. Huys was in the First Theme of Balanchine's "The Four 
Temperaments" on opening night and will be seen as the Man in Green in Jerome 
Robbins' "Dances at a Gathering" on Thursday, Sept. 27, and at the matinee on 
Saturday, Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
During breaks between recent rehearsals at the New York State Theater, Tracey 
and Huys each took time to look back on the route that led them to NYCB. 
</P>
<P>
Both had to travel a considerable distance -- albeit in opposite directions -- 
to get to New York, and overcome initial discomfort at finding themselves alone 
in the city at a very young age. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey, one of four children of a talented family in Pueblo, Colo. (her younger 
sister, Kathleen, is also in the company), came to the NYCB-affiliated School 
of American Ballet at 15 after auditioning in Colorado, and studied there for 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dying to get out of Pueblo," recalled Tracey, who received the bulk of 
her early training from her mother. "I knew that if I wanted to be a 
professional, Colorado had nothing to offer me." 
</P>
<P>
Huys, a native of Ghent, Belgium, who received his ballet training in Antwerp, 
had longed to join the company but had been frustrated that NYCB does not hold 
auditions. His success at the Prix de Lausanne competition won him a 
scholarship to the School of American Ballet in 1985, and after a year of study 
there, he achieved his long-held goal. 
</P>
<P>
However, Huys' first months at the school were frustrating. His Soviet-based 
early training was at odds with the speed and attack emphasized there. He was 
ready to head back to Europe but was persuaded to stick it out. 
</P>
<P>
While both dancers seem to recognize the significance and uniqueness of the 
Balanchine legacy and of the extensive challenges that NYCB repertory holds for 
them, each is also out to break some molds. 
</P>
<P>
Huys is concerned that he not be "stereotyped. . . . I would like to do as many 
different kinds of roles as I can. Otherwise, you don't develop into a complete 
dancer." 
</P>
<P>
He has his eye on several of Balanchine's knottier Stravinsky ballets, such as 
"Agon" and "Duo Concertante." 
</P>
<P>
Tracey mentions "Stravinsky Violin Concerto" as a Balanchine ballet that others 
might not picture her in but that she hopes to try. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey has acquired one of the primary traits associated with Balanchine's 
dancers: a boldness and energy on stage, a willingness to take chances and give 
a little extra. "I don't know how to hold back on stage," she said. "If I did, 
I'd feel I was cheating not only myself but also the audience, and I wouldn't 
have as much fun." 
</P>
<P>
What: The New York City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
When: Through Sunday, Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa.

THE CORNER BAR: SHIMMY, GRIND THE NIGHT AWAY AT EL MEXI-ROCK CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Down deep in South County, where 24-hour grocery stores and an occasional 
country-Western bar supply the main night life, there's a place where people 
can shake, shimmy, bump or grind until the wee hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
By day, El Mexi-Rock Cafe in Mission Viejo is just another pastel-colored 
medium-priced Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But when 9 p.m. rolls around, the DJ starts the speakers thumping and the floor 
is soon packed with pumping, gyrating bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Music ranges from the most overplayed dance hits to heavy soul, R &amp; B and 
rap, with an occasional heavy-metal anthem thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
The music brings in a diverse but young crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Long-haired hard-rockers rub shoulders with close-shaved hip-hoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed-to-kill dancers head out on the dance floor with steps that look as if 
they have been rehearsed for hours in front of the bathroom mirror. 
</P>
<P>
There's a rather small, cramped dance floor and the bar makes full use of its 
excellent sound system. The only way to have an intimate conversation is out in 
the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
El Mexi-Rock Cafe is equipped with neon lights, modern furniture and yuppified 
Mexican touches of tile floors and doorway arches. 
</P>
<P>
Food is also offered, but most patrons seem to take advantage of the cheap 
drink menu instead. 
</P>
<P>
After a cover charge of $3 (waved if you come before 10 p.m., or if you happen 
to be female on Wednesdays, Ladies Night), draft beer and mixed drinks are only 
a buck. 
</P>
<P>
The cafe also has a long happy hour from 3 to 9 p.m. and is one of the few 
clubs around that still offers discount drinks on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
And if that isn't enough, once a week women are treated to a male strip show 
and men can witness a female bathing suit contest. 
</P>
<P>
Who said there's nothing to do in South Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 El Mexi-Rock Cafe, 28411 Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo. Open 3 p.m. to 2 
a.m. Monday through Saturday. (714) 364-6674.

IN SEARCH OF GEMUTLICHKEIT? JOURNEY TO OLD WORLD OKTOBERFEST

As September flows into October, beer-drinking enthusiasts around the world 
dust off their steins, work up a thirst and set their sights toward Germany in 
anticipation of Oktoberfest. But for Southern Californians, Munich isn't the 
only place to enjoy authentic Oktoberfest festivities. 
</P>
<P>
An annual celebration at Old World Village in Huntington Beach this year begins 
Saturday, Sept. 29, and runs through Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
The 176-year-old tradition, which began in Munich as a celebration of a royal 
wedding, was instituted at Old World Village about 13 years ago by the Bischoff 
family, owners of the restaurant complex. "We visited the Oktoberfest in Munich 
in 1970 and thought it would be fun and successful in Huntington Beach," said 
Dolores Bischoff. "The whole festival is about being together. Old and young 
alike can participate and it's a great way to meet strangers in a relaxed 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Old World Village's cobblestone streets and the bucolic murals adorning its 
restaurant walls create an appropriate and convivial setting for Oktoberfest 
activities. The oom-pah-pah sound of Landshut, Germany's Lustigen Vilstaler 
Musikanten band -- making its U.S. debut at this year's festival -- will echo 
from Festival Hall, which serves as the focal point for the celebration. The 
food will include traditional specialties such as bratwurst, knackwurst, 
sauerkraut and apple strudel. There will be beers from around the world, 
including two from East Germany and a non-alcoholic option. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're in the mood to engage in the "Chicken Dance," this is your 
celebration. "The music really livens you up," said Bischoff, demonstrating the 
arm-flapping, foot-stomping dance that is a popular and cherished tradition at 
beer halls around the globe. For those more interested in observing, the 
Gypsies Folkloric Dance Ensemble will perform a traditional dance show 
throughout the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Official opening of this year's Old World Oktoberfest comes on Sunday, Sept. 
30, at 2 p.m., when a parade will wind through the Old World streets. The 
procession will include the Gypsies Folkloric Dance Ensemble and the Lustigen 
Vilstaler Musikanten band, all dressed in traditional costume. The band will 
continue to play until 9 p.m. in the Festival Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in Oktoberfest strive to achieve what the Germans call 
Gemutlichkeit, a harmony of tolerance, freedom and well-being. Bischoff feels 
that some may find it at the Old World Village celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see people go out with a sad face," she said. "In fact, they usually 
dance out." 
</P>
<P>

SILVER LINING: What's the good news about the Middle East crisis? . . . For 
Newport Beach, it's the rise in crude oil prices. Newport is the only city in 
California to own and operate oil wells, and since the invasion of Kuwait, 
revenue has increased by about $65,000 compared to the same period last year. . 
. . Says Bob Dixon, who manages the city wells, "If this held up for a year -- 
and, of course, we hope that it won't" -- the city could pocket an extra 
$442,000. Laura Michaelis and Kristina Lindgren

FATE OF POLL GUARD CASE TURNS SHAKY; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: A LETTER FROM THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS CHARGES MAY NOT 
BE FILED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE AND IT WAS A STATE, NOT FEDERAL, RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A U.S. Justice Department attorney investigating the Orange County Republican 
Party's 1988 placement of uniformed guards at polling places in Latino 
neighborhoods said in a recent letter that "it will be difficult" to bring 
criminal charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In the first comment about the nearly two-year criminal investigation, U.S. 
Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Bruce C. Navarro wrote that federal laws may not 
apply because there was no violence involved and the laws it has found 
regarding voter intimidation pertain only to federal races -- not one for state 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro, in a response to an inquiry by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), added, 
however, that there has not been a final determination about whether criminal 
charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he wrote: "It is becoming apparent to both (civil rights and criminal) 
divisions that it will be difficult to find a federal enforcement remedy for 
the sort of nonviolent patrolling of the exterior of polling precincts by 
private uniformed guards, such as that which appears to have taken place in 
Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
The poll guard case stems from the decision by county Republican Party leaders 
and the campaign of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) to hire guards at 
20 polling places in predominantly Latino neighborhoods of Santa Ana for the 
1988 general election. Some of the guards carried signs written in Spanish that 
warned those who were not citizens that it was illegal to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Republican officials said the guards were hired in response to rumors that 
Pringle's Democratic opponent was planning to bring busloads of illegal voters 
into the district. Pringle won the race by just more than 800 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The county Republican Party and Pringle's campaign later settled a civil suit 
out of court for more than $400,000 that was filed by five Latino voters who 
charged they were intimidated by the guards. 
</P>
<P>
Reuben Martinez, a Democratic activist and head of a group formed to seek a 
resolution of the case, said Wednesday that he was frustrated and depressed by 
the Justice Department letter. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some charges, and somebody better find them," he said. "I'm not 
going to let this end. This shows there is no justice for the Latino 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and other Latino community leaders have complained that Orange County 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, whose office participated in the joint criminal 
investigation, should be disqualified because he is receiving help in his 
current election campaign from some of the same Republican leaders being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said there is no conflict because he is not directly involved in the 
investigation and that it has been assigned to Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. 
Wade. 
</P>
<P>
"If this case had happened in Los Angeles or San Francisco, it would have been 
over long ago," Martinez said. "It's just the good-old-boy politics in the 
district attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and other protesters have begun picketing Capizzi's office every week. 
Today, Martinez and Wade are scheduled to meet and discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro's letter, dated Sept. 6, said the 1965 Voting Rights Act's 
anti-intimidation provision is only enforceable through "non-criminal lawsuits, 
similar to the one already successfully brought by some of the individual 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
In other federal law, he said there is only one criminal statute regarding 
nonviolent voter intimidation, one that would apply misdemeanor penalties in 
elections for federal office, but not Pringle's state Assembly race. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the investigation found that none of the guards were armed 
-- as had been claimed -- and none of the plaintiffs in the civil suit were 
actually deterred from voting by the guards. 
</P>
<P>
The letter wrongly states that the Republican Party dedicated part of its 
$400,000 settlement to "remedying whatever adverse impact may have been 
caused." Actually, it was the plaintiffs in the case who decided to contribute 
$150,000 of the settlement to voter registration efforts in the Latino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro was not available for comment Wednesday. Justice Department 
spokespersons and Deputy Dist. Atty. Wade also declined comment on details of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bates said the congressman's office is evaluating the letter. 
Bates' complaint also was filed with the Civil Rights and Immigration 
subcommittee for a possible congressional hearing. A subcommittee spokesman 
said it is also reviewing the Justice Department's response. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro's letter attributes the length of the investigation to the time 
necessary for the district attorney's office to complete its investigation and 
for the civil suit to be completed. The letter did not elaborate on why it was 
necessary for the civil suit to be concluded first.

ONTARIO AIRPORT CHIEF MAKES NOISE ABOUT STOPOVERS; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: SAYS REFUELING PRACTICE IS ANOTHER CASE OF ORANGE COUNTY UNLOADING 
ITS PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE. JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT MANAGER SAYS SHE'S HEARD NO 
COMPLAINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ontario International Airport Manager Michael Digirolamo said Wednesday a 
decision by several airlines to stop for refueling there in order to take off 
more quietly from John Wayne Airport is another example of how Orange County 
transfers its problems elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting dumped on by Orange County again," he said. "We're kind of upset 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
The unscheduled stops came to light this week when Seattle-based Alaska 
Airlines officials admitted that they were landing Seattle and Portland-bound 
flights there for refueling after taking off from John Wayne. The purpose was 
to comply with Orange County's noise restrictions -- the heavier the plane, the 
more engine thrust is needed at liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Digirolamo said that other airlines occasionally refuel at 
Ontario too, including Trans World Airlines, whose officials could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Most airlines, however, bump passengers or reduce seat sales to shed takeoff 
weight at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Digirolamo said Ontario shouldn't have to adopt noise limits because of extra 
air traffic generated by Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It also affects our ability to use our capacity for passenger service here," 
he said. "During the refueling stops these airlines are not picking up any of 
our passengers. They just stop and go." 
</P>
<P>
Because Orange County bars cargo jets from using John Wayne, Ontario is already 
being used to satisfy much of Orange County's air freight needs, Digirolamo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing to do this for north Orange County passengers and freight, which 
is close by, he added. But some of Ontario's air traffic is coming from 
southern Orange County too, only because Orange County is pushing its air 
traffic problems on surrounding counties. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, officials in San Bernardino and Riverside counties 
complained that Orange County was trying to dump its airport and jail 
overcrowding problems on its neighbors because of proposals to locate new 
Orange County facilities in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County officials have argued that urban problems are regional and 
deserve regional solutions. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne Airport Manager Jan Mittermeier, on her second day in that post, 
said Wednesday that she would not respond to Digirolamo's comments because he 
had not complained directly to her or other Orange County officials. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll have to talk to us if he has a problem," Mittermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county and Federal Aviation Administration officials said it was not 
within their jurisdictions to restrict airlines from making unscheduled stops 
on their routes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't handle that," said FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke. "There are no 
regulations I know of that affect this." 
</P>
<P>
That is little solace to passengers such as Kathleen Bernauer of Newport Beach, 
who said Wednesday that on a recent TWA flight to St. Louis, the crew did not 
announce the stopover in Ontario until the plane had left the gate. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked them if they were going to hold our connecting flights for us," 
Bernauer said, "and the reply was, 'No, we don't do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bernauer said she later applied by telephone for extra frequent flier miles 
because of the stopover in Ontario. "They flat out denied that TWA does this 
(refueling stops)," she explained. "They didn't believe me. That really ticks 
you off and it makes me very determined to fly other airlines." 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger who contacted The Times said that on a Sept. 4 flight to St. 
Louis, TWA's pilot announced that, because of head winds, they might have to 
stop for fuel somewhere, provoking sarcastic banter among passengers about over 
which city or state the plane would run out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Airlines officials said they began notifying pre-booked passengers in 
advance about the Ontario stopover a few days ago. The stopover is expected to 
be eliminated when a new time period for measuring airport noise begins Oct. 1.

TRAIN SWITCH VANDALIZED; 
</P>
<P>
DERAILMENT: TAMPERING BLAMED FOR FORCING CARS FULL OF ARTILLERY SHELLS TO JUMP 
TRACK. NAVY EXPERTS INSIST THERE WAS NEVER ANY CHANCE OF AN EXPLOSION.

<P>
Railroad officials on Wednesday said vandals apparently tampered with a railway 
switch and caused Tuesday night's derailment of a freight train that carried 
thousands of rounds of live artillery shells. 
</P>
<P>
Two locomotives and two boxcars on the nine-car Southern Pacific train jumped 
the track at the Hoover Street crossing, about 2 miles from Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station. The ammunition was being shipped from the base to Indiana for 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Currier, a superintendent with Southern Pacific railroad, said Wednesday 
that the train's three-man crew realized a railway switch was not working 
correctly as they approached the crossing at 10 m.p.h., but they could not stop 
the train in time. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad officials suspect vandals because the switch -- a device on the track 
that allows trains to change tracks -- had been tampered with, Currier said. 
Although it looked as if it was in the correct position, there were gaps, and 
its lock was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews blocked off the streets around the rail crossing and 
Westminster fire officials came close to evacuating several thousand people in 
the area. But naval ordnance experts called to the scene determined the cargo 
was undamaged and no evacuation was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no chance of it detonating in this particular accident. The packing 
was very well done and the cars stayed upright," Westminster Fire Chief Dwayne 
Scott said. "The next accident, however, you don't know what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said his crews were unable to immediately identify the types of 
explosives on board because the paperwork that described the cargo was in 
military code. He suggested that the Navy in the future include language that 
could be understood 
</P>
<P>
by civilian emergency crews. 
</P>
<P>
Scott also urged the military to find other ways to transport its materials, 
saying the hauling of live munitions through urban areas makes him extremely 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good to transport these materials through a metropolitan area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Stephen T. Holl, commanding officer at Seal Beach, said most of the 
base's munitions are moved by truck, but the rail line is used about six times 
a year. He said no accidents have occurred before, and added that rail is a 
safe and economical way to move the materials. 
</P>
<P>
"This ammunition is very safe," he said. "It's a very carefully controlled 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
The shells were wrapped with steel bands and packed tightly so they did not 
shift when the cars derailed, Holl said. 
</P>
<P>
The ammunition was fused, but Holl said it detonates only after an exact 
sequence of events. The projectiles would have to be jolted hard from behind, 
and then a mechanism senses whether there is a spinning motion. If there is no 
such centrifugal motion, they won't detonate. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be virtually impossible to duplicate that and cause it to detonate," 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Holl said the ammunition probably would not have exploded during a fire 
because the casings are thick. About 100 gallons of diesel fuel spilled in the 
derailment, but there was no fire. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the two cars that derailed were 2,304 38-caliber artillery shells that 
are 2 feet long and 5 inches in diameter. Two other cars were loaded with other 
ammunition, but they remained on the tracks. One contained 103,508 rounds of 
20-millimeter anti-missile shells and the other held 48 rounds of 16-inch 
projectiles. 
</P>
<P>
The shells were being shipped to a naval weapons support center in Crane, Ind., 
because they were outdated and can only be used on old battleships, Holl said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire crews, the first emergency teams to arrive on the scene, were in the 
dark about the types of explosives on board until Navy officials arrived 15 
minutes later to translate the manifests. All fire crews knew at first was that 
explosives were aboard, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we called them, the naval weapons depot responded very, very expediently. 
They identified exactly what was on board, so it put our minds at ease," Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we did not know exactly what was in the boxcar, we probably would have 
initiated evacuation in the nearby area. That would have reached a hospital, a 
senior citizens center and a convalescent hospital. It would have been an 
exceedingly difficult evacuation." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he worries about the codes because naval officials may be 
unavailable in the event of another such accident, or delayed in reaching the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run it turned out to be just a bunch of twisted track. But it's 
the potential, the what-ifs, that worry us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Thomas, a spokesman for the weapons station, said Wednesday that the cargo 
information is not classified and base officials will investigate changing the 
forms to assist emergency crews. 
</P>
<P>
"It is written somewhat in military jargon," he said. "We're required by Navy 
safety regulations to list it that way. Everyone within the military knows and 
understands it. But we will certainly investigate adding a column that says 
common names." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Scott said he would prefer that the base's ammunition be moved by 
ship, although he said this cargo destined for Indiana obviously had to go by 
rail. He said he knew before the accident that the tracks through the city were 
used occasionally to carry ordnance. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe (rail) is the best way, but it sure makes us feel uncomfortable here," 
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Gwen Forsythe, a Seal Beach councilwoman, said she was satisfied with the 
base's use of railroads. "I'm comfortable with the way this ammunition was 
transferred," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific's police team is investigating the apparent vandalism. No 
suspects have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
Each stretch of rail is inspected weekly by workers who use a special truck 
fitted with rail wheels that runs down the track. The track was inspected last 
week, and had been scheduled for another inspection Wednesday, said Southern 
Pacific road master Larry Magathan. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday morning, the stranded cars were towed back to the Seal Beach weapons 
station, where the ammunition was to be stored until it can be hauled out 
again. 
</P>
<P>
By dawn, about 15 Southern Pacific workers were busy repairing about 300 feet 
of twisted rails and torn railway ties at the corner of Westminster Boulevard 
and Hoover Street. Using a crane-like device, they hoisted the damaged rail and 
pulled broken ties out. 
</P>
<P>
Magathan, who is supervising the repairs, said new rails and ties were on the 
way, and predicted that the rails would be repaired and opened to traffic by 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railway Administration 
are not investigating the accident. The agencies usually get involved only when 
there are major injuries or property damage. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Jeffrey Perlman and Sonni Efron contributed to this report.

<P>
</P>
<P>
Westminster Train Derailment 
</P>
<P>
Authorities blamed vandalism for the derailment of a train loaded with 
ammunition from the U.S. Naval Weapons Station in Seal Beach. Two of the four 
boxcars loaded with ammunition, along with the two engines pulling the train, 
derailed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Cargo 
</P>
<P>
Four of the boxcars were loaded with three different types of ammunition, 
including 5-inch and 16-inch shells fired by large guns on battleships, and 
20-millimeter shells used against incoming missiles and aircraft.

LAGUNA BEACH COUNCIL, IRVINE CO. IN STALEMATE OVER PRICE OF CANYON 
</P>

<P>
Efforts to keep the Irvine Co. from developing a portion of scenic Laguna 
Canyon suffered a setback Wednesday when talks between the company and city 
officials broke down over the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. offered to sell the 2,150-acre Laguna Laurel site for $90 
million, but the city said it could not go above $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
The stalemate raised doubts as to whether both sides can come up with a plan in 
time to allow campaigning for a $20-million bond measure on the Nov. 6 ballot 
to help pay for the land. Supporters of the bond proposal, Measure H, said 
voters would not approve a tax increase unless they know how the bond will fit 
into an overall plan to save the canyon from development. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not yet thrown in the towel," said campaign manager Paul Freeman, who 
was hired by both the city and the Irvine Co. to help forge a purchase 
agreement. "But at the same time, the sand is running through the hourglass 
here. There's not much more time to dance." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert F. Gentry, a member of the negotiating committee, said he 
felt frustrated after Wednesday's three-hour bargaining session, but held out 
hope that the company would reduce its price. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the City Council came in with a substantial offer to buy the land, 
and I did not expect the company to be as rigid as it is. Sixty-five million 
dollars is not unrealistic at all for a community of 25,000, where the city 
would be giving up a number of projects it has on line in order to move its 
resources toward the purchase of the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said their offer was based on the land's appraised value of 
$105 million, plus $30.2 million in infrastructure improvements required in 
their development agreement with Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In its proposal, the company offered to exclude the $30.2-million cost and make 
a cash contribution at the end of a five-year buyout period of $15 million, for 
a total sales price of $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. Senior Vice President Gary Hunt said other incentives included 
eliminating the interest costs, estimated at $29 million, and selling 90% of 
the land in the first year for a down payment of $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,800 acres that would be available in the first year is located west of 
Laguna Canyon Road, where half of the project's 3,200 homes are scheduled to be 
built. Most of the property -- or 1,315 acres -- was targeted as open space in 
the Laguna Laurel development plan. Given the amount of land that would be sold 
the first year, Hunt argued that the proposal would be attractive to voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Short of giving it away, what more is there to do?" Hunt said. "From our 
perspective, we have moved mountains to get to what we think is a very, very 
fair plan." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents argued that the company's starting position of $135.2 million was 
unreasonable since it was based on the land being developed instead of being in 
its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and environmental groups, which had talked at one time of paying 
$50 million, made a counteroffer Wednesday of $65 million over a six-year 
period, including a $33-million down payment and $20 million due in the final 
year. During the session, the city informally raised its offer to $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said the city would have been required to raise $11 million in addition 
to the $20 million raised by Measure H if approved by voters. The city also was 
counting on a $10-million contribution from the county. 
</P>
<P>
He said that would have included postponing the construction of a proposed city 
parking garage and seeking state grants. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Neil Fitzpatrick, who is not a member of the negotiating team, said 
the city's offer was "a stretch" and counted on money it was not sure would be 
available. So the company's $90-million price tag, he said, was out of the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the company has had a reasonable idea as to what we could afford all 
along, and for us to try to get an offer that's just doomed to failure would 
really perpetuate fraud on the citizens," he said. "We have to give the 
citizens something that's doable." 
</P>
<P>
Added Councilman Dan Kenney: "We are talking about a substantial amount of 
money. If (the city's offer) was $70 million, that was equal to one-fifth of 
what (Irvine Co. Chief Executive Officer) Don Bren paid for the entire Irvine 
Co." 
</P>
<P>
The executive director of two environmental groups involved in the discussions, 
Michael Phillips, accused the company of losing sight of what $1 million means 
to ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the opportunity to save something. This cannot be all about money," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental groups -- Laguna Greenbelt Inc. and Laguna Canyon Conservancy 
-- are challenging in court the validity of the company's development agreement 
with the county. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Greenbelt President Elisabeth Brown said agreement has "artificially 
inflated" the value of the land and affected the land-purchase negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
If both sides cannot agree soon, Gentry said, the campaign to save the canyon 
"will be back to the trenches to modify and/or stop, that development, and I 
frankly hope we do not come to that."

TOLLWAY GRADING JOB BID ACCEPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bid for initial construction on the first of Orange County's three tollways 
was accepted Wednesday by the county Transportation Corridor Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The low bidder was the Ebiensteiner Co., based in Agoura Hills in northern Los 
Angeles County, which submitted a bid of $7.7 million to complete a 
half-mile-long grading project on the Foothill Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Before the project is officially awarded to the company, the bid must be 
approved by the Transportation Corridor Agencies board of directors, which is 
expected to review the matter Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be breaking ground," said TCA spokeswoman Donna Stubbs. "It's 
a significant step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Located near El Toro Road, the grading project is a small part of the 
$640-million publicly owned tollway that will run from the foothills through 
San Clemente toward the county line. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs called the project as "full-width" grading to clear the way for an 
eventual eight-lane toll road. But when the tollway is opened in 1993, she 
said, the road will accommodate two lanes of traffic in each direction. KEVIN 
JOHNSON

CEREMONY FOR OLD, NEW COMMANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Change-of-command ceremonies are scheduled for 3 p.m. Friday as Brig. Gen. 
David V. Shuter, the commanding officer of the Marine Corps Air Station in El 
Toro, retires and is replaced by Brig. Gen. Wayne T. Adams. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor ceremonies, with band music and troops in formation, repeat one of 
the oldest military traditions: saying goodby to the old commander and 
welcoming the new. 
</P>
<P>
Shuter, 53, has been commanding general of the air base at El Toro since Oct. 
6, 1987. He is completing 36 years of military service, and he and his wife 
will retire in the Orange County area, military officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, 50, was promoted to brigadier general -- one star -- on April 28, 1989. 
He previously directed a division of the Marine Corps' Installations and 
Logistics Department in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Adams is a native of southern Florida and received a bachelor's degree in 
political science and economics from the University of Alabama. His 29-year 
military record includes two tours of duty in South Vietnam during the war. He 
has accumulated more than 3,600 flight hours piloting fixed-wing and helicopter 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Adams and his wife have three children: Jeff, a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputy; Allison, a flight attendant, and Rob, a college student.

SCHOOL CROWDING RELIEF PLAN REVISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Newport-Mesa School Unified District officials have changed their 
recommendations for relieving overcrowding in the Estancia High School zone, 
proposing that both Adams Kindergarten Center and Victoria Elementary be 
reopened to house students from that area in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was met with applause by the approximately 30 parents 
attending the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
District staff members and parents have been working for months on a proposal 
to change boundaries and open new schools in Estancia zone, where all four 
elementary schools are expected to reach capacity within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the previous recommendation, Adams would have been opened in the fall of 
1991, and would have been changed from a kindergarten to a K-5 school. All 
sixth-graders in the district would then have attended TeWinkle Intermediate 
School. 
</P>
<P>
But, citing concerns about hourlong bus rides for some youngsters, Assistant 
Supt. Carol Berg said that the staff decided in favor of another alternative 
that will allow many of the students living near the Victoria site to walk to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current recommendation, Victoria and Adams will open as a K-5 school 
in September, 1992. During the 1991-92 school year, sixth-graders from 
California and Pomona Elementary schools would attend TeWinkle, while Wilson 
Elementary will become a 2-5 grade school. Adams will remain a kindergarten 
center, but will continue to house Wilson's first-graders to minimize the 
number of times that the children have to switch schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1992, there will also be new boundaries established for 
California, Pomona, Whittier and Wilson elementary schools, and all become K-5 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The interim year will be used to make construction repairs to Victoria and 
install enough portable classrooms to accommodate the estimated 400 students 
that will attend during the first year, said Student Services Director Dale 
Wooley. 
</P>
<P>
"We can make a pretty nice setup, though we will have to add a number of 
classrooms," Wooley said. The portable classrooms may reduce the playground 
area, but there "should be enough space for youngsters to play and have 
physical education programs." 
</P>
<P>
The board is scheduled to decide on one of 11 alternatives for relieving 
overcrowding in the Estancia zone on Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Wooley said that for the last three years, the district has seen a growth of 
about 500 students each year at the elementary school level. So far, the growth 
has meant the district has had to reopen Lincoln Junior High in Corona del Mar, 
and Wooley said that new school openings may also be needed in the Costa Mesa 
and Newport Harbor high school zones. LAURA MICHAELIS

BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AWARDED $19,882

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost $20,000 in federal grant money was awarded to the Boys and Girls Club by 
the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
Council members praised the other six community service organizations that also 
requested the money but voted unanimously to give the $19,882 from the Housing 
and Urban Development to the Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a local club and it serves all the children in the city. We felt that 
this one warranted the money because it has had financial problems in the last 
year that could have closed it down even," Councilwoman Anita Huseth said. "We 
felt it's helping the children to fight drug and delinquency, which are major 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The money will pay for a variety of programs aimed at steering youngsters away 
from gangs and drugs and provide tutoring and a supervised environment for 
children who need after-school care, said Ceil Miller, president of the club's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try and stretch that 20 grand to cover a lot of bases," she 
added.JON NALICK

NEIGHBORS HELP PULL FALLEN WORKER FROM 40-FOOT HOLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Some neighbors, a passer-by and a cushion of water helped save the life of a 
bulldozer operator who fell into a 40-foot-deep hole Wednesday at a 
construction site on Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Stinson, 35, of Costa Mesa clung to the sides of the muddy pit, keeping 
afloat in water collected at the bottom and yelling for help. He had been 
lifting a piece of plywood out of the way of his bulldozer before he fell, said 
Orange County Fire Department Capt. Dan Young. The hole had been dug to hold 
concrete pylons for a house to be built on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, his partner, Mark Gonsalves, heard the cries and shouted 
for help. Within minutes, a passing motorist and four neighbors -- one carrying 
200 feet of rope -- ran to the rescue and pulled the man to safety about 12:45 
p.m. Stinson was taken to Samaritan Medical Center of San Clemente, where he 
was treated and released, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said his superiors were recommending the neighbors for commendation for 
their efforts to save Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to overcome their fear to get this guy out," Young said. "It's 
encouraging to see people not just get involved but overcome their fear to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
The ordeal started when Stinson was driving his bulldozer on a vacant lot at 
35171 Camino Capistrano on Capistrano Beach, inspecting the area he would be 
grading to make way for a new oceanfront home. When he got off his bulldozer to 
remove a piece of plywood that was in his way, he slipped into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
There was about 10 feet of water in the bottom of the 3-foot-wide hole, Young 
said. Eleven other holes have been dug on the property. 
</P>
<P>
"The water probably saved his life," Young said, adding that several other 
holes paramedics checked didn't have any water in them. "It probably kept him 
from getting killed. But then it became his worst enemy. The first 10 seconds, 
'Thank God it was there.' Then after that, 'Oh my God.' " 
</P>
<P>
Young and neighbors said Stinson kept his head above the water by gripping the 
muddy sides. He suffered minor scratches and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Mel Chaitlin, 63, was in his dining room, perusing a newspaper's real 
estate section, tuning out the everyday voices of construction workers and the 
hums of their tractors next door. All of a sudden, the tone and pitch of the 
voices changed dramatically, he said, and neighbors on all sides of the vacant 
lot ran to their windows to see what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
"You figure you better get out there fast, you might be able to help," Chaitlin 
said from his home across the street from the construction site. 
</P>
<P>
Chaitlin, his wife, two other neighbors, two construction workers and a San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric employee who was driving by pulled Stinson out of the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
A County Fire Department ambulance and fire rescue truck arrived to take 
Stinson to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it was fun but it was a fabulous feeling to help save a life," 
Chaitlin said, adding that he didn't even get a chance to talk to Stinson.

INTERNAL AUDIT CLEARS UCI'S PSYCHIATRIC UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: NO EVIDENCE IS FOUND TO SUBSTANTIATE ALLEGATIONS OF FALSIFIED DRUG 
RECORDS OR IMPROPER BILLING OF MEDI-CAL.

<P>
An internal audit of UCI Medical Center's psychiatric unit has found no 
evidence of falsified prescription drug records or improper billing of Med-Cal 
for unapproved research drugs, university officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
After a 10-month investigation that included a review of the records of about 
60 psychiatric patients at the hospital in Orange, the university's internal 
audit department concluded that "Medi-Cal was not improperly billed for 
research drugs," according to the summary report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"What it means is that . . . there was no indication or finding of any 
impropriety," said Dr. Donald B. Summers, UCI Medical Center's chief of 
clinical psychiatric services. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was begun last November amid allegations by medical center 
employees that unidentified doctors falsely labeled research drugs with the 
names of approved drugs and illegally billed the state. The doctors allegedly 
kept two sets of medical records to hide the practice from Medi-Cal, which does 
not pay for research trials. 
</P>
<P>
Similar allegations are the focus of a second investigation by the state 
attorney general's division of Medi-Cal fraud. Don Kennedy, a senior 
investigator for the office in San Diego, said Wednesday that the investigation 
is continuing. UCI spokeswoman Karen Young said a copy of the internal audit 
findings would be forwarded to the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints that sparked the internal investigation were made in letters to 
hospital administrators by two UCI psychiatrists and an administrator for the 
department. The letters to Dr. William E. Bunney and Summers, the chairman and 
vice chairman, respectively, of UCI's department of psychiatry and human 
behavior, raised ethical and legal concerns about these practices, emphasizing 
that these same questions were raised months earlier but that department 
officials had taken no action. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said Wednesday that he and Bunney requested the internal audit in late 
October, 1989, and that at least two of the letter writers were informed of the 
investigation in a meeting on Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said Wednesday that he did not know why the investigation took so long, 
but auditors indicated that it was part of a continuing major audit of the 
95-bed hospital unit and psychiatric department. 
</P>
<P>
According to the audit report, the medical center was reimbursed by Medi-Cal 
for the hospital stays of some patients used in research studies. 
</P>
<P>
"However, Medi-Cal was not billed for the actual cost of the research drugs 
administered to these patients," wrote internal audit director Andrew C. 
Yeilding in the summary report to Mary A. Piccione, the medical center's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
As for keeping a "second set" of medical records, such practice is "standard 
procedure," the audit said, citing the director of research for the medical 
center's department of psychiatry and human behavior, Dr. Steven G. Potkin. 
Potkin was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that one set is the patient's medical record and the other 
is the research record of the patient's participation in research studies. 
</P>
<P>
The audit said such a research record is required by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, but that these are not part of the official hospital medical 
records and consequently "are not relevant to the hospital records used for 
billing procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Summers said that research drugs are generally supplied by the drug company 
supporting the studies and that "there is no way to generate a charge" for the 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Medi-Cal was never billed for any of these medications," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
A central part of the criticism that led to the internal investigation revolved 
around the labeling of drugs on patient records. Charts of patients who were 
receiving the research drugs Raclopride and Zacopride were variously labeled 
Haldol/R and Haldol/Z. 
</P>
<P>
Haldol, a brand name for the drug haloperidol, is an anti-schizophrenic drug 
approved by the FDA and reimbursable by Medi-Cal. It is a major tranquilizer 
used in treating psychotic disorders, severe behavior problems in children and 
hyperactivity in children. 
</P>
<P>
The audit called it standard practice in conducting medical research to use a 
"double blind" study and identify a drug by a code name in the medical record. 
Since the physician's orders and those in the medical center's pharmacy 
indicate the appropriate research drug, what is actually written in the medical 
record "is moot," the audit concluded. 
</P>
<P>
However, Summers said, when questions were raised about this labeling practice 
last October, he ordered a procedural change requiring that the drugs be more 
fully labeled to prevent confusion.

TROY SENIOR HAS SOMETHING ON THE BALL; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: STEVE FRIEDRICH IS ONE OF COUNTY'S TOP RECEIVERS. HE ALSO LED 
SCHOOL'S BASEBALL TEAM TO LEAGUE TITLE.

<P>
Whether he's crouched behind the plate or streaking through a secondary on a 
post pattern, Steve Friedrich of Troy High School has a knack for catching a 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich helped Troy win the Freeway League baseball championship this past 
spring by moving from the outfield to catcher and batting .353 with 26 hits. 
Friedrich, a natural outfielder with speed, had caught only three junior 
varsity games as a sophomore but earned all-league honors as a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Friedrich caught 36 passes for 633 yards and six touchdowns to lead 
Troy to a Division VI playoff berth. He already has 18 receptions for 218 yards 
and four touchdowns in three games this season. Tonight, Troy faces Valencia at 
Placentia's Bradford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen him play twice and it's pretty obvious the guy has very good 
hand-eye coordination," Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said. "He does things on a 
football field that you can't teach. I saw him catch a (long pass) against El 
Dorado two weeks ago and I was very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Troy Coach John Turek: "He seems to catch anything. He never seems to 
worry about getting hit, and when the ball is up for grabs, he seems to win the 
majority of the battles with defensive backs." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich had never played organized football before high school. He was a 
third-string tailback and started at free safety on the Troy freshman team, 
then was promoted to the varsity as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of watching from the sideline, Friedrich established himself as 
one of the county's top receivers in 1989, teaming with quarterback Greg Windle 
to lead Troy to a second-place finish in the Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran mostly post patterns last year, but this year Greg and I haven't really 
used any set patterns," Friedrich said. "Our passing game is a lot more 
complicated than last year." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich had the best game of his career last week in a 26-16 victory over 
Brea-Olinda. He caught nine passes for 93 yards, including touchdowns 
receptions of 25 and 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success on the football field, Friedrich's future appears to be in 
baseball. He attended the Stanford baseball camp last summer and is 
anticipating a big senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"My size (5 feet 10, 170 pounds) has a lot to do with my future," Friedrich 
said. "My future is probably in baseball. I've been playing baseball since my 
dad taught me how to play catch when I was 2 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich played in the Yorba Linda Little League and was a starting left 
fielder for Troy's junior varsity team as a freshman. He had played shortstop 
and in the outfield when Troy Coach Dane Illertsen asked him about catching 
before last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said it looked weird seeing someone with speed catching," Friedrich 
said. "But I really enjoyed catching. I liked the challenge of holding 
baserunners and I liked being in control of the pitchers and setting the 
infield." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich, who is projected as a collegiate outfielder, continued to polish his 
catching skills at the Stanford camp with 110 players from throughout the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot about hitting at the camp," Friedrich said. "I corrected a 
flaw in my swing, and I'll start working in the cages the day after football 
ends." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Friedrich will continue to torment secondaries as Troy hopes to end 
the eight-year reign of La Habra and Sunny Hills as champion of the Freeway 
League. Troy was ranked among the county's top teams in most preseason polls, 
but the Warriors fell from the top 10 after their loss to Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we're not rated," Friedrich said. "Last year we stayed away from 
publicity and had a good season. We had a good spring and everyone was excited 
going into this season. But for some reason, we weren't mentally ready for 
Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss was probably good for us. It made us realize we can lose any time 
we're not ready to play. All along, our goal has been to win the league title." 
</P>
<P>
Turek, who has led Troy to six consecutive playoff berths, expects Friedrich to 
play a key role in the team's drive for a league title. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate Steve breaking the school records for receiving if he stays 
healthy," Turek said. "He's getting more double coverage than we've seen in 
awhile, but he's still averaging six catches and has scored in every game."

10 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
Running in the Shadows: Edison High was learning to live without running back 
Kerwin Bell, who had graduated and went on to a successful career at Kansas. 
Bell had led Edison to a Big Five Conference championship in 1979 and, despite 
graduating the entire backfield from that team, the Chargers were ranked No. 1 
by The Times at the start of the 1980 season. 
</P>
<P>
In its third week, Edison struggled to defeat El Modena, 13-3. In that victory, 
Bell's younger brother Dino gained 35 yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
The Times ran a series exploring the pressures placed on high school athletes. 
One theory was the "Little League Syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa clinical and sports psychologist Richard Lister said the syndrome 
occurred when parents tried to overcome their athletic deficiencies through the 
glory of their children. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fine line between being zealous and being overzealous," Lister said. 
"And when it happens, it kills the interest for the kids involved." 
</P>
<P>
One notable parent that year was former Ram star receiver Jack Snow, whose son 
J.T. was a quarterback at Los Alamitos High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I do my best not to be an 'armchair quarterback,' " Jack Snow said. "You can 
pick them out real easily -- they're usually the loudest." 
</P>
<P>
Snow could have been excused for cheering loudly, though. J.T. Snow completed 
12 of 22 passes for 259 yards and three touchdowns in Los Alamitos' 34-13 
victory over Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 YEAR AGO 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gragnano and Erik Mitchell led Los Alamitos to a 42-8 victory over 
Compton. Los Alamitos, which had been upset the previous week, scored 36 points 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had 106 yards and scored three touchdowns. Gragnano completed 16 of 26 
passes for 248 yards and two touchdowns. Gragnano and Mitchell teamed on a 
62-yard scoring pass play. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest numbers were posted by Rancho Alamitos' Dana Riddle. He carried 
the ball 52 times for 248 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
While Riddle was getting noticed for big numbers, Bolsa Grande's Sonny Nguyen 
was getting noticed for little things -- his uniform. Nguyen at 5-feet-6, 120 
pounds was the smallest starting varsity quarterback in the county and led 
Bolsa Grande to a 16-14 victory over Pioneer. Nguyen completed six of 10 passes 
for 122 yards and a touchdown, ran for one touchdown and kicked an extra point 
and a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The little things counted for Marina too. It made a step in the right direction 
by ending an 18-game losing streak with a 17-7 victory over Lakewood.

OIL PRICES ROCKET BUT BUSH'S MOVE MAY HELP CALM THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In trading that saw rumors of war overwhelm reason, oil prices topped $39 a 
barrel and closed up sharply Wednesday. But prices are expected to fall now 
that President Bush has said he will tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an 
attempt to calm frenzied oil markets. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for November delivery surged $1.14 to finish at $38.67 a barrel, the 
latest in a string of record closing prices in the last week and the highest 
close since crude futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
The high during the trading day was $39.05, just short of the previous high of 
$39.20 reached on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new survey showed that the average retail price of regular 
unleaded gasoline in California rose 6 cents in the last month to $1.372 a 
gallon, defying normal seasonal trends. The survey of 600 California stations 
by the California State Automobile Assn. also found price variations of as much 
as 45 cents a gallon between different stations for the most popular grade of 
motor fuel. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday, crude oil prices opened lower 
and traded as low as $36.48 in reaction to American Petroleum Institute 
statistics released the day before showing ample supplies of crude, gasoline 
and heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
The API, the oil industry's main trade group, reported Tuesday that U.S. crude 
stocks of 364 million barrels in the week ending Sept. 21 were down slightly 
from the week before but remained 33 million barrels above the level of a year 
ago. Stocks of both gasoline and distillates, which include home heating oil, 
were above week-ago and year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
But fear soon overcame economic fundamentals Wednesday, and prices quickly 
rallied as Persian Gulf-related rumors drifted across the trading floor. The 
first was that an Iraqi jet had been shot down over the Persian Gulf; the next, 
that the United States had given an ultimatum to Iraq to get out of Kuwait 
within 48 hours, and the last, that Iraqi troops had stormed the U.S. Embassy 
in Kuwait City. 
</P>
<P>
All of the rumors turned out to be unfounded, though Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III did confirm later that Iraq had demanded a list of non-diplomats 
who have taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy and threatened to hang some of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We come back to the problem: Which is more important? The fundamentals of 
supply and demand, or rumors and psychology?" asked Peter Beutel, an oil 
analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "This morning, it 
was the fundamentals. This afternoon, it was psychology." 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for delivery in months after November also closed up, and traders and 
analysts again saw oil markets, which had appeared to peak Tuesday, testing the 
$40-per-barrel limit and remaining nervous in the absence of a material change 
in the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But prices could fall sharply today. After markets closed Wednesday, Bush said 
he would tap 5 million barrels of the 590-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Refined products closed mixed Wednesday. Unleaded gasoline for October delivery 
initially fell sharply in reaction to the API figures. They showed national 
gasoline inventories at 222.3 million barrels, 5.3 million barrels above the 
level of a week ago and 3 million barrels ahead of last year as the summer 
driving season comes to an end. 
</P>
<P>
But October gasoline gained back some of its losses and closed down 1.95 cents 
at $1.001 per gallon. Gasoline for later delivery closed up. 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil for October delivery closed up 1.37 cents at $1.0257. Heating oil 
in later months closed up much higher in anticipation of winter demand: 
December heating oil was up 2.48 cents at $1.0477 a gallon.

HYATT TOUCH LEAVES LABOR TOUCHY; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGEMENT: TOP EXECUTIVES TAKE A TURN WORKING IN THE FIRM'S HOTELS. REGULAR 
EMPLOYEES IN L.A. PROTEST THEIR LACK OF A UNION PACT AND WHAT THEY CALLED 
DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's the sort of gaffe for which demanding hotel queen and tax cheat Leona 
Helmsley might have canned the doorman: A smartly uniformed Darryl 
Hartley-Leonard crisply closed the taxi door and watched the vehicle speed away 
before he realized he'd put the wrong luggage inside. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that incident at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, Hartley-Leonard's job at 
Hyatt Hotels Corp. was secure. He is, after all, president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
That was last year, when corporate employees of Hyatt Corp. and its domestic 
hotel subsidiary spent a day lugging bags, serving lunches and pouring drinks 
as part of an unusual program to bring those at the top closer to customers and 
the work force at Hyatt hotels. 
</P>
<P>
They were at it again Wednesday, but the second annual "Hyatt In Touch Day" was 
accompanied by a sour note as some Los Angeles employees protested their lack 
of a union contract and what they called discriminatory management practices 
with the slogan, "Beware the real Hyatt Touch." 
</P>
<P>
"Hyatt's executives can never know what it's like to work for Hyatt in Los 
Angeles," Maria Elena Durazo, president of a union local that represents 
employees at three Hyatt hotels in Los Angeles, said at a news conference and 
rally outside the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles downtown Wednesday morning. "We're 
outraged and angered at Hyatt Corp.'s attempt to make a mockery of the very 
real and very difficult working conditions of its workers." 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt launched its In Touch Day last year after executives realized that most 
of the 430 corporate employees had never worked in a hotel, Hartley-Leonard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of line employees was, "How the heck do you guys know what's going 
on out here?" Hartley-Leonard recalled. 
</P>
<P>
So the corporate offices in Chicago were closed and everyone there, plus some 
regional management employees, was dispatched to one of Hyatt's 106 domestic 
hotels. Today, selected hotel employees will shadow the corporate types to see 
what they do. 
</P>
<P>
The process is not without precedent, said Tom Pritzker, president of Hyatt 
Corp. and a member of the rich and powerful Pritzker family that owns Hyatt. 
</P>
<P>
"Mao Tse-tung used to send all the bureaucrats back into the fields," said 
Pritzker, who spent the day as a doorman, waiter and bellhop. "He did it for 
two or three years at a crack. That was a bit extreme." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Azark, vice president of Hyatt's hotel development unit, stood at the 
entrance of the Hyatt at Los Angeles Airport Wednesday morning in a doorman's 
white cap and coat, awaiting luggage-bearing guests. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trained as an architect," Azark said. "This gets us back in touch with our 
customers and our employees. Given the demands of our day to day jobs, it's 
easy to lose sight of that." 
</P>
<P>
While Hyatt's "In Touch Day" is not one of a kind, few companies appear do this 
sort of thing on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott Corp. takes a slightly different approach, spokeswoman Eileen Peterson 
said. New employees usually are indoctrinated with basic hotel work before they 
take their jobs, and veterans periodically head back to the hotels for a 
refresher, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done that for years and years," Peterson said, adding that many 
executives frequently pitch in to help with hotel tasks. 
</P>
<P>
If it works, such a back-to-basics program can be good for employee morale, 
said Wendy Kheel, manager of the real estate and hospitality practice at 
Laventhol &amp; Horwath, an accounting firm whose specialties include 
consulting for the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, the only time you see management working on the line is during a 
strike," Kheel said. "It's hard to say how much exposure in one day the top 
management is getting to the needs of the public. . . . But, on the other hand, 
it can't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it might be fun from the customer's point of view to know that a 
Pritzker is carrying your bag," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the program hit a snag. The Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant 
Employees Local 11, which represents about 12,000 workers in Los Angeles 
including about 600 at three Hyatt hotels, staged demonstrations with workers 
carrying banners that read "The Hyatt Touch Hurts L.A." and "Hyatt is Out of 
Touch with L.A." 
</P>

The workers at the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles, Hyatt Wilshire and Hyatt on 
Sunset have been without a contract for more than a year and Local 11 has 
staged a variety of public incidents -- including mass "wake-up calls" for 
guests by banging drums in front of the hotels at 6:30 a.m. -- to embarrass 
Hyatt into signing a contract already adopted by several other hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Formal negotiations have stalled over a few issues, and union officials say 
that workers' health benefits are now in jeopardy because Hyatt won't make the 
higher contributions to the benefits fund that it has already agreed to make. 
The chain has refused to do so until a contract is signed. Hyatt Regional Vice 
President Cody Plott said the company has never been told that the benefits are 
in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The union also alleged a history of racial and sexual discrimination and 
harassment by the company and said Hyatt employees are the worst paid among Los 
Angeles hotel workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite an insult," said Pearl Daniels, a telephone operator at the Hyatt 
on Sunset for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to come in and wear our uniforms and say they're going to get in 
touch with us? How are they going to do that?" she said. "I can't afford to pay 
my bills." 
</P>
<P>
Hartley-Leonard defended his company's record, adding that Hyatt has a good 
relationship with its unions beyond this local dispute. Last year's In Touch 
Day led to a continuing series of meetings between management and employees to 
discuss what's going on in the company, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew this stunt was going to be pulled, but by damn I wasn't going to let 
it spoil the day," he said. "We're a good, honorable, caring organization. . . 
. We'll work our way through this."

JAPANESE UNLIKELY TO LET U.S. OPINION SWAY DEAL MAKING

Watching Sony Corp. fend off a barrage of criticism over its purchase of 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. last fall, Matsushita Electric Industrial 
Co. couldn't help taking a stab at its brash young competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"We too have been asked by Japanese banks to buy U.S. film companies," 
Matsushita Executive Vice President Shoji Sakuma was quoted as saying then. 
"But we have refused offers because we thought the movie industry was something 
special to Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Matsushita considers the purchase of entertainment conglomerate MCA 
Inc. for as much as $7.6 billion, it may find itself playing Sony's part and 
writing itself a new script. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not at all sure there is anything special about the film industry; many 
Americans have told me there isn't," one Matsushita official said Wednesday, 
admitting that the reaction of the American public is a consideration in the 
talks. "Depending on the method of acquisition, the reaction would be 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita would maintain existing management and avoid layoffs, making its 
approach more acceptable in the United States, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The electronics company's change in attitude underscores the difficulty that 
the Japanese government is having in getting industry to avoid buyouts that 
might anger the American public and complicate trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions also indicate that although Japan's stock market drop and 
higher interest rates may have cooled interest in U.S. stocks, bonds and real 
estate, it has not significantly slowed corporate Japan's pursuit of American 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"You will see less of the highly leveraged finance company buying up real 
estate in the U.S.," said one U.S. investment banker based in Japan. However, 
he added, "where there are strong business reasons for making a (corporate) 
acquisition, they will go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
And where there are strong business reasons, Japanese corporations are unlikely 
to let U.S. public opinion deter them. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, to avoid conflict, Japanese companies are increasingly trying to hide 
their involvement in U.S. deals by using shell companies and declining to talk 
to the press. That was the case in the recent acquisition by a Japanese concern 
of Pebble Beach Co., owner of prestigious golf courses and other properties on 
the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese acquirers are also trying to put their actions in a more positive 
light, arguing that U.S. companies are initiating the deals because they 
appreciate the Japanese buyers' proclivity to invest for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't always work. Masaaki Morita, vice president of Sony Corp. of America 
and brother of Sony Chairman Akio Morita, tried to put the furor over the 
Columbia Pictures acquisition behind him by announcing earlier this year that 
the company would "return to its mainstay electronics business and move away 
from mergers and acquisitions." Nevertheless, Sony's purchase of Columbia has 
become a symbol of what critics call Japan's "buying up of America." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear if Matsushita is ready to put up with the kind of criticism Sony 
faced, risking a tarnished reputation for the broad array of products it sells 
in the United States under such labels as Panasonic and Quasar. 
</P>
<P>
"Matsushita is a conservative company," says Masatomo Azuma, analyst at 
Yamaichi Research Institute. "If there is too much controversy, they could pull 
out. They don't want to make waves." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the acquisition may prove too tempting to resist. Investors, at least, 
think that there is a good case to be made. Matsushita's American Depositary 
Receipts (the vehicle for buying its shares on the New York Stock Exchange) 
rose $2 to close at $122 Tuesday after the announcement. In Tokyo, the share 
price fell only after investors showed some skepticism over whether Matsushita 
would complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Investors say Matsushita's purchase of MCA would give the company an important 
new growth area. "The entertainment business has more growth potential than the 
hardware side," says Takatoshi Yamamoto, an analyst at the Tokyo office of the 
U.S. securities firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers point out that with growth of videocassette recorders slowing, 
Matsushita needs a new product to fuel sales. 
</P>
<P>
High-definition television, a new technology that promises to bring cinematic 
sharpness to television tubes, could fit the bill. But its commercialization is 
many years away. 
</P>
<P>
Still, access to the video talents of a firm such as MCA would put Matsushita 
in a stronger position versus Sony in the transition to a new generation of 
video products based on high-definition television.

U.S. WITHHOLDS C-17 PAYMENTS TO MCDONNELL; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE AIR FORCE IS REFUSING TO PAY UP TO $125 MILLION A MONTH, 
DOCUMENTS SAY. THE MILITARY IS ALSO EVALUATING DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT'S FINANCES.

The Pentagon has suspended contract payments to McDonnell Douglas Corp. on the 
$30-billion C-17 cargo jet program and has begun a major evaluation of the 
financial condition of the firm's Douglas Aircraft unit in Long Beach, the Air 
Force disclosed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension began in August, but the Air Force did not disclose how much is 
being withheld. The service said the action was taken because McDonnell is 
re-examining its costs to complete the C-17 program and that "progress payments 
are being withheld until this review is complete." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials did not elaborate on the statement, but such suspensions 
are often imposed if a contractor fails to make adequate progress on a program 
or has deficiencies in its work. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Aircraft confirmed that the Air Force has stopped making C-17 payments. 
"We are in discussions with them on that," spokesman Don Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, internal McDonnell Douglas documents obtained Wednesday by The Times 
raise serious questions about whether the company's C-17 cost projections were 
valid. The Air Force apparently concluded that they were not. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the documents, it appears that the Air Force is declining to pay as 
much as $125 million per month. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of that much money could be disastrous for McDonnell Douglas because 
the firm has suffered serious financial pressures in the past year. McDonnell's 
debt rating has twice been downgraded as the firm has sharply increased 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. George Sillia, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon, said the 
suspension applies to the periodic progress payments that the military services 
make to a contractor as it completes work on a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation of the financial condition of Douglas, where the C-17 is being 
assembled, is due to be completed in October and will include the firm's 
commercial business, Sillia said. Douglas also builds the MD-80 and MD-11 
commercial airliners. The reason for the Pentagon study is to determine 
Douglas' financial health in light of the slowdown in the C-17 program ordered 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced planned production of the C-17 from 
210 aircraft to 120 in a budget-cutting exercise and cut planned fiscal 1991 
purchases of the plane from six to two. Since then, the Senate has voted to cut 
all C-17 production funding for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We are telling Congress that they have to fund two aircraft for 1991 or there 
will be a gap in production, and turmoil," Sillia said. The financial 
evaluation, called a cost performance review, is at least in part an effort to 
document how changes in the C-17 production schedule will affect the 
corporation, Sillia said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), whose staff released the internal McDonnell 
documents to The Times, said the firm has recently incurred sharp cost overruns 
on the C-17 project and that some areas of the program are 100% over budget. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell charged that a "management collapse" at McDonnell Douglas has occurred 
and that each C-17 will cost $400 million, making it the most expensive 
noncombat aircraft in history. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell staff members said the Air Force is attempting to rescue McDonnell by 
relaxing requirements that the C-17 complete certain milestones before 
additional funding can be released. 
</P>
<P>
Sillia disputed the contention that C-17 costs have continued to grow, but he 
acknowledged that the Air Force is attempting to seek approval to alter the 
terms of the contract to allow release of certain funds before the company 
completes as much work as it was supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell officials asserted that the documents released by Dingell only 
confirm what the company has publicly disclosed -- that the C-17 is far over 
its target cost but that it has not broken through the cost ceiling above which 
all financial liability would fall on the company. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cave, McDonnell's deputy general manager for business planning and 
management on the C-17, said it is not fair to presume that the company's costs 
are continuing to grow, though he declined to say whether McDonnell has 
exceeded its engineering contract ceiling since April. 
</P>
<P>
Documents released by Dingell show that McDonnell was $836 million over its 
budgeted cost on the engineering portion of the program as of last April but 
still about $300 million under the $4.9-billion ceiling for C-17 engineering. 
</P>
<P>
If the company does exceed its contract ceiling substantially, it could create 
severe financial pressures on the already heavily indebted firm. McDonnell's 
credit rating has been twice downgraded, and it is facing heavy cost overruns 
on another military aircraft program, the A-12 Navy attack jet. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell officials in recent months have sought to portray the C-17 program as 
getting more healthy.

Injection Wells Ordered Closed: Six Southern California firms were told by the 
Environmental Protection Agency to halt underground dumping of contaminated 
fluids. Part of an ongoing EPA enforcement effort, the firms were accused of 
violating the federal Safe Drinking Water Act -- but not posing an immediate 
danger to any drinking water supplies -- by disposing of oil, degreasing 
solvents and other wastes in the wells. Named were: Ball &amp; Sons Auto, 
Malibu; Sierra Toyota, Lancaster; Trancas Canyon Chevron, Malibu; Foothill 
Chevrolet, La Canada; B. &amp; H. Repair, Corona, and Daily Tire &amp;

Senators Urge Aid for Pickens: Thirty two senators urged the Bush 
Administration to pressure Koito Manufacturing Co., a Japanese auto parts 
supplier, into seating corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. on its board. 
Although Pickens is Koito's largest single shareholder, the firm's management 
has refused the Texan's attempts to gain either a board seat or access to 
confidential corporate information. Pickens has attempted to turn his battle 
into an international trade issue, arguing that his rejection by Koito 
symbolizes the closed nature of Japanese corporate culture.

NEIL BUSH FUDGED ON ETHICS -- REGULATOR 
</P>

The failed savings and loan association where Neil Bush was a director had a 
strict code of ethics requiring officials to avoid any action that might "in 
any way" be a conflict of interest, and the President's son ignored the rules, 
a federal regulator testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"A director is required to give full disclosure to other directors," said 
regulator Terry Sandefur, offering an emphatic shorthand summary of the case 
against Bush. He is accused of failing to inform his colleagues on the board of 
Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. that he had important business 
connections with Bill L. Walters and Kenneth M. Good, two big borrowers at 
Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there is nothing more than an appearance of conflict of interest, "the 
director should seek to avoid that situation," said Sandefur, the assistant 
deputy district director for the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS is seeking a cease-and-desist order barring Bush from any future 
violation of conflict of interest regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Because the collapse of hundreds of S&amp;Ls will cost taxpayers $130 billion, 
the role of the President's son in the Silverado case is drawing nationwide 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
His defenders portray Neil Bush, who was 30 when he joined the Silverado board 
in 1985, as an honest but naive young man who is being persecuted because he is 
the President's son. But federal regulators say Neil Bush was supporting 
Silverado financing for Good and Walters without disclosing that they were 
bankrolling his oil exploration business. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the OTS complaint, Bush is one of the defendants in a 
$200-million suit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. against the Silverado 
directors. Walters and Good defaulted on more than $130 million in loans at 
Silverado during the three-year period when Bush served on the board. 
</P>
<P>
The Silverado code of ethics, made available by the OTS on Wednesday, said 
officers and directors should "keep themselves free of influences that might 
conflict or appear to conflict" with the S&amp;L's interest. 
</P>
<P>
Directors also should submit annual statements covering potential conflicts of 
interest, and should offer special submissions "if the director feels any of 
his activities, interests or relationships might possibly give rise to a 
conflict of interest," according to the Silverado ethics guide, dated April 24, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The officer or director's statements should "include any activity that might in 
any way be deemed to constitute" a conflict of interest, the document said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will conclude today with the long-awaited appearance of Neil Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Davidson, the administrative law judge handling the case, will decide 
next year whether to recommend issuing the cease-and-desist order against Bush. 
The final decision will be made by Timothy Ryan, the OTS director. His ruling 
can be appealed to the courts.

NBC News Way Over Budget: Persian Gulf crises coverage has pushed NBC News $15 
million to $20 million over budget this year, NBC News President Michael 
Gartner told a gathering of TV news directors in San Jose. The network's news 
division, which employs about 1,000 people, has a 1990 budget of about $250 
million, and after several years of losses, executives had expected the 
operation to finally break-even for the year. 
</P>
<P>
But a special "contingency fund" included in the budget is already exhausted. 
Coverage in the Persian Gulf is costing NBC about $1 million a week, Gartner 
said, and as a result the network will cut its staff in the region to 50 from 
80. Gartner said breaking the budget will not effect NBC News' plans to hire an 
additional 100 people to staff two new prime-time magazine shows.

New signs of economic sluggishness emerged Wednesday as the Commerce Department 
reported that durable goods fell 0.8% in August and that consumer spending rose 
0.5% last month. 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods are items designed to last more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
A few bright spots appeared in the weak durable goods report, such as defense 
orders, which steamed ahead as the U.S. committed its forces to the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But the overall picture shows a slowing economy teetering on the edge of 
recession, with higher oil prices soaking up what little spending power there 
is, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department also reported that U.S. incomes inched up 0.3% in 
August -- the smallest rise in four months.

Hills Finds Airbus Loan 'Disturbing': U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson 
Hills, who is complaining about European subsidies to Airbus Industrie, finds a 
loan that the jet maker made to Northwest Airlines "particularly disturbing," a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>

Hills believes that the $500-million loan was an unfair inducement to get 
Northwest to buy 75 jets built by Airbus, a four-nation European consortium. In 
a Sept. 14 letter to the European Community, Hills said she wants 
"clarification and information" about the loan as soon as possible, said 
spokeswoman Torie Clarke. Representatives of Airbus and the European Community 
deny that the loan was unfair.

NEW BANK DEPOSIT INSURANCE RULES URGED

The Bush Administration wants to raise deposit insurance fees for reckless 
banks and limit how many insured accounts a depositor may have, a senior 
Treasury Department official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber also suggested that the 
Administration may seek to force banks to conduct commercial real estate 
lending through separate affiliates that would not use insured deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Glauber's comments came in a progress report to the Senate Banking Committee on 
an uncompleted study by his department that is intended to serve as the 
starting point for a major overhaul of the financial system next year. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Administration favors charging banks making risky loans or 
operating with low capital more for insurance than conservatively run banks. 
Glauber said the Treasury is "closely examining" proposals that would combine 
government deposit insurance with private insurance to provide guidance for 
setting premium levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also favors limiting the number of insured accounts per 
depositor. Depositors can now insure far more than the $100,000 per account 
limit by dividing their money among several institutions or among single, joint 
and trust accounts at a single institution. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other "particularly attractive" options, Glauber said, are: 
</P>
<P>
* Requiring the owners of banking companies that wish to expand into areas 
traditionally barred to banks, such as securities underwriting and insurance, 
to increase their capital investment in their companies. 
</P>
<P>
* Giving federal regulators the power to curb risky bank activities permitted 
under some state laws. 
</P>
<P>
* Limiting "pass-through" insurance for pension funds and other large 
institutional investors. Under current rules, a deposit by a pension fund with 
100 members would have protection equaling 100 times the $100,000 insurance 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
* Using improved accounting techniques to give regulators a more up-to-date 
picture of a bank's health. 
</P>
<P>
* Forcing regulators to crack down on weak institutions before they fail. 
</P>
<P>
* Requiring annual, on-site examinations of large banks and ailing banks. 
</P>
<P>
Glauber steered clear of the most delicate deposit insurance issue -- how to 
discourage regulators from protecting all deposits in large banks, even those 
over the insurance limit.

COMPUTER FILE: DIGITAL RESEARCH TAKES A BIG STEP WITH ITS DR DOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times.

<P>
If you're about to install a larger hard disk in your IBM or compatible 
computer, or about to buy a new computer, you might want to consider changing 
the operating system from the traditional IBM or Microsoft offering as well. 
</P>
<P>
Digital Research Inc., the Monterey, Calif., software firm whose CP/M operating 
system ran an earlier generation of small-business computers, has a powerful 
alternative to DOS in its new operating system called DR DOS, version 5.0 
($199). 
</P>
<P>
The new DR DOS has all the features of regular DOS version 3.31, plus 
enhancements that, among other things, help you better manage your computer's 
memory, use large-size hard disks, control the cursor blink, keep track of your 
files and do simple text editing. 
</P>
<P>
Computer must have operating system software, because without it they simply 
won't run. 
</P>
<P>
DR DOS, which works on IBM and compatible computers, is compatible with 
Microsoft and IBM versions of DOS and has a lot of additional features. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most obvious is ViewMax. It uses graphic symbols of file folders and 
printed pages to show where files are stored on disk. Of course, you have the 
option of using old-fashioned directory lists, just like regular DOS, if you 
want. Or you can see files in a third depiction called a "tree," with each 
directory on your hard disk displayed as if it were a "branch" of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
No matter which option you choose, opening a file is as simple as pointing to 
it with the mouse or cursor keys and pressing the mouse button or Enter key. 
</P>
<P>
One of the small but important advantages offered by DR DOS over DOS is the 
ability to change the size and blink rate of the cursor. That is particularly 
helpful on laptop computers, where the cursor often gets lost on a dim screen. 
</P>
<P>
If your computer has an 80286 or 80386 microprocessor, DR DOS has special 
memory management software that lets you reduce the amount of the memory (up to 
640 kilobytes) that the operating system takes up. This frees memory for larger 
application programs, larger files or memory-resident utility programs. 
</P>
<P>
DR DOS can also convert extended memory greater than 1 megabyte in a computer 
into a form called expanded memory, which is more commonly used by software 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Such memory management software has typically been purchased separately by 
computer users to overcome DOS' limitations or obtained with the purchase of 
memory-hungry programs such as Microsoft's Windows. 
</P>
<P>
One important feature for today's computers with larger hard disks is DR DOS' 
ability to manage disks as large as 512 megabytes of storage as a single drive 
(One megabyte is 1 million characters). Most versions of MS-DOS are limited to 
drives of 32 megabytes or fewer, so large-capacity hard disks must be 
artificially divided into multiple logical drive units, called partitions. (The 
disk is not physically changed, but DOS will look only at a part of it, so that 
it never has to manage more than 32 megabytes of file storage at a time. Each 
partition is named after a succeeding letter of the alphabet, as in Drive C, 
Drive D, Drive E.) 
</P>
<P>
But with DR DOS -- as well as IBM DOS 4.0 and Microsoft DOS version 3.31 -- the 
entire disk up to 512 megabytes can be addressed at once, providing room for 
very large files and lots of programs. 
</P>
<P>
A good time, therefore, to consider changing operating systems on your computer 
is when you install a larger hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, perhaps the best feature, from my perspective, is a program called 
Editor, which is included with DR DOS. It is, in computer parlance, a 
full-screen text editor -- instead of the tedious one-line-at-a-time editor of 
regular DOS. Editor works like a simple word processor to display and edit the 
entire contents of a text file, no matter how large. It uses the old WordStar 
commands, which are familiar to many longtime computer users. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest way to get DR DOS is ask your dealer to install it instead of 
regular DOS when you buy a computer. Not all dealers carry it. Or, the new 
computer may have DOS pre-installed. 
</P>
<P>
Changing an existing operating system is not something that every user should 
consider doing. It is best left to those who like to experiment with their 
machines and have learned enough about how they work not to be intimidated by 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But DR DOS is easier to install than upgrading an older version of DOS to a new 
version of either Microsoft or IBM DOS. The reason is that DR DOS isn't fussy 
about where its files are stored on the disk, unlike regular DOS. 
</P>
<P>
DR DOS can coexist with the other DOS on the same disk if you want to take the 
trouble to create alternative start-up programs so that you can control which 
one takes over at boot-up time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DR DOS 5.0 
</P>
<P>
A $199 alternative operating system for IBM and compatible computers. 
</P>
<P>
Features: Visual interface to display and manipulate files and directories, 
controls cursor size and blink, extended and expanded memory management, full 
screen editor, command history, password protect files and directories, can 
manage hard disks up to 512 megabytes, numerous enhancements to DOS commands. 
</P>
<P>
Requirements: IBM or compatible PC.

KEATING ASKS STATE HIGH COURT TO REDUCE BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From his Los Angeles jail cell, Charles H. Keating Jr. has gone right to the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, attorneys for Keating appealed to the state Supreme Court to lift 
or reduce the $5-million bail that is keeping the once-wealthy executive behind 
bars pending a trial on 42 counts of securities fraud and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, former chairman of American Continental Corp., the parent company of 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, argues that the bail is excessive and punitive. As 
such, it violates the state and federal constitutions by exacting cruel and 
unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
It is unknown how quickly the state's high court will act on the petition, 
technically a writ of habeas corpus. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal to the Supreme Court came a day after a three-judge state Court of 
Appeal panel unanimously rejected Keating's petition to lower his bail Tuesday. 
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner set bail at $5 million on Sept. 18 and 
refused to lower it in a subsequent hearing because of the seriousness of the 
charges and the risk of Keating fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and three associates were charged with wrongdoing in selling more than 
$200 million in American Continental bonds to more than 17,000 investors 
through Lincoln branches. Most of the investors were elderly Southland 
residents who said they thought the bonds were insured. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds became nearly worthless when American Continental filed for 
bankruptcy in April, 1989. The next day, federal regulators seized Lincoln. The 
thrift's failure is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged securities violations listed in an indictment unsealed last week in 
Los Angeles Superior Court carry a maximum 10-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's petition to the Supreme Court argues that the case against him cannot 
be distinguished from the charges against his co-defendants and that he cannot 
pay the high bail. Klausner initially set bail for the other defendants at $1 
million, but later reduced it and they have been released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony last week showed that while he had a net worth of nearly $40 million 
three years ago, his debts now exceed his assets by more than $5 million. 
Thrift regulators and prosecutors doubt Keating's pauper status, though they 
admit they have no evidence to dispute it. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court petition also states that Keating's six children have offered 
to pledge their homes as collateral if the court reduces the bail to a figure 
they could meet -- about $500,000, according to previous testimony. That should 
keep Keating from fleeing, the petition contends. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the papers point out, Keating has shown that he is not a flight risk 
because he has appeared in more than two dozen civil cases filed against him 
and appeared in Superior Court last week after knowing for five days that he 
had been indicted.

CHAMBER'S NEW VIDEO LIBRARY FOR OWNERS MAKES ITS DEBUT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Greater Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday opened Orange County's 
first video library for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Business Media Center contains a series of 30-minute videos, developed by 
the chamber and Pacific Bell, that provide small business owners tips on 
financing, marketing and management. 
</P>
<P>
The initial videos are in English but videos dubbed in Spanish, Vietnamese and 
Cambodian will be available soon, said Michael Metzler, the chamber's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The library is the brainchild of insurance agent Paul Park, a chamber member, 
and is open to members only. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a prototype model for other chambers of commerce in the nation to 
follow," Park said. "This will provide business owners the necessary 
information to run their companies efficiently by using local businessmen to 
discuss local business problems." 
</P>
<P>
Comcast Cable TV (Channels 3 and 26) in Santa Ana agreed to air some of the 
videos in October, Metzler said.

REPAY $6 MILLION OR GO TO JAIL, JUDGE TELLS ADVISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge said he would jail financial adviser and radio personality 
Richard (R.G.) Reynolds of Laguna Niguel unless he meets an Oct. 15 deadline to 
repay about $6 million he owes to victims of his various investment schemes. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, U.S. District Judge A. Andrew Hauk found Reynolds guilty of 
violating civil securities laws for enticing about 400 people to invest in Kern 
County gold and other ventures. Hauk subsequently ruled Reynolds in contempt of 
court for failing to repay any of the money. On Wednesday, Hauk issued the 
order with the Oct. 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the judge did the appropriate thing," said Sandra Harris, chief of 
enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission's Los Angeles region. 
"Mr. Reynolds had ample opportunity to present evidence demonstrating his 
inability to comply with the court's order to pay, and he failed to do so." 
</P>
<P>
In his heyday, between 1985 and 1987, Reynolds had a substantial following in 
California and the West through his nightly radio talk shows on investing. 
Reynolds, who has only a high school education, portrayed himself as a folksy 
adviser to plain folks with modest amounts to invest. Until a few weeks ago, 
his program was airing on radio station KORG-AM in Anaheim. For that show, like 
his others, he paid for the air time. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said many investors were elderly people who gave Reynolds their 
retirement money. The SEC said Reynolds commingled the funds he collected from 
investors and spent them on himself and on other business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Reynolds said he is broke. He filed for personal bankruptcy in 
Santa Ana federal court on April 18 to protect his Laguna Niguel home. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to go to jail, I'll go," said Reynolds, who said he plans to appeal 
Hauk's order to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. "I would have run a long time ago if I was 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds has acknowledged in court that he is the target of a Los Angeles 
federal grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not have the $6 million the court wants because he spent all 
the money on salaries, newsletters and other expenses needed to operate 
Burbank-based R.G. Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole thing was to build a corporation and take it public," said Reynolds. 
He closed the business shortly after U.S. Postal Inspectors, acting on a 
federal search warrant, raided his offices in April, 1987, seizing business 
records, stock certificates and rare coins. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Reynolds said he had purchased controlling interest in Flow 
Ventures Ltd., a holding company with interests in a Tennessee tomato juice 
factory and a California cosmetics firm. Flow Ventures stock is traded in the 
pink sheets and has been trading for less than 20 cents a share in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SEC's Harris said the agency's goal is to collect the money 
Reynolds took in and return it to the bilked investors. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' personal bankruptcy petition lists debts of $500,000. He asks that 
$1.8 million worth of property, including his $750,000 home, be exempt from the 
filing. The petition also says he holds 37 million shares of Flow Ventures 
stock, valued at $740,000. According to the petition, Reynolds lent the company 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Before the bankruptcy filing, First Fidelity Savings &amp; Loan began 
foreclosure proceedings against Reynolds' home. In late August, Household 
Finance filed a motion for relief from the exemption so it could proceed with 
foreclosure on a separate $100,000 note secured by his home.

CHEERLEADING -- '90S STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL: SQUADS, ONCE MADE UP OF A FEW OF THE MOST POPULAR GIRLS ON CAMPUS, 
HAVE GROWN TO 30 OR 40 KIDS WITH REAL ATHLETIC ABILITY. BUT THE SKYROCKETING 
COSTS OF UNIFORMS, TRAINING, TRAVEL AND COMPETITIONS STILL PUT THE ACTIVITY OUT 
OF REACH FOR SOME LOWER-INCOME STUDENTS. 
</P>

<P>
Back in the good ol' days, high school cheerleading was a rather quaint 
endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
First, a few dozen gutsy girls would take turns shaking their pompons before a 
jury of their peers. Then the student body would cast its predictable vote for 
the eight most popular girls, regardless of ability. 
</P>
<P>
The envied eight would show up at every football and basketball game decked in 
the same plaid skirts, initialed sweaters and saddle Oxfords. They would yell, 
"Push 'em back," do some cartwheels and build a pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
Nary a cheerleader came near a swim or track meet, unless her boyfriend was on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
That was then. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the art of cheerleading has vaulted to greater heights. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Orange County public schools use outside judges to make cheerleader 
selections, which are based entirely on talent. Thirty or 40, rather than six 
or eight, cheerleaders comprise the squads so that every athletic event -- from 
wrestling to girls' soccer -- can be supported. 
</P>
<P>
Squads hire special coaches, and even choreographers, to teach elaborate dance 
steps and acrobatics. Cheerleaders strut their hard-earned showmanship on 
television at national competitions. 
</P>
<P>
And -- an outgrowth of all this new-found regality -- the cost of cheerleading 
has jumped skyward. 
</P>
<P>
Uniforms alone average around $700 in Orange County -- and that total doesn't 
include all the accessories, such as megaphones, shoes, jackets. Add $200 more 
for cheerleading camp, then an additional $200 for miscellaneous purchases -- 
cookies and carnations for the football players, crepe paper for streamers, 
poster board for signs. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, cheerleaders buy into a thousand-dollar extracurricular 
activity that -- unlike the sporting events they rally behind -- is not funded 
by local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard the amount, I thought, 'Oh, my gosh, where am I going to 
get that much money?' " recalled Mary Wille, whose daughter Dina DiFabio is a 
cheerleader at Valencia High School in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
Wille was a divorced mother on a tight budget when Dina announced her 
intentions to try out for cheerleader four years ago. The high school freshman 
brought home release papers for Wille to sign warning parents of the expense. 
</P>
<P>
"This was before Dina was old enough to get a job, so it was a bit of a 
struggle," said Wille, a hospital social worker. 
</P>
<P>
Now a 17-year-old senior, Dina waits tables so that she can split cheerleading 
costs three ways with her mother and father. "This kid's no slouch -- she takes 
responsibility," said Wille, who recently remarried. "I don't know how some 
single mothers do it." 
</P>
<P>
Only a young person could maintain Dina's schedule -- which balances school, 
studying, cheer practice, a three-day-a-week job and games. "I thought about 
dropping out of cheerleading this year," she admitted. "Sometimes I get 
frustrated and I think, 'If I quit, I could have so much more money.' But I 
know I'd miss it." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Dina, her high school recycles uniform pieces, saving repeat 
cheerleaders about $200. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my girls that they have to use at least two of the same pieces from the 
previous year," said Valencia High pepster adviser Jonna Robinson. "We don't 
change our uniforms' style every year. The crowd doesn't notice if you have two 
stripes or three on your skirt." 
</P>
<P>
Most Orange County schools start from scratch each fall -- partly because the 
uniforms endure a lot of mileage over the year, and partly because cheerleader 
championships have made appearance all the more important. 
</P>
<P>
"We get new uniforms every year because we want to look our best for the 
competitions," said Judy Trujillo, pepster adviser at Los Alamitos High. "I 
hate spending that much money, but then again, the (cheerleading) wardrobe gets 
worn a lot. And it cuts down on the number of school clothes the kids need." 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, cheerleadering attire would not be referred to as a 
"wardrobe." But now it's just that: a football uniform, a basketball uniform, a 
day uniform, a night uniform, a camp uniform. "My sweater this year cost $183," 
said Los Alamitos High cheerleader Thomas Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Pailes, whose daughter Brandy is entering her fourth year as a 
cheerleader at Marina High in Huntington Beach, said: "I've never sat down and 
totaled what we've spent on uniforms. I don't think I will -- I'm afraid I'd go 
into shock. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I have not encouraged our 11-year-old daughter to be a 
cheerleader," Pailes added, half-seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Spiraling uniform costs provoked the Orange Unified School Board last spring to 
impose an annual ceiling of $600 per wardrobe. "My concern is that the expense 
has reached a point where it has become prohibitive for some children to 
participate in cheerleading," said school board member Russ Barrios. 
</P>
<P>
While most public school sports are covered by district funds, virtually all 
cheerleading expenditures are the responsibility of students and their parents. 
"Should cheerleader outfits be paid for by taxpayer money?" Barrios wondered. 
"That's a good consideration, but I'm not advocating it, because I have no idea 
where we would get the money." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joanna Marconi, pepster adviser at Tustin High: "I definitely think it's 
unfair -- every sport on campus gets their uniforms paid for, but cheerleading 
is still not considered a sport. " 
</P>
<P>
Most athletic uniforms, she conceded, are three-sizes-fit-all and never go out 
of style. Since they can be passed down easily, they are a more feasible 
expense than custom-made cheerleading uniforms. "You couldn't find a different 
set of girls to fit the same set of uniforms year after year," Marconi 
observed. 
</P>
<P>
Public schools already must scrape by on limited resources, without the burden 
of costly cheerleading outfits. "I would have trouble justifying funding 
cheerleaders when we have had to cut back on special classes for 
Spanish-speaking students," said Peggy Kaytis, pep squad adviser at Orange 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Still, advisers worry that the system, as is, might deter many students from 
cheerleading. "I think we would have a better turnout of girls trying out if 
the cost wasn't so high," Marconi said. "Not even 100 people tried out this 
year, and we have more than 2,000 students (at Tustin High)." 
</P>
<P>
High school officials claim that, when necessary, they can find a way to aid 
cheerleaders who are from low-income families. "We have a booster club, and we 
have fund-raisers such as car washes," said Teri Bailey, pepster adviser at 
Esperanzo High in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's embarrassing to a teen-ager to ask for financial help -- don't you 
think?" she mused. "It's too bad, because we would keep the request private. 
But teen-agers are proud." 
</P>
<P>
Out-of-state competitions can drive up the price tag even further. Most high 
school squads, however, make participation optional on an individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to save $700 for the (upcoming) championship in Florida," said 
cheerleader Schwartz, who works 25 hours a week at a video store. 
</P>
<P>
Cheerleading's metamorphosis into a competitive sport has been a boon for 
participants, despite the additional cost, Kaytis noted. "They spend all their 
time supporting other athletes; so little of what they do is for themselves," 
she said. "Championships give them a chance to show off what they've learned." 
</P>
<P>
Rey Lozano, cheerleading coach/choreographer at Los Alamitos High, attributed 
his specialty's new professionalism to television. 
</P>
<P>
"The dance and gymnastic movements we see on TV have been incorporated into 
cheerleading," said Lozano, a former trainer for the Los Angeles Rams 
cheerleaders. "Everyone has watched the gymnasts perform during the Olympics. 
Everyone has seen videos of Michael Jackson and Paula Abdul." 
</P>
<P>
As cheerleading developed into an athletic sport in its own right, tryouts 
became serious business. No longer is popularity the only requirement -- or, 
for that matter, a requirement at all. 
</P>
<P>
School advisers concurred that the modern method of allowing objective judges 
to choose cheerleaders is a fairer approach than polling students. 
</P>
<P>
"I was new in school when I tried out at Tustin High in '79," said Marconi, who 
has returned to her alma mater. "I was a talented gymnast, but because nobody 
knew me, I didn't make it. I thought it was silly -- you wouldn't choose your 
football team by student vote." 
</P>
<P>
The unbiased selection process may indeed result in an adept squad, but the 
downside, Marconi said, is that "cheerleading has lost some of its aura." 
</P>
<P>
Kaytis of Orange High agreed. "I can remember when cheerleading was the 
absolute pinnacle, but it doesn't carry that same prestige anymore," she said. 
"I think deep in their hearts all girls still want to be cheerleaders, but 
today there's this outward attitude of 'no big deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
High school students, Kaytis believes, have become less class-conscious in 
general since her cheerleading days at Anaheim's Loara High 25 years ago. 
"We're a much more egalitarian society," she said. "Back then, there was a 
definite pecking order that we didn't resent or give much thought to. We just 
accepted that the cheerleaders were only for football and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the students expect them to come out and support all the athletes. The 
cheerleaders even go out and put banners up for tennis games. It's an 
interesting change; I think it's neat. I just wish the students would realize 
how hard these cheerleaders work. They have to attend a minimum of three events 
a week." 
</P>
<P>
Even though cheerleading tryouts are no longer a popularity pageant, the most 
esteemed girls often still manage to make the squad, Valencia High's Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem fair, does it?" she laughed. "As if being popular wasn't 
enough, they're also good athletes." 
</P>

GOURMANDS NOT AFRAID TO LEI IT ON THICK AT LUAU IN LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget about plastic leis, mai tais in paper cups, and slabs of pork -- the 
usual scene at luaus on this side of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
For members of the Laguna Niguel chapter of Chaine des Rotisseurs -- an 
international society devoted to the joy of savoring fine food and wine -- it 
was a necklace of orchids, mai tais in shaved coconuts, and dainty servings of 
squab at Hotel Laguna on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, guests -- including Hotel Laguna owner Claes Andersen and his 
wife, Georgia -- nibbled on salmon rolls, mushroom caps stuffed with shrimp 
mousse, and scallops. After guests watched a golden sun drown in an opalescent 
sea, they gathered at the hotel's central patio, complete with gushing fountain 
and palm-smothered gazebo (which housed a dreamy-sounding Hawaiian band). Here, 
they dug into a feast so elegant that they began to speak in hushed tones. 
Nobody wanted to distract from the perfection of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Up for savoring: camphor-wood barbecued squab and white miso soup accompanied 
by a William Hill Reserve '88 (Take notes -- this group knows its wines); lamb 
steak with pine nuts offered with a Clos de Bois, Marlstone '86; spinach 
cucumber salad with selected caviars served up with Clos de la Roche '83; and 
almond mousse in a Florentine cookie basket presented with Penfolds Grandfather 
Port or a Late Harvest '85 Riesling by Kendall Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests was Ritz-Carlton general manager Henry Schielein and his wife, 
Carol. Henry is the president of the Laguna Niguel chapter of the illustrious 
group that regularly meets to lap up the good life. How does one become a 
member? "They have to be referred," said Schielein, decked out in Hawaiian duds 
and his wife's lei. "Then we invite them to a dinner or two to see if they fit 
in." (Make that behave. Members must not be given to drunkenness and must know 
how to carry on a polite dinner conversation. Political debates are banned.) 
</P>
<P>
If Rotisseur-wanna-bes pass muster, they get to take regular flights of 
culinary fancy with some of Orange County's most discriminating gourmands. And 
occasionally, they get the chance to rankle one another. For example, 
Andersen's luau invitation referred to something guests might be able to spot 
"to the south" as they sipped their libations on Hotel Laguna's beachside 
terrace: "the PuPu Ritz -- an extinct volcano!" (the drop-dead gorgeous 
Ritz-Carlton, but of course). 
</P>
<P>
Perspectives: While Hotel Laguna was brimming with the style of the South Seas, 
a nearby cottage bustled with the style of Scandinavia on Sunday. Bill Magnuson 
and Ulf Strandberg, proprietors of the Gustaf Anders restaurant at South Coast 
Plaza Village, staged an intimate dinner for supporters of the Laguna Art 
Museum in their cliff-side home with an ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
Up for sampling on their balcony: salmon, golden caviar, pickled herring, 
Scandinavian breads and cheeses. Afterward, guests filed into the back yard for 
a sit-down dinner that featured a first course of fish soup (the smell of it 
simmering was reason enough to come to this party) and a main course of smoked 
reindeer. Smoked reindeer? "It's a delicacy," Strandberg said with a smile as 
he tumbled the shrimp shells in his soup. "We get it from Scandinavia via San 
Francisco." (Said one giggling guest: "Thank God it's not Christmas!") 
</P>
<P>
Among guests: John and Teri Kennady (elegant in a white blazer hand-painted in 
silver); Robert and Nadine Hall (in a stunning turquoise cashmere blazer); Tim 
and Debi Bremner; Dr. Signe Belden; Robert Ehrlich; Dr. Robert Ball; Carl and 
Beverly Mitchell; Virginia Snyder; and Kitty Morgan with her husband, Charles 
Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum. (Desmarais was in the pink about 
the museum being in the black.) The evening was part of the museum's 
"Perspectives" fund-raising party series. 
</P>
<P>
Capers: Neiman Marcus at Fashion Island staged its sixth annual "Catalogue 
Caper" on Saturday night, netting more than $100,000 for the Orange County 
chapter of the American Diabetes Assn. Leba Kramer was chairwoman of the 
$175-per-person affair.

HOW TO: NEUTRALIZE MOVIE THEATER LOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALLAS M. JACKSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wonder if Siskel and Ebert ever have these problems? 
</P>
<P>
You've hired a baby-sitter, had an enjoyable, leisurely dinner, paid for 
parking, tickets, popcorn and sodas and are now kicked back watching the 
feature film. As if on cue, the people behind turn into Andrew Dice Clay 
clones. 
</P>
<P>
They talk, they giggle, they laugh at the romantic parts, make kissing sounds 
during the tender scenes, and they give away plot points at the most 
suspenseful moments. They put their feet on the back of the seat next to you, 
inches from your face, or they sit under the no-smoking signs, casually puffing 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Recently in San Bernardino County, a judge who was trying to watch "Pretty 
Woman" in peace was incessantly disturbed by a couple of overactive teen-agers 
who just wouldn't be quiet. Having reached his breaking point, the 69-year-old 
justice smacked one of the boys in the face and choked the other. 
</P>
<P>
"That's certainly not recommended," said Michael Tieger, general manager of the 
AMC Orange Mall 6 theaters. But short of facing possible misdemeanor battery 
charges, what's the best way to deal with discourteous patrons? How do you get 
people in a movie theater to behave without leaving a mark? 
</P>
<P>
Moviegoers have a few options: 
</P>
<P>
* Firmly and politely tell the offending party they are disturbing you. 
</P>
<P>
* Change your seat. 
</P>
<P>
* Inform the manager. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask for a refund and leave the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tough situation. We want all of our patrons to know they're in a 
comfortable, safe atmosphere when they go to the movies. It disturbs me when 
patrons have to get out of their seat and come get us, but what seems to work 
for us is proactive management," Tieger said. 
</P>
<P>
"Proactive management" is cinematic jargon for how theater managers get people 
to comply with standards of common courtesy. The following are some of Tieger's 
suggestions as to how managers can either avoid an incident or effectively 
handle it once patrons have alerted them to a problem. 
</P>
<P>
* Conduct auditorium walk-throughs and check not only the quality of the 
picture and the temperature of the theater, but look for people talking, 
smoking or with their feet on the seats. 
</P>
<P>
* Politely and firmly tell loud talkers and other potential troublemakers they 
are disturbing the people around them. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask smokers to go outside or into the lobby to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask smokers to surrender their cigarette so it can be extinguished for them 
in an ashtray. This usually stops startled smokers from just putting the 
cigarette out on the floor and creating a possible fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
* In a worst-case scenario, managers can ask truly obnoxious offenders to 
leave. DALLAS M. JACKSON

HIGHLIFE / A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
VIDEO KID IS TAPING HIS WAY TO THE TOP; 
</P>
<P>
HOBBY: AT 15, DAVID SMITH ALREADY SHOWS PROMISE OF BUILDING A CAREER IN TV 
PRODUCTION. HIS ENTHUSIASM IS PAYING OFF IN EMPLOYMENT AND RECOGNITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRISHA GINSBERG, Trisha Ginsburg is a sophomore at Los Alamitos High School, 
where she is entertainment editor of the school newspaper and an active member 
of many clubs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture this. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't, you can bet David Smith can. 
</P>
<P>
David is what you might call a videophile. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, I have been into gadgets and 
electronics," he said. "I got started with the audio end of it, and that 
naturally progressed into video." 
</P>
<P>
David had the curiosity and ambition to learn, but until last year, no formal 
training. Through a friend, he learned of a class in video production offered 
by the Regional Occupation Program of North Orange County. What neither David 
nor his friend knew, however, was that students needed to be at least 16 to 
enroll in the class. 
</P>
<P>
"It took them two weeks before they found out about my age," said David, who is 
just now 15 and a sophomore at Los Alamitos High School. "By that time, I was 
already established in the class. So, technically, I'm not in ROP. I basically 
attend the class and have all the privileges of everyone in the class; I just 
don't get credit for attending." 
</P>
<P>
The ROP class operates after school at the Los Alamitos Television studio on 
the campus of Los Alamitos High, although it is independent from the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We are an independent agency, a nonprofit organization that is funded by the 
city. We just happen to rent on the campus," David said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being the site of ROP classes, LATV is a community-access 
station that broadcasts on Los Alamitos-Rossmore Cable. 
</P>
<P>
Suzan Grab, who worked in commercial TV in Boston, has taught the ROP video 
production class at LATV for about a year. She praises David. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very easy to work with," she said. "I think he's very talented, and he 
shows a great deal of promise in video production." 
</P>
<P>
Grab believes in letting her students get involved in their educations. 
</P>
<P>
"I take a hands-off approach to teaching, because I want the student to get 
hands-on training," she said. 
</P>
<P>
David said he was amazed at the way the class was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day of class -- they'd never seen me before -- they slapped a 
camcorder in my hands and told me to go out in the community and tape some 
Christmas scenes. A week later, we had produced a Christmas video that was 
airing on LATV. That blew my mind. I had been there a half an hour, and they 
threw a $3,000 camera in my hands and said, 'Go out with this and have fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
Once David had sufficient training, he started a project that had been on his 
mind for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an idea for a production for my dad. He had these books of Vietnam 
pictures that were really good. So, I had this idea of putting those pictures 
to song, creating a musical montage." 
</P>
<P>
He began the tedious process of making his video, "Vietnam," in early December, 
1989, hoping to finish it in time to give to his father, Bob, as a Christmas 
present. 
</P>
<P>
"First, I went through and listened to the song (Billy Joel's 'Good Night, 
Saigon') with my stopwatch and wrote down all of the lyrics, timing it all out. 
I then went through the books (selecting photographs). This took 2 1/2 weeks. 
The editing process took nine hours, and the entire production lasts 6 minutes 
51 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
"Awesome," said Bob Smith, a Vietnam veteran, of his son's video. "I sat there 
watching it with my mouth hanging open. I didn't realize he had the capability 
or equipment to do it. I'm proud of it and proud of him. It carried quite an 
impact for me." 
</P>
<P>
After the video had been shown by LATV, it was eligible for a number of 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
"I entered mine in the California Media Library Educators Assn. awards, which 
is a statewide competition," David said. "I tied for fourth in the category of 
Musical Montage. I also entered it in the local Audio/Visual Arts Festival and 
tied for third." 
</P>
<P>
LATV entered "Vietnam" in the annual Hometown, U.S.A. Video Awards, which is 
sponsored by the Hometown Video Assn., a nationwide association for community 
access channels. It received an honorable mention, competing against 2,000 
entries from 41 states. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big honor," David said, "and all off of my first production. It's 
hard because now I've got to live up to it." 
</P>
<P>
David has since completed a number of videos, including one of O. Henry's 
"Hearts and Hands," and he is currently working on another titled "Mama," 
which, he said, is based on one of his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
David, who was spending four to five hours a day at LATV, was recently hired by 
the station. "They're paying me now to broadcast," he said. "I put the shows on 
the air, kind of like a video disc jockey." 
</P>
<P>
David, along with his brother Gregg and uncle Max Kamakani, is also starting a 
business called Nu-Mo Technic Video Productions. "It's a video production 
service where we will videotape anything," David said. "It's a learning 
experience for us." 
</P>
<P>
David's hectic schedule, which includes school, cross-country practice and his 
time at LATV, means sticking to a demanding timetable. 
</P>
<P>
"Scheduling my time last year was my shortcoming," he said. "At one point, I 
let myself slip for about a two-week period. I said, 'OK, I'm going to do 
video. And that's all I'm going to do.' And for that period of time, my grades 
just went downhill. I finally managed to pull myself out of it and budget my 
time better." 
</P>
<P>
As for long-term goals, David doesn't hesitate to say he would like a career in 
video production. 
</P>
<P>
"Who wouldn't like to? I mean, sure, I'd love to go on and win Oscars and Emmys 
and whatever else there may be. That would be great," he said. "If I can get a 
monetary gain from doing what I love to do, then great. If not, then, hey, I've 
got a great hobby and I can do something else for a living."

JAZZ SINGER HAILS FROM COUNTRY ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
PROFILE: DESPITE HER DEVOTED JAZZ-BLUES FOLLOWING, MAXINE WELDON SAYS, "MY 
BASIC FEELING IS COUNTRY-WESTERN," WHICH SHE LEARNED TO LOVE FROM HER FATHER. 
SHE'S IN LAGUNA NIGUEL TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's 10 p.m. on a Friday night at Marla's Memory Lane in Los Angeles, and the 
crowd is getting impatient. It has heard a nifty five-piece band, led by 
trumpeter Bobby Rodriguez, blow through a couple of standards, and it listened 
while veteran comedian Renaldo Rey jabbered away on an assortment of colorful 
topics ("What are those blues singers talking about? Drink muddy water? Sleep 
in a hollow log? You'd have to be nuts!"). 
</P>
<P>
But then the band strikes up again, and suddenly Maxine Weldon is there, 
singing in hard, clear tones, swaying to a rocking-chair rhythm while her voice 
slides from a conspiratorial whisper into a full-blown cry. 
</P>
<P>
Her delivery is so genuine that members of the audience feel compelled to 
respond, offering encouragement, or nodding their heads and saying, "That's 
exactly how it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Weldon, who appears tonight at Laguna Niguel's Design Center South, offers the 
crowd some blues, jazz standards ("My Romance," "When I Fall in Love"), and an 
original entitled "Lend Me Your Life." She even does a country tune, Gary 
Stewart's "You're Place or Mine." But with a jazz quintet providing the 
instrumentals, the song's roots are hardly identifiable, even though her 
phrasing, as it is on almost every number, has that in-the-saddle, C &amp; W 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
"My basic feeling is country-Western," the singer said recently from her home 
in Beverly Hills. "A lot of the songs I do in my show are country-Western. They 
may not sound like country-Western songs because we're doing it without the 
guitar and we're doing it a little up, at a little faster tempo." 
</P>
<P>
The singer, born in Holdenville, Okla., and reared in Bakersfield, credits her 
father for childhood exposure to country. "My father loved country and Western, 
he was a great fan of Red Foley and Roy Acuff. I was, too, and I still enjoy 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the fact that her father taught music and that she "was always 
involved in some music program or another," the kinds of music she heard at 
home were limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't listen to jazz and blues around the house at all because my 
parents were very religious. It was considered sinful to listen to it, that it 
was the devil's music. So the music that we could hear was picked for us. But 
we'd get out to hear other music; you know, go next door to a friend's house 
and hear whatever was going on at the time. Mainly it was Fats Domino, Ray 
Charles, the Platters, the Coasters." 
</P>
<P>
Weldon began her singing career after moving to Hawaii in 1959. It was there 
that she had a chance to work with respected vocalist Helen Humes. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot of stage presence from her, which helped me to become a 
performer," Weldon said. "I was really young, about 18, when I worked with her, 
and she gave me a lot of direction." 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, the singer began a five-year stay in Japan, appearing at clubs and 
concerts in Tokyo as well as in Formosa, Korea, Thailand and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
It was during this time that she met and performed on bills with fellow 
Americans Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole. But not all her 
engagements were so glamorous. "I worked a lot of clubs that had no English 
bookings at all so I had to learn to speak Japanese. It was quite an experience 
being a black woman living in Japan. I'm not surprised about what's happening 
there now because it was happening there then. It was very future-conscious and 
I was lucky to be a part of it. 
</P>

Back in the States in 1966, Weldon began making club appearances in Los Angeles 
and hit the TV circuit. She released a number of small-company albums in the 
1970s, but, despite one single for Columbia in 1975, she's never had a 
major-label album contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of difficulty with my kind of music at the time. They didn't 
really want to hear a black woman record country-Western music. I got a lot of 
negative feedback for that." 
</P>
<P>
But Weldon is confident that things will turn her way. 
</P>
<P>
"(Record companies) are a little more liberal now than before. Before they 
wanted you to sound like Aretha Franklin or Nancy Wilson. Well, I don't have 
that kind of sound, I don't sing like anybody else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For her Design Center South appearance, Weldon will be backed by her usual 
band, which is led by trumpeter Rodriguez and includes saxophonist Louis 
Taylor, pianist Phil Wright, bassist Ricky Taylor and drummer Washington 
Rucker. 
</P>
<P>
While most singers prefer the quieter support of piano or a bass-piano duo, 
Weldon prefers a bigger challenge. "I like the big-band sound. I like working 
with horns, because I have a strong voice." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks the kind of music being written today is cause for optimism. 
"They're bringing romance back to music now. Before, the men were putting down 
women and the women were putting down the men. But now it's all about love and 
dancing close and looking together at the sunset. And I like that romantic kind 
of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxine Weldon appears tonight at Design Center South, 23811 Aliso Creek Road, 
Laguna Niguel, 8 p.m. Information: (714) 643-2929.

RECURRING ROLE MOVES ACTOR FROM PLACENTIA INTO 'A DIFFERENT WORLD'

Andrew Lowery of Placentia hopes that a new, recurring role he begins playing 
tonight on the NBC comedy series "A Different World" will bring fun, fortune 
and a chance to beat fellow cast member Kadeem Hardison in one-on-one 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"Kadeem is a nice guy and a good performer," says Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
"But he plays truly mean hoop." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery will play Matthew, a cousin of free-spirited Freddie (Cree Williams). 
Matthew "is a lot like me," he says. "Kind of goofy. Since Cree and I have the 
same sense of humor, we don't really have to prepare anything. We just kind of 
take off on each other." 
</P>
<P>
He says he landed the role on "A Different World" after "one of the simplest 
auditions I've ever done: The casting director knew me from another show she'd 
done, and when she called me in to talk about this role, she just said, 'This 
is you.' Then the producers and (director) Debbie Allen looked at me and that 
was it. 
</P>
<P>
"From the first day (on the set), the cast kind of fell into chemistry. It's a 
very busy, noisy show (so) I fit right in. And they laugh at my stupid jokes." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lowery, who is in his early 20s, has numerous television appearances 
to his credit, including a prominent role in the Emmy-nominated miniseries 
"Family of Spies," "A Different World" will provide him with his first regular 
paychecks as an actor. 
</P>
<P>
He has signed a five-year contract and will be seen in seven episodes this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Different World" airs tonight at 8:30 p.m. on NBC.

COLLECTIONS: BANK'S CULTURAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR CRINGES AT ART THAT MERELY

When Tressa Miller hung a group of what she calls "evocatively erotic" photo 
collages by Robert Heineken in offices at Security Pacific Bank's San Francisco 
headquarters, reaction was swift and stern. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, an employee called to complain, saying that co-workers on her 
floor viewed the images -- superimposed ads and editorial material from Vogue 
magazine -- as demeaning to women. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, the bank's vivacious 48-year-old first vice president and director of 
cultural affairs, sent back a memo explaining that Heineken's point was to show 
how women are routinely manipulated by the media. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the memo found its way to every floor of the building, and people 
came in droves to see the works. 
</P>
<P>
But -- as Miller recounted the story Monday as part of an Art Forum lecture at 
Rancho Santiago College -- the women whose offices were on that floor noted 
that they dealt mainly with small business clients who didn't understand work 
of that nature, and it was tedious to constantly be explaining the art to them. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Miller -- who described her position as "a translator of what 
artists are doing today to the lay world" -- took the works down. 
</P>
<P>
Art hung in offices "can't be very threatening," she said. "There are all kinds 
of people in the workplace. . . . At home they could walk away or put (the art) 
in a different place. But at work, they are forced to confront it on a 
day-to-day basis." 
</P>
<P>
Her goal is to get people to "accept as much contemporary art as they can 
(without becoming) so confrontational I can't get people to live with it. You 
don't want pabulum or decoration -- but a lot of it is decorative." 
</P>
<P>
There are guidelines in a corporate setting. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the 12,000-piece Security Pacific collection does not include art 
with frontal nudity. On the other hand, Miller said, "lifestyles have changed. 
There was a time I was told 'absolutely no nudes.' But we keep pushing a little 
bit more." 
</P>
<P>
Teasingly asked if the collection includes any works by Robert Mapplethorpe, 
the controversial photographer of homoerotic images, Miller said it did. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a calla lily photograph. With any artist's work, you can find significant 
work that can give an idea of what the artist's work is about without 
(involving) more confrontational images. The lilies are sensual, they are 
erotic, but they don't hit you on the head." 
</P>
<P>
The Security Pacific collection, installed in the bank's offices worldwide, is 
separate from its gallery program, which Miller also administers. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1975 in the Los Angeles office as a public relations effort to bring 
potential clients to downtown Los Angeles, the gallery program has expanded to 
Costa Mesa, Phoenix and (opening this fall) San Francisco and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Each in-house gallery displays several thematic exhibitions of contemporary art 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
"How do the exhibitions relate to the collection?" Miller asked. "There is an 
enormous impact. Through the exhibitions, (employees) are willing to look at 
the art in their own office spaces in a different way. (The exhibitions) are 
very instrumental as an educational tool."

POP BEAT: WELCOME BACK, SEBASTIAN! BRILLIANCE HASN'T FADED

<P>
In the mid-'60s, John Sebastian was one of a very select group of songwriters 
-- including also John Lennon, Ray Davies and Brian Wilson -- for whom the term 
genius didn't seem just a publicist's wild notion. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the brilliant, still-evocative "Do You Believe in Magic," his 
Lovin' Spoonful racked up seven consecutive Top 10 hits, including the No. 1 
"Summer in the City." 
</P>
<P>
That 1966 song was at the forefront of the extra-musical sound collages the 
Beatles and others soon adopted, creating a sound poem of car horns and 
jackhammers. And the Spoonful whipped through that recording in a mere two 
evenings. 
</P>
<P>
"Ease" seemed to be one of Sebastian's magical properties. Even with such 
weighty projects as being one of the first rock composers to score films -- 
working with both Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen -- Sebastian and his 
band generated a wistful, good-timey mood. There was humor, poetry and 
exhilaration to their work, qualities Sebastian retained when he went solo and 
delivered one of the most endearing performances at Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
If Sebastian is no longer looking out from the stage at hundreds of thousands 
of listeners, his audiences may have likewise diminished expectations of him. 
Aside from his 1976 "Welcome Back" theme to the TV series "Welcome Back, 
Kotter" scarcely a murmur has been heard from Sebastian, prompting the standard 
rumors that he was perhaps "not all there" any longer. 
</P>
<P>
But the veteran singer was most certainly in command of his faculties at his 
Peppers Golden Bear performance Tuesday. And though the stakes are surely 
lowered, there was still a quiet brilliance to his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, looking younger than he did 15 years ago, Sebastian told the audience, 
"This is sort of a rejuvenating experience for me because I've played the 
Golden Bear now for three decades . . . and it's real cute now." 
</P>
<P>
Though the bulk of his set dealt with evoking his '60s Greenwich Village days, 
he did so with a freshness and a Cosby-esque humor that suggested a Sebastian 
autobiography would be a wonderful document. 
</P>
<P>
He sang his classic tunes "Rain on the Roof," "She's a Lady," "Daydream," 
"Younger Generation" and others. 
</P>
<P>
Though his voice sounded strained at times, he still conveyed the songs' joyous 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed between the songs were his recollections, including some about the 
old Golden Bear. 
</P>
<P>
The Spoonful's first performance there in 1965 stuck in the band members' 
minds, he said, because in New York, they were accustomed to playing for "guys 
with beards and turtleneck sweaters and the occasional girl with ironed hair. 
Suddenly here we were a 'pop group' with girls following our car. We didn't 
have that Mark Lindsay appeal before." 
</P>
<P>
He also painted verbal portraits of bluesmen Lightnin' Hopkins and Mississippi 
John Hurt ("He was kind of like having a black Yoda around," Sebastian said) -- 
followed by excellent evocations of Hopkins' "Shining Moon" and Hurt's "Coffee 
Blues." 
</P>
<P>
There were only a couple of new Sebastian songs in the set. "Just Another Link 
in the Chain" -- on which he accompanied himself on a resonant electric 
baritone guitar -- was a playful ode to genetics. "Night Owl Cafe" was a 
melancholy stroll through the now-closed Village nightspot where the Spoonful 
and other artists forged their sound. 
</P>
<P>
Sebastian said he's shopping for a label for a new album, and it seems well 
worth looking forward to, if these songs are any indication. As splendid a 
musical historian as Sebastian is, his gift is too great to go without new 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Opener Shawn Phillips did offer signs of growth and change in his 80-minute 
set, and offered evidence that not all change is necessarily good. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the sonorous om-chant ruminations that made him a minor cult figure 
back in the hippie days, Phillips showcased his move into the classical genre. 
This consisted chiefly of tapping the mouse on his onstage Macintosh computer 
and making conducting motions as the computer spewed out sub-Synergy-grade 
syntho-classical blather with such titles as "Variations in D, Parts 1 and 2." 
</P>
<P>
Peppers Golden Bear still doesn't have its act completely together in 
presenting these quieter shows. Tuesday the music had to compete with the 
club's loud overhead stage-light-cooling fans and an abundance of bar noise.

Hot chocolate might turn up at an American breakfast, but hot soybean milk is 
the drink of preference where northern Chinese congregate, be it Taipei, Hong 
Kong or Monterey Park. Only the soy milk is not served as a drink but as a soup 
to be sipped from a porcelain Chinese spoon. There are two styles: sweet and 
salty. The salty version contains savory ingredients such as green onion and 
preserved radish, and the sweet style contains only sugar. 
</P>
<P>
The mandatory accompaniment to this nutritious dish is yu t'iao, a Chinese 
cruller that looks like two long sticks of dough stuck together. A book from 
Taipei, "Recipe Treasures of China: Taiwan's Gourmet Delights," tells an 
interesting story about yu t'iao. It seems that some 800 years ago, a 
government minister, Chin Kuei, fabricated a charge that led to the execution 
of a popular field commander, Yueh Fei. This so enraged the people that they 
developed a way to knead and fold dough so that when fried it resembled two 
bodies, representing Chin Kuei and his wife. Eating the double cruller thus 
became a gustatory protest. 
</P>
<P>
Although once linked to anger, yu t'iao and its accompanying soy milk are in 
actuality a soothing start to the day. One place to try this combination is 
Yi-Mei, a Monterey Park bakery that has a few tables in addition to its large 
display of Chinese pastries. If you want to reproduce this breakfast at home, 
you can find the soy milk in Chinese groceries and buy yu t'iao at bakeries 
such as Yi-Mei that specialize in Mandarin style breads and cakes. A few slices 
of the cruller are stirred into the hot milk in a northern Chinese 
interpretation of the crouton. And if you want to expand the breakfast Taipei 
style, add an egg and a flaky, sesame-seed-sprinkled bun called shao bing. The 
buns are available at most large Chinese groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yi-Mei Bakery, 736 S. Atlantic Blvd., Monterey Park; (818) 284-9306. Open 7 
a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.

</P>
<P>
Heat soybean milk in saucepan. Add green onions, radish, soy sauce and sesame 
oil. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. Turn into individual serving 
bowl and add yu t'iao slices. Makes 1 serving.

At the New Otani Hotel and Garden in Los Angeles, displaced residents of Tokyo 
find the comforts of home in a breakfast of traditional Japanese foods selected 
as much for their variety, shape and color as for their taste. A menu of rice, 
pickles, fruit, tea and a source of protein -- usually eggs, fish, chicken or 
tofu -- is standard. Some restaurant variations include braised vegetables and 
baked eggs. 
</P>
<P>
There are two main course choices on the Japanese breakfast menu at the hotel's 
A Thousand Cranes Restaurant. Here, either piping hot rice porridge (asa-kayu) 
or grilled salted fish are accompanied by a tofu square topped with finely 
sliced bonito, grated ginger and sliced green onion; vinegar-pickled 
vegetables, including purple pickles, daikon radish and Chinese cabbage; miso 
soup, made from a salty, fermented soy bean paste; mixed fresh fruit; a bowl of 
pearly steamed rice and green tea. 
</P>
<P>
For the fish, coarse salt is sprinkled over a whole trout, mackerel, salmon or 
swordfish. The fish is skewered to retain its shape, then grilled over very hot 
charcoals or broiled. A dipping sauce brings out its subtle flavor. In some 
restaurants, cod marinated in a mixture of sake, soy sauce and mirin is served 
in place of the salted fish. Lemon wedges are served on the side. The porridge 
is surprisingly sweet, often made from leftover rice, occasionally mixed with 
red beans. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese interest in a perfect presentation is obvious in chef Nobuo Saga's 
garnishes: paper-thin slices of rolled bright-yellow omelet -- an 
egg-and-green-onion mixture fried in rectangular skillets, then rolled with a 
bamboo mat and cut into slivers. A sprig of green, dried flakes of shaved 
bonito (dashi), orange slices or a mound of shredded vegetables are some other 
common garnishes for the Otani's morning meal. 
</P>
<P>
To make the crepe-like omelet at home, use an ordinary omelet pan and trim the 
edges. Adding peas to the egg mixture, as in this recipe from "Step By Step 
Japanese Cooking" (Barron's, 1986) by Lesley Downer and Minoru Yoneda, lends 
color and extra flavor to the dish. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thousand Cranes Restaurant, New Otani Hotel &amp; Garden, 120 S. Los Angeles 
St., Los Angeles, (213) 629-1200. Open daily for breakfast from 6:30 to 10 
a.m.; dinner from 6 to 10 p.m. Lunch served Monday through Saturday from 11:30 
a.m. to 2 p.m. Touch of Japan brunch served Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
ROLLED OMELET WITH PEAS 
</P>
<P>
5 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1 cup Dashi 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon mirin 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 tablespoons light soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon peas 
</P>
<P>
Oil 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 tablespoons grated daikon radish 
</P>
<P>
Soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
Combine eggs, Dashi, mirin, light soy sauce and salt in bowl. Mix lightly with 
wire whisk. Stir in peas. Lightly brush omelet pan with oil and heat over 
moderately high heat. Pour in just enough egg mixture to coat pan, tilting pan 
so egg mixture forms even layer. When egg is set, tilt pan and roll top of 
omelet toward you to form roll at front of pan. Push roll toward back of pan. 
</P>
<P>
Brush pan with oil and pour small amount egg mixture into pan, lifting roll to 
allow egg mixture to flow underneath. Allow egg mixture to set, then repeat 
tilting pan and rolling omelet toward you until all egg mixture is used and 
thick roll is produced at end of pan. Place bamboo rolling mat over omelet and 
remove omelet from pan. Or, use slotted spatula. Roll omelet in bamboo mat, 
press gently and let stand 1 minute. 
</P>
<P>
Remove rolled omelet from mat and slice into 1-inch pieces. Arrange on small 
serving plates. Moisten daikon with small amount soy sauce and place small 
mound on each plate to garnish. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Dashi 
</P>
<P>
1 (4-inch) piece kombu seaweed 
</P>
<P>
Cold water 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons dried bonito flakes 
</P>
<P>
Combine kombu and 4 1/2 cups cold water in large saucepan. Slowly bring to 
boil, removing kombu just before water comes to boil. Reserve kombu. 
</P>
<P>
Add 1 tablespoon bonito flakes to liquid in saucepan and bring to full boil. 
Immediately remove from heat and allow flakes to settle. Strain bonito flakes 
through cheesecloth-lined sieve. Reserve flakes. Use broth for other recipes 
calling for mild Dashi stock. 
</P>
<P>
Place reserved kombu and bonito flakes in large saucepan. Add 7 1/2 cups cold 
water and heat to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes until stock is 
reduced by one-third. Add remaining 1 tablespoon dried bonito flakes and 
immediately remove from heat. Allow flakes to settle, then strain through 
cheesecloth-lined sieve. TONI TIPTON

Sabrina Middle Eastern Center, a sort of Middle Eastern general store and cafe

breakfast repast of ful medames, the national dish of Egypt (eaten for 
breakfast, lunch and dinner) plus its accompaniments of olives, tomatoes and 
pickles. The name, ful medames, is from the Egyptian ful (pronounced fool), 
meaning beans; medames is the method of cooking them over low heat overnight. 
The pot in which the beans cook is called qedra, a narrow-mouthed, fat-bellied 
brass or copper urn. 
</P>
<P>
At Sabrina, however, the beans used are actually canned from a recipe 
formulated by Haggar and packed under the Sabrina label. The breakfast comes 
also with an omelet made with basturma, the Middle Eastern dried beef from 
which the word pastrami originates, and falafel, which in Cairo is called 
tameya, served with all the pita bread you can eat. A sesame-molasses dip 
called asal wa tahina is an authentic sweet to round out the Egyptian breakfast 
with the finale: a tiny glass of traditional mint tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabrina Middle Eastern Center, 4325 Sepulveda Blvd., Culver City, (213) 
398-2308. Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday from 11 
a.m. to 3 p.m.

POMONA-PITZER TRIES TO CONTINUE ITS FAST START AGAINST WHITTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pomona-Pitzer football team, off to its best start since 1970, will try to 
remain undefeated when it plays host to Whittier in a Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at Strehle 
Field in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The Sagehens (2-0) defeated Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, 31-20, last week. It was 
Pomona-Pitzer's first victory over the Stags since 1985 and its first 
conference victory since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier (0-2) and has been outscored this season, 80-29. The Poets lost to 
Redlands, 42-16, last week. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona-Pitzer has already won as many games as it won the previous two seasons. 
The change in fortunes has been partly the result of an outstanding offense. 
The Sagehens lead the SCIAC in total offense with an average of 372 yards a 
game and passing offense at 237.5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Sagehens, who have outscored their first two opponents, 73-55, have been 
led by junior quarterback Scott Hamburg and sophomore running back Chris Smith. 
Hamburg is the leading passer in the SCIAC, having completed 29 of 58 passes 
for 475 yards and five touchdowns. Smith is leading the conference with an 
average of 102 yards rushing and 160 all-purpose yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier is ranked first in the conference in passing defense, having allowed 
an average of only 93 yards a game. Whittier's top offensive player has been 
quarterback Len Burton, who has completed 28 of 51 passes for 331 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In other games matching four-year colleges at 1:30 p.m. Saturday, Azusa Pacific 
(2-1) will play host to Humboldt State, La Verne (0-2) plays host to Occidental 
(1-2) and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (0-2) will entertain Menlo. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving its highest ranking of the season, the Cal Poly Pomona women's 
volleyball team will visit U.S. International University -- an NCAA Division I 
squad -- in a nonconference match on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who have moved up to No. 11 in the American Volleyball Coaches 
Assn. Division II rankings with a 19-5 record, finished third in the Cal State 
Dominguez Hills tournament behind Division II powers UC Riverside and 
Sacramento State. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, under the direction of first-year Coach Gene Krieger, has been sparked 
by sophomore right-side hitter Alicia Burns (5-8) and freshman left-side hitter 
Heather Matthews (5-11). 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have already won more games than they did last season, when they 
finished 16-18. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos open their California Collegiate Athletic Assn. schedule on Tuesday 
at 7:30 p.m. when they visit Chapman. Pomona placed fifth in the conference 
last season and Chapman finished in a tie for second with Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona men's soccer team, which gained a victory and a tie in a 
two-game road trip to Northern California last week, opens its California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. season with a match against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos tied San Francisco State, 1-1, and edged Cal State Hayward, 1-0, 
last week to improve their record to 2-4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been led on offense by senior midfielder Kip Shipley, who is among 
the conference scoring leaders with three goals and an assist for seven points. 
The Broncos have also received outstanding play from freshman goalkeeper Jay 
Olsen, who has a 1.29 goals-against average.

SENATE PANEL OKS SOUTER'S NOMINATION ON A 13-1 VOTE

<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13 to 1 to approve David Souter's 
nomination to the Supreme Court today, as respect for the New Hampshire 
jurist's intellect outweighed liberal concerns about his views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) cast the only vote against Souter. 
</P>
<P>
The full Senate is expected to confirm Souter, probably next week -- shortly 
after the Supreme Court begins its new term. He would become the court's 105th 
jurist and replace Justice William J. Brennan Jr., who retired in July after 34 
years on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) joined with six other committee 
Democrats and all six Republicans in supporting Souter. Like many of his 
Democratic colleagues, Biden said he was troubled by uncertainty surrounding 
Souter's positions on rights issues including abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"He's about the best, though, that we're going to be able to do from this 
Administration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in Cleveland to campaign for Republican candidates, said the 
committee vote "is good news for all of us who are committed to the 
Constitution of the United States. He'll be a superb justice for the Supreme 
Court."

N. HOLLYWOOD YOUTH HELD IN CRIME SPREE; MURDER CHARGE SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old North Hollywood boy was arrested this morning as a suspect in a 
one-day crime spree that included the killing of a rival gang member, the 
attempted murder of another, the robbery of three women and the theft and arson 
of a car, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
At least three other gang members are being sought as the suspect's 
accomplices, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was arrested at his home during a 7 a.m. raid by detectives 
investigating the shooting Sunday of Daniel Solis and Sayeed Fayad, both 19 and 
of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Solis was killed and Fayad was critically injured when they were gunned down in 
an alley behind the 13100 block of Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys. Police termed 
the shooting a "setup" because the two victims were shot as they approached a 
car they thought contained members of a friendly gang. The youths in the car 
had exchanged "passwords" with the victims before the shooting started. 
</P>
<P>
The youth arrested this morning is believed to be the person who fired the gun. 
Detective James Vojtecky said police were led to him by identifications from 
witnesses and undisclosed evidence relating to the car used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities found the car in the 14000 block of Sherman Way on Tuesday. It had 
been stripped and set on fire. Detectives learned it had been reported stolen 
about three hours before Solis and Sayeed were shot at 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said three women were in the car on a North Hollywood street when they 
were approached by four youths who robbed them of their purses and took the 
car. He said the suspect arrested in the shooting was also identified as one of 
the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was being held without bail on suspicion of murder at the Sylmar 
Juvenile Hall. Vojtecky said detectives will ask the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office to file charges of murder, attempted murder, 
robbery, car theft and arson against him Friday.

OIL PRICES FLIRT WITH $40 MARK ON NEW ANXIETY

<P>
Oil prices advanced today, moving briefly past the $40-a-barrel mark, as 
another round of antagonistic statements from Iraq overshadowed President 
Bush's decision to sell a small part of the government's oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The November contract for light, sweet crude was up 68 cents at $39.35 per 
42-gallon barrel at midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the session, the contract rose to $40.10, the first time the price 
of oil has traded above $40. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi threat to execute U.S. and other diplomats unless they hand over 
Westerners they are sheltering revived trader fears that a possible military 
conflict could disrupt oil supplies from Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The threat punctured the brief stability Bush's announcement had given the 
market. The November contract for crude fell to $37.67 in early trading before 
reversing course.

GENETIC PARENTS IN SURROGATE CASE GET TEMPORARY CUSTODY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A judge awarded temporary custody of an infant to his genetic parents this 
morning and trimmed the visiting privileges of the surrogate mother who was 
hired to bear the child. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert N. Parslow Jr. ordered that the 
child, called Michael Christian, be turned over to Mark and Crispina Calvert 
rather than to surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson pending a hearing next month. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, was paid $10,000 under a contract to bear the child, the product 
of in vitro fertilization of the Calverts' egg and sperm. 
</P>
<P>
The infant, a 6-pound, 10-ounce boy born eight days ago, has shown signs of the 
stress of the conflict, said the court-appointed guardian, William Steiner, at 
an Orange County Superior Court hearing this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner said he believed it would be "in the best interests of the baby . . . 
to remain with the Calverts." 
</P>
<P>
Parslow also decided today to cut Johnson's visitation rights from daily to 
twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
He could have placed the infant with Johnson, or in a foster home, pending full 
resolution of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark case, with potentially broad impact on the legal concept of 
parenthood, is the first in which a surrogate mother has claimed a child to 
whom she is not genetically linked.

A church deacon faced arraignment today for allegedly murdering a young 
neighbor after police investigating the teen-ager's disappearance found a body 
buried in his basement. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Meinholz, 52, a bookkeeper for a lumber company, was arrested Wednesday 
after the body was discovered in his cellar. 
</P>
<P>
The body was exhumed after authorities obtained a court order, and 
investigators are waiting the results of an autopsy today to confirm their 
suspicions that it was the remains of Melissa Benoit. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit, 13, vanished Sept. 15 after spending the afternoon watching television 
at another neighbor's house. Melissa's disappearance was brought to a national 
television audience Sept. 21 when Benoit's mother, Diane Richard, appealed for 
her daughter's return on the program "America's Most Wanted."

Myanmar's troops have entered West German, British and U.S. Embassy compounds 
and its military government has detained native employees of Western missions 
for interrogation, a diplomat said today. 
</P>
<P>
The military government, which has refused to turn the government over to an 
opposition movement that overwhelmingly won election in May, has stepped up 
arrests and intimidation of dissidents in the past month, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation on the human rights front is abysmal," said the diplomat, 
speaking at a news conference in Bangkok, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"An increasing number of governments view with horror what is going on in 
Burma," he said, using Myanmar's old name. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said troops entered the West German Embassy compound 10 days ago 
and have taken similar action against the American and British embassies a 
number of times previously. 
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar employees of the U.S., British and Australian embassies had 
been detained for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat did not say why the troops had entered the embassies. 
</P>
<P>
He said an oral protest over the embassy raids and human rights abuses was 
presented to the government Friday by the 12 members of the European Community, 
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and the United States.

U.S. CHAMBER ISN'T SHY IN ITS PURSUIT OF NOBEL PEACE PRIZE

<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce pushed for the soon-to-be-announced Nobel Peace 
Prize in a secret campaign so brash it embarrassed even some of its own 
employees, according to documents and a former worker. 
</P>
<P>
The business federation nicknamed its campaign "Special Project." 
</P>
<P>
It courted U.S. lawmakers, world leaders and a former prize winner to get 
itself nominated for the award. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber's pitch was that it has helped bring democracy and a free 
enterprise economy to Eastern Europe and the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the chamber drafted a nominating letter that said it "richly 
deserves international recognition for its bold and visionary leadership in the 
cause of human freedom, which is a prerequisite to world peace." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber was nominated by David A. Morse, a New York attorney who was 
director general of the International Labor Organization, and Sen. Richard G. 
Lugar (R-Ind.). 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be embarrassed if I were promoting myself that much," said Barry King, the 
organization's media relations director until June. "It seems to me the people 
who have won it didn't need to toot their own horn so much." 
</P>
<P>
But Milt Mitler, chamber vice president for public liaison, said Wednesday, "It 
was not a campaign. We were nominated for the prize by Sen. Lugar and Mr. 
Morse. We had to give them both historic information on what the chamber does 
or has done."

Britain and Iran announced today they have restored diplomatic relations, which 
were severed over the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call for Muslims to 
kill Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
The restoration -- announced at the United Nations by British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd and in a statement from Iran's U.N. Mission -- said the embassies 
would reopen in London and Tehran within a month. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement was also made in Tehran by Iran's official Islamic Republic 
News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian statement gave no reason for the restoration of relations, saying 
only that it was based on "mutual respect." 
</P>
<P>
Hurd said that in recent statements Iran had made clear its respect for 
international law and had pledged not to interfere in the internal matters of 
other nations. That was taken as an assurance that Iran would not try to send 
assassins after Rushdie, who is believed to be in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd said the other outstanding issues between the two countries, including the 
four British hostages held in Lebanon by Islamic fundamentalists loyal to 
Iran's Shiite revolution, are better discussed at the full diplomatic level. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has recently been less hostile to the West and has said it is cooperating 
with the U.N.'s economic boycott against Iraq, designed to force it to withdraw 
its forces from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, Khomeini issued the death threat against Rushdie, saying his 
novel, which offended Muslims worldwide, blasphemed Islam. Iranian officials 
did not terminate the threat when Khomeini died in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
They had demanded that Britain condemn the book as a condition to restoring 
relations. That demand was apparently dropped.

ADVENTURES IN BABY-SITTING: MEET THE "AU PAIR FROM HELL"

A nanny from Montana became the "au pair from hell" to a couple who says she 
wrecked their car and racked up more than $70,000 in bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Bronson and Robert Dolinko said they wanted a wholesome live-in from the 
heartland to help out while Bronson spent the rest of her pregnancy with her 
second child in bed, on her doctor's advice. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd heard horror stories about the foreign girls who just want to come to 
California for a good time," said Bronson, a psychotherapist. "So we thought, 
'Oh great, we'll get someone from the Midwest.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the couple ended up with an "au pair from hell story," she said. 
</P>
<P>
They hired 18-year-old Angela Marie Sandberg on July 16 through All-American 
Childcare Inc., an Orange County company that supplies au pairs. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg, of Lolo, Mont., promptly wrecked the couple's car after driving it to 
a nightclub, Bronson said. 
</P>
<P>
They fired her July 30, then their telephone started ringing. Clothing boutique 
owners and grocers left with their ex-nanny's checks wanted their money, 
Bronson said. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley police arrested Sandberg on Sept. 7 at an Emeryville motel after her 
boyfriend tried to cash a $15,000 check she had written to him so he could 
start his own business, Police Cpl. Michael Sloan said.

Bombs exploded early today at two U.S. pharmaceutical firms, and another device 
was defused at a local branch of a U.S. bank in the sixth attack on an American 
firm within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
There was no claim of responsibility and no injuries in the pre-dawn blasts, 
which followed bombings Wednesday at Coca-Cola and Pepsi plants in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the attacks have been carried out by military extremists seeking 
to topple President Corazon Aquino by scaring away investors and embarrassing 
the government abroad. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said today that he discussed the Manila attacks 
with Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos, and Platt urged American firms to "hang 
in there and be careful." 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident today, police defused a small bomb at the Boston Bank of 
the Philippines in suburban Kalookan. 
</P>
<P>
About half an hour later, two joggers threw a bomb at the headquarters of the 
Squibb drug firm in suburban Makati. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, witnesses said two joggers also threw a device at the 
headquarters of another American pharmaceutical firm -- Wyeth Suaco 
Laboratories.

LOSSES SPUR FDIC TO RAISE BANK PREMIUM; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE FUND INSURING BANK DEPOSITS IS AT ITS LOWEST POINT IN HISTORY AND 
COULD BE WIPED OUT BY A RECESSION.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. today raised the insurance premium for 
commercial banks by more than 60% in a move aimed at bolstering its 
deteriorating insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Starting next year, the rate will be 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits, up from 
12 cents this year. 
</P>
<P>
It is the maximum increase allowed by law. 
</P>
<P>
The action came after the five-member board heard a financial report showing 
that losses to the fund from bank failures were even heavier than anticipated 
in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The fund decreased from $13.2 billion at the end of 1989 to $11.4 billion at 
the end of June -- a 14% drop. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said he anticipated losses for the year would 
be closer to $3 billion rather than the $2 billion he expected only one month 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.84-billion loss in the first half of the year has reduced the level of 
reserves in the fund to only 60 cents for $100 insured deposits. The minimum 
level considered safe is $1.25 per $100. 
</P>
<P>
The level of reserves is at the lowest point in the fund's history. The 
congressional General Accounting Office has warned that if the economy dips 
into a recession, the fund could be wiped out and require a taxpayer bailout.

OIL SHOCK COULD DRAIN WORLD BANK, CHIEF SAYS

In a new indication of the escalating economic fallout from the Persian Gulf 
turmoil, the head of the World Bank said today that he may be forced to call 
upon rich nations to boost their support for the international lending 
institution by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
World Bank President Barber Conable said that if oil prices remain at current 
high levels over the next three months, his institution would not have enough 
in existing resources to cushion the shock on the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
Conable's comments represented a change from his position just a few days ago. 
At that time, he and officials of the the International Monetary Fund insisted 
that they could handle the economic impact of the gulf crisis with available 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
However, as delegates from 154 member countries of the two institutions were 
holding their annual meeting this week, the price of oil jumped at one point to 
close to $40. 
</P>
<P>
Conable told reporters today that if oil prices stayed at high levels into 
1991, he believed it would be necessary to ask for voluntary contributions from 
major industrial countries and oil-producing nations. That money would be used 
to make no-interest loans to countries especially hard hit by the rise in oil 
prices and other economic fallouts from the gulf turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials of the World Bank suggested that the proposed new lending 
facility would be available to work with the Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination 
Group, the steering committee of donor countries unveiled by President Bush in 
his speech to the IMF-World Bank opening session on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that donations raised by the crisis group, which is headed by 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, might be funneled to this new lending 
facility for distribution to needy countries.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that maverick oilman T. 
Boone Pickens and his Mesa Limited Partnership agreed to pay a $2.3-million 
settlement in the sale of a gold mining stock. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement requires Mesa "to disgorge $2.3 million in profits obtained as a 
result of conduct as alleged in the complaint" to pay claims by Homestake 
Mining Co. shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's complaint stems from an announcement by Pickens and Mesa on Feb. 
29, 1988, offering to purchase the gold mining company "in a negotiated 
transaction," the SEC said. That announcement caused Homestake's stock price to 
surge by nearly $4 a share, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
But over the next two weeks, Pickens and Mesa sold more than 3 million shares 
of Homestake stock without disclosing their intent to sell a substantial 
portion of Mesa's holdings of Homestake common stock.

WRITER WANTS PATRIOTS' OWNER SUSPENDED;

The Boston Herald reporter who said she was sexually harassed in the New 
England Patriots locker room called today for the suspension of the NFL club's 
owner and fines for the players involved. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're asking is (for) Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner, to suspend 
Victor Kiam," Lisa Olson said. "(Kiam is) a joke, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
Olson also said Zeke Mowatt, the only player she identified in the incident 
which the Herald said involved five players, should be fined a substantial 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
Other reporters said Kiam called Olson a "classic bitch." 
</P>
<P>
"Zeke Mowatt was fined the other day, $2,000. This guy makes a $630,000 salary. 
It'll be spread around 14 weeks and that's like fining me a quarter a week," 
Olson said on CBS' "This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
She said Mowatt, whom she previously identified as having stood close to her 
and exposing himself, was not the only player who made lewd or sexist remarks 
on Sept. 17 as she conducted an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The others should be "identified and fined a substantial amount," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had been sitting on a bench at the time and was too embarrassed to 
look up and see who the other players were. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said she planned to be at Sunday's home game against New York despite her 
newspaper's editorial calling for a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm covering the game against the Jets on Sunday. They don't win any games on 
the field anyway and this is another one they won't win," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald and national women's groups also want action taken against Kiam and 
Mowatt. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue may decide to suspend, fine or reprimand Mowatt next week after he 
has met with the player and hears his side of the story, NFL spokesman Joe 
Browne said Wednesday. Tagliabue has ordered Mowatt to report to the NFL office 
in New York by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kiam, who also owns the company that makes Remington electric shavers, has been 
criticized for his failure to condemn Mowatt and for his comments regarding 
Olson. 
</P>
<P>
Herald sports editor Bob Sales told the New York Times that he sent a letter to 
Tagliabue calling for Kiam's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Himmelberg of the Orange County Register, president of the Assn. for 
Women in Sports Media, was quoted in USA Today on Wednesday as saying that the 
organization will demand that Tagliabue make an example of Kiam to prevent 
"unjust harassment" of female reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Kiam has denied the comments attributed to him, saying he called Olson 
"aggressive." He apologized for any mistreatment by his employees, but Olson 
refused to accept the apology. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I accept his apology after he questioned my professionalism in front 
of hundreds of thousands of television viewers?" Olson said in Wednesday's 
editions of The Herald. "It's obvious the Patriots are trying to bury the 
sexual-harassment issue by trying to discredit me with blatant lies. I am the 
victim here and they are putting me on trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The apology was a start, but the issue is not whether Victor Kiam thinks I'm a 
'classic bitch.' If the Patriots are interested in solving this issue, how 
about making public the names of the players who verbally and sexually harassed 
me instead of covering up for them?" 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Globe reported that several players, who asked not to be identified, 
said Wednesday night that the entire squad expressed serious regrets about the 
Olson incident at a team meeting on Monday. They said a letter of apology, 
written by Coach Rod Rust and signed by the team, was to have been presented to 
Olson Wednesday. The players said Patriots General Manager Sullivan decided 
against the letter, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
"What was given to me as a potential apology by the players in my opinion did 
not address the issues and the concerns of the public and our fans," Sullivan 
told the Globe.

night.

<P>
Boggs, a five-time American League batting champion, had to leave Tuesday

He went 0-3 against the Indians' Greg Swindell, extending his slump to 0-12 and 
1-20 and dropping his average to .304. 
</P>

Boggs is 19 hits shy of joining Wee Willie Keeler as the only major league

TAGLIABUE HAS JOB: CLEAN ANIMAL HOUSE FOR WOMEN WRITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last 20 years, since women sportswriters have been allowed to interview 
athletes in locker rooms, there have been some uncomfortable incidents, from 
fraternity house-style heckling to a USFL player running a razor up the leg of 
one writer. Jack Morris, a Detroit Tigers pitcher, said to a Detroit Free Press 
summer female intern, "I don't talk to women when I'm naked unless I'm on top 
of them or they're on top of me." The intern was a Harvard graduate; Morris was 
from the school of Neanderthal thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Women have had to suffer fools in locker rooms for a long time, but nothing as 
reprehensible as what happened recently in the New England Patriots' locker 
room. During the middle of an interview, several naked players surrounded 
Boston Herald sportswriter Lisa Olson, reportedly inches from her face, and 
dared her to touch their genitals. Difficult as it may be to believe, owner 
Victor Kiam later made it worse. 
</P>
<P>
Within earshot of several male reporters in the locker room after Sunday's 
game, Kiam called Olson "a classic bitch." Much more offensive than that, Mr. 
Remington Shaver told a Herald reporter the Patriots could "wiggle their 
waggles in front of her face as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kiam, now deeply concerned with damage control from his outrageous 
remarks, issued a statement of apology that ended with, "I now hope that we can 
get back to preparing our team for the Jets game on Sunday." Olson did not 
accept it. Good for her. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, just two weeks ago, warned Falcons Coach Jerry 
Glanville in no uncertain terms that the league would not tolerate one coach 
calling another a "jerk" as Glanville did Houston's Jack Pardee. Tagliabue 
moved quickly and decisively to head off what he perceived as a behavior 
problem that would negatively affect the league's image. 
</P>
<P>
When asked Tuesday about the Patriots' sleazy behavior with Olson (which 
happened on Sept. 17), Tagliabue was noncommittal about whether the league 
would take action beyond the Patriots issuing a token fine of $2,000 to one of 
the players, reportedly tight end Zeke Mowatt. "I really don't have all the 
facts," Tagliabue said, "so I don't want to comment because I'm not all clear 
what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Kiam and General Manager Patrick Sullivan already have apologized. A Patriots 
public relations man was standing nearby and has acknowledged seeing at least 
part of what happened. Ronnie Lippett, a veteran Patriot with a touch of class, 
sought out Olson and told her to hang in there, that she was only doing her job 
and doing it well at that. Tagliabue ought to tell Kiam and the Patriots -- and 
the 27 other clubs for that matter -- publicly that this behavior will not be 
tolerated, that violators will be hit with heavy fines and meaningful 
suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
No precedent-setting rule is needed; the NFL already has one that calls for 
equal access to all accredited reporters. If the Patriots players or any others 
don't like it -- which is their prerogative -- then tell the woman you'd like 
to get dressed before conducting an interview. Or, if you feel even stronger 
about it, tell her you'll talk to her outside the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller issue here is sports locker rooms. The locker room isn't always a 
battleground for women reporters. The Post's Christine Brennan estimates she's 
been in "more than 500 locker rooms in my 10 years and I've never had a bad 
incident." Also, the vast majority of players aren't interested in harassing 
women; they want to get dressed and go home. 
</P>
<P>
But there are always the boys from Animal House who think that because they are 
professional athletes they're also above the law. They can say or do whatever 
they want and get away with it. And to show just how rough and tough they are, 
these brainless bullies surround a woman in a locker room and behave boorishly. 
</P>
<P>
How manly.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: HEAD LICE EASILY OVERCOME BY OVER-THE-COUNTER PREPARATIONS 
</P>

The first day of school was Christine's birthday. To make up for the 
disappointment, her mother promised she could invite her friends to sleep over. 
</P>
<P>
The slumber party was a big hit with everyone who attended, but one party favor 
that no one wanted went home with the other girls. Unknown to her mother, 
Amanda had lice and innocently shared her infestation with her friends. 
</P>
<P>
Lice infestation has nothing to do with cleanliness, social class, or age, 
although school children suffer far more often than adults. But even nursing 
home residents are vulnerable. Americans fight more than 10 million cases a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed. They suck blood roughly every 
three to four hours, injecting an anti-clotting chemical that causes intense 
itching. Eggs are firmly attached to the hair shaft close to the scalp and may 
be more easily seen than the insect itself. Eggs hatch in 7 to 10 days and the 
nymphs take two weeks longer to mature. 
</P>
<P>
Killing lice is easy. There are lots of effective over-the-counter lice 
shampoos from A-200 and R&amp;C to Rid and Triple-X. They all contain 
pyrethrins, a chemical insecticide derived from chrysanthemums. 
</P>
<P>
A new creme rinse, Nix, contains a related compound, permethrin. It used to be 
available only by prescription, but has recently been approved for 
over-the-counter use. 
</P>
<P>
Two other insecticidal products are available only by prescription. Kwell and 
Kwildane contain lindane, while Ovide contains malathion. These lotions are 
also effective at killing lice. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is preventing reinfestation. None of the available products 
reliably kills every nit. Although malathion and permethrin are supposed to 
persist on the hair shaft and affect nymphs as they emerge, removing the nits 
is a wise public health precaution. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a simple task. Nits are "cemented" to hair and are difficult to 
remove even with a fine-toothed comb. A solution of half white vinegar and half 
rubbing alcohol may loosen the cement and make this task a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
Any clothing, pillowcases or sheets should be washed in hot water and dried at 
high temperature. Combs and brushes should be soaked in very hot water for at 
least 10 minutes. Stuffed animals, headphones and other items that cannot be 
washed, dry-cleaned or boiled should be isolated in plastic bags for at least 
two weeks.

Joseph Badamo, the jockey accused of conspiring to fix a race at the Finger 
Lakes Race Track last year, will return to riding Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Badamo is scheduled to ride Dibi-Dibi in the sixth race at the track outside 
Canandaigua, for his first mount since his license was reinstated this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors had accused Badamo of conspiring to rig the outcome of a 
1989 race by holding back his horse, Shine Please. Three other people were also 
charged in the alleged scheme, which was uncovered during an investigation in 
which the FBI secretly bought a horse and ran it at the track. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against the four were dropped by a federal judge in Rochester in July.

PAT ROBERTSON TARGETS NEA OVER 'SEX' IN ATLANTA PUPPET SHOW

Evangelist Pat Robertson charged today that a children's puppet show featured 
simulated oral sex during a performance last week at an Atlanta arts festival 
allegedly subsidized by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson's claims were vigorously denied by the NEA, the Georgia state arts 
council and puppeteer Jon Ludwig of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just the latest example of the continual distortion of fact by the 
arts endowment's most virulent critics, those intent on eliminating the agency 
at any cost, even that of the truth," said chief NEA spokesman Jack 
Lichtenstein. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the puppet show, performed at the Atlanta Arts Festival on 
Friday before 800 people, including children, featured "approximately five 
minutes of simulated foreplay between two puppets followed by an exhibit of 
oral sex acts." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, a 1988 presidential candidate, said his Christian Coalition in 
Chesapeake, Va., responded by generating 27,000 petitions demanding that the 
NEA be abolished and sending them Tuesday to every member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtenstein and Frank Ratka, the council's executive director, denied that any 
NEA funds went to the festival.

A county judge said he will take over questioning of potential jurors today if 
lawyers in the nation's first obscenity trial of a museum and its director fail 
to make a more serious effort to seat a jury. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to do something to move this along," Hamilton County Judge 
David Albanese said. 
</P>
<P>
He had said Wednesday that the court will remain in session as long as 
necessary today to get a jury seated. 
</P>
<P>
The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, face misdemeanor 
charges of pandering obscenity and displaying nude photos of children in an 
exhibit of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, lawyers had rejected eight prospective jurors and tentatively 
seated seven. 
</P>
<P>
Albanese warned attorneys to limit their questions to those that would 
determine whether a juror could be fair and impartial. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to be educated in the law or indoctrinated into cases of the 
state or defense," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
While defense lawyers had sought to expose bias toward homosexuals, potential 
jurors must distinguish between art and obscenity in weighing the charges over 
seven of the 175 photos from the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the defense persuaded the judge to remove two prospective jurors 
who admitted they were prejudiced against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, asked one potential juror, "Was that a 
strike against the Contemporary Arts Center to know it was exhibiting works of 
a homosexual?" 
</P>
<P>
She replied that it was not.

TRANSSEXUAL CAN'T MARRY, COURT RULES

A transsexual actress who once appeared as a James Bond playmate has no legal 
right to marry a man because she was born a boy, a European court ruled today, 
upholding British law. 
</P>
<P>
The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, said Caroline 
Cossey's rights under the European Convention on Human Rights had not been 
breached when Britain refused to alter her birth certificate. 
</P>
<P>
The model and actress, whose stage name is Tula, said she was "bitterly 
disappointed" by the court's decision and declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cossey, 35, who appeared in "For Your Eyes Only,' had claimed her human rights 
were infringed because she is not allowed under British law to change the sex 
on her birth certificate. As a result, she cannot legally marry a man in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Cossey, born Barry, had a sex-change operation 15 years ago.

BOYCOTT: BLACK OUTLETS HIT SONY OVER JAPANESE CABINET MINISTER'S SLUR.

Two black-owned radio stations are boycotting new releases from Sony Corp.'s 
CBS Records because of a racial slur by a Japanese Cabinet minister, a station 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Tamburro, programming director for WDAS-FM, said his station and WDAS-AM 
will continue to play CBS records but will not play any new releases. 
</P>
<P>
Tamburro said "a whole bunch of stuff" came out this week that the station has 
not played. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott is in retaliation for a comment made recently by Japanese Justice 
Minister Seiroku Kajiyama, who compared prostitutes in Tokyo to black Americans 
who move into white neighborhoods and force whites out. 
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama, who has since apologized for the slur, made the statement after 
watching a raid on prostitutes in a red-light district in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because blacks move in 
and whites are forced out," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Tamburro said he did not know how long the record boycott will be in effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving CBS an opportunity to respond to the racist statement by the 
Japanese government," he said. "Certainly a company as large as Sony would have 
some influence on the Japanese government. We're not trying to do anything but 
stop racism." 
</P>
<P>
CBS Records in New York had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
WDAS-AM and WDAS-FM are owned by Unity Broadcasting Inc. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
CBS's Japanese parent, Sony, bought the record company in 1988 for $2 billion.

MAN OF ACTION LUNDGREN STRIVES FOR GENTLER ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SCOTT, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dolph Lundgren, the Swedish import who has become a super-macho action star, 
studied at Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology and holds a degree in 
engineering from the University of Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
But he sure didn't leave his heart behind in a test tube. 
</P>
<P>
"Chemistry is dull," he said. "You deal with test tubes and computers all day. 
As an actor you deal with beautiful women and world travel and it pays much 
better." 
</P>
<P>
In his latest movie, "I Come in Peace," the towering 6-foot-6 Lundgren plays an 
American, with vestiges of Visigoth. He's a Houston, Tex., detective who 
tackles a pair of 7-foot galactic aliens, one of whom is a drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
While he may play sinister roles, there is a disquieting off-screen tranquility 
about the big Swede, which belies his film persona. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the event he is mistaken for a jolly Scandinavian pussycat, one need 
only recall he hospitalized Sylvester Stallone with a bruised heart during a 
fight scene for "Rocky IV," in which Dolph played a Russian heavyweight champ 
named Drago. 
</P>
<P>
"In this picture I play a violent man. He has to be violent because he's a 
cop," Lundgren said in an interview. "I see nothing wrong with violence, but 
today you have to add different ingredients like romance, comedy and drama to 
go along with the special effects. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps if it is played partly tongue-in-cheek, like Bruce Willis did in 'Die 
Hard 2,' then audiences accept it for what it is -- fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving a considerable body count in his wake in "View to a Kill," 
"Master of the Universe," "Red Scorpion" and "The Punisher, " Lundgren longs to 
play a gentler soul. 
</P>
<P>
He is inching up on that goal by playing Americans with diminishing 
Scandinavian accents. 
</P>
<P>
"I am involved in less bloodshed in 'Cover Up,' a film I made in Israel," 
Lundgren said. "It's a suspense thriller with me playing a CIA man. There's 
only a small dose of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done seven movies now, and I'm looking for projects that will allow me to 
use some acting. The way I see it, these are career moves to position myself in 
the business and establish myself as an actor. I'm still young enough to play 
it smart for a couple of years so I can broaden my career. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than play it safe, I'll take as many chances as possible to show what I 
can do. Action films are popular now, but who is to say how long the cycle will 
go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking short term, take-the-money-and-run. I want some personal 
satisfaction from the projects I appear in. But I may have to take some detours 
en route to where I want to go. You must have the vision yourself and set your 
own goals. People in Hollywood won't do that for you."
