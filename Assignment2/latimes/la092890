First, Schwab's, now . . . 7-Eleven? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, aspiring actors, the next time you drop in for a microwaved burrito, you 
can leave your resume and photo in a drop-off box at the convenience store. And 
Culver City-based Gateway Information Services promises to distribute it to 
casting directors (if it doesn't have too many burrito stains). 
</P>
<P>
The catch is you first have to call Gateway's 900 line (at 95 cents a minute) 
and jot down the "listing code" of the job that interests you. Then you must 
write the code on the outside of the envelope that you drop off at any of five 
7-Elevens on the Westside. (Apparently, Gateway figures there are no 
prospective thespians in Downey or Encino or Pomona.) 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed since Lana Turner was supposedly discovered while drinking a 
malt. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, Gateway lists only acting and technical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't the company know that everyone in L.A.'s a screenwriter these days? 
</P>
<P>
Which reminds us: Some Cal Poly Pomona students broke a world record by 
building a 201-foot bean-and-cheese burrito, which they cut up and sold to 
raise money for charity. It wasn't microwaved. 
</P>
<P>
An alleged counterfeiter was arrested in Hollywood but police are accusing him 
of passing a bogus dress, rather than bogus money. He allegedly claimed it was 
one worn by Rita Hayworth in a 1946 film. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested John B. Ponca, 36, the owner of a memorabilia shop, after 
investigators took the dress to Santa Barbara and showed it to Jean Louis, 
designer of the original costume for the movie, "Gilda." They concluded the 
dress might date back only 30 years or so. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Curry, a collector, purchased the garment from Ponca for $3,500. Curry 
said he first suspected the costume was bogus after he removed it from its 
frame. The dress had been mounted like a Da Vinci. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to choose the proper car-pool. That seems to be the message of a 
witty Richard Gerrish painting, which is part of the "Carpool" exhibit at the 
Pacific Mutual Building on West 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The show opens Monday in conjunction with the start of Rideshare Week. Gerrish 
depicts a maze of traffic, including cars tumbling into a pool of water. Not 
what Commuter Computer had in mind.

AIDS ASSISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As you noted in your editorial ("Do's and Don'ts of Budgeting," Sept. 15), 
Congress has overwhelmingly authorized disaster relief for those cities hardest 
hit by the AIDS epidemic and assistance to all 50 states to develop more 
cost-efficient programs of AIDS care. However, in the continuing budget 
standoff, the actual appropriation of the funds needed to enact these critical 
programs is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
While the federal government has made a substantial investment in HIV research 
and prevention, spending for AIDS care and treatment remains utterly 
inadequate. Congress and the President should carefully assess the much higher 
costs of allowing urban health care systems to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
It has been clearly demonstrated that AIDS care can be delivered at 
substantially lower cost -- through early treatment, ambulatory medical 
services and home care. These are the programs that the Ryan White AIDS Care 
Act will make possible. The most costly mistake of all is continued inaction.

RIGHTS WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
NARROW JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department is risking further harassment at polling places with an 
ill-considered opinion on an incident that marred Orange County's November, 
1988, Election Day. The opinion represents an all too narrow view of the U.S. 
Voting Rights Act, which is deprived of meaning if it cannot ensure the 
integrity of the ballot place. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Republican Party had posted uniformed guards, some equipped 
with signs in Spanish warning noncitizens not to vote, at 20 Santa Ana 
precincts in largely Latino neighborhoods of the 72nd Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans said guards were needed because of rumors that Democrats would bus 
in illegal voters, but Democrats and Latinos accused the GOP of intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Who was right? All the facts have never come out, but last year GOP officials 
paid five Latinos a $400,000 settlement in a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Now, government criminal inquiries are still dragging on. U.S. Deputy Assistant 
Atty. Gen. Bruce C. Navarro, asked about their status by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San 
Diego), said federal laws may not apply because there was no violence -- a 
troubling suggestion that other shenanigans might be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro's point that plaintiffs were not actually deterred from voting was 
addressed well in the civil case by U.S. Dist. Judge J. Spencer Letts, who said 
the more important issue was any threat of such an intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good thing Navarro's narrow perspective is being reviewed by Congress. A 
broader view of government's interest in fair play on Election Day is needed.

THE DRIVE TO BE AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE; 
</P>
<P>
THE STATE MUST KEEP ITS LEAD IN POLLUTION-CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Air Resources Board is in Los Angeles today, taking one last 
look at its plan to require virtually all cars sold in California by the year 
2000 to run far cleaner than anything now on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Short of some miraculous disclosure that Southern California is no longer the 
nation's smog capital -- a most unlikely development -- it should plunge right 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly nothing that Chairman Jan Sharpless and the eight other board members 
heard during Thursday's public hearing argued persuasively that the state 
should not -- as is its habit -- lead the nation into a new generation of 
pollution-control. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the state board's goals will support the transportation targets of 
Southern California's chief smog control agency. The South Coast Air Quality 
Management District is implementing the nation's strictest anti-pollution 
controls in an effort to wipe the skies clean enough to meet federal 
air-quality standards by early in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
One state goal is to have every car sold in California during the model year 
2003 meet what the board staff calls "ultra clean" standards. Even before 2003, 
a rising percentage of them would have to reduce the key ingredients of smog 
that escape from their tailpipes. 
</P>
<P>
The two worst actors in that regard are hydrocarbons (mostly fumes of unburned 
gasoline) and nitrogen oxides (a byproduct of any burning of fossil fuels). 
Under the plan, the progress in cutting these deadly emissions would be steady 
and impressive. For example, by 1996, one of every five new cars on the road 
would have to cut hydrocarbon emissions to half of what they were just three 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting stricter standards will require a three-way effort. Manufacturers will 
have to redesign engines. The oil industry will have to redesign formulas for 
refineries that produce fuel for those engines. 
</P>
<P>
The third effort involves the motorist. We would all have to pay more for cars 
and fuels. Although nobody even wants to guess how much more, it is encouraging 
to note that the board staff says that the Nissan Sentra on the road today 
already meets the 1994 hydrocarbon standard. So some are ahead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The air board also wants somewhere between 2% and 10% of new cars built between 
1998 and 2003 to spread absolutely no pollutants around. The only vehicle that 
meets that description today is an electric car. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the goal is less radical than it might have sounded 10 years ago. 
Southern California Edison Co. and the L. A. Department of Water and Power 
already have invested $7 million in a program to build an experimental fleet of 
10,000 electric cars over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the board wants higher standards and lower pollution levels for 
reformulated fuel to power the cars already on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The enterprise is neither doubt-free nor risk-free. As before, some industry 
leaders ask where the new technology will come from and worry that it can't be 
done. As before, California has no real choice but to try.

SEN. THURMOND'S REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kudos to The Times for your editorial "Lovely Ladies" (Sept. 23) regarding Sen. 
Strom Thurmond's (R-S.C.) sneering sarcasm toward the five fabulous females 
testifying at the Souter hearings. 
</P>
<P>
When I opened the telephone lines at noon that day on my radio show (KGIL), I 
was deluged with calls from women still reeling from the jolt of actually 
seeing before their eyes the insidious, patronizing dismissal of accomplished, 
articulate Americans testifying for their constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but the Good Ole Boy Strom did us festering females a fine favor. He jolted 
us into renewed vigor in realizing that sexism is as nasty and pernicious as 
racism. I would have liked to see the outcry had Thurmond called a panel of 
black men lovely "boys."

CONSPIRACY THEORY IN BLACK COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Call Racism by Its Real Name," by Mark Ridley-Thomas 
(Commentary, Sept. 15): 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, social activists like Ridley-Thomas tend to lose their 
objectivity in their zeal to challenge society on issues such as race-related 
crime. To those of us who prefer facts over rhetoric, there are certainly 
missing pieces to the puzzle of the Amber Jefferson story that prevent a 
conclusive determination about the motives of those involved in the 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Was this another of the epithet-strewn street fights in the greater Los Angeles 
area, blown out of proportion because of the simple race of the combatants? Or 
was the fight motivated by racial hatred? From all available (media) evidence, 
it is hard to say. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it seems premature, if not an outright denial of due process, for 
Ridley-Thomas to demand that the Orange County district attorney's office 
impose hate crime charges on the alleged perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I read in The Times about a Latino man who was seriously beaten by a 
group of black men in a mostly black neighborhood after a traffic accident. I 
noticed Ridley-Thomas did not include this incident in his listing of hate 
crimes against "people of color." 
</P>
<P>
As an African-American, I am deeply concerned about the state of ethnic and 
racial relationships in Southern California. However, extremism in public 
commentary will leave people confused and unconvinced about the potential 
dangers of racial intolerance.

A HUMORLESS AND ARROGANT OVERREACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Colman McCarthy's syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting ticked off because an unreformable old buck uses a double-standard 
phrase that was, at worst, the equivalent of a burp, showed Molly Yard 
caricaturing the humorless and hypersensitive side of feminism. 
</P>
<P>
Yard came to the hearings on a mission of wild zealotry, consistent with an 
abortion-rights fanaticism that led her to say that confirming David Souter 
would mean "ending freedom for women in this country." 
</P>
<P>
This style of apocalyptic trembling, fit for an embattled speech at an abortion 
rally, puts Yard over the line that separates authentic social revolutionaries 
from cause-mongering pop-offs who are so sure of the correctness of their 
stance that anything slightly askew -- especially the near-harmless remark of 
an 87-year-old codger -- is not allowed to stand. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing against Souter, Molly Yard had much to say about women's rights and 
reproductive rights but nothing on fetal rights. She defines women's freedom in 
a narrowness that she would find intolerable if expressed by the other side. 
For Yard, women's freedom means full empowerment to kill what is alive and 
growing, which is a bizarre definition of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Many credible feminists -- female and male -- reject the violence of abortion 
because they oppose all forms of violence. Molly Yard doesn't speak for them.

PERSPECTIVE ON BREAST CANCER; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S NOT JUST A TRAGIC PART OF LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
A DISEASE THAT AFFLICTS SO MANY WOMEN IS A SOCIAL CONCERN ENTITLED TO THE FULL 
FORCE OF NATIONAL ACTIVISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH ROSEN, Ruth Rosen, a professor of history at UC Davis, is the author of 
The Lost Sisterhood: Prostitution in America and is working on a history of 
contemporary American feminism. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When does a disease become a political issue? When it is contagious, incurable 
and kills those who are still vigorous enough to mount a campaign to grab 
public interest and funding. Every year 140,000 women are diagnosed with breast 
disease; every year 42,000 women die of it. I am not the only person who, while 
watching one more television program on AIDS, has noted that every two years 
more women die from breast cancer than all the people in the United States who 
have ever died from AIDS. Yet, because breast cancer is not a contagious or 
predictably incurable disease, and because women have not yet defined it as a 
"women's issue," what should be seen as a major social and political problem is 
regarded as a tragic and somehow biologically fated part of women's lot. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to suggest that AIDS should receive any less attention or funding. 
On the contrary, women have a great deal to learn from groups that have 
successfully publicized and politicized the horror of the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
But it is time for national women's organizations to comprehend that a disease 
that afflicts so many women is more than a medical problem -- it is a social 
concern entitled to the full force of national activism. What, for example, has 
caused the incidence of breast cancer to rise from one out of 11 women to one 
out of 10? Is it the result of better detection, longer life spans or have 
environmental pollution, oral contraceptives and dietary habits somehow caused 
a greater proliferation of the disease? Why do so many doctors and insurance 
companies fail to encourage or cover preventive mammograms? 
</P>
<P>
Because women are at particular risk, breast cancer is a women's issue waiting 
to be recognized as such. This doesn't mean that other problems, including 
abortion rights, are any less important. But a single-issue orientation has 
obscured the reality that breast cancer kills women with terrifying frequency. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston and Oakland, women who have survived cancer have started 
organizations (the Cambridge Women's Community Cancer Project and the Oakland's 
Women's Cancer Resource Center) to lobby for better preventive care, increased 
research funding and improved insurance coverage and to provide information and 
support groups for breast cancer patients. Other women, however, should not 
leave this battle to those who are exhausted from treatment or in the process 
of dying. 
</P>
<P>
The National Women's Health Network, a national organization that promotes and 
monitors women's health-care delivery in the United States, has testified at 
congressional hearings that the government must reconsider its current priority 
of funding research for treatment while ignoring research for prevention. They 
are lobbying for the resumption of a canceled study on the association between 
dietary fat and breast cancer and for a new study to explore the connections 
between breast cancer and oral contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
There are many obstacles to overcome, including those in medical training. Only 
2% of medical students take elective courses in preventive medicine; the 
academic award system rewards those who engage in basic research and technology 
development rather than those who devote themselves to prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Attention to women's health care, moreover, is sadly neglected. In 1987 the 
National Institutes of Health spent less than 14% of its $7.6-billion research 
budget on women's health issues, although women make up more than half the 
population. The General Accounting Office has reported that National Institutes 
of Health has made little progress in including women in research study 
populations, and, as a result, women's problems are not taken seriously until 
they reach a critical stage. 
</P>
<P>
Look around you. One-tenth of your sisters, daughters, wives, lovers, mothers 
and female friends (who manage to survive other life-threatening accidents or 
diseases) will, in the course of their lives, receive a diagnosis of breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for feminists, the public and politicians to grasp that breast cancer 
is a disease of epidemic proportions that affects enormous numbers of women 
and, hence, hundreds of thousands of their children, partners and friends. 
</P>
<P>
This is a silent political constituency waiting to be discovered. There is no 
greater human right than the right to live out one's natural life span.

SACRAMENTO FILE: GOVERNOR VETOES MANDATORY AIDS PREVENTION INSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jerry Gillam, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has vetoed legislation that would have required students 
in public school grades 7 to 12 to receive AIDS prevention instruction unless 
their parents objected. 
</P>
<P>
In his veto message, the governor said that he understands and appreciates the 
need for education to curb the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 
but that he does not believe the measure (AB 25) by Assemblywoman Teresa P. 
Hughes (D-Los Angeles) was needed to accomplish the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our schools are aware of the importance of this instruction," Deukmejian said, 
"and are responding appropriately without the additional programs and mandated 
local costs that this bill would create."

BASEBALL: BRAGGS' HOME RUN BEATS BRAVES, 4-2, PUTTING CINCINNATI CLOSER TO A 
DIVISION TITLE.

<P>
Glenn Braggs played detective Thursday night to move the Cincinnati Reds a step 
closer to a championship. 
</P>
<P>
Braggs deduced that a fastball was coming from Atlanta's Steve Avery, and he 
lined it for a two-run homer that put the Reds ahead to stay in a 4-2 victory 
at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's magic number was reduced to two as its National League West lead 
grew to five games over the Dodgers with six to play. The Reds have won six of 
their last seven games to put their first title in 11 years within reach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's right around the corner," Braggs said. "It seems like every day someone 
has been coming up with it. Today it's me." 
</P>
<P>
He beat the Braves with logic. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati was held to four hits through five innings by Avery (3-10), who was 
pitching with a blister on a finger of his pitching hand. He became the starter 
when Charlie Leibrandt came down with flu. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie took a 2-1 lead into the sixth inning, then walked Eric Davis. 
Braggs hit the next pitch over the wall in left-center for a 3-2 lead that 
ended Avery's outing. 
</P>
<P>
"The blister ripped open in the first," Avery said. "It really didn't bother me 
on fastballs or change-ups, but it took away my curve." 
</P>
<P>
Braggs knew it, too. "The thing I noticed him doing was throwing mostly 
fastballs," Braggs said. "We figured because of his blister, he didn't want to 
risk throwing any breaking balls. I was looking for that particular pitch, and 
he threw it -- a fastball down and away. I knew when I hit the homer that it 
was a big blow for the team and we would be on our way." 
</P>
<P>
Red starter and winner Tom Browning (15-9) had struggled since spraining his 
left ankle Aug. 17, going 2-2 in his next five starts. 
</P>
<P>
Browning gave up seven hits in the first three innings. He allowed no more hits 
through the seventh to raise his career record against Atlanta to 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble pitched two perfect innings, striking out three, for his 11th save. 
He and Browning combined to retire the last 12 in order. 
</P>
<P>
The only drawback for Cincinnati was a shoulder injury to Davis that forced him 
to leave the game in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
The left fielder slammed into the wall in foul territory after making a catch 
in the sixth, jamming his left shoulder. He rolled on the ground for several 
minutes, had the shoulder examined by trainer Larry Starr, and decided to stay 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Davis led off the bottom of the inning with a full-count walk from Avery and 
let his left arm hang limply as he rounded the bases on Braggs' homer. He was 
replaced in the top of the next inning.

CORNHUSKERS' JOSEPH ARRESTED, RELEASED

<TEXT>
<P>
Nebraska quarterback Mickey Joseph was arrested Thursday after an incident at 
the apartment of his girlfriend, police in Lincoln, Neb., said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, 22, was booked into Lancaster County Jail on suspicion of criminal 
mischief, a Class IV felony involving property damage of $300 or more, 
assistant police chief Jim Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
He was released after posting $300, 10% of a $3,000 bond, corrections officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Baird said Joseph allegedly broke an exterior window and damaged an inner 
window while trying to enter his girlfriend's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said it is his understanding that the girlfriend, 
her roommate and the apartment landlord do not wish to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said he was told Joseph was not involved in a domestic dispute and had 
gone over to his girlfriend's apartment to pick up a class syllabus. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't plan any disciplinary action at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois quarterback Jason Verduzco, who sat on a bench on the sidelines after 
being pulled from the Illini's 56-21 victory over Southern Illinois, apologized 
to the team. 
</P>
<P>
Verduzco, a sophomore who started the first three games of the season, was 
pulled from Saturday's game after SIU rolled to a 21-7 first quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Verduzco then spent the rest of the game sitting quietly on a bench, often 
looking down, as his teammates stood along the sidelines and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple of days off, and Jason has had a chance to think about 
things," Coach John Mackovic said. "He and I had a nice talk, and he talked to 
his teammates."

Reggie Moore, UCLA's senior split end, caught only 12 passes for 181 yards and 
one touchdown last year after having caught 38 for 627 yards and six touchdowns 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He is productive again, though. After three games, Moore has caught 15 passes 
for 265 yards, a 17.7 average, and two touchdowns. He ranks second in the 
Pacific 10 Conference in receiving yards per game, 88.3, and is fourth in 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Ball control has not been UCLA's strong point this season. The Bruins have 
maintained possession for 68 minutes 34 seconds in three games, compared to 
111:26 for their opponents. MAL FLORENCE

Pro Bowl cornerback Jerry Gray, who will be activated off the injured reserve 
list Monday, is fairly sure he won't be favoring the left knee he injured in 
the Rams' last exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
Because he hurt the knee in such a freakish manner, colliding with cornerback 
Alfred Jackson in the end zone after a pass, Gray said he isn't concerned about 
reinjuring it in the normal flow of a game and he should be 100% for the Rams' 
next game, Oct. 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive linemen Bill Hawkins (knee injury) and Brian Smith (injured ribs) did 
not practice Thursday, and Coach John Robinson said he will hold them out until 
next week. . . . Robinson said his best estimate is that starting inside 
linebacker Larry Kelm (knee injury) could be activated off injured reserve in 
two weeks, cornerback Darryl Henley (hip injury) in three weeks. TIM KAWAKAMI

A four-man, four-woman jury was selected to hear a landmark obscenity case 
involving the sexually explicit photographs of the late Robert Mapplethorpe. 
Defense attorneys said they hope to show jurors today the art gallery, where 
"Robert Mapplethorpe: A Perfect Moment" was on exhibit last spring in 
Cincinnati, drawing record crowds. The Contemporary Arts Center and its 
director, Dennis Barrie, were indicted on misdemeanor charges of pandering 
obscenity and using minors in nude photos the day the controversial 
retrospective opened.

A Navy deap-sea submarine searching the floor of the Pacific Ocean recovered 
part of the cargo door that last year tore away from a United Airlines 
jetliner, sweeping nine people to their deaths. National Transportation Safety 
Board officials said a preliminary examination showed that the Boeing 747 door

Wednesday in 14,100 feet of water 90 miles south-southwest of Honolulu, said a

OVERBY'S 52-YARD RUN PACES SUNNY HILLS' VICTORY OVER LOARA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With one quick burst up the middle, Sunny Hills High School running back Kenny 
Overby ended four weeks of frustration Thursday night at Spaulding Field. 
</P>
<P>
Overby raced 52 yards for a touchdown on an inside trap with 5 minutes 3 
seconds remaining in the game to break a tie and Sunny Hills went on to a 21-7 
victory over Loara. Both teams are 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Overby had the luxury of running behind one of the county's best offensive 
lines as a junior last season but he has found the pathways clogged with a new 
group of linemen in 1990. He finished with a season-high 125 yards in 22 
carries against a strong Loara defense. He later praised his blockers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just going to take some time," Overby said. "I thought our line did a 
good job of opening up some holes. It was the best game the line has played 
this season. They're good, they're just young." 
</P>
<P>
Another youngster, quarterback Hakiem McKenzie, also showed some promise in the 
victory. McKenzie completed five of nine pass attempts for 117 yards and a 
touchdown in the first half. McKenzie completed consecutive 32-yard pass plays, 
his second connecting with wide receiver Stephen Choe for Sunny Hills' first 
touchdown in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Loara relied primarily on the running of tailback Luiji Gagow to generate its 
offense. Gagow gained 97 yards in 23 carries as the Saxons rushed for 144 
yards. But Loara's inability to produce a passing attack, in addition to four 
turnovers, spelled its second defeat in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Charles Gipson threw three interceptions and Gagow had the ball 
stripped at his own 40-yard line by Sunny Hills' defensive end Jeff Hicks that 
teammate Clayton Lau turned into a 40-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Sunderland, Joey Montgomery and Choe each had an interception, and 
afterward, Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney praised his defense and the emergence 
of Overby and McKenzie. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense played great again," Devaney said. "That was a good team we beat 
tonight. I'm very pleased. I think McKenzie is starting to come into his own 
and assuming the job of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Kenny has been frustrated this year and has a tendency to get down. I was glad 
to see him get that long run. He can do that at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Loara (2-2) had limited three previous opponents to only 23 points, but the 
Saxons' tendency to self-destruct offensively was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Loara's only touchdown was set up by Shawn Easter's 35-yard punt return in the 
third quarter. Easter was starting his first game after gaining his eligibility 
this week. Easter is a transfer from Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Gipson, a converted wide receiver, completed nine of 20 pass attempts for 86 
yards and had 34 yards rushing in 11 carries. Loara has a final nonleague 
tuneup against El Modena next week, while Sunny Hills meets Esperanza.

<P>
Using the screen pass as if they had invented it, La Quinta High School's 
Aztecs rolled over Garden Grove, 27-14, Thursday night in the Garden Grove 
League opener for both teams at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret," said La Quinta Coach Roger Takahashi. "We like the screens 
and we use them." 
</P>
<P>
In a game that wasn't as close as the score indicated, the Aztecs (4-0, 1-0 in 
league) didn't waste any time going to their favorite play. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1,000 or so in attendance barely in their seats, La Quinta quarterback 
Donald Hopkins hit Walter Dawkins with a screen pass on second and eight from 
the Aztec 39-yard line, and the senior tailback ran 61 yards along the right 
sideline for the score with 8 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the first period. 
It was Hopkins' second pass of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs padded their lead to 10-0 four minutes later on a 46-yard field goal 
by Mike Berg. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the quarter, though, Garden Grove (1-3, 0-1) began to show signs 
of recovery when it marched 70 yards on 10 plays to cut the La Quinta lead to 
10-7 on a Bob Ioja one-yard run with 11:59 left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Argonauts' hopes were short-lived, however. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins, who completed 18 of 25 passes for 238 yards and two touchdowns, hooked 
up with wide receiver Dusty DePree on a 20-yard pass play with 5:51 to play in 
the quarter, and Berg added a 34-yard field goal with time running out in the 
half to increase the Aztec lead to 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded touchdowns in the second half, the Aztecs scoring on a 
five-yard run by George Sanchez in the third period and the Argonauts scoring 
late in the fourth quarter on a 25-yard pass play from backup quarterback Simon 
Fuentes to wide receiver Brian Swogger. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins, with 100 yards in five receptions, and DePree, with 77 yards in five 
catches, were the primary beneficiaries of Hopkins' passes. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec defense neutralized Garden Grove's highly touted junior tight end, 
Adrian Ioja, who caught only one pass from his brother, Bob, for an 11-yard 
gain. Bob Ioja finished the game with seven completions in 16 attempts for 106 
yards.

Edison High School continued its domination of the Huntington Beach football

</P>
<P>
Edison's Josh Gingrich threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ryan 
Blanchard with 8 minutes 31 seconds left to play and the Chargers held on for a 
16-10 victory in a Sunset League game at LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 14th time in the past 15 years Edison has beaten Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, it gave the Chargers, ranked sixth in Orange County, an early 
lead in the league race. The Chargers improved to 3-1 overall and 1-0 in league 
play while Huntington Beach, ranked fifth in the county, dropped to 3-1 and 
0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich completed four of five passes for 27 yards on the winning drive. He 
completed 17 of 35 passes overall for 157 yards with two touchdowns and three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Josh got hot a little bit in the fourth quarter when we needed him to," Edison 
Coach Dave White said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach got the ball back three times in the final eight minutes, but 
failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
Edison linebacker Mike Hawks ended the final threat with 52 seconds left when 
he intercepted a pass by Huntington Beach's Jack Friend at the Edison 31-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't throw the ball well at all," Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe 
said. "Our penalties (eight for 100 yards) were horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Edison kept the pressure on Friend the entire game, sacking him three times for 
minus-26 yards. Friend completed three of 14 passes for 19 yards and three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach tailback Joe Contreras rushed for 109 yards in 14 carries, but 
had only two carries for 21 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Contreras is really quick," White said. "He bounced a couple (of runs) on us." 
</P>
<P>
Contreras kept the Oilers moving in the first half as the teams battled to a 
10-10 halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's first-half scoring came on a safety and a nine-yard touchdown pass 
from Gingrich to Travis Balding. Gingrich then threw a two-point conversion 
pass to Rod Lippincott. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach's first-half scoring came on a 24-yard field goal by Alex 
Acocello and a four-yard run by Adam Bowermaster, who also intercepted two 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach had a chance to break the tie with 35 seconds left in the 
third quarter, but Acocello's 35-yard field-goal attempt sailed just outside 
the right upright. 
</P>
<P>
"Missing that field goal by a foot hurt us," Pascoe said. "I guess we're the 
hunter and not the huntee (in the league race). We're going to have to go after 
Edison."

EL TORO SURVIVES SLOW START

<P>
After a sluggish first half, El Toro showed why it is Orange County's 
top-ranked high school football team, cruising to a 39-7 win over Santa Monica 
Thursday night at Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's defense limited Santa Monica to 96 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers held only a 14-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Who was sluggish in the first half, Santa Monica's offense?" El Toro Coach Bob 
Johnson asked. 
</P>
<P>
In its three previous victories, El Toro outscored its opponents, 116-6. El 
Toro needed two big plays to score early against Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro scored on its first possession when quarterback Rob Johnson found 
Darren Doalson on a slant pattern for a 40-yard touchdown pass. Johnson 
completed 19 of 25 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro scored its other first-half touchdown after the Vikings' Rashon Ivy 
fumbled a punt return at the Santa Monica 25-yard line. Jason Rojas scored on 
the next play with a run up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica (1-1-1) made a threat early in the second half after defensive 
back Jim Ramming recovered a fumble by Doalson, who had caught a Johnson pass 
in the flat. Ramming ran the ball back to the El Toro 11, and one play later, 
Demarco Scott scored on a six-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"That's high school football," Johnson said. "Plays like that fumble happen; 
maybe that's what gives me gray hairs." 
</P>
<P>
After the turnover, the Chargers' offense kicked it in gear, scoring on its 
next four possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Bret Sanders, who had 79 yards in 13 carries, scored on runs of 
four and one yards.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Harbor High School scored twice in the first half and that was enough 
to hold off La Habra, 14-6, in a nonleague game Thursday night at La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor (3-1) didn't do much, however, toward derailing Jason Johnson, 
one of Orange County's leading rushers. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson gained 140 yards in 26 carries and scored the Highlanders' only 
touchdown on a 35-yard run with 8 minutes 25 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a consistent passing game offset Johnson's performance. La Habra 
(3-1) was forced to substitute Grant Mitchell at quarterback for his brother 
Greg, who injured his shoulder last week. Grant Mitchell completed only six of 
15 passes for 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's two touchdowns came in a span of a little more than a minute 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Olshefski scored on a two-yard run with 6:52 remaining to put the 
Sailors ahead, 7-0. Following an interception by Michael Stipe, the Sailors 
scored again on a 30-yard pass play from quarterback Steve Walker to tight end 
George Greenwalt. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, the teams combined to commit 15 penalties for 137 yards.

Oscar Rueda kicked a 26-yard field goal with 1 minute 9 seconds to play, giving 
Anaheim High School a 16-14 nonleague victory over Cypress Thursday night at 
Western High. 
</P>
<P>
The Colonists (1-3) had missed an opportunity to go ahead with 4:06 left when 
running back Robert Jones was stopped on a two-point conversion attempt after 
an eight-yard touchdown run by Che Garcia that had made the score 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
But linebacker Say Iemsisanith recovered a fumble by Cypress running back Bryan 
Dawson at the Centurion 24-yard line to set up the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (1-3) had taken a 14-7 lead on Dawson's five-yard run with 9:19 to 
play. Dawson scored Cypress' other touchdown on a one-yard run in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Limited to two first downs in the first half, Anaheim opened the third quarter 
with a nine-play, 61-yard drive that was capped by Garcia's 13-yard touchdown 
run. Garcia finished with 77 yards in 11 carries, all in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress quarterback Gabe Garcia completed nine of 18 passes for 151 yards to 
lead the Centurions. SCOTT JONES

The Century High School football team got its first varsity victory by 
defeating Jurupa Valley, 23-6, here Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was only fitting because Jurupa Valley, like Century, is another 
school in its first season of varsity football. 
</P>
<P>
Karlo Balderrama gave Century a first-quarter lead when he scored on a 
five-yard run. Stacy de la Motte caught a pass from Henry Ruvalcava to give

PEOPLE: PAPONE TO RETIRE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aldo Papone, chairman of American Express Travel Related Services Co., a unit 
of American Express Co., will retire Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Papone will be succeeded by two co-chairmen, Edwin M. Cooperman, president of 
the unit's North American division, and G. Richard Thoman, president of 
American Express International, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men also will serve as co-chief executives of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Papone, who has held his post since April, 1989, will become a senior adviser 
to American Express Co., reporting to Chairman James D. Robinson III. Papone 
also will continue as a director of the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
"This completes a management evolution that began almost 18 months ago when 
Aldo advised me that he would need to be less active in TRS (Travel Related 
Services) management activities for medical reasons," Robinson said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperman, an 18-year American Express veteran, is credited with increasing the 
growth of the American Express card. Thoman, an American Express executive 
since 1979, is in charge of the company's traveler's check business and its 
travel services operations outside North America, among other duties.

PEOPLE: UNION BANK CHIEF TO RESIGN NEXT MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seishichi Itoh, who headed the Bank of Tokyo's 1988 acquisition of Union Bank 
for $737 million through its California First Bank subsidiary, will resign next 
month as Union Bank's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Itoh, 55, will leave the San Francisco bank to return to Japan to take an 
unspecified assignment with Bank of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
His leaving is no surprise, and in line with the Japanese management style in 
which top executives are rotated every few years. 
</P>
<P>
Taisuke Shimizu, 54, the bank's vice chairman and chief financial officer, will 
replace Itoh. Shimizu's position will be filled by Kanetaka Yoshida, 52. 
</P>
<P>
Union, the state's fifth-largest commercial bank, is 77% owned by Bank of 
Tokyo. The bank today is an outgrowth of the combination of the former Union 
Bank in Los Angeles and California First Bank in San Francisco, which Itoh had 
headed since 1983.

DOW DROPS 32 POINTS TO HIT A 16-MONTH LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks prices fell to a 16-month low Thursday as oil prices continued their 
relentless drive toward $40 a barrel, feeding fears that the nation's economy 
is dangerously unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's decision to sell crude from the U.S. strategic reerve proved 
powerless against the upward trend in oil prices, causing stocks to tumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.17 points, or 1.3%, at 
2,427.48, after a 25.99-point decline suffered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was heavy, with Big Board volume totaling 182.7 million shares, 
compared to 155.6 million Wednesday. In the broader market, losing issues 
outnumbered gaining ones by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,182 down, 395 up and 422 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The brunt of the selling pressure was focused on banks, which have been faced 
with mounting problem loans in the depressed real estate industry. Bank of 
Boston cut its dividend and announced major layoffs, adding to Wall Street 
fears that further cutbacks may be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the quarter coming, no one wants to have anything in their 
portfolio that has anything related to financial services," said Tom Callahan, 
executive vice president at Yamaichi International. 
</P>
<P>
Although the market started out on a strong note as oil prices dipped, crude 
prices quickly advanced on news that the U.S. Navy had fired shots across the 
bow of an Iraqi tanker. Oil for November delivery closed 87 cents higher at 
$39.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
As the market mood soured, the Dow industrials fell more than 50 points, 
triggering the NYSE's limit on computer-aided trading, known as index 
arbitrage. The ban was lifted late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow managed to recoup ground but still ended at its lowest point since May 
11, 1989, when the index closed at 2,382.88. 
</P>
<P>
Poor market fundamentals have led many investment managers to sell equities. 
Kenneth Gerbino, head of the investment firm that bears his name, said 
investors "should remain in cash and some gold stocks." 
</P>
<P>
"The level of skepticism about the market's ability to hold together is still 
very high," said Hugh Johnson of First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of nervousness that a hot war will break out in the Gulf," he 
said. "If it does, the release of oil from the reserves will not keep prices 
low." 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Banking stocks were a major focus. Bank of Boston fell 3/8 to 7 1/8; 
Continental Bank Corp. was off 5/8 to 7 3/8; Manufacturers Hanover fell 1 to 20 
1/4; Citicorp lost 3/4 to 13 3/4; BankAmerica lost 3/4 to 19 1/4, and Chase 
Manhattan fell 1/8 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
* The bearish mood spread to other financial issues as well. American 
International fell 3/4 to 59 3/4, Unum Corp. lost 2 7/8 to 38 1/4 and General 
Reinsurance was down 1 1/2 to 70 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Among other issues, Union Carbide, which said it would repurchase up to 14% 
of its outstanding shares, rose 5/8 to 14 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Computer company Unisys dropped 1 5/8 to 5 3/8. It suspended its dividend and 
said it expects a third-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
* Among other actively traded Big Board issues, General Electric was down 3 3/8 
at 51 5/8; MCA was down 2 1/4 at 59; IBM was down 1 at 104 3/8 and Philip 
Morris was down 5/8 at 44. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices sank to 33-month lows on the Tokyo Stock Exchange with 
the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average losing 478.71 points, or 2.15%, to close at 
21,771.91 points, its lowest finish since Jan. 4, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed higher on London's stock exchange but well under the day's 
best level, as a technical rally faded following a drop on Wall Street. The 
Financial Times 100-share index closed up 9.1 points to close at 2,009.1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bonds Rally on Hope of Budget Accord 
</P>
<P>
The bond market staged a powerful rally, fueled by technical forces and hopes 
that agreement on cutting the federal deficit will lead to lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The widely watched 30-year Treasury bond surged 1.063 point, or more than $10 
for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when the price goes up, 
tumbled to 9.02% from 9.12% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the buying reflected technical maneuvers as traders sought to 
accumulate bonds to compensate for past sales. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Napolitano, market strategist at R. C. Government Securities, said the 
short-covering rally didn't really stem from a significant change in sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"The market had been deeply oversold for a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Renewed optimism that stalemated budget negotiations in Washington will soon 
yield an accord on reducing the deficit helped to encourage bond buyers, 
Napolitano said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.063%, down from 8.125% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Tumbles but Gains Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar weakened against all major currencies except the Japanese yen, which 
remained pressured by the rising oil prices and another sharp decline on the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said trading was slow and in a broad range in the absence of 
any fundamental news. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has no clear direction and it probably won't until the budget 
situation is resolved and something happens in the Middle East," said Earl I. 
Johnson, a vice president and dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"(The market) is being constantly buffeted by rumors." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the dollar was hurt by speculation of a budget compromise in 
Washington but supported by rumors of escalating tensions between the United 
States and Iraq in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained ground against the yen everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency finished at 1.5610 German marks, down from Wednesday's 
1.5660, and at 137.98 Japanese yen, up from 136.855 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar weakened against the British pound. Sterling rose to $1.8690 from 
$1.8635 in London, and to $1.8780 from $1.8718 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Gold Joins Silver, Platinum in Slide 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices reversed a three-day trend and tumbled despite modest gains in 
crude oil prices as speculators began to re-establish gold's traditional role 
in the market. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, silver and platinum extended their losses; energy 
futures rose slightly; wheat and soybean futures were mostly higher; meat 
futures were higher and corn was lower. 
</P>
<P>
Gold had continued to rise this week despite the fact that silver and platinum 
-- which the gold market usually follows -- plummeted to their lowest levels in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $1.90 to $2.20 lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the 
contract for delivery in September at $405 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Silver and platinum extended their losses following weak economic activity in 
the United States, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>

'TEXASVILLE': MIDLIFE CRISES;

<P>
FILM: IN THE SEQUEL TO 'THE LAST PICTURE SHOW,' DIRECTOR PETER BOGDANOVICH'S 
HOMECOMING IS A BOON AND A BUST.

In the opening of "Texasville" (selected theaters), Jeff Bridges' Duane 
Jackson, in his hot tub, is shooting indifferently at his new two-story 
doghouse with a .44 Magnum. Lord knows Duane's got acreage enough so that he 
won't hit anything he doesn't mean to, but it's a signal that all is not well 
in Anarene, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
There's very little right -- or even comprehensible -- with other "Texasville" 
characters either, many of whom audiences will remember from "The Last Picture 
Show" which traced their lives some 30 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Between then and "Texasville's" 1984, the oil boom and bust have hit Anarene. 
Both cataclysmic events have spawned some pretty peculiar behavior. Ordinary 
townspeople who'd expected to live "more or less orderly, more or less 
responsible lives," can be found whirling in and out of each other's beds or 
pickup trucks, on the edge of what seems to be widespread nervous collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Underneath all this irrational behavior is oil-driven anxiety; more than half 
the town is bankrupt, the other half expects to be before sundown. 
Unfortunately, that was far clearer -- and funnier -- in Larry McMurtry's book 
than in Peter Bogdanovich's film. Director-screenwriter Bogdanovich has crowded 
the screen with so much activity and so many auxiliary characters that we're 
pushed well past the point of keeping track of them -- or caring. 
</P>
<P>
We want to know about Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), back home to heal her 
soul. Has she got Duane in her sights again or is she simply exercising her 
talent for lazy flirtation? What should we make of her instant closeness with 
Karla (Annie Potts), Duane's terrific wife of 20 years? 
</P>
<P>
To find out, we have to fight our way through a welter of glossy Texas women 
who are sleeping with either Duane or his 19-year-old son Dickie (William 
McNamara), or with both. And there are these women's gun-totin' husbands. If 
you think of them as gnats, you'll have an easier time of it. 
</P>
<P>
For audiences too young to remember the 1971 "Picture Show," Bogdanovich may 
have skimped on some needed refreshers, especially about Sonny (Timothy 
Bottoms), whose performance doesn't really register. Over these 30 years, Duane 
has become a husband, a father, a millionaire and a very young grandfather. But 
we meet him $12 million in debt and unsettled by that idea, by middle age and 
by the behavior of every woman around him, including his wife's. 
</P>
<P>
Jacy, Duane's capricious high-school sweetheart, has gone on to become a minor 
movie star. She's come back to Anarene from Italy where she's been living, 
wracked by a death in her family. Bachelor Sonny Crawford, Duane's best buddy 
and rival for Jacy in high school, is fraying at the seams; as Duane says, 
"Sonny's a little tired in his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid), now an overstressed bank president and Genevieve 
Morgan (Eileen Brennan) are on screen only briefly. Only Ruth Popper (Cloris 
Leachman, particularly fine) seems to have traversed the time-span 
successfully. Once the older woman in an adulterous affair with Sonny, she's 
been widowed for years and Duane's secretary through thick and thin. 
</P>
<P>
"Texasville's" problem isn't that its tone is darker and more reflective. It's 
that unhappiness and inertia aren't particularly dramatic and mindless 
partner-swapping isn't particularly engaging. "The Last Picture Show's" 
high-schoolers, facing the Korean War, were groping for sex as avidly as these 
adults; they were also groping for tenderness and human contact. "Texasville's" 
adults seem to be simply groping, although not in ways that warrant the film's 
R rating. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's grace rests with the performances of Bridges, Potts and Shepherd. 
Thirty pounds pudgier for the part, Bridges' Duane, like most McMurtry men, is 
baffled and buffaloed by the tart-tongued women around him. The sight of Jacy 
and his wife -- mysterious and allied -- with their heads together, most likely 
comparing notes about his defects, makes Duane real edgy. 
</P>
<P>
Potts' Karla, mother of four hell-raising kids, is a pistol. Karla's been 
putting her feisty messages to the world -- "You Can't Be First -- But You Can 
Be Next" -- where the world can't fail to notice them, on her black, sprayed-on 
T-shirts. Duane's desultory affairs don't thrill her, but she's in for the long 
haul, clearly Duane's match and the motor of their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Burnished by time and the loss she's suffered, Shepherd's Jacy is still a 
heartbreaker, wicked enough to seduce Duane's very own dog away from him. Her 
devastating closing scene, watching Duane and Karla's twins simply being kids, 
is an announcement of how far Jacy -- and Shepherd -- have come. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the movie's big set-piece, the Old Texasville Centennial, which 
should contain a certain visual irony about the New West, is endless and 
cartoony. Like Sonny's moving pictures in his mind, Bogdanovich sees things we 
can't; when we can join him -- in moments of family and connectedness -- 
"Texasville" is touching. Most other times it's the darndest mess you ever saw.

LITTLE ECSTASY OVER 'ECSTATIC ORANGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York City Ballet faces a most ingenious paradox. 
</P>
<P>
When the company concentrates on the legacy of George Balanchine, it threatens 
to become a museum. Given the vagaries of choreographic recollection and 
transmission, it may not even be a good museum. 
</P>
<P>
When, on the other hand, the company tries to expand the repertory, it reminds 
us all too painfully that Balanchine is gone. There has been no second coming. 
Comparisons are deadly. 
</P>
<P>
All this was brought into awkward focus Wednesday night at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. Peter Martins, the official keeper of the City Ballet 
flame, served a Martins sandwich. His own "Ecstatic Orange" functioned as the 
central substance with Balanchine staples used as bread. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness for the bread. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't turn out to be gourmet bread. One has to be grateful these days, 
however, for any sort of nourishment. 
</P>
<P>
The bill opened with "Mozartiana," the 1981 masterpiece in which Balanchine 
paid homage on the stage to his muse of the moment, Suzanne Farrell, while 
Tchaikovsky paid homage in the pit to Wolfgang Amadeus. This is a ballet 
stamped with a specific ballerina's persona. 
</P>
<P>
Other dancers have followed bravely in Farrell's unique footsteps. Darci 
Kistler, again on the injured list, has enjoyed considerable success in the 
role. So, for that matter, has Kyra Nichols, who inherited the daunting honors 
on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
She is a lovely dancer, and she performed here with fine clarity, artfully 
disguised strength and dedication that bordered on reverence. She conveyed the 
awe of the initial Preghiera with simple restraint, and she mastered the 
complexities of the Theme and Variations with virtuosic ease. 
</P>
<P>
The ease may have been the problem. Nichols never seemed to be taking chances, 
never seemed to be flirting with danger. She knew what she was doing, and she 
did it neatly. 
</P>
<P>
One longed -- unfairly, perhaps -- for Farrell's rapturous abandon, not to 
mention the uncanny sense of spontaneity she conveyed, even when it may have 
been premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
Damian Woetzel partnered Nichols with forceful generosity and executed his 
solos with a compelling fusion of all-American nonchalance and Soviet-style 
bravura. If it weren't for the horror of the pun, one might say that his career 
has progressed in leaps and bounds since his teen-age debut with the Los 
Angeles Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Gen Horiuchi darted through the quirky little Gigue with cheeky aplomb. Gordon 
Boelzner and the imported orchestra provided an uncommonly sympathetic musical 
impetus. 
</P>
<P>
"Vienna Waltzes," which closed the program, found Balanchine striking trivial, 
almost kitschy attitudes in 1977. Luckily, the trivia is discerning and the 
kitsch lofty. 
</P>
<P>
This sentimental melange fuses nostalgic ballroom manners and mannerisms -- the 
ballerinas wear heels -- with subtle accents of classical ritual. The score 
ranges from Johann to Richard Strauss, with detours for an operettic Lehar 
divertissement and a springy little polka anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
The modest set by Rouben Ter-Arutunian earned applause from the near-capacity 
audience, possibly because it was the only set seen all evening. The designer 
managed to adorn the stage with some wispy trees that eventually disappeared in 
favor of a glitzy Jugendstil salon. 
</P>
<P>
The five central couples, all deft but few inspired, swayed and swirled with 
traces of lilting pathos. On occasion, they even did so with wilting charm. 
Still, one had to wonder -- sacrilegiously, of course -- how long such a chic 
jeu d'esprit would have survived in the repertory if the author had been named 
Arpino rather than Balanchine. One also had to wonder if the performance would 
have revealed greater definition of character if Mr. B were still lurking in 
the wings. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Calegari, suavely complemented by Adam Luders, brought sweet delicacy to 
the role Suzanne Farrell used to fill with mysterious yearning. Judith Fugate 
and Robert LaFosse glittered nicely in their dapper duet. Valentina Kozlova, 
courted compellingly by Otto Neubert, oozed sophistication in the fashionable 
poses of the potentially merry widow. 
</P>
<P>
In the pit, Hugo Fiorito tended appreciatively to the hesitant beats of 
three-quarter time in Alt Wien. 
</P>
<P>
Martins' "Ecstatic Orange," first performed in 1987, isn't ecstatic, and it 
certainly doesn't move like clockwork. It is a frenzied, brutal three-part 
exercise in which the muscular Jock Soto spends a lot of time and wastes a lot 
of perspiration tying the wiry Heather Watts in clumsy knots. 
</P>
<P>
The ballet isn't even orange any more. Mark Stanley has abandoned the obvious 
light cues that used to illustrate the title, presumably inspired by Michael 
Torke's trashy-thumpy score. Black and white abstractions are now the key. 
</P>
<P>
The model for this flashy neo-aerobic indulgence with sadomasochistic 
undertones would seem to lie in one of Balanchine's Stravinsky ballets. But 
Martins diverts the nervous energy in fussy maneuvers that lack both focus and 
direction. The formula rhythms chug nowhere. The choreographer seems to filter 
the inherent ferocity through disco sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The leotarded dancers give their all. They even manage to hint at lyricism 
beneath the trendy violence of the second -- "Green" -- movement. They try 
desperately, occasionally with success, to make gymnastic torture look 
aesthetic as well as athletic. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the folks at MTV do this sort of thing better.

RAITT'S TRANSITION TO A BALLADEER FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's a long way from Trancas, right here," said Bonnie Raitt, opening a 
three-night stand on Wednesday at the Universal Amphitheatre, referring not 
just to the geographical distance from the tiny Malibu nightclub where she was 
resigned to squeezing 'em in with a shoehorn not all that long ago, on the 
downside of her career. 
</P>
<P>
That was pre-comeback, pre-Grammys, pre-"Nick of Time," of course. A veteran 
singer/guitarist with a good character, a smart mouth, a sexy walk, nimble 
fingers and a dignified, self-respecting attitude, Raitt is too little the 
Cinderella-complex type to allow for any fairy-tale analogies. ("I can find my 
own diamond ring!" she playfully barked at a wayward suitor in "Real Man.") 
</P>
<P>
Still, this triumphant homecoming at the end of a long tour had the flavor of, 
at least, the epilogue to a feel-good TV movie, if not the happily-ever-after 
denouement for a bedtime success story. 
</P>
<P>
The transition from outdated '70s blues-rock mama to essential '90s balladeer 
seemed complete, not least of all because Raitt has held firmly onto her blues 
roots, but without staying in that place of arrested development that is 
sometimes part and parcel with maintaining a blues attitude. 
</P>
<P>
She still growls out a fine "Sugar Mama" and "Give It Up or Let Me Go" -- and 
you can trace an obvious line between the cocky defiance of those blues numbers 
and the quiet assurance of her ballads. 
</P>
<P>
But those older songs, fun as they are, seem distinctly like performances. The 
songs Raitt really inhabits now are newer, softer, more mature statements of 
purpose like Bonnie Hayes' "Have a Heart," her own "Nick of Time" and David 
Lasley's "I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again," the last of which, she 
said, "I waited a long time to be grown-up enough to sing." 
</P>
<P>
The musical and thematic arc of her well-constructed show was cleverly 
reflected in the set design, a vista of desert buttes with a skyline backdrop. 
The early portion of the set focused on good-time, up-tempo numbers from the 
span of her career, the ruddy sky behind Raitt gradually darkening. 
</P>
<P>
The nighttime segment, with starry sky and rising moon, encompassed tender 
ballads like "Louise" as well as blues numbers with a rootsier, scaled-down 
version of her group that she introduced as "the back porch band." And the 
sunrise, aided and abetted by a morning thunderstorm, commenced with a couple 
of light but rousing rockers from her latest and most popular album. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to say whether Raitt's stage presence is enabled more by her fine 
slide guitar playing or her good humor and strong rapport. In any case, she 
went out of her way to credit almost all the songwriters responsible for the 
evening's material, from mentor Mississippi Fred McDowell to herself ("Here's 
one of my tunes, since I qualify as an old blueswoman now," she quipped during 
the "back porch" segment). 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps most admirable and endearing was the moment in which she marveled 
at how far she'd come career-wise, and then went on to emphatically reinforce 
that, however happy she was about her comeback, it was not the factor behind 
her personal recovery and happiness, which predated the chart/award success. In 
other words, when it comes to the fickle pop audience, she's co-dependent no 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Raitt's set hadn't been half so spirited, she'd have been worthy of a 
standing ovation just for her inspired choice of opening acts on the tour -- 
smooth "Sequoia of soul" Charles Brown and the utterly unpeggable, certifiably 
commitable NRBQ. 
</P>
<P>
Brown may be the only singer alive who can refer to himself in the third person 
more than Jerry Lee Lewis yet still come off as humble. Accompanying himself on 
piano and joined gradually by members of Raitt's band, Brown crooned his way 
through a slew of forgotten classics. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran quartet NRBQ plays a kind of barroom rock that sounds messy but is, in 
fact, quite jazzy and sporadically brilliant, with sweet, boy-like lyrics and 
somewhat maniacal on-stage attitude. They're either the Beach Boys of the '90s 
or the Replacements of the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
So don't be late if you plan to see Raitt, Brown and NRBQ finish up their 
Universal stint with a sold-out show tonight, or their tour-capper on Sunday 
night at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.

Pat Robertson vs. Puppeteer: Evangelist Pat Robertson charged Thursday that a 
children's puppet show featuring simulated oral sex was performed last week at 
an Atlanta arts festival allegedly subsidized by the National Endowment for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the puppet show, performed at the Atlanta Arts Festival last 
Friday before 800 people, including children, featured "approximately five 
minutes of simulated foreplay between two puppets followed by an exhibit of 
oral sex acts." His Christian Coalition in Chesapeake, Va., responded by 
generating 27,000 petitions demanding that the NEA be abolished and sending 
them Tuesday to every member of Congress. Robertson's claims were vigorously 
denied by the NEA, the Georgia state arts council and puppeteer Jon Ludwig of 
Atlanta. GREG BRAXTON

ABT After Baryshnikov: American Ballet Theatre's plans for its 1990-91 season 
include replacing three stagings by former artistic director Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, who withdrew rights to his works when he quit abruptly last year 
in an angry dispute with current co-director Jane Hermann. In place of the 
Baryshnikov versions formerly in the repertory, ABT has commissioned a new 
staging of the full-length "Don Quixote" (from Bolshoi luminary Vladimir 
Vasiliev), a new suite of "Raymonda" excerpts (from dancer Fernando Bujones) 
and a restaging of the full-length "Giselle" (from someone not yet announced).

KGB Loses Nights at the Opera: The KGB may lose its prime seats at Moscow's 
Bolshoi Theater, a new blow to the prestige of the security agency now under 
attack as a relic of the authoritarian past. The theater's management has 
demanded closing of a "special zone" set aside for top Soviet officials and 
controlled by the KGB, the youth daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said Thursday. The 
Bolshoi's director told the newspaper removing the government boxes -- the 
former czar's loge in the center and two to one side -- would make way for 60 
additional seats. GREG BRAXTON

If anybody is going to pry M.C. Hammer out of the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 
chart, where he's been camped for 17 weeks, it's George Michael, whose new 
album bolted up to No. 5 in only two weeks. Michael's single, "Praying for 
Time," is No. 2 on the pop singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
Country singer Garth Brooks' "No Fences" continues to shoot up the chart, 
landing at No. 23 after just three weeks -- a remarkable performance for an 
album by a relative unknown, particularly an unknown in the country genre. Maxi 
Priest's "Close to You" is the new No. 1 pop single. 
</P>
<P>
* Probably the raunchiest, most sexist rap albums in the business are made by 
Too Short, who makes some of the more celebrated X-rated rappers seem tame. But 
"Short Dog's in the House" is one of the hottest albums on the chart, jumping 
to No. 28 in just two weeks.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: O'TOTO: NO ECLECTIC WANNA-BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA

<TEXT>
<P>
More adventures in eclecticism: goat cheese flan with a smidge of grilled 
Japanese eggplant; ravioli filled with a puree of butternut squash, fontina 
cheese and nasturtium petals. This may be the stuff of California cuisine in 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the newly opened O'toto -- the Zen-minimalist space was blessed 
by a Buddhist monk -- and its chef, Jeanette Holley, the cultural mix-and-match 
game mostly makes sense. Unlike most eclectic wanna-bes, Holley, who was raised 
in Japan and Korea, seems to understand the Asian cuisines that influence much 
of her food. She doesn't clutter up dishes with a lot of ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
In her take on the classic Thai papaya salad, she uses fresh shrimp instead of 
dried, and she tones down the chile. Her version is more a salad than a 
drinking snack. At lunch, there's an interesting-sounding salad made with fried 
chicken, black-eyed peas and hush puppies. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything works -- O'toto is still very new. One brave choice that does: 
simmered beef tongue with epazote black beans. 
</P>
<P>
 O'toto, 7119 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 937-5435. Entree prices, 
$7.95-$16.

A BITTERSWEET TANGERINE: PRICES RISE AS NIGHT FALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tangerine is an arty place. For one thing, it's a block east of the Los Angeles 
County Art Museum. And the first thing one encounters upon entering the 
restaurant is art . . . very big art. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I went to Tangerine it was lunchtime. Almost all the tables were 
filled, mostly with people from nearby offices, shops and museums. I found my 
friend, Tom, already seated in his plastic chair. He greeted me with a deep 
look and a single word: "Ando." It was clearly a clue. 
</P>
<P>
I looked around the very large, rectangular dining room. Hanging on Tangerine's 
very high white walls, under its black ceiling and exposed ducts and girders, 
there were big paintings. Some were of cartoony faces in bright colors, but 
these were overshadowed by some really huge abstract paintings. One was in a 
pointy, swirly shape; one was in the shape of a gargantuan bow-tie; and one was 
conventionally rectangular and big as a billboard. 
</P>
<P>
They were very loud. All the abstractions were made with a lot of paint, 
hundreds, if not thousands of dollars worth of paint, most of which was 
metallic. There was, in fact, so much paint that the canvas surfaces had 
cracked in places to look like metallic mud flats, acres of them. I couldn't 
help but think it's a good thing paintings can't literally jump off the walls 
at people because here at Tangerine, one wouldn't survive the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Ando" was still a mystery, so I checked out the menu. On it were a lot of 
eclectic Pacific Rim dishes -- pastas, satays, salsas, teriyakis and a Caesar 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
We started with some vegetable rolls, finger-sized, deep-fried packets that 
looked pretty unimpressive, but tasted quite good. They got even better when 
dipped in the plum and pink peppercorn sauce that came with them. We also had 
some juicy and tasty chicken satay with a rich peanut sauce. Tom had the Thai 
salad special, spicy sliced steak on a bed of great varied greens, and I had 
the special ravioli, large plump pillows of pasta stuffed with a pleasantly 
bland ground chicken in a lovely soft tomato sauce. When we ordered coffee, the 
waiter did such a good selling job we ended up getting two desserts -- and an 
additional $11 on our bill. The raspberry cheesecake was light and creamy in an 
unexpectedly pleasurable manner. The apple tart in caramel sauce was just OK. 
Our bill, with tip, for this larger-than-average lunch, came to just under $50. 
Still, no "Ando." 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, I returned to Tangerine for dinner, after calling well in 
advance for reservations. As it turned out, reservations weren't all that 
necessary. Tangerine was much quieter than it had been for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch, Tangerine's food was imaginative and fun, if a bit high-priced. At 
dinner, the prices went higher. Frankly, they were too high for the casual kind 
of place Tangerine aspires to be. ("Jeans are encouraged," I was told on the 
phone, after a friend insisted I ask about the dress code at dinner.) A New 
York steak at lunch was $14.50; at dinner it was $19. And it wasn't $4.50 
better, either. The creme brulee we had for dessert was worth $5.50. But this 
kind of pricing puts Tangerine smack in the ranks of Los Angeles' 
moderate-to-expensive restaurants. Tangerine's day customers would probably be 
shocked to know their casual lunch spot turns into an expensive restaurant at 
night. But our dinner, with tip, came to just over $90 without any alcoholic 
beverages -- a steep price for food served on plastic plates. 
</P>
<P>
As I was leaving Tangerine, I took one last look around the room. That's when I 
spotted it. In the lower right hand corner of Tangerine's big rectangular 
painting was a word written backwards in red graffiti. If mirrored the word 
would read "Ando." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," I said. "The artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Tangerine, 5767 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 933-3838. Open 
Monday-Saturday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. All major credit cards accepted. Beer and 
wine. Dinner for two, food only, $35 to $65.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE PROBING 3 RAPES AT USC IN LAST 10 
DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are investigating the rapes of three USC students in the last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The three attacks occurred at the homes of the alleged victims near the Central 
Los Angeles campus and may have been committed by the same man, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent assault, police said the attacker broke into an apartment on 
West 30th Street about 2:20 a.m. Wednesday and raped two student roommates. On 
Sept. 17, a man fitting the same general description opened a sliding glass 
door and entered a woman student's apartment on Shrine Place, police said. He 
raped the woman and stole a small amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
The man apparently was not armed during the attacks but threatened his victims 
with further injury. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to release a detailed description of the suspect, but Police 
Cmdr. William Booth said he expected an arrest to be made soon.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PCP LAB EXPLODES, IGNITING HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A PCP lab in a Windsor Hills house exploded early Thursday, ripping doors and 
windows from their casements and igniting a fire that burned the back of the 
house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the 3:30 a.m. explosion in the 4900 block of 
Chesley Avenue, Sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom said. The house sustained extensive 
damage, but there was no immediate dollar estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Benny Childs Jr. 49, and Sherree McNeil, 43, were booked on suspicion of 
possession of a controled substance with intent to distribute. Sheriff's Sgt.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR ACTOR COREY 
FELDMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An arrest warrant was issued Thursday for actor Corey Feldman, who failed to 
appear in court for one of his two heroin cases because he has enrolled in a 
live-in drug rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer held the bench warrant until Oct. 31, when 
Feldman, 19, is to again appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, the star of such movies as "Stand by Me," "The Goonies" and "The Lost 
Boys," will not be arrested unless he fails to show up then. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Richard Hirsch, said Feldman did not appear for Thursday's pretrial 
hearing because he has enrolled in the 30-day live-in program. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman enrolled in the program after his arrest last week during which police 
in North Hollywood found packets of heroin in his socks while the actor was 
sitting in a car whose rear window was smashed. Feldman is to be arraigned 
Monday on a heroin charge stemming from that arrest.

YOM KIPPUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most solemn day on the Jewish calendar is Yom Kippur (yome kih-POOR). The 
Day of Atonement, which will be observed this year from sundown today to 
sundown Saturday, concludes the 10 High Holy Days of self-scrutiny and 
repentance. 
</P>
<P>
* TRADITION: According to rabbinical accounts, it is the day on which Moses 
came down from Mt. Sinai with the second set of Commandment tablets and 
announced God's pardon of the people for worshiping a golden calf. Mentioned in 
the biblical book of Leviticus (23:26-32) along with other holy days, Yom 
Kippur has come to be observed as a day of fasting, rest, meditation and prayer 
for God's forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
* OBSERVANCES: Religious Jews will excuse themselves from their workplaces 
during the 24-hour period of Yom Kippur. Synagogue services tonight will 
feature the Kol Nidre recitations, which start with the cancellation of all 
unfulfilled promises to God made rashly or unwittingly during the previous 
year. Synagogues will be at their fullest for a series of daytime services 
Saturday; members have made their reservations far in advance, but some temples 
will have unassigned seating. Rites end with the sounding of the shofar, a 
ram's horn, and the traditional prayer, "Next year in Jerusalem."

'NEA FOUR' SUIT SEEKS REJECTED GRANT FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: PERFORMANCE ARTISTS SAY THEY WERE DENIED NATIONAL GRANTS FOR POLITICAL 
REASONS. ONE SEEKS DAMAGES FOR VIOLATION OF PRIVACY. 
</P>

<P>
Four performance artists denied National Endowment for the Arts fellowships on 
what they say are political grounds filed suit Thursday in Los Angeles federal 
court seeking an order overruling the grant rejections. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the four said they would also file a petition for a temporary 
restraining order today that would bar the arts endowment from spending the 
$23,000 earmarked for the fellowships until the dispute is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The performers -- Karen Finley and Holly Hughes, both of New York, John Fleck 
of Los Angeles and Tim Miller of Santa Monica -- have become known as the "NEA 
Four" in arts circles. 
</P>
<P>
Their work is highly political. All but Finley are gay and include homosexual 
and lesbian themes prominently in their work, which has received broad critical 
acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Finley's performances are stridently feminist in tone. She has appeared on 
stage partially clothed, her body smeared with melted chocolate and alfalfa 
sprouts to symbolize denigration of women by forcing them to wallow in 
excrement and sperm. 
</P>
<P>
Finley and Miller previously had received numerous NEA grants. 
</P>
<P>
The plight of the four attracted national attention last summer when NEA 
Chairman John E. Frohnmayer overruled the unanimous vote of a grant-review 
panel and rejected the fellowships. The decision was made after Frohnmayer 
reportedly told a meeting of arts activists that the NEA's precarious political 
situation necessitated denial of the grants. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment currently faces battles in Congress to secure renewal of its 
legislative franchise and appropriations for the 1991 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which was assigned to U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, 
seeks an order compelling Frohnmayer to reconsider the rejections on grounds 
that the fellowships were denied for reasons other than questions about the 
performers' artistic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer sacrificed the artists "because of the controversial political 
content of their work," according to the complaint. "He did so with the aim of 
suppressing the expression of plaintiffs' ideas." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA has declined to give reasons for the grant rejections. And Frohnmayer 
turned down appeals of his decision by the artists earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The furor over the fellowship denials has made the four artists -- and Finley, 
in particular -- heroes within the arts community and prominent players in the 
continuing drama over the NEA's political future. 
</P>
<P>
The action, filed by attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, was 
undertaken by a consortium of five arts attorneys assembled by the National 
Campaign for Freedom of Expression, an activist artist group. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asked for an additional $50,000 in damages to Finley, whose privacy 
rights were violated, the complaint charged, by an alleged NEA leak to 
conservative columnists of her confidential NEA grant application. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA, which has a budget of $171.5 million this year, gives grants to 
artists and arts institutions nationwide. Its political turmoil began in April, 
1989, with a controversy over NEA support of two exhibits containing 
controversial photographs. One of those, a show of work by photographer Robert 
Mapplethorpe, is currently the subject of a state court obscenity prosecution 
in Cincinnati.

SIGNS OKD TO WARN SWIMMERS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: POSTINGS WILL BE MADE NEAR THE MOUTH OF AT LEAST EIGHT STORM 
DRAINS THAT FLOW INTO SANTA MONICA BAY. AGREEMENT ENDED MONTHS OF DEBATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After months of debate between environmentalists and county health officials, a 
committee directing cleanup of Santa Monica Bay has recommended posting signs 
warning swimmers not to "swim or play" near storm drain water. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project management committee -- a coalition of 
government, business and environmental groups -- agreed on the wording for the 
signs at its monthly meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said signs should be posted near the mouth of at least eight 
storm drains -- stretching from Malibu to Redondo Beach -- that flow year-round 
into the bay. The recommendation to the county and cities that own the drains 
does not say how far swimmers should stay from the outlets. 
</P>
<P>
The bay cleanup committee will vote next month whether to jazz up the signs -- 
perhaps using foreign languages and symbols -- to make sure that the warnings 
are not ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestions for increasing the impact of the signs have ranged from the 
aggressive -- a skull and crossbones -- to the benign -- a friendly message 
from television cartoon star Bart Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote was a compromise between the wishes of county officials and 
environmental groups such as Heal the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Health Services had argued for several months that it 
is not proper to post signs declaring a health risk without proof that the 
runoff from city streets makes swimmers sick. 
</P>
<P>
"If we post the signs, it puts us in an untenable position," said Jack 
Petralia, the county's director of environmental protection before the 
compromise. "We haven't identified any known risk. There is no justification 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists said it is better to post the signs until the health 
impacts of the storm waters are clear. 
</P>
<P>
Calls for warning signs intensified in July, when the city of Santa Monica 
banned swimming within 100 yards of a storm drain below Pico Boulevard after 
the discovery that the drain was polluted with sewage. Sewage in ocean water 
has been proven to cause stomach flu and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
County officials agreed to post signs as long as they do not mention specific 
health risks and are placed only on drains that flow in summer and winter. 
</P>
<P>
The county officials said those limitations are important because the public 
could be unduly alarmed or desensitized by the posting of the more than 60 
drains that empty into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the county Department of Beaches and Harbors noted that beaches 
already have so many signs -- warning against littering, marking surf zones and 
prohibiting fishing in some areas -- that the public does not pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the recommendation to post signs reading: "This is storm drain 
water. Do not play or swim in or near it." 
</P>
<P>
The drains recommended for posting are Malibu Creek, Santa Monica Canyon, Pico 
Boulevard, Ashland Avenue in Santa Monica, Ballona Creek in Marina del Rey, 
Imperial Highway in Playa del Rey, Herondo Street in Redondo Beach and Avenue I 
in Redondo Beach.

STAND ON THEATER ALTERED AFTER $10,000 GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks before it abruptly dropped its opposition last spring to the 
demolition of one of downtown's oldest theaters, the region's most influential 
preservation group got a $10,000 contribution from the father of the building's 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by criticism after disclosure of the donation, Los Angeles Conservancy 
leaders have had to fend off suggestions that a deal was struck with the owners 
of the California Theater who sought its demolition to make way for a parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
The 1918 movie palace on Main Street, with a two-story beaux-arts facade styled 
after the Paris Opera, is being torn down. A final bid to save it stalled in 
August before a city panel -- in large part, some preservationists assert, 
because the Conservancy withdrew support for making it a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy, a private nonprofit group with 6,000 members and a $500,000 
annual budget, often acts as an unofficial adviser to the city on preservation 
issues and is regarded as a major voice in influencing what sites are 
considered for protected landmark status. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy leaders say the close timing of the withdrawal of their landmark 
support and businessman Jack Needleman's $10,000 donation -- the biggest 
individual gift in the 12-year-old group's history -- was nothing more than an 
"unfortunate" coincidence. Needleman's sons own the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the group's board of directors on Monday ordered the development 
of a formal fund-raising policy to provide "safeguards against acceptance of 
donations constituting the appearance or actuality of a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that "questions have been raised," the group's executive 
committee said it had "reviewed the full history of our involvement with the 
California Theater, and is satisfied that no improprieties have occurred." 
</P>
<P>
But some local preservationists say they remain troubled. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the timing of the donation," said Rory Cunningham a Conservancy 
member for four years, "it looks quite suspicious to everyone. . . . It sends a 
frightening message to developers that preservationists can be bought." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hillsman Wright, a Conservancy member who is also chairman of the Historic 
Theater Foundation, "I don't know if anyone can ever document that there was a 
quid pro quo here, but the issue is the appearance of evil." 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy was instrumental in temporarily halting demolition of the 
California Theater in 1988. But on May 24 it withdrew its nomination to the 
city-appointed Cultural Heritage Commission to make the site a protected 
landmark. It was the first time the Conservancy has withdrawn such a 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Needleman's gift had "nothing at all" to do with the group's position, 
Conservancy Executive Director Jay Rounds asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Since Needleman owns several historic downtown buildings, Rounds said, "clearly 
this was someone with whom it was important for us to develop a relationship, 
regardless of what happened on that particular case." 
</P>
<P>
When he and Needleman spoke on May 2, Rounds said, "I asked him if he would 
consider becoming a financial contributor in light of the work we were doing 
together and he said, 'Yes, how about $10,000?' " 
</P>
<P>
Jack Needleman was out of town this week and could not be reached for comment. 
His son, Steven, said that the events leading to the theater's demolition were 
"completely aboveboard."

MARVIN GAYE FINALLY GETS A STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am not a star. At least, I don't consider myself a star." 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Gaye, in a 1973 interview published in the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Grammy award-winning recording artist Marvin Gaye, popular for his intimate 
reflections on the ways of love and spiritual salvation, received a posthumous 
star Thursday on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The award came after two years of intensive campaigning by fans across the 
country and by local radio stations with predominantly African-American 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and fans gathered around Gaye's star on Vine Street adjacent to the 
Motown Building, which houses the company he recorded with during most of his 
career, turning out early hits such as "Stubborn Kind of Fellow," "Pride and 
Joy" and "Ain't No Mountain High Enough." His version of "I Heard It Through 
the Grapevine" is considered one of popular music's biggest hits. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of more than 400 reminisced about the soul singer who was shot to 
death in 1984 by his father, Marvin Gay Sr., during an argument in their 
Crenshaw district home. (Gaye added an "e" to his family name when he began 
recording for Motown in 1962). 
</P>
<P>
Fans remembered Gaye's smooth tenor, which has for two decades caused tears to 
well up in the eyes of the happy, the hurting, the introspective, and those 
with even the faintest stirrings of soul. 
</P>
<P>
Gaye's children, Nona, Marvin III and Frankie, accepted the award on behalf of 
their father. Marvin Gay Sr. and Gaye's mother, Alberta, did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
Gaye's father, who testified in court in 1984 that he was beaten repeatedly by 
his son, pleaded guilty to a voluntary manslaughter charge and was sentenced to 
a jail term that later was reduced to five years' probation. The probation 
period ended last November. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the African-American fans at Thursday's ceremony said the circumstances 
of Gaye's death, his reported abuse of drugs and his penchant for controversy 
may have caused an undue delay in his receiving a star. They also speculated 
that the Chamber of Commerce selection committee was uncomfortable with Gaye's 
outspoken -- some said strident -- manner. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we were told that Marvin didn't get a star because he was not a good 
role model," said Joyce Miller, 26, a South Los Angeles special education 
teacher who began lobbying two years ago for recognition of Gaye on the walk. 
"It is so offensive to black people to hear he was refused because of something 
like that," said Miller, noting that Elvis Presley, who also abused drugs, has 
a star on the walk. 
</P>
<P>
A protracted wait is common, said Johnny Grant, chairman of the star selection 
committee of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a doubt that Marvin would be given a star," Grant said. "It 
was just a matter of time." Grant added that a stipulation in the selection 
rules states that five years must pass before considering any candidate for a 
posthumous star.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: THE ULTIMATE DEPOSIT INSURER IS YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's read-my-lips time. Everyone wants to assure the American public that weak 
banks and savings and loans will be bailed out; that most deposits are insured, 
so they won't lose their money, and that even if the insurance runs out, money 
will be found. No one need ask which institutions are "safest" and whether they 
should pull out their money. 
</P>
<P>
A few people actually understand how the system works; they're familiar with 
the FDIC, the RTC and the OTS, with the bank insurance fund and the S&amp;L 
insurance fund and their respective stability. They even know how to 
"structure" deposits to insure millions of dollars in a few names at a few 
institutions without passing the $100,000 limit. 
</P>
<P>
More just respond to the promise that their funds are backed by the "full faith 
and credit" of the U.S. government. The derivation and exact meaning of the 
words in this context are obscure, but who cares? "They're magic words," says 
Monroe Price, dean of Yeshiva University's law school. "The phrase is 
comforting; more than the insurance fund is available." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers do the best they can, examining an institution's declared assets, 
longevity and advertising, then taking a leap of faith. "What else can you do?" 
asks Dona Sands, a school clerk in Los Angeles. "Put it in your mattress? I 
have a water bed." 
</P>
<P>
Deposit insurance goes back to the Depression, which made it clear that 
something had to stand behind bank deposits. To bolster public confidence in 
the banking system, in 1933 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was established 
for banks and a year later the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for 
S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
For almost half a century, these funds generally grew, increased by premiums 
and interest income. Premiums stayed low, thanks to the health of the funds and 
the industries -- 8.3 cents per $100 in deposits until quite recently. And to 
inspire more confidence and larger deposits, coverage climbed from FDIC's 
$2,500 in 1934 to $100,000 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The confidence part worked fine. Depositors rarely made runs on failing 
institutions. No one (read our lips) has lost any insured deposits. 
</P>
<P>
But then, the system wasn't tested much -- until the recent flood of failures. 
Many were nobody's fault, their causes "economic," attributable to mortgage 
defaults and soured real estate loans, to interest rate trends that made 
lenders pay more for deposits than they earned on old loans. Others were 
somebody's fault, usually some headlined high-rolling executives using their 
S&amp;L's funds for high life and projects less safe than home loans. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1986, the FSLIC was in what S&amp;L regulators call "a negative 
position," with "minus" $6.3 billion dollars, and by 1989, it was minus $74.9 
billion. In 1988, even the FDIC insurance fund sank from $18.3 billion to $14 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
More than confidence was eroding. In 1989, the government shook up the system, 
creating a new Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to regulate S&amp;Ls, burying 
the very dead FSLIC and starting a new Savings Assn. Insurance Fund, to be 
administered by the FDIC along with the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF). 
</P>
<P>
The remains of any previously failed S&amp;Ls went to the FDIC to sell off or 
parcel out along with insurance payoffs. Any failing or in danger of failing 
thereafter would go to the new Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC), which -- funded 
with $50 billion from Congress -- could operate it as a conservatorship, or, 
like the FDIC, sell it off wholly or in part, or dissolve it, paying out 
insurance on covered deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the institution or agency involved, says RTC spokesman Nancy 
Schertzing, the FDIC and RTC "are required to go with the least costly 
resolution option." That judgment, says FDIC spokesman David Barr, includes 
consideration of "the effect on the community, which may have fewer banks to 
serve it." Furthermore, selling an institution saves all deposits, not just the 
three-quarters protected by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
It also saves time, for depositors. With a conservatorship, or a change of 
ownership, a bank "is usually open the next day, with no interruption in 
service," Barr says. A payout, he says, could take four days. 
</P>
<P>
If sustaining confidence was a prime goal, government action, and government 
assurances, have worked again. People have full faith that there's insurance, 
and beyond that, credit somewhere: the most spectacular failures (Lincoln 
Savings, for one) cause no panic in the streets and minimal withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
But the insurance funds are hardly solid. The Bank Insurance Fund is expected 
to be $10.2 billion by year-end, or "under stress," Barr says. The new savings 
fund won't be touchable or solvent until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
There are discussions of lowering the deposits covered by insurance and of 
further raising insurance premiums, which for banks are now more than double 
what they were a decade ago and for S&amp;Ls almost triple, and are still -- at 
19.5 and 23 cents per $100 on deposit -- inadequate. There may be more 
restrictions yet on what financial institutions can do with deposited monies 
and fewer restrictions on the financial services they can sell. 
</P>
<P>
There's always that "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government, but if it's 
the ultimate assurance for people, it's also their ultimate loss. In its 
ultimate form, it's the monies government can raise by taxing the people, i.e., 
what their right hand will be paying to reimburse their left.

Shoppers frustrated by the closing of hundreds of beverage-container recycling

The collection companies had long charged that state recycling laws made many 
of their centers money-losers. Now several bills supported by the collectors to 
improve recycling economics -- particularly for such materials as glass -- have 
been signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
One of the state's biggest collection site operators, 20/20 Recycle Centers, 
closed more than 200 centers in California this summer. It said the centers had 
been losing money since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Reynolds Aluminum Recycling Co., another major collector, refused 
to accept glass or plastic containers at three of its 115 California sites. 
Reynolds said it would lose $1 million in 1990 under the current program. 
</P>
<P>
Envipco California Inc., operator of about 600 reverse vending machines around 
the state, had shut down 40 sites. The fourth major collector is Mobil 
Recycling Corp., with 136 locations. 
</P>
<P>
California has been "easily one of the most contentious scenes in the country 
in the state of recycling," said Jerry Powell, editor of Portland, Ore.-based 
Resource Recycling magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in California has been that markets for recycled material have been 
strong for aluminum, used in about 70% of beverage containers, but soft for 
glass and plastic, used in about 25% and 5%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Many consumers were particularly upset this spring to learn that 7,000 tons of 
glass turned in last year for recycling had been dumped in landfills because of 
a glut of recycled glass. 
</P>
<P>
Collection companies have charged that financial incentives in the original 
bill that should have made glass and plastic profitable haven't operated as 
hoped. They also objected to provisions mandating that centers be sited near 
major supermarkets around the state, whether or not the sites proved efficient 
and profitable. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new bills, AB 1490 sponsored by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo 
Alto), gives recyclers financial incentives to keep centers open. The other, AB 
2622 from Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Union City), requires manufacturers 
to use more recycled glass, expanding that market. 
</P>
<P>
The new laws were also praised by environmentalists. "We feel we've really won 
the battle this year on the glass crisis," said Sandra E. Jerabek, executive 
director of Sacramento-based Californians Against Waste, which lobbied for the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
"They will assist to some extent for plastic, which will remain a very 
difficult material to recycle," Jerabek added. 
</P>
<P>
A. Lee Johnson, vice president for governmental affairs for 20/20 Recycle, said 
he anticipated that "about 80% of the redemption centers we closed will become 
economically viable with the changes in law."

Unisys Suspends Dividend: Financially strapped Unisys Corp. said its board of 
directors voted to suspend its common stock dividend in a move that will save 
the company $160 million a year. By eliminating the 25-cent-a-share quarterly 
dividend on about 160 million shares outstanding, Unisys hopes to shore up its 
debt-laden balance sheet.

SECRET REVIEW OF NORTHROP MAY STIR FUROR; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE COMPANY SAYS AN AIR FORCE REPORT IS FAVORABLE; OTHERS TERM IT 
DAMAGING. CONGRESS MAY FOCUS ON IT AT HEARINGS NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An intensive and still confidential Air Force review of Northrop Corp.'s 
management problems, ordered by Assistant Secretary John J. Welch Jr., is 
becoming the centerpiece of what is likely to be an adversarial congressional 
hearing about the Los Angeles aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa said Wednesday that the Welch review, which was 
completed in July, resulted in a "very favorable" report about the company and 
that he has "no quarrels" with the findings. 
</P>
<P>
"They found some things that we could improve, but there were many things that 
were very favorable," Kresa said Thursday during his first meeting with 
reporters since becoming the company's chairman earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
But congressional investigators for Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), who plans 
to call a hearing next month and subpoena Kresa, on Thursday took a 
substantially different view of the Welch report. 
</P>
<P>
"The report is one of the most damaging things I have ever seen," said a 
Dingell staff member who has read it. "I don't understand how he could say it 
is favorable." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kresa nor his congressional critics would discuss the specific findings 
of the report. But a letter last June from Welch to Kresa, a copy of which was 
obtained by The Times, made it clear that the review was a severe measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the performance problems is most serious," Welch wrote to Kresa. 
"I encourage your direct personal involvement in promptly correcting them." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Welch told Kresa that he was "concerned about recurring program 
problems the Air Force is having with Northrop. While some programs have shown 
improvement in the past year, others, including Tacit Rainbow (a missile 
program) and key classified programs, continue to reflect poor performance." 
</P>
<P>
The tough language is nothing new for Northrop. In addition to criticism from 
Pentagon leaders, the company has been excoriated by three congressional 
committees in seven hearings since 1987. Additional hearings are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell's Energy and Commerce Committee and two other House committees are 
expected to hold Northrop hearings next month. If Kresa testifies, the hearing 
is likely to be unusually adversarial. In earlier hearings, members of Congress 
have expressed outrage at the unwillingness of Northrop executives to appear. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get the confidence of Congress," Kresa said Thursday. "They 
(members of Congress) have been shaken by a lot of the allegations. We have to 
get beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
The congressional furor is taking a toll on Northrop and creating a major 
challenge for Kresa in his new job just as he is attempting to emphasize 
corporate ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa acknowledged that the company has made mistakes in the past and at one 
point referred to some of those errors as "not a glorious chapter." Though he 
did not explicitly criticize former Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones, the 
mistakes occurred during Jones' tenure. 
</P>
<P>
In other matters, Kresa said flight testing of the firm's advanced tactical 
fighter is going well and will be completed in another month. He also said the 
second B-2 Stealth bomber, which has yet to fly, is about a month behind 
schedule.

Construction Contracts Off: The value of new construction contracts fell 3% in 
August from the previous month, reflecting a steep drop in the office building 
sector and continued weakness in housing, the F. W. Dodge division of 
McGraw-Hill said. The Dodge index, which uses 1982 as its base of 100, fell to 
146 in August, compared to July's 150 level. The seasonally adjusted indicator 
of future construction activity represents the value of newly started projects 
of all kinds.

Signaling further problems in the banking business, Bank of Boston Corp. said 
Thursday that it will eliminate 1,500 jobs, report a loss of up to $250 million 
for the third quarter and slash its dividend. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the First National Bank of Boston, the largest bank in New England 
and the nation's 15th-biggest, also said it will take cost-cutting steps aimed 
at saving $100 million by 1991's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of its rivals, Bank of Boston attributed its woes to the 
deteriorating real estate market and the ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking decisive and admittedly painful actions," Bank of Boston 
Chairman and Chief Executive Ira Stepanian said. "Yet, in doing so, we are 
building upon an already strong foundation."

SMALL BUSINESS: REGISTERING TRADEMARK CAN SAVE YOU LATER ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Buoyed by the popularity of their trendy hair salon in the Chicago suburb of 
Hinsdale, Raymond Koubek and Salvatore Segretto created a line of shampoos, 
conditioners and gels under the Zazu salon brand. 
</P>
<P>
They registered "Zazu" with the Illinois trademark office in 1980 and began 
selling the products to clients on a limited basis in 1985. In 1986, Koubek and 
Segretto were astonished to see national magazine ads for a line of temporary 
hair color products called Zazu, placed by L'Oreal, a major Paris-based 
cosmetics company. 
</P>
<P>
"We were as careful as a small business owner could be and went through the 
trouble of protecting ourselves," said Koubek, who told L'Oreal to stop using 
his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
L'Oreal officials told him it was too late to stop distribution of what turned 
out to be a short-lived product. 
</P>
<P>
The angry entrepreneurs sued L'Oreal, and in September, 1988, a federal judge 
in Chicago awarded Zazu's founders $2.1 million in damages. They are still 
waiting for the money but feel vindicated because the judge agreed that L'Oreal 
flagrantly violated Zazu's trademark registration. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Sullivan, corporate counsel for Cosmair Inc., which licenses the 
L'Oreal line, said the decision was "extraordinarily unusual" and added that he 
is still awaiting the judge's final ruling in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Many small-business owners who think filing for a trademark is too expensive or 
time-consuming will be surprised to learn that it usually costs less than 
$1,000 and can save you endless grief. 
</P>
<P>
"The money you spend in the beginning to protect your name is going to pay 
itself back 100 times," said James Warren, head of the intellectual property 
group at the San Francisco law firm Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro. 
</P>
<P>
Warren, who has been hired to protect the "New Kids on the Block" rock group 
name, among other big and small company trademarks, said that even the tiniest 
company can benefit from trademark protection. 
</P>
<P>
Your company may be small now, but if your products or services take off, you 
don't want imitators to threaten your success. On the other hand, if you use a 
name that belongs to someone else, you can be put out of business immediately 
if they find out. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to conduct a trademark search on your own, but hiring a 
competent trademark attorney is not as expensive as you might think. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've chosen a name you like, the first step is to see if anyone else is 
using it or anything that sounds or looks like it. This kind of first-level 
search is usually done by paralegals and costs $50 to $100. If nothing turns 
up, the next step is to complete a national search of databases, telephone 
books, trade magazines and other published sources. The second phase can cost 
$250 or more, depending on the complexity and comprehensiveness of the search. 
</P>
<P>
Names are not the only thing you can register as a trademark. Logos and graphic 
designs can also be protected, Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
If the name you choose is available, the next step is to file an application 
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The government charges a $175 
application fee for each class of goods or service your product falls into. To 
qualify for a federal trademark registration, your products must be sold in 
more than one state. 
</P>
<P>
After your application arrives at the Patent Office, it is turned over to an 
attorney who determines whether there is anything "confusingly similar" between 
your trademark and others. If your trademark application clears this hurdle, 
notice of your intent to register the mark is published four times in a weekly 
publication called the "Official Gazette" -- so others can be alerted. 
</P>
<P>
If no one files a notice of opposition, the registration certificate is usually 
issued by the Patent Office within four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood entrepreneur Ken Girouard learned the hard way how vigilantly 
giant corporations monitor their trademarks. Fruit of the Loom recently filed 
suit against Girouard and his company, Two Left Feet, over the "Fruit Flops" 
name that Girouard uses on his firm's hand-decorated rubber beach sandals. 
Girouard, a former Madison Avenue ad executive, never attempted to get a 
trademark. He contends, however, that the big apparel maker does not have a 
monopoly on the word "fruit" and has hired an attorney to defend him in Los 
Angeles federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Although big corporations have entire legal departments devoted to protecting 
trademarks, small-business owners usually must rely on vendors and customers to 
tell them if another firm is infringing on their product name. 
</P>
<P>
"The companies that have spent millions and billions of dollars creating, 
protecting and promoting their trademarks are very vigilant," said Michael 
Finn, spokesman for the United States Trademark Assn. in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Finn said there are about 650,000 active, federally registered trademarks, plus 
thousands of others registered with states. In our computerized society, he 
said, anyone who tries to get away with using someone else's name will 
eventually get caught. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, Finn said, many product names have lost their protected 
status because they were commonly used by the press and the public. Corn 
flakes, nylon, escalator, dry ice, kerosene and raisin bran are among products 
that have been victims of "genericide," or generic use, according to Finn. 
</P>
<P>
He said his association, which has about 2,200 members, offers several 
publications to help business owners deal with trademark issues. 
</P>
<P>
"A Trademark is Not a Patent or Copyright," "Protecting Your Trademarks 
Abroad," "Trademark Checklist," "The Guide to Proper Trademark Use" and 
"Trademarks . . . A Winning Combination" are among the publications available 
for a modest fee. To obtain a publication and price list, send a self-addressed 
stamped envelope to: U.S. Trademark Assn., 6 East 45 St., New York, N.Y. 10017. 
</P>

CHIAT'S CREATIVE CHIEF IN N.Y. QUITS SUDDENLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chiat/Day/Mojo, the Venice agency whose New York office is already down on its 
luck, got another kick in the teeth Thursday. Its mercurial but highly talented 
East Coast creative chief abruptly left to start his own agency. 
</P>
<P>
Tom McElligott, who created the current black-and-white ads for Calvin Klein's 
Obsession, which feature an off-camera narrator reciting literary passages and 
actors from TV's "Twin Peaks," will become chairman of a new Minneapolis 
agency, McElligott Wright Morrison White. 
</P>
<P>
The move is a blow to Chiat/Day, which seemed to have pulled a major coup in 
November, 1989, when it brought the 47-year-old McElligott on board. Ever 
provocative, McElligott is regarded by many as one of a handful of top creative 
directors in the nation. Some rank him second only to Chiat/Day's other top 
creative head, Lee Clow. 
</P>
<P>
The timing could hardly be worse for Chiat/Day, which has seen a recent flow of 
business away from its New York office. This year it has lost much of the 
$30-million Reebok business as well as the $20-million account for Royal 
Caribbean Cruise Line. Earlier this week, it also lost the $4-million Arrow 
shirt ad business. The agency reshuffled management in the New York office 
earlier this summer, including appointing a new president. 
</P>
<P>
For McElligott and his partners -- all of whom have worked together at one 
point or another -- the timing would also seem to present a problem. The 
advertising industry is in a slowdown, and many agencies are struggling to stay 
above water. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, we believe that the looming recession is a perfect environment for 
this agency's birth," McElligott said in a statement. He was en route to 
Minneapolis and unavailable for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which officially opens Nov. 1, has no clients. But in no time it is 
expected to compete head-on with Fallon McElligott, the Minneapolis agency 
where he was founding partner. That shop made its mark nationally in the 
mid-1980s by winning top awards.

COUPLE HAVE GOOD WORKS CUT OUT FOR THEM;

VOLUNTEERS: ALTHOUGH RELATIVE NEWCOMERS TO THE SOUTHLAND, MAURICE AND CAROLYN 
DEWALD ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FUND-RAISING FOR L.A. CHARITIES AND CIVIC

Newcomers to Los Angeles four years ago, Maurice and Carolyn DeWald jumped into 
corporate, civic and social life. "We were welcomed with open arms -- but, of 
course, you have to reach out. And it takes a long time to nourish 
friendships," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Maury was invited to head the Music Center Unified Fund drive that 
raised $15.3 million. His reward: another year as chairman. This year the goal 
is $17.6 million. He'll balance that with his job as managing partner of KPMG 
Peat Marwick Los Angeles, the accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn will co-chair the Bunker Hill Steps inaugural benefit for Maguire 
Thomas Partners and the Music Center on Wednesday. The party dedicates the 
Mediterranean inspired steps, a part of the Library Towers project. She also 
chairs Women to the Rescue, which is soliciting funds to build an emergency 
shelter at Union Rescue Mission for women and children on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
In free moments, he reads, golfs at Los Angeles Country Club, walks. She reads, 
knits, does aerobics and walks four times a week at the beach. They are parents 
of three daughters -- Anne, seeking a master's in social work at Columbia 
University; Colleen, a Los Angeles second-grade teacher, and Michelle, a 
sophomore at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
They're on the benefit circle at least two nights a week. Said Carolyn, whose 
favorite activity is the Philharmonic and a picnic at the Hollywood Bowl, "and 
we value our time together when we can sit at home and enjoy each other." 
</P>
<P>
DeWald considers Los Angeles a developing city with enormous avenues of 
opportunity. He's dedicated to Music Center goals. One is to create an 
endowment for the center as a hedge against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Only about $4.2 million -- of Unified Fund donations will come from 
corporations, he said. For him, the $4.2 million is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we increased corporate support by getting more than 300 new 
corporate donors. You look at what happened in the '80s: Corporations moved 
out, merged, went bankrupt. So, the quest is significant. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to fan out to the mainstream of business enterprise, tell the 
corporate community of our long-term needs. We try to make it easy for 
businesses to come in -- $5,000 a year for five years -- or $25,000. The last 
thing we want is only 200 companies giving and a recession."

Then he reflected, "The idea is to put something back into the community that 
provides us the opportunity to be in a position to be successful."

The DeWalds have always been success-oriented. She graduated from St. Joseph's 
School of Nursing in Ft. Wayne, Ind., he from the University of Notre Dame with 
an accounting degree. After marrying, they lived in Ft. Lewis, Wash. for two 
years while he was in the Army. Then he joined Peat Marwick (the only company's 
he's ever worked for) in Chicago in 1962, elected partner in 1973 and became 
managing partner in Orange County in 1976, and managing partner in Chicago in 
1985 before coming here in 1986.

<P>
In Orange County he was chairman of the South Coast Repertory Theater; she was 
chairman-elect of the Guilds of the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
Maurice DeWald is also a member of the United Way corporate board and a trustee 
of St. John's Hospital Foundation and Loyola Marymount.

SOCIETY: ANGELENOS BRIEFLY ENTER SOCIAL CIRCLE OF THE KISSINGERS, TRUMPS, AND 
BUCKLEYS AT GALA AFTER L.A. PHILHARMONIC CONCERT.

<P>
The 100th anniversary of Carnegie Hall may have belonged to New York, but the 
gala centennial performance belonged to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's how some 40 L.A. Philharmonic supporters felt Wednesday night 
when the orchestra performed in the newly restored Carnegie Hall. The concert 
wrapped up two days of events planned around the sold-out performance. 
</P>
<P>
At a rehearsal earlier in the day, Philharmonic board president Stanley Beyer 
told orchestra members, "There will be 2,800 people here tonight celebrating 
Carnegie Hall -- but there will be 40 people celebrating you." 
</P>
<P>
The celebrations continued at the post-performance, black-tie gala for 600 at 
the private Metropolitan Club, a former residence with an interior that rivals 
a museum: walls and ceilings painted like the Sistine Chapel and elaborate 
moldings. 
</P>
<P>
The overstuffed chairs and vague mustiness that usually characterize the club 
were gone for the evening, replaced by tables for 10 decorated with black lace 
runners and enormous sprays of hydrangeas, roses and baby's breath. 
</P>
<P>
The Angelenos were not only awed by the surroundings but also by the other 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
The New York social X-rays and usual suspects seen in the party pages of W were 
there, including Henry and Nancy Kissinger, Blaine Trump, Nan Kempner, Estee 
Lauder, Claudia Cohen and Ronald Perelman, Ricky and Ralph Lauren, Beverly 
Sills, Annette and Oscar de la Renta, Gloria Steinem, and Pat and William 
Buckley Jr., who co-chaired the gala with Stanley and Lynn Beyer. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles contingent displayed a strange fascination with these fabled 
Eastern socialites come to life. Some scrutinized the New Yorkers' jewels and 
debated whether or not they could carry off wearing strapless gowns. 
</P>
<P>
There was little interaction between East and West Coast camps. The 
Philharmonic supporters were seated together at separate tables and seemed 
content to be with each other. 
</P>
<P>
When Carnegie Hall board chairman James Wolfensohn spoke to the crowd and 
declared the L.A. Philharmonic "one of the great American orchestras," the 
loudest cheers came from the four Los Angeles tables. 
</P>
<P>
Among those applauding were John and Joan Hotchkis, David Begelman, the Beyers' 
children Robert Beyer and Laurian Legett, Joanna Carson, Royce and Jennifer 
Diener, Ginny Mancini, Della Koenig, Diane Downey and Philharmonic managing 
director Ernest Fleischmann with daughter Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, like others in the group, has an apartment in New York and comes here 
frequently. She said she joined up with the others because of her support of 
the orchestra. Begelman mentioned a love of music, a fondness for the 
Philharmonic and a good excuse to come to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone realized that 40 people had come from Los Angeles to hear the 
Philharmonic. Declared conductor Andre Previn, with some surprise, "I didn't 
know there were so many (L.A.) people here." 
</P>
<P>
Violinist Itzhak Perlman seemed in a jolly mood as he accepted congratulations 
from his fans for his performance. "My husband was transported," gushed Pat 
Buckley, leaning over to greet him while tugging at the bodice of her black 
strapless mini. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the setting and the players, the gala was amazingly similar to the 
Los Angeles social circuit -- same schmoozing, same banquet food (veal chops, 
stuffed vegetables, ice cream in a chocolate shell), same air kisses, same 
designer gowns, same urgency to leave at the stroke of midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Oscar, come on!" said his wife Annette when the designer dallied too long 
talking to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Before the concert, the Angelenos were invited to a cocktail party at the 
pied-a-terre of songwriter Hal David and wife Eunice. 
</P>
<P>
Guests nibbled on hors d'oeuvres and gazed out at the 
they-look-like-ants-from-here view. They chatted about differences between New 
York and Los Angeles. (Of New York: It's great to be able to walk, bad when the 
cars aim for you.) 
</P>
<P>
The day had begun with a four-course lunch at Bice that had diners groaning as 
they left the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Emanuel Ax, who is performing with the Philharmonic tonight at Carnegie 
Hall, was there, along with Carnegie Hall archivist Gino Francesconi. 
</P>
<P>
Those who were up for more visual stimulation proceeded to Carnegie Hall after 
lunch for a tour of the archives. 
</P>
<P>
And when the day was finished, friends parted ways, discussed plans to tour 
with the orchestra to London and Salzburg, Austria, next, and said, "See you 
back in town."

STUDY SAYS CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT MAY RETARD BONE LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calcium supplements can retard bone loss associated with osteoporosis, but only 
in older women who have been postmenopausal for at least five years and who 
have calcium-deficient diets, a study published in Thursday's New England 
Journal of Medicine reveals. 
</P>
<P>
Among women who have been postmenopausal five years or less, calcium 
supplements appear ineffective in preventing a very rapid phase of bone loss, 
said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, chief of the calcium and bone metabolism 
laboratory at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts 
University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But after about five years, calcium supplements appear to kick in, preventing 
further bone deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the good news is. If you are out of that rapid dip period, and if 
you have a low dietary intake, then increasing your calcium to the recommended 
dietary allowances has a very substantial benefit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Past research on the effectiveness of calcium supplements has yielded mixed 
results because most studies have failed to distinguish between women who are 
recently postmenopausal and those who are well beyond menopause, Dawson-Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, calcium is widely held as important in preventing bone loss, but 
medical experts have not agreed on the need for supplements. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at subsets of the postmenopausal population," Dawson-Hughes 
said. "We had enough people here that we could partition them into subsets and 
thereby develop more of an idea of what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
The study is clear on two other points. Women who already achieve high calcium 
intake through their diets do not need supplements. And supplements of calcium 
citrate malate, a form patented by Procter &amp; Gamble and found in Citrus 
Hill Plus Calcium orange and grapefruit juices, appeared to be better absorbed 
than calcium carbonate, the more popular form found in over-the-counter 
products such as Tums, Dawson-Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
The study examined 301 healthy, postmenopausal women ages 40 to 70 for two 
years. Half of the women had a usual dietary calcium intake of less than 400 
milligrams a day -- about two servings of calcium-rich food. Women with dietary 
calcium intakes of 400 to 650 milligrams a day made up the second group. 
</P>
<P>
The Recommended Daily Allowance for adults ages 25 and older is 800 milligrams 
a day, about four servings of a calcium-rich food. 
</P>
<P>
American women, however, rarely achieve the RDA for calcium through diet alone, 
Dawson-Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Calcium is found in milk, yogurt, cheese, canned salmon and sardines, and dark 
green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collard greens and kale. 
</P>
<P>
Each group was randomly divided into three subgroups: those who received 500 
milligrams of calcium carbonate, those who received 500 milligrams of calcium 
citrate malate and those who received a placebo. Bone measurements were taken 
in the neck, spine and forearm. 
</P>
<P>
The results showed that women who had undergone menopause five or fewer years 
earlier had significant bone loss that was unaffected by supplements in any 
form. 
</P>
<P>
At menopause, the female hormone estrogen, which helps protect against bone 
loss, begins to decline rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
"Among recently postmenopausal women, we found that the calcium supplementation 
didn't seem to matter," Dawson-Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bone seems to be under such strong influence of the body's dropping 
estrogen level." 
</P>
<P>
But after about five years, the supplements appeared to prevent further bone 
loss in women deficient in calcium. 
</P>
<P>
"The study is encouraging because it suggests that calcium can help prevent 
bone loss, which has been disputed by some researchers," said Bonnie Liebman, a 
nutritionist for the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think women who have recently undergone menopause should say, 'I'm not 
going to worry about calcium for five years.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Liebman said the study's findings that calcium citrate malate was more 
effective than calcium carbonate deserves follow-up study because the former is 
generally more costly and available only in Citrus Hill Plus Calcium fruit 
juices. 
</P>
<P>
The study does not reveal whether calcium carbonate would be more effective in 
higher doses or if taken with food, Liebman said (the subjects took the 
supplements without food). 
</P>
<P>
The study found women with lower dietary calcium intake who consumed calcium 
citrate malate had no significant bone loss. 
</P>
<P>
Women who received calcium carbonate maintained bone density in the hip and 
forearm but lost bone in the spine. 
</P>
<P>
The women on the placebo lost 2% to 3% of bone density at the hip, forearm and 
spine over two years. Among women with higher dietary calcium intake, there 
were no differences among subjects taking either form of calcium supplement or 
the placebo. 
</P>
<P>
"This fits with the idea that (supplementation) benefits those who are 
deficient," Dawson-Hughes said. "But more and more and more is not better and 
better and better. 
</P>
<P>
"Women in America, in this age range, have an intake of 475 milligrams a day. 
That's very little -- just over half the RDA -- of what they need," 
Dawson-Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would promote the use of calcium-rich foods as a first priority. When a 
woman is unable to meet the requirements by doing that, using supplements would 
be your second preferred route."

STATE-OF-ART LOVE INNS FLOURISH IN JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: OFFERING SPACE AND PRIVACY, THE HOTELS ARE HAVENS OF CONFIDENTIALITY 
FOR THE ILLICIT AFFAIR.

<P>
With characteristic efficiency and ingenuity, the Japanese have brought the 
full force of modern technology to bear on a timeless human endeavor: the 
secret afternoon tryst. 
</P>
<P>
All over the country, a special breed of hotels exists just for couples who 
want a quick fling in complete confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
These establishments use state-of-the-art automation, permitting guests to pick 
a room, check in, eat and drink, enjoy themselves, pay the bill and depart -- 
all without seeing, or being seen by, another human being. 
</P>
<P>
According to hotel-industry estimates, Japan has more than 20,000 such places, 
known here as "love hotels," "fashion hotels" or "abeku hotels" -- the Japanese 
pronunciation of the French word "avec," or "with." 
</P>
<P>
Generally renting rooms for two hours at a time, the hotels are so popular that 
many have to provide waiting areas where guests can bide their time until a 
vacancy is available. 
</P>
<P>
In a teeming country where most people live in tiny homes or apartments jammed 
sardine-style among countless others, the love hotels flourish because they 
offer two precious commodities -- space and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Although intended primarily to accommodate illicit affairs, the love hotels 
also draw business from married couples and innocent lovers with nothing to 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah, we get married couples in here; sometimes a couple of grandparents 
come in together," said Mamoru Saga, proprietor of a Tokyo love hotel called 
the San Eight. "You know, their house is so small, and the kids are running 
around, and the bedroom door is shoji (rice paper framed in wood). It's just 
too noisy for them at home. They can't be alone." 
</P>
<P>
Saga's hotel also gets its share of secretive couples, he said. "College kids 
come in; guys come in a lot with their secretaries. Sometimes they even do work 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other love hotels, the San Eight has its own "frequent-flyer" card, 
permitting discounted rates after a certain number of visits. For privacy 
reasons, the cards are issued by number, and no names are ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Love hotels are generally easy to locate in Japan. They tend to be clustered in 
particular neighborhoods or resort towns. They often take foreign names, either 
French ("C'est La Vie," "Chez Nous," "Petit Elegance") or English ("Paper 
Moon," "Dixy Inn"), and often the name is meant to be suggestive ("Hotel 
Passion," "Once More," "Sweet Lovers Inn"). 
</P>
<P>
Another way to spot a love hotel is from the characteristic high wall that 
blocks the entrance so customers can slip in without being seen from the 
street. Many of the inns also have underground parking lots. In some cases, the 
parking places are equipped with a shield that comes down automatically behind 
the car so that its license plate can't be seen. 
</P>
<P>
When patrons enter a love hotel, sensing devices perceive their presence and 
trigger a tape recording that offers instructions on how to check in. 
Generally, the hotels have a lighted board in the tiny lobby displaying 
pictures of the various types of rooms and beds available. Some of the newer 
hotels offer computerized laser-vision displays to help guests choose the right 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Having made a choice, the guests press a button next to the picture of the 
desired room. Signs then guide the couple to a desk, where they put money or a 
frequent-visitor card into a slot and obtain the room key. 
</P>
<P>
In the room, there's generally a mini-bar offering snacks and drinks, with 
payment on the honor system. Many love hotels also sell a variety of potions 
promising to fortify strength, ardor or both. Various types of condoms and 
"adult toys" may also be for sale. Guests can automatically order movies -- 
adult or otherwise -- to be shown on the room's television set. 
</P>
<P>
When the allotted time is up, a discreet bell rings in the room, telling the 
guests it is time to leave. The departure times for each room are often 
synchronized so that no two couples are in the halls or the elevator at the 
same time. Generally, the exit is through a back door, so guests won't 
inadvertently run into somebody who happens to be arriving by the main 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Rates vary, depending on the location and level of grandeur of the hotel. Here 
in Tokyo, the two-hour charge -- listed euphemistically on the hotels' signs as 
the "rest" rate -- runs roughly from $30 to $90. Most love hotels also offer an 
all-night fare -- listed as the "stay" rate and good from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. -- 
for about 20% more. 
</P>
<P>
Although love hotels are devoted to maintaining privacy, the method of 
providing total secrecy is not always met automatically anymore. In some places 
the law requires that at least one desk clerk be on hand at all times. Some 
hotels deal with that by putting a shade in front of the clerk so he can't see 
who checks in. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, moreover, the love hotels are attracting people who don't seem to 
care whether anybody sees them or not.

We go now to the Pure Platinum nightspot in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
On the honky-tonk strip of North Hill Street. Catering to young Marines from 
Camp Pendleton and other males of refined taste. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, lissome young ladies wiggle in studied ecstasy. Rock 'n' roll music 
plays. Men watch, drink and go bug-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular eve, a dancer named Tammy Rowland, 30, is doing a "table 
dance" for a small group. 
</P>
<P>
In this art form, the dancer moves within inches of the patrons, who then 
reward her with currency. The going rate is $5. 
</P>
<P>
One patron is slow to pay. Tammy gets impatient. Arnold Heller, 64, of Solana 
Beach is fumbling in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
A hand grenade pops from his pocket. Understandably, Tammy gets agitated at the 
sight of a grenade between her legs. 
</P>
<P>
Another dancer, April White, 22, rushes over. The cops are called. 
</P>
<P>
White says she has a degree in psychology, which helps her cope with Pure 
Platinum's interesting clientele. 
</P>
<P>
The grenade is just a dud from World War II, Heller tells the cops. So are you 
buddy, they reply, and haul Heller off to the Vista jail. 
</P>
<P>
Heller explains: I'm a World War II veteran. I just keep a hollowed-out grenade 
to scare off panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
Heller is now charged with a misdemeanor, like someone who makes a phony bomb 
threat. Trial is set for Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The folks at Pure Platinum hope the case will make a statement about what 
constitutes acceptable behavior at skin parlors. 
</P>
<P>
Yelling and whistling are fine. Grenades, even hollowed-out ones, are 
anti-social. 
</P>
<P>
"In this business, you see a lot of weird things," said assistant manager Dave 
Galaviz. "Guys get out of line with the girls all the time, but I'd never seen 
one pull an explosive device out of his pants."

$1.1-MILLION FOR JAIL ABUSE UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what his attorney called one more step toward a citizens' review board, a 
$1.1-million award given to a former Navy chaplain who had been beaten in a 
Vista jail was upheld Thursday by a Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Barbara Gamer then added to the award by attaching to it more than 
$200,000 in legal fees incurred by Jim Butler, 60, in his lawsuit against the 
county and Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
David B. Florance, the attorney for the defendants, said afterward that the 
verdict would be appealed, even though Gamer had rejected the motion for a new 
trial. Gamer added that interest would be assessed to any money owed to Butler, 
pending the outcome of an appeal or a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's victory follows the $332,000 awarded Wednesday by a Superior Court 
jury to a Vista woman who complained that sheriff's deputies used excessive 
force in booking her into County Jail.

<P>
Tom Adler, Butler's attorney, said that Wednesday's North County verdict was 
"just icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you could say Jim and his attorney are very happy," Adler said with a 
smile. "This mistake on the part of the county should finally help land a 
citizens' review board, which has been needed for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Butler has offered to give $320,000 of the $1.1 million award to offset 
start-up costs of a review board. The Board of Supervisors voted in July to 
place a measure on the November ballot that would create such a board to 
monitor the performance of sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Although outgoing Sheriff Duffy is opposed to the idea, sheriff's candidates 
Jim Roache and Jack Drown have said they support a review board. 
</P>
<P>
"Any organization needs a system of checks and balances," Butler said. "Our 
founding fathers said that about the Constitution. We have to have such a thing 
to check abuses of power. And in the past, Duffy has been responsible for a lot 
of abuses." 
</P>
<P>
Butler was jailed for less than 24 hours in January, 1985. He said the 
intervening five years of litigation triggered a heart attack, clinical 
depression and the loss of a $25,000-a-year business renovating mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Jan. 19, 1985, Butler and his cousins were in his Vista home in 
the 1600 block of Foothill Drive. They were cleaning up after dinner when they 
heard screeching brakes and dashed outside to offer assistance to accident 
victims. Until that night, Butler had no arrest record. 
</P>
<P>
According to Butler, he asked Deputy Robert Bishop to turn on his patrol car's 
flashers and move the vehicle to the hilltop, out of the way of other cars. 
Butler says the response was physical and verbal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was tossed into a patrol car, taken to jail and then beaten, denied 
access to badly needed medication for high blood pressure, and placed inside a 
rubber-padded cell. 
</P>
<P>
He has likened the experience to rape. 
</P>
<P>
Florance, the sheriff's attorney, has characterized Butler's behavior that 
night as intrusive, saying that Butler tried to give orders to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who once taught students in a Catholic high school and served as a 
chaplain in Vietnam, has called the ordeal worse than anything he endured in 
Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to help other people," he said. "Because I was doing that, I 
got into a confrontation. When I was in jail, I was beaten badly. I suffered a 
dislocated shoulder. They broke my nose. 
</P>
<P>
"The police like to use this term 'attitude adjustment.' I just hope they learn 
to apply the same term to their own work and forget this Rambo, shoot-em-up 
stuff forever."

LATE PAPERWORK STALLS START OF BRODERICK TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: AN UNFINISHED QUESTIONNAIRE FOR POTENTIAL JURORS STOPPED PROCEEDINGS 
FIVE MINUTES AFTER THEY STARTED IN THE TRIAL OF A WOMAN CHARGED WITH KILLING 
HER EX-HUSBAND AND HIS NEW WIFE.

Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick's double murder trial officially began 
Thursday -- and concluded for the day all of five minutes later because a jury 
questionnaire was not yet ready. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection in the case was due to start Thursday with distribution of the 
questionnaire to hundreds of potential jurors. But since the form was not 
finished, San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan called a halt to the 
proceedings and ordered them to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said that his preliminary review of the questionnaire indicated that it 
contained some sensitive questions. He did not, however, disclose the nature of 
any of the questions. 
</P>
<P>
He also warned Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells and defense lawyer Jack Earley 
that they would not be allowed follow-up questions in open court on the 
sensitive material. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, faces two counts of murder in the shooting deaths last Nov. 5 of 
her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena 
Broderick. They were shot as they slept in their Marston Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and a former 
county bar president. 
</P>
<P>
During and after a bitter divorce, Betty accused Daniel of using his legal 
influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure income. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick confessed to the killings in a March interview with The Times. 
She said they were a "desperate act of self-defense" against a man who wanted 
to control her. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick has pleaded not guilty. She has been held without bail at the 
Las Colinas women's jail in Santee since November. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's hearing, she wore an electric-blue suit that almost hid the 
chains around her waist and wrist, a change from the appliqued pantsuit she 
wore at previous court appearances. She also appeared to have lost considerable 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection, which will begin officially today when the questionnaires are 
distributed to hundreds of potential jurors, is expected to last two or three 
weeks, Whelan said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the trial is slated to run six or seven weeks, Whelan said. "In no 
event" should it last until Thanksgiving, he said.

PARENTS, TEACHERS REACT TO TRUSTEES' ACTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TWO SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS' DECISION TO PUT CHILDREN IN PRIVATE SCHOOL 
SPURS MIXED REACTION FROM COMMUNITY. 
</P>

<P>
The decision by two San Diego city school trustees to send their children to 
private schools drew both positive and negative reactions from parents and 
teachers Thursday. "If they're really committed to changing the system, I would 
assume they would believe in it enough to have their kids in the system," said 
Shane Rose, the mother of two children at Ulysses S. Grant Elementary School in 
Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Trustee Shirley Weber took her son out of the gifted program at 
Encanto Elementary School and put him into the fourth grade at Community 
Preparatory School in Southeast San Diego, a private elementary academy 
focusing on the self-esteem of African-American children. 
</P>
<P>
Her colleague and school board president Kay Davis has moved her middle 
daughter from Point Loma High School to University High School, a Catholic 
school, to finish her senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Both have defended their decisions by saying they did what was best for their 
children, and for some parents who have children in public schools that was 
reason enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in meeting the needs of individual children, and parents feel they 
have to do it in different ways," said Patty Eshleman, who has an eighth-grader 
at Roosevelt Junior High School and a first grader at Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Weber, a trustee for two years, also has a seventh-grader at Gompers Secondary 
School and Davis, an eight-year member who is leaving her spot in December, has 
a younger daughter at Point Loma High. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Davis moved her older daughter to La Jolla Country Day School for her 
junior high years. 
</P>
<P>
One parent who defended the board members said that their insider knowledge of 
the school system might have contributed to their decisions to pull their 
children out. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were that familiar with the public school system, you probably wouldn't 
want your kids educated in the public schools," said Bill Keane, who has two 
children and two stepchildren in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Keane said if he had the resources, he would put his children in private 
schools, too. 
</P>
<P>
Some longtime activists in the PTA said that Weber, an advocate of better 
programs for Latino and black students, put her son into a private school to 
get the kind of education she has been fighting to install in the city's public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very into the African-American culture and she wants to ensure that her 
children receive the education about their culture," said Denise Macias, a 
member of the Ninth District PTA, which represents schools in San Diego and 
Imperial counties. But Macias still questioned Weber's actions. "In order for 
her to make sure the rest of the African-American children receive the 
education she wants them to receive, I think she needs to keep her kids in 
there (the public system)." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four candidates running for seats on the San Diego Unifed school 
board in November criticized the trustee's actions but two others weren't as 
bothered, saying that the decisions were parental and not political. 
</P>
<P>
"I think every parent has an obligation to do the best they can for each one of 
their children and putting a child in a private school just means they think 
this is best for their particular child and they have the resources to do it," 
said Sue Braun, a school board candidate. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a kindergarten teacher at Balboa Elementary School said she would put 
her two children in Catholic school if she could afford it, for religious 
reasons, and because private schools tend to be more disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
"In a public school, you can't even look at a kid and give him the evil eye," 
said Socorro Mejia. "Kids and parents have all the rights these days." 
</P>
<P>
Another teacher, Lurie Center, who teaches math at Grant, said the two should 
not be trustees if they don't have faith in the very school system they head. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take a public office with the school system, it should indicate you 
have enough faith in that system," Center said. "And you indicate that faith by 
having your kids in the system."

JET STREAM BRINGS CLOUDS, COOL AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A low-pressure front that visited San Diego with clouds and cool temperatures 
last weekend is back this weekend, according to the National Weather Service in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The front, created Sept. 19 by cold air coming in from Canada, headed up the 
coast during the week, sprinkling rain on San Francisco and other parts of 
Northern California, forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
A strong jet stream over Canada is now deflecting the front back toward San 
Diego, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high-level winds, the low pressure is trapped over California 
and a slow warming trend will begin, Shigehara said. In the meantime, the front 
is working its way back toward San Diego with rain falling ahead of it. It 
brings a 20% chance of rain to San Diego today and through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't ignore the potential of rain, but it really won't mean much," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although rain will be sporadic, the county will be shrouded in a cloud cover 
with cool temperatures and little sunshine, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The low pressure won't affect coastal as much as inland temperatures. The norm 
for early fall, which began Sept. 22, is 76 degrees at Lindbergh Field. With 
the effects of the low pressure and the normal marine cloud cover, the 
temperature will drop to about 74. But in the inland areas such as El Cajon and 
Escondido where the norm is 84 to 88 this time of year, the mercury will 
struggle to top the 78-degree mark, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, surf is up to 4 to 5 feet with a water temperature of 69 
degrees. Temperatures will range from 68 to 73 today and over the weekend.

STATUS OF MORNINGSIDE HIGH'S ILL PRINCIPAL IS A MYSTERY TO OFFICIALS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE SCHOOL BOARD HAS BEEN UNABLE TO LEARN WHEN MALLORY MATTHEWS 
MIGHT RETURN, OR IF THEY NEED TO APPOINT AN ACTING PRINCIPAL.

Inglewood school officials are in a quandary because the principal of 
Morningside High School has been hospitalized for almost a month, but neither 
he nor his family has informed the district of the nature of his illness or how 
long he may be sick. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant principal is running the school, but school board members say they 
would appoint an acting principal if they knew that Principal Mallory Matthews 
was going to be out for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know the status of Mr. Matthews," said district spokesman Maurice 
Wiley. "Hopefully, we will hear something from the family." 
</P>
<P>
The family could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was taken to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital on Sept. 4 when he 
suffered what school officials described as a seizure during a parents' 
orientation meeting at Morningside. A hospital spokeswoman said Thursday that 
Matthews is in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Unified School District officials say that despite repeated contact 
with the family, they have been frustrated in their attempts to find out the 
extent or nature of Matthews' illness. Matthews' father, Leonard Matthews, is 
an administrator assigned to the district office. 
</P>
<P>
The school board instructed Supt. George McKenna early this month to send a 
letter to Matthews' family asking when he might return to the $55,440-a-year 
principal's post, but board members said this week they had received no 
response. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley said district officials have "no idea" about Matthews' illness. He said 
family members have said, " 'He's OK, he's doing better,' but they haven't 
given any details." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Principal Edward Brownlee has been assigned to fill in for Matthews 
during his absence, but no acting principal has been named. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, who is in his late 30s, was assistant principal at Morningside from 
1981 to 1985 before transferring to the assistant principal post at Inglewood 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was named principal in March after school board members forced the 
previous principal, Art Murray, from his job. The school has been disrupted in 
the past year by scheduling difficulties that have kept hundreds of students 
out of class and by student walkouts staged to protest campus conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, who lives near the Morningside campus, received a master's degree in 
education from Pepperdine University. In addition to his two assistant 
principal posts, he has served as Inglewood's coordinator of adult education 
and an adult eduction instructor.

SCHOOLS: COMPTON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET TO PARTICIPATE IN -- NOT JUST WATCH 
-- CLASSES AT CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills chemistry professor Oliver Seely was burning wood in 
a test tube last week to show how chemical reactions occur. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment was relatively simple, but school officials point to its wider 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
Seely and his class at the university's California Academy of Mathematics and 
Science -- a specialty high school established this semester with 120 
ninth-graders from six area school districts -- had a participating television 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Students from Dominguez High School in Compton were tuned in as part of a 
program that allows teachers and students at both schools to see and hear each 
other via a two-way television hookup. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only thing they can't do is smell the wood burning," Seely said of 
the Compton high school students. 
</P>
<P>
The audio-video link -- a cooperative effort among the university, the Compton 
Unified School District and Pacific Bell -- gives the Compton students a 
sampling of what college instruction is like, helps improve their academic 
achievement and offers them courses not available on their own campus. 
</P>
<P>
Classes are broadcast from a studio-classroom on the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
campus. A second television camera and a microphone at Dominguez High School 
allow students there to interact with the instructor and class at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell gave the college a $148,000 grant to purchase equipment and 
administer the two-year program, the second of its kind in the state. The other 
has linked Cal State Bakersfield with the mountain community of Tehachapi since 
November, 1989, phone company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakersfield link "bridged a geographical barrier of 40 miles," said Bob 
Lee, Pacific Bell executive vice president for marketing. "Here, it's not so 
much the physical distance but the psychological barriers" the Compton students 
may face concerning the difficulty of college classes or what college is like. 
</P>
<P>
University classes being broadcast to Dominguez High include one-day-a-week 
courses in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, physics and algebra, and a 
five-day-a-week German course. Plans are to offer other five-day courses in 
mathematics and science. Time is also allotted for guest speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Access to university professors allows Dominguez High School to fill staffing 
needs unmet by the Compton school district, said Laura Brown, technology 
coordinator with the district. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we did not have instructors to teach German," Brown said. "The 
university did, and now our students are able to take a German course." 
</P>
<P>
Academy freshman Staci Davis, 14, said the hookup allows her small German class 
to carry on a conversation in German with Dominguez High students "as easily as 
doing it in our small group." 
</P>
<P>
When the program started three weeks ago in Compton, academy student Jose 
Arredondo, 14, was surprised when he "looked up into the screen and there was 
my brother," Juan, 16, a junior at Dominguez High. 
</P>
<P>
Students and instructors praised the system's ability to let them interact. It 
"allows students (at Dominguez High) to participate in the class and not just 
view it as they would with one-way video," said Warren Ashley, Cal State 
Dominguez Hills' director of distance learning. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the classes broadcast to Compton will be those offered at the academy, 
which is expected to become a full-fledged high school. Ashley said the 
telecommunications link will someday allow other schools to use the academy as 
a resource. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense," he said, "the university becomes a broker" of enriched teaching 
by creating "an electronic forum" for education. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley said the program gives the university a way to recruit potential 
students, stimulate development of innovative and non-traditional teaching 
strategies and promote better relations with the community. 
</P>
<P>
Compton school officials hope to expand the system to the district's two other 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fascinated by the program here," Dominguez High Principal Ernie Roy said 
over the audio-video link during a demonstration last week. "We feel there is 
no limit to what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
University President Robert Detweiler praised the system as being on "the 
cutting edge of today's educational technology." 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a boy," Detweiler pointed out, "distant learning meant walking two 
miles to school."

TAKEOFF PATTERN MAY MUFFLE JET NOISE IN EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo residents hope to get relief from jet noise at Los Angeles 
International Airport when an experimental takeoff procedure starts next month. 
</P>
<P>
The new procedure, directed at airliners that make early turns on takeoff, will 
require departing pilots to delay the start of their left-hand turns until they 
are nearly one mile offshore. In the past, turns have been initiated 
approximately at the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
The flight procedure takes effect Oct. 18 and will continue through February. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials contend that fewer than 4% of the daily takeoffs turn over El 
Segundo or the adjoining Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. El Segundo, however, 
has long complained about the noise problem, which occurs as planes departing 
westward from the airport head for destinations to the south or east. 
</P>
<P>
The plan adds one mile to the point at which planes are required to have 
completed the turn. That distance has been increased from two miles to three. 
</P>
<P>
Hours for the test are 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 3 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
According to LAX noise abatement officer Robert Beard, this will be the fifth 
attempt to solve the early turn problem since 1986. The new procedure 
supersedes a current test, which began Aug. 23, in which turns are initiated 
shortly beyond the shoreline but still must be completed within two miles. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson said all previous attempts were "doomed to 
failure" because they had the two-mile limit for completing turns. 
</P>
<P>
"This one has a chance of working," he said. "If they go out one mile (before 
turning), they will not turn over the city." 
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of optimism and good faith, the city will cover up its hillside 
"Unsafe Area for Jets" sign that was put up at the end of 1988 to discourage 
early turns. "We're not removing it," Jacobson said. "This is a test." 
</P>
<P>
Fred O'Donnell, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, said that at the 
end of the test period, the agency will look at results of both the test that 
began in August and the new one starting in October. 
</P>
<P>
He said the agency will determine "which one can be safely done . . . in regard 
to managing aircraft and satisfying" the needs of El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Both LAX and El Segundo hope the test extending turns by one mile proves 
successful and that the FAA approves it as part of the permanent takeoff 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Beard said the airport's informal noise abatement procedure has been for 
aircraft taking off to the west to fly past the shoreline before beginning 
turns. However, the procedure has been visual and some pilots have said they 
could not see the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Under the October experiment, a signal will alert them to start the turn when 
they are nearly a mile offshore. 
</P>
<P>
In another development relating to airport noise, El Segundo will buy a 
$245,000 house in the neighborhood closest to the airport runway to use as a 
demonstration project for residential soundproofing. The city entered into a 
60-day escrow Sept. 15 to purchase the Hillcrest Avenue home. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are apprehensive about sound treatment, particularly the 
aesthetics of it," said Don Harrison, assistant to the city manager. He said 
the house will allow "people to see what it is they would be getting" if they 
soundproof their homes using current technology. 
</P>
<P>
The $511,000 demonstration project includes the cost to purchase the home and 
do soundproofing. Harrison said that, if there is money left over, other homes 
may be soundproofed. The city on Monday will receive a $408,800 FAA grant and 
provide the remainder of the funds to reach the project total. 
</P>
<P>
The money is the first installment in a long-term FAA matching grant for which 
the city has applied. All told, El Segundo is seeking $23 million to soundproof 
up to 700 homes.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS HAVE THE STARRING ROLES AT 
LA SCALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has become so common to open an Italian menu and find a listing for angel 
hair pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, virgin olive oil and fresh basil that it 
comes almost as a shock to scan a list and read a mention of spaghetti with 
meatballs. 
</P>
<P>
Dishes of that sort used to supply the raison d'etre of most local Italian 
restaurants -- and not so very long ago at that. In the San Diego of 1980, 
pasta almost invariably arrived in red sauce, except at the "Continental" 
eateries that made a production of tossing fettuccine Alfredo at table as a 
costly first course "prepared for a minimum of two," as the menus always noted. 
Any restaurant-goers who can't remember those days moved here after the Padres 
took the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
Spaghetti with meatballs can be a lyrical dish, especially on a moody day, but 
only if the sauce shows a modicum of finesse and only if the hands that shaped 
the meatballs molded them lightly, so that they seem airy and insubstantial and 
almost like dumplings. Meatballs whose heft and texture suggests that they 
might be miniature cannon balls most emphatically do not make the grade. 
</P>
<P>
All of which brings us to La Scala, a long-running Point Loma favorite whose 
kitchen has yet to acknowledge the existence of sun-dried tomatoes, radicchio 
lettuce or buckwheat pasta adorned with flash-grilled baby vegetables. The menu 
instead is the sort that ran for decades as the definitive list, back in the 
days when the vernacular described basic Italian restaurants as spaghetti 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
Spaghetti in several simple presentations does play a central role at La Scala. 
Also of some importance are mostaciolli baked with layerings of mozzarella 
cheese (the relatively austere forebear of America's macaroni and cheese), 
cannelloni and lasagna. Veal and chicken appear in all the usual guises -- alla 
Marsala, piccata, parmigiana -- and a fairly extensive seafood list offers a 
good selection of shrimp, squid, clam and mussel preparations. Like most of San 
Diego's old-style Italian houses with pizza ovens, La Scala also offers 
calzone, in this case stuffed simply with ricotta and mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list does go so far as a dish of mussels and clams steamed in 
seasoned white wine, but otherwise contents itself with a plate of prosciutto, 
Provolone and roasted peppers, and a more elaborate appetizer of cheeses, 
salami, olives, lettuce and the pungent, salty, pickled vegetable mix called 
giardiniera. This platter is portioned so generously that a small order will 
more than satisfy three guests and quite possibly overwhelm a party of two. 
</P>
<P>
Formal entrees include a dinner salad -- redundant at tables that have indulged 
in an antipasto -- that is so basic in its components as to seem the definition 
of ordinariness. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly unusual pasta offerings include baked gnocchi in meat sauce and 
shell-shaped macaroni with broccoli, a dish that, whatever its merits, has 
little chance of being served to the current occupants of the White House. 
Otherwise, the list is quite in the mainstream, and the tomato sauce that 
washes across much of it has the fragrance and flavor that, no matter what 
length of time has intervened since one's last acquaintance, always seem 
instantly familiar. A guest who ordered this sauce enriched with fresh 
mushrooms and poured over an immense platter of spaghetti pronounced himself 
thoroughly pleased. On a different occasion, the tomato sauce was equally happy 
over rigatoni, but the meatballs ordered as garnish belonged to the cannonball 
school. These tough little orbs had been packed, squashed, man-handled and 
cooked until they were dry, hard and mean, which is not much of a 
recommendation for a meatball. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the descriptions tacked on to the entree listings mention "spices" 
among the ingredients. This term, usually used in tandem with herbs on both 
menus and packaged food labels, typically means black pepper, with the herb in 
question normally nothing fancier than parsley. A server was incapable of 
defining just what the spices involved in the veal piccata might be, but there 
did seem some curious undertones of flavor in this likable presentation. It 
also varied from the norm in including egg yolk in the sauce, so that it seemed 
a sort of light but unctuous Italian hollandaise. 
</P>
<P>
The menu also specifies fresh oregano for the veal pizzaiola, a seasoning not 
employed everywhere but one that certainly would give the dish a new life. A 
more generous inclusion of meat in the veal and eggplant Sorrentino, meanwhile, 
might have added a little life to this sorry preparation, which consisted 
mostly of soggy, heavily breaded eggplant slices stewing under pools of tomato 
sauce and melted cheese. 
</P>
<P>
There are flashes of originality on the chicken list; one dish tucks a boneless 
breast and several shrimp under a coverlet of white sauce. The most unusual may 
be the saltimbocca Riccardo, a most unusual variation on the veal saltimbocca 
theme that teams baked chicken and prosciutto with tortellini in cheese sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The menu also mentions calamari parmigiana for those who like this style of 
preparation but shun meat (or really like squid), and the rather more dressy 
squid steak alla nunzia, which is sauteed with garlic and mushrooms and 
finished with a deglazing sauce of sherry and lemon juice. The frutti di mare 
alla Luigi combines various shellfish with marinara sauce and more of those 
mysterious spices, while the scampi pesto contents itself with the pungent, 
familiar basil sauce, in this case tossed with angel hair pasta. La Scala 
recently made a good pesto, but the shrimp seemed a little long in the tooth. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of desserts includes a fairly stiff zabaglione, or egg-Marsala 
custard, and rather nice cannoli in which the identity of the spice is by no 
means a mystery. The ricotta cheese filling is highly seasoned with cinnamon 
and very pleasing because of it. 
</P>
<P>
This casual but comfortable eatery is far from new, and moved to its present 
premises at Scott and Canon streets some five years ago. The restaurant's 
nearness to Shelter Island and the yacht basins ensures that on many nights the 
clientele will be a lively mix of neighborhood residents and boating 
enthusiasts.

GIRL, 11, ATTACKED ON WAY TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 11-year-old La Mesa girl was attacked and sexually assaulted on her way to 
school Thursday morning, resulting in severe bruising to her forehead and other 
injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were looking late Thursday for a white man in his late 20s, 5-foot-11, 
180 pounds, with brown, collar-length hair. 
</P>
<P>
He was described as unshaven and wearing a pink, short-sleeved shirt, faded 
Levi's and gray and white tennis shoes, a spokeswoman for the La Mesa Police 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
A composite drawing of the attacker has been released. The description was 
provided by the girl, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The assault occurred in an open area near Parkway Middle School at 9009 Park 
Plaza in La Mesa, the spokeswoman said. She added that the girl was struck 
several times during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the girl knew the attacker, Lt. Bobby Barrett said, "That 
information is not available at this time." Barrett did say the man "was 
familiar with the area." 
</P>
<P>
He said the girl was treated at a hospital.

ICE CREAM TRUCKS BECOMING A HOT SAFETY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Holloway remembers when as a kid he used to chase after the ice cream 
trucks in his Inglewood neighborhood, clutching a handful of coins. Today, 
Holloway is 27 and he's the one being chased. 
</P>
<P>
In his first day on the job as an ice cream truck driver earlier this month, 
Holloway parked outside Woodworth Elementary School in Inglewood -- the same 
school he once attended -- and waited for the children to come streaming out. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was hot, and Holloway soon had a line of pint-sized customers 
inquiring about his ice cream and candy treats. 
</P>
<P>
One girl in pigtails asked to examine the Starbursts, Butterfingers and 
Ghostbusters chewy candies. None of them were just right. After finally 
settling on two 50-cent candy pops, the girl left the truck, strolled down the 
street, spun around, came back and said, "Can I have my dollar back?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," Holloway said, giving her the refund and accepting back the pops. "Come 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Indecisive youngsters are one of the minor problems facing ice cream truck 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
A big one is the increasing number of traffic accidents involving their young 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Area legislators are considering bans or restrictions on ice cream trucks, and 
the trucks' electronic bells, that irresistible lure to children, are getting 
on the nerves of some adults too. 
</P>
<P>
"We cite kids for going down the street with their car radios blasting, but 
these ice cream trucks have the same sound and we allow them to do the same 
thing," said Inglewood Councilman Garland Hardeman, who has called on city 
officials to regulate the noise and investigate the safety issue. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, calling the trucks "a clear and present danger to children," in 1986 
became the only South Bay city to ban ice cream trucks after a young girl was 
killed in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Carson officials say the community is making do just fine without the trucks. 
Residents call the city, not to complain of the ban, but to report renegade ice 
cream trucks to the authorities, said Larry Olsen, Carson's public safety 
director. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the safety issue came up last fall when a 6-year-old Wilmington 
girl's leg was broken in a double hit-and-run. She ran across Marine Street to 
join her 10-year-old sister and was struck by an ice cream truck backing down 
the street. After knocking the little girl down, the driver pulled away, 
apparently unaware of what had happened. Then a second vehicle hit the girl, 
and that driver sped off. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said at the time that the city 
should consider more regulation of the trucks or even an outright ban. Talks 
between Los Angeles city officials and representatives of the ice cream truck 
industry have continued since. 
</P>
<P>
Aides say the two sides have reached general consensus on some safety measures: 
requiring an audible backup alarm, increasing the distance from schools where 
the trucks may be parked, requiring the truck operators to set out traffic 
cones when stopped, mandating special police permits for the trucks and raising 
fines for violators. 
</P>
<P>
George Iwai, who runs an ice cream truck business in downtown Los Angeles and 
is trying to form a local association of operators, said improving safety 
around the trucks is in everyone's interest. Banning the trucks is too drastic 
a step, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had ice cream trucks ding-a-linging on the streets for 50 years or 
more," he said. "Banning them would take a little culture and heritage away. On 
hot days, the kids are out waiting for us." 
</P>
<P>
Many cities have found a way around banning the trucks from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
After a fatal accident in Santa Ana in 1984, city officials required ice cream 
truck operators to carry $1 million in liability insurance and provide 
photographs and fingerprints of drivers for background checks. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Transportation took up the issue in 1978. Its study of 
ice cream truck safety in Detroit said that installing flashing lights on the 
trucks and a swing-down arm saying "Stop -- If Safe, Then Go" decreased 
accidents significantly. The city had an average of 48 pedestrian accidents per 
year before the ordinance and 11 after it was put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach has its own unique regulation method. 
</P>
<P>
It requires the trucks to find a regular parking place while dispensing ice 
cream. City officials say the trucks, like the parking spots, are hard to find.

GOVERNOR VETOES BAN ON CROAKER FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second straight year, Gov. George Deukmejian has rejected legislation 
to ban the commercial harvest of white croaker fish off the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
In a veto message Thursday, Deukmejian described the latest bill, written by 
Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), as unnecessary because the state 
Department of Fish and Game has closed the area to commercial white croaker 
fishing under emergency regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he expects the fishing ban to become permanent. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "The Department of Health Services has also issued a health advisory 
to sport anglers against the consumption of white croaker taken from the 
affected area." 
</P>
<P>
The ban on commercial fishing was ordered in May after a state Department of 
Health Services study determined that white croaker in Peninsula waters pose an 
unacceptable cancer risk because they contain excessive levels of DDT and PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
But Colleen Beamish, a Rosenthal aide, maintained that the administrative ban 
is inadequate because it is more easily subject to appeals and protests than a 
statute enacted by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a law . . . it's a lot more difficult to challenge," Beamish said. "We 
want to make sure the closure is permanent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on what happens to the emergency administrative ban, Rosenthal may 
reintroduce the proposal next year, Beamish said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also had sponsored a similar bill that cleared the Legislature last 
year but was vetoed by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ban, ordered in May, affects state waters from Point Fermin to 
Point Vicente. The fishing prohibition expired earlier this week but was 
renewed for another 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
The state health department study found that if white croaker taken from 
Peninsula waters were eaten once a week over a lifetime they could cause up to 
one additional cancer per 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have argued that the findings were based on an inaccurate assumption, 
saying it is unlikely consumers will eat only one species of fish, all from the 
same source, for their entire lifetime.

QUESTIONS ABOUT SCHOOL REFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is indeed unfortunate that The Times, even in printing a correction of 
previously published misinformation erroneously identifying one of our schools 
as the site of a shooting, continues to allude to the involvement of a school 
in the tragic death of a child. Your Sept. 13, 1990, "For the Record" article 
stated that "the suspect reportedly took the gun to school that day," and also 
that "the shooting took place after school," which are unnecessary references 
to the school in the reporting of the incident. More appropriately, the time of 
the incident should have been specified without a reference to school; and the 
alleged report that the gun was on campus is unverified and unnecessary in this 
reference by The Times.

CYCLE SHOP SPURS NOISE COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not a writer, but I am going to attempt this letter to bring out several 
points of interest that were never mentioned in various articles on South Bay 
Cycles. 
</P>
<P>
Co-owner of the business William Campbell applied for and received a 
conditional-use permit to operate a car leasing agency. 
</P>
<P>
Several neighbors were opposed to this, while Jerry Compton highly supported 
it. The city and neighbors were led to believe that a car brokerage was to 
open. Near the shop's completion, signs were put up saying South Bay 
Cycles-Harley-Davidson parts and accessories. Needless to say, the neighbors 
were shocked. After several neighborhood complaints to the city, Mr. Campbell 
then, and only then, attempted to obtain the necessary permit for a motorcycle 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
The shop is presently selling Harley-Davidson apparel, and there is already too 
much noise and traffic related to Harley-Davidsons in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The shop owners keep saying "give us a chance" to let them open and show that 
they can control the noise and traffic. There has already been an increase in 
traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
These shop owners have not been fair. They have already had confrontations with 
neighbors. It was only when the neighbors really started opposing, with 
petitions of over 100 signatures, that the shop owners attempted to try and win 
them over. A bit late. 
</P>
<P>
I, as a concerned neighbor, am opposed to the opening of this shop. I see no 
way of controlling the increase in noise and traffic it will have throughout 
Hermosa.

SURPRISE OUT OF THE BLUE CHILLS ONE FAMILY'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An airmail, special-delivery "package" nearly razed the roof at the Padillas' 
house Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
There was no return address on the unwanted bundle, but smelly blue clues 
pointed to the not-so-friendly skies. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Padilla, 39, said he was watching television with his two daughters and a 
friend at about 8 p.m. when his West Los Angeles bungalow started to shake. 
</P>
<P>
Like a bolt from the wild blue yonder, something burst through the roof, 
splintered rafters and punched out a chunk of plaster in a bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
"I went outside and there was ice on the front porch," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
A two-foot-square hole was in the roof of the Granville Avenue home, and 
melting ice discolored the ceiling of his daughters' room. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all kind of shook up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ice was part of a 1 1/2-by-2 1/2-foot chunk of what is euphemistically 
known as "blue ice." Several large pieces were in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Padilla said he had never heard of blue ice, so he did what any 
sensible person with a homeowner's insurance policy would do: He put the frozen 
matter in plastic bags and stored it in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has found out that "blue ice" is a block of frozen waste 
products from an airplane toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the sewage, colored blue by a chemical in the water, seeps through a 
faulty seal and collects on the outside of the plane. Then, when the air 
temperature rises, it can drop off and interrupt a quiet evening at home. 
</P>
<P>
It's not an everyday occurrence, but this is at least the seventh fall of blue 
ice in Southern California in the past two years, according to the Federal 
Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the waste is siphoned from the plane with a hose -- after the plane 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the offending airplane, with thousands of commercial flights over the 
Los Angeles Basin each day, is virtually impossible, FAA spokesman Fred 
O'Donnell said. By the time the plane lands, he said, there are no telltale 
signs that the seal has leaked, and no distinctive odor. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell offered one piece of advice: The blue ice could pose a health hazard. 
"It's just not the kind of thing you want in the refrigerator," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla thanks his lucky stars that no one was killed or injured. 
</P>
<P>
But he is also wondering if it was a quirk of fate, or his personal karma, that 
frozen waste matter, blue or otherwise, landed on his roof. 
</P>
<P>
"It must have been one of my unhappy customers," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla is a plumber.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Change Defense Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 156 to 254, the House rejected a conservative-led attempt to 
soften military personnel cuts and increase from 180 to 360 days the maximum 
active duty time for reservists. This occurred as the House sent to conference 
with the Senate the Pentagon's first post-Cold War budget, a $283-billion 
fiscal 1991 spending bill that is $24 billion under President Bush's request. 
</P>
<P>
The current uniformed personnel ceiling is 1.9 million. This motion sought to 
lower it by about 101,500 troops, not 130,000 as recommended by the 
Democratic-led Armed Services Committee. Bush wants a cut of 38,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
The longer deployment of reservists would have permitted reserve combat units 
to be sent to the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon finds the present 180-day limit 
not long enough to justify combat roles for reservists, given how long it takes 
to put them in place. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Army personnel should not be deeply cut 
while "the Army is the primary provider of troop strength in Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly B. Byron (D-Md.) said the Persian Gulf crisis should not be used "as an 
excuse to backslide" on needed personnel cuts. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to soften military personnel cuts and double the active duty 
time for reservists. 
</P>

To Cut SDI Funding 
</P>
<P>
The House voted, 225 to 189, to lower Strategic Defense Initiative funding to a 
maintenance level of $2.3 billion for fiscal 1991, about half of President 
Bush's request for the proposedspace-based defense against incoming missiles. 
The vote occurred during debate on the 1991 Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Tom Ridge (R-Pa.) said: "The SDI mission continues to evolve -- the 
leakproof shield is history and now we are only discussing enhanced 
deterrence."

Opponent Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) asked why SDI backers "have to keep 
promising members that if New York disappears off the face of the map with some 
Saddam Hussein bomb, we are not supposed to say to you, 'We told you so."' 
</P>

A yes vote was to cut SDI spending to a maintenance level.

Abortion Issue

<P>
By a vote of 200 to 216, the House rejected an amendment permitting women in 
the military or who are dependents to receive an abortion at military 
facilities abroad if they pay for it. The amendment to the 1991 defense bill 
(above) sought to lift a Department of Defense ban on such abortions.

care for women defending freedom "in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere throughout 
the world."

<P>
Opponent Barbara F. Vucanovich (R-Nev.) said the amendment would lead to 
"abortion on demand at any overseas (military) installation."

AT THE GALLERIES: ARTIST NANCY KITTREDGE TAKES A PAGE FROM THE FAUVIST LEGACY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the early years of this century, painters Henri Matisse and Maurice De 
Vlaminck launched a style that became known as Fauvism for its wild, autonomous 
color. The two artists also played the violin together, but at a certain point 
in their musical relationship, Matisse bowed out. Vlaminck, it seemed, insisted 
on playing fortissimo all of the time. 
</P>
<P>
This snippet of art history brings much to bear on the current show of Nancy 
Kittredge's work at the David Zapf Gallery (2400 Kettner Blvd.), through Oct. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Kittredge's use of hot, vivid color owe much to the Fauvist 
legacy, but, like Vlaminck's playing, Kittredge's painting shrieks with a high 
intensity that never lets up. Searing reds and shocking greens smother nearly 
every canvas, piling on the tension but offering no relief. 
</P>
<P>
Christian themes such as the fall of man and the offering of Communion appear, 
as do such religious symbols as crosses and fish. Many of the paintings and 
pastel drawings in the show can also be read in more universal terms, as images 
of individuals on personal journeys of enlightenment. Yet the passionate 
physicality of Kittredge's palette seems to be at odds with the cool 
spirituality of her images. 
</P>
<P>
In "Uncharted Course," two women in a boat float down a grass-lined canal, 
quiet and contemplative. In "The Blue Triangle," a pair of silhouetted figures 
stand in awe at a vision of the geometric form hovering in a luminous cloud. In 
her notes to the show, Kittredge points out that the blue triangle represents 
the Holy Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
Whether gazing at symbols in the sky or at each other, the figures in 
Kittredge's paintings are always statuesque and stoic, their expressions 
absently fixed in the middle distance. "I accept the fact that we live on two 
different spheres and that we are going on to something different and have been 
somewhere else," Kittredge is quoted as saying in the 1988 book, "San Diego 
Artists." Indeed, her characters do seem to exist in an amorphous space between 
realms, pondering the spiritual threshold before them. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, however, this quiet narrative is clothed in an ill-fitting costume 
of scorching color. While the Fauves used strong color to give their paintings 
a rawness and immediacy, Kittredge seems to use her intense palette more out of 
habit than anything else, and the work suffers from a cloying sameness as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
ART NOTES . . . 
</P>
<P>
The artists who have been designing posters for the Royal Chicano Air Force 
have one foot in the old, spiritually-charged world of pre-Colombian pyramids 
and the other in the brash present. In their work, symbols of Aztec and Mayan 
gods mingle with proclamations of political power, calls for boycotts and 
announcements of community events. 
</P>
<P>
A spirited collection of posters by the RCAF can be seen through October 14 at 
the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park. The group, founded in Sacramento 
in 1968 by three artists, was intended "as a political action organizing body 
to express personal visions of Chicano rights through the magic of art." 
</P>
<P>
This retrospective look at the RCAF's efforts, from the collection of 
co-founder Ricardo Favela, reaches from the mundane to the militant. Benign 
posters announcing concerts hang next to sterner statements of solidarity with 
the United Farm Workers. The show resonates with nostalgia, though the roots 
and reasons for the movement remain very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
DeLoss McGraw, whose wry, whimsical works have both inspired and been inspired 
by poetry, has completed a new book. "Janet and DeLoss: Poems and Pictures" 
pairs five new poems and four translations from the Japanese by San Franciscan 
Janet Lewis with woodcuts by the San Diego-based artist. The book was published 
in an edition of 90 by Brighton Press, the local printmaking atelier that has 
published four other books illustrated by McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego artists on the move: Sculptor Anne Mudge and installation artist 
Mario Lara are included in the four-person show, "Ancient Stillness/Ancient 
Silence," at the Biota Gallery in West Hollywood, through October 13. The show 
was organized by Katya Williamson, formerly curator of public art for the 
Carlsbad Arts Office. . . . Joyce Cutler-Shaw is currently featured in an 
exhibition at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, The Netherlands. The show, titled 
"In Flight/Op Wieken," continues through November 24.

TRATORIA'S PIZZAS HAVE PLENTY OF PIZAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a reason why Carlo and Rita DeDionisio and Luciano Carlucci have called 
their restaurant Trattoria de Roma: They are all from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The food, however, isn't; the origins of these dishes run up and down the 
Italian boot from the Alps to Sicily. There's nothing noticeably Roman about 
the stretch of Ventura Boulevard just west of Reseda Boulevard either. And this 
little place tucked away in a corner of a mini-mall called Topanga Town Plaza 
is not really a trattoria. So I feel justified in saying that Trattoria de Roma 
has a somewhat misleading name. 
</P>
<P>
The interior features pictures of lots of places in Rome where tourists hang 
out (fountain of Trevi, Coliseum, etc.). It is upbeat and breezy, with a flashy 
open counter area, glass-topped tables with pastel green tablecloths and plants 
in the long window sills. A tape of a tenor singing Puccini seems to play 
constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the lunch menu is short, my favorite dishes here can be 
found on it. Something called a mini-pizza eggplant sandwich is a wonderful 
surprise, a flying saucer-shaped creation consisting of two cracker-thin crusts 
of pizza dough with a filling of diced eggplant and melted mozzarella cheese. 
The top is brushed with virgin olive oil and sprinkled with a little rosemary 
and the whole thing is cut into fourths. It's simply one of the best lunch 
dishes anywhere in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Several panini, Italian-style sandwiches, make good lunches too. Al taglio, 
with imported cold cuts, would be my choice, but al tonno, an oily tuna 
sandwich with lettuce, tomato and onion, is another winner. So is the eggplant 
sandwich, a filling concoction of breaded, sauteed eggplant. All are served on 
hot crusty loaves of Italian bread. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner menu is more extensive -- but less impressive. Antipasti, often the 
best part of an Italian meal, are not taken too seriously here. The house 
Caesar is limp, with chopped greens (as opposed to broken ones) and a dressing 
that is watery. Bruschetta, ordinarily grilled bread that is brushed with olive 
oil and topped with garlic, tomato and basil, is perfunctory, as if a topping 
of tomato and basil had simply been dumped onto premade garlic bread. And pasta 
e fagioli, the classic Roman bean and pasta soup, was unavailable when I asked 
for it. I had to settle for a beanless minestrone instead, a tasty, innocuous 
mixture of diced carrot, zucchini and celery in a tarragon-scented tomato 
broth. 
</P>
<P>
Pasta and pizza save the day. Pastas are not made here, but the restaurant gets 
high marks for its preparation. Penne arrabbiata is delicious -- tubular pasta 
in a spicy sauce that brings a flush to your face. The kitchen cooks the pasta 
until it is perfectly al dente. Linguini contadina, a lunch dish, is a resonant 
combination of garlic, fresh mushrooms and herbs. It is not on the menu at 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzas are especially good here, 10-inch or 15-inch masterpieces consisting of 
a crisp crust and a variety of interesting toppings. Checca -- raw tomato, 
mozzarella, basil and garlic -- tastes like what you hope for when you order a 
good bruschetta; the flavors are integrated and the combination is 
irresistible. Patate, a peasant dish from the north, has cheese, sliced potato 
and rosemary, without tomato sauce. And calzone ripieno, a gooey pouch of 
ricotta, egg, prosciutto and Parmesan, makes a worthy alternative to the 
pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
Secondi piatti, entrees, aren't as compelling as the primi. Saltimbocca, a true 
Roman favorite, is prepared without much style. It's sauteed veal with thick 
slices of salty prosciutto, in a weak sauce with limp mushrooms and too much 
Marsala. Pollo cacciatora, chicken in marinara sauce with black olives and bell 
peppers, is insipid; the chicken is overcooked and the olives are from a can. 
Try pesce spada (swordfish) instead. It's firm and fine. 
</P>
<P>
Also save room for the big dessert, Rita DeDionisio's special tiramisu. This 
dessert, which is often terribly tired, is done with real flair here. It's a 
sweet, dense, creamy version loaded with rum, mascarpone and cream. It's a 
dessert that Rome would be proud to call its own. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: mini-pizza eggplant sandwich, $5.50; panino al taglio, 
$4.50; pizza patate, $6.50 (10 inches), and $11.50 (15 inches); pesce spada, 
$13.95; tiramisu, $4.

<P>
RADIO: THE U.S. MILITARY IS BROADCASTING NEWS, SPORTS AND FEATURES, BUT NO 
RELIGION, TO SOLDIERS STATIONED IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
United States soldiers in Saudi Arabia may not be getting their MTV, but due to 
some quick maneuvers by the Armed Forces Radio Television Service, they are now 
receiving radio newscasts from home. 
</P>
<P>
"We are up and running with five transmitters in the area," said Col. Richard 
Fuller, deputy commander for operations at the AFRTS broadcast center in Sun 
Valley. The center oversees the radio and television programming that goes out 
to U.S. military personnel via satellite around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, AFRTS had no broadcast facilities in the Middle 
East and transmissions from its closest transmitter, in Turkey, could not be 
picked up in Saudi Arabia. (AFRTS uses the standard broadcast bands, which do 
not carry nearly as far as shortwave.) During the first month of troop 
movements into Saudi Arabia, military personnel had to go without the news- and 
sports-laden programming on AFRTS. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there were other things that had to come first, like military 
equipment, food, housing and basic services," Fuller said. "But our people 
moved as fast as we could to get on the air with what our military personnel 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to know what was going on in the world, especially in the gulf. 
And they wanted sports." 
</P>
<P>
The first AFRTS transmitter in Saudi Arabia went on the air Sept. 12. That gave 
at least some of the troops in the area access to AFRTS' roster that is packed 
with newscasts from almost every major U.S. source, including ABC, CBS, NBC, 
National Public Radio, the Mutual Broadcasting System and the radio divisions 
of the Associated Press and United Press International wire services. 
</P>
<P>
On weekdays, the top of the hour typically begins with from one to six 
newscasts, plus news features and commentary. 
</P>
<P>
"We take them right from the source, exactly as they are heard here except that 
we don't run the commercials," Fuller said. "There is no censorship 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Second only to the amount of news on the AFRTS broadcast roster is sports, with 
updates and features from a variety of sources. Additionally, the schedule is 
regularly preempted to present live broadcasts of sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the schedule are business, health and science features, and short 
programs produced by the various service branches. 
</P>
<P>
Five AFRTS transmitters are operational, giving almost all the U.S. troops in 
the area access to the programming. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the transmitters on the air was more a diplomatic than a logistics 
problem, said Col. Joe Cook, deputy assistant director of AFRTS. "The primary 
concern was that we were doing everything in coordination with the Saudi 
Arabian government," said Cook, speaking from AFRTS headquarters in Washington. 
"They wanted to know what would be broadcast and how it would be done. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing really unusual about that. If a foreign government came here 
and said it wanted to set up transmitters to broadcast in our country, we'd 
want to know what was going on too." The Saudis control the power allotment for 
the transmitters and the frequencies on which they broadcast, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi government officials had no problem with the vast majority of the AFRTS 
broadcast schedule. "They were concerned that we stick to news and sports and 
since that is our mission, too, it was no problem," Cook said. But the Saudis 
did not want any programs of a religious nature broadcast in their primarily 
Islamic country. 
</P>
<P>
Before AFRTS went on the air there, three shows were removed from its roster, 
including two short, weekly programs of religious news. The third was the 
twice-weekly, half-hour "Focus on the Family," a program produced by a 
conservative Christian organization based in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"Focus on the Family," which is broadcast daily over 1,500 stations in the 
United States, had been on AFRTS since 1983 in edited form. "We had always 
given AFRTS a special version that was devoid of religious content," said Mike 
Trout, senior vice president of the Christian media empire named after the 
program, which features organization founder James Dobson discussing family 
issues. "The root of what we believe and the content of the show is found in 
the Bible," Trout said, "but some of the programs do not have an overt 
religious content. We go through these programs and further cut out any comment 
that is religious, such as the mention of a Scripture passage. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the programs we provide AFRTS," he said, adding that he is hopeful 
the program will soon be reinstated in the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Castle, the civilian chief of AFRTS' radio division, sympathizes with 
Trout. "We had always considered the show to be more about family counseling 
than about religion," Castle said. "But orders came from on high that all 
programs with even an appearance of an association with religion should be 
taken off the broadcast schedule. We wanted to be very careful, understandably, 
not to risk offending the Saudis." 
</P>
<P>
"Focus on the Family" continues to be sent to AFRTS studios at military 
facilities worldwide as part of a non-broadcast feed. The personnel at these 
local outlets can tape the show and weave it into the regular AFRTS schedule at 
their discretion. 
</P>
<P>
In coming weeks, the troops in Saudi Arabia will have their own mobile studio 
facilities, which will allow AFRTS radio entertainment programs, produced at 
the Sun Valley facility and sent out in a non-broadcast feed or by mail, to be 
inserted into the schedule. And if all goes smoothly, the troops will be able 
to see news and entertainment programs from the AFRTS TV service too. 
</P>
<P>
"With luck in the next month, there is a chance we can have some limited 
television in the area," Cook said. "We have been working with the Saudis to 
establish some low-wattage, directional television that would be only for the 
troops in isolated areas. That way, it would not interfere with Saudi TV."

U.S. REPORTEDLY PLEDGES TO DEFEND ISRAEL AGAINST IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GOSHKO, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has assured Israel that if the Jewish state is attacked by 
Iraq, the United States "will stand by its commitment to Israel's security" and 
retaliate against Iraq even if that requires military force, U.S. and other 
diplomatic sources said here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the assurance was given by Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy at a meeting here late Wednesday. 
The sources added that Baker acted to calm Israeli concern about threats made 
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last Sunday to strike at Israel and oil 
installations in Saudi Arabia if Iraq suffers unduly from the economic embargo 
imposed against it by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Levy did not specifically request the assurance, the sources said, but Baker 
gave what one source called "a promise that the United States will stand by its 
commitment to Israel's security" in an apparent bid to to head off a possible 
Israeli attempt to take the issue to the Security Council. After Hussein 
threatened Israel on Sunday, Levy raised the possibility of making a protest to 
the council, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the United States would prefer that Israel maintain the low 
profile it has kept since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and not disturb the 
coalition of Arab states that the United States has put together in opposition 
to Hussein. However, the sources said, Baker wanted to make clear that even if 
the coalition with the Arabs is damaged by the United States' overtly aiding 
Israel, the U.S. commitment remains unshakable. 
</P>
<P>
The sources also pointed to statements made before Congress on Tuesday by John 
Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, as a veiled 
hint of the U.S. stance. They said Kelly did not make a specific pledge to come 
to Israel's aid militarily but told members of Congress that the United States 
would consider an attack against Israel as a very serious matter requiring 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The sources also said U.S. officials do not consider it likely that Hussein 
would launch an attack against Israel exclusively, even if the Iraqi leader was 
to try to marshal support in the Arab world capable of splitting the coalition 
arrayed against him. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they said, such an attack probably would come as part of a decision by 
Iraq to strike in several directions, possibly including Saudi Arabia, and 
would almost certainly bring all-out war between Hussein and the multinational 
force deployed in the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview Thursday, Levy said the United States has agreed to 
explore with Israeli military experts whether a proposed sale of advanced U.S. 
weapons to Saudi Arabia will erode Israel's qualitative military edge in the 
Middle East and, if so, what must be done to restore it. 
</P>
<P>
"I put forward (to Baker) a proposal to have experts from Israel come over and 
have a close look at whether the qualitative edge is being maintained," said 
Levy, here for the U.N. General Assembly's annual session. "I'm quite convinced 
there was understanding of the logic and justice of this request. And I can 
tell you it will be done." 
</P>
<P>
Washington's plan for new arms sales to Saudi Arabia and U.S. desires for 
Israel to keep a low profile have caused anxiety in Israel that it is losing 
out as the main U.S. ally in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
While Levy did not say so in the interview, other sources familiar with the 
Wednesday meeting said it began on a chilly note with Baker complaining angrily 
that Israel has not been helpful to the Administration's hopes of getting the 
Saudi sale through Congress without problems. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the sources said, Baker charged that Israeli Defense Minister 
Moshe Arens, on a recent visit to Washington, left the impression he understood 
how important the sale was for Administration policy. Then, Baker reportedly 
said, Arens returned home and assailed the sale as a threat to Israeli 
security. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Baker also complained that Levy, Arens and other Israeli 
Cabinet officials were creating confusion by bombarding Washington with 
differing lists of what they contend Israel needs as compensation for the Saudi 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
"This tremendous amount of armaments being offered to Saudi Arabia has raised 
eyebrows about Saudi Arabia's capabilities and needs," Levy said. "Who can 
guarantee with surety what might happen tomorrow with these arms. They are 
disturbing questions. They need to be raised, and we raised them." 
</P>
<P>
Levy also said he made clear to Baker Israel's feeling that it should be 
forgiven its $4.5 billion military aid debt to the United States, if the 
Administration forgives Egypt's $7.5 billion debt because it is contributing to 
the forces arrayed in Saudi Arabia against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not envious of Egypt, but our situation is no less serious because of 
the gulf crisis," he said. "Our security burdens have increased greatly. So we 
feel that if the implications of the crisis on the economies of countries like 
Egypt and Turkey warrant relief, the same should apply to Israel. One should 
not ignore that." 
</P>
<P>
Levy acknowledged that Washington's request for a low Israeli profile, made 
within hours after Iraq's invasion, had caused "a malaise about U.S.-Israeli 
relations" in his country. 
</P>
<P>
"The low profile was pursued so vigorously by Washington that it was made to 
seem Israel had vanished from the region," he said.

OIL TRADERS UNSWAYED BY BUSH'S WORDS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush most likely had the frenetic traders of the New York Mercantile 
Exchange in mind Wednesday when he decried the "unwarranted speculation" that 
has driven oil prices ever higher since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But if Bush's harsh words bothered anybody at the exchange, it was hardly 
evident Thursday morning as trading in the crowded oil futures pit began. The 
action started with an explosion of shouts and gestures at 9:45 a.m., and it 
was clear within minutes that oil prices were headed up -- just where the 
President didn't want them to go. 
</P>
<P>
"People complain about speculation -- even powerful people," said Pavel Pojdl, 
a trader and analyst with 10 years at the exchange. "In the end, prices just go 
where they go." 
</P>
<P>
The traders and investors of this exchange have heard intermittent complaints 
about speculation since the NYMEX -- the world's largest oil futures market -- 
was launched in 1983. But the complaints have done little to affect prices, or 
to alter the exchange's growing importance as the centerpiece of the global 
system of pricing oil. 
</P>
<P>
The futures contracts the traders swap are, in effect, promises to deliver 
specified amounts of oil at specified times between next month and 18 months 
from now. Those prices also have a direct bearing on what is charged for oil 
today in the current or "spot" market, which is what made the President so 
unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
When the price of NYMEX's benchmark West Texas crude reached $38.67 on 
Wednesday, Bush warned of those "who might take advantage of the crisis . . . 
to drive up the price of oil." On Thursday, the market carried the price 
further, with November crude closing at $39.54 a barrel, after reaching an 
all-time high of $40.10. 
</P>
<P>
These prices are based in part on the prices asked by producers, such as OPEC 
nations. But they also reflect such other factors as political developments, 
natural disasters and simply the hunches of investors. 
</P>
<P>
If this process makes the President unhappy, the traders insist their buying 
and selling helps the economy in a variety of ways -- for example, by allowing 
companies to buy future supplies of oil to reduce their risks from future price 
hikes. The market also helps to remove uncertainty about where prices are 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
These days, some economists say the futures market's presence may make this oil 
crisis a lot easier on the economy than the oil shocks of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The NYMEX consists of six small trading amphitheaters called "pits" where 
hundreds of men and women shout, gesticulate and wave slips of paper at each 
other in an effort to get the best prices for their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Above the pits on all sides are electronic displays showing the ever-changing 
prices; beside the pits are clerks who keep the floor traders and brokers in 
contact with customers and associates outside the exchange floor. 
</P>
<P>
The floor traders aren't just buying and selling for themselves, of course, but 
for customers of all kinds around the globe -- oil companies, airlines, heating 
oil distributors and others. These companies buy and sell contracts to offset 
the risk that they will lose money from a sharp run-up in price. And, yes, 
other players in the market speculate for profit. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Thursday, a number of traders said they understood the 
President's efforts to try to talk down the price of oil. They said they 
understood that "speculators" are often the target of politicians -- as when 
President Richard M. Nixon damned currency speculators in the 1970s for the 
dollar's gyrations. 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't have much patience with arguments that their buying and selling 
has hurt the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand that the President has to appear concerned how oil prices are 
affecting the country," said Michael Wilner, a 35-year-old trader who heads his 
own firm. "But this kind of talk can go too far. It would be unfair to suggest 
greedy, unmitigated speculation is going to freeze a lot of people in 
Appalachia this year." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, is among the 
economists who believe the presence of the futures markets will make this oil 
"shock" easier for the economy to handle. All those people buying and selling 
mean that prices get where they're going much quicker, removing much 
uncertainty for energy users. 
</P>
<P>
"What used to take six months now takes six hours," Yergin said. 
</P>
<P>
This price-setting process is highly volatile and for that reason can be 
unsettling. But it also helps bring buyers and sellers together and thus can 
help prevent shortages, according to Yergin. 
</P>
<P>
William Hogan, director of the Energy and Environmental Policy Center at 
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said the 1979 oil 
crisis brought only small reductions in oil supplies. But hoarding made the 
problem more severe. 
</P>
<P>
Now, futures markets enable those who are worried about the risks of future 
price boosts to offset the risks with contracts, Hogan says. After the current 
crisis, if the country does not suffer gigantic disruptions, "we will conclude 
that the futures markets played a very important . . . role." 
</P>
<P>
In Bush's view, the futures markets have been acting irrationally because they 
have been driving up prices at a time when there has been no change in world 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
To NYMEX's traders, however, the futures market have been reacting rationally 
to growing expectations that war in the Persian Gulf will interrupt supplies 
from the world's largest oil-producing region. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see the secretary of defense on TV and he says our blockade is really 
affecting the Iraqis, it's rational for me to believe war's more likely 
tomorrow than it was today," trader Wilner says. 
</P>
<P>
Some traders acknowledged the truth of one of the President's suggestions -- 
many have been making more money in the market since the Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"This has made it a good year for a lot of people," said David Huemer, an 
independent floor trader with eight years at the exchange. "In fact, some 
people are changing their idea of what a good year is." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the greater profitability is simply greater volatility -- 
enabling a smart and nimble trader to reap larger returns by buying and selling 
futures contracts. Today, for example, the price of a barrel of crude 
fluctuated $2.40 from low to high, Huemer noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, prices move less in eight months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But increased volatility means increased risk, and the ham-handed trader can 
easily lose his shirt.

COMPENSATION FOR RADIATION VICTIMS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After hearing emotional appeals to right "one of the great wrongs that we 
Americans committed against our own citizens," the House gave final 
congressional approval Thursday to legislation that compensates radiation 
victims of nuclear weapons testing and uranium mining. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, expected to be signed by President Bush, provides $50,000 each to 
stricken "down winders" in Nevada, Arizona and Utah who were exposed to fallout 
from open-air bomb testing between 1951 and 1958 and for a one-month period in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also gives $100,000 each to uranium miners -- many of them Navajo 
Indians -- who were exposed to massive doses of radiation as they helped mine 
fuel for nuclear bomb production from 1947 to 1971. The mines were in Colorado, 
New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
From 600 to 1,100 people who lived down wind of the tests or their survivors 
are expected to qualify for payments that cover a list of radiation-related 
illnesses, primarily cancer. From 300 to 500 miners or their survivors are 
believed eligible for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"The government made a decision to bomb these people to whom the government 
makes an apology and a small compensatory payment today," Rep. Wayne Owens 
(D-Utah) said shortly before the House took final action by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) said: "This is an opportunity to 
compensate for one of the great wrongs that we Americans committed against our 
own citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lived in the affected areas and contracted specific diseases, 
primarily cancers, qualifies for benefits. But the House went along with 
earlier Senate changes primarily intended to screen out miners who may have 
contracted their illnesses from heavy smoking. Miners may face an investigator 
who will challenge their claims if they smoked. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, whose brother-in-law died from cancer linked to radiation exposure, said 
that the government should be held accountable because it purposely neglected 
to tell people of the dangers. Owens and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) were 
prime sponsors of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The government knew these people were being poisoned by nuclear fallout," said 
Owens, who represented a group of victims who initially won a damage suit in 
federal court but lost when the government appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. James H. Bilbray (D-Nev.) recalled that, as a boy in Las Vegas, he went 
atop a mountain with a Boy Scout troop to watch a blast 70 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"We would turn away, watch the skies change colors and feel the caress of the 
breeze. We were not told we were in danger of exposure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray also described the case of a Bunkerville, Nev., woman, Gloria 
Gregerson. As a young girl, she was told by government test officials at a 
school assembly that "there was nothing to worry about -- but if a radioactive 
cloud comes over, wash your clothes twice and if you get anything on your skin, 
wash it off with hot water," Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was among children who sometimes shook snow-like radioactive ash off 
oleander bushes and got it on themselves, he continued. At the age of 17, 
Gloria Gregerson contracted cancer. She lived to be 42. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the government covered up and outright lied," Bilbray said. "Now it 
is time for the government to make amends." 
</P>
<P>
To receive compensation, victims would have to have been in downwind areas for 
at least two years (one year for childhood leukemia). Also, they would have to 
have contracted the disease at least five years after the first exposure to 
radiation (between two and 30 years for those with leukemia). 
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would cost taxpayers 
$108 million over the next five years if Congress appropriates the full amount 
authorized in the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), floor manager of the bill, insisted that the 
Justice Department begin processing claims even if appropriations lag. However, 
a key Republican, Rep. Craig T. James of Florida, said that Justice officials 
may not feel obliged to do so. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 220,000 military personnel and 150,000 civilians were exposed to 
radiation when the government conducted atmospheric testing of atomic weapons 
from 1945 to 1963. They and their surviving dependents receive disability 
benefits for the 13 categories of cancer associated with radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
People down wind from the test site have claimed that the government 
negligently failed to warn them of any danger. Although a federal district 
court in 1984 found the government to be negligent, an appellate panel ruled 
that the government could not be held liable. 
</P>
<P>
In cases involving the uranium miners, the appellate court made a similar 
ruling but suggested that the miners seek redress from Congress.

SHARP DIFFERENCES EMERGE BETWEEN WILSON, FEINSTEIN; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE CANDIDATES HAVE TAKEN DIVERGENT POSITIONS ON TAXES, SCHOOL 
FINANCE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As their contest for governor approaches a critical test in October, Democrat 
Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson have established sharply 
divergent positions on key issues like higher taxes, school finance and the 
environment -- defying the perception that there are no substantial differences 
between the two political moderates. 
</P>
<P>
California political analysts and commentators have repeatedly characterized 
the race as dull, contending that the candidates are ignoring the real issues 
and that Feinstein and Wilson seem more like philosophical soul mates. 
</P>
<P>
But during September, when their campaign often was overshadowed by the Middle 
East crisis, the candidates added considerable meat to their skeletal policy 
positions, either in speeches or in response to questions from reporters. The 
result has Wilson sounding more conservative and cautious, particularly on 
money issues. Feinstein is more willing to talk about the need for expanded 
state programs and new state revenues to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing state fiscal crisis -- with the potential for additional taxes 
simply to support existing programs -- has emerged as a defining issue that 
could dominate the candidates' televised debates on Oct. 7 and Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the temporary balancing gimmicks used to stitch together the 
long-delayed state spending plan, the new governor is likely to face a 
multibillion-dollar deficit in drafting his or her first state budget. 
</P>
<P>
If California still needs more revenue after making whatever budget cuts she 
could, Feinstein said, she would raise the income tax rate for the most wealthy 
Californians, couples making $200,000 or more annually. The top rate was 
reduced in 1987 from 11% to 9.3%. Feinstein also has endorsed Proposition 133, 
which would raise the sales tax by half a cent to pay for anti-drug and crime 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, by contrast, has said it would be foolish to rule out the need for new 
taxes, and has refused to do so, but he has said he would oppose any increase 
in personal income tax rates. This week, he strongly endorsed Proposition 136, 
which would require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature or the electorate to 
increase any state or local tax. 
</P>
<P>
But while he declined to endorse Proposition 133, the sales tax increase, he 
said he might vote for it. On Thursday, Wilson said that if Proposition 133 
loses, he would be willing to consider an effort in the Legislature to raise 
the sales tax half a cent for anti-drug and crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates also differ on budget reform, school finance and Proposition 98, 
the 1988 initiative measure that guarantees public schools at least 41% of the 
state's general fund revenues each year. That amounts to about $17 billion this 
year out of a total budget of $55.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, with the support of state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and 
the California Teachers Assn., has declared Proposition 98's guarantee 
"inviolate" and vowed to oppose any effort to change it. She favors budget 
reform that would reduce the level of spending required for some programs by 
state law or the state Constitution, but would not cut back on most major 
health and welfare programs, which account for nearly a third of the general 
fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also wants budget reform, but insists that all state spending items, 
including Proposition 98, be on the table for negotiated changes. The only 
exception is that Wilson would oppose any cuts in the state's supplemental 
Social Security payments for the aged, blind and disabled -- a program that 
costs $2.3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates are considered strong environmentalists, but again there is a 
key difference. Feinstein is endorsing Proposition 128, the far-reaching 
Environmental Protection Act of 1990 dubbed Big Green by its supporters. Wilson 
opposes the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
Both Feinstein and Wilson also promise to be activist governors who will attack 
problems such as California's unbridled growth. 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein promises the more aggressive effort, describing her approach as a 
"new awakening" fueled by "the politics of optimism and rebirth." Appearing at 
an Orange County Democratic meeting in Anaheim earlier this month, she talked 
of running a "creative administration" like that of Edmund G. (Pat) Brown in 
the 1960s "that built the best university system and built the California Water 
Project." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be the governor that says, 'Wake up, California. Let's move this 
state into a problem-solving mode, let's develop that water policy, let's solve 
the problems of the environment, let's manage our growth. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
Wilson vows to be the real candidate of change but his efforts could be 
hampered by his anti-tax stance and conflict with the Legislature's Democratic 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a struggle for the candidates to get their messages across in a 
period when Saddam Hussein and his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait continue to 
dominate the news. Feinstein has been dogged by questions about the business 
dealings of her financier-spouse, Richard Blum, who joined with Feinstein in 
lending her campaign $3 million for her primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Day marked a major turning point, leaving behind a desultory summer of 
exchanges of costly television commercials in which the candidates tried to 
taint each other with allegations related to the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The policy differences between them were accentuated by Feinstein during 
September as she ventured into the risky world of taxation, pledging support 
for billions of dollars for existing state programs and campaigning for 
stronger environmental regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The July-August television campaign seemed to result in a standoff. Going into 
September, the major public opinion polls indicated that the ad campaign had 
little effect. The two candidates were considered to be running about even, 
just as they were after the June 5 primary. October and its two scheduled 
debates provide Feinstein and Wilson the opportunity to capture the undecided 
swing voter. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a large number of people who sort of see Dianne in a positive 
context, but they have been comfortable with Wilson the way people are 
comfortable with an old pair of shoes," said Bill Carrick, Feinstein's campaign 
director. "Those people, in my view, have been postponing their decision until 
they get some point of comparison that is beyond the 30-second commercial." 
</P>
<P>
Some political experts have said that Feinstein has to make some sort of 
breakthrough to capture voter imagination and defeat Wilson -- something akin 
to the dramatic television commercial that propelled the Feinstein image into 
the public consciousness in her primary campaign. The ad showed Feinstein 
firmly taking control of San Francisco as acting mayor after the shooting death 
of Mayor George Moscone. The commercial has not been rerun since the June 5 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Both campaigns say they want to continue discussing issues during October 
rather than getting into another television commercial shoot-out. Wilson's 
theme, campaign director Otto Bos said, will be: "It's performance that counts, 
not promises." 
</P>
<P>
With 23 years of experience in the Legislature, as mayor of San Diego and U.S. 
senator, Wilson has a broader record of which to boast. Feinstein held public 
office for nearly 20 years, but entirely at the city and county level in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick said Feinstein intends to continue to emphasize issues and the 
intangible values of leadership, believing that voters are getting turned off 
by an "electric Ping-Pong" exchange of personal and negative television ads. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been specific on issues," he said. But he also noted that Wilson "has 
beaten up on us on taxes." The senator constantly reminds voters that he 
actually cut some taxes as mayor of San Diego while Feinstein raised levies in 
San Francisco.

SHIELD LAW PROTECTION UPHELD IN CIVIL SUITS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: STATE JUSTICES RULE UNANIMOUSLY THAT JOURNALISTS MAY NOT BE JAILED FOR 
REFUSING TO SURRENDER THEIR NOTES, PHOTOS AND OTHER UNPUBLISHED MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a victory for news organizations, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday 
that journalists may not be jailed for refusing to surrender notes, photos and 
other unpublished data for use in civil suits arising from events they cover. 
</P>
<P>
The court held unanimously that reporters are immune from being held in 
contempt for such refusals under California's news shield law. The law, placed 
in the state Constitution in 1980, allows journalists to withhold confidential 
sources or "any unpublished information" obtained while gathering news. 
</P>
<P>
The justices held last May that the shield law must give way, however, when a 
criminal defendant needs the disputed evidence to ensure a fair trial. But in 
Thursday's decision, the court, in an opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, 
said there was no comparable right in a civil case. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was welcomed as a "big jump" in press protections by C. Michael 
Cooley, attorney for the New York Times Co., owner of the Santa Barbara 
News-Press, whose photographer had refused requests to turn over unpublished 
accident photos to an automobile manufacturer being sued in a personal injury 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision underscores the will of the people back in 1980 to give broad 
protection to the press to gather news without concern that reporters will be 
repeatedly subject to civil subpoenas," Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. Zuk of Los Angeles, attorney for Volkswagen of America Inc., the 
defendant in the injury suit, said the ruling would unfairly impede plaintiffs 
and defendants from obtaining important evidence in civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
"This prevents civil litigants from even getting into the arena where their 
needs can be weighed against the interests of journalists," Zuk said. "It's a 
very unfortunate decision." 
</P>
<P>
The case arose after News-Press photographer Robert Ponce took several photos 
of an auto accident on U.S. 101 in 1984. Two of the photographs were published 
in the newspaper. A passenger in a Volkswagen van, Jerome Sortomme, was injured 
and he and his wife sued the auto maker. Volkswagen sought the unpublished 
photos to aid in its defense and, after the paper refused, went to court. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Patrick L. McMahon ordered the News-Press to 
produce the photos so he could inspect them to see if the paper's need for 
protection was outweighed by the company's need for evidence. The paper 
appealed, citing concerns that news gathering would be hampered by repeated 
demands for unpublished data. In June, 1988, a state Court of Appeal in Fresno 
reversed the order, holding that the shield law provided "absolute protection" 
to journalists who are not themselves parties in a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's decision, the high court upheld the appellate court and 
reaffirmed the shield law's guarantees. The court did note that other state 
laws could allow a reporter to be fined $500 and held liable for damages in 
some instances for refusing to turn over unpublished material to civil 
litigants. 
</P>
<P>
But as a practical matter, such monetary sanctions are not worth the cost to 
the litigants who seek them and thus are "virtually ineffectual," Eagleson 
wrote. "The simple economics of modern litigation essentially preclude such an 
action." 
</P>
<P>
In another ruling, the high court upheld the conviction and death sentence of 
Ronald Lee Sanders for the 1981 bludgeon murder of Janice Allen of Bakersfield. 
Sanders, now 38, was accused of killing the woman to prevent her from 
testifying against him in a previous attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-2 decision, the court rejected Sanders' claim that he was entitled to a 
retrial because Latinos were systematically under-represented in the pool of 
prospective jurors. Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard both 
dissented.

Debate prep: The previously announced statewide broadcast debate between 
candidates for governor Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson may be just that -- 
broadcast statewide. The California Broadcasters Assn., which is sponsoring the 
Oct. 7 event, has lined up 27 television stations and 20 radio outlets to carry 
the proceedings. All but eight plan to air the debate live. Locally, the debate 
will be seen at 6 p.m. on KNBC-TV, where it is being held. It also can be seen 
on KMEX-TV and KVEA-TV, which is sponsoring a simultaneous Spanish translation. 
"There will be at least one television and radio station in every market from 
Eureka to El Centro," said Vic Biondi, the association's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Vote talk: Although they drone on for a mind-numbing six hours, Secretary of 
State March Fong Eu has already run out of audio cassettes of the state ballot 
pamphlet. Eu, who is seeking financial help to buy more tapes, said 1,000 
cassettes were snapped up by commuters and others who would rather not read the 
143-page pamphlet. It is unclear whether this challenges the notion of an 
apathetic electorate or is simply a commentary on the quality of radio 
programming.

Ollie power: Former White House aide Oliver L. North still has the kind of 
political star power sought by some of the state's conservative legislators. In 
his first California campaign swing of 1990, North will appear with Republican 
legislators at political events all over the state in a two-day swing beginning 
today. Assemblyman Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach was the first to ask North to 
attend a fund-raiser for him but denied he needs the mediagenic former Colonel 
to shore up his conservative credentials. "I'm one guy he's not to the right 
of," Ferguson said.

Promising New Yorkers cleaner air, state officials Thursday adopted the tough 
California motor vehicle emissions standard for cars sold in New York after 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, New York became the second state in the nation to adopt standards 
higher than those imposed by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey and Massachusetts are expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
California is considering even tougher regulations that would require cleaner 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The New York emission standards are identical to California standards that have 
been in effect for several years. Today, California officials are expected to 
adopt stricter standards that will require at least 10% of cars sold in 
California in the year 2003 to emit no pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The auto industry opposed the stricter New York standards as too expensive and 
not relevant to the Northeast, where they say a colder climate does not produce 
the same levels of ozone as in California. 
</P>
<P>
But state Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas Jorling said the cost 
of the new emissions standards should be no more than $100.

PAPER INDUSTRY DISPUTES U.S. DATA ON DIOXIN

Paper companies on Thursday strongly disputed EPA findings that their mills are 
contaminating fish with hazardous dioxin at levels posing a serious health risk 
to local fishermen who eat their catch. 
</P>
<P>
Industry spokesmen charged that the Environmental Protection Agency relied on 
outdated information in assessing the health risk from dioxin residues that are 
released into streams from bleaching processes used to make white paper 
products. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, they said the agency had relied on fish tissue samples taken in 
1988 that did not reflect recent improvements in the bleaching process that the 
companies say have greatly reduced dioxin discharges. 
</P>
<P>
"The EPA ignored more recent data that calls into serious question the basis of 
their risk assessments," said Richard Phillips, vice president and director of 
process technology for the International Paper Co., whose Georgetown, S.C., 
plant was cited as posing the highest dioxin risks of any U.S. paper mill. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said people eating two quarter-pound meals a month of fish caught 
downstream from the Georgetown plant faced a lifetime cancer risk of 1 in 100. 
The agency said sport or subsistence fishermen who eat larger amounts were 
exposed to a cancer risk of 1 in 10. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the EPA said 20 paper mills nationwide expose local fishermen to a 
lifetime cancer risk greater than 1 in 10,000. In contrast, the EPA considers a 
cancer risk of 1 in a million a permissible level of dioxin risk. 
</P>
<P>
The industry already has pledged cooperation with EPA efforts to reduce dioxin 
discharges by improving its bleaching process. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said International Paper offered EPA data on fish contamination levels 
compiled by South Carolina officials in April, 1990, but the EPA refused to 
accept the new information.

Britain and Iran announced Thursday that they have resumed diplomatic 
relations, which were severed by Iran in March, 1989, in a dispute over a 
controversial novel. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, and 
Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister. Both are in New York for the 
opening of the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"Effective today," Hurd told reporters, "the United Kingdom and Iran have 
resumed diplomatic relations on the basis of mutual respect and will reopen 
their embassies in London and Tehran within one month." 
</P>
<P>
Hurd made no mention of the novel, Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," which 
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini denounced as blasphemous. Khomeini called 
for the assassination of Rushdie, an Indian-born Briton, and when Britain 
refused to ban the book and condemn its author, the Iranian government broke 
off relations. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd evaded reporters' questions about Rushdie, who has spent the past 18 
months in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our understanding from public statements made by Iranian officials that 
the Iranian government respects the law and would not interfere in the internal 
affairs of any other country, any more than the United Kingdom would," Hurd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This was interpreted as assurance that Rushdie is now safe from Iranian 
assassins. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Velayati referred to the dispute only indirectly and refused 
to answer questions about Rushdie. He said that after relations between the two 
governments were severed, the Iranian Parliament forbade a resumption until 
Britain agreed to respect Iran's position in the Rushdie case. 
</P>
<P>
He said Hurd had written a letter pledging his government's "respect for Islam 
and Islamic values" and that this had enabled Iran's National Security Council 
to confirm that "all conditions have been met" for relations to be resumed. 
</P>
<P>
A British diplomat, speaking on condition that he not be identified by name, 
said the British government continues to support Rushdie's right to freedom of 
expression and to reject the Iranian death sentence for Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is better to discuss our differences in this case through normal 
diplomatic channels rather than elsewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd praised Iran for voting, in the U.N. Security Council, to support an 
embargo on trade with Iraq. He said there are other issues outstanding between 
London and Tehran and that they should be discussed at the diplomatic level. 
Specifically, he mentioned the British hostages held in Lebanon by Islamic 
followers of the Iranian revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement raised mild hopes in London that there might now be some 
movement toward freeing the hostages, among them Terry Waite, an envoy of the 
Archbishop of Canterbury who was abducted while trying to arrange the release 
of other hostages. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said it would have no comment on the 
announcement. Spokesman Richard Boucher said, "That's between them." 
</P>
<P>
Neither London nor Tehran acknowledged that it has made any concessions in 
agreeing to restore diplomatic relations, which both wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranians wanted ties with Britain as part of a broader effort to improve 
its relations with Western governments. The British saw in resumed relations 
not only a means of dealing with the hostage situation but also an improved 
position in a region changing as a result of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last 
month.

Ahmed Ben Bella, Algeria's independence leader and first president, ended a 
decade of exile Thursday, demanding the ouster of the Algerian government and 
urging followers to fight on behalf of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Algerians lined the waterfront to greet him after an 
overnight ferry voyage from Spain. Posters of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 
fluttered alongside portraits of Ben Bella. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq needs support," Ben Bella, 73, said in an hourlong speech after coming 
ashore. "Telephone the Iraqis, send telegrams and tell them you are with them. 
Go by the hundreds of thousands to the Iraqi Embassy and don't leave until they 
sign you up as volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Bella, who recently flew to Iraq for talks with Hussein, urged supporters 
to stage a protest at the U.S. Embassy denouncing the American military 
deployment in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ben Bella's first time back in Algeria since he voluntarily went into 
exile in Europe in 1981 after serving 15 years in prison. He became Algeria's 
first president in 1962 after an eight-year independence war against France but 
was overthrown and imprisoned during a 1965 coup led by Col. Houari 
Boumedienne, the army chief. 
</P>
<P>
A throng of people massed along a seaside boulevard, chanting Ben Bella's name, 
as the car ferry Hoggar arrived from Barcelona. Other boats in the harbor 
blared horns and sirens in welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Bella said he hopes to forge a new political coalition to defeat the 
long-ruling National Liberation Front, to which he once belonged. Legislative 
elections are scheduled by the end of March, but Ben Bella said the government 
should resign immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has no more credibility and thus cannot prepare for the next 
elections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his rambling address in French and Arabic, Ben Bella hailed radical Arab 
leaders and their causes. 
</P>
<P>
"Long live Palestine!" he cried. "Long live Iraq! Long live Saddam! Long live 
Libya! Long live Moammar Kadafi!" 
</P>
<P>
Ben Bella returns home as Islamic fundamentalists stand poised to win 
legislative elections in six months. With or without them, Ben Bella hopes to 
forge an alliance of opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
The former president had disappointed partisans by not returning for local and 
regional elections June 12, Algeria's first multiparty balloting since 1962. He 
had urged a boycott of those elections, claiming they would be rigged by the 
ruling National Liberation Front.

KAIFU OUTLINES PLAN FOR JAPANESE PERSONNEL IN GULF

Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu outlined draft legislation Thursday for a U.N. 
Peace Cooperation Corps that, if approved by Parliament, could provide a 
structure for sending Japanese military personnel to the Persian Gulf or to 
other international trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
The measure provides that any troops used in this way would remove their 
military uniforms and assume noncombat duties under civilian control. 
</P>
<P>
They probably would not carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu did not say exactly how large he expects the contingent to be, nor did he 
spell out any specific assignments they might perform. He emphasized, however, 
that Japan's first foreign military deployment since World War II would be in 
keeping with its postwar peace constitution, which renounces the sovereign 
right to wage war. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan will never again become a military power," Kaifu told a televised news 
conference. Kaifu was to leave today for New York to attend the U.N. World 
Summit for Children and meet with President Bush. Afterward he will make a 
five-nation tour of the Middle East to explain a package of $2 billion in 
economic aid for affected allied nations in the region and $2 billion in 
support for the multinational force.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Joseph C. Wilson IV, the United States' acting ambassador to Iraq, met 
with reporters Thursday to answer what Washington has called Iraq's latest 
threat to Westerners in Baghdad, he dressed to make a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Tied tightly around his neck and hand-fashioned from a length of clothesline 
was a noose that Wilson wore with his green pin-striped shirt -- his answer, he 
said, to a diplomatic note this week from Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command 
Council that implied that diplomats harboring other foreigners would be subject 
to execution. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's garb was hardly an attempt at gallows humor: Later, he said the noose 
was meant as a clear symbol of America's "utter disdain" for the Iraqi note, 
which Hussein's government Thursday flatly denied was meant to threaten Western 
diplomats. U.S. diplomatic sites scattered across Baghdad have been giving 
haven to about two dozen Americans seeking refuge from Hussein's "human shield" 
of hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The wearing of the noose is another high-profile move by Washington and its 
allies to fuel the image of Hussein and his leadership as villains. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the diplomatic note, which directed embassies to supply the 
names of foreigners housed in their compounds, Iraqi Information Minister Latif 
Jasim on Thursday reflected Baghdad's confusion over an angry response by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and others. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, this is just a misunderstanding," Jasim told American journalists, 
adding that a second note had been sent to all embassies. "It is a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "In each crisis, some tension crops up, and sometimes such tension is 
exploited. We just wanted foreigners' names to be put on a list so that we will 
be legally responsible for them." 
</P>
<P>
The original note, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, was dated Sept. 
19 and received by all embassies days before Washington condemned it publicly. 
Indeed, Britain, which is housing a number of non-diplomatic citizens in a tent 
city at its embassy compound, received the note Monday. But there was no 
reaction from London until Thursday, when the Foreign Office followed Baker's 
lead in declaring, "Iraq's threat makes it quite impossible to take seriously 
its pretentions to be a civilized state." 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" one Western diplomat said with a shrug when asked about the 
delayed reaction. "Why not take advantage of a slow news week?" 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat who has been in Baghdad for more than a year added that Iraq's 
official wording in the note was consistent with what they had grown accustomed 
to even before the crisis began last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Europeans around here take the view that it was tactlessly drafted, but 
you get used to such things in Iraq," he said. "We interpreted this as 
ham-handed but largely benign bureaucracy -- merely a firm reminder that, under 
Iraqi law, all foreigners in Iraq should simply register (with the 
government)." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, senior Western embassy analysts in Baghdad said they originally 
interpreted the two-paragraph note as an encouraging sign from the Iraqi 
leadership, although the actual text can be seen as an implied threat to 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
The note begins by restating an Iraqi policy announced more than a month ago 
"that housing a foreigner for the purpose of hiding him or her from the 
authorities is a crime of espionage" punishable by death. It says nothing 
specifically about diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Then the note declares that the Iraqi Foreign Ministry "will appreciate it if 
the esteemed mission would kindly inform the ministry of whether any of its 
citizens or any other nation's citizens are residing in the missions, embassies 
or diplomatic residences, whether or not these citizens have contracts with the 
government or are working with foreign companies operating in Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
"In the Iraqi context," said one European diplomat, "it all sounded like a 
benign and bureaucratic request at the time. Some missions even thought it 
implied the Iraqis were considering giving these people exit visas to get out 
of here. Most of us were quite surprised when we awoke this morning to hear Mr. 
Baker's reaction. But strange things happen when you're on the brink of war." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another example of diplomatic confusion emerged out of a 14-word 
phrase that was deleted, apparently inadvertently, from Hussein's latest angry 
speech, delivered Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The speech -- interpreted as a threat to destroy Persian Gulf oil fields if 
international sanctions begin to "strangle" Iraq -- was widely viewed in the 
West as an Iraqi escalation toward war. Analysts in Baghdad say it drove up the 
price of oil by at least $8 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
But what Hussein actually said in the speech, read out for him in Arabic by a 
television news reader without English subtitles, was, "If we feel that the 
people of Iraq are being strangled and that there are some who are directing a 
bloody strike at the Iraqis, (italics added) we will strangle all those who are 
the cause of such a state of affairs." This, he indicated, would include 
bombing "the land of oil in Saudi Arabia and in other states of the region." 
</P>
<P>
The italicized phrase was not included in the translation that reached the news 
media that night. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when asked by Western journalists about the interpretation that 
Hussein was deliberately escalating the war of words, Naji Hadithi, a top media 
adviser to the Iraqi government, handed out the official translation of the 
speech, which independent interpreters confirmed did indeed agree with 
Hussein's original. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Western diplomat, whose nation is participating in the multinational 
force in Saudi Arabia, said that even the fiery pronouncements of Hussein and 
his top advisers that have been accurately translated are often misunderstood 
by the West. 
</P>
<P>
"By the standards of Arab leaders, none of this stuff has been extreme at all," 
said the diplomat, who speaks Arabic. "This rhetoric is an indication that 
(Hussein) has gotten the message. In the Arab context, they're the sorts of 
things you say when your back is up against the wall."

SOVIET LAWMAKERS FACE TEST OF DEMOCRACY -- AND DUCK; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: DEPUTIES, UNABLE TO DECIDE ON AN ECONOMIC COURSE, PASS THE ISSUE TO 
GORBACHEV.

<P>
Soviet democracy, so young and fragile, was facing its biggest challenge this 
week -- restructuring the country's entire economic system -- and the nation's 
lawmakers reverted quickly to political tradition by yielding to the leadership 
most of their powers to decide and act. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, was asked to choose between two 
reform programs, one that aims at developing a market economy in the next year 
and a half, replacing the failed system of state socialism, and the other that 
foresees a far more gradual transition. 
</P>
<P>
More was at stake, however, than the tempo of reform, for the two programs are 
based on entirely different political philosophies. The gradual approach 
largely seeks to preserve socialism and the radical stance abandons that 
ideology entirely. 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviet Union, forged by the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and seven decades 
of Communist leadership, the choice would be historic and fateful, reshaping 
one of the world's great powers as it moves into the 21st Century. Only rarely 
is such a momentous question posed so directly to a parliament. 
</P>
<P>
It was a decision toward which perestroika, the five years of political and 
economic reforms under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had been aimed, one that 
could determine the success or failure of those reforms and one that would 
project the authority of the Supreme Soviet as an institution of the new 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
It was also an issue that the people's deputies, as the lawmakers are known, 
had debated frequently in the 16 months since the Supreme Soviet was 
reconstituted on the basis of the country's first free elections in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
But the deputies were not ready. Study, they did; debate, they did, but decide, 
they could not. In the end, they delegated their legislative powers to 
Gorbachev, enabling him to rule the country by decree in order to promote the 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet's inability to decide such a crucial issue dismayed many, 
and it has now raised serious questions about the future of democracy here. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies did approve the radical reform program "in principle" on Monday, 
but they asked Gorbachev to combine it with the rival program and modify the 
result according to comments and criticism received from around the country. 
They will review this "unified program" in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators then authorized Gorbachev to take almost any actions he thinks 
necessary to carry out the reforms, subject only to a possible veto by the 
Supreme Soviet. His extraordinary powers will run until March 31, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies, while committing the nation to reforms meant to democratize and 
decentralize, have reverted to the old system of top-down commands; after 
assuming decision-making authority from the Communist Party, they handed it 
over to the president, who himself appeared paralyzed with indecision. 
</P>
<P>
They also weakened their own institution by avoiding what was clearly a hard 
decision for many of the 522 active deputies, but a decision that would have 
clearly established the political authority of the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
And, by wavering on the scope and speed of the reform program, they failed to 
end the crisis of confidence that many Soviet political commentators see as 
threatening to turn the country's political and economic problems into chaos, 
anarchy and even civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"The deputies displayed a shocking incompetence and unwillingness to assume 
responsibility," Nikolai Y. Petrakov, Gorbachev's economic adviser, said, 
describing the decisions as a "defeat" for the Supreme Soviet as the nation's 
legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
"The deputies should be the most in tune with the people, and yet here the 
president had to set the pace and take all the responsibility onto his 
shoulders. This was not his desire, but the nation could not wait." 
</P>
<P>
A legal commentator for Komsomolskaya Pravda, one of the most widely read 
newspapers, called the action "a virtual freeze in the development of the 
law-governed state" and "a step back from the separation of powers toward their 
concentration in the person of the president." 
</P>
<P>
Other commentators, who had written of the nation's "hour of choice," lamented 
that the deputies had avoided making a choice themselves. 
</P>
<P>
And radicals in the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, many of whom voted 
against granting Gorbachev the extraordinary powers or abstained on the 
measure, caucused Wednesday to express their dissatisfaction with the 
legislature's failure to act decisively itself on the economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"A failure of political will," one commented. Another called it "a shameful 
abdication of power." 
</P>
<P>
But Yuri V. Golik, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's committee on legislation, 
defended the moves as necessary so Gorbachev could act immediately to stabilize 
the political and economic situation. He compared the authority given Gorbachev 
to the emergency powers that Congress granted President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
during the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Soviet should exercise control over what the president does," 
Golik said. "Much still depends on the Supreme Soviet." 
</P>
<P>
Other crucial issues lie ahead. Gorbachev will submit the "unified" program in 
two weeks, and the deputies may be asked for their endorsement. The Soviet 
Union's future as a federal system is under discussion after the declarations 
of "sovereignty" by virtually all 15 constituent republics. Other far-reaching 
legislation is pending. 
</P>
<P>
There are now serious doubts, however, about the ability of the Supreme Soviet 
or its parent body -- the Congress of People's Deputies, which as the national 
parliament has ultimate authority -- to deal with fundamental or complex 
issues. There is even discussion in the press about whether they should be 
dissolved and new elections held, or simply disbanded as failures. 
</P>
<P>
Many radicals, paradoxically, appear as ready to accept strong presidential 
rule as do conservatives, seeing in Gorbachev a surer and faster means of 
achieving fundamental reforms. While committed to democracy, they have grown 
increasingly fearful that perestroika has lost all its momentum and has 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the worried discussion in recent months about whether the armed forces are 
planning a coup, perhaps in conjunction with elements of the Communist Party's 
leadership, some liberal commentators have argued that Gorbachev might do well 
to use the military in this way to establish a market economy, since soldiers 
would follow orders where bureaucrats have not, and they would impose order 
where chaos looms. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislav S. Shatalin, the principal author of the radical economic reform 
program, acknowledged the legislators' actions as "a failure for democracy," 
but he attributed it largely to the sheer youth of the Supreme Soviet as an 
institution and the inexperience of its members and called for patience. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine yourself a deputy, and you will see you are living in a system that 
has nothing to do with the tasks before you," he said in an interview 
Wednesday. "Yet, you have to be ready to make decisions on a new system that 
you do not know or understand. . . . Everyone of us is still learning. . . ."

Police defused a suspected IRA bomb Thursday at a conference on terrorism due 
to be addressed by British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave and 
London Police Chief Peter Imbert. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. 
</P>
<P>
George Churchill-Coleman, head of Britain's anti-terrorist police squad, said 
he believes that the bomb was planted by the Irish Republican Army just hours 
before the international meeting was due to begin. 
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference that the bomb, planted in a lunch box under the 
speaker's lectern, contained "sufficient high explosive that, had the device 
exploded . . . it would of course have caused death and serious injury." 
</P>
<P>
Churchill-Coleman said he did not believe that Waldegrave or Imbert were 
specific targets of the bomb, made of plastic explosive. "The target of the 
device was the conference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the bomb was discovered as delegates began arriving at the Royal 
Overseas League, the conference's central London site, for the opening session 
of the one-day conference on terrorism.

GERMANYS' SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTIES FORMALLY MERGED

Less than one week before German unification, the East and West German Social 
Democratic parties merged into a single organization and pledged to help the 
new Germany "find its place in a peaceful Europe." 
</P>
<P>
When the two countries unite next Wednesday, the Social Democratic Party, or 
SPD, will be the largest opposition group to the conservative-led government of 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in December elections. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of more than 550 delegates at the SPD's reunification congress voted 
against the new party's rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Together we start work, so that for the first time in history Germany can find 
its place in a peaceful Europe," the party said in its new manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither national self-contentment nor even nationalistic exuberance are needed 
now, but rather solidarity of Germans among themselves," the statement said. 
"What is also needed is solidarity with the peoples of Central and Eastern 
Europe who are treading a new path, and with the majority of mankind, which is 
faced with bitter poverty," 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt told the delegates 
that "Germany . . . needs social democracy."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merchants and restaurateurs shuttered thousands of state-owned shops across the 
country Thursday to protest government plans to auction off their workplaces to 
private owners. 
</P>
<P>
The labor action demanding that workers be given preferential conditions to buy 
into their own firms threatens to escalate and signals a souring of the public 
mood toward the new democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
It also illustrates the difficulty that workers in the former Communist nations 
have in coping with some unfamiliar, and what they see as unfair, demands of 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament has not yet endorsed details of the government plan to privatize 
70,000 small businesses beginning this fall. But a published draft of the 
government proposal has angered employees of retail and service shops who fear 
for their jobs and their chances of participating in Czechoslovakia's 
transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
To protest the competitive bidding that the state intends to use to extract 
itself from the service industry, Czechoslovak waiters and hairdressers, shoe 
repairers and kiosk clerks posted strike signs at 3 p.m. and turned away 
customers for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want auctions, because then we could be bought out by the local Mafia 
-- the former Communist Party officials and money changers and others who have 
benefited from corruption," protested Jaroslav Novy, manager of the 
Staromestska Restaurant named for the cobblestone square in central Prague 
where it stands. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too much uncertainty about the future in the country now," Novy 
lamented, huddled with fellow strikers in a room off the cluttered kitchen he 
oversees. "I understand that the government is under pressure to do something, 
but this is not the way it should proceed." 
</P>
<P>
The strikers said they want the state to set a price for each enterprise so 
workers can pool their funds to form ownership cooperatives. They also objected 
to a proposed requirement that a 50% down payment on each business be made in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here for 21 years, starting out as the lowliest waiter," said Jiri 
Svoboda, manager of the Green Frog Restaurant tucked into the executioner's 
quarters of a 17th-Century palace. "I should be allowed to own part of this 
restaurant, but I've raised four children and have no money." 
</P>
<P>
The labor unrest began Wednesday with a symbolic one-hour closure, which was 
expanded to three hours Thursday to step up the pressure. Czechoslovak Radio 
said 1,750 shops were shut down in northern Moravia, and that the strike 
appeared to have been broadly observed across the rest of the country as well. 
The national Confederation of Trade Unions, which had encouraged only a 
five-minute warning strike, said the protest action threatened to get out of 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's strikes were the most extensive labor unrest to hit Czechoslovakia 
since its peaceful revolt against communism last November. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the government is talking more to economists than with the 
people like us who want to own businesses," said Marian Sykora, a food-service 
worker at the Prince Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
President Vaclav Havel met with federal and republic government leaders to 
discuss the public backlash but emerged from the daylong talks to confirm that 
the leadership won't artificially manipulate conditions for the selloff to 
favor employees. 
</P>
<P>
He told Czechoslovak television after the meeting that special bank loans will 
be made available to groups of employees to finance up to half of the cost of 
their enterprises. But the 50% down-payment requirement could exclude many 
ordinary workers who have little or no savings on which to draw.

BILL WOULD OUTLAW GOP'S DONOR CHECK-OFF TACTIC

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.) of the House Banking Committee introduced 
legislation Thursday designed to outlaw a Republican fund-raising tactic he 
says is deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent $25 checks 
to a million prospective contributors. Fine print on the back of the checks, if 
they are endorsed, authorizes the GOP committee to deduct $12.50 a month from 
recipients' checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Vento's act would amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to ensure that the 
endorsement, cashing or deposit of a check cannot be used to authorize 
automatic withdrawals from a checking account. 
</P>
<P>
"If left unchecked this new bait-and-hook gimmick will become the scam artist 
dream of the '90s," Vento said. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic attorneys general in Alabama and Illinois have filed suit to stop 
the Republican committee's solicitation. Republican attorneys general in 
Wisconsin and Oregon and the Democratic attorney general in Minnesota have said 
they were investigating the tactic. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Burnley, a spokeswoman for the Republican committee, said the 
fund-raising letter accompanying the checks clearly explained that endorsing 
them would authorize automatic withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
She said that only the first two withdrawals were mandatory, that further 
withdrawals could be stopped and that a full refund could be obtained by 
calling a toll-free number provided in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
However, some recipients have complained that they did not realize that they 
were authorizing deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Burnley said the Republican committee has agreed to meet with state officials 
objecting to the solicitations, after the election. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Democrats asked the Federal Election Commission on Thursday to halt 
a Republican fund-raising scheme they said could illegally raise millions of 
dollars for GOP Senate candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee asked the commission to stop the 
Republican Senatorial Inner Circle, which already has disbursed about $1 
million to dozens of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans defend the Inner Circle as a legitimate joint fund-raising 
operation exempt from contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law allows party committees to give candidates $17,500 and spend an 
additional amount on their behalf according to individual state populations. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge last year ruled in a lawsuit filed by Common Cause that the 
National Republican Senatorial Committee illegally funneled $2.7 million in 
individual contributions to a dozen 1986 Senate candidates through a maneuver 
known as "bundling." 
</P>
<P>
The differences between the 1986 and 1990 operations "are no more than 
cosmetic," the Democrats said.

Comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who went to federal court seeking some respect and 
$5 million after his eyes were burned in a steam bath accident at Caesars 
Palace, was awarded $725,000 by a jury Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated less than a day before returning with a verdict awarding the 
comic $225,000 for performances he missed in March, 1988, and another $500,000 
for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
The jury ruled that Caesars was obligated under the contract to pay Dangerfield 
for the missed shows because the injury should have excused him from 
performing. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also ruled against the resort in its $100,000 countersuit against its 
former headliner. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth won out," said Dangerfield, 68, who arrived at U.S. District Court 
after the verdict was announced. He criticized Caesars for filing papers in 
court before the trial accusing him of drug use and called the accusations 
"nonsense and untrue." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed," said Bruce Aguilera, Caesars Palace counsel. "We'll 
have to have our lawyers look at the case. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerfield had asked for $5 million in damages plus $45,000 for each of the 
five shows he missed the week of the accident, claiming that Caesars was 
negligent in installing and maintaining a steam bath he used immediately after 
each of his performances at the posh resort. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, in its countersuit, claimed that Dangerfield breached his contract 
by not performing shows as scheduled and contended during the 2 1/2-week-long 
trial that the comedian showed no signs of permanent injury from the accident.

Words on the airwaves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That they can be weapons has been demonstrated by the scorching battle of 
euphemism and hyperbole that has marked Persian Gulf tensions and blurred 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Propagandizing words are hardly new to TV. They're the very essence of the 
medium, in fact, from their use in toothpaste commercials to the infinite book 
and movie promotions passed off as useful conversation on talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
Such words are stored in our brains as symbolic forms that can be recalled with 
the proper stimuli. After years of seeing and hearing Arab and terrorist 
linked, for example, exposure to one of these words automatically triggers a 
mental image of the other, justified or not. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf conflict has intensified the spotlight on words, from Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein's self-serving description of his captives as "guests" -- as if 
he were Conrad Hilton and checkout time were noon -- to early characterizations 
of Hussein by President Bush and others as a "Hitler" or a "madman." Despite a 
recent softening on the verbal front in the United States, the "Hitler" and 
"madman" labels persist. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein is a rotten character, all right, but villains as epic as Hitler come 
along only about once a millennium. And for someone at times described as 
demented, he seems to have acted rather shrewdly at times. For instance, 
although his ruthless policy of deploying "human shields" at key installations 
sharpens his maniacal image in the West, for all we know it may indeed have 
achieved his purpose of deterring a U.S. air attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitler" and "madman" are dehumanizing words of warspeak that have traveled 
across the airwaves since early August -- effective language for shaping public 
opinion and whipping up fervor for troop buildups and military action. After 
all, if your opponent is as monstrous as Hitler -- whose holocaustic policies 
killed 13 million civilians -- or is incapable of rational thought on any 
level, then even the most extreme action against him seems not only justified, 
but even mandatory. You don't negotiate with a deranged demon. 
</P>
<P>
More gulf-coverage language to ponder: 
</P>
<P>
* Crisis. When does this cease being a "crisis"? Although that word continues 
to be the operative title in local coverage describing events in the gulf 
region, the networks have increasingly tried alternatives. ABC, for example, 
has been calling it the "gulf standoff." 
</P>
<P>
* Middle East situation desk. Sounds impressive, evoking a feeling of danger 
and excitement and images of huge maps and charts in front of which journalists 
who are specialists follow troop and diplomatic movements in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Actually, the "Middle East situation desk" is KABC radio's 
exaggerated description of its modest rip-and-read operation. When it comes to 
hyperbole, broadcasters take a back seat to no one. 
</P>
<P>
* Exclusive. More hyperbole. Never have there been more "exclusive" TV 
interviews with a single person than those with Mohamed Sadiq Al-Mashat, the 
Iraqi ambassador to the United States. This guy has to be wearing roller skates 
to get to all these "exclusive" interviews. The loose interpretation of 
"exclusive" here is that no one else was interviewing him at that moment. 
</P>
<P>
* Our boys overseas. This archaic description of U.S. forces in the gulf region 
should be dropped immediately in view of the numerous females serving abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The questionable use of certain words extends beyond the gulf story. For 
example: 
</P>
<P>
* Live. Perhaps the leading weapon in local news arsenals is the "live" report, 
even when going "live" serves no purpose other than to create a mood of 
excitement and immediacy that's intended to titillate viewers, not inform them. 
Having someone do a "live" standup on a day-old story is every bit as deceptive 
and manipulative as it is dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
* Special. NBC programs that look like documentaries, sound like documentaries 
and, in fact, are documentaries, are no no longer documentaries. So says the 
network. Its new title for such programs -- "special" -- is designed to attract 
viewers who normally would not view documentaries. And after viewing some of 
these programs, they may not want to view "specials" again, either. 
</P>
<P>
* Victim. Some of the publicity concerning "When You Remember Me," a movie 
airing Oct. 7 on ABC, describes Fred Savage as playing a "victim" of muscular 
dystrophy. Having a disability does not make one a "victim," a word that 
connotes helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
* They. You've heard it an infinite number of times: "They say." Yes, well, 
that takes care of that, for if "they" said it, it must be true. But who are 
the mysterious "they," and where do "they" get their information? Why do "they" 
know more than we know? 
</P>
<P>
* Brown nose and suck. It's startling how some words and expressions come into 
common usage on TV and elsewhere without anyone seeming to consider their 
genesis. To "brown nose" means to cozy up to someone you want to impress. It 
succeeds "apple polishing." But unlike the latter, "brown nosing" verbalizes a 
physical act -- the words are self-explanatory -- that is disgusting. 
</P>
<P>
"You suck!" were the words spoken by a 7-year-old character on the premiere of 
the new CBS series "Uncle Buck." CBS justified using the line on the basis that 
kids that age say it all the time. That's another debate. But even if they do 
say it, do they know that it refers to oral sex? 
</P>
<P>
* Destroy and put to sleep. These are the common euphemisms for taking the 
lives of animals, cushioning terms designed to make us feel better about the 
act. Humans are killed or murdered, animals are destroyed, a word that implies 
a certain detachment. Humans are killed, animals are put to sleep, as if 
they'll wake up later. 
</P>
<P>
A story on a recent local newscast detailed a number of animals in the 
possession of a man arrested at his house. One was a rattlesnake. Said the 
reporter: "Authorities put the snake to sleep." Did they sing it a lullaby or 
what? 
</P>
<P>
Some expressions should be "put to sleep."

A PHONE-Y STAN MUSIAL; 
</P>
<P>
41 YEARS AFTER HOAX, HE GETS TO MEET THE REAL STAN THE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It had been more than 41 years since the story based on my telephone interview 
with Stan (the Man) Musial had created a sensation in Biloxi, Miss., and 
created headlines nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last Wednesday, I was getting a chance to meet the great man in 
person. 
</P>
<P>
He showed up smiling for a meeting of the Stan Musial Society at the Capitol 
Hilton Hotel and even now was mobbed by fans young and old seeking autographs. 
Always the gentleman -- off and on the field -- he obligingly signed autographs 
for all of them, even though it made him 10 minutes late for the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Waving and still smiling, he strode through the crowd of about 150. He had been 
28 years old the year of my interview, an authentic superstar whose impeccable 
and unassuming character made him a national hero. Now he was 69, but the same 
trim 185 pounds that he weighed when he played his last game in 1963; he had 
gained only 10 pounds since starting his first game with the Cardinals in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
The Musial Society had given me the honor of introducing him, and I was sitting 
at the head table eagerly awaiting his arrival -- and the opportunity to tell 
the story behind the story, which neither Musial himself nor members of the 
audience had ever heard. 
</P>
<P>
To appreciate the thrill of my finally meeting Musial, you have to know the 
background of the interview I conducted on Feb. 8, 1949. I was all of 19 at the 
time, just starting out in journalism as a reporter in Biloxi for the Daily 
Herald -- predecessor of what today is the Biloxi Sun-Herald. 
</P>
<P>
I was at my desk in the Daily Herald's office when Cosman Eisendrath, the city 
editor, telephoned and asked if I knew of a Stan Musial from St. Louis. It's 
safe to say Mr. Eisendrath was not much of a sports fan. 
</P>
<P>
Did I know of a Stan Musial from St. Louis! Was he kidding? Of course I knew of 
the National League's Most Valuable Player of 1948, who hit 39 home runs that 
year and had a batting average of .376. He was right up there with Joe DiMaggio 
and Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Musial had checked into the Hotel Biloxi, Mr. Eisendrath said -- he was 
Mr. Eisendrath then, and remained Mr. Eisendrath to me for the rest of his 
life. And if Musial was that important, he suggested, perhaps I should get a 
quick interview with him on the telephone, because we were close to deadline. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, Biloxi was a popular resort town on the Gulf of Mexico, and the 
Hotel Biloxi was the Coast's favorite abode for visiting VIPs. I had covered 
such celebrities staying there as Gen. George Marshall and Bess and Margaret 
Truman. 
</P>
<P>
Musial was my idol, and I was excited about the opportunity to interview him. I 
telephoned the hotel, and the operator put me through immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello," I said, "this is Jack Nelson of the Daily Herald. Are you the Stan 
Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals?" 
</P>
<P>
The man who answered the phone said he was and agreed to an interview on the 
phone, though he said with characteristic politeness that it would have to be 
brief because he had another appointment. He was en route to St. Petersburg, 
Fla., where the Cardinals would soon begin spring training, he said, and had 
just stopped off in Biloxi for a rest. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Musial was known for his modest manner, and there was not a trace of 
bragging in the interview. Nonetheless, it made a terrific story. 
</P>
<P>
Under the headline, "MUSIAL TRAINS SIGHTS ON .400 MARK THIS SEASON," my story 
began: 
</P>
<P>
"Stan Musial, famous St. Louis Cardinal baseball player, enjoying a two-day 
rest at Hotel Biloxi, today said that he is 'shooting for the .400 batting mark 
this year.' " 
</P>
<P>
I went on to report that Musial "says he has been practicing batting on his 
ranch in Texas" and believes he will actually break the .400 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cardinal slugger also has high hopes of bettering his total of 39 home 
runs in 1948," I wrote, and quoted him from my notes as saying: "I believe the 
batting practice I had on my ranch near El Paso has helped my distance, too." 
</P>
<P>
The story went all over the country on the Associated Press wire, and I 
imagined that my interview was the talk of the baseball world. As a young 
reporter, I was in heaven -- until that night. 
</P>
<P>
That night I got a telephone call from Mr. Eisendrath. Unaccountably, he wanted 
to know if I was sure the man I interviewed actually was Stan Musial. What a 
crazy question! Of course, it was Stan Musial. Didn't he know all of Musial's 
season and lifetime statistics? Weren't all baseball players on their way to 
spring training in Florida? 
</P>
<P>
Why would Mr. Eisendrath even ask such a question? 
</P>
<P>
He said someone with AP in New Orleans had read my story and raised a question 
about whether Stan Musial had a ranch in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"AP, they think they know everything," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what should I tell them?" Mr. Eisendrath said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell 'em it's Stan Musial," I said. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, I got another call from Mr. Eisendrath. The AP had checked 
with the Cardinals' headquarters in St. Louis and learned that Musial was in 
Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, I went down to the Biloxi police station and told Chief Earl 
Wetzel how I had been duped by a Stan Musial impostor. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, Scoop, there ain't no law says a man can't claim he's Stan Musial," 
Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
But Detective Henry Cook took me aside. "Let's go do down to the hotel and 
check that guy out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take Cook long to learn that the man was Richard Edward Brame, 24, of 
Baytown, Tex., who had left a trail of bad checks from California to Biloxi and 
passed a bad check in New Orleans to purchase the 1947 Fleetline Chevrolet he 
was driving. 
</P>
<P>
The good news was I got two more stories out of the Musial incident. The AP 
moved both of them nationwide, and they ran in the Daily Herald under the 
headlines: "MAN WHO POSED AS BASEBALL STAR HELD IN BILOXI" and "FAKE BASEBALL 
PLAYER ADMITS HE CASHED SEVEN BAD CHECKS." 
</P>
<P>
For years after the Musial story, I could walk down Howard Avenue, Biloxi's 
main street, and people would holler, "Hey, Stan the Man!" 
</P>
<P>
At the Stan Musial Society meeting this week, "Stan the Man" and several 
Cardinal executives sitting at the head table doubled over in laughter at 
hearing the story behind the story. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time," Musial said, "but I do remember something about a 
fellow posing as me and passing bad checks. I think I was in Albany attending a 
banquet when the papers said I was in Biloxi." 
</P>
<P>
Although still widely recognized as one of the truly great sports heroes of our 
time, Musial remains a down-to-earth kind of guy who's happy to talk baseball 
with fans. 
</P>
<P>
Having waited 41 years for the opportunity to meet him, I left the meeting with 
a Cardinal lapel pen, a Stan Musial baseball card signed by "The Man" and a 
promise that I would be receiving an autographed copy of a new home video, "The 
Legend of Stan the Man Musial." 
</P>
<P>
It was worth the wait. The real Stan Musial was everything a sports-crazy 
19-year-old had imagined he was.

MIKE DOWNEY: FOOTBALL PLAYED BY 11, NOT 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Raiders and the Chicago Bears occupying the same stadium Sunday, it is 
astonishing to think that a serious concern at the Coliseum is how violent the 
crowd might be. 
</P>
<P>
Few men on either of these NFL teams have ever turned the other cheek when it 
came to a fight. More often than not, any cheek that did get turned was on the 
receiving end of a fist. But the incident involving that Pittsburgh Steelers 
fan last Sunday was enough to turn the stomach of even the meanest Raider or 
Bear, including the stomach of Refrigerator Perry, which takes considerable 
turning. 
</P>
<P>
Some badfella who fancies himself a fan of the Raiders took exception to the 
enthusiastic support some other character was offering to the visiting 
Steelers, so he proceeded to turn the guy's face into chop suey. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, he beat on the poor guy for close to three minutes before security 
was able to intervene. At a prizefight, that's an entire round. Tyson-Spinks 
didn't last three minutes. You can do extensive cosmetic surgery, given three 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Well, stadium officials can do only so much. They can ban booze. They can 
inspect bags. They can beef up security. 
</P>
<P>
But they can't read people's minds, and they can't baby-sit every single person 
in every single seat at every single football game. 
</P>
<P>
So, you buy your ticket, you take your chances. 
</P>
<P>
No longer is it safe to sit at a football game. We now have hooligans, same as 
soccer. Wherever you go, some Mr. Potatohead is going to be seated someplace 
near you, spoiling for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, it's the fans who will have to wear protective equipment at 
football games. Shoulder pads, helmets and cups. 
</P>
<P>
Husbands will be pounding their wives on both shoulders before games. 
</P>
<P>
"Ready, honey?" 
</P>
<P>
"Ready, dear." 
</P>
<P>
"OK! Let's go spectate!" 
</P>
<P>
Crowds will get louder and meaner. They'll start asking the players to keep the 
noise down. Teams will be penalized 15 yards after a touchdown for every fan 
who gets spiked. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this is a direct result of the continuing misbegotten effort to involve 
fans in NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
Coast to coast, football teams on every level brag about their home crowds 
being their "12th man." 
</P>
<P>
Well, I don't know about you, but I don't go to football games to watch any 
12th man. I go to watch the 11 men. 
</P>
<P>
What we get is a steady increase of one team's crowd attempting to top 
another's. Seattle is loud, so Houston wants to be louder. Cleveland's fans 
bark, so Cincinnati's coach tries to whip his into a lather. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the fans who show up with painted faces, making themselves look 
as though they just got back from robbing a bank somewhere in Gotham City. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the fans who spend an inordinate amount of time at every 
football game attempting to persuade everyone in their section to do one of 
those wave-things. 
</P>
<P>
The wave is the worst thing that ever happened to sports in America, with the 
possible exception of Dave Kingman. 
</P>
<P>
During Michael Chang's Davis Cup tennis match the other day, the audience 
started doing a wave. This, heaven help us, happened in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Austria gives us Mozart and a nice boys' choir, and what do we give back? The 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well. Fans just don't want to be left out of the action, I suppose. They 
want to feel they are part of the game -- including the guy who sits there 
every week with the Bible sign, which, heaven help me, has never once gotten me 
to read my Bible. 
</P>
<P>
Matter of fact, if this guy would just agree to stay away from every American 
stadium for one year, I would agree to memorize my Bible from cover to cover. 
</P>
<P>
At least, some fans are relatively harmless at sporting events. They stay out 
of your way. 
</P>
<P>
But let's talk for one minute about these people who won't just sit down and 
watch the damn game. 
</P>
<P>
I do wish these people who take it upon themselves to walk all over the 
stadium, carrying banners supporting their team, whooping it up, playfully 
taunting the home team, would go back to their seats and sit in them. 
</P>
<P>
That's what your ticket to a football game is supposed to buy you -- a seat. Go 
sit on it. 
</P>
<P>
At a hockey game in Detroit once, an old guy socked me in the spine. I turned 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"Put that out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Put what out?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That cigarette," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't smoke," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you better not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like I was saying, it can get rough up there in the stands. Let's not make it 
any rougher. The disabled list is supposed to be for the players.

RED INK IS NOW BLACK AT LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new owners of Los Alamitos Race Course, to the astonishment of many, find 
themselves in a rather unusual position -- on the brink of profitability. 
</P>
<P>
The track, in recent years considered a white elephant, was sold to Hollywood 
Park in 1984 for $58 million. But it wasn't long before it was so deep in red 
ink that the survival of the parent Inglewood track was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Arnold and Chris Bardis, who represented harness racing interests, won a 
bitter struggle to buy the track and adjoining property for $72 million last 
November. Some viewed the purchase as foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing happened on their way to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Many bettors who had stopped coming to Los Alamitos returned. Attendance and 
handle at the harness meeting increased 25%. Arnold, in a spirited salvo 
directed at the former owners, even draped an "Under New Management" sign 
across the back of the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
After four months, Arnold and Bardis sold half of the track, which consisted of 
125 of the 297 acres they had bought, for $16.5 million to the quarter horse 
interests who had opposed them in the original purchase. Ed Allred's Quarter 
Racing, Inc., made the purchase, and R.D. Hubbard took an option for a quarter 
of the track from Quarter Racing, Inc. Allred and Hubbard had made a series of 
legal maneuvers a few years ago that made the track very difficult to operate 
under any ownership. 
</P>
<P>
So, Arnold and Bardis were suddenly partners with men they been feuding with 
for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Arnold and Bardis sold the golf course property next to Los Alamitos to 
Dye Design, a Colorado golf development corporation, for $34 million. Dye plans 
to build an upscale golf resort on the site. Hollywood Park had shut down the 
golf course, claiming it had little value. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold and Bardis are in negotiation to sell two parcels of land to undisclosed 
buyers for $6 million and $8 million. All of which still leaves Arnold and 
Bardis with 44 acres, 33 of which can be developed for offices and businesses. 
Independent realtors estimate the value at about $1 million an acre. 
</P>
<P>
So did Lloyd Arnold, an unassuming track manager with country charm, and Chris 
Bardis, a Sacramento lawyer, merely get lucky or were they men of great vision? 
</P>
<P>
A little of each, it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, Allred and Bardis, in separate interviews, each claimed little credit 
for the track's recent success. Instead, they chose to allege that Hollywood 
Park officials mismanaged the track. 
</P>
<P>
"We've cleaned up the track because it was filthy," Arnold said. "We're 
treating people like we want them to come. It's just common sense that you have 
to treat people right. You have to feed them good food at a reasonable price, 
and you also have to have a clean facility." 
</P>
<P>
Bardis pointed more directly at Marje Everett, the chief operating officer at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"They just botched it up so bad, it was an easy act to follow," Bardis said. 
"Everything you could conceivably do wrong, they did. Where (Everett) did 
nothing to enhance racing, we did a lot. Where she was closing down golf 
courses, we were putting them up." 
</P>
<P>
That theme is somewhat explained and partially colored by the recent 
announcement by Hubbard that he plans to stage a proxy fight to take over 
control of Hollywood Park. Hubbard would even choose not to exercise his option 
to buy a quarter of Los Alamitos if the California Horse Racing Board sees his 
ownership in both properties as a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard was in the Soviet Union, where his art collection was on exhibit and 
could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Don Robbins, executive vice president of Hollywood Park, reached in Northern 
California Thursday, said, "It is unfortunate that they (Los Alamitos owners) 
have decided, for whatever reasons, to engage in personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that they are doing well. But they aren't doing quite as well 
as their public relations releases would have you believe. They just recently 
completed a summer quarter horse meeting in which the on-track handle was down 
10% from what it was at the same time the previous year that we had it. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they have benefited from a change in legislation that allows them 
to send their racing program signal state wide (to off-track betting 
facilities); we were confined to Southern California. Also, they are running 
12- and 13-race programs, where we used to run nine and 10." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos, like most race tracks, is more valuable as real estate than as a 
gambling facility. The selling of property has been a key to making the deal 
work. When all of the non-race track property is sold, Arnold and Bardis will 
have, basically, acquired the race track for nothing and still a profit of 
about $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a nice deal; they are smart," said Jeff Rhodes, who was commissioned 
by Hollywood Park to sell the property to Arnold and Bardis. "They were in 
control and they are going to make a lot of money eventually. But with all the 
legal problems the track had, it was still a courageous deal." 
</P>
<P>
The legal problems were solved when Arnold and Bardis went to Allred and 
Hubbard and offered to make them partners in a marriage of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
When Arnold, Allred and Bardis were asked if they ever envisioned themselves 
being partners, each answered with an emphatic, "No!" 
</P>
<P>
"Chris Bardis is the last guy I ever thought would work with us," Allred said. 
"I didn't know him, but I detested everything about him. Now, I consider him a 
good friend and a close ally." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold echoed the sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be lying if I said I thought we'd ever be partners with Doc Allred," 
he said. "There was a lot of skepticism on our part and a lot of skepticism on 
their part. They didn't totally trust us and we didn't totally trust them. But 
now there is trust and the partnership is working." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the owners have been fighting more with their respective horsemen than 
with one another. Several harness drivers filed suit against Arnold when he 
imposed minimum driving standards in an attempt to improve the quality of 
racing. Arnold eventually won the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold recently announced that he would be running a harness racing meet at 
Pomona's Fairplex Park, starting Oct. 26, in the first step toward establishing 
year-round racing in Southern California. The meeting will directly oppose the 
quarter horse meeting at Los Alamitos and probably will cut into its handle. 
</P>
<P>
"We supported their position at Pomona very strongly, but I couldn't get my own 
(quarter-horse) horsemen to support it," Allred said. "The horsemen don't 
understand that we have to do this to benefit both breeds, and that we also 
need to run elsewhere to get year-round racing." 
</P>
<P>
Allred would also like to run at Fairplex and later at a proposed race track he 
would build in Riverside. The California Horse Racing Board will hear final 
arguments on Fairplex racing at its monthly meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
"The harness horsemen have been more helpful to us than our own people," Allred 
said. "In fact, our own people have been in opposition to us. While I'm 
certainly not a harness person, I've gained a new respect for the cooperation 
that we've gotten from them and wish our own people were in the same league." 
</P>
<P>
The final obstacle for the owners is to get the attendance and handle to higher 
levels. During the first harness meeting last spring, Arnold needed an average 
nightly handle of $825,000 to break even. He averaged $818,000 a night, 
including off-track wagering. Because the track deals in only 8% of the handle, 
the rest going back to bettors and the state, his loss was about $560 a night. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter horse meeting has a break-even point of $925,000 a night and the 
track averaged $1.03 million, leaving a $1.4-million pretax profit. 
</P>
<P>
Off-track betting is the eventual answer. The owners hope to one day have 
daytime off-track betting at Los Alamitos, a move opposed by Santa Anita and 
Hollywood Park. Los Alamitos was able to conduct off-track wagering during 
parts of the Del Mar meeting and made about $15,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
A symbiotic relationship exists among all breeds and, although conventional 
wisdom says off-track wagering during the day will affect the handle at night, 
the added income is necessary if nighttime racing is to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a year or two to get there," Bardis said. "Things were 
pretty much down in the dumps, and it's not going to happen overnight. I'm not 
predicting a big recovery for the harness or quarter horse people until the 
latter part of next year." 
</P>
<P>
Even at that, it's a recovery that seemed next to impossible just a year ago.

The Houston Rockets traded much-traveled guard John Lucas and injured center 
Tim McCormick to the Atlanta Hawks for guards Kenny Smith and Roy Marble 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the sixth selection in the 1987 draft, was traded by the Sacramento 
Kings to Atlanta midway through last season. He averaged 11.9 points a game 
overall, but 7.7 points in 33 games with the Hawks. 
</P>

ALL-STARS FROM MAJOR SOCCER LEAGUE PLAY U.S. TEAM

<P>
The Major Soccer League, whose players complained that they were overlooked 
when the United States selected its team for last summer's World Cup, will have 
two chances this weekend to impress U.S. Coach Bob Gansler. 
</P>
<P>
The MSL All-Stars meet the national team tonight at Kansas City's Arrowhead 
Stadium and Sunday at St. Louis' Soccer Park. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has lost several starters from its World Cup team to the 
European professional leagues, but it still has both forwards, Peter Vermes and 
Bruce Murray. In a 3-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago two weeks ago, Murray 
became the United States' all-time leading scorer with his 10th full 
international goal. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record of nine was held by midfielder Rick Davis, who will be 
playing for the MSL All-Stars. RANDY HARVEY

BIG GAME SPLITS A TEXAS TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: PERENNIAL STATE POWER ODESSA PERMIAN HIGH HAS BEEN PENALIZED 
AFTER A RIVAL, ODESSA HIGH, TURNED IT IN FOR PRACTICING OUT OF SEASON. THEY 
PLAY TONIGHT.

If there was any doubt how important high school football is in Texas, listen 
up. 
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil reached $40 a barrel this week, which should make the 
West Texas town of Odessa delirious. That's the kind of news that could snap an 
oil town's depression, which is just about what Odessa has been in for the 
better part of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the important news in town. No sir, not when the town's two high 
schools, Odessa High and state champion Permian, meet tonight in their annual 
game. Not when Permian has been portrayed in a new book as a football program 
seeped in a win-at-all-costs mentality that overrides education. And especially 
not when Permian has been banned from this year's playoffs because Odessa's 
coach told state authorities about Permian's illegal summer practices. 
</P>
<P>
Odessa is in the midst of a furor that is tearing the community asunder, the 
local paper contends. 
</P>
<P>
Odessa High Coach Jerry Taylor is being reviled as a traitor, and school 
officials are begging students to stay calm. It's anyone's guess what will 
happen tonight at the sold-out game, but authorities are taking no chances. 
Police are expected in force. 
</P>
<P>
H.G. Bissinger, the author of the book on Permian, "Friday Night Lights," had 
planned a book signing in Odessa on game day, but canceled after he was 
threatened by Permian boosters. Locals say Bissinger made a good call. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some real fanatics out there who don't appreciate their football 
season being messed up like this," said Kathy Wilson, an Odessa native. "People 
out here take their football seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Permian plays in a $6-million football stadium equipped with Astroturf and 
19,500 seats. Coveted season tickets are willed from one generation to the 
next. Junior high teams run Permian plays so often that they're second nature 
by the time the kids reach high school. All of which may be the reason Odessa 
High is known for its vocational training programs, and affluent Permian High 
holds five 5-A state football championship trophies. 
</P>
<P>
Odessa High hasn't beaten Permian in the annual intra-city game in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Permian is a machine," said Taylor, who says he got tired of what he calls a 
"flaunting of the rules" by the Permian coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In August, after witnessing what he said were numerous rules violations by 
Permian, Taylor complained to the state scholastic authorities. After hearings 
last week, two Permian coaches were suspended for two games and the school was 
barred from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We contend we did not violate any . . . rules, and if we did it was a complete 
misunderstanding of how the rules should be interpreted," said a still-fuming 
Permian Coach Tam Hollingshead. Hollingshead maintains that the summer 
practices were voluntary, and that the coaches were only present to protect the 
athletic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
School district Athletic Director John Wilkins, who oversees the football 
programs at both schools, likened the penalty to "giving life imprisonment for 
stealing a pack of gum at the 7-Eleven." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Treece, a 1963 Permian graduate and assistant dean of the South Texas 
Law School in Houston, is attempting to overturn the ruling on grounds that 
Permian was denied due process during the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Others have already taken the matter into their own hands. Cars parked at 
Odessa High have been plastered with Permian High School State Champion bumper 
stickers. Across town, Permian students found their cars shoe polished with 
obscenities demeaning "Mojo," a school nickname for the Permian football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it stinks," said Odessa-native Wilson, an Odessa High graduate whose 
son attends Permian. "The boys shouldn't be punished for something adults might 
have done." 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Byington, a member of the committee that imposed the penalties, said, 
"We need to send a message to all coaches in the state that this type of 
activity will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor says he has received nasty phone calls and notes, even car bomb threats. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was the messenger, people blame me for splitting the town, but my 
personal opinion is this thing was self-inflicted by Permian," he said. "There 
is a feeling on Permian's part that they're invincible, that the rules are for 
other folks but not them. It was a severe punishment, but it had to be to get 
their attention." 
</P>
<P>
Permian and Odessa High both have 2-1 records. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a war," predicted 16-year-old Chad Sandell, a former Permian 
player. "Anyone wearing Odessa High red is history, on the field or off."

OAK PARK WANTS QUICK ACTION ON CITYHOOD REQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to block neighboring Simi Valley's bid to annex Jordan Ranch, an Oak 
Park group said Thursday it has requested that the Local Agency Formation 
Commission speed up consideration of its request for cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council said it has written to 
LAFCO requesting that the agency provide an early ruling on the request at a 
meeting Oct. 17, the same day LAFCO is scheduled to consider Simi Valley's 
request for an early ruling on the proposed annexation of the Jordan property. 
</P>
<P>
The Oak Park group's request would be a first step toward incorporation. It has 
proposed annexing both the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch and the nearby 5,547-acre 
Ahmanson Ranch once it incorporates. 
</P>
<P>
But incorporation would be a lengthy process, possibly taking as long as two 
years, LAFCO officials said. The advisory council would have to conduct a study 
of whether the area has enough tax base to support a city and to gather enough 
signatures to hold an election on cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
If LAFCO assures Simi Valley that it can annex the Jordan property, Oak Park's 
request for cityhood might be stymied, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want it on a fast track," Ron Stark, a member of the advisory council, said 
of the cityhood effort. "We wouldn't want Simi to get that land before we 
present our case." 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO Executive Director Bob Braitman said Thursday that he had not received 
the letter from Oak Park. Although the LAFCO board is scheduled to consider 
only Simi Valley's request, it could review both requests at the same time, 
Braitman said. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park officials said development proposed for the Jordan and Ahmanson 
properties would require more schools and better roads in their area. 
</P>
<P>
The Oak Park council is scheduled to hold a public forum on the incorporation 
effort Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The small community, sandwiched between Thousand Oaks and the Jordan Ranch 
property, has about 10,000 residents, according to county planners. 
</P>
<P>
The council serves as an advisory body to the county, but it does not have the 
authority to decide land-use issues. Cityhood would give residents the 
authority to seek land annexations. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park should have more control over the Jordan Ranch annexation because 
development proposed for the property is closer to it than Simi Valley, said 
Pitt Gilmore, a council member. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ahmanson Land Co. and representatives of Potomac Investment 
Associates, which has an option to buy Jordan Ranch from entertainer Bob Hope, 
have said they are open to the idea of Oak Park incorporating and annexing the 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Developments proposed for the Jordan and Ahmanson properties would usher into 
the area about 11,000 new residents and 240 acres of commercial, office and 
retail space, a county environmental report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
To annex Jordan Ranch, Simi Valley must complete a General Plan amendment, a 
costly and lengthy process that could take up to two years, Braitman said. 
</P>
<P>
To become a city, the Oak Park community must conduct a financial study and 
gather enough signatures to place the incorporation issue on the ballot. The 
process could also take up to two years, Braitman said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said Oak Park should not be threatened by his 
city's request for an early ruling. LAFCO's denial of a speedy ruling for Simi 
Valley could pave the way for the community's incorporation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were Oak Park, I would want this decision by LAFCO made as quickly as 
possible," he said.

U.S. TO SEEK SLAVE CASE TESTIMONY IN MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMES: UNDER PROSECUTORS' PROPOSAL, FORMER EMPLOYEES OF SOMIS RANCHER EDWIN M. 
IVES WOULD BE BUSED FROM REMOTE VILLAGES TO THE MEXICAN CAPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors on Monday will ask to take most of the testimony in the 
slavery trial of Somis flower rancher Edwin M. Ives in Mexico City so his 
former employees can be bused from rural Indian villages to testify. 
</P>
<P>
If U.S. District Court Judge Consuelo Marshall grants the request, it will mark 
the first time that testimony used at an U.S. trial is given primarily in a 
foreign country, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam has asked Marshall to allow the testimony of 
67 people to be taken in the Mexican capital to avoid the cost of flying 
witnesses to Los Angeles and to encourage them to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no way to compel these people to come up here," Gillam said in an 
interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses are mostly Zapotec and Mixtec Indians who live in villages so 
rural that Spanish is a second language. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that they were smuggled to Ives' 50-acre Somis compound 
during the 1980s, forced to work for about $1 per hour and to buy food and 
sundries at inflated prices from a company store. Ives, 54, six ranch overseers 
and an alleged smuggler are charged in a 15-count indictment alleging civil 
rights and labor violations. 
</P>
<P>
In other federal cases, one or two witnesses who have refused to come to this 
country have been questioned under oath abroad, Gillam said, "but never in 
these numbers. Of course, there's never been a case like this, so we'll be 
doing a lot of things that have never been done before." 
</P>
<P>
The Ives prosecution is the most far-reaching slavery case ever filed by the 
United States, Gillam has said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Talcott, an Ives attorney, said he will oppose the prosecution's 
motion on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Out-of-court testimony "is absolutely unheard of on the scale that's being 
proposed here," he said. "It's almost a joke. They are doing this because they 
are trying to hide something." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 67 witnesses to be called in Mexico are also listed as defense 
witnesses, Talcott said. And in interviews with his investigators, they support 
Ives' contention that he has done nothing wrong, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Talcott said the request is an attempt by the government to maintain control 
over unsophisticated witnesses who could undermine the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been told that these are exceedingly naive, impressionable villagers, 
and everything that has been done by the government appears to ensure that no 
rays of light will ever reach them," Talcott said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Mexican government officials, perhaps even Mexican police, will pick up 
the villagers, transport them to Mexico City and provide them with room and 
board before they testify. 
</P>
<P>
"It places a chill on their testimony," and raises questions about their 
independence, he said. If they lie on the stand, no perjury charges can be 
brought against them because they will not be within the jurisdiction of a 
federal court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillam disagreed. She said the witnesses will not be assisted by the Mexican 
government, but by representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no police involved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If Judge Marshall consents, federal prosecutors and eight attorneys for Ives 
and the other defendants will question witnesses in Mexico during November and 
the first two weeks of December. 
</P>
<P>
Most witnesses will brought in small buses over dirt roads to Mexico City, a 
journey of about 11 hours in good weather, Gillam said. Their questioning will 
be videotaped and Marshall will edit inadmissible comments from the tape before 
it is shown to a jury during the trial, which is scheduled for March. 
</P>
<P>
Talcott said the job of reviewing and editing the tapes places a mind-boggling 
burden on the judge. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign testimony is also likely to be very expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Talcott has asked the judge to order the prosecution to pay for the defense's 
travel and hotel rooms in Mexico City. Defendants also have a right to observe 
the testimony and could seek reimbursement for travel expenses, he said.

WATER USE IN AUGUST 18% BELOW '89 LEVEL

<P>
Ventura water customers reduced consumption during the month of August compared 
with last year, but only by 18.4%, city officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that water savings dropped below the 20% mark since a 
mandatory conservation program began in June. 
</P>
<P>
The decrease in water savings is attributable to an unusually hot summer and to 
the fact that under the mandatory program adopted last March, the city makes 
more water available during the summer, said Carol Green, Ventura's public 
works spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Green said most of the violators -- who face fines of four times the amount of 
the normal water rate for every gallon they consume in excess of their 
allocation -- were barely above the limits. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

ARGUMENT BREWS OVER WATER RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura and its largest water supplier, the Casitas Municipal Water District, 
are battling over whose water conservation rules apply inside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ventura has reduced its reliance on Lake Casitas water by 30% this 
year, the dispute is prompting Casitas directors to consider rationing 
Ventura's supply. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of at loggerheads with them, but we're still negotiating," said 
James W. Coultas, Casitas board president. "We feel it would be unfair to allow 
things inside the city limits we wouldn't allow outside." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura officials says Casitas may not have the legal right to impose its rules 
inside the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Casitas water district, which includes about half the city west of Mills 
Road, provides 40% of Ventura's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The district and the city imposed different bans on water hookups in April. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's hookup ban exempts some building projects that Casitas refuses to 
allow for at least another year in the Ojai Valley. Lots for single family 
houses, business expansions and affordable housing projects that can still 
receive city water are denied by Casitas unless issued a promise letter before 
April. 
</P>
<P>
'We are continuing to talk to Casitas about our concerns about the 
differences," said Carole Green, city spokeswoman. 'We are certainly complying 
with their ordinance and our ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
While Ventura has not promised water to any projects Casitas would deny, 
Coultas said city officials have indicated they may do so soon. THIA BELL

Oxnard police evacuated nearly 100 customers and employees from a Sav-On-Drugs 
store Thursday night and searched with a police dog for a man wanted on 
suspicion of attempted murder, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified by police as Samuel McCowan, 20, of Oxnard was not found, 
but another sought in the same case was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller reported seeing the two men near the drugstore at 5th 
Street and Ventura Road about 7 p.m. Police went there and arrested John Dion 
Hill, 18, of Oxnard on suspicion of attempted murder. They then evacuated the 
drugstore and searched it. 
</P>
<P>
The case began with a shooting incident Wednesday night, Police Sgt. John 
Chrombach said. Two men entered the apartment of Kim Revis, 22, in the 500 
block of South K Street, Chrombach said. Revis ran upstairs and the intruders 
fired at her with a small handgun. When they left the apartment, Revis' 
boyfriend chased them in the street and fired a handgun. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

CONCRETE FIRM'S EXPANSION LIMITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vigorous citizen protest prompted the Fillmore City Council to place 
restrictions on the proposed expansion of a concrete pipe manufacturing company 
in the city's industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour hearing this week was the second council session on the proposal 
by Hurst Concrete Products, and it followed two meetings of a group of 
citizens, council members and Hurst staff who tried to forge a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
July 5, Hurst Concrete was granted a conditional permit by the Planning 
Commission to operate 24 hours a day and expand a storage yard. An appeal was 
filed by Bill Boren, whose residence is next to the facility, and the 
commission's decision was criticized by other residents, who said that Hurst 
has consistently violated the conditions of a permit granted in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously this week to limit plant operations to 7 a.m. to 
7 p.m., although cleaning operations and emptying of a kiln will extend the 
workday by two hours each weekday. No more than seven truck departures will be 
permitted at night. Saturday operations will be permitted only 15 times a year, 
and Hurst must notify city staff in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst also will be required to reduce noise, particularly from forklifts and 
from a vaporizing unit used for curing concrete, which emits "a consistent 
high-pitched whine and runs all night long," according to plant manager Al 
Franzen. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive landscaping will be required, as it was under the original permit. 
</P>
<P>
To assure compliance, Hurst will be subject to inspection twice during 1991 and 
every two years after the company meets permit requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of no other project that has been subject to such rigorous conditions," 
said Community Development Director Mary Ann Krause. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the dozen-plus residents who attended Tuesday's council meeting said 
that restrictions added to the permit did not reflect their views and would not 
actually remedy noise and dust problems, which they said harm the quality of 
life and property values. JANET BERGAMO

Sheriff's detectives recovered $6,400 in stolen stereo equipment and arrested 
two Newbury Park teen-agers in connection with two burglaries at the local high 
school this summer, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, ages 17 and 18, were arrested on suspicion of felony burglary 
charges, Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Joe Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old will be tried as a juvenile because he was 17 when the crimes 
were committed. He faces an additional charge of possession of stolen property, 
Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, burglars entered Newbury Park High School on Reno Road through a 
window and removed $1,400 worth of stereo speakers from the wall, Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, $5,000 worth of stereo equipment, including amplifiers and 
cassette decks, were taken, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Braga said the equipment was recovered Wednesday night and was returned to the 
school Thursday afternoon. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

Ventura County residents who lost relatives in the Holocaust may get 
information from recently opened Soviet archives through the local chapter of 
the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The archives contain material recovered by the Soviet Army during the 
liberation of concentration camps at the close of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Included are 70,000 death certificates from Auschwitz in Poland and the names 
of 130,000 prisoners forced into labor in Germany. Also released were the names 
of 200,000 other victims from camps in Sachsenhausen, Gross Rosen and 
Buchenwald. 
</P>
<P>
A search through the lists would be done by the Holocaust and War Victims 
Tracing Center in Baltimore and could take one to two years, a Red Cross 
representative said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

4 ROCKWELL CRITICS TO ADVISE FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE GROUP WILL MONITOR THE CLEANUP OF THE COMPANY'S SANTA SUSANA 
FIELD LAB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Four citizen activists and critics of Rockwell International became 
semiofficial advisers to the firm Monday when they were installed as members of 
a government task force monitoring cleanup of the company's Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Raskin, Dan Hirsch and Barbara Johnson -- all active in the successful 
fight to stop nuclear work at the site in the Simi Hills -- attended their 
first meeting as members of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory Work Group, which 
is chaired by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon Plotkin, another anti-nuclear activist named to the panel, did not 
attend Monday's meeting at Simi Valley City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The work group, which includes representatives of several health and 
environmental agencies, meets quarterly for updates on environmental testing 
and cleanup at Santa Susana, where Rockwell formerly did nuclear research for 
the U.S. Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
Appointment of the four activists and of a fifth community member -- Simi 
Valley City Council member Ann Rock -- followed pleas by anti-nuclear activists 
for inclusion of citizen members. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell and Department of Energy officials were displeased with the EPA's 
choice of the four activists. 
</P>
<P>
All are members of the Rocketdyne Cleanup Coalition, an alliance of 
anti-nuclear and neighborhood activists that officials believe has exaggerated 
pollution problems at Santa Susana. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup coalition was named for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, which runs 
the lab in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Facing pressure from the cleanup coalition and declining nuclear business, 
Rockwell announced earlier this year that it would cease nuclear research at 
Santa Susana. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the new task force members -- Plotkin and Hirsch -- are active in groups 
that recently sued the DOE in federal court in San Francisco in an effort to 
stop a government nuclear research project being carried out by Rockwell at the 
University of Missouri. The project, known as TRUMP-S, was transferred to 
Missouri from Santa Susana because of the opposition here. 
</P>
<P>
"DOE was initially quite concerned about some of the individuals" selected for 
the work group, DOE official Roger Liddle conceded during the lunch break 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Liddle said he thought their "integrity will override any personal 
prejudices they may have." 
</P>
<P>
"We would not have recommended these people" but "we're willing to work with 
them," Rocketdyne spokesman Paul Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is involved in a $37.3-million, DOE-funded cleanup of radioactive and 
chemical pollution at Santa Susana. 
</P>
<P>
The six-year cleanup plan includes removal of mostly low-level contamination 
from soil and buildings and upgrading of pollution controls on non-nuclear 
energy research projects still in operation. 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's meeting, Hirsch criticized efforts by state health officials to 
obtain DOE funds for a health study of nearby residents, saying it would be 
more beneficial to first study the health of Santa Susana workers instead. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch said the workers would have received higher radioactive and toxic 
exposures than the public. If workers showed no unusual patterns of disease, 
there would probably be no need to study the surrounding community, Hirsch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Robert Holtzer, a public health medical officer with the state 
Department of Health Services, said the DOE is unlikely to fund an occupational 
study. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the DOE already is arranging for the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services to do occupational health studies at its research and 
weapons sites. 
</P>
<P>
Liddle of the DOE said he would inquire about whether Santa Susana could be 
included in those studies.

WORK-FURLOUGH PROPOSAL DENIED; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: OFFICIALS REJECT A PLAN TO CONVERT A RETIREMENT HOTEL INTO AN 
ALTERNATE JAIL FACILITY, CITING CONCERN FOR THE FATE OF THE HOME'S 80 ELDERLY 
RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Planning Commission on Thursday rejected a proposal for a prisoners' 
work-furlough residence in Studio City -- but not until commission President 
William G. Luddy strongly condemned what he termed "a Willie Horton staff 
report" for pandering to neighbors' fears. 
</P>
<P>
Luddy also criticized the program's sponsors for failing to address parking 
and, more important, the fate of 80 elderly residents who would be displaced by 
conversion of their boarding house into an alternate jail facility. 
</P>
<P>
When an owner of the home said residents could choose to remain there once it 
becomes a work-furlough facility, Luddy and his colleagues expressed disbelief 
and called for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"A Willie Horton report; a Frankenstein proposal," Luddy said after the 
commission unanimously denied the program a conditional use permit. 
</P>
<P>
His reference to Willie Horton recalled the controversial political ads of 
President George Bush's campaign, which tried to discredit opponent Michael 
Dukakis by linking him to a state prison furlough program approved prior to his 
election as Massachusetts governor. Horton, a black convicted murderer, raped a 
white woman after escaping from a weekend furlough. 
</P>
<P>
Luddy said later he characterized the work-furlough proposal itself as 
"Frankenstein" because it appeared to be a "pieced-together monster," hastily 
conceived to bail out a failing board-and-care home. 
</P>
<P>
Only 80 of the home's 146 beds are filled, and the facility is losing $10,000 a 
month, its operator, Donald Gormly, said. 
</P>
<P>
The rejected plan called for changing the Ventura Retirement Villa, at 11201 
Ventura Blvd., into a residence for nonviolent lawbreakers. Participants, most 
of them convicted on drunk-driving charges, would have been allowed to continue 
working at their own jobs while serving their jail sentences. 
</P>
<P>
No one with a history of violence would have been eligible, said Carl E. 
Curtis, director of Los Angeles County's work-furlough program. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, part of an effort to ease jail overcrowding, would have been the 
second of its kind in the county. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's meeting at the Van Nuys Woman's Club, Curtis testified that 
he was dismayed by hearing examiner Richard M. Takase's repeated use of the 
word convict in his staff report. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said the word convict connotes "a dangerous, predatory felon," and was 
an unfair description of his program's participants. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Takase exaggerated the program's dangers by describing how the 
drunk drivers -- denied the use of their driver's licenses -- would stand in 
the same lines as the public while waiting for city buses. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 16 people who testified Thursday opposed the plan, many of them 
elderly, longtime residents of the neighborhood. One Chiquita Street mother, 
Julie Boyd, said she considered drunk drivers dangerous because she was once 
involved in a head-on crash with one and might have been killed if not for her 
seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
After the public testimony, Luddy called Takase's report outrageous and 
unprofessional, and said it "goes off into scare tactics." 
</P>
<P>
Takase said later that he was surprised by Luddy's comments and that "I was 
certainly not kowtowing to any crowd." 
</P>
<P>
He said the criteria for granting a conditional use permit included "finding 
that the location will be desirable to the public convenience or welfare," so 
he was obligated to note the program's lack of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
His report was based on an Aug. 20 hearing.

HIKERS TO PAY FEES AT SOME STATE PARKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some state parks will begin charging hikers and bikers $2, and parking fees at 
many parks have been raised to make up for a shortfall caused by a $16-million 
budget cut to the state park system, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Point Mugu State Park will raise the parking fee $2, to $6 a car. 
</P>
<P>
Point Mugu will also charge walk-in fees of $2 for adults and $1 for children 
over 6. The same fees will be charged at Topanga State Park and Will Rogers 
State Historic Park. San Buenaventura State Beach, which includes the San Jon 
beach area and the Ventura Pier, will charge $5 per car as soon as new parking 
equipment is installed. 
</P>
<P>
The district also includes McGrath State Beach, Emma Wood State Beach and 
Carpinteria State Beach in Santa Barbara County, where parking fees have been 
raised from $4 to $5. Rincon Point, used mainly by surfers, will remain free.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TO CHANGE DEFENSE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 156 to 254, the House rejected a conservative-led attempt to 
soften military personnel cuts and increase from 180 to 360 days the maximum 
time on active duty for reservists. This occurred as the House sent to 
conference with the Senate the Pentagon's first post-Cold War budget, a 
$283-billion fiscal 1991 spending bill that is $24 billion under President 
Bush's request. 
</P>
<P>
The current uniformed personnel ceiling is 1.9 million. This motion sought to 
lower it by about 101,500 troops, not 130,000 as recommended by the 
Democratic-led Armed Services Committee. Bush wants a cut of 38,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
The longer deployment of reservists would have permitted reserve combat units 
to be sent to the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon finds the present 180-day limit 
too short to justify combat roles for reservists, given how long it takes to 
put them in place. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Army personnel should not be deeply cut 
while "the Army is the primary provider of troop strength in Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly B. Byron (D-Md.) said the Persian Gulf crisis should not be used "as an

To Cut SDI Funding 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 225 to 189 to lower Strategic Defense Initiative funding to a 
maintenance level of $2.3 billion for fiscal 1991, about half of President 
Bush's request for the proposedspace-based defense system designed to deflect 
incoming missiles. The vote occurred during debate on the 1991 Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Tom Ridge (R-Pa.) said: "The SDI mission continues to evolve -- the 
leakproof shield is history and now we are only discussing enhanced 
deterrence." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) asked why SDI backers "have to keep 
promising members that if New York disappears off the face of the map with some 
Saddam Hussein bomb, we are not supposed to say to you, 'We told you so."' 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cut SDI spending to a maintenance level.

Abortion Issue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 200 to 216, the House rejected an amendment permitting women in 
the military or who are dependents to receive an abortion at military 
facilities abroad if they pay for it. The amendment to the 1991 defense bill 
(above) sought to lift a Department of Defense ban on such abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) said the amendment would ensure decent medical 
care for women defending freedom "in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere throughout 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Barbara F. Vucanovich (R-Nev.) said the amendment would lead to 
"abortion on demand at any overseas installation." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to permit privately financed abortions at military hospitals 
abroad.

CONTAMINANTS DETECTED IN COMPANIES' DISPOSAL WELLS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: EPA ORDERS CAR DEALER AND TIRE STORE TO FIND NEW WAYS OF DISPOSING 
OF THEIR TAINTED RINSE WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered a Newhall tire store and a 
Lancaster automotive dealership to stop injecting rinse water tainted with 
cancer-causing chemicals into underground disposal wells. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals found at Sierra Toyota Inc. of Lancaster and Daily Tire and 
Automotive Inc. of Newhall are not an immediate health threat, but were found 
in concentrations above federal safety standards, EPA spokeswoman Lois Grunwald 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The two businesses were among five automotive service companies in Los Angeles 
County ordered to correct what federal officials said were violations of the 
Safe Drinking Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of lead, trichloroethane and vinyl chloride in water samples taken 
at the Newhall and Lancaster companies indicates a potential for ground-water 
contamination, Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
At Sierra, for example, EPA samplings found 59 micrograms per liter of 
trichloroethane, well above the safety standard of 5 m.p.l., she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies were ordered to stop injecting water into the wells, to dispose 
of fluids remaining in the wells and to temporarily seal all pipes and floor 
drains leading to the wells. 
</P>
<P>
Known as injection wells, the wells accept water used to rinse work areas and 
then percolates into the ground. At Daily Tire and Sierra Toyota, EPA 
investigators found that oil, degreasing solvents and other chemicals were 
allowed to mix with normal rinse water injected into the wells, rather than 
being cleaned up separately, Grunwald said. There was no evidence that the 
mixing was intentional or malicious, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the EPA order mailed last Friday, the businesses must find alternative 
ways to dispose of the chemicals, such as recycling, Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to do whatever is right to comply with the order," said Leon Graham, 
owner of Daily Tire. "I'm not going to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA also ordered Foothill Chevrolet of La Canada, as well as Trancas Canyon 
Chevron and Ball and Sons Auto Inc., both of Malibu, to take the same remedial 
actions.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEN YELL GANG SLOGANS, SHOOT FIVE PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five people suffered minor injuries when four men walked up to them in front of 
a Panorama City apartment complex and began shooting after yelling gang 
slogans, Los Angeles police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The victims of the shooting, which occurred about 11 p.m. Wednesday in the 7900 
block of Willis Avenue, suffered wounds to the arms or legs. 
</P>
<P>
They were identified as Ruben Araiza, 26; Denise Roacho, 24; Jesus Aguilar, 25; 
Vincente Masa, 33, and Jose Sanchez, 36. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shooting was gang-related but that it was unknown whether the 
victims were associated with any gang. Lt. Warren Knowles said they were 
sitting on steps at the entrance to their apartment complex when four young men 
approached on foot. 
</P>
<P>
"The four men yelled gang slogans, pulled a shotgun and possibly a revolver, 
and opened fire," Knowles said.

BRAGGS' HOME RUN HELPS REDS INCH CLOSER TO TITLE

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glenn Braggs played detective Thursday night to move the Cincinnati Reds a step 
closer to a championship. 
</P>
<P>
Braggs deduced that a fastball was coming from Atlanta's Steve Avery, and he 
lined it for a two-run homer that put the Reds ahead to stay in a 4-2 victory 
at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's magic number was reduced to two as its National League West lead 
grew to five games over the Dodgers with six to play. The Reds have won six of 
their last seven games to put their first title in 11 years within reach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's right around the corner," Braggs said. "It seems like every day someone 
has been coming up with it. Today it's me." 
</P>
<P>
He beat the Braves with logic. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati was held to four hits through five innings by Avery (3-10), who was 
pitching with a blister on a finger of his pitching hand. He became the starter 
when Charlie Leibrandt came down with flu. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie took a 2-1 lead into the sixth inning, then walked Eric Davis. 
Braggs hit the next pitch over the wall in left-center for a 3-2 lead that 
ended Avery's outing. 
</P>
<P>
"The blister ripped open in the first," Avery said. "It really didn't bother me 
on fastballs or change-ups, but it took away my curve." 
</P>
<P>
Braggs knew it, too. "The thing I noticed him doing was throwing mostly 
fastballs," Braggs said. "We figured because of his blister, he didn't want to 
risk throwing any breaking balls. I was looking for that particular pitch, and 
he threw it -- a fastball down and away. I knew when I hit the homer that it 
was a big blow for the team and we would be on our way." 
</P>
<P>
Red starter and winner Tom Browning (15-9) had struggled since spraining his 
left ankle Aug. 17, going 2-2 in his next five starts. 
</P>
<P>
Browning gave up seven hits in the first three innings. He allowed no more hits 
through the seventh to raise his career record against Atlanta to 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble pitched two perfect innings, striking out three, for his 11th save. 
He and Browning combined to retire the last 12 in order. 
</P>
<P>
The only drawback for Cincinnati was a shoulder injury to Davis that forced him 
to leave the game in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
The left fielder slammed into the wall in foul territory after making a catch 
in the sixth, jamming his left shoulder. He rolled on the ground for several 
minutes, had the shoulder examined by trainer Larry Starr, and decided to stay 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Davis led off the bottom of the inning with a full-count walk from Avery and 
let his left arm hang limply as he rounded the bases on Braggs' homer. He was 
replaced in the top of the next inning.

CAR COULD BE LEAD TO PHILLIPS' ATTACKERS 
</P>

<P>
Police appear to have closed in on three men who allegedly attacked Joe 
Phillips, the Chargers' 315-pound nose tackle, and left him bleeding in a 
parking lot with severe head injuries early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Using witness accounts, detectives traced the license plate of a Toyota compact 
car authorities believe the assailants drove from the scene, police spokesman 
Bill Robinson said. The car was found in Linda Vista and impounded Thursday 
afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were not with the vehicle, and no arrests had been made as of late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to identify the suspects" and determine a motive, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson refused to confirm reports in Thursday's San Diego Tribune, attributed 
to a San Diego detective, that the three men will surrender to police today. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not talked to any suspects that I know of," Robinson said. "I will not 
confirm that report." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said police interviewed Phillips at length Thursday at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital, where he was being treated for a concussion, broken bone around his 
eye, broken nose and multiple cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, 27, was prepared to deliver a statement to the media but was advised 
by detectives not to do so, a Charger spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' wife, Cynthia, was also unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Three men beat Phillips early Wednesday in the parking lot of Saska's, a 
Mission Beach restaurant. Phillips was accompanied by a female friend of 
teammate Les Miller, who will start at nose tackle in Phillips' absence. 
Witnesses said the woman was also chased and knocked down during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Miller went to Saska's, a popular night spot for Charger defensive linemen, in 
search of answers Wednesday night and asked a lot of questions but found out 
little. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing I can do," Miller said. "It's still not clear why it happened. The 
questions still haven't been answered. I know more about what happened, but 
that still doesn't tell me why." 
</P>
<P>
Said defensive line coach Gunther Cunningham: "Les Miller is very close to Joe 
Phillips, and you can tell it affected Wednesday's practice. I talked to Les 
about keeping his head; I know what I'd like to do, and I want to say it, but I 
can't. You've got to keep your poise and composure. When something like this 
happens, you just want to go and do something, especially when you deal in the 
business that we deal in, in which head-knocking happens every day." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, Miller said, had been out earlier Tuesday evening with Miller and two 
of his friends, including the woman who was with Phillips at the time of the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very good friend of mine, and both her and her fiance are good friends 
with Joe," Miller said. "We had gone out for sushi earlier in the evening -- 
her fiance doesn't like sushi, and that's why he wasn't out with us. It's no 
big deal. She's just a friend. I mean, her boyfriend knows Joe very well. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel badly I wasn't there with them. It might have been different." 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Lee Williams: "I've been down there (to Saska's) quite a few 
times, that's why I couldn't conceive something like this happening. We'd go in 
groups of three or four. Unfortunately, this was just one of those nights . . . 
because if it was different, I don't want to get into it, but we would have 
whupped some butt." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials continued to refuse to release Phillips' condition or even 
confirm he was a patient there. Lee Rice, the Charger team physician, said 
Phillips will undergo surgery within the week for the eye and nose injuries. 
Rice said he expects Phillips will stay in the hospital until the surgery, 
conflicting with a police report that he might be released today. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it was as severe a beating as I've seen," Rice said. "I think 
anybody thinner or less strong than Joe would have been in real trouble, and 
this certainly could have been a life-threatening situation." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Phillips likely will miss 10 weeks of the season but said he should 
be as strong as before after recovery and suffer no long-term effects. Rice 
said a metal plate will be implanted under the injured eye. 
</P>
<P>
"He actually responded from the concussion pretty well, and in the first 24 
hours he was fully recovered from the concussion, except for a headache," Rice 
said. "But he was alert, and he had his memory intact and had no altered mental 
functioning at all. So I'm not so concerned about the concussion as I am about 
the fractures and the surgery that's going to fix them." 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses and police, the three men made "some pretty innocuous 
comments" to the woman and Phillips, who apparently responded by approaching 
the men's car. The verbal exchange, witnesses said, sparked the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The three men were described as being of medium height and build and in their 
20s. Phillips is known for his tremendous strength in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
The men -- witnesses told police one wore steel-toed boots -- stopped their car 
and "jumped" Phillips, swarming over him and knocking him to the ground, police 
said. Phillips was repeatedly beaten about the head, face and ribs, leaving him 
bloodied, with his T-shirt ripped from his back, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
A witness said the attack lasted between three and five minutes, that the men 
were unarmed and that Phillips apparently was not able to inflict much damage 
upon them. 
</P>
<P>
The Tribune quoted Det. Doug Mahnke, who is investigating the incident, as 
saying the three men did not know Phillips' identity until they saw TV reports 
of the assault. The men are "scared to death" and "petrified" and ready to 
surrender to police, Mahnke was quoted as saying.

FORSAKING HIS LINE OF DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: 'OLD-LINE NFLER' JACK PARDEE HAS A RUN-AND-SHOOT OFFENSE? THAT'S 
EVOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Jack Pardee to be coaching the run-and-shoot offense seems totally out of 
character. 
</P>
<P>
When Pardee was hired by the Chargers in 1981 as assistant head coach in charge 
of defense, newspapers ran such headlines as "Mr. Defense," "Secretary of 
Defense," "Pardee to the Rescue" and "Pardee Puts Touch of Picasso Into 
Chargers' Defense." 
</P>
<P>
Pardee, who played linebacker in the NFL, was so heavily into defense that it 
almost seemed as though taking possession of the ball was offensive to him. In 
six seasons as an NFL head coach -- three each with the Chicago Bears and 
Washington Redskins -- he was noted for his conservative approach to offense. 
</P>
<P>
But here is Pardee today, espousing the aggressive, high-risk run-and-shoot as 
the new coach of the Houston Oilers, who will meet the Chargers Sunday at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Instead of run, run, run, he teaches pass, pass, 
pass. It doesn't figure. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sid Gillman, who coached Pardee with the Rams and worked for him in 
Chicago: "I'm really amazed." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Laslavic, sports director of KNSD (Channel 39), was a linebacker in the 
season Pardee spent with the Chargers. He is equally surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack is one of the last guys I would expect to turn to something so 
revolutionary," Laslavic said. "At least, it's evolutionary. He's an old-line 
NFLer. He played for George Allen, and he coached so conservatively in Chicago 
and Washington. It's hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
If you press Pardee, 54, for an explanation, he makes his change of direction 
appear logical. He even traces his switch to a passing offense -- although not 
necessarily the run-and-shoot -- to his season in San Diego on Don Coryell's 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to a conclusion when I was in San Diego with Coryell," Pardee said. "I 
decided that if you're ever going to do more than beat bad teams, you can't be 
one-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
"Being on the defensive side of the ball, you realize a lot of the things that 
give you problems, and the biggest thing is the pass. You have to run, too, but 
it's hard to do that all the time and win anymore in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
The last statement brought back memories for Don Pierson, a Chicago Tribune 
writer who covered the Bears when Pardee was their coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack was the most defense-minded coach I've ever seen," Pierson said. "He just 
tolerated offense. One time I asked him to list Walter Payton's attributes, and 
the first thing he mentioned was pursuit. He was thinking primarily of what 
Payton did after an interception. 
</P>
<P>
"Sid Gillman was with Pardee in '77 when Payton gained a record 275 yards and 
the Bears won just 10-7 (against Minnesota). Gillman was really upset after 
that game. He said to Pardee, 'How can you have anyone run for 275 yards and 
score only one touchdown?' Sid thought it was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Gillman was a master of the passing game -- perhaps the master -- and couldn't 
help but be frustrated by Pardee's emphasis on the run. When Pardee resigned 
after the 1977 season to take the Washington job, Gillman didn't go with him. 
Instead, he became athletic director at U.S. International. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a clash of personalities between Gillman and Pardee," Pierson said. 
"After bringing Sid in and having him spread out the receivers, Jack totally 
ignored him." 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches denied having had trouble co-existing in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gillman: "Jack was a real great fella, a credit to the coaching 
profession. It was a fine year, and I enjoyed working with him very much. I had 
a little problem with one of the assistants on the defensive side, but it was 
very minor." 
</P>
<P>
And Pardee: "Sid was my first pro coach. I love Sid and Esther (Mrs. Gillman). 
Sid is smart, and he's a strategist without a peer. He taught me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had considered asking Gillman to join him in Washington, Pardee 
said, "I did, yes, but he was kind of anxious to get back out to California." 
</P>
<P>
As complimentary as they are of each other, Gillman doesn't hesitate to say he 
disapproves of Pardee's venture into the run-and-shoot, which dispenses with 
the tight end and calls for four wide receivers and one running back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a run-and-shoot guy," Gillman said. "I just feel that you can't play 
without a tight end. At times, when the situation presents itself, I would use 
four wide receivers and take out the tight end, but certainly not on a regular 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the quarterback works so close to the line of scrimmage, if he 
isn't sacked, he's hit. In the Tampa Bay-Detroit game the other night, Rodney 
Peete almost got killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how long a quarterback will last in that system. He had better be 
able to run." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Gillman's comments, Pardee said, "Sid is from the old school of 
thought, but one of the hardest things to do is to get a tight end to do all 
the things you want a tight end to do. I have more success finding running 
backs and wide receivers than finding tight ends. 
</P>
<P>
"As for getting my quarterback (Warren Moon) hurt, I don't worry about that. If 
he doesn't hold the ball too long and if they don't hit him late, which is 
illegal, he'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Moon is so happy to be working for gentlemanly Pardee instead of much-disliked 
Jerry Glanville, now coach of the Atlanta Falcons, that he doesn't mind taking 
a few extra licks from pass-rushers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pleasant change," Moon said. "There's a more businesslike atmosphere 
here. Jerry was strictly a hands-on coach. Jack is more laid back, more like an 
observer. He lets his assistants run things. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the run-and-shoot makes my job more dangerous. People think 
because I move out of the pocket so much that I'll take more of a beating, but 
that's not true. It depends on how much I throw the football and how good the 
blocking is." 
</P>
<P>
Pardee might never have been converted to the run-and-shoot if it hadn't been 
for an unusual combination of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense plunged from sixth to 27th in the NFL while Pardee was in 
charge, and even the AFC West title they won with a high-powered offense 
couldn't save his job. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee went from the Chargers into private business, but when the short-lived 
United States Football League was founded in 1983, he was named coach of the 
Houston Gamblers. His offensive coordinator was Mouse Davis, who had been using 
the run-and-shoot for years, so he decided to take a flyer on it. Davis now is 
the offensive coordinator of the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Pardee has been in Houston since, but in three different jobs. When 
the USFL folded, he went to the University of Houston, where his Cougars sent 
NCAA offensive records tumbling in every direction. Last season, they averaged 
53.5 points, 511.3 passing yards and 624.9 total yards, all best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Among Houston's nine victories a year ago was a 95-21 humiliation of Forrest 
Gregg's Southern Methodist team, reborn after a two-year death penalty. Gregg 
didn't complain, but Glanville made a nasty deal of it after his Falcons 
defeated Pardee's Oilers, 47-27, in the season opener this year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Glanville: "I'm giving the game ball to Forrest Gregg, because that total 
jerk ran up the score last year. Texas can kiss my butt." 
</P>
<P>
Pardee rarely says a bad thing about anybody, but he made an exception in this 
case: "Glanville always knows what a jerk is." 
</P>
<P>
Pardee has tried to change the Oilers' reputation, picked up under Glanville, 
for taking cheap shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave my players a message the first day," Pardee said. "You can't intimidate 
people in the NFL. If you try, all you do is self-destruct with 15-yard 
penalties."

2 CSUN PLAYERS FACING CHARGES AFTER SCUFFLE 
</P>

Two Cal State Northridge football players will be arraigned Oct. 10 in San 
Fernando Municipal Court in connection with a brawl at an on-campus apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Jackson and Tom Berry were arrested Sept. 14 on suspicion of felony battery 
after an altercation with campus police and security officers outside the 
University Park Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Jackson, 21, a junior from Stockton, allegedly punched Marlin 
Hines, a campus security officer, and pushed Mike Kaufman, a resident dorm 
adviser, in an incident that started when Kaufman asked the two players to stop 
drinking beer in front of the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, 23, from La Palma, also wrestled with Hines and resisted attempts by 
police to break up the altercation, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a 6-foot-4, 245-pound reserve defensive lineman, has been suspended 
from the football team by Northridge Coach Bob Burt. Berry, a 6-4, 260-pound 
senior starter at defensive tackle, remains one of four Northridge team 
captains. He started in the Matadors' 17-6 victory over Central (Okla.) State 
last Saturday and will be in the lineup again Saturday when Northridge plays 
host to UC Davis at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Michael Sugar of the State University Police said an investigation of the 
incident determined that Berry made no attempt to strike Hines while the 
security officer wrestled with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Burt declined comment on the arrests, but sources close to the team say Berry 
was not disciplined because school officials, after interviewing some of the 
witnesses, expect that no charges will be filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson could not be reached for comment and Berry was unavailable, a 
Northridge assistant coach said.

NORTHRIDGE FACULTY HAS SECOND THOUGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
SENATE: CONCERN OVER FUNDING FOR MOVE TO NCAA DIVISION I CITED BY TEACHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The uneasy marriage of academics and athletics at Cal State Northridge took a 
turn for the worse Thursday when the university's faculty senate approved a 
motion expressing concern over the intercollegiate athletic program's move to 
NCAA Division I. 
</P>
<P>
The motion, as presented by math professor David Ostroff, centers on finances. 
The faculty senate believes that the athletic program is receiving funds that 
could be put to better use in instructional programs. 
</P>
<P>
While the motion leaves athletic program officials disappointed, it does not 
constitute an official action. CSUN will stay at Division I in all sports 
except football for at least three years. That is the minimum period required 
by the NCAA after a division change unless the university fails to fulfill the 
obligations of its divisional status. 
</P>
<P>
Just two years ago, the senate unanimously approved the move, but the economic 
climate since has changed dramatically. Like all universities in the Cal State 
system, CSUN's budget was cut this school year, by $6.6 million. As a result, 
the Oviatt and South libraries are closed on Sundays except before final exams, 
fewer classes are being offered and faculty research projects have been 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
During the hourlong discussion several senators gave impassioned pleas about 
spending money on athletics when students are on waiting lists for classes and 
cannot use the library. But CSUN President James W. Cleary assured the senate: 
"Not one red cent of lottery monies goes to athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"There is at least some implication that the athletic department receives more 
funds than it is entitled to," Cleary continued. "That simply is not true. It 
receives the state monies it is entitled to in the formula of the state system. 
In terms of this budget reduction, this department will expect to suffer every 
other cut that other departments are going through." 
</P>
<P>
But Louise Lewis, chairwoman of the Educational Resources Committee, wants to 
be sure that the faculty is carefully monitoring the athletic program's 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to send out a signal that we want to be consulted and involved," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary, however, already has established a watchdog that includes faculty 
members and students. The University Intercollegiate Athletic Oversight Board 
will be in place by Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
It might clear up the misconceptions referred to by by one senator who was 
unsuccessful in his bid to have the motion tabled: "I am amazed by the lack of 
scholarship and research," he said. "I don't think there has been any 
clarification about what this whole thing is about." 
</P>
<P>
For example, several senators expressed concern that the athletic program is 
getting funds from the Cal State Northridge Foundation that should go to 
"instructionally related activities." But the foundation can do what it wants 
with its money. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's board of trustees decides where its money, gained primarily 
from food services and the campus book store, will go. And it comprises six 
faculty members as well as six students and three administrators, including 
Cleary. It not only grants funds to athletics, but it provides funds for 
everything from band uniforms to faculty research projects. 
</P>
<P>
Another sore spot with senators is the full-time equivalent or FTE program with 
regard to the athletic program. The state bases its funding on the number of 
FTEs -- students taking at least 15 academic units. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people (coaches) are not earning their keep as far as FTEs," senate 
faculty member Dr. Jane Bayes said. 
</P>
<P>
She was immediately corrected. Not only do CSUN coaches gain FTEs by teaching 
in the kinesiology and physical education department but by coaching. In the 
Cal State system, participation in a sport is considered a course. 
</P>
<P>
Bayes also said: "It is difficult to believe we are not going Division I in 
football when we are building a stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Cleary said the stadium has been in the works for 20 years and that it is 
needed for commencement exercises, football, soccer and concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The voice of the students at the meeting came from Michelle Cooper, student 
body president. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not an athlete but I still feel athletic programs benefit students. Many 
students who participate might not otherwise be able to attend a university and 
their athletic participation often provides their motivation for academics." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hiegert, CSUN athletic director, was particularly disappointed with the 
senate's motion. 
</P>
<P>
"Emotionally, it is not a very happy afternoon," he said. "A lot of the issues 
discussed in there were on an emotional level. What we do with regard to FTEs 
and meeting the formula of the state is our business. We've had it reviewed by 
the appropriate administrators." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We've had a successful run for 20 years (in Division II). We've 
outlived our mode. Division II does not fit the pattern any more. We started 
this change five to six years ago. We worked through the proper channels." 
</P>
<P>
Hiegert and Cleary also noted that the difference in budget between Division II 
and Division I could not solve CSUN's funding problems.

HILLOCK LOSES ONE COACH, ADDS ANOTHER TO HIS STAFF; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: NEW LOYOLA MARYMOUNT BASKETBALL COACH NAMES MARK ARMSTRONG PART-TIME 
ASSISTANT AFTER CHIEF ASSISTANT JUDAS PRADA JUMPS TO DENVER NUGGETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The complexion of the Loyola Marymount basketball coaching staff continues to 
change as the top assistant has left to join Paul Westhead in the NBA and a 
former Lions player has been added to the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Hillock, who moved up from chief assistant to head coach when Westhead 
jumped to the Denver Nuggets, has added former Loyola forward Mark Armstrong to 
his staff in a part-time position. 
</P>
<P>
He is also looking to fill the position of No. 1 assistant after Judas Prada 
left this week to join Westhead's staff in Denver. Prada was Loyola's 
recruiting coordinator. With practice starting Oct. 15 and the preseason 
signing period approaching in early November, Hillock needs to find a 
replacement quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who has been working in the Loyola admissions office after 
graduating in 1988, was co-captain of the 1987-88 team that won 25 consecutive 
games and finished with a school-record 28-4 record and 14-0 West Coast 
Conference mark. Armstrong, a rugged inside player, ranks third in Loyola 
career rebounds with 825. As a four-year starter, the Riverside native recorded 
single-game highs of 25 points and 19 rebounds, and as a junior he tied for the 
WCC rebounding title, averaging nine per game. 
</P>
<P>
He also set a Lion career record for fouls -- with some justification. At 
6-foot-6, he was the team's most dependable physical player his last two 
seasons. He drew the unenviable task of covering some of the nation's top big 
men, from North Carolina's J. R. Reid and Wyoming's 6-11 Eric Leckner to 
conference foes Levy Middlebrooks at Pepperdine and Mark McCathrion at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's taking a pay cut to move into coaching, Armstrong becomes the 
first paid black basketball coach at Loyola in memory (Jimmy Ellis was a 
volunteer assistant for several years under Westhead). As a player, Armstrong 
was admired for his leadership, maturity and work ethic. The athletic 
department hopes that carries over into coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"He always wanted to try it. I think he'll be a great addition," Hillock said. 
"He's well-liked at the school, the players like him and he can meet some of 
their needs. (The choice) was a natural." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong will work individually with the inside players and will oversee 
weight training. 
</P>
<P>
"He fills several things I was looking for," Hillock said. "I wanted someone 
young, who knew his way around the school and someone who had some feeling for 
the school. . . . He already likes the way it breaks up his schedule, after 
working office jobs for a couple years." 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola women's volleyball team (5-9) travels to San Diego for a 
nonconference match at U.S. International tonight, then opens West Coast 
Conference play Saturday at the University of San Diego. USD (6-8) is off to 
its best start since the WCC started conference play in 1985. However, the 
Lions hold a 9-1 advantage in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Lions captain Kerry House was named to the all-tournament team at the Coors 
Light Invitational in Colorado last week, collecting 74 kills and 35 digs in 
three matches. She is second in the WCC with 4.6 kills per game, and leads with 
five digs per game. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, ranked 14th, was named the favorite to repeat as WCC champ in a 
preseason poll of conference coaches. Loyola was picked sixth. However, the 
Lions have played competitively under first-year Coach Steve Stratos. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jeanna Price broke her week-old Cal State Dominguez Hills record for assists in 
a volleyball match with 59 against Sonoma State. The freshman had 50 in a match 
a week earlier. Freshman teammate Gale Derricott set another Toros record in 
the Sonoma match with 26 kills in 51 attempts. That broke a 3-year-old record 
of 21 set by Houri Garabed. . . . The Dominguez Hills women's soccer team, 
ranked third in the West, has outshot opponents, 129-32, but has only outscored 
them, 8-7. "We've outplayed every team so far. We just can't find the back of 
the net," Toro Coach Marine Cano said. The Lady Toros play host to the 
University of Denver at 3 p.m. Sunday. . . . Martin Mira recorded his 15th 
assist for the Dominguez Hills soccer team, making him the men's career leader. 
The senior out of San Pedro also scored the game-winning goal in a 3-2 victory 
over Grand Canyon College. The Toros play at Cal State San Bernardino at 2 p.m. 
today, then are home to play Sacramento State at 1 p.m. Sunday. . . . Two 
Loyola freshman set course records last weekend in a cross-country meet at 
Pepperdine. Rick Sansing ran 23:41 over 4 1/2 miles for a men's record and Amy 
Harootian set a women's course mark of 20:15 for five kilometers. Both teams 
runs at the UC Riverside Invitational Saturday.

LADY TOROS SEARCH FOR WINNING FORMULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills opens its California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
women's volleyball season Tuesday, days short of a dubious anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros started the week with a 3-6 record and last won a CCAA match on 
Oct. 19, 1987, defeating Cal State Los Angeles, 3-1. Since then, Dominguez 
Hills has lost 30 consecutive league matches. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, despite major improvements made by second-year Coach Nancy Fortner, this 
year's outcome could be a repeat of the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Even Fortner, charged by Athletic Director Dan Guerrero with rebuilding a 
program that was all but dead, admits it will be an uphill struggle. Her goal: 
"I hope that we can take some games off some of these teams this year." 
</P>
<P>
That's games, as in 15 points. Not matches. The NCAA ranked Dominguez Hills 
sixth out of eight teams in the Southwest recently. Ahead of the Lady Toros 
were the other five CCAA teams, including top-rated Riverside, which plays host 
to Dominguez Hills on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This is a school that considers it a victory to win a game or two. In CCAA 
play, Dominguez Hills won only one game last year and that came against Cal 
State L.A., which, according to Fortner "has improved a lot this season over 
last." 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros have shown promise in two tournaments, however, taking single 
games from defending national champion Bakersfield and Cal Poly Pomona, ranked 
second in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a new attitude here," Fortner said. "Things are more positive, the 
kids are stronger and they come from good, strong club backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
The near demise of volleyball at Dominguez Hills has been especially painful 
for Fortner. In 1978, she coached the Lady Toros to their only conference 
title. But a year later, after a 13-14 record, she became the coach at Loyola 
Marymount. In 1986 the Lady Lions were champions of the West Coast Athletic 
Conference and opened the playoffs with an upset victory over powerhouse UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Then Fortner, frustrated that Loyola would not give her a full-time teaching 
position, walked away from volleyball altogether. She worked odd jobs and drove 
a bus for a retirement home. When Coach Jennifer Gorecki resigned at Dominguez 
Hills in 1988, Fortner returned to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
In Fortner's absence, however, Dominguez Hills struggled. It has had only one 
winning season since she left in 1979, a 15-14 mark in 1984. Going back to 
1986, the team has lost 35 of 36 CCAA matches. You can count the number of 
games the team has won on a single hand. 
</P>
<P>
Down the line, however, Guerrero sees improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"In two or three years, Nancy will have done the things necessary to make this 
program more competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner, hired in July of 1989, had no time to recruit players for last year's 
team, so she took what she could get -- leftovers from a pair of teams that 
lost 53 matches and some walk-on freshmen. Although Dominguez Hills was 7-22 
overall, the number of victories was better than either of the two previous 
seasons. A total of 23 team or individual records were broken in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Quite an accomplishment, points out Guerrero, for a team that was basically 
thrown together. 
</P>
<P>
However, sports information director Kevin Gilmore adds: "If you look at most 
of our records against the records of other schools, our records don't even 
come close." 
</P>
<P>
Discrepancies in performances point out that even the best efforts in things 
like kills, digs and aces at Dominguez Hills fall short of those of other 
players in the CCAA. For example, the school record for most kills in a season 
is only 205, an average of only four per match, although it has stood since 
1983. The season record at Pomona, a middle-echelon team, is 486. The Dominguez 
Hills record for blocked kills is 28. At Pomona it is 124. 
</P>
<P>
Three marks have already been set this season and Fortner said more are on the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman setter Jeanna Price of Lake Elsinore has broken the school set assist 
record twice. Sophomore hitter Gale Derricott of Riverside recently broke the 
school record for match kills. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeanna has a good work ethic. She has helped us get rid of that (losing) 
attitude from the past," Fortner said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fortner, Derricott could develop into one of the top Division II 
players in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Her club team folded so she didn't get a lot of recognition," Fortner said. 
"My timing in signing her was right. She was just overlooked by everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore hitter Angela Hamer, who missed most of last season after she was 
injured in an auto accident, is the heart and soul of the team, according to 
Fortner. 
</P>
<P>
"She has good fighting spirit," Fortner said. "She's not afraid to attack or go 
after any ball. She's our team leader." 
</P>
<P>
Also playing well is sophomore Lourdes Estrada of Wilmington, a utility player 
last season who has moved into the starting mid-hitter spot. 
</P>
<P>
Six-foot Julie Berthiaume, who holds the school record for most blocked solos 
in a match (5), is the only senior on the team. She has been rotated with 
defensive specialist Michele Newman, a junior transfer from El Camino College. 
Melissa Lynch, a junior transfer from Cerritos College, has started most of the 
year at a hitter position. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fortner: "Realistically, we won't be on top this year . . . But I hope 
that in the next three or four years that at least we will be in the middle, 
rather than on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero is confident that will be the case. Anything Fortner does will be an 
improvement over past performances, he said.

Cleveland 14, Monroe 14 -- Cleveland quarterback Delvon McDaniel was stopped on 
the Monroe four-yard line as time expired in the game at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, a running back who replaced injured David Erhardt (suspected 
hip-pointer) at the start of the third quarter, guided the Cavaliers to one 
score at quarterback -- a two-yard plunge by Manny Valencia that tied the 
score, 14-14, midway through the third quarter.

BIG SECOND HALF SPARKS WIN FOR THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>

<P>
If Thousand Oaks High had not pulled itself out of the funk that plagued the 
team in the first half, the Lancers could have easily lost their Marmonte 
League opener at Newbury Park on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Thousand Oaks, which rushed for only 51 yards in the first half, used some 
big plays in the third quarter to claim a 21-0 victory over the Panthers (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (3-1) seemed like a recharged team in the second half, rushing for 
182 yards after intermission. On the fifth play after the second-half kickoff, 
quarterback Scott Peterson faked a handoff to tailback Cory Bowen and streaked 
down the Newbury Park sideline for a 47-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny O'Connor's 30-yard punt return put the Lancers on the Newbury Park 35 to 
start their next possession. On the first play from scrimmage, the offensive 
line opened a huge hold on the right side for Greg Buchanan, who raced 35 yards 
to give the Lancers a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan finished with 121 yards in 16 carries, Bowen gained 46 yards in 12 
carries and Peterson completed five of eight passes for 55 yards and one 
touchdown. He was also sacked six times for minus 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks scored its first touchdown in the opening period on Peterson's 
12-yard pass to Jason Ybarra, who was all alone in the end zone. Ybarra's score 
capped a 10-play, 48-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
But that score was all the Lancers would get in the first half. In the second 
quarter, Peterson fumbled at Newbury Park's 30 as Jon Atherton was about to 
sack him for an eight-yard loss. Newbury Park's Dave Henderson fell on the 
loose ball, and Newbury Park then started on its most impressive drive of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Panther quarterback Zack Sutton completed three passes to wide receiver Jason 
Smith for 10, 13, and 19 yards to make up most of the yardage. But then the 
Lancers' secondary tightened its coverage. After the Panthers reached the 
Thousand Oaks' nine-yard line, Sutton threw four incomplete passes to end the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
The Newbury Park drive made for a tense Thousand Oaks sideline. Lancers' Coach 
Bob Richards, for one, was a little more than worried. 
</P>
<P>
"On a scale of 1 to 10, a 10," Richards said in reference to his worry 
quotient. "They had totally taken control of the game at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park's Smith caught five passes for 71 yards to lead the offensive 
attack.

Mission Viejo, ranked eighth in Orange County, had little trouble defeating 
host Crawford High School Thursday night at Madison High in front of 300 fans. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos (3-1) scored a 39-0 nonleague victory over the Colts (1-3) behind 
the two touchdowns apiece scored by Beau LeBreton and Marcellus Chrishon. 
</P>
<P>
LeBreton was the game's early hero, rushing eight yards for a touchdown on 
Mission Viejo's first drive, a 60-yard, 10-play effort. 
</P>
<P>
LeBreton found himself in the end zone seconds later on defense. He stripped 
the ball from Crawford quarterback Phil Parker, then picked it up and scored 
from 16 yards on the fumble recovery to make it 12-0. Both PAT attempts failed. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who also played strong safety, was injured while breaking up a pass 
play and the game was delayed 27 minutes. He was taken to Sharp Memorial 
Hospital, where he was to be observed overnight. 
</P>
<P>
After Parker's departure, Diablo quarterback Tim Snowden completed passes of 
21, 14 and 27 yards before Chrishon carried the ball into the end zone from the 
one. Doug Roberson's kick made it 19-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon scored again from one yard late in the third quarter to make it 25-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos finished the scoring in the fourth. Erick Fielding scored from 18 
yards and Payson LeMeilleur scored from one on a quarterback sneak.

Orange County will be included before year's end. The data comes from the

<P>
Four days ago, the Aztecs announced that Curtis Butts would miss Saturday's 
game against Air Force because of a neck strain. 
</P>
<P>
Now, apparently, he will start. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's healthy, he'll probably start," Aztec Coach Al Luginbill said. And 
according to trainer Brian Barry, Butts is ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Tommy Booker, who has been out with an ankle injury since the Cal 
State Long Beach game two weeks ago, has also been cleared to play. But 
Luginbill said he might hold out Booker. "If he's not 100%, he won't play. We 
don't want to take any chances." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Luginbill said Larry Maxey will see some time at running back. 
Maxey was moved from H-back this week because of the injuries to Butts and 
Booker. 
</P>
<P>
After he called Wednesday's defensive practice one of the worst of the year, 
Luginbill said Thursday's was the best. "I've been waiting for that. We were 
flying around on defense all day. That's the way you have to play against a 
team (Air Force) that runs the option. . . . Luginbill named Dennis Arey, 
Patrick Rowe and Jimmy Raye as his starters at receiver and Jake Nyberg as the 
backup. He said Keith Williams, Merton Harris and Will Tate will also probably 
play. Receiver coach Curtis Johnson said he hopes his receivers can hang on to 
the ball this week. "Most of the people who were dropping the ball are young," 
he said. "The main thing is to get the kids' confidence back. Because if one of 
the older guys get hurt, they're going to have to get in there." DAVE McKIBBEN

SURROGATE TOLD TO STOP DAILY VISITS; 
</P>
<P>
RULING: A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE LIMITS ANNA L. JOHNSON'S VISITS WITH HER BIRTH 
BABY AFTER FINDING THAT HER PRESENCE IN THE CALVERT HOUSEHOLD CAUSED TENSION.

Surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson lost the right Thursday to daily visits with 
the baby she bore for an infertile couple after a judge found that the tension 
during visits to the couple's home was harmful to the infant. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. also said that Mark and Crispina 
Calvert, the couple who hired Johnson for $10,000 to carry their embryo, could 
keep the little boy until another hearing in the landmark case on Oct. 9. 
Johnson may continue her monitored visits to their home, but the judge limited 
the visits to twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord willing, this is the beginning of the end," Mark Calvert said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawyer, Richard C. Gilbert, who had pledged to ask the state appeals 
court to place the baby with Johnson, said Thursday he would wait instead for 
the outcome of the next hearing. Johnson has been visiting the baby daily since 
Saturday, the day after she agreed the infant could stay temporarily with the 
Calverts. 
</P>
<P>
Parslow reduced the number of visits Thursday after the baby's court-appointed 
guardian, William G. Steiner, testified that the child would be better off if 
Johnson did not visit every day because of the strained relations between 
Johnson and the Calverts. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the tensions in the household are being transferred to the baby," 
Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner, executive director of a foundation that raises money to help abused 
and neglected children, said that he believes Johnson "does feel a special 
relationship with this child and that relationship has to be recognized and 
understood." But for the time being, he said, the stress created by her visits 
must be minimized for the sake of the child, who was born on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys in the case are already looking to the Oct. 9 hearing as pivotal in 
the unique test-tube triangle dispute. That is when Parslow will be asked to 
step into uncharted legal waters and decide who the baby's legal parents are. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, backed out of the surrogate birth contract, claiming that the 
Calverts neglected her during pregnancy. She is the first surrogate mother to 
seek custody of a child who has no genetic relationship to her. In the famed 
Baby M case, the birth mother's own egg was inseminated, so she was 
biologically related to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
When Parslow took the bench Thursday, he summarized the Johnson-Calvert case 
briefly, noting that this child has "arguably, three parents," since the birth 
mother and the genetic mother are not the same woman.

Gilbert took that as an encouraging sign. He has argued that Johnson has 
parental rights over the child simply by virtue of carrying and delivering him. 
The Calverts contend that they are the only ones who can legally call 
themselves parents, since Johnson provided no genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
Christian R. Van Deusen, one of the Calverts' lawyers, said that if Johnson is 
held to be a legal parent, it would be difficult to decide the scope of her 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that mean she gets visits? Does she get constant input in the child's 
life? Does it mean she is just entitled to periodic reports, like, 'Hi, he's 
doing fine, he's playing Little League?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harold F. LaFlamme, the baby's court-appointed lawyer, said even more profound 
civil rights questions would be broached if the judge rules that all three 
adults have parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very concerned with the rights of the birth mother during pregnancy, as 
well as those of the genetic parents after the birth," he said. "Would it mean 
that the genetic parents get to dictate what a surrogate mother eats and drinks 
during pregnancy, or whether she takes drugs, or if she can travel? What if she 
wants an abortion? Would they have the power to stop her?" 
</P>
<P>
LaFlamme wondered aloud if a three-parent ruling would mean that the surrogate 
mother could wield intrusive power over the lives of the genetic parents, 
demanding a role in such decisions as where they live, whether the child is 
circumcised or whether he attends private school. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world will be looking to see if you can bifurcate motherhood," 
LaFlamme said. "The question comes down to this: Is providing the genetic 
material enough to confer motherhood on someone, or is carrying and delivering 
a child enough to confer it, or both, meaning that the child has two mothers?" 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert put it simply: 
</P>
<P>
"The judge can look reality squarely in the face and recognize that this child 
has three biological parents, or he can turn his head." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said that Johnson is confident that "the day will come" when she is 
recognized as the infant's mother, either through a court ruling or through 
legislation she hopes will be enacted in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner advocated a quick resolution to the dispute. He said that on Saturday 
night, the first night the baby spent with the Calverts, Crispina Calvert 
"slept next to the baby with her hand on his back." He said that kind of 
uncertainty and stress must be ended to create a secure environment for the 
infant.

VICTIM REPORTED IN GOOD SPIRITS; 
</P>
<P>
ASSAULT: NEWPORT HARBOR HIGH GRADUATE IS DAUGHTER OF A FORMER SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA BANK EXECUTIVE.

A 1986 graduate of Newport Harbor High School was reported to be in good 
spirits Thursday night after being wounded by a psychotic gunman near the UC 
Berkeley campus. 
</P>
<P>
Karen A. Grundhofer, 22, the daughter of former Southern California bank 
executive John F. Grundhofer, was among the six people injured when 30-year-old 
Mehrdad Dashti stormed the Durant Hotel bar and opened fire, killing one 
student. 
</P>
<P>
Dashti, who was shot and killed by a SWAT team, took more than 33 hostages 
during a seven-hour standoff with police. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Raway, a spokeswoman for Grundhofer's father, now president and chief 
executive officer of First Bank System in Minneapolis, said Karen Grundhofer 
was able to speak with her father, who flew to California on Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Grundhofer, a UC Berkeley student majoring in sociology, was initially 
treated at Highland General Hospital in Oakland for a wound reportedly suffered 
when a bullet grazed her head. She was transferred to Pacific Presbyterian 
Medical Center in San Francisco about 3:30 p.m. Hospital officials said she was 
listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Raway said Karen Grundhofer apparently had suffered seven separate wounds but 
that none appeared to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Presbyterian spokeswoman said Grundhofer was able to talk with family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Jacqueline Evans, 23, Grundhofer's former roommate at UC Berkeley and a 
schoolmate at Newport Harbor High School, said she learned that her friend was 
"talking, laughing and showing people her bullet wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who graduated from UC Berkeley last May, said Grundhofer worked at the 
Durant Hotel as a desk clerk. She said the hotel's bar was a favorite meeting 
place for Grundhofer and her friends. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said Grundhofer was planning to graduate next spring and pursue a career 
in hotel management. In between semesters, Evans said, Grundhofer continued to 
live in Newport Beach with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just so crazy that this happened," Evans said. "She's really a strong 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Former Newport Harbor High School Principal Tom Jacobson described Grundhofer 
as the "center of a lot of social activity at the school." 
</P>
<P>
"She was probably one of the most outgoing personalties on campus," Jacobson 
said. "The kids gave her a nickname, 'Grundo,' which was meant in a positive 
light. You would hear that nickname shouted across campus. I used to tease her 
because she drove a brand-new blue Ford Bronco. I teased her because it was 
better than the car I drove." 
</P>
<P>
"She is one of those kids who has personality-plus," Jacobson said. "She was 
one of those students who truly enjoyed school." 
</P>
<P>
During her high school years, Grundhofer was involved with the girl's high 
school soccer team. She was also among the debutantes at a 1986 Children's Home 
Society ball. 
</P>
<P>
Her father was Wells Fargo Bank's top executive in Southern California before 
resigning last February to head the First Bank System. He also served as 
chairman of the Southern California United States Olympic Committee.

Mayor Marion Barry, bowing to a chief demand of students occupying two 
buildings at the University of the District of Columbia, said he will ask 10 of 
the school's 15 trustees to resign. However, the mayor added that he is 
powerless to force anyone on the trustee board to quit. "We had a good 
dialogue, a good session," the mayor said after emerging from a 4 1/2-hour 
meeting with students who have occupied the two buildings at the city-run 
university since Wednesday.

South Korea and China will sign an accord next month to exchange trade offices 
in each other's capital, a Seoul newspaper said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Joong-ang Daily News said the two nations have resolved differences over 
the functions of such offices and agreed to swap them in October. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the offices will be set up on a private basis but handle 
limited consular affairs. Seoul has been trying for years to open formal ties 
with China but its efforts have failed largely because of pressure from 
Communist North Korea.

U.S. AGENCY TO INVESTIGATE UNSCHEDULED FLIGHT STOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Transportation said Thursday that it will look into 
complaints that two airlines serving John Wayne Airport are not notifying 
passengers in a timely fashion of unscheduled refueling stops at Ontario 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are representing to the public at the time the ticket is purchased 
that the flight is a nonstop but it's really via Ontario, then they're doing 
something wrong," said Hoyt Decker, the department's assistant director of 
consumer affairs. "We certainly want to take a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of unscheduled refueling stops in Ontario surfaced earlier this week 
when Alaska Airlines officials confirmed that their jetliners had made about 12 
such stops in the past two weeks because the air carrier is in danger of 
surpassing John Wayne's noise limits. Trans World Airlines has since 
acknowledged that it has been making unscheduled refueling stops three to four 
times a week in Ontario for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
Noise restrictions at John Wayne, among the nation's toughest, require that 
airlines stay below specific quarterly noise averages as measured at various 
stations around the airport. Reducing weight by taking on fuel elsewhere allows 
planes to gain altitude faster and thus make a quieter exit from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Decker said his primary concern is not the stopovers themselves, but rather 
advance notice to passengers at time of ticket purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"The passenger is entitled to enough advance warning to be able to make a 
decision whether to board that airplane or make other arrangements," Decker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said 12 unscheduled refueling stops in a two-week period do not necessarily 
constitute a pattern of deceptive or unfair competition, but warrants 
attention. If the Department of Transportation finds that an airline is 
engaging in unfair or deceptive business practices, his department could issue 
a cease-and-desist order. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers have complained about the unscheduled stops and the resulting 
delays. TWA passengers say they have missed connecting flights at TWA's hub in 
St. Louis, Mo., as a result of the Ontario stop. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Airlines officials have acknowledged that it wasn't until this week that 
they began a telephone campaign to notify passengers of the Ontario refueling 
stops, which add 20 to 40 minutes to each flight. But they said the extra stop 
will be eliminated when a new period for measuring airport noise begins on Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
TWA spokesman Jim Faulkner said Thursday that there is no Department of 
Transportation rule that requires airlines to notify passengers of such stops 
within any particular time. 
</P>
<P>
"If we know well beforehand, we will notify the passengers ahead of time," 
Faulkner said. "But often we find that passengers have already boarded the 
plane before we know that we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Fuel, weather and weight are not computed until just before flight time, he 
said, adding that fueling occurs at John Wayne even as passengers strap 
themselves in their seats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure if it's becoming a pattern we'll abide by whatever the DOT rules," 
Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the airline will try to hold a specific connecting flight at St. Louis 
if many passengers aboard a John Wayne flight are scheduled to be on it. But 
Faulkner also acknowledged that the airline is not likely to do that for a 
single passenger or maybe even a small number. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for TWA and Alaska said they believe that passengers would prefer to 
stop for fuel than be bumped from a John Wayne flight altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The unscheduled refueling stops have always been one of several strategies 
available to airlines for meeting John Wayne Airport's noise limits. Most air 
carriers, however, have chosen to restrict seat sales or bump passengers if 
necessary in order to stay within the airport's regulations.

STUDENT TRUSTEES COACHED ON POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who attend school board meetings on a regular basis are familiar with 
the panel of student representatives who sit in front of the trustees. In some 
districts they cast straw votes alongside their adult counterparts; in others, 
the students just watch the proceedings and occasionally voice opinions during 
designated sections of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, more than 30 high school juniors and seniors who sit on district 
school boards throughout Southern California gathered at Woodbridge High School 
for a daylong symposium. The topic on many of their minds was how to get the 
adults to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in education get so caught up in their jobs, in doing what 
they see as their jobs, that they lose sight of the people they're doing it 
for, the students," said Rebecca Toth, a member of the California Assn. of 
Student Councils, which sponsored the program. "The main goal of the program is 
to get students to be able to actually do something on the school boards." 
</P>
<P>
Another student, Jeff Melo of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, 
said he has found that adults aren't usually prepared to take action on 
students' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the power, but the people who do have it aren't listening," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium included seminars on time organization and effective 
presentations. But Toth said the most important lessons were on how to deal 
with school board politics and how students can use their positions to advance 
the concerns of their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them said that their principals don't want them to talk about issues 
that will rock the boat," Toth said. "So we suggest that they get together with 
some of the board members on a one-to-one basis and talk about what they feel 
are imminent concerns." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, diplomacy with the elected members is often the best way to get 
something done, said Maureen DeMarco, president of the California Assn. of 
Student Councils and a speaker at the symposium. And, she said, getting more 
students interested in important issues helps, too. LAURA MICHAELIS

COMIC DRAWS FIRE OF AIDS PROTESTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
About 25 protesters from an AIDS coalition smashed watermelons in front of the 
Coach House concert club Wednesday night as comedian Gallagher was preparing to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
The protest, sponsored by ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) Orange 
County, was in response to a recent show at Lake Tahoe at which Gallagher 
included an AIDS joke in his act. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is not funny," screamed protest organizer Jan Speller as concert-goers 
were driving into the club parking lot. "We're here to express our outrage of 
Gallagher's recent statements. We're not about to sit back and let these 
comments go by." 
</P>
<P>
"It's particularly painful," said protester Joseph Amster, "considering that 
this week marked the passing of Orange County's 1,000th AIDS death." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher -- who uses sledgehammers to smash, pulverize and spray his audience 
with watermelons and other food items -- would not comment directly. But a 
Coach House official released a statement from Gary Proper, the comedian's 
manager. "The Lake Tahoe AIDS reference was an isolated event," said the 
statement. "It was a one-time event. Gallagher has and will never include 
material about AIDS again." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher ends a six-night stand at the Coach House on Saturday night. 
</P>

Costa Mesa, where comedian Andrew Dice Clay was performing. ERIK HAMILTON

FIRE IN MALL'S ATTIC IS SWIFTLY EXTINGUISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A blaze broke out in an attic at a small mall Thursday afternoon but was 
quickly extinguished when a sprinkler system put out the flames. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which was sparked by faulty electrical wires, caused about $35,000 
worth of damage, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were alerted to the blaze about 2 p.m. by employees of EJG 
Clothing Corp. The fire forced evacuation of four stores in the refurbished 
packing house in the 18000 block of Yorba Linda Boulevard, Orange County Fire 
Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the 17 firefighters arrived, the building's sprinkler system had 
doused most of the flames.

NEW LIFE PROJECT BUILDS SELF-ESTEEM

Carlos Lemus was living on the streets just 11 months ago, so he knows how much 
the backpacks loaded with pens, pencils, paper and glue will mean when they are 
given out to poor and homeless children at the Orange County Rescue Mission. 
</P>
<P>
"This area is drug-infested and many people have children living below the 
poverty level," said Lemus, a member of the mission's New Life rehabilitation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"It will give the children something to look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 New Life participants stuffed 150 backpacks donated by local 
businesses in preparation for a giveaway scheduled Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 
p.m. at the mission. The children will also be given inflatable "water wings." 
</P>
<P>
New Life members, who live at the mission for one year before taking a 
full-time job or entering school, help out with projects to gain self-esteem 
before re-entering mainstream life, said Jim Palmer, project coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have gone through a lot and helping someone else kind of puts 
things in perspective. Since many of them have recently come off the streets 
themselves, they're more understanding and sensitive to the people who come for 
help," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Lemus, who will graduate from the New Life program next month, said he felt 
good about the project because as a former homeless man, he has rarely had a 
chance to help others. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could give someone $100 for a worthy purpose, I'd feel good," he said. 
"But I'm not in a position to do that. I'm still trying to get my life back 
together." CHERYLANNE BEALER

D.A.'S OFFICE DISCUSSES POLL GUARD CASE WITH CRITICS 
</P>

In an attempt to cool tempers, Orange County district attorney officials met 
Thursday with community leaders upset about a lack of progress in the criminal 
investigation of Republican Party officials who placed uniformed guards at 
polling places in the 1988 general election. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Americans for Constitutional Justice, a group that has been 
picketing the district attorney's office and demanding criminal charges in the 
case, called the meeting positive but added that this type of communication 
should have been offered long ago. 
</P>
<P>
With no official comment in nearly two years, members of the group had 
questioned whether any investigation was under way and suspected that political 
bias was behind the long delay. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue of major public concern and I think they had an obligation to 
communicate with the public," said Paul Garza, former executive director of the 
Orange County Democratic Party and a member of the community group. "This 
particular crime had a major public impact. . . . I don't think they realize 
how important this is." 
</P>
<P>
Rueben Martinez, head of the group, added, "Where there's a lack of 
communication, more rumors begin. There's a lot of people saying that no 
charges are going to be filed because they're Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
Americans for Constitutional Justice, which includes several Democratic and 
Latino leaders, has called on Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi to withdraw from 
the case because his office is investigating some of the same Republican Party 
officials who are helping with his Nov. 6 reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi denied there is a conflict of interest because he is not directly 
involved in the case, which is being investigated by his assistant, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Wallace Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said Thursday he invited the community leaders to discuss the 
investigation in hopes of clearing up misunderstandings about its progress. He 
told them the county investigation has been completed and the findings turned 
over to the U.S. Justice Department in Washington for a review to determine 
whether charges are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
About communicating with the community, Wade said: "I suppose if we had a staff 
that was doing that it would be great. The media bears some of the 
responsibility. Our primary responsibility is to the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The poll guard case stems from a decision in November, 1988, by Republican 
Party leaders and officials from the campaign of Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove) to place 20 uniformed guards at polling places in 
predominantly Latino neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Republican officials said they acted on a rumor that Pringle's then-Democratic 
opponent, Christian R. (Rick) Thierbach, was planning to bring in busloads of 
illegal voters. Democrats charge, however, that the intent of the guards was to 
intimidate Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the meeting Thursday added they were frustrated by a recent 
letter from the Justice Department that indicated the federal government may 
not have jurisdiction since the case involved a state Assembly race, not a 
federal office. 
</P>
<P>
There were federal candidates on the ballot, but Justice Department spokesman 
Doug Tillett said Thursday the law is based on the intent of the perpetrator. 
</P>
<P>
"If the intent was to interfere with a federal election, that would have been a 
different circumstance," he said. "My understanding is that the intent was to 
distract voters in a local race." 
</P>
<P>
Wade said there are also allegations that state voter intimidation laws were 
violated, and that is still being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
While Thursday's meeting was considered helpful by both sides, Martinez said he 
expects the pickets will continue.

SECURITY STUDIED AS YOUTH ESCAPES CUSTODY 2ND TIME

A day after the second escape in as many months by the same youth, authorities 
at County Juvenile Hall on Thursday launched a review of security at the 
detention facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing an internal review to look at the circumstances of the escape," 
said Rod Speer, a spokesman for the Orange County Probation Department, which 
helps administer Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Neale, 18, of Los Alamitos and Baldomero Diaz, 17, broke out at 7:45 p.m. 
Wednesday by scaling one 16-foot chain link fence and crawling under a loose 
section of another, said Mack Jenkins, the facility's assistant director. Diaz 
was awaiting sentencing for attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
They were last seen wearing the facility-issued dark blue T-shirts and sweat 
pants as they ran from the facility toward the Santa Ana River Trail, Sheriff's 
Lt. Jay Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
Neale, who was waiting a transfer to a California Youth Authority center in 
Norwalk, had escaped Aug. 17, but was quickly recaptured, Speer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been in Juvenile Hall repeatedly for numerous sentences over a period 
of years," Speer said, but he declined to say why. 
</P>
<P>
Neale is described as 5 feet, 8 inches tall, weighing about 160 pounds with 
short-cropped red hair and hazel eyes. Diaz is described as 5-foot-9, about 150 
pounds with black hair and brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Speer said that the department has alerted sheriff's officers and other police 
agencies in the county. Authorities are especially anxious to find Diaz, who is 
considered more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Speer encouraged anyone with possible information leading to the recapture of 
the fugitives to call the Sheriff's Department at (714) 647-7000 or a local 
police agency.

owners who bought the team last year.

George W. Bush, managing general partner of the Rangers, said General Manager 
Tom Grieve and Manager Bobby Valentine, both hired by Stone, should not fear

NEXT GAME CURTAILS HUSKY CELEBRATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Washington fans still are ecstatic about the Huskies' 31-0 victory over USC 
last Saturday in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
A sign over a Seattle restaurant reads: "Go Huskies. Can You Smell the Roses?" 
</P>
<P>
That may be premature because it's only September. However, the Pacific 10 
schedule certainly favors Washington. The Huskies will play their conference 
games against Oregon, California, Arizona and UCLA at home. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the fans, Coach Don James and his players aren't spending much time 
savoring the win over USC. The Huskies will play Colorado Saturday in Boulder, 
Colo., and the team is mindful of last year's game, which the Buffaloes won, 
45-28, in Seattle while gaining 420 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most points scored against a James-coached team at Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"People might think we're still riding high on USC this week," Washington 
linebacker Brett Collins said. "However, we know the importance of our next 
game. If we didn't, all we have to do is look at the film of last year . . . 
420 yards rushing." 
</P>
<P>
In referring to last season's game against Colorado, James said: "We were taken 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
Washington seems better prepared to stop Colorado's ground-oriented offense. 
The Huskies lead the nation in rushing defense, having allowed three opponents 
an average of only 23.3 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
James, while elated by his team's runaway victory over USC, also seemed a bit 
mystified. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my wildest imagination did I think we could take them apart as we 
did," James said of the Trojans. "I thought we could win the game, but I didn't 
think it would be the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dick Tomey of Arizona is already promoting one of his players, cornerback 
Darryl Lewis, for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's best defensive 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Against Oregon last Saturday night in Tucson, Lewis, from Nogales High School 
in La Puente: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Returned a punt 65 yards to a touchdown that was nullified by a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Intercepted a pass by Bill Musgrave and ran 41 yards to set up a field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Returned a second interception -- his fourth of the season -- 52 yards to a 
touchdown that put the Wildcats ahead, 19-14. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Made a game-saving tackle on Musgrave a few inches from the goal line with 
nine seconds remaining to preserve the Wildcats' 22-17 victory over the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just thinking, 'Go get him, one on one,' " Lewis said of his stop on 
Musgrave. "He lowered his shoulder and was just coming and he was trying to get 
across, and I did my best to get him and stop him and I did." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is 5 feet 9 and 186 pounds. Musgrave is 6-3 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it would seem that California (1-2) is overmatched for its game 
against Arizona (3-0) Saturday in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
However, it has been a strange series. The Bears have a 5-4-2 edge, with eight 
of the previous 11 games decided by seven or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the visiting team seems to have an advantage. In games at Tucson, Cal 
is 4-2; at Berkeley, Arizona is 2-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Bears overcame deficits of 21-0 and 28-10 to win, 29-28, at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
California will have to improve defensively, though, to be competitive against 
Arizona. The Bears are last in the conference in total defense, having allowed 
an average of 463.3 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Futility is the theme of Oregon State's season. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Stanford defeated the Beavers, 37-3, last Saturday in Palo Alto, 
leaving them winless in four games, with Nebraska next at Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
How bad were the Beavers against the Cardinal? Said Coach Dave Kragthorpe: "We 
were awfully soft, slow and lethargic in the first half (as Stanford took a 
31-0 lead)," Kragthorpe said. "We never did stop any given play. No offense, no 
first downs."

TUSTIN TEAMMATES LEARNED TO PLAY TOGETHER -- AND WIN TOGETHER;

PREP FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACKS ANCICH AND GOODS, WHO FIRST PUT ON THE PADS IN 
EIGHTH GRADE, HAVE LEDTILLERS TO 3-0 RECORD.

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visko Ancich's love for football can be traced to the most exciting game in 
Angelus League history. Ron Goods' affection for the sport took root from 
neighborhood friends, including an offensive lineman named Visko Ancich, who 
urged him to play. 
</P>
<P>
Their first meeting in pads was as eighth-graders playing Junior All-American 
football. Ancich was a sturdy guard. Goods was a speedy running back. Neither 
had played organized football before and both struggled to learn the ins and 
outs of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Now seniors, they form Tustin High School's starting backfield, one of the best 
in Orange County. Ancich, running inside, and Goods, running outside, have led 
Tustin to a 3-0 record, a No. 1 ranking in the Southern Section Division VI and 
the No. 3 spot in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Tustin tries for its fourth consecutive victory when it plays host to 
El Modena at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Goods is the Tillers' leading rusher with 281 yards in 45 carries, a 6.2 
average. Ancich has gained 158 yards in 42 carries and scored five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich, 5 feet 9, 182 pounds, is still the sturdy one. Goods, 5-10, 188, is 
still the faster runner despite a nagging hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They really complement each other," said Marijon Ancich, Tustin coach and 
Visko's father. "We don't know how fast Ron is because of his hamstring. He's 
been coasting and running 4.6 (seconds for the 40-yard dash)." 
</P>
<P>
Of his son, Ancich said: "I just felt he was going to live up to the standards 
of life. I knew he would always find some way to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Both backs have played on the varsity for the past three seasons and Ancich 
said their experience is one of the main reasons the Tillers are 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get a tie on the blocks, those guys are smart enough to go the right 
way," Ancich said. "This is by far the most experienced backfield we've had. 
That makes a big difference. Probably 90% of high school coaching headaches are 
getting guys to run the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Visko Ancich was always sure the direction he would take once he entered high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of accepted," he said. "I never really questioned it." 
</P>
<P>
After all, his father was one of the most successful coaches in the Southern 
Section when he was growing up. Marijon coached at St. Paul in Santa Fe Springs 
from 1961 to 1981, and was an assistant at Northern Arizona in 1982 and at 
Cerritos College in 1983 before moving to Tustin in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
At St. Paul, Ancich's coaching took on near-legendary status. He was 188-31-5 
in 19 seasons. The Swordsmen reached the Southern Section playoffs 14 
consecutive seasons during that time for a Southern Section record. 
</P>
<P>
He lived in the working-class city of San Pedro, adding to his, and St. Paul's, 
rough-and-tumble image. Visko and his younger brother, Dusan, a sophomore 
linebacker and offensive lineman, grew up surrounded by football. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had a piece of paper lying around, he'll start drawing plays on it," 
Visko said of his father. "Essays, newspapers -- they turn up everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
One game -- a St. Paul vs. Bishop Amat contest in 1981 -- still stands out in 
Visko's mind. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 14-14, but in those days, Angelus League games went to 
California tiebreakers. Visko, along with several thousand others, spilled out 
of the stands to get a better view. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 11:15 p.m., St. Paul pulled out a thrilling, 42-35 victory and went 
on to win the Big Five Conference championship with a 14-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really emotional," Visko said. "Half the field was covered with fans. I 
didn't really understand the game, but that was my first real memory of 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the Ancich family moved to Tustin. Visko met Goods, and 
knocked other kids out of the way so Goods could run with the football. 
</P>
<P>
Goods was always faster, but doesn't consider himself fast. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself with average speed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing that, Ancich said, "What does that make me, a slug?" 
</P>
<P>
Goods would feel better if his hamstring felt better. He spends time before 
practice treating it with a heating pad. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Goods felt his hamstring pull while running the 100 meters in a 
track and field meet. Doctors told him he had a muscle imbalance. His 
quadriceps was stronger than his hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
It was another in a frustrating series of injuries for Goods. Last season, he 
separated his left and right shoulders and played only on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
His shoulders are in good shape and the hamstring is coming along. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be OK," Goods said. "They're going to have to drag me off the field 
this year."

Nearly 18 months after federal regulators seized Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, 
the thrift is continuing to lose big bucks. In the second quarter, the 
insolvent thrift posted a second-quarter net loss of $163.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, revealed in a quarterly report thrift regulators released Thursday, 
puts the S&amp;L's loss at $327.3 million for the first six months this year 
ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Since federal regulators seized the thrift in April, 1989, Lincoln has reported 
losses of $1.3 billion, most of it attributed to write-downs they say prior 
owners should have made. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's deteriorating condition raises questions about how much its failure 
may ultimately cost taxpayers and why the government has been unable to sell, 
close or otherwise resolve problems of the troubled institution. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators, who refused to comment Thursday, have said the thrift's collapse 
will cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion, making it one of the most 
expensive thrift failures ever. Its collapse has been attributed to risky junk 
bond investments and real estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
The failure has prompted numerous criminal investigations and civil lawsuits. 
Charles H. Keating Jr., former chairman of American Continental Corp., 
Lincoln's parent company, was indicted last week on 42 counts of securities 
fraud stemming from the thrift's failure. He is being held on $5-million bail 
in Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly report shows that Lincoln, whose 29 branches are still open, is 
paying $50 million more to cover deposit rates than it collects from the rates 
it charges on its loans. In addition, regulators have listed $924 million in 
mainly construction and land loans as slow-paying, overdue loans and have said 
$626.9 million more in similar assets simply aren't paying. 
</P>
<P>
The losses, industry experts said, may simply be part of running what was once 
an institution with $5.3 billion in assets, invested mostly in risky projects 
such as undeveloped Arizona land and junk bonds. Lincoln's assets at the end of 
June were $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"If we think the losses are eventually going to be $2 billion, then what we're 
seeing is loss recognition on the installment basis," said Bert Ely, an 
Alexandria, Va., industry consultant and analyst. 
</P>
<P>
For others, though, the skyrocketing losses are evidence of the government's 
ineptitude at running businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They just keep writing down assets. That's how they keep losing money," said 
James J. Feder, lead counsel for American Continental in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Feder, who is in charge of the company's legal affairs while it is in 
bankruptcy, said regulators have been compromising troubled loans, settling for 
less than their true value and writing off the balance as a loss. 
</P>
<P>
In another matter, Feder said the firm has reached a general agreement with 
regulators and creditors on a public statement that would disclose how American 
Continental would be liquidated. A federal judge in Phoenix indicated this week 
that he would approve the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Once the statement goes out, U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby then must 
approve the liquidation plan itself. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental is expected to object to certain provisions in the 
liquidation plan, but Feder predicted that Bilby would approve a plan by the 
end of November. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental liquidation value is no more than $30 million, Feder 
estimated. Most of that would come from recoveries on lawsuits the company 
would file, including one against lawyers and accountants for $12 million in 
fees paid during the year before the company's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
In a related ruling Wednesday, Bilby approved a partial settlement in lawsuits 
filed by small investors of American Continental debt securities. Settlements 
totaling $24.3 million will be paid by two law firms accused of helping Keating 
deceive investors about the company's financial condition. The amount 
represents less than 10% of the more than $250 million investors lost.

Community Psychiatric Centers Inc., benefiting largely from price increases and 
business expansion, on Thursday reported a 16% increase in net income for the 
third quarter ended Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the operator of a chain of acute psychiatric hospitals, reported 
quarterly net earnings of $19.7 million on revenue of $94.9 million, compared 
to net earnings of $16.9 million on sales of $80.3 million in the same quarter 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Community Psychiatric's earnings for the first nine months of this fiscal year 
were $62.5 million on revenue of $282.28 million, compared to earnings of $55.5 
million on revenue of $250.6 million for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Conte, senior vice president of Community Psychiatric Centers, said he 
believes that the company's adolescent business is on the rebound after 
suffering for nine months from adverse national publicity about hard-sell and 
abusive marketing in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
He said that is reflected by a slight increase in occupancy levels at the 
company's older hospitals in the third quarter, compared to declining 
occupancies for the first six months of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
But Conte acknowledged that his company's third-quarter earnings increase was 
attributable mostly to the construction and acquisition of additional 
hospitals, price increases and corporate measures undertaken to reduce 
operating costs.

THE WAR IS ON BETWEEN GRADCO, PLENUM

Gradco Systems Inc. and Plenum Publishing Corp. traded salvos Thursday as both 
companies sent out letters to shareholders criticizing the other's ability to 
turn around the struggling manufacturer of sorters for copiers and computer 
printer products. 
</P>
<P>
Keith B. Stewart, chairman and chief executive of Irvine-based Gradco, said in 
a shareholder letter that Plenum's chairman, Martin E. Tash, and his slate of 
proposed board members have no experience in Gradco's primary businesses. He 
said Tash is a disgruntled shareholder who made an "unprofitable speculative" 
short-term investment in Gradco. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has proposed to spin off the money-losing Gradco Printer Systems 
subsidiary, which makes computer printer products, into a separately traded and 
managed company as well as launch a public offering in Japan for the company's 
sorter products subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not risk control of your company and the future of your investment to a 
slate with no apparent knowledge of Gradco's businesses," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Tash said in his letter that Gradco management is fighting an expensive 
campaign against Plenum with Gradco's money. He said that Gradco management is 
not working to maximize shareholder value and that its spinoff plan should not 
be a factor in the proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has made little investment in his own company, and a number of 
executives have sold their stock, reflecting a lack of confidence in the 
company, Tash said. "Mr. Stewart is simply a hired hand, not a shareholder," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The statements were the strongest efforts yet by both sides to win the votes of 
shareholders since New York-based Plenum, a small publisher of scientific 
journals that controls 9.6% of Gradco stock, launched a battle to take control 
of Gradco's board a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tash has filed a shareholder suit accusing Stewart and certain Gradco 
executives of misappropriating corporate assets by 
</P>
<P>
awarding themselves warrants to buy shares in the Gradco Japan subsidiary at a 
discount price that could net them a windfall of more than $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco said in its letter that management believes that the $26.5-million 
investment by Japanese investors in Gradco Japan would not have transpired 
without an investment by Gradco management in the subsidiary as represented by 
the warrant transaction. The shares granted to management were restricted and 
therefore were offered to management at a discount, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco also disclosed that its debt of $25.1 million at the end of March was at 
risk of being called due because of its failure to meet financial covenants. 
Management tried to sell the company, but it decided that buyers would not 
offer a fair price because the company had lost its largest customer, Xerox 
Corp., which accounted for $21 million in revenue.

JOSEPH N. BELL: HARD HATS MAY WELL COME TO THE BARD'S RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I rediscovered William Shakespeare in an unlikely place this 
summer. At least Garden Grove seemed to me an unlikely setting to feed cultural 
appetites. It seems even more unlikely today after the City Council withdrew 
the support money for its splendid Shakespeare theater company and thus forced 
it to close down after its upcoming run of "The Importance of Being Earnest," 
which begins Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
I feel a considerable sense of personal loss, like a new friend who suddenly 
moves away just when the promise of intimacy becomes very real. The arts have 
been so badly battered in this country over the past year -- artists must feel 
like punch-drunk fighters, flailing out in every direction when they should be 
concentrating on their craft -- that it is hard anymore to feel anger. The 
action in Garden Grove just saddened and depressed me. 
</P>
<P>
We spent three warm, delicious nights last summer watching Shakespeare under 
the stars in Garden Grove. We watched "As You Like It" and "Much Ado About 
Nothing" and an evening of readings from the Bard which -- unlike the purists 
-- we found delightful. We were looking forward to expanding this feast next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't present Monday night when the Garden Grove City Council denied the 
Grove Shakespeare Festival emergency funds that would have carried it through 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But from accounts in The Times and conversations with people who were there, it 
would appear that a majority of the council believed that the company should do 
"American" plays and regards Shakespeare as a foreign intrusion that speaks an 
unwelcome cultural language. Apparently the same feeling applies to the 
Festival's production of Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales" which has 
become a staple for children in the community and will be washed out by the 
council's action. 
</P>
<P>
Satirizing this kind of provincial, jingo reasoning would be easy. Like 
shooting fish in a barrel. But at least one member of the festival family chose 
to address this attitude directly and seriously in the council meeting -- and I 
asked him later to enlarge on those remarks for me. 
</P>
<P>
David Herman -- who directed "Othello" at the festival this summer -- has 
impressive credentials for speaking out. He is English, once lived in 
Stratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare was born, served an apprenticeship as an 
actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and has been connected with the 
theater all of his working life. 
</P>
<P>
He told me that he arrived at the council meeting late, "when the debate was 
coming to a head, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The sense of it 
was that the work being produced by the festival theater was not American, and 
we needed to get some American culture in here instead of all this Shakespeare 
stuff. I had a strong feeling that money was not the problem, that the council 
majority was a lot more concerned with the nature of what they were supporting 
than with fiscal policy. 
</P>
<P>
"They were stepping on this theater as if it were a bug to be annihilated. 
There seemed little concern with the impact on the community of rejecting this 
small amount of aid. They apparently felt that this theater provided no real 
connection with the people of the community, and we were simply an elitist 
group pushing our own agenda. I felt that someone should address this feeling 
simply and directly." 
</P>
<P>
So Herman did. He told the council that when he first came to Los Angeles five 
years ago, he knew nothing about Garden Grove or the Shakespeare Festival. "But 
when I was introduced to it, I was struck with a splendid contribution it made 
to an area with a multiethnic base. Building a theater season in such an area 
around the plays of Shakespeare seemed to me both visionary and enlightened. 
</P>
<P>
"Why? Because of the enormous impact Shakespeare has made on every country and 
in every language of the world. Shakespeare truly speaks a universal language, 
and this is the only Orange County theater that offers his voice regularly and 
highly professionally. I couldn't imagine a better community for this to take 
place." 
</P>
<P>
His words didn't change any votes, but probably nothing would have at that 
point -- not even pointing out the supreme irony of rejecting Shakespeare as 
elitist in what one councilman described as a "hard-hat community." 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare wrote for the hard hats of his day. They were the people who 
flocked to his plays -- and still do in other countries of the world. 
</P>
<P>
But the dedicated people who kept the festival afloat most of this year through 
increasingly hard times are not yet ready to throw it in -- even under the 
possible threat of cancellation of the festival's lease on the city-owned 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
With their major sources of public revenue denied them, they can look only to 
private support. "And," as one of their officials told me wryly, "we don't 
attract the heavy hitters. We don't offer the glitz and panache of South Coast 
Repertory or the Performing Arts Center." 
</P>
<P>
So they're going after the lighter hitters -- you and me -- with two 
fund-raisers in October they hope will begin to underwrite a new season next 
year, and perhaps even save their Christmas show. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a walkathon -- called, naturally, "Walk for William" -- that will 
start at 8 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 13; it will cost $20, and each participant 
will be given a T-shirt to commemorate the event. The walkathon will be 
followed at noon by an auction of the company's costumes and props. They will 
be "cleaning out Shakespeare's closet" in a kind of medieval garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
The second event will be a Monte Carlo night on Oct. 26 at the Garden Grove 
Community Center; the cost, $15 or two for $25. All of the money thus raised 
will go directly to support the Grove Shakespeare Festival. 
</P>
<P>
All this agony over a few thousand dollars -- a pittance in a county as wealthy 
as this one -- seems to point up two fundamental problems: There are certain 
types of cultural events -- opera, ballet, classic theater -- which will always 
hold little interest for the majority but which are absolutely essential in the 
lifeblood of a healthy society. In a system like ours where politicians are so 
directly accountable to the majority, we need means -- either through sizable 
private or routinely budgeted public funds -- to sustain and nourish the arts. 
</P>
<P>
And second, what is happening to the Grove Festival is not just of concern to 
the citizens of Garden Grove. This is the second largest theater -- and the 
only one with a regular menu of classics -- in Orange County, and those of us 
who want to see it back for another season need to demonstrate that in tangible 
ways. Like money. 
</P>
<P>
Of course if some of those billionaire South County developers decided that 
this might be a good place to put a few thousand, it would be gratefully 
received. They wouldn't even have to take part in the walkathon. And neither do 
you and I.

STYLE: NO LONGER MERELY AN AFTERTHOUGHT, ACCESSORIES ARE FASHION FOCAL POINT;

JEWELRY, BELTS, HATS AND SCARVES CAN PUT AN INDIVIDUAL STAMP ON A LOOK AND CAN 
MAXIMIZE THE VERSATILITY OF AN OUTFIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
When June Cleaver wore pearls, she chose a small, tasteful strand that would 
not interfere with her housework. 
</P>
<P>
Those were different times, before "accessorize" had become a common household 
verb. 
</P>
<P>
Today women have turned to bigger, bolder baubles to adorn their outfits. If 
they're going to wear pearls, they're likely to wear ones the size of golf 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
No longer fashion's afterthought, accessories have become the focal point of 
one's attire. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very important," says Mary Jane Borden, owner of A La Mode Fashions in 
Irvine. "They can make an outfit look 100 times better." 
</P>
<P>
With a beaded belt, felt hat or pin, one can change a garment's entire look. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take a basic black dress you wore to a funeral that morning, change 
from pearls into rhinestones, and wear it to a formal wedding that night," 
Borden says. 
</P>
<P>
She's only half-kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Baubles and bangles have become so prominent, they've taken over entire stores. 
Brea Mall has three boutiques devoted primarily to accessories -- Xtras, 
Etcetera and the Icing, the first in a chain of upscale accessory stores in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are definitely spending more money on accessories and buying more 
extravagant things," says Carol Suda, regional manager for the Icing. 
</P>
<P>
This fall they're buying long "shoulder duster" earrings with dangling coins 
and beads, necklaces with huge "pearls" made of spun cotton and wide-cuff 
bracelets made of gleaming silver or gold. 
</P>
<P>
"Giant jewels are real popular," Suda says. "They're even wearing crystals for 
daytime now, when they never would have before." Earrings made from clusters of 
crystals have proven especially popular. 
</P>
<P>
Women are attracted to all that glitters. Most have abandoned scarves with 
small paisley prints for large chiffon squares shot through with metallic 
thread. 
</P>
<P>
A purple suede belt becomes the centerpiece of any outfit when lined with gold 
studs and bearing a clasp encrusted with beads and rhinestones, available for 
$89. Even an ordinary baseball cap looks glamorous when made of 
rhinestone-studded black velvet and doused with beads on its front flap. The 
velvet cap also costs a bit more than a standard Angels' cap -- $50 at the 
Icing. 
</P>
<P>
Women don't care that their glitz is artificial -- most of the big shield-style 
earrings are obvious fakes, handcrafted out of paper, resin, plastic or clay. 
One pair features shredded ribbons formed into miniature pompons for $28. 
</P>
<P>
"Big earrings show the gypsy in all women," Suda says. 
</P>
<P>
Accessories have grown in size and stature because they allow women to express 
themselves, no easy feat in an age of mass-produced, cookie-cutter clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"Women need to make a statement about themselves," Suda says. "Clothing has 
gotten a little boring, so women are using accessories to show their 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
That explains the current rage for ring watches, the hottest novelty item at 
the Icing. Suda stocks rings with small watch faces embedded in huge crystals. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers are looking for something different," she says. "It's a conversation 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
While Borden's shop carries fashions for big women, she stocks so much fun 
jewelry that her "skinny girls" are her best accessory customers. 
</P>
<P>
Her hottest-selling accessory of the moment: bubble bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Bubble bottles look like perfume bottles worn on a cord around the neck, but 
the wearer can untwist the cap and pull out an "itty-bitty bubble wand and blow 
itty-bitty bubbles," Borden says. They're selling at accessory counters 
everywhere, from Target to Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Borden's customers have also been snapping up big plastic whistles, painted 
gold and covered with fake jewels. 
</P>
<P>
"If your husband's across the room at a party, you can whistle for him," Borden 
says. 
</P>
<P>
At Etcetera, one can find everything from a timeless Chanel-style chain with 
faux pearls and gems to a '60s-style "thong necklace" -- a leather or silk cord 
with a large medallion, cross, crystal or tassel for decoration. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent fashion show, Etcetera took five basic black dresses from Ann 
Taylor and gave each a different look -- from ethnic with long strands of 
colored beads to evening with a gold metallic hair bow and gold jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"Clothing is getting so expensive and women want value for their dollar," says 
Robin Roberts, co-manager of Etcetera in Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"We can take a basic black dinner dress and make it look new with earrings and 
a necklace. For a little money, you can have more versatility." 
</P>
<P>
Some women have trouble coordinating jewelry with an outfit. 
</P>
<P>
"Many tend to buy accessories without having the outfit with them," Borden 
says. "That's a mistake. There could be 100 different shades of blue. It's 
better to do the outfit when you buy it." 
</P>
<P>
She suggests shopping for accessories with the outfit in tow and soliciting 
second opinions from employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Women bring me clothes and ask me to accessorize them," Borden says. 
</P>
<P>
Customers should consider the shape of their face, length of their hair and 
their build when buying accessories, Suda says. Someone with a round face 
probably should stay away from round earrings, she says, and big earrings don't 
belong on a small person. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are no rules," Suda says. "Try things that you've never worn before. 
It makes it more fun."

<P>
Forget Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and the local thrift picture begins to look 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's 26 other thrifts together earned $104.2 million in the second 
quarter. But throw in insolvent Lincoln, the government-run basket case, and 
the county's thrifts lost $59.7 million as a group. That's because Irvine-based 
Lincoln alone lost $163.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The number of profitable county thrifts outnumbered the money-losing 
institutions by nearly 3 to 1. Twenty savings and loans were in the black, 
while seven reported red figures. Among the profitable S&amp;Ls, American 
Savings Bank in Irvine led the way with $68.4 million in net income. Other big 
earners were Household Bank in Newport Beach with $15.2 million and Downey 
Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach with $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
American Savings is the remnant of a failed thrift that was bailed out with 
government funds in late 1988. It has flourished since, thanks to the 
government taking charge of its bad assets and tax write-offs given to the new 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
But there were losers besides Lincoln too. United California Savings Bank in 
Anaheim lost $5.1 million and Newport Beach-based FarWest Savings, which has 
been hurt by the writedown of junk bonds and bad loans, lost $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
One thrift, University Savings Bank, slipped into insolvency under two of the 
three strict federal tests for capital. The thrift, which moved its 
headquarters to Newport Beach barely a year ago, recently returned to its 
native Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of 1990, county thrifts posted a combined loss of $207 
million. But again Lincoln was the major culprit, losing $297 million in the 
first half of the year. Without Lincoln, the other 26 thrifts earned $90 
million in the first two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, all county thrifts, excluding Lincoln, earned $82 million. Lincoln, 
however, took a big hit -- recording a $788-million loss for the period as 
federal regulators forced a writedown of its assets and loans. Regulators 
seized the thrift in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The brightest hope for county thrifts is that Lincoln and Charter Savings Bank 
in Newport Beach are now the only county S&amp;Ls in the hands of regulators. 
Regulators have sold the main operations of two other government-run thrifts -- 
Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach and Western Empire Savings &amp; 
Loan in Irvine -- since the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, regulators have routinely been in control of at least 
four county thrifts every quarter. Orange County, once home to 38 S&amp;Ls, has 
become the state's thrift graveyard with the failure of 19 shops over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Healthy county thrifts, as their counterparts elsewhere, are slowly picking 
their way through the rubble of the S&amp;L debacle, which nationwide is 
expected to cost U.S. taxpayers more than $500 billion over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
But even thrifts that have solid capital -- their last bastion against losses 
-- are showing signs of struggling with the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate, even in California, has slowed, and industry experts say that will 
mean thrifts will have to allocate more money for reserves against possible 
losses. That means lower income for many and losses for others. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts are also under a mandate to improve their ratio of capital to assets, 
but they have found it tough to raise the needed cash. To improve their ratios 
quickly, they often cut assets, and 17 county thrifts reduced their loan and 
investment portfolios since June, 1989. Overall, county S&amp;L assets fell 21% 
over the last year.

'DARK CLOUDS' FOR ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
INDEX TAKES BIGGEST FALL IN 3 YEARS

<TEXT>
<P>
The government's main economic forecasting gauge plunged 1.2% in August, its 
steepest fall in three years and an indication, one economist said, of "nothing 
but dark clouds" ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 11 components of the Commerce Department's Index of Leading 
Indicators were off, including stock prices and an index measuring consumer 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for new plants and equipment dropped. Unfilled orders to U.S. 
manufacturers fell, as did building permits and the money supply. Weekly 
unemployment claims were up. 
</P>
<P>
The report was the first government look into the economic future since Iraq 
occupied Kuwait Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The only positive contributors were slower business delivery times, an increase 
in orders for consumer goods, an increase in the price of raw materials and a 
longer workweek. 
</P>
<P>
But economist Kermit Baker of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., said even the 
longer workweek might be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it's an indication that industry is trying to get by with its current 
work force rather than hire new people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other economists were similarly gloomy. 
</P>
<P>
"The decline in the leading indicators provides further proof that the 
recession began in August," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National 
Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're not in a recession, we're skating close to it," said John Silvia, a 
financial economist with Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was even more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing but dark clouds," he said, noting that preliminary economic 
indicators released this month "indicate that the August number was not a 
one-month phenomenon . . . the picture I'm getting is that this is a long-term 
trend." 
</P>
<P>
The drop in the index, designed to forecast activity six to nine months ahead, 
was the sharpest since a 1.4% decline in the month after the Oct. 19, 1987, 
stock market crash, when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
plummeted 508 points in one day. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe Wall Street has now turned bearish again and is in for 
a prolonged period of falling prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the stock market is a forward-looking indicator, the precipitous decline 
in stock prices is more tied to expectations of recession than to the 
deterioration in corporate earnings witnessed so far," Jasinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The general definition of a recession is two consecutive declines in the gross 
national product.

O'BRIEN DIES; OVERSEER OF SPORTS, POLITICS

<P>
Larry O'Brien, who directed John F. Kennedy's campaign for President and later 
served for a decade as commissioner of the National Basketball Assn., has died 
at 73. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien died at 6 p.m. Thursday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, 
said Myrna Manners, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
He suffered from cancer, said Joseph Napolitan, a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's talents for organization and compromise made him one of the party's 
leading strategists for two decades. He directed Kennedy's successful 
senatorial and presidential campaigns, served as congressional liaison for 
President Kennedy and for President Lyndon B. Johnson, was postmaster general 
for three years and was twice named chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien left politics in 1972, and in 1975 he was named commissioner of the 
National Basketball Assn. He remained in that post until 1984. 
</P>
<P>
It was O'Brien's Democratic Party office that was broken into in Washington's 
Watergate complex in 1972, a burglary that set off one of the major scandals in 
American political annals. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien was with Kennedy when the President was assassinated in Dallas in 1963, 
and he was with Sen. Robert F. Kennedy when he was assassinated in Los Angeles 
in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, the son of Irish immigrants from County Cork, was known as a canny 
political operator who knew the importance of voter registration drives and 
forging political alliances. 
</P>
<P>
He joined John Kennedy when Kennedy was an ambitious congressman and directed 
his campaign against Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge in 1952. Kennedy upset Lodge, and 
in 1958 he easily won reelection. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, Kennedy decided to run for President and named O'Brien his campaign 
director. The candidate won each of the seven primaries he entered, and at the 
1960 convention in Los Angeles, O'Brien's delegate count was so accurate that 
he predicted within a half-vote the final tally. 
</P>
<P>
As Kennedy's liaison with Congress, O'Brien worked skillfully but largely 
unsuccessfully for the Administration's "New Frontier" legislative package. 
After Kennedy's assassination, he continued in the post under Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the assassination, the legislative floodgates opened, and 
O'Brien helped usher through the greatest body of social law since the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien also served as Johnson's postmaster general, and later was Democratic 
National Committee chairman until 1972. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, after spending the intervening years working on Wall Street, O'Brien 
was elected to succeed the late Walter Kennedy as NBA commissioner. It was a 
time when free agency and big money were reshaping professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
It was with O'Brien's guidance that the NBA settled the so-called Oscar 
Robertson suit in 1976, which paved the way to free agency in the league.

<P>
State regulators, moving to establish the world's most stringent tailpipe 
emission rules, today approved a sweeping plan that includes a requirement for 
mass-production of electric cars by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that these are very dramatic requirements we are imposing," said 
Jananne Sharpless, chairwoman of the state's Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a lot of work, but we think it's feasible." 
</P>
<P>
The program, designed to clean up some of nation's dirtiest air, will require 
auto makers to start selling progressively cleaner cars beginning in 1994. By 
the year 2003, all of the estimated 2 million cars sold in the state would have 
to be producing 70% less pollutants than 1993 models. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes the requirement that 2% of all new cars sold in California in 
1998 emit no smog -- in effect a mandate to produce an electric car.

President Bush today promised the exiled emir of Kuwait that the United States 
will not rest until Iraqi occupying forces are driven from his country and will 
keep all its options open as to how that might be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will fail," Bush said in farewell remarks to visiting Sheik Jabbar al 
Ahmed al Sabah, who visited the White House for the first time since Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion drove him into exile in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait, free Kuwait, will endure," Bush said. " . . . His Highness and I agree 
that we must keep all our options open to ensure that Iraq's unlawful 
occupation of Kuwait is ended and Kuwait's legitimate government is restored." 
</P>
<P>
Concluding an Oval Office talk and a luncheon, Bush told the emir the United 
States will not weaken in its resolve to force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
to pull his troops out of Kuwait and allow its royal rulers to return. The 
United States has sent about 150,000 troops plus ships and planes to the 
Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the day I can visit you and the Kuwaiti people in your 
rightful home, Kuwait," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he wanted to "single out the valiant efforts of the Kuwaiti 
resistance," whose members are fighting for their country's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"Many have already paid the ultimate price," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Mideast, thousands of Iranians heeded a call by Iran's ruling clergy 
today and demonstrated in Tehran against the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio said the crowds assembled at five points in the Iranian capital 
and marched toward the Tehran University prayer grounds chanting anti-U.S. 
slogans. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were called by the Committee to Coordinate Islamic 
Propaganda, a group controlled by Iran's ruling clergy. For the past four days 
Tehran radio broadcast statements from the committee asking people to turn out 
for the march. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has condemned the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and has called on Hussein to 
pull his troops out of Kuwaiti territory, but has been more vocal in its 
criticism of the U.S. forces in the region. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Spain and South Korea said today they joined other 
nations in pulling envoys from embassies besieged by Iraqi troops. For the past 
five weeks, Iraqi soldiers have been trying to starve diplomats out of their 
compounds in Kuwait city. At last word, the U.S. ambassador and envoys in more 
than a dozen other embassies were still resisting the siege. 
</P>
<P>
In Madrid today, a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country's last 
diplomat in Kuwait fled to Baghdad.

Israeli forces went on increased alert today as the country started to close 
down for Yom Kippur, Judaism's holiest day. 
</P>
<P>
Motor traffic, radio and television broadcasts and all work will cease for 25 
hours starting tonight, and the rare motorist who ventures onto the roads risks 
being stoned. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbis repeated an annual appeal to Jews not to harm ambulances or security 
forces traveling on the sacred day. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is haunted by a 1973 surprise attack by Arab armies on Yom Kippur as the 
Jews fasted and prayed. Nearly 2,700 Israeli soldiers died in the war, and the 
armed forces have since gone on alert every year, a military spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, is the most solemn day in the Hebrew 
calendar. Many otherwise secular Jews fast from sunset Friday until an hour 
after sunset Saturday.

Police have cracked one of the world's biggest illegal rhinoceros horn and 
elephant tusk operations, shutting off an Africa-to-Asia smuggling pipeline, 
officers announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Police valued the tusks and horns at $2.73 million. Police arrested two 
Taiwanese citizens caught with 29 rhino horns and in a related swoop caught 
another Taiwanese and a South African who had seven tusks and allegedly tried 
to send 81 horns to Taiwan, said Capt. Pieter Lategan of the Endangered Species 
Protection Unit. 
</P>
<P>
Lategan said the horns and tusks probably were sent from Malawi via Swaziland 
to South Africa to be processed in Taiwan for sale as aphrodisiacs and 
pain-killer powder.

Two top officials at the Chernobyl nuclear power station who were ordered 
jailed for 10 years for the 1986 catastrophe are to be freed early, a spokesman 
for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today. 
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Ignatenko told a news conference that the plant's chief engineer, 
Anatoly Dyatlov, is being released for health reasons. His deputy, Nikolai 
Fomin, will be freed on Gorbachev's orders in response to appeals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were sentenced in July, 1987, to terms in a labor camp, after being 
found guilty of gross violations of safety regulations in conducting an 
unauthorized experiment that led to the April, 1986, blast.

A French couple following a fad for underwater childbearing were charged with 
manslaughter after their baby drowned at birth in a plastic wading pool, police 
in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence said today. 
</P>
<P>
They said the parents -- a 33-year-old nurse and her husband, a 34-year-old 
poet -- reported the death Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Underwater childbirth, pioneered in France, is said by its supporters to 
provide a calm and untroubled start to a baby's life. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the couple installed the inflatable paddling pool in the kitchen of 
a friend, a nurse who told them she was not qualified to deliver babies, 
especially underwater. The nurse has been charged with failing to help a person 
in danger. 
</P>
<P>
But police said the couple had not consulted specialist doctors or organized a 
warm place for the baby to spend its first hours after being born in water. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the mother had "an unpleasant experience" during the birth of her 
first child eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The couple believed the aquatic delivery had been a success, only becoming 
concerned an hour later when the baby showed no signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had decided on a name for the baby boy before he was born -- Noah.

A union representing about 1,200 San Francisco newspaper workers unanimously

Local guild President Steven R. Michael said no deadline for completion of

Toy merchants in Japan today launched an association to help small toy stores 
modernize and survive competition from large foreign retailers such as 
U.S.-owned Toys R Us. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Assn. of Specialty Toy Shops, comprising 520 small toy retailers, 
aims to protect its members from retailers like Toys R Us Japan, the 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Toys R Us Japan announced plans to open about 100 stores in Japan over 
the next 10 years. Protests by local merchants have helped put the issue of 
large stores versus small ones on the agenda of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The group will work with operators of small toy stores in regions around the 
country where Toys R Us plans to open its stores to help them develop ways to 
compete with the big retailers, said Takanari Seki, the association's vice 
chairman.

Two homosexual men filed suit against Continental Airlines because their 
request for a frequent-flier companion ticket was rejected when they could not 
produce a marriage certificate. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court by Joseph Preis, 53, and Larry 
Hiller, 50, both of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
They claim they have lived together for 32 years, have joint bank accounts and 
"each considers himself to be the spousal equivalent and family of the other." 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends the men wanted to take a weeklong trip to London on Dec. 1, 
1989, but Continental refused to issue a free companion ticket through its 
One-Pass program. 
</P>
<P>
Continental spokesman Dave Messing said the companion tickets "are for family 
members only" and that couples who live together are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
The two men didn't make the trip and are asking for at least $300,000 in 
damages.

<P>
All flights to Savannah, Ga., will be suspended from Nov. 1, and Midway will 
also withdraw from service eight of its least fuel-efficient aircraft.

OIL PRICES HOVER NEAR RECORD PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crude oil prices hovered near their record levels today in the absence of fresh 
news from the Middle East to prompt another price surge on well-stocked world 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Traders, who Thursday pushed oil prices up to record highs in nervous sessions 
dominated by war rumors, cautiously limited their buying, keeping prices at an 
apparent holding level just below their peak. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark West Texas Intermediate 
crude for November delivery found strength near its record closing level of 
$39.54 a barrel, established Thursday. From the opening bell, the key U.S. 
crude traded mostly a few cents above or below its record level, an indication 
the market was satisfied with its present strength. 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, the WTI's high for the day was at $39.95, somewhat below 
the high recorded during Thursday's session at $40.10 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is steady and rather quiet in the absence of news from the Middle 
East, and traders have little inclinations to establish fresh positions," said 
Steve Platt, senior energy analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. 
"People are nervous about the recent volatility, and for now, they want to stay 
on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
On the Merc, refined oil products were finding new strength and were quoted at 
midday between one and two cents above their closing levels of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On the European spot market, where crude is bought and sold for cash, Britain's 
widely traded North Sea Brent retreated slightly from its $41-a-barrel high 
Thursday and was quoted at midday at $40.80 a barrel.

Washington Post sportswriter Christine Brennan defended Boston Herald colleague 
Lisa Olson today, saying Olson's sexual harassment by several New England 
Patriots football players is "the worst I've ever heard in my 10 years of 
sports writing." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in 500 locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
I have rolled my eyes. I have laughed. I've had towels thrown at me. I've had 
whoops and hollers," said Brennan, who was the Post's beat reporter covering 
the Washington Redskins in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been taking it for 10 years, Lisa's been taking it for that long," 
Brennan said during an interview on Cable News Network. "We've had hundreds of 
women taking it, taking and taking it and we continue to do so because we love 
these jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Olson said Thursday that during the Sept. 17 incident in the Patriots' locker 
room, she was sitting down when Zeke Mowatt came up, exposed himself and made 
lewd remarks. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had summoned Mowatt to a meeting today in New 
York, but the meeting was postponed Thursday when Tagliabue said he would 
appoint a special counsel to investigate the incident.

WHITE SOX AND DEMOLISHER DISPUTE OWNERSHIP OF COMISKEY PARK SEATS

<P>
Chicago White Sox officials who have prosecuted fans attempting to steal 
Comiskey Park seats as souvenirs face the possibility of losing them to the 
company hired to demolish baseball's oldest stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Irv Kolko, president of Speedway Wrecking, told the Chicago Tribune in today's 
edition that the company's bid of more than $1.2 million was based, in part, on 
the value of memorabilia the company could salvage and sell. 
</P>
<P>
Speedway attorney Michael Roche said the company was prepared to take the issue 
to court. 
</P>
<P>
"This was something carefully factored into the bid, negotiated and bargained 
for," Roche said. "The contract with the Illinois Sports Authority couldn't be 
clearer." 
</P>
<P>
Roche said the 1988 contract gives the company the rights to fixtures, 
including bricks and seats, but not the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute surfaced as a result of the team's announcement that it plans to 
donate to charity money made from the sale of artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Pizer, team executive vice president, said the contract specifically 
states seats and other memorabilia are to remain property of the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
White Sox Manager Jeff Torborg says the team wants football player Deion 
Sanders because of his versatility and talent as an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, now a defensive back for the Atlanta Falcons, was claimed on 
unconditional release waivers Thursday by the White Sox after a short-lived 
stint with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Torborg said the few times he has seen Sanders play, the outfielder showed 
exceptional speed and the instincts of a baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders was released this week by the Yankees. He has until next Tuesday to 
accept or reject the waiver claim. If he rejects it, he is a free agent and can 
talk to all teams.

</P>
<P>
Maleeva-Fragniere, ranked ninth in the world, beat Navratilova, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. 
After losing her first seven matches against Navratilova, the Bulgarian-born 
Maleeva-Fragniere has rebounded with a two-match winning streak. She beat 
Navratilova in the U.S. Open, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I played spotty," Navratilova said. "I was good for two minutes, then bad for 
three minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva-Fragniere's well-placed passing shots forced Navratilova to stay back 
on the baseline and deprived her of opportunities at the net. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past three years I had hard training aimed at playing more aggressively 
and gaining physicial strength," Maleeva-Fragniere said. "I think it's paid off 
now."

In the other quarterfinal match, fourth-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez defeated 
Helena Sukova, 6-3, 6-4.

SEASON'S ON THE BRINK FOR JAYS AND RED SOX; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE TWO RIVALS WILL MEET AT FENWAY PARK FOR THE OPENER OF A 
THREE-GAME SHOWDOWN.

After 172 days and 156 games, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Boston Red Sox are 
tied for the American League East lead. 
</P>
<P>
And what amounts to a six-game season gets under way at Fenway Park tonight 
with the two rivals meeting in the opener of a three-game showdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bound to come down to this," Toronto's Mookie Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way this season has been going. Up and down. We're in first place a 
day or a week. They're there for a day or week." 
</P>
<P>
While the Blue Jays relaxed in Boston during a schedule break Thursday, the Red 
Sox moved back into a first-place tie with a 3-2 victory on a quickie road trip 
to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled Boston, which trailed Toronto by 1 1/2 games Tuesday night, 
to tie the Blue Jays with an 84-72 record. 
</P>
<P>
It also meant that neither the Blue Jays nor the Red Sox will clinch the 
division flag this weekend, although a sweep by either would mean at least a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Boston will wind up the regular season at home with three games against the 
Chicago White Sox on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Toronto finishes with three 
games in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of those weird seasons, and no one knows why," Wilson said. 
"Everybody has to wait until the very end. The series this weekend might not 
decide anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
Neither manager, Cito Gaston of Toronto nor Joe Morgan of Boston, would predict 
what might happen in the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun, and I think whichever team is more relaxed will have the 
advantage," Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all tied up with a chance to win it all," Morgan said. "You can't ask 
for much more at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are heading into the series playing inconsistently, the same as they 
have all season. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto, smarting from two losses in a row in Milwaukee, is 6-4 in its last 10 
games. Boston has won two games in a row after going 2-9, including a 2-8 road 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
"In your wildest dreams, would you picture us to be in this situation?" 
Boston's Jody Reed asked. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox led the Blue Jays by 6 1/2 games early this month, an advantage 
built with a 10-game winning streak begun with three victories in Toronto. But 
after being swept by Oakland and losing star pitcher Roger Clemens to shoulder 
tendinitis, the Red Sox went into a swoon. They lost 15 of 21 games, falling 1 
1/2 games behind Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox have dominated the Blue Jays so far this season, leading the season 
series 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays expect to have third baseman Kelly Gruber back from a bout with 
the flu for the series' opener tonight. Gruber has been a one-man gang with his 
bat this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox hope to have third baseman Wade Boggs back. Boggs had lower back 
pain and was forced to leave a game early Tuesday night. He is 0-for-12 and 
1-for-20, dropping his average to .304, far below his .347 lifetime mark.

LONGACRES SOLD, CLOSES ITS DOORS

The last race has been run at Longacres, the longtime fixture of thoroughbred 
racing in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old race track, which ended its meeting last week, has been sold to 
the Boeing Co., it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the sale were not announced, although King County has valued the 
215-acre property at $23.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Longacres, the only track in the Seattle area, will not be open for racing next 
year, sending shivers through the state's horse racing industry, especially its 
breeders. The state licenses 12,000 industry workers, said Dan Agnew, president 
of the Washington Breeders Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned about this," Agnew said. "I'm afraid if we lose racing 
for a period of time, we're going to lose a lot of our owners and patrons." 
</P>
<P>
Morrie, Michael and Ken Alhadeff, who owned the track, said they decided it 
"was no longer economically viable for us to operate," because of increased 
property values combined with declining revenues, increasing expenses and other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very unfortunate and difficult time. This is not easy. But the 
realities are we cannot operate as we prefer," Morrie Alhadeff said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Alhadeffs said Boeing told them they could continue to operate Longacres 
for "up to three years" as a transition period but they elected to close it now 
because "we just felt it was not viable." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing, which was not represented at the news conference, said in a release 
that it planned to develop the property but had not decided what activities 
will be located at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Longacres, about two miles south of Seattle, was surrounded by 
farmland. But the area now is rapidly being built up. 
</P>
<P>
The Alhadeffs said they were convinced that a new race course "will be built 
within two years in western Washington." 
</P>
<P>
A thoroughbred owner, Mark Dedomenico, said this week that he had assembled a 
group of 15 to 20 people who have pledged a total of $100 million to build a 
new track in the Seattle area if Longacres was sold and closed.

SANTANA LOOKS FORWARD TO NEW 'PERKS'

With his new album, "Spirits Dancing in the Flesh," Carlos Santana wanted the 
same feeling of "oneness" experienced at the finale of the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
"Every four years at the Olympics, you see people from all walks of life 
joining hands, dancing, laughing together, crying. I wanted to do the kind of 
album to create that spirit every day," he said in an interview at Columbia 
Records, where he has been since his first album in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The first video, for "Peace on Earth . . . Mother Earth . . . Third Stone from 
the Sun," he said, "shows the Earth is the womb and we are the babies. Forget 
about national anthems, flags and passports and get into one-family 
consciousness. That turns me on. 
</P>
<P>
"The first part of that piece was composed by John Coltrane, the second by me 
and the third by Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
"I met Hendrix at a concert. He mentioned about joining my band. Musically, he 
knew the band was embracing something different than show business, that he was 
being put into. We were just kids, but he knew. I think he had enough of show 
business. He wanted to seriously play some music." 
</P>
<P>
This is the last album under his present Columbia contract, and his thoughts 
are full of what he wants in a new contract -- the chance to advise the company 
about non-mainstream records. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a big juicy contract with a lot of money," he said. "I would like 
to create a new branch in the company that deals with people in a different way 
than the predictable." 
</P>
<P>
Only college radio is open to experimenting with music programming, said the 
man of whom it has been declared, "He IS Latin rock." 
</P>
<P>
"This company needs a branch of rebels and renegades," he said. "I want to work 
with them. There are a lot of bands not that predictable -- the Fabulous 
Thunderbirds, Tracy Chapman, Bonnie Raitt, John Lee Hooker. Turn on the radio, 
it is very insulting. A lot of people don't want the same formula of canned 
soup. They want the real gumbo." Outspoken and never at a loss for words, 
Santana says that Columbia Records would like him to repeat "Black Magic Woman" 
of 1970. "They treat you as a legend and don't put your new records in the 
stores. Every time I go on the road for the last five years, it's been sold 
out. People are waiting for the new thing we're going to play." 
</P>
<P>
Santana found it frustrating to take "The Healer," which he composed, and the 
soundtrack to "La Bamba" to Columbia and have them rejected. "La Bamba" came 
out on Warner Bros. and "The Healer" on Chameleon Records. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't done music for a film since "La Bamba." 
</P>
<P>
"All the scripts they send me are demeaning to women. If I can't play music in 
front of my four sisters, Mom, wife and daughters, I won't play it. Thank God 
I'm in a position where I don't need to do it," Santana said.

'LA STUPENDA' JOAN SUTHERLAND TO TAKE LAST BOW

Joan Sutherland, one of the great sopranos of the 20th Century, will make her 
farewell operatic performance here next week -- saying goodby to the stage in 
the city where she was born 63 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Idolized as "La Stupenda" by the audience at Milan's La Scala, Sutherland is 
due to end her career at the Sydney Opera House on Tuesday with a performance 
of Meyerbeer's "Les Huguenots." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's been such a wonderful career I don't want to go on until somebody 
starts saying: 'I do wish the old girl would get off. She's not what she used 
to be,' " Sutherland said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to an age where I don't want that routine or that discipline anymore. 
I want to do things that other people count as everyday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland is ranked with Maria Callas as the most important female influence 
on opera since World War II, enlarging the repertoire of the soprano to include 
coloratura roles forgotten since the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
In the 31 years since she stunned London's Covent Garden with her performance 
in the title role of Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor," Sutherland has been 
idolized for her powerful voice and Wagnerian stage presence. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing problems with arthritis and fears that her voice was showing its age 
persuaded Sutherland to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland made her stage debut in Sydney in 1951. That was before the days of 
the Sydney Opera House, and Australia had limited opportunities for a budding 
soprano, so she left for London. 
</P>
<P>
After studying at the Royal College of Music, Sutherland was hired by the 
Covent Garden company. She made her British debut in Mozart's "The Magic Flute" 
in October, 1952. 
</P>
<P>
By then she was being coached by conductor Richard Bonynge, whom she would 
marry in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
"I first heard her voice in 1947 or 1948. I thought it was a wonderful voice, 
but I thought it was a cold voice and not a communicative instrument at that 
time," Bonynge said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Bonynge was convinced that Sutherland should veer from the obvious operatic 
road toward Wagner and Strauss and develop a coloratura voice of dramatic, 
florid flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
Since the turn of the century, coloratura parts had been sung by "canaries," 
sopranos with light, pure voices, but Sutherland was to change this, 
resurrecting operas such as Donizetti's "Lucrezia Borgia" and "La Fille du 
Regiment" with her rich voice. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland was initially doubtful about the change of style, but Bonynge's 
advice proved the basis of his wife's lasting fame, which began on Feb. 17, 
1959, the first night of "Lucia di Lammermoor," directed by Italy's Franco 
Zeffirelli. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland came down the stairs in a blood-stained nightgown in Lucia's mad 
scene, and she was hailed a star after a performance dubbed by one critic as 
one of the greatest sensations in operatic history. 
</P>
<P>
Since then she has sung in 48 operas, made more than 80 recordings and appeared 
onstage with most of the postwar greats. 
</P>
<P>
Now a grandmother -- Sutherland's only son has two children -- she plans to 
spend her retirement writing an autobiography and traveling, although she has 
not ruled out a return to the recording studio.

LIZ SMITH: RIVERS' SHOW MAY HAVE PROMPTED TAYLOR'S LIBEL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE NATIONAL Enquirer may have the "Joan Rivers Show" and their own former 
gossip columnist R. Couri Hay to thank for that $20-million lawsuit Elizabeth 
Taylor has slapped against the beleaguered tabloid weekly. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, Hay was a guest on Rivers' TV talkfest. When the chat got 
around to Taylor, still hospitalized and dreadfully ill with pneumonia, Couri 
began telling Joan and her live audience how Taylor was drinking and hiding 
liquor bottles under her bed. 
</P>
<P>
It was verbatim from the National Enquirer, although he did not mention the 
tabloid by name. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's public relations people were appalled that anyone would sit and say 
such things on TV as if they were actual facts, and it is believed that they 
then went back and took another good hard look at the Enquirer story itself. 
(Heretofore, Elizabeth had always shrugged off the tabloid's stories about 
her.) 
</P>
<P>
During Couri's recital, to make matters worse, Joan Rivers laughed and made a 
few wisecracks, joking that Taylor would leave the hospital "thin, but drunk." 
This added fuel to the Taylor reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Television -- still more powerful than it knows! 
</P>
<P>
ACTING IS one way to get to the top, but it is a cruel and ugly business for 
the most part and even "arriving" at the top is no guarantee that one won't be 
savaged and torn to shreds by the critics. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rich of the New York Times recently reviewed the new lead in the Broadway 
musical hit "Gypsy." He gave Linda Lavin one of the worst write-ups in theater 
history and left the Rialto gasping for breath as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last Sunday, just to compound matters, the newspaper offered up another 
opinion by David Richards in which a headline went out of its way to smash 
Lavin like a fly on a windshield. The paper said: "In the Role Linda Lavin 
Comes Up Short." Lavin recently replaced Tyne Daly in the role. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the idol of millions from the TV series "Alice" and for the 
hard-working and gifted Lavin, who won an Antoinette Perry Award for her 
performance as the mother in Neil Simon's play "Broadway Bound." 
</P>
<P>
But here is the capper to this terrible rush of events. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Simon is out in Hollywood getting ready to turn his "Broadway Bound" 
dramatic comedy into a movie. So guess who Simon wants for the role in which 
Linda Lavin won the Tony? 
</P>
<P>
Neil Simon now wants Tyne Daly to play it.
