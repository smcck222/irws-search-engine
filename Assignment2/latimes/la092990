RAPE OF LA MESA GIRL, 11, SHOCKS STUDENTS, TEACHERS;

ON SIXTH-GRADER.

Cal Strickland is still haunted by the scene he encountered while en route to 
school Thursday morning -- the image of a man walking near busy Fletcher 
Parkway, his hand on the shoulder of a young boy carrying a violin case. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland, principal of Parkway Middle School in La Mesa, thought there was 
something strange about the pair walking near the school's playing field, 
especially in light of "all the kooks who expose themselves to the kids around 
here." 
</P>
<P>
So the 19-year veteran administrator parked his car and took a walk around the 
school grounds, asking about the little boy with the violin case. 
</P>
<P>
But as Strickland and the rest of the school community were soon to learn, that 
"boy" was actually an 11-year-old girl -- one of his own students -- who was 
raped by that same stranger only moments after being spotted by the attentive 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, parents, students, teachers and even police investigators expressed 
shock over the assault, in which the sixth-grader was grabbed about 8:15 a.m. 
as she walked up a set of wooden stairs at Amaya Drive and Fletcher Parkway 
leading to the rear of the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was dragged to a brushy area near the playing field and sexually 
attacked by the man who had followed her for at least a block before 
overpowering her. He reportedly struck the child several times, leaving bruises 
on her forehead, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I wish I'd gone right back down there as soon as I saw them," Strickland 
said Friday afternoon, standing outside his office as the strains of several 
unschooled clarinets wafted from the nearby gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
"But I only got a glimpse of them. It didn't seem that stressful. It was almost 
casual. The guy had his hand on what I thought was a boy's shoulder. Now I know 
that all the while he was threatening that little girl to keep walking or he 
would hurt her or kill her." 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday afternoon, only hours after the rape was reported, concerned 
parents began to volunteer their time to patrol streets around the suburban 
school -- where more than two-thirds of 850 students either walk or are dropped 
off each morning by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
More parents who later attended an annual "Back to School Night" also 
volunteered after 400 of them were given details of the attack by school 
administrators and La Mesa police. 
</P>
<P>
School counselors also met with distraught students who were particularly close 
to the victim. On Thursday, teachers in each homeroom talked with students 
about the importance of being safety conscious. 
</P>
<P>
School officials also sent home with students a letter to parents outlining 
several precautions such as having their children walk to school with a buddy, 
not to talk with strangers or arrive at school before 8:30 a.m. when 
supervisors arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to rely on you to provide for the safety of your child from home to 
the school campus or to the bus stop," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also closed off the stairway where the girl was attacked and advised 
that all students enter school grounds from the front entrance. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Bob Bush said he didn't mind playing school bus driver for his 
12-year-old granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Like other parents, he's afraid about what lurks outside the safety of school 
grounds -- even though six plain-clothed detectives had cased the area earlier 
that morning before school started. 
</P>
<P>
He grimaced as he talked about the rape. Nothing like that should ever happen 
to any woman, he said. But an 11-year-old girl? 
</P>
<P>
"It must be some kind of animal out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Harris, a La Mesa police investigator, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Any rape case is bad, but here's a young child who's not even a teen-ager, 
who's walking the street, minding her own business," he said. "I mean, this 
guy's got a real problem because this little girl didn't even look like a 
teen-ager. She looked more like 8 or 9 years old." 
</P>
<P>
La Mesa police, who have assigned a team of five investigators to the case, 
said they have already received more than 50 telephone calls from parents with 
tips on the possible identity of the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities describe their suspect as white, 5-foot-8, weighing about 150 
pounds. He has muscular forearms and dark brown hair, which he wears in a butch 
cut except for two inches of curly locks on the nape of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant reportedly was wearing faded blue jeans, white sneakers and a 
white button-down shirt with pink and gray stripes. He also has a slight case 
of acne on his cheekbones, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's many, many years since I've seen something like this and it makes me 
sick," said Detective Sgt. Chuck Braddy, head of the investigative team. "It's 
been a good 12 years since I've seen a victim so young, raped by a stranger." 
</P>
<P>
Barbera Garcia, a Parkway Middle School counselor, said several students have 
expressed concern for the victim. "One girl said it was all she could think 
about the entire day -- what her friend must have gone through," Garcia said. 
"She said she was so dizzy, she couldn't concentrate on her schoolwork." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Principal Tracy Manning said the attack has made everyone feel 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"This little girl was innocently walking to school, looking forward to a day of 
learning and then she has to go through something like that," she said. "I 
can't think of anything more innocent on the entire earth -- a little girl 
walking to school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so angered by this I can't think of an adjective to describe a man who 
would stoop so low to do such a thing to a young child." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, seventh-grader Chris Moro recalled being angry when 
Manning interrupted the student lunch the day before to tell children about the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mad," he said. "I'd like to turn this guy in to the cops. He's 
disgusting. He should be put in jail and never let out." 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, a mother who sat in her car waiting to pick up her daughter 
didn't seem as concerned. "It's a Jewish holiday and I'm home cooking, it's the 
only reason I'm here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime happens everyplace. So I'm not concerned. It was random happenstance. 
For me and my child, it's business as usual, pal." And then she drove off. 
</P>
<P>
Rondi Prescott wasn't so sure. Her sixth-grade daughter sits directly in front 
of the injured girl in class, she said, and she has heard firsthand how a rape 
can affect an 11-year-old child. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the girl's eighth-grade brother walks to school with her every 
morning but he was sick or something that day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, she had a friend stay overnight at her house last night so she's 
handling all this pretty well. It's her mother, who's a single parent, who's 
taking it badly." 
</P>
<P>
Prescott said that numerous parents planned to begin driving their children to 
and from school for the time being. "We're all in desperate fear for our 
children. I mean, it happened in broad daylight." 
</P>
<P>
Like other parents, she called for the school to begin a program where working 
parents can drop their children early as they leave for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Other schools have it, so should this one," said mother Jenni Mendel as she 
waited for her daughter outside the school. "There's too many budget cutbacks 
around here. That's the reason there's so many walkers. Because the bus program 
went under the budget ax." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Prescott said, it's time to start the emotional healing of a 
little girl who had endured a day most adults would deplore. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter had me pick up a little stuffed animal for her friend," she said. 
"She said she liked cats. That and this card." 
</P>
<P>
It showed the picture of a little girl, a fairy tale character, watering some 
pretty flowers. "I'm so glad our friendship blossomed," it read. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if that little girl seems like she's OK, I'm still worried," Prescott 
said. "Because the scars from something like this go very, very deep."

HISTORIC HONKY-TONK; 
</P>
<P>
ROARING '20S CLUB STILL GOING STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Dust devils swirl in the parking lot and sometimes gust through the open double 
doors of the Pomerado Club, once known as the Big Stone Lodge and soon to again 
bear that historic name. 
</P>
<P>
A little dust seems right at home in this ranging wooden structure with its 
supporting columns of boulders brought from the surrounding Poway hills. The 
rungs of the wooden bar stools are scuffed from decades of cowboy boots, the 
historic pictures on the walls are flecked with beer foam and an occasional 
hole from an errant dart. The corners host cobwebs and the walls and ceiling, 
according to old-timers, bear at least a dozen bullet holes. 
</P>
<P>
It's a place that leads one to wonder: "If those walls could talk . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Big Stone Lodge claims the title of "the county's oldest continuously operating 
honky-tonk," according to its new owner, Jerry Long, who bought the old Poway 
building about five months ago and plans to make it a restaurant and dance spot 
with a decidedly country-western theme. 
</P>
<P>
In doing research on the building, Long discovered that it had been a roadhouse 
and dance hall since the mid-1920s when Dr. Homer Hansen had the namesake 
boulders brought down to the creekside tract and built the building near the 
site of the Twenty Mile House, an adobe way station and drinking establishment 
where drivers on the San Diego &amp; Escondido Stage Line had once obtained 
fresh horses for their daily run. Area historians are unsure if the Twenty Mile 
House was still operating when the Stone Lodge was build. 
</P>
<P>
But Dolora Powers, a Poway Historical Society member who came to Poway in 1925, 
remembers when the Stone Lodge was new. 
</P>
<P>
"It was built after I moved here," Powers recalls. "It must have been in the 
'20s that it was built." 
</P>
<P>
Powers remembers how Hansen and his partners at first planned to build a motel 
-- called a tourist court in those days -- on Metate Lane. But the project 
"went belly up," so the developers moved over to Pomerado Road -- then the main 
artery between San Diego and Escondido -- and built the Big Stone Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a teen-ager, I just didn't go in that place," Powers said. "I just 
couldn't stand the idea of having to hold up my partner all around the dance 
floor. It was a wild place in those days." 
</P>
<P>
She did venture into the Big Stone a few times, she confessed, because it was 
one of the few places where young folks, or anyone else for that matter, could 
go to dance on a Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the wonderful hardwood dance floor there," she recalled. "It was so 
wonderfully smooth." 
</P>
<P>
Arie DeJong emigrated from Holland to Poway in 1949, along with his parents and 
nine brothers and sisters. They were sponsored by his father's brother-in-law, 
Uncle Sam, to work on his 800-acre dairy farm and they lived in several small 
stone houses in Wyoming Picnic Grove, south of the Big Stone Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't speak a word of English," DeJong said. "Every morning my brothers and 
I would get up about 2 in the morning to walk or ride our bikes to the dairy 
for the milking. We had to go right past that place and it was going strong at 
2 or 3 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was off-limits to us, of course," he said. Probably a wise ban, considering 
the English vocabulary he might have picked up at the rowdy roadhouse. 
</P>
<P>
But even before Big Stone Lodge earned its reputation as a wild, western dance 
hall in the 1920s, the site on a bend of Old Pomerado Road was a well-known 
watering hole for man and animal. Back in the 1870s and 1880s, the Twenty Mile 
House was in its heyday, according to Ernest Cravath, who interviewed Poway 
pioneers in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
One old-timer told Cravath about how, back in the 1880s, Daniel Dodson shot 
Henry Feeler dead in the Twenty Mile House, which Dodson ran. 
</P>
<P>
The story went like this: 
</P>
<P>
Dodson's "stepdaughter was a handsome blond girl who started going with Feeler 
and Dodson became jealous. Feeler walked into the Twenty Mile House bar one day 
and Dodson shot him through the heart with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
"Dodson pleaded self-defense. He claimed Feeler started to pull a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"At the coroner's inquest, the prosecuting attorney had the dead man's heart 
brought in in a pail as evidence. He hoped to demolish the self-defense plea by 
showing the direction of the bullet through the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept the pail in the anteroom, intending to produce it as a surprise, but 
hogs got into the room and devoured the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"At the trial, Dodson was set free." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years and under many names, the Big Stone Lodge has kept the 
reputation of its predecessors as a rough-and-tumble tavern with a 
country-western flavor. That flavor is something that Jerry Long hopes to 
preserve, but without the rowdyism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been five or 10 years now since there's been any problem here," Long 
said. "Back then, a bunch of bikers, Hell's Angels, discovered the place and 
took it over for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the roadhouse became a roadless house when the city of San Diego 
annexed a huge chunk of unincorporated land to the south of the Pomerado Club 
and closed the road as "unsafe" and "not up to city street standards." 
</P>
<P>
A new Pomerado Road, built to meet modern highway safety standards, is due to 
open any day now, but it won't help the Big Stone Lodge because it bypasses the 
former highway to the east, leaving the former stage route and federal highway 
a quiet cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
Long had 20 years' experience in food service with Service America Corp. (the 
firm that brought sushi to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium), rising to vice 
president in charge of operations in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I learned was, don't make something into what it's not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to reopen the restaurant at the roadhouse, but it won't be a fancy 
place. Just good Western food like steaks, chicken-fried steak and hamburgers. 
No white tableclothes or maitre d', Long said. "We're going to keep it simple 
and authentic." 
</P>
<P>
Long already has made many changes in the aging Big Stone and hired its former 
owners, the Savery Brothers, to provide live music. The Savery band is ranked 
at the top of the charts locally by country-western fans, Long bragged, and 
brings in fans from "all over the county, from Imperial Beach and Ramona, 
Lakeside and Encinitas." 
</P>
<P>
The new owner plans some incentives to bring in the people, including concerts 
and free dance lessons, "something for everyone, all age groups, but only in 
authentic country-western style." 
</P>
<P>
He also plans to "maybe expand on the history of this place" by building 
old-time western storefronts on the hill. "A blacksmith shop, for instance. And 
a little wedding chapel over by the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got 3.5 acres here, with a beautiful stream down there that runs 
year-round, and some 100-year-old oak trees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But mainly, Long is banking on over 100 years of history to fashion his new, 
old honky-tonk. As he puts it: "Go with what you've got."

JURY POOL QUIZZED FOR BRODERICK TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jury selection officially began Friday in Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick's 
double murder trial, as 117 potential jurors were asked to describe in three 
lines or less what circumstances might justify one person killing another. 
</P>
<P>
A 34-page, 150-question questionnaire -- an attempt to learn as much about the 
jury pool as possible -- also inquired about several other topics related to 
the case, such as whether jurors are divorced, object to vulgar language and 
believe lawyers are honest. 
</P>
<P>
It even delved into more sensitive material -- for instance, inquiring whether 
jurors "have strong feelings about abortion." 
</P>
<P>
The distribution of the lengthy forms signaled the official start of what San 
Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan announced was likely to be a 7-week 
trial. Over the next three weeks, hundreds more jurors are due to fill out the 
questionnaires -- and then undergo individual questioning -- before the two 
sides of the case are presented. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, faces two counts of murder in the shooting deaths last Nov. 5 of 
her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena 
Broderick. They were shot as they slept in their Marston Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and a former 
county bar president. 
</P>
<P>
During and after a bitter divorce, Betty accused Daniel of using his legal 
influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure income. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick confessed to the killings in a March interview in The Times. She said 
they were a "desperate act of self-defense" against a man who wanted to control 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, who pleaded not guilty, has been held without bail at the Las 
Colinas women's jail in Santee since last November. 
</P>
<P>
Before the questionnaires were passed out Friday, the jury pool was screened 
for people with financial hardships, medical disabilities or paid-for vacations 
in October or November, Whelan said. Anyone in those categories and students 
were excused, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 120 people who remained, three more were excused for work-related 
conflicts, including Linda Miller, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's 
office, who works with lead prosecutor Kerry Wells. 
</P>
<P>
The 117 who were left were given the questionnaire. Wells and defense lawyer 
Jack Earley prepared the form and while Whelan approved the questions, he did 
not write any of them. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the wealth of information the forms provide, they have become 
increasingly popular in complex cases. They also relieve the lawyers and judge 
in a case from the bother of asking each juror individually, in open court, the 
questions on the form -- in this case, 150 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a state appellate court in San Diego ruled in an unrelated 
case that jury questionnaires are part of the public record. Even though the 
forms may ask sensitive questions, the federal Constitution demands that the 
process of picking a jury be done in public, the 4th District Court of Appeal 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The Broderick case is the first high-profile trial to follow that rule. Whelan 
made the blank questionnaires available late Friday, after the 117 potential 
jurors had gone for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 150 questions, 11 were devoted to divorce. One asked, "How did you feel 
you were treated by the legal system during your divorce proceedings?" 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick contends Daniel Broderick manipulated the system to his benefit 
in their divorce. 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire does not indicate which side wrote which question. It is not 
clear, for instance, whether prosecutor Wells or defense attorney Earley asked 
the questions about vulgar language or abortion. 
</P>
<P>
After her first two children were born and before she bore two others, Betty 
Broderick had an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
According to court papers, Betty left vulgar messages about Linda on Daniel's 
answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire also asks, "Do you feel different about a woman's use of 
vulgar language than a man's?" 
</P>
<P>
It inquires whether jurors identify with "any ancestral or national heritage 
(such as French, English or Irish)." Daniel Broderick was Irish. 
</P>
<P>
It asks, "Whether you know any lawyers personally or not, what is your general 
opinion of lawyers?" 
</P>
<P>
It asks what opinions jurors have about the usefulness of testimony by 
psychiatrists or psychologists at criminal trials. In pretrial rulings, Whelan 
said Betty Broderick would be allowed to testify about anything related to her 
mental state before and after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
It asks, "How would you respond if you discovered your spouse or boyfriend (or) 
girlfriend was having an affair with someone else?" It says, "Describe the 
situation in your life where you feel you were treated the most unfairly." 
</P>
<P>
And it asks jurors to rank, on a scale, the honesty level of the following: 
state legislators, criminal defense attorneys, prosecutors, police departments, 
police officers, newspaper reporters, civil lawyers and judges. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Whelan warned Wells and Earley that they would not be allowed 
follow-up questions in open court on sensitive material. 
</P>
<P>
The answered forms are not yet available. They are due to be released as each 
potential juror is called for questioning, according to the 4th District Court.

4 LOST AS S.D. BOAT SINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
One man was rescued and four others are presumed dead after a San Diego fishing 
boat capsized off the coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia early 
Friday morning, Canadian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the crew of the Quicksilver was called off Friday afternoon 
after high seas and strong winds were deemed too dangerous for boats and 
aircraft involved and the chances for survival in the cold waters "improbable," 
according to Canadian officials involved in the search. 
</P>
<P>
"We've concluded that there's no probability of finding anybody alive," said 
Capt. Bruce McKay of the Canadian Air Force after 11 boats and two aircraft 
spent 15 hours searching for survivors. "It's sad, but it's the hard truth." 
</P>
<P>
The tuna boat Quicksilver issued a Mayday signal at 1:12 a.m. saying that the 
vessel was sinking, said Canadian Armed Forces Lt. Cmdr. Mike Considine. 
</P>
<P>
"The report said, basically, we're sinking and here's the position and the name 
of the vessel, and that's the last we heard from them," Considine said. 
</P>
<P>
Two airplanes and 11 boats in the area immediately responded to the distress 
signal but found only an inflated but empty life raft, Considine said. 
</P>
<P>
Four hours later, however, the San Diego fishing boat Defiant located Barry 
Holmberg who had stayed afloat with a life preserver, but was suffering "severe 
hypothermia" and was in shock after being rescued from the 54-degree water, 
said a Canadian Coast Guard officer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was alert and conscious," Considine said, noting that the water, while 
extremely cold, was warm for that area, where temperatures generally range from 
40 to 50 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The crew of the Defiant were in constant communication with the British 
Columbia Emergency Health Services, which gave advice on warming Holmberg, 
McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
"Holmberg is a remarkable man. His survival is quite phenomenal," said McKay. 
</P>
<P>
Holmberg was air-lifted from the Defiant to the Port Hardy Hospital where he 
was in stable condition in the emergency ward, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Perkins, manager of the Western Fishboat Owners Assn. in San Diego, said 
the rest of the crew consisted of the owner, Charlie Lagamma, and Bill Taylor, 
Manuel Falvala, and Holmberg's son, Rob. Lagamma and the Holmbergs are from the 
San Diego area; the residence of the other two was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Air Force Capt. McKay said that two people were spotted by the Defiant 
in the water with Holmberg, including his son, but neither wore life preservers 
and they both "slipped away" before rescuers could reach them. 
</P>
<P>
An interview with Holmberg revealed that the two others did not get off the 
vessel before it sank, McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to conduct these searches to the extent that we're willing to risk 
ourselves," McKay said shortly after the search was called off at 4 p.m. McKay 
said there are no plans to resume the search. 
</P>
<P>
Considine said the area was experiencing the first storms of the fall season, 
with winds gusting at 40 knots and waves up to 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rough weather out there, but it's not uncommon in the fall season," 
Considine said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Smoyer, manager of the High Seas Fuel Dock that services the Quicksilver 
when it's in San Diego, said the 70-foot steel-hull ship was used for fishing 
albacore and swordfish and was in good condition when it was last in port in 
July, just before traveling north. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real seaworthy boat," Smoyer said. "I wouldn't say that it was new, 
but Charlie (Lagamma) took good care of it and it was in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins of the Western Fishing Boat Assn. said he was surprised that the 
15-year-old boat capsized. 
</P>
<P>
"That boat's gone through hurricanes in the South Pacific, and Charlie's been 
fishing in (the Northwest) for years and years, and he's had a lot of 
experience in bad weather," Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins said Lagamma and his father, Frank, owned the boat and had been in the 
fishing business "all their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Quicksilver was one of about 35 boats in the area following the albacore, 
Perkins said.

<P>
A Thousand Oaks social studies teacher who conducts mock trials in her 
classroom -- with real attorneys and judges presiding -- has been named Ventura 
County teacher of the year, school officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Gorner of Colina Intermediate School was selected by a committee from the 
county superintendent's office from a field of four nominees, Assistant Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Weis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to make learning fun," Gorner, 52, said. "I don't ever want to be bored, 
and I don't want to bore my students." 
</P>
<P>
One of Gorner's favorite projects is to have students build medieval weapons 
and castles, and then quiz them about their historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-year veteran of teaching, Gorner has been in Thousand Oaks schools for 25 
years. She has been at Colina Intermediate School for 17 years and now oversees 
classes of seventh- and eighth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
She has taught English, Spanish, science, mathematics and home economics from 
elementary to high school grades. 
</P>
<P>
Colina Principal Michael Waters said students are excited by Gorner's spirited 
approach to history. 
</P>
<P>
"History is a story well-told, and she's the kind of person who can teach 
history as a story," Waters said. "Students just love her." 
</P>
<P>
Gorner has also participated in Conejo Valley Unified School District 
committees that offer tips to other teachers on how to improve instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't turned education upside down," Gorner said. "It's just innovations 
that I've made for my own classes, and people have picked them up." 
</P>
<P>
Gorner's name will be submitted to the state Department of Education as the 
county's nominee for Teacher of the Year, Weis said. The state announces the 
winner Oct. 31. PSYCHE PASCUAL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE PREVENTION OFFICE DESTROYED IN BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county fire prevention office in a building without sprinklers caught fire 
and burned west of downtown Los Angeles this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not embarrassing unless we find that something in our office caused the 
fire," said county Fire Capt. Robert Grafton. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no sprinklers in this building and it certainly would have been 
better to have them." 
</P>
<P>
The building may have been built before a sprinkler system was required, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's blaze caused $280,000 damage. 
</P>
<P>
"From time to time office buildings burn," Grafton said. "We think it's pretty 
unfortunate that it happened to us." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were alerted at about 9:55 p.m. They arrived to find the one-story 
building engulfed in flames, said city fire spokesman Pat Marek. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters had the blaze out in about 40 minutes, Marek said. There were 
no injuries and the building was empty, he said.

COORDINATOR HIRED FOR RECYCLING PLAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Moorpark City Council has not approved a curbside recycling 
program, the city has hired a coordinator to begin setting up the program, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Greene, a former consultant to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
and to the city of Beverly Hills, was hired earlier this month to begin putting 
together a recycling plan, said Susan Cauldwell, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, 44, was selected from 100 applicants and will be paid $33,648 a year, 
Cauldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Cauldwell said although the City Council has not approved a curbside recycling 
program, the city needed to hire Greene to set up a trash reduction plan. State 
law requires all cities to devise a plan by the end of the year to reduce the 
flow of trash into landfills by 25% within the next five years and by 50% 
before the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to approve a recycling program within the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Several other Ventura County cities, including Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, 
Fillmore and Ventura, have curbside programs in place. CARLOS V. LOZANO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people deserve to know the specific voting record of Congressman Elton 
Gallegly, and they deserve to hear a real debate between the incumbent 
congressman and his opponent, Richard Freiman. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents have huge advantages -- name recognition, money and access to the 
press. The people are the losers; they never hear anything negative about them. 
Gallegly's political letters, mailed to his constituents at taxpayers' expense, 
are carefully written to his advantage, never addressing anything 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Congressman Gallegly should accept Richard Freiman's invitation to debate. It's 
the democratic thing to do.

WOMEN TO SHARE CULTURAL TRADITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women of the world will bring their cultural traditions to Ventura next month, 
sharing everything from Mexican and Jewish foods to Indian hand painting and 
African dance. 
</P>
<P>
In three-hour classes offered Thursdays beginning this week, area women will 
explore new customs at the Barranca Vista Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when you are with someone from another culture, it opens up a whole 
new world," said Gienne Gabriels, an Ojai resident who organized the class. 
"Our culture is so rich in Southern California. We live with people from 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Gabriels said she developed the idea for her class after meeting women of other 
cultures. The city of Ventura is co-sponsoring the event and will receive half 
the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to just learn about each other, and this is my way of doing it," 
Gabriels said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the classes will be from 7 to 10 p.m. Thursdays at 7050 E. Ralston St. 
until Nov. 8. One will be 7 to 10 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 2. The fee is $40. 
</P>
<P>
Classes include: 
</P>
<P>
Thursday -- A Chumash Indian woman will share the history of her tribe, her 
language and songs. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 11 -- A woman of Mexican descent will share a Death Day celebration to 
honor ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 18 -- A professor at Ventura College who traveled to Africa will speak 
about her ancestors and share African dancing and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 25 -- An Indian woman will demonstrate traditional hand painting. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 2 -- Women will share a Shabbat meal, a Hebrew tradition, through song, 
food and candle lighting. This will be the only class held on a Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 8 -- Gabriels will lead a celebration of friendship. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A masked man brandishing a 20-gauge shotgun took over an Oxnard bank Friday 
morning, robbing three tellers and then leading police on a 20-minute car chase 
through residential areas, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police arrested Tony Ray, 33, of Oxnard on suspicion of armed robbery, 
said Gary Auer of the FBI's Ventura bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Ray could face up to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
At about 10 a.m., a gunman entered Security Pacific Bank, 606 N. Ventura Road, 
wearing what looked like a rubber Ronald Reagan mask. He went behind the 
tellers' row and deposited money into a duffel bag, Sgt. Denny Phillips of the 
Oxnard Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
When a customer, one of about 17 people in the bank, questioned the 
authenticity of his gun, the man ejected a cartridge on the floor, Phillips 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman also hit a customer with the gun, Auer added, although no one was 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
After someone outside the bank called the police, five patrol cars arrived in 
time to watch the robber jump into a car. The police chased the car through 
residential areas at speeds of more than 80 m.p.h. for about 20 minutes until a 
rear tire blew out while the car rounded a curve in the 2100 block of Lantana 
Street, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Two police cars were damaged in the pursuit when one ran into the other while 
making an abrupt turn, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
After the robbery, the bank closed for the remainder of the day, Phillips said.

MAN, SON TO FACE ANIMAL ABUSE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET BERGAMO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Piru man and his son were bound over for trial on charges of felony animal 
abuse after a motion to suppress evidence was denied by Municipal Judge John J. 
Hunter during a preliminary hearing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred (Dale) Beem and his son Robert are scheduled to be tried in Superior 
Court on Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers sought to eliminate testimony and pictures taken by Ventura 
County Humane Society officers and a sheriff's deputy because they seized more 
than 100 emaciated horses, sheep and rabbits from corrals on Piru Canyon Road 
without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter ruled that while there was no precedent declaring animal neglect an 
emergency, Deputy Todd Hawley's observations gave officers probable cause to 
enter the property, and their actions were proper since "exigent circumstances" 
do not require a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a place of chaos," Hunter said as he examined pictures of the site. 
"There is sufficient cause to believe the defendants may be guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence was also given by Beem's younger son Michael, who testified although 
Hunter warned him that he could incriminate himself by answering questions from 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pachowicz. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Beem said all the animals were in fair condition when he left the 
Piru Canyon residence on April 20 to care for his grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarian Betsy Connolly testified that the animals' deterioration from fair 
to starved condition must have occurred within a few months before they were 
impounded by the Humane Society May 31. JANET BERGAMO

DEMOCRACY ON THE BEACH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside Magazine in its June, 1989 edition called the beach "a fine and 
democratic place compared with the rest of the world." Obviously, had the 
editors stopped in to visit Ventura this past summer, they would have had to 
put an asterisk next to that statement and refer the reader to the fact that in 
Ventura that statement does not apply, as evidenced by this past summer beach 
recreation destruction. 
</P>
<P>
First, the state makes the brilliant decision to tear out the bike path at the 
beginning of summer. Shortly thereafter they followed that stunt up by ripping 
out yet another recreational entity, the "dreaded volleyball court." 
</P>
<P>
As I fought my battle this summer to get a healthy, recreational entity 
returned to the city beaches and its people, I soon became aware that yes 
indeed, all of the dirtiest decisions are done behind closed doors at a 
location know as City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, my plea to get volleyball courts returned to Pierpoint Beach now lies in 
the hands of a yet to be started environmental impact report paid for by who 
else but the taxpayers of this city. 
</P>
<P>
I thought I had a really good chance of winning back the courts, but I found 
out that the concept of strength in numbers plays no role in Ventura politics. 
While I presented the City Council and park commissioners with more than 1,000 
signatures in favor of volleyball's return to the beach, all they presented me 
was a single letter of disapproval signed by only a single person. At both 
public hearings, a number of people spoke out in favor of the courts' return, 
yet in both instances not one person spoke out in disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
The city has enough problems without wasting money on destroying recreation. It 
also has a gang problem which this past summer has only continued to escalate. 
The youth in this city need more recreational choices -- not fewer. By taking 
away pre-existing entities, the city is only helping to contribute to the 
problem. Once again they proved to the general public that no one in City Hall 
knows what the hell he or she is doing.

THE RIGHT KIND OF OFFICIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Reading a recent article about City Councilwoman Cathy Bean, I was reminded of 
a quote I read of something Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said: "If you want 
something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman." 
</P>
<P>
I think Councilwoman Bean is making some people very uncomfortable with her 
persistent questioning of the way things are, the way things are "always done." 
Maybe men can comfortably assume they know everything and be admired, but women 
-- and especially women who have been active in the League of Women Voters -- 
want to really know. And that's the kind of person I want serving me on the 
City Council.

I finally cooled down enough to write concerning your ineptitude in covering

<P>
I seriously do not believe you even know where to secure most of it; e.g., when 
was the last time you listed a Ventura County bankruptcy in the business 
section? You always list San Diego County or San Bernardino County, but never 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
When was the last time you published a stamp collector's column? Or a genealogy 
column such as "Climbing Your Family's Tree."

And where are all the events going on in Simi Valley and at the general east

FEES MAY BE RAISED FOR PLANNING PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN MCKEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Planning Commission has proposed increasing planning permit fees, 
which could cost developers thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed resolution would allow the city to recover 75% of the cost of 
providing a permit or reviewing a development request, Senior Planner Karen 
Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Planning Department does not charge for services such as parking 
approval, ordinance amendments or comprehensive plan amendments, which would be 
needed to change zoning from industrial to residential, for example, so that a 
housing development could be built. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, an applicant for a comprehensive plan amendment 
would pay $2,800 of the $3,722 that officials say it costs the city to process 
the permit. Parking approval would cost an applicant $1,000, and an ordinance 
amendment would cost $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the Planning Department shows that the city performs 200 sign 
reviews a year for businesses that want to change or add signs. It costs the 
city $175, but the applicant pays $20. Although 75% of the cost would be about 
$135, Bates said the city has decided that amount might deter business owners 
from applying for the review. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a lot of trouble getting business people to install signs that 
meet city codes, and we figure that keeping the fee at $50 will be incentive 
for them to get the permit," Bates said. KAREN MCKEAN

BROKEN PIPELINE BRINGS REQUEST TO CUT WATER USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 84-inch water pipeline that feeds several reservoirs broke Friday in Scripps 
Ranch, forcing the County Water Authority to ask hundreds of thousands of East 
County residents to curtail water use over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoirs fed by the pipeline had about three days of storage capacity 
when the break occurred, and spigots are not expected to go dry, said County 
Water Authority spokesman Greg Starmack. However, a statement put out by the 
agency said the break could take from three to seven days to repair. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their optimism about the availability of water, officials asked local 
water agencies that buy water from the pipeline "to take necessary emergency 
water conservation measures." 
</P>
<P>
The County Water Authority also warned residents in several communities against 
"outdoor and non-essential water usage" over the weekend. The communities asked 
to ration water are La Mesa, El Cajon, Lakeside, Santee, Spring Valley, Lemon 
Grove and Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative that they do this," Starmack said. 
</P>
<P>
Starmack said the broken pipe, which carries treated water purchased from the 
Metropolitan Water District, normally feeds about 10 reservoirs located south 
of the Mira Mar area. The water is pumped from Lake Skinner in the Temecula 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were waiting for the pipe to drain Friday afternoon before beginning to 
excavate. The cause of the break of the cement pipe, constructed in the 
mid-1970s, was unknown, Starmack said. 
</P>
<P>
Starmack said the break occurred at 2 p.m. near Waldgrove Place and Ironwood 
Road. However, Irma Warner, who lives on Ironwood Road, said she reported the 
break around noon and added that a neighbor had reported it 45 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Water was running down a drainage ditch and I knew that wasn't normal. I also 
saw gushing water coming out of the utility easement. I called the city water 
department and they were puzzled because they didn't know where the water was 
coming from. They decided it was the county's responsibility. Ultimately it was 
the county that came to turn it off," Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that water flowed into back yards and muddied some swimming pools but 
damage appeared to be minor.

SLOW PACE OF CIVIL JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Courting a Credibility Problem," editorial (Sept. 17) and "L.A. 
Civil Justice Heads for Gridlock," Commentary (Sept. 14): 
</P>
<P>
Recent publication of the RAND report, "Averting Gridlock: Strategies for 
Reducing Civil Delay in the Los Angeles Superior Court" and Times articles and 
editorials about the report have focused attention on the problems I and the 
other Superior Court judges confront daily. 
</P>
<P>
The RAND report correctly concludes that our court needs many more judges and 
additional funding to handle our staggering caseload. However, I'm somewhat 
disappointed that the report is based upon old (pre-1985) data and makes only 
passing reference to delay reduction programs we have initiated in the past 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Let me cite two examples. Since Jan. 1, 1988, the Superior Court has operated 
an expedited "fast track" pilot program aimed at speeding the pace of civil 
litigation. Twenty-five judges in the downtown courthouse handle all aspects of 
a civil case from initial filing to resolution, and require cases to conform to 
specific time standards. This program has been noticeably successful in 
reducing time to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, last year the Superior Court established seven "speedy trial" 
criminal courts in which judicial officers handling felony cases are relieved 
of their calendars and devote their workday to trying death penalty and other 
complex cases. 
</P>
<P>
These and other programs designed to improve case management have been helpful, 
but they can only go so far to deal with the problem. The need for more judges 
has been recognized for years. The RAND report reiterates this view and sets 
the number at 106. In the face of exploding caseloads, the Legislature has only 
added 14 judges to our court since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to obtain additional funding have also been difficult. The Trial Court 
Funding Act of 1987 provided some state assistance to trial courts and counties 
for the last two years. However, these funds have been insufficient to meet our 
needs and were cut back this year because of the $3.6-billion state budget 
shortfall. As a result, the Superior Court budget for this fiscal year was 
reduced by $8.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The RAND report is right on target when it concludes that we need more judges 
and better funding to do the job.

MPAA NIXES X, PREVIEWS NC-17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The movie industry made Hollywood history the other day. It left on the 
cutting-room floor the dreaded silver-screen scarlet letter: the controversial 
X rating. Cheering was heard all over town. 
</P>
<P>
Films with themes too adult for R (Restricted) will no longer be dumped in the 
X bag -- long associated with blue movies. The Motion Picture Assn. of America 
simply replaced X with a new NC-17 rating -- No children under 17 admitted. The 
change neatly defused challenges to a recent spate of X ratings pinned to 
movies that, while clearly marketed at adults, hardly deserved to be lumped in 
the same sordid category as, say, "Debbie Does Dallas." Indeed, the whole point 
of the new, copyrighted NC-17 rating is to free movies with strong adult themes 
from the pornographic stigma of X. Irate producers and directors had begged for 
an alternative rating so their films could secure a lettered label acceptable 
to theater owners, who typically do not show unrated or X films. 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA also added a most useful requirement for providing written 
explanations to R-rated films (under 17 must be accompanied by an adult) to 
indicate what it is in the film that's a problem -- whether violence, explicit 
language or sex. 
</P>
<P>
But, for all this, has the MPAA gone far enough? 
</P>
<P>
The criteria for assigning an NC-17 rating is the same as it had been for the 
now banished X film. One has to wonder whether it leaves the door open for 
pornography to seek legitimacy by securing a NC-17 rating. No, says Jack 
Valenti, president of the MPAA, who maintains that the hard-core pornography 
theater business is "extinct as far as we're concerned" because it is now 
largely a video business. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. Valenti's intent is to return the adults-only category back to the 
days when it embraced films such as "Midnight Cowboy," "Last Tango in Paris" 
and "A Clockwork Orange." A noble attempt. Let's hope it works. 
</P>
<P>
And let's hope movie theaters assiduously monitor whom they're selling tickets 
to. There may not be many X-rated films in theaters. But there are a lot of 
teens going to films. Thus the code's enforcement is key.

THE WAR IS OVER; 
</P>
<P>
IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH HANOI WILL REQUIRE PATIENCE AND PRAGMATISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington's recent efforts to forge a meaningful dialogue with Hanoi get a 
welcome boost with the scheduled sit-down in New York City today between 
Secretary of State of James A. Baker III and Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach. 
It marks the fourth meeting between U.S. and Vietnamese officials since July. 
Talks with Hanoi then were prompted by the desire to end the 12-year-old 
Cambodian conflict. Perhaps the Cold War with Hanoi will thaw even more today 
when Cabinet level officials from the United States and Vietnam meet for the 
first time since the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Hanoi and Washington have a long list of issues to talk about. Baker wants to 
acknowledge and discuss the progress made toward a settlement in Cambodia, 
including the acceptance of a United Nations peace plan and the formation of a 
Cambodian National Supreme Council. Such a new Cambodian government, composed 
of Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen, and the three opposition parties, would assume 
the country's U.N. seat. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also will press Thach to be more forthcoming about the fates of more than 
2,400 Americans missing since the Vietnam War. Some Americans fervently believe 
that 1,700 of that number might still be -- or at least had been -- within the 
territory of Vietnam itself. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution of the MIA issue has been one of three conditions that Washington 
has insisted Hanoi fulfill before better relations. A second one is for Hanoi 
to help work out some solution to the heartbreaking Vietnamese refugee problem. 
But the third condition has already been met: Hanoi has withdrawn its troops 
from Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's cooperation, so far, has helped to bring Hun Sen to the bargaining 
table. It is important to recognize that contribution and encourage Hanoi to do 
more of the same. Baker's meeting might go quite a way toward doing just that. 
The secretary of state's penchant for pragmatism is widely noted. That's 
exactly the tone that needs to prevail in these talks.

DEBATE OVER OWLS AND TIMBER IN NORTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your backhanded attempt to equate loggers with the production of weapons is 
both cowardly and typical. 
</P>
<P>
And your statement that loggers can be retrained and re-employed shows a 
callous disregard for the families affected. 
</P>
<P>
No one has a greater love for animals and trees than I, but I reject the 
elitist notion that they have equal rights with humans. The ultimate goal of 
environmental activists is a total ban on timber harvesting. One can only hope 
that common sense will someday be the rule and not the exception.

DEBATE OVER OWLS AND TIMBER IN NORTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regards to your editorial on forest management, please be more careful. The 
issue is in fact better management of our forest resources. The issue is not 
addressed in any productive manner by emotion-charged, attention-grabbing 
editorials! 
</P>
<P>
We are not running out of trees! We in the U.S. have had great success in 
harvesting and renewing our forest lands. Current estimates are that we have up 
to 70% of the trees that the country had when the Americas were discovered. The 
industry has for many years planted four to five times the trees it harvests. 
</P>
<P>
When will the ancient forest be cut down? Never! We have already set aside the 
best of the best forever. Not just in the well-known parks like Yellowstone and 
Yosemite, but in the seldom-traveled and remote millions and millions of acres 
of our state and federal park and wilderness systems, 12 million acres (12% of 
the land base) in California alone! 
</P>
<P>
Of the great California redwoods, the giant redwoods of the Sierra are for the 
most part totally protected from all but nature itself. Of the smaller, 
commercial specie, the coastal redwood, the protected forest lands are so large 
(more than 255,000 acres) that if consolidated in one strip, it would be 1 mile 
wide and stretch from Los Angeles to San Francisco (more than 375 square 
miles). Already preserved in Redwood National Park, the least visited of all 
the national parks, are the tallest and some of the oldest of the coastal 
redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
Can we do a better job of managing the forests and protecting the environment? 
We can never stop trying to be better at it. What we need is more responsible 
efforts. That's why we should not support Prop. 130 or Prop. 128. They don't 
offer a reasoned and responsible approach. We need to vote yes on Prop. 138 for 
reasonable forest management and responsible protection of the environment.

UNFAN-LIKE CONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fans who would like to savor Los Angeles Raiders games without showing up at 
the Coliseum with bodyguards -- or first completing bodybuilding or Tae Kwon Do 
training programs -- perhaps can breathe a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum says he has had 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
So have the police. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday a fan rooting for the opposing Pittsburgh Steelers was given a 
severe beating by Raider fans, or fan. (One alleged assailant has been arrested 
but the investigation is continuing.) 
</P>
<P>
By the time security officials reached the scene, the 35-year-old Tucson 
resident had to be taken to the hospital. As a result of this vicious and 
unacceptable incident, Coliseum policy is to be toughened, effective Sunday at 
the Chicago Bears game. Violent spectators will now be subject to arrest by 
police, not just banishment from the stands. Fans entering the stadium will be 
screened by police for drunkenness. The sales of alcoholic beverages will be 
closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
One hopes the new policy will curb the ruffians who would spoil the game for 
the rest of the fans. Fan violence is not a new phenomenon, but until now its 
prevalence has seemed largely the predilection of some American hockey and many 
English soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
The thought that someone might even lose his life -- the Tucson victim briefly 
sank into a frightening coma -- while watching a football game is chilling. The 
game on the field is brutal enough without people in the stands behaving like 
prehistoric beasts.

Your editorial "The Spotted Owl Is No Pussycat" (Sept. 20) was very 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Forest management must return to a sustainable yield harvest for the benefit of 
all citizens. In the 1970s, the timber industry, successfully backed by Oregon 
Sen. Mark Hatfield and other Northwest lawmakers, won legislation allowing the 
national forests to violate their longstanding policy of cutting only as much 
as they could cut for perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
The spotted owl, marbled murrelet, martin and myriad other species are merely a 
scapegoat for the cover-up of two decades of mismanagement and greed.

AMERICANS HAVE PATIENCE TO LET INTERNATIONAL ACTION SUCCEED; 
</P>
<P>
GULF: A 'WAR PARTY' IN WASHINGTON THREATENS TO UNDO WHAT IT TOOK THE UNITED 
NATIONS 45 YEARS TO ACHIEVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY DAY, Anthony Day is senior correspondent for The Times. His 
commentary is adapted from a speech he will give at the International Senior 
Citizens Assn. convention Monday in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The men and women who have kept alive the world's hopes for the United Nations 
through these last 45 years of tribulations and trials have done a singular 
service. Now their hopes are gradually being realized, at least in part. 
</P>
<P>
For 45 years the Cold War vastly restricted the power of the United Nations to 
do what its founders hoped for -- chiefly, to establish a world order of peace 
and responsibility, in which the rule of law and international cooperation 
would replace the old order of brute force. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Cold War is over. The United Nations has taken on new vigor. It has 
been functioning more effectively than it had in years. 
</P>
<P>
And now in the Persian Gulf it faces a most difficult challenge. The five 
permanent members of the Security Council have acted repeatedly, with 
unprecedented unanimity and the support of nearly all the council's other 
members, to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and to impose tough sanctions 
with the object of getting Iraq to relinquish Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
This is the principal object for which the United Nations was founded: to 
establish an international order where once had been only the law of the 
jungle. 
</P>
<P>
It is an exhilarating spectacle to watch. It is also sobering, because it is 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
It is dangerous first because Saddam Hussein is dangerous. We all know the 
stories: He came to power through assassination; he has maintained his power by 
murder and ferocious repression; he not only attacked Iran and Kuwait, he also 
slaughtered his own Kurdish people with poison gas -- and, some say, his own 
soldiers, deserters in the war against Iran. He has amassed a great war machine 
and he is racing to build nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in the gulf is dangerous also because the presence of so many 
heavily armed opponents can lead to accidents, to sparks that could set off a 
great fire no one could control. 
</P>
<P>
And it is dangerous because there exists in the United States a war party that 
is either assuming that war is inevitable or hoping that it is. 
</P>
<P>
The war party's argument goes something like this: Sanctions will not persuade 
Hussein to leave Kuwait, because Iraq will be able to withstand their effects 
for months or even years -- at least longer than the American people will 
tolerate the tension, and the expense, of keeping so many of their young men 
and women stationed in the Arabian desert. The international cooperation shown 
to date is actually fragile, and cannot stand a long, inconclusive period of 
uncertainty. In any case, the war party's argument goes, Hussein, if unchecked, 
will only become more dangerous. Therefore, the argument goes, the United 
States should either seize upon the least provocation, or create one, to attack 
Iraq, Hussein and his military, chemical and nuclear installations. Finally, 
this can be accomplished swiftly, and almost entirely with air power. 
</P>
<P>
That line of reasoning is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
First, it is foolish to count on air power, and air power alone. A war with 
Iraq would involve troops on the ground -- very many of them -- and there would 
be many, many casualties. 
</P>
<P>
And it is impossible to predict what will happen once a war gets under way. 
Wars have unintended, indeed unimagined consequences. A war with Iraq in which 
the United States played the leading role of antagonist would threaten the 
United Nations consensus. It would seriously threaten, if not destroy, the 
anti-Iraq stance of most of the Arab states. It would present the containment 
of Iraq, which is currently a United Nations endeavor, as an attack by the 
infidel Christian West against a Muslim Arab state. It would throw the Arab 
world into further turmoil, with all sorts of upheavals, in Saudi Arabia, for 
instance, or Egypt. It would at least for a while disrupt the world's supplies 
of oil much more seriously than they are disrupted now. 
</P>
<P>
In short, a war with Iraq in which the United States played the leading role 
would gravely set back the cause of international order. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of Saddam Hussein, (and threats to peace from future Saddam 
Husseins), is better contained by international than by unilateral American 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the outcome may not lie in the hands of the United States or its 
allies. It may be that Hussein by his own unmistakably belligerent acts will 
precipitate a war. In that case, the international response, and the 
predominant Arab response, may well hold together in opposition to him. 
</P>
<P>
But suppose Hussein does not precipitate a war, and suppose the war party in 
Washington -- and in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt and perhaps in Israel -- is 
restrained. Is the world then condemned to watch helplessly as Hussein grows in 
power and arrogance, until he is able to unleash the horror of not only 
chemical weapons but also nuclear weapons against Israel? To use nuclear 
blackmail against Saudi Arabia and the oil states of the gulf, Egypt and the 
Western allies? 
</P>
<P>
The preponderance of evidence is against these assumptions. It is true that the 
world in general and the United States -- and France -- in particular, not to 
mention Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- have much blame to bear for letting Hussein 
think that he could act pretty much as he wanted to, not only without 
opposition, but indeed with support. Surely he is disabused of that notion now. 
</P>
<P>
And it is by no means certain that the sanctions will not have a severe effect 
on Iraq, especially on its more sophisticated war-making machine. The lack of 
parts and the lack of imported skills and materials will, some people believe, 
seriously crimp Iraq's ambitions to build an even more sophisticated engine of 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
It has been argued, variously, that an international force under U.N. command 
could be held in the desert indefinitely, in order to allow the United States 
to withdraw the bulk of its ground troops while keeping its air and sea power 
there in conjunction, as now, with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, such a course would not immediately solve the problem of Kuwait. 
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait should remain the United Nations' unequivocal 
position, even though it may take some time to bring that about. 
</P>
<P>
It is often said -- by American commentators -- that the American people will 
not put up with a long struggle whose outcome is indistinct and whose purpose 
is unclear. It is said that the American military force now in the desert must 
be used soon, or the people will demand that it be brought home -- a cynical 
"use it or lose it" point of view. 
</P>
<P>
I don't believe that. I believe the American people will support a long 
struggle -- if the purpose is clear, and clearly worthy. After all, the United 
States has spent a vast fortune and kept several hundred thousands of men and 
women at arms overseas over the last 45 years in defense of the freedom of our 
own and other peoples. A long but much smaller watch in the Persian Gulf, in 
the service of the international order, is a task the people would support if 
the elected leaders have the courage to ask for it, the intelligence to explain 
it and the moderation to make it fit the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that this first post-Cold War attempt at international cooperation 
will quite literally blow up through miscalculation, or, worse, by calculation. 
If it does not, if it is sustainable by the international community, then the 
human species will have taken another faltering but forward step toward 
organizing itself on rational principles for the benefit of everyone. 
</P>
<P>
None of us should feel smug in our belief that despite the horrors of this 
ghastly century there is such a thing as progress in human affairs. But those 
who have supported the concept of the United Nations through its darker and 
more ineffectual days may take some small satisfaction in seeing that a more 
orderly and united world is still struggling to be born.

OIL'S ROLE IN PERSIAN GULF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our soldiers are in the Middle East to secure next year's oil at this year's 
prices for last year's cars. 
</P>
<P>
The cost could be terrible. After this is past, let's all do our best to assure 
that, when the next crisis happens, "last year's cars" are more efficient. Buy 
smart; vote smart.

GRUMBLE OF PROTEST OVER PRICE OF CIVIC CENTER BECOMES A HOWL; 
</P>
<P>
ESCONDIDO: NEW ESTIMATE PUSHES COST OF PROJECT -- ORIGINALLY PUT AT $52 MILLION 
-- TO $74.3 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Escondido residents approved a redevelopment district to finance a 
$52-million civic and cultural center in 1985, it was not without quite a bit 
of grumbling over the price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Now that designers have "refined" cost estimates for the center, that grumbling 
has become a howl. 
</P>
<P>
That $52-million estimate, which some believe included the $17-million City 
Hall completed in 1988, grew to $63.7 million earlier this year, and now is at 
$73.4 million -- a figure that raises the eyebrows of even the staunchest of 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent cost estimates, released this week, were defended by Marilyn 
Whisenand, executive director of the the city Community Development Commission, 
as "not out of line with other, similar facilities." 
</P>
<P>
But Escondido Councilman Kris Murphy said he is "both surprised and concerned 
at these new cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we, the council, had pinned down the cost of the center. It was my 
understanding that when we accepted a $63.7-million figure for the center 
earlier this year, that that was it. It was a cap. It was frozen at that 
amount." 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of tough questions to be asked and we need to hear from the 
community, see how they feel about this," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what the City Council will do, ask questions of their community 
development staff and listen to the people express their opinions on what 
should be done -- scale down the project or boost the budget -- at a workshop 
scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Wednesday in the new City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural center plan endorsed by voters in 1985 included a large 
amphitheater, a 2,500-seat Lyric Theater, a 400-seat community playhouse, and 
800-capacity conference center and a visual arts center containing galleries, a 
library wing and studios, something for every cultural taste in the super-block 
between Escondido Boulevard and Broadway, north of Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the amphitheater was scratched from the plans and in 1987, 
the Lyric Theater was reduced to 1,500 seats. In recent weeks, a citizens 
committee studied the project and suggested, if the additional funds could not 
be found, deferring construction of the meeting center (a savings of $4.1 
million), postponing purchase of the smaller community theater's equipment ($1 
million savings) or deferring construction of the studio and library wing of 
the art center ($1.5 million savings). 
</P>
<P>
Whisenand and her staff already have made about $1 million in deferrals and are 
recommending that the council, sitting as CDC commissioners, authorize the 
entire construction package go out for bid in mid-November, then make any 
needed cuts before bids are awarded in mid-January, thus avoiding an immediate 
confrontation with the city's different arts and business factions, each 
willing to fight for its favorite pieces of the cultural center pie. 
</P>
<P>
"There couldn't be a better time to go out to bid than now," Whisenand said. 
"The economy is soft right now and there are a lot of contractors out there 
looking for work. Possibly we may get some very favorable bids." 
</P>
<P>
Inflation, geologic problems and escalating costs of equipment for the two 
center theaters are the chief reasons for the most recent jump in price for the 
four-unit cultural center, Whisenand said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-seat Lyric Theater and the 400-seat Patio Playhouse will require 
steel pilings instead of cheaper pre-cast concrete underpinnings, she 
explained. Also, the prices of mechanical, electrical and plumbing components 
of the two theaters have risen rapidly because the demand for cultural 
complexes has escalated, adding $4 million of the $5.6 million in construction 
cost increases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis said she had "several reservations about the 
cultural center. Most importantly, can we afford it and can we afford to 
maintain it? However, I would guess that we will agree to continue to design it 
and go out to bid and see what the bids come back as, then decide which way to 
go from there. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go back now and have the architects redo the project, it will end up 
costing us more," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
DeDominicis and Mayor Jerry Harmon are charged with overseeing the cultural 
center progress for the City Council, so the cost increase did not come as a 
surprise to her. "Not only the construction costs but the cost of maintaining 
it are a concern," she said, explaining that there are estimates that the 
center's annual maintenance bill could exceed its yearly revenues by as much as 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, the only council incumbent who was in office when the cultural arts 
center was being planned and discussed, was out of town and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Cowan, a veteran on the Escondido council until he was defeated last 
June, remembers that the $52-million figure given to voters in 1985 "was just a 
rough estimate and people knew that it was going to go up. 
</P>
<P>
"We (on the council) knew that we would be having to make choices, but I didn't 
want to do it just for the sake of economy. In a lot of things, you get what 
you pay for. I remember that on the City Hall, we decided to buy some 
exorbitantly expensive paint, not the cheaper stuff, because it meant the 
difference between having to paint the building every two or three years or 
having to paint it only once in 15 years," Cowan explained. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce drastically the size and functions in the proposed cultural center 
"would be like doing open heart surgery on the city. We need this center as the 
centerpiece of downtown revitalization. It's good for the entire community and 
I hope that the council is not be swayed by naysayers," Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan added, however, that he was not opposed to phased construction of the 
cultural center buildings over several years as the funds became available. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Sid Hollins, who was elected to the council in June, took a 
wait-and-see attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to hear what the people have to say about this and I am concerned that 
if we only have two or three hours, not everyone will have a chance to speak. 
We may have to schedule another session," Hollins said. 
</P>
<P>
Hollins also said he was concerned that no cuts be made which would decrease 
the center's popularity and usability. 
</P>
<P>
"If the center isn't used, we're in trouble," Hollins commented. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Murphy, despite his concern over the increased cost estimates, 
conceded that: "This is a good project for the city and a much-needed one, but 
affordability is the bottom line."

<TEXT>
<P>
Ralph E. Duewer, a retired Glendale bank manager, died Thursday of cancer at 
his home in La Canada, said his stepdaughter, Christie Alexander. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
Born Sept. 13, 1915, in Morgan County, Ill., Duewer graduated from Illinois 
College in 1937 and moved to California in 1940. He retired in 1977 as vice 
president and manager of the Glendale branch of Security Pacific National Bank. 
His career with the bank was interrupted twice when he left to serve in the 
U.S. Army during World War II and the Korean War, achieving the rank of 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
Duewer was a member of various Kiwanis clubs, including the Glendale chapter; 
the Glendale Chamber of Commerce; and the Verdugo Club. He served on the board 
of directors of Glendale Adventist Medical Center for many years and was 
recently acknowledged on their Wall of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 38 years, Ruth Duewer; stepdaughter Christie 
Alexander of South Pasadena; and a step-grandson and step-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Peace Chapel of 
Kiefer &amp; Eyerick Mortuary, 314 E. Harvard St. in Glendale. Burial will be 
private. Donations can be made in Duewer's name to the Boys Republic, Chino, 
Calif. 91709, or the Glendale Adventist Medical Center Foundation.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CALARTS STUDENT, 21, HELD IN BURGLARY SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A CalArts student wanted on charges of breaking into a safe in Michigan was 
arrested in his dormitory room on the Valencia campus by investigators who also 
found property from five Simi Valley burglaries, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Wesley Hicks, 21, was arrested Thursday night and was being held without 
bail because of a warrant charging him with safe breaking and embezzlement in 
Charlotte, Mich., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks was arrested by members of a Sheriff's Department anti-burglary team 
based in the Santa Clarita Valley. The deputies located Hicks with information 
from Simi Valley police, who were investigating a series of commercial 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Detective Christopher Ward said Hicks is believed to have 
been involved in numerous burglaries in Los Angeles and Simi Valley. He said he 
will ask the Ventura County district attorney to file five burglary charges 
against Hicks stemming from break-ins at four restaurants and one motel in 
which about $9,000 in cash and property were taken. Property from those 
burglaries was found in Hicks' dorm room, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said Hicks enrolled at the school this year, but it was unknown what he 
was studying because school officials declined to release information about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
He was identified as a burglary suspect last week when Simi Valley police 
arrested 29-year-old Tambra Lipps as she was attempting to break into the Oak 
Pit Restaurant in the 3200 block of Los Angeles Avenue, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Lipps told police she had been taught how to break into businesses by Hicks, 
whom she had met at a Simi Valley boarding house, Ward said. She allegedly told 
police that Hicks was attending college in Valencia.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORMER DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY GETS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former deputy city attorney was sentenced Friday to a year in Los Angeles 
County Jail for offering to help an 18-year-old woman accused of forgery obtain 
a lighter sentence in exchange for sexual favors. 
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
George Schwartz, 43, a 10-year veteran of the city attorney's office, also was 
placed on five years probation and fined $500 by Superior Court Judge Judith 
Chirlin. 
</P>
<P>
Chirlin ruled that Schwartz could remain free on bail while he appeals his 
conviction on one count of soliciting a bribe, but ordered him to surrender his 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz was convicted by a jury on June 4 of promising a lighter sentence to 
defendant Laura Kazemi, who was then 18, if she agreed to have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
Kazemi was charged in Van Nuys court with forgery and receiving stolen 
property, but Schwartz told her that, in exchange for sex, he would ask the 
judge to sentence her to perform community service rather than serve jail time. 
</P>
<P>
According to evidence presented at the trial, Kazemi notified her lawyer and 
Schwartz's supervisors of Schwartz's offer. Police were then contacted and 
arranged to have Kazemi meet with Schwartz on Aug. 23 and Aug. 24, 1988, at his 
tanning salon in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kazemi wore a concealed recording device which recorded their 
conversation, during which Schwartz repeated his offer. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz was arrested Aug. 25, 1988, and later fired from his job. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges against Kazemi were subsequently dropped. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial this summer, Schwartz's attorney argued that the prosecutor 
never intended to have sex with Kazemi and that she pursued him in efforts to 
obtain leniency on her case.

CLARK BLAMES GWYNN FOR . . . EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Padre first baseman Jack Clark on Friday blamed Tony Gwynn for most of the 
club's troubles this season, publicly chastising the four-time batting 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Padres' 2-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds, Clark also said he 
will demand a trade if he is forced into salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
In what was nothing less than a character assassination, Clark said that unless 
the Padres trade Gwynn or alter his personality in the clubhouse, they will 
continue to be a losing organization. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Clark made public his feelings about Gwynn. Clark berated 
Gwynn for being what he perceives as selfishness. He berated Gwynn for wanting 
his contract renegotiated. He berated Gwynn for allowing his wife to speak 
publicly about him. And most of all, he berated Gwynn for his recent comments 
in The Times and Escondido Times-Advocate that were critical of his teammates' 
attitude toward him. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be interesting to see how we're supposed to react to Tony after all of 
this, " Clark said, "how we're supposed to involve ourselves with Tony, after 
he ripped us and took a hike. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see if he directed it at just me, but he directed it at the team in 
general. How the hell are we supposed to feel after that? He could have come 
back and tried to explain himself, but he just said it and took a hike. 
</P>
<P>
"I can handle it personally. Me and him don't get along anyway. We never have. 
But to say that about everyone, especially the young teammates, how are they 
supposed to act? 
</P>
<P>
"You hear all this talk about Mr. Padre, Mr. San Diego, and all that crap, I 
just want to laugh. I don't think anyone's going to respect him after this. 
</P>
<P>
"He made his bed, now let him sleep in it." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, according to one of his teammates, telephoned to let them know that he 
indeed was directing his anger at a select group of players. The player did not 
want to be identified or specify the players Gwynn was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, reached at his Poway home where he's recuperating from a fractured 
finger, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who considered Gwynn a selfish player when they began playing together 
in 1988, said Gwynn's contract is the root of his problems. Gwynn, who earns $1 
million, was reduced to the seventh-highest-paid player on the payroll after 
the signings of Joe Carter and Craig Lefferts and the arbitration award to 
Benito Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn spoke about the contract during the winter but did not address it during 
the season. But Clark said that Gwynn was wrong to talk about it publicly, 
saying he receives no sympathy from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be, 'Poor little Tony making $1 million and batting .300,' "Clark 
said. "That's not something you should be pouting about. How about the kids in 
wheelchairs and those people? Should they feel sorry for him? 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
Clark also criticized Alicia Gwynn, Tony's wife, for being quoted in a recent 
story in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"He let his wife do a lot of the talking for him," Clark said. "It's like, 
'Tony, do you put your foot down, or do you let your wife talk for you?' Hey, 
maybe we should all get our wives involved in the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is a joke. It's almost like every day we're supposed to wonder 
what he feels about us or what his wife feels about us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to think. Is he blaming us because he didn't win the batting 
title (he finished at .309)? Hey, is it my fault? Is it our fault? Maybe he's 
happy because we lost seven (actually eight) in a row? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy his crap of being upset after games we win, when he doesn't have a 
good game. He says he does that because he gets mad at himself. That's bull. . 
. . You win as a team, and you lose as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Clark predicted that as long as Gwynn is on the team without changing his 
approach, the Padres will never win another championship. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very obvious reasons why this organization doesn't win," Clark said. 
"They're not going to get rid of everybody in the clubhouse, but you know, 
there's a (better) chance he's going to be here than the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, this stuff should have been taken care of a long time ago, but they've 
just let it linger. They've kind of created their own monster. Guys have been 
running around here for the last two years running their own individual scams. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a right way to win, and there's a wrong way to win. And I guarantee 
you, this isn't the right way." 
</P>
<P>
On his own status with the Padres, Clark, in the final year of a three-year, 
$6-million contract, said he would force the Padres to make a trade if he is 
given arbitration as his salary option. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Clark was offered a one-year, $2.5 million contract with a 
one-year option for $2.5 million. He angrily rejected the proposal and has not 
been offered another. 
</P>
<P>
Although no other offer can be made until the Padres hire a new general 
manager, sources in the Padre hierarchy said it was unlikely one would be 
forthcoming, thus allowing Clark arbitration rights. 
</P>
<P>
"If it comes to that, I'll ask to be traded," Clark said. "And if they don't, 
I'll stir up more (stuff). If they think that this something, they ain't heard 
nothing yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, they're playing their hand out, and I'm going to play my hand out." 
</P>
<P>
Clark could be holding all of the cards if he is declared a second-look free 
agent through the collusion hearings. That decision is expected in late 
October. He is scheduled to leave the Thursday after the regular season ends 
for New York to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"That'll give me some options," Clark said. "I can pick and choose what other 
places I want to play. More that anything, it'll give me the chance to get the 
type of deal I'm looking for." 
</P>
<P>
In another development in the brown pin-stripe soap opera, Pat Dobson, Padre 
pitching coach, has been granted permission by Padre Chairman Tom Werner to 
discuss employment with other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, Padre pitching coach for the past three seasons, has one year left on 
his contract for $75,000. But after several clubs recently expressed interested 
in interviewing Dobson for the same position, Werner gave permission. 
</P>
<P>
If Dobson indeed leaves, he's expected to be replaced by Larry Rothschild, the 
Cincinnati Reds bullpen coach, or Jon Matlack, the Padres' double-A pitching 
coach in Wichita.

PADRES RAIN ON THE REDS

<P>
The Cincinnati Reds were quizzed all afternoon Friday on their preference of 
teams to play in the National League playoffs. When they finally got away for 
batting practice, they spent the next 45 minutes in a team meeting, dividing 
playoff and World Series shares. 
</P>
<P>
While the Reds were breaking up their meeting, debating among themselves which 
brand of champagne would be best to spray on each other, a crowd of 35,399 was 
congregating at Riverfront Stadium, preparing for their celebration. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one element missing in all of their gala preparations. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't you know it, the Reds had to go out and play a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
Yep. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Padres 2, Reds 1. 
</P>
<P>
The champagne stays chilled and, for at least one more day, the Reds remain 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we've been waiting for this a long time," said right fielder 
Paul O'Neill of the Reds, "but what's another day? 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't going to roll over dead for us because we're in first place. San 
Diego proved that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres hardly resembled the team that was swept last weekend in San Diego, 
when they lost four games by a combined score of 34-12. 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly a refreshing change," Padre first baseman Jack Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
There was Bruce Hurst pitching a four-hit complete game, with only Chris Sabo's 
home run in the second inning preventing him from obtaining his major league 
leading fifth shutout. 
</P>
<P>
There was Clark, tying the score with a 450-foot homer in the seventh inning 
against starter Danny Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
There was Benito Santiago winning the game with a two-out double in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Red Manager Lou Piniella, taking his frustration out on reporters 
for being -- ready for this? -- too positive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got two more games to win," Piniella said angrily. "This thing isn't 
over yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the media in this town has made a big hullabaloo of this, and it's 
given this team a false sense of security." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Reds' magic number to clinch their first division championship since 
1979 is only one, and they own a five-game lead with five games remaining. To 
blow it now would make the Phillies' collapse in '64 look like a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
But when you've been in first place all season, began selling playoff tickets a 
week ago, and were displaying videos celebrating the 1979 division championship 
on the scoreboard Friday night, the Reds can't be faulted for looking a little 
silly dragging this division race into the final days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone on too long already," said Red pitcher Jose Rijo, the man who 
claimed the race was over a week ago. "Let's get it over with. Enough's 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's what the Padres were thinking Friday. This is a team that has 
watched six teams celebrate championships in the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of watching other teams celebrate against us," Santiago said. "It 
gets old." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst (11-9) shut down the heart of the Reds' lineup in the bottom of the 
ninth, preventing the ball from even being hit out of the infield, and the Reds 
went back to the clubhouse, answering questions why they continue to prolong 
the agony. 
</P>
<P>
Said Piniella: "I don't care if people here have been waiting 11 years or 30 
years. The schedule says 162 games, and until a team is mathematically 
eliminated, you don't clinch. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a great position. We expect to win. But let's win first, before we 
start doing anything else." 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice one to win," the Padres' Bip Roberts said, "especially what they 
did against us in San Diego. But we want to be competitive. We don't want to 
let anyone back into it. 
</P>
<P>
"If they earn it, they earn it. But we're not just going to give it to them, 
and watch them celebrate in front of our faces." 
</P>
<P>
The Padre victory, their first in nine games, also left the Reds wondering what 
they were going to do with themselves the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Their original plan was to knock off the Padres, dash back in the clubhouse, 
and sit around watching the Dodger-Giant game on ESPN-TV. But once after the 
Reds lost, themselves, not a soul bothered to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it screwed up a lot of people's plans around here," first baseman Todd 
Benzinger said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gebhard, one of the finalists for the vacancy as Padre general manager, is 
in Cincinnati watching the team for the fourth consecutive game, but he said 
the trip was planned six weeks ago and that he's in Cincinnati only to scout 
the Padres for the Minnesota Twins. Gebhard, vice president/player personnel of 
the Twins, said that he has been interviewed by Padre Chairman Tom Werner and 
Russell Goldsmith, vice chairman. "I'm just waiting like everyone else," he 
said. "I really don't know what kind of chance I have." Gebhard, 46, is one of 
five candidates who have been interviewed for the Padre opening, created last 
week when Jack McKeon was fired. The others: Dan Duquette, assistant general 
manager of the Montreal Expos; Gordon Ash, assistant general manager of the 
Toronto Blue Jays; Roger Jongewaard, vice president/scouting and player 
development of the Seattle Mariners, and Walt Jocketty, director of baseball 
administration of the Oakland Athletics. The Padres will make a decision by 
Oct. 15, one owner said Friday, but he declined to identify the leading 
candidate. . . . Jack Clark's ejection Wednesday, when he threw first base 
toward the stands at Candlestick Park, is being reviewed by the National League 
office. Clark also is scheduled to meet with Manager Greg Riddoch about the 
incident and explain why he left the clubhouse before the end of the game. At 
least someone is finding humor in the episode. Jack Buck, CBS-TV announcer, is 
planning to present a trophy to Clark before today's game for longest 
base-toss. Clark beat Reds Manager Lou Piniella. Wasn't Piniella's throw a 
little longer? "Maybe," Buck said, "but Lou had to throw it twice, too." . . . 
Clark spent the day in Cleveland Thursday, monitoring the progress of a trailer 
that's being made for his racing team. He also missed the team party Thursday 
night. . . . Awards voted by the Padre players and presented at the party: Bip 
Roberts, most valuable player; Ed Whitson, pitcher of the year; Rich Rodriquez, 
rookie of the year; Joe Carter, best dressed player, and Calvin Schiraldi, 
worst dressed player.

EMBARRASSING PADRES OWE DODGERS FOR DISMAL SHOWING AGAINST REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just finished reading the article in The Times regarding Tony Gwynn's 
difficult season and his relationship with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
It left me disgusted and ashamed at the immature behavior of his fellow Padre 
players. How could these "grown" men act so childish, especially toward someone 
who has been such a valuable part of the team for so many years? 
</P>
<P>
All athletes, no matter how gifted, are prone to errors and slumps, both mental 
and physical. When a player recognizes his weak points and adjusts his play 
accordingly, can we really call him selfish? We should instead call him a 
versatile competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Grow up, little Padres! 
</P>
<P>
Give 'em hell, Tony!

If Minnie Minoso had played continuously for six decades, that would truly be 
something to be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
However, being stuck in a game for one or two at-bats is no accomplishment, for 
Minoso or the White Sox. Sure, Nolan Ryan is still playing -- he wins games, he 
strikes people out. If the Sox are willing to put Minoso in for one game, they 
should be willing to have him on the team. Permanently.

Al Davis needs to wake up and realize where he is.

This is Los Angeles, not Oakland. A large portion of the crowd that attends a 
Raider game at the Coliseum goes to watch the visiting teams. At last week's 
Raider-Steeler game, perhaps 20% of the crowd was made up of Steeler fans. At 
$30 a ticket, that is a lot of money to the Raider organization, yet the 
Raiders seem content to keep the Coliseum the most inhospitable stadium on the 
West Coast, if not the entire country.

STORIES SHOULD REFLECT MORE GOOD, NOT BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although sports have undergone a drastic change from "fun" to "big business," I 
really think the average fan and sports page reader still looks at sports 
through the eyes of their childhood when all sports were "fun." 
</P>
<P>
I abhor the current sports columnists and "beat writers" who only emphasize the 
negatives and seldom feature the positive aspects of a player or a game. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in your departmentalized format, even the headline writers have become 
negative. Take your Saturday, Sept. 15, editions, for example. Of the six 
stories on your front page, five have negative connotations. "Head Coaches Risk 
Disgrace for Brillance," "Past Doesn't Leave Henning at a Loss," "Past Glory 
Won't Help at the Coliseum Today" and "Aztecs Must Clean Up their Act by 
Tonight" are samples. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest your staff look for the silver lining and not the clouds in their 
approach.

I have been a season ticket-holder of the Raiders since they arrived in Los 
Angeles and have been witness to all too many fights in the stands.

Then I read the quote from Coliseum spokeswoman Alisa Spillman, who said: "We 
really don't see it like it's going to erupt into this huge rash of problems. 
It was an isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
When will the officials at the Coliseum sober up? More security is not the 
answer. They should follow the lead of the Rose bowl and ban the sale of all 
alcohol, not just in the fourth quarter.

EMBARRASSING PADRES OWE DODGERS FOR DISMAL SHOWING AGAINST REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Dodger fan, I felt like such an idiot rooting for the lowly Padres last 
weekend. You don't realize what a lifeless, gutless, truly atrocious team the 
Padres are until you're put in a position in which you must pull for them. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the Padres fumble and bumble their way to a four-game sweep by the 
Reds raised the very real suspicion that San Diego was tanking it against 
Cincinnati to make things more difficult for the hated Dodgers. The evidence: 
Mark Parent, who couldn't throw out Roseanne Barr trying to steal, started two 
games in the series with the Reds; Atlee Hammaker, who couldn't last six 
innings if you put a gun to his head, made a start against Cincinnati. Neither 
of these alleged players saw action in the recent series against the Dodgers, 
which the Padres played as if it were the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
If I were the Dodgers' starting pitcher in Game 1 of next week's series against 
San Diego, I'd drill the Padres' first four batters of the game -- one for each 
game San Diego gave to Cincinnati last weekend. The Dodgers need not worry 
about retaliation from San Diego -- the Padres have proven they are spineless 
wimps.

Garrick Emry rushed for 143 yards in 18 carries and scored a pair of touchdowns 
to lead Esperanza High School to a 36-21 victory over Long Beach Jordan Friday 
in a nonleague football game at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
Emry turned a fourth-down play into an important touchdown in the third quarter 
for Esperanza (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 22-14, with 9:30 left in the third quarter, the Aztecs faced a 
fourth-and-two at the Jordan 43. Emry, a junior fullback, took the handoff into 
the middle of the line looking for first-down yardage, but broke free for a 
43-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza added to its lead with the help of a long pass. Quarterback Keith 
McDonald completed a 42-yard pass to running back Jarod Smith for a first down 
at the Jordan eight. Three plays later, Mark Parlin scored on a one-yard run. 
Clay King then kicked the extra point, his fourth, to give Esperanza a 36-14 
lead with 4:05 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan (1-3) had taken a 7-0 lead early in the game, but Esperanza rallied to 
tie with the help of a 15-yard scoring pass from McDonald to Reid Pullen with 
1:41 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza, the fourth-ranked team in Orange County, took the lead for good with 
19 seconds left in the period on Emry's 24-yard touchdown run. He then ran in 
the two-point conversion to give Esperanza a 15-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On the play before the touchdown, Jordan was called for too many men on the 
field and the penalty gave Esperanza a first down on the Jordan 24. 
</P>
<P>
Smith broke free for a 68-yard touchdown run with 6:05 left in the half to give 
Esperanza a 22-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan cut the lead to 22-14 on a 39-yard scoring pass from Johnny Nansen to 
Joel Rosborough with 10 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's final score came when Jerome Henderson took a punt and ran it back 88 
yards for a touchdown with 1:46 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza recovered the following on-sides kick and ran out the clock.

Katella High School's coach Larry Anderson is glad he stayed with his new 
quarterback, Chris Reed, even though Katella trailed Estancia early during 
Friday night's game against Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
Reed rallied the Knights, picking apart the Eagle secondary by completing 16 of 
28 passes for 248 yards and two touchdowns to lead Katella to a 28-14 victory 
at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Reed found Art Vance for a 67-yard completion that tied the game at 7-7 with 
4:11 left in the first half. Reed sealed Katella's first victory of the year 
with a 12-yarder to Vance in the left corner of the end zone to make it 28-14 
with 2:42 to play. 
</P>
<P>
"If he gets the protection, Reed is one of the best passing quarterbacks in the 
county," Anderson said, "but last week, Orange had great pass pressure and kept 
Reed on his back." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

SOLLIDAY'S FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES LEAD CAPISTRANO VALLEY

<P>
Capistrano Valley High School's 37-13 victory over Servite Friday night came 
down to a simple game of catch between Cougar quarterback Tony Solliday and 
wide receiver Dave Poltl. 
</P>
<P>
Solliday completed 12 of 16 passes for 134 yards and four touchdowns, including 
three to Poltl, as the second-ranked Cougars won at Capistrano Valley. Solliday 
threw touchdown passes of 4, 23 and 4 yards to Poltl. Solliday's other 
touchdown pass was a 27-yard completion to Scott Patton. 
</P>
<P>
Poltl finished with four catches for 36 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game is passing," Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton said. "We just 
needed some momentum to get it going." 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Brion supplied that momentum. The senior free safety intercepted two 
passes by Servite quarterback Scott Jones. 
</P>
<P>
One Brion interception set up a Solliday touchdown pass to Poltl late in the 
second quarter. The Cougars intercepted three of Jones' passes, including two 
by Brion, who returned his last one 80 yards for a touchdown in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"His interception at the end (of the first half) really sparked us," Patton 
said. "And the 80-yard return showed what he is capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley relied on its defense early while it waited for the offense 
to get going. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars took a 3-0 lead when Tomek Mikler kicked a 27-yard field goal with 
10 minutes 51 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars struck again later in the quarter after Brion intercepted Jones at 
the Capistrano Valley 44-yard line and returned it 28 yards to the Servite 28. 
</P>
<P>
Then Solliday went to work, completing four consecutive passes, including a 
four-yard touchdown completion to Poltl with 15 seconds left in the second 
quarter. Capistrano Valley led, 10-0, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Capistrano Valley's defense held Servite to 44 yards total 
offense, including one yard passing. The Friars finished with 199 yards total 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Another Servite turnover led to Capistrano Valley's first score of the second 
half. Cougar linebacker Scott Newell forced a Jones fumble that was recovered 
by Jon Petke at the Servite 27. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Solliday hit Patton in the back of the end zone for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Servite cut the deficit to 17-7 with 3:19 left in the third quarter when Jones 
capped a five-play, 61-yard drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Michael 
Hill. Jones also threw a 33-yard completion to Ken Mousseau on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley didn't let up as Solliday drove the Cougars 80 yards, 
finishing with his second touchdown pass to Poltl, a 23-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
A four-yard touchdown run by Servite's Mike Wallock with 7:36 left in the 
fourth quarter made the score, 24-13. Solliday's four-yard touchdown pass to 
Poltl and Brion's interception return for a touchdown rounded out the scoring.

Randy Karliner threw two touchdown passes and ran for one to lead Ocean View 
over Fountain Valley, 30-0, in Friday's Sunset League opener at Sheue Field. 
</P>
<P>
Karliner completed a 26-yard scoring pass to Jeff Bush with 8:45 remaining in 
the first quarter and a 28-yard touchdown pass to Dennis Eichen in the final 
four seconds of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He also scored on an eight-yard run outside right tackle in the final 3:25 of 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View Coach Howard Isom said this was Karliner's best game. "He has 
started to settle down," Isom said. "He is not as pressed as he was earlier in 
the season." 
</P>
<P>
Karliner completed 19 passes for 188 yards. He also gained 59 of Ocean View's 
134 rushing yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (1-0, 4-0) dominated the game from the opening kickoff. At halftime, 
the Seahawks had netted 303 yards while their defense held Fountain Valley 
(0-1, 0-4) to a net total of 95 yards on 14 plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense rose to the occasion. It was our best defensive effort this year," 
Isom said. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 14-0, Ocean View lined up in punt formation with 9:20 left in the 
second quarter. Albert Fanoga received the snap and promptly completed a 
58-yard scoring pass to Eichen. 
</P>
<P>
After the ensuing kickoff, which went in the end zone, Fountain Valley marched 
from its 20 to the Ocean View 12 on nine plays. Two costly penalties, the 
latter called for an illegal forward pass by Marcos Diaz that ended the Barons' 
possession, stopped the drive. BOB BORSUM

MARINA GETS ON THE BALL, BEATS SANTA ANA

<P>
You can call it good defense. Or you can call it inept offense. But what you 
can't call it is nail-biting football. 
</P>
<P>
For the better part of 3 1/2 quarters, neither visiting Santa Ana nor Marina 
high schools could put together enough offense to score. 
</P>
<P>
So the Marina defense decided to pick up the slack and, combined with an 
ill-timed pitchout by Santa Ana quarterback Albert Perez, finally scored with 3 
minutes 14 seconds left in the game for a 7-0 victory Friday night in the 
Sunset League opening game for both teams in front of 1,500 at Westminster High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The play that buried Santa Ana (0-4, 0-1) came on a second-and-nine from the 
Saints' 28-yard line when Perez, under heavy pressure from the Viking defense, 
tried to pitch the ball to fullback Kevin Pola. The ball sailed past Pola and 
was kicked, pushed and generally manhandled by a host of players from both 
sides, until senior defensive end Frank Marvitz fell on it in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say enough about our defense," Marina Coach John Seeley said. "They 
bailed us out quarter after quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Marina (3-1, 1-0) stayed mostly on the ground by rushing senior fullback Shawn 
Fulford 22 times for 92 yards, including nine times for 41 yards in a 12-play 
drive midway through the second period. 
</P>
<P>
For Santa Ana, it was a bitter return to the Sunset League and Division I play 
after 16 years in the Century League, where they won the championship last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The deepest the Saints could move the ball was to the Viking 25-yard line 
midway through the third quarter. The drive stalled, however, and a 42-yard 
field goal attempt by Gustavo Plasencia was partially blocked by a Marina 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
Seeley wasn't pleased with his team's offensive output. 
</P>
<P>
"We had out chances in the ballgame to put it away and just didn't do it," he 
said.

Santiago High School capitalized on six Los Amigos turnovers Friday night to 
win its first game of the season, a 23-7 homecoming victory at Garden Grove 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers (1-3, 1-0) took a 14-0 first quarter lead before Los Amigos (2-2, 
0-1) could run one offensive play. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago took the opening kickoff and drove 68 yards in 13 plays with Alex 
Ripley scoring on a five-yard plunge and was on its way to the Garden Grove 
League victory. 
</P>
<P>
Scott McGarrh recovered Derick Ragsdale's fumble of the kickoff return on the 
Lobo 22-yard line and Santiago quarterback Mike Carrasco passed one yard to 
Kevin Gillian for the touchdown six plays later. 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos scored with 51 seconds left in the first quarter on Ragsdale's 
three-yard run and Ethan Siddall kicked the extra point to close the gap to 
14-7. Dan Agramont kicked a 31-yard field goal for a 17-7 halftime lead after 
David Cruz's interception of a deflected Siddall pass. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Devaney's interception of another Siddall pass set up the last Cavalier 
score on a 17-yard run by Tom Terrones in the last minute of play. Garden Grove 
transfer Ripley led the Cavalier offense with 90 yards rushing in 24 carries 
while Noa Utu led the defense with three sacks for 36 yards and a forced 
fumble. TOM BIRSCHBACH

WOODBRIDGE WINS TO HONOR PLAYER

Playing hard-charging defense to honor a sidelined friend, Woodbridge High 
School defeated Irvine, 19-7, Friday at Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
As Bron George watched from the sideline wearing a neck brace, the Warriors' 
defense, from 5-foot-5, 180-pound linebacker Dae Kim to 6-2, 220-pound 
defensive end Trent Bordok, played with an aggressiveness that flustered 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
George, a junior linebacker, injured his neck on a tackle in the fourth quarter 
of Woodbridge's game against Trabuco Hills last Friday. He was told by doctors 
Saturday that, because he was born with an abnormally narrow spinal cord, he 
should no longer play football. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge coaches and every Warrior -- under his uniform -- wore T-shirts 
Friday that read: "Woodbridge Football is made of Bron." 
</P>
<P>
In winning their second consecutive game, the Warriors (2-2) played up to that 
slogan. The defense pressured Irvine quarterback Jason Minici nearly every time 
he dropped back to pass. Minici completed only 12 of 33 passes for 92 yards. 
The Warriors also intercepted two Minici passes, including one by Tyrelle Ash 
with 49 seconds remaining to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (3-1), which entered the game ranked 10th in Orange County, scored first 
on a three-yard quarterback dive by Minici late in the first quarter. The 
touchdown was set up by a Woodbridge pass interference penalty on third and 
goal at Woodbridge's 5-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
It was to be the Warriors' first of five pass interference penalties, the price 
of their aggressive defense. Woodbridge was penalized 15 times for 127 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But the Warriors' defense held off all scoring opportunities and Bob Lee 
returned the ensuing kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown. Brian Nurick's extra 
point tied the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Then on the first Irvine play after the Woodbridge touchdown, Minici fumbled 
the snap from center and John Rozelle recovered on the 18. After Woodbridge 
stalled at the 12-yard line, Nurick kicked a 27-yard field goal.

Jeff Brunswig scored three touchdowns to lead Canyon High School to a 20-6 
victory over Magnolia in a nonleague football game Friday at El Modena High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (1-3) was led by Brunswig's 68 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia is also 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon scored on its first possession. Brunswig culminated a 15-play, 67-yard 
drive with a 15-yard touchdown run up the middle with 4:41 left in the first 
quarter. The touchdown was set up by a pass interference penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty seemed ironic because the game had so little passing. Canyon 
quarterback Darren Lish was two for three for 22 yards and Magnolia quarterback 
Doug Isaacks was not allowed to throw until the second half when he completed 
three of six for just 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Brunswig's second touchdown came in the second quarter after Magnolia fumbled 
the snap on its two-yard line. Brunswig took the ball on next play and dove for 
the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The next time Brunswig got his hands on the ball, he scored on a one-yard run 
with 30 seconds left in the half. HEATHER SMALLEY

Corona del Mar High School rallied from a 9-0 deficit to defeat Trabuco Hills, 
10-9, at Mission Viejo High Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (2-2) relied on a stubborn defense that, despite giving up 301 
total yards, kept the Sea Kings in the game until the offense, which gained 
only 67 yards in the first half, woke up. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was a 31-yard interception return by Corona del Mar's Scott Pannier 
that set up the Sea Kings' first score. After an incomplete pass, Todd Kehrli 
threw 39 yards to a wide open Jeff Wegener for the touchdown. After an 
unsportsmanlike penalty was called on Wegener for spiking the ball, Tom Hess 
kicked a 35-yard extra point to make the score 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea King defense then forced Trabuco Hills (1-2-1) to punt and Corona del 
Mar took over at its own 40. After a 16-yard gain by Hess on a reverse, the Sea 
King offense appeared to be in trouble again when it faced a third-and-17 
situation from the Mustang 41. But Kehrli threw 33 yards to Jason Clark to put 
the ball at the eight. Three running plays resulted in three yards lost, so 
Hess kicked a 24-yard field goal with 6:16 left to give Corona del Mar a 10-9 
lead.

DORSEY THWARTS UPSET BID BY SAN FERNANDO, 20-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not that the Dorsey High Dons aren't intent on defending their City 
Section 4-A Division title. It's just that they need a little wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
One week after overcoming an eight-point halftime deficit to beat Granada 
Hills, Dorsey did it to a Valley team again, scoring 14 points in the final 
nine minutes to thwart a San Fernando upset bid and escape with a 20-10 victory 
Friday night at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After jumping to a 10-6 halftime lead, the emotionally charged Tigers (2-1) 
failed to stop the City Section's second-ranked 4-A Division team with the game 
on the line. 
</P>
<P>
A 32-yard punt return by Greg Burns gave Dorsey (3-0) field position at the San 
Fernando 34-yard line early in the fourth quarter. Just three plays later, 
Sharmon Shah swept 16 yards for a touchdown with 9 minutes 20 seconds left to 
give Dorsey its first lead. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, operating without City Section 4-A Player of the Year Lamont Warren, 
who was resting an injured ankle, then struck again to put the game away. 
Quarterback Ronald Peebles hit Keyshawn Johnson for a 58-yard touchdown with 
5:43 left to make it 20-10. 
</P>
<P>
A late San Fernando push to the 10-yard line ended when quarterback Cruz 
Trevino fumbled on fourth down with just 3:46 left. 
</P>
<P>
In Warren's absence, Shah and Yukion Fierson combined for 121 yards in 23 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well at all," Dorsey co-Coach Paul Knox said. "We were just 
waiting for something to happen. We needed a big play." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was especially tough for San Fernando, which received outstanding 
games from Leonice Brown (55 yards), Will Taylor (81 yards) and LaKarlos 
Townsend (36 yards). The Tigers, however, were hurt by four lost fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando set the first-half tone with a strong defensive stand. After 
Townsend fumbled on the fourth play of the game, Dorsey took over on the San 
Fernando 18-yard line. The Dons drove to a first-and-goal situation at the 
seven-yard line, but the Tigers would allow no more. 
</P>
<P>
Three consecutive rushes got Dorsey no closer than the two-yard line, and the 
Dons were forced to attempt a 24-yard field goal. When Adrian Villareal's 
attempt missed left, the Tiger sideline erupted and San Fernando began a long 
scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
Utilizing their three-back backfield of Townsend, Brown and Taylor (who 
combined for 106 rushing yards in the first half), the Tigers drove 80 yards in 
11 plays, all on the ground. Townsend's two-yard run gave San Fernando a 7-0 
lead and a clear emotional edge. 
</P>
<P>
But Dorsey marched back, moving 59 yards in just four plays, capped by 
Fierson's 29-yard touchdown sweep. But Peebles, Dorsey's holder, failed in an 
attempt at a two-point run.

COLELLA LIFTS NOTRE DAME TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his 11 seasons at the school, Notre Dame High Coach Kevin Rooney has had, he 
says, "a couple of pretty good quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Not world-beaters, mind you, but guys who could play their position and 
occasionally hurt an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The list of attributes would normally read as follows: decent arm, fairly 
mobile, good head on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't great," Rooney said. "They were all-league and all, but I've 
never had more confidence throwing the ball than I do right now." 
</P>
<P>
And behind Rooney's quarterback of today, senior Steve Colella, Notre Dame 
hammered Chaminade, 35-21, Friday night in a Mission League opener at Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Colella, who completed 11 of 19 passes for a career-high 189 yards, threw a 
pair of scoring passes to lead the Knights, who led, 35-0, midway through the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great one," said senior running back Fano Malieitulua, who has known 
Colella since the second grade. "He's always real confident. Whenever we mess 
up, he comes back to the huddle and says, 'Hey, forget it, let's go.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was go from the opening gun for Notre Dame (2-2, 1-0 in league play), which 
scored on its first five possessions. 
</P>
<P>
And as much as Colella's emergence has sparked the team to two consecutive 
victories, Malieitulua's hot streak hasn't hurt, either. The 5-10, 170-pound 
senior rushed for 155 yards in 25 carries and scored on runs of five and three 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"People know now that they have to deal with two people," Colella said. "They 
have to watch the pass and the run." 
</P>
<P>
And for most of the first three quarters, Chaminade (1-2-1, 0-1) watched Notre 
Dame do both at will. The Knights rolled up 294 yards in the first half alone 
and finished with 418. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade didn't score until there were 7 minutes 12 seconds left in the third 
quarter, when tailback Travis Hall scored on a 29-yard pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Other than pony-tailed kicker Amy Cook, who was three-for-three on conversion 
attempts, Hall was Chaminade's bright light. He finished with 130 yards in 14 
carries, 96 of which came in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame scored on all four of its first-half possessions en route to a 28-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights drove 82 yards in 10 plays on their first scoring drive, Colella 
hitting wide receiver Kirk Miller in the left corner of the end zone from 17 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade managed a first down on its first possession, but Notre Dame's 
defense -- which held the Eagles to 82 yards and four first downs in the half 
-- forced a punt. Colella hit tight end Aaron Jones for nine yards on a 
fourth-and-five play from the Chaminade 35 to keep the drive going, and 
receiver Vinnie Orlando scored four plays later on a 14-yard reverse to give 
the Knights a 14-0 lead with 51 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade running back Joe Costa fumbled on Chaminade's first play on its 
ensuing possession and Notre Dame recovered at the Eagle 44. Notre Dame took a 
21-0 lead 10 plays later, Malieitulua scoring on a five-yard sweep with 8:02 
left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame then put Chaminade away, gaining a 28-0 lead after Malieitulua 
scored from five yards with 1:36 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Colella completed nine of 14 for 173 yards in the first half alone, with Miller 
hauling in five for 137 yards. Miller intercepted a pass as a defensive back 
but did not catch a Colella throw in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade quarterback Jeff Meyer completed 11 of 28 for 118 yards and one 
touchdown but threw two interceptions. Chaminade receivers also dropped five 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade gained 277 yards, 195 in the second half as Notre Dame cleared the 
bench.

FANN AND BRIDEWELL, CANDIDATES FOR DIVISION II AWARD, WILL MATCH TALENTS WHEN 
NORTHRIDGE PLAYS UC DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Payton, Neil Lomax, Ken O'Brien and John Stallworth didn't receive their 
share of recognition when they played NCAA Division II college football. 
Neither did Harlon Hill, a wide receiver from Florence State (Ala.) Teachers 
College. But like the others he made the transition to the National Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, in an effort to honor players from smaller programs, the Harlon Hill 
Trophy -- the Division II equivalent of the Heisman -- was established. 
</P>
<P>
Two leading candidates for the award, Cal State Northridge tailback Albert Fann 
and UC Davis quarterback Jeff Bridewell, will meet tonight at 7 in a Western 
Football Conference game at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Although both players downplay their desire to win the Harlon Hill, the battle 
between two of the nation's best Division II players is likely to intrigue 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Like Payton, Lomax, O'Brien, and Stallworth before them, Fann and Bridewell 
have the talent to play in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Fann stuck by a commitment to Coach Bob Burt and his neighborhood university 
after satisfying classroom requirements and renewing the interest of Division I 
recruiters who had feared that he would not qualify academically under 
Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
Bridewell, a late bloomer, did not start at Napa Vintage High until his senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't start your junior year in high school it is hard to justify a 
Division I scholarship unless you are just outstanding your senior year," 
Bridewell said. 
</P>
<P>
While Fann has started since his freshman year at CSUN and has rolled up 3,390 
yards in 706 carries -- he is 183 yards shy of the school career mark -- 
Bridewell's path to Harlon Hill candidacy has taken several turns. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5, 220-pound quarterback redshirted his first year, then suffered a 
broken wrist his second year and received a hardship redshirt. He was a backup 
in his third year and was limited to four appearances and 100 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Bridewell's fourth season, he started and threw for 405 yards the 
first three games. Unexpectedly, he was benched for the rest of the season with 
the exception of a few mop-up stints. 
</P>
<P>
Confused and disappointed, he considered transferring. 
</P>
<P>
"I went so far as to talk to coaches at other schools," he said. "I thought 
about it and decided that if worse comes to worst at least I have my 
education." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, for Bridewell, Bob Foster took over the Davis program the next 
season and restored Bridewell's status as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's been going great since the coaching change," Bridewell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think it could get this good. I was hoping it could. When I 
was really down, I was thinking that it could go from the very bottom to the 
very top." 
</P>
<P>
Bridewell threw for 2,731 yards in 1989 with a 63.3% completion rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The way our offense is designed, if you run our offense right, you should have 
a high completion rate and you should throw for a reasonable number of yards," 
Bridewell said. "It is just me executing the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Bridewell attributes a paucity of interceptions -- 13 in parts of four seasons 
-- to his sixth-year status. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about me is that I know my limitations," he said. "I don't 
force the ball. I only make the plays I am capable of making." 
</P>
<P>
He ranks fifth nationally in passing efficiency and sixth in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Fann has been slowed by a hamstring pull. Through three games he 
has gained 218 yards rushing and 197 yards in kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
"People say that (opponents) are stacking defenses against me, but our offense 
just hasn't clicked yet," said Fann, whose hamstring has improved. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to grow and I think we are getting toward that. This is the time 
when I usually pick it up every year."

KENNEDY ROLLS OVER CRENSHAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than 25 minutes before the opening kickoff Friday, Kennedy High Coach Bob 
Francola voiced his fears as he eyed the potholes and several crooked chalk 
lines on the Crenshaw football field. 
</P>
<P>
He feared that the Golden Cougars might commit crucial turnovers -- something 
they had avoided in two previous games. He also disliked the sunlight, worrying 
that the 3 p.m. start -- Kennedy's only day game of the season -- would dampen 
his team's intensity. 
</P>
<P>
But Francola's concerns proved groundless. The Golden Cougars continued to play 
stingy defense and relied on the running of Ontiwaun Carter, who rushed for 181 
yards and three touchdowns, to post a 34-0 nonleague victory over Crenshaw 
(0-2). In three victories this season, Kennedy has outscored its opponents, 
106-2. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, a senior running back who rushed for 250 yards and scored six times in 
the Golden Cougars' first two games, scored a touchdown in each of the first 
three quarters on runs of 12, one and three yards, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy wasted no time taking control of the ball and the game. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Sanders picked off a tipped pass from Crenshaw quarterback Daryl Loper 
and returned it seven yards to Crenshaw's 23-yard line on the third play of the 
game. Three plays later, Carter bolted 12 yards for a touchdown on the first of 
his 30 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mike McMullen, who played just three quarters, completed nine of 17 
passes for 191 yards. Keith West caught six passes for 107 yards, including a 
42-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's defense was exceptional, forcing six turnovers -- four interceptions 
and two fumble recoveries -- to give the defense 15 in three games. Kennedy 
allowed only 67 yards, just two through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, a strong safety, intercepted two passes, returned one 50 yards for a 
touchdown and recovered a Crenshaw fumble on the Cougars' 10-yard line in the 
third quarter to set up Kennedy's fourth touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Francola remained unimpressed, pointing to Kennedy's two turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we played well, I thought we were flat," he said. "And I don't 
care how much we stressed this week that this was an important game, they're 
thinking about Granada Hills. These kids have that on their mind." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy opens Northwest Valley Conference play next week against Granada Hills 
(2-1), the Valley's top-rated City Section team.

Barstow 20, Palmdale 6 -- Barstow iced the game with 1:13 left when quarterback 
John Apodaca passed to Glen Penlind for a 40-yard touchdown at Barstow High. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (2-2) led, 10-6, with four minutes to play but were stopped on a 
goal-line stand. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Barstow linebacker David Neal sacked Palmdale backup 
quarterback Rodney Williams for a safety, and the Aztecs scored the final 
touchdown on their next possession. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale (1-3) pulled to within 7-6 in the second quarter when Williams found 
Mike Frazier alone in front of the goal posts from 10 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale starting quarterback Jay Mapson left the game in the second quarter 
after two Barstow defenders tackled him just after he completed a 16-yard pass 
to Anthony Ortega for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale scored its only touchdown two plays later. The Falcons finished with 
82 yards passing and 41 rushing. The Aztecs gained 252 yards. MIKE GLAZE

THE COLLEGES: ACADEMIC SENATE COULD USE STUDY SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is amazing how ignorant presumably intelligent people can sound when they 
disparage something they know very little about. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Cal State Northridge's Academic Senate this week is a prime 
example. 
</P>
<P>
After much discussion -- some of it comically lacking in accuracy -- senators 
passed a motion expressing "concern" over the athletic program's move this year 
to NCAA Division I status. The motion centered on a complaint that the school's 
athletic program is receiving funds that could be best used in instructional 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's budget -- as were those of other state universities -- was trimmed 
this school year, by $6.6 million. Cost-containment measures are in effect at 
CSUN, and, as a result, fewer classes are being offered, the school's libraries 
are being shut down on Sundays and some faculty research projects have been 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the claim of school President James W. Cleary, who said "not one red 
cent" of instructional money had been diverted to the athletic program, many 
inquiring academicians are in an uproar. 
</P>
<P>
Athletics just happens to be an easy target. Those who supported this motion of 
"concern" -- which is really a vote of no confidence -- have been tricked into 
basing their opposition on matters of money. 
</P>
<P>
This clouds the real issue: Whether the athletic department belongs in the 
university environment alongside, for instance, the business department. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge has an enrollment of 31,000 students in the heart of a region with a 
population of more than 2 million. Other areas of CSUN's curriculum have 
expanded in size and national prominence along with the school's burgeoning 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
So why not athletics? 
</P>
<P>
If any member of the Northridge faculty has a good answer, then let them base 
their complaints on it. Claiming misuse of instructional funds simply doesn't 
wash. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators complained that $394,000 the Cal State Northridge Foundation 
has earmarked for athletics would be better spent on instructional programs. 
Let them apply for a grant. That's what the athletic department did. The 
foundation is a nonprofit auxiliary organization of the university with a 
governing board consisting of six students, six faculty members and two 
administrators. Any university program or student can request to have projects 
funded by a grant from the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's revenue is derived largely from Northridge students through 
their purchases from the campus bookstore and food services. And where do the 
students stand on the issue of athletics? 
</P>
<P>
Well, when push came to shove at Thursday's senate meeting, Michelle Cooper, 
president of the school's Associated Student Body, praised the athletic program 
for its fund-raising efforts and held it up as a shining example that others 
might choose to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Hers were words lost in a wave of unsubstantiated claims. 
</P>
<P>
One senator complained that coaches were not earning their keep in FTEs -- 
full-time equivalent students, the formula through which the state bases its 
funding. In fact, the athletic department supports itself for staffing 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Several inaccuracies might have been avoided had senators taken a peek at the 
five-year budget plan for athletics that has been available since February. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling around the athletic department is that those who have misgivings 
should study the reasons for the Division I move, ask questions about it, then 
listen to the answers. 
</P>
<P>
Most opponents, it seems, never reached square one. 
</P>
<P>
When the senate met in May, another motion involving athletics was tabled for 
lack of a quorum. Good thing. That motion was an effort to pull the plug on the 
entire Division I move. Later, it was discovered, much to the dismay of several 
embarrassed faculty members, that athletic schedules were set and the school 
was committed to a minimum of three years in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, this week's vote does little but leave a bad taste in the mouth of 
athletic proponents. 
</P>
<P>
That taste could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
The senate rejected an amendment brought by Harbhajan Sandhu, a professor in 
the science and math department. 
</P>
<P>
It said: "It is therefore moved that there should be no monies diverted from 
instructionally related programs directly or indirectly to the Division I 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Told that some of those funds were legitimately assigned to athletics, Sandhu 
said, "Then we will add that it is not legitimately assigned." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sandhu, please see the first paragraph of this column. 
</P>
<P>
Conked out: Let it never be said that Dean Conk does not get the most out of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Conk coaches The Master's College women's volleyball team, which will spend two 
days in the Bay Area next week. On Friday, Master's (10-10) will play at Mills 
College and Saturday it has a doubleheader -- against different teams. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, Master's will play at Dominican, then, at 7:30, will meet Menlo. 
</P>
<P>
Are the players grumbling? Well, if they are, Conk isn't listening. "They have 
no choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers game: Northridge will begin baseball practice next week with a 22-man 
roster. That number might be a bit small, but it also is three more than the 
Matadors had last season. "It shouldn't be a problem unless we get a bunch of 
guys hurt at the same time," Coach Bill Kernen said. "We have a lot of guys who 
can play different positions." 
</P>
<P>
Kernen said he will work at least five players at the catcher's position: Mike 
Sims, last season's starter; Kyle Washington, last season's backup; Mark 
Clayton, Denny Vigo and Valley College recruit E. J. Pape. 
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of Clayton is particularly interesting. Last season, Clayton 
played outfield, first base and pitched in earning Division II All-American 
honors. "About the only thing he didn't do last season was catch," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
Look for Clayton's pitching role to be diminished this season. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Even if Ken Jackson and Tom Berry don't go to trial for their alleged 
involvement in an altercation with a Northridge campus security officer and 
police, the Matador football players might still face disciplinary action by 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
The incident involving Jackson and Berry is not indicative of the relationship 
between Northridge athletes and police, Lt. Mike Sugar of the State Campus 
Police said. "These are two individuals who just got carried away," Sugar said. 
"It shouldn't reflect on the entire athletic program." 
</P>
<P>
Sugar said police had some difficulty controlling a crowd that had gathered at 
the conclusion of the Sept. 14 incident, but he credited a handful of 
Northridge athletes with helping to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burt can tie Tom Keele for most wins by a Northridge football coach if the 
Matadors defeat UC Davis tonight at North Campus Stadium. Burt is 29-18 in his 
fifth season at CSUN. Keele was 30-43-1 in seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Fann needs 183 yards to establish a Northridge career rushing record. 
Fann, CSUN's senior tailback, has 3,390 yards in 706 carries, trailing Mike 
Kane, who gained 3,572 yards in 705 carries from 1983-86. 
</P>
<P>
Abo Velasco is five field goals shy of the Northridge career record of 31 held 
by Jose Ballina, who played from 1972-74. Velasco already holds the school 
career mark for conversions with 82. 
</P>
<P>
Darren McMahon tied the Northridge record for punts in a game last week with 11 
against Central (Okla.) State. The sophomore from Granada Hills can thank the 
Matadors' sputtering offense for his place in the record book. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon shares the school record with Bryan Wagner, who punted 11 times against 
Cal Lutheran in 1983. Wagner now punts for the Cleveland Browns and is enjoying 
his third full season in the NFL. McMahon is second in the Western Football 
Conference with an average of 38.8 yards a punt.

Harvard 34, La Canada 28 -- After losing fumbles on three of its first four 
possessions, Harvard (3-1) jumped to a 21-0 halftime lead and then barely held 
on at home. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard running back Kent Dahn carried eight times for 85 yards and scored on 
runs of three, one and 80 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve Kezirian, who sat out the second half, completed four of 
eight for 109 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada (2-2) scored four times in the final 11 minutes against Harvard 
reserves. Quarterback Chris Plamann completed 15 of 28 for 257 yards and two 
touchdowns. Running back Jeff Park rushed for 88 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Plamann threw a 26-yard scoring pass to Chris Ray with 22 seconds left, but La 
Canada was unable to recover an onside kick and Harvard ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard and La Canada combined for seven first-half turnovers, including three 
turnovers on consecutive plays in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't because either team was hitting hard," Harvard Coach Gary Thran 
said. "Both teams were tentative at the start. That's why there were so many 
fumbles." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard began its scoring on Dahn's three-yard run, one play after Park fumbled 
a handoff. 
</P>

GRANADA HILLS' WASHINGTON RUNS DEEPER INTO THE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, the Granada Hills High football program is updated to include 
records set the previous year. The 1990 program was circulated Thursday night 
as the Highlanders prepared to play their home opener. 
</P>
<P>
In one game, fullback Brett Washington rendered it obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to shattering four single-game school records in Granada Hills' 
48-7 defeat of Compton, Washington also set three career marks and moved within 
an eyelash of a fourth. The first mark was obliterated the first time 
Washington touched the ball: The 6-foot, 220-pound senior raced 93 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The safety was 10 yards downfield when (Washington) broke through the line and 
Brett ran by him like he wasn't even there," Granada Hills co-Coach Darryl 
Stroh said. "By the time he reached the end zone he was 10-15 yards ahead of 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The run eclipsed a record that Washington had shared with Kurt Schumacher, 
whose 89-yard run against Bell in 1974 had been the longest. Washington tied 
the mark in Granada Hills' season opener. 
</P>
<P>
"He is so explosive," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
The particulars of a dynamite night follow: 
</P>
<P>
* Washington's 252 yards rushing broke the single-game mark of 218 set by 
Khalid Ali in 1986 against Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
* His five rushing touchdowns broke Ali's single-game mark of four set against 
Westlake in the same 1986 game. 
</P>
<P>
* His 30 points broke Greg Fowble's single-game record of 28 set against Van 
Nuys in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
* Washington passed Ali (2,062 yards from 1985-86) as the career rushing 
leader. Washington has 2,216 yards in 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
* With his five touchdowns, he broke two Ali career scoring marks. Washington 
now has 27 rushing touchdowns, besting Ali's mark by three. Washington, who 
entered the game tied with Ali with 27 career touchdowns, now has 31. Before 
the night was over, five of Ali's records had been KOd. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a near-miss. Washington has scored 186 points in his 25-game 
career, one point shy of the career mark set by receiver-kicker Fowble in 
1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
Washington also holds the school record for average yards per carry at 7.5, set 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see him have that kind of success," Stroh said. "He's a 
sweetheart of a kid."

SAUGUS FALLS BEHIND POSTHASTE IN 49-7 ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Flaherty was running behind schedule most of Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Saugus High coach brought his football team out to the College of the 
Canyons field just six minutes before kickoff. No stretching. No warmups. Not 
much of anything. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions just ran onto the field then took a 49-7 nonleague beating by 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Flaherty appeared just as rushed when asked to comment on the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have time for this," he said when approached by reporters, then 
trotted toward the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions might, however, find time this week to work a little on their 
special teams, because in that aspect of the game Saugus failed miserably. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians converted four crucial special-teams miscues into four touchdowns 
and a 28-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line was that we got the big plays off their mistakes," an 
unhurried Hart Coach Mike Herrington said. "I guess that's good. But I was a 
little disappointed because we didn't get our offense rolling as far as driving 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Indians (2-2) had opportunities to gain 366 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Saugus collapse began late in the first quarter when Hart's Tucker 
Setterberg led a flood of Indians into the Centurion backfield and blocked Jeff 
Hickman's punt deep in Saugus territory. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Goeres recovered at the eight-yard line and Ryan Connors scored two plays 
later when he beat defensive back Kevin Neidigh to the outside and sprinted in 
on a five-yard bootleg. 
</P>
<P>
On the Indians' next drive, which had stalled at their own 21, Saugus (1-3) 
committed another blunder. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Allen clobbered Hart punter Doug Distaso. The 15-yard roughing-the-kicker 
penalty turned fourth and 14 into an Indian first down at the 36. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it took Hart five plays to make the Centurions pay. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Blanchard capped the 92-yard drive with an 11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
It only got worse. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's Jon Bodemer returned the second half kickoff 89 yards for a score and a 
21-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, the Indians used a fake punt to continue a scoring drive. 
Punter Distaso passed 19 yards to Damon Mori for the first down. Four plays 
later, Connors connected with Brian Bernier for a 19-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
Connors passed for 126 yards and a touchdown. He also carried 10 times for 74 
yards. Blanchard added nine carries for 89 yards and a pair of 11-yard 
touchdown runs.

QUARTZ HILL POUNDS OUT 26-7 WIN BEHIND SMITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quartz Hill High's game at San Gorgonio on Friday night was a case of the haves 
versus the have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill had Selves Smith, the team's defensive leader, back in the lineup. 
Smith missed last week's game, a one-point upset loss to Hesperia, because of a 
death in the family but returned Friday with some ferocious tackling. 
</P>
<P>
San Gorgonio, meanwhile, was without 6-foot-7, 297-pound offensive tackle Jason 
Behunin, who had an injured shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a defensive-minded 26-7 nonleague win for Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"I just missed the game so much when I was gone," Smith said. "It felt great to 
get back." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a linebacker, and his defensive teammates held San Gorgonio (1-2-1) to 
153 yards in offense and forced three turnovers. The Spartans' leading rusher, 
Hakim Porcher, carried 12 times for just 21 yards; San Gorgonio gained only 32 
yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't control the line of scrimmage, you're not going to win too many 
games," San Gorgonio Coach Karl Gaytan said. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill (3-1) had no such complaints. The Rebels' Erik Thomas ran 14 times 
for 105 yards and two touchdowns. He returned a kickoff 76 yards for a third 
score. 
</P>
<P>
The game's first touchdown came after a fumbled punt that Quartz Hill's David 
Haney recovered at the Spartan 17-yard line. Five plays later, Thomas ran one 
yard for a 7-0 lead. That score held up through halftime as Quartz Hill's 
defense asserted itself. 
</P>
<P>
On one play, Smith tackled Porcher so hard that the running back returned to 
the huddle screaming at his linemen. 
</P>
<P>
The injured Behunin could only pace the sidelines. "Gimme some shoulder pads," 
he yelled. "Forget it. Just give me a jersey. I want to hit someone." 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless third quarter, San Gorgonio threatened with a 17-play, 
11-minute drive. But the march stalled at the Quartz Hill 34-yard line after a 
holding penalty. On Quartz Hill's next possession, Thomas broke a 65-yard 
touchdown run that broke the game open. 
</P>
<P>
David Nelson added an eight-yard scoring run several minutes later and the 
Rebels led, 20-0. 
</P>
<P>
San Gorgonio spoiled the shutout with four seconds left when Bert Minjares 
threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to Michael Thomas on a flea-flicker. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels countered when Thomas returned the ensuing kickoff for the game's 
final score.

Photo, Can't Touch This: The Crenshaw High defense had little luck trying to 
stop Kennedy's Ontiwaun Carter on Friday as Carter ran over, around and through 
the Cougars for 181 yards and three touchdowns in a 34-0 win. In one instance, 
top, it took at least five Crenshaw players to stop Carter. But more often than 
not, Carter (32), middle left, found himself running to daylight. On the 
sideline, middle right, Carter draws a much-needed breather after a 
third-quarter scoring run. But Carter was not the only offensive weapon Kennedy 
employed. Quarterback Mike McMullen (11), above, completed nine of 17 passes 
for 191 yards and one score before leaving after three quarters. Crenshaw, on 
the other hand, sputtered offensively. The Cougars tried two quarterbacks 
before turning the ball over to Thomas Redd, right. Redd (9), a junior, 
completed just one of 10 for two yards and threw two interceptions. See story,

BERNSTINE'S BLOCKING PANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't strain yourself looking for Rod Bernstine on the field. The former tight 
end, now a running back and sometime H-back, has played sparingly because of 
less-than-devastating blocking skills. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning received a plethora of letters from boosters in past 
weeks suggesting he could make better use of Bernstine at tight end. Henning 
offered a rebuttal Friday at a luncheon for Charger backers. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod Bernstine is a very versatile, good athlete," he said. "His blocking 
operation right now is minimal. If he were to be a big-time blocker, as a tight 
end with those types of receiving abilities, then you could put him in the game 
more often. You have to have a threat to be a blocker, or you'd better be a 
receiver that can beat the defensive back, because if they don't think you can 
block they put a defensive back on you and say 'OK, run.' So Rod is at that 
stage in his career that he needs to improve his blocking." 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Nate Lewis, second in the AFC with a 25-yard average in six 
kickoff returns, aggravated a shoulder injury in practice and is questionable 
for Sunday's game against the Houston Oilers at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Because Houston's run-and-shoot offense will tax Charger defensive backs, 
Henning had planned to use running back Darrin Nelson on the kickoff team in 
place of cornerback Donald Frank, who will play about three times more than 
usual. If Lewis can't play, he will be replaced by either Frank or wide 
receiver Anthony Miller. Nelson will fill the other spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can use Darrin in that capacity," Henning said. "We've seen pluses 
and minuses in Donald, and Donald is playing full-time now because of the 
run-and-shoot. We're trying to take as much of a load off those secondary guys 
for this game as we possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, from the one-stoplight town of Boyd, Tex., was 
brimming with Lone Star state pride Friday, and what better time with the 
Houston Oilers arriving in town. 
</P>
<P>
"What Texas needs to do is secede from the United States and run 
independently," he said. "Except it's such a great state and the United States 
needs it to survive. They would probably take the military in there and take it 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Safety Vencie Glenn doesn't plan to stand around too long watching from the 
sidelines. Glenn, who has started 54 consecutive games for the Chargers, will 
miss the Houston game because of a concussion he suffered against Cleveland 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a trip to the injured reserve list, Glenn said: 
"That isn't my decision. All I know is I'm not playing this week, and I'll be 
ready to play the next one." 
</P>
<P>
Lester Lyles will fill in at safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking it in stride," Lyles said. "I've been in this league six years, and 
these kind of things happen. I've been in this spot many times before. It's 
just a matter of keeping a cool head." 
</P>
<P>
In partial reaction to the sexual harassment charge Boston Herald sportswriter 
Lisa Olson has made against the New England Patriots, the Chargers decided to 
change the location of Henning's post-game interviews to allow an empty room 
for female sportswriters to conduct interviews outside of the dressing area. 
</P>
<P>
NFL rules allow women equal access to the locker room, and Henning said female 
writers will have the choice of entering the locker room or using the separate 
interview room. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to avoid the type of thing that possibly might have happened in 
New England," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Joel Patten, who had arthroscopic surgery before training camp, will be 
eligible to come off injured reserve Monday, but Henning said Patten will 
probably remain inactive to allow for further healing. "He feels like he could 
probably go," Henning said, "but the doctors are telling him that if he did go 
. . . he might only last three or four weeks, whereas if he waits awhile 
longer, his career might be longer too." . . . Cornerback Gill Byrd said 
doctors have still not determined the illness of his 6-year-old son, Gill Jr., 
who has been running a fever and suffering from sore joints the past two weeks. 
"They've taken a conservative approach, just doing blood tests and bone scans," 
Byrd said. "I think they may start taking a more aggressive approach and try to 
find out what is actually wrong." DON PATTERSON

Ted Koppel's decade-old ABC institution, "Nightline," is about to face some 
first-class news competition. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday at 11:30 p.m., CBS will pit Charles Kuralt and Lesley Stahl 
against "Nightline" with their own half-hour series, "America Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Just as "Nightline" grew out of reports on the Iran hostage crisis, the 
Kuralt-Stahl series is a product of their specials on the Persian Gulf 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
And for TV, the new CBS challenge to Koppel is an opening shot in a suddenly 
expanding network battle for the late-night -- in fact, all-night -- audience. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of Ted Turner's 24-hour CNN on the Big Three has never been so 
pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
By January, the news departments of ABC and NBC plan to join CBS -- which 
already has "Nightwatch" in the wee hours -- in offering programming that lasts 
until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
This week's CBS confirmation of the Kuralt-Stahl series, plus the announcements 
of the ABC and NBC expansion plans, are significant network steps. 
</P>
<P>
The result is hog heaven for news junkies. But it's also a major move by the 
declining Big Three to woo new viewers, reap untapped profits and win praise 
for worthy shows. 
</P>
<P>
Kuralt acknowledges that he and Stahl may have until only the end of the year 
to make their series a ratings winner. Some believe their nightly program may 
be strictly a stopgap until CBS finds a high-profile entertainment alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think this series will last," Kuralt says. "There's an audience for it, 
even against Ted's show. I think we'll do things so interestingly that people 
will find our program just as compelling as Ted's." 
</P>
<P>
Kuralt's job is to turn in "one solid piece each night. That's what they want 
me to do." 
</P>
<P>
And that means his trademark "On the Road" pieces are out for now -- no time -- 
although he'll continue his distinguished "Sunday Morning" series. 
</P>
<P>
While Kuralt will be based in New York, Stahl will remain in Washington, where 
she will also continue as anchor of "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
Koppel thinks of Kuralt and Stahl as "fine professionals, and I'm sure they'll 
do a fine broadcast," but he also knows that other factors probably encouraged 
CBS to start the new series. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, CBS' "Pat Sajak Show" failed, and late-night has since been a 
void for the network, prompting some of its stations to look toward syndicated 
replacements such as the Arsenio Hall program. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS has tried a number of different things over the past few years and none of 
them has worked," Koppel says. 
</P>
<P>
But, he adds, because "this is a time of high news interest in the Persian 
Gulf," it's a good move to go with something like the Kuralt-Stahl series. 
</P>
<P>
Says Koppel: "I think that what CBS is doing is an acknowledgement that 
whatever they've done hasn't succeeded, and if you're going to wind up with a 
smaller audience -- as all networks are -- you might as well get credit for 
what you do." 
</P>
<P>
As for ABC's planned 1-6 a.m. newscast aimed for a Jan. 7 start, and NBC's 
launch the same month of a 24-hour service providing stories for its local 
stations, Koppel says: 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me the networks are amortizing their expenses and using the only 
time they have left. Given the success of CNN, it was inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Koppel figures the networks may have been influenced in their expansion by the 
fact that CNN has been able "to make a go of it . . . even though CNN, in its 
most-watched hours, doesn't match network audiences in their least-watched 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
But CNN executive vice president Ed Turner says he's "mystified" by the 
networks' new late-night projects: 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the appetite? News has such a narrow audience anyway, except in 
crisis, and overnight it really falls off. And you've got CNN and Headline News 
and C-SPAN and maybe CNBC -- and probably all-news radio in major markets. 
</P>
<P>
"And now along comes NBC and ABC, plus CBS with its (Kuralt-Stahl) half-hour 
and whatever it does with Charlie Rose's old show ('Nightwatch')." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, however, and Linda Ellerbee -- both famous names in overnight TV -- 
believe that there's a strong appetite for news in the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's an audience out there," says Rose, who left "Nightwatch" this 
year to become anchor of Fox Broadcasting's new "Personalities" series. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a community of people in the middle of the night who want to be 
informed, engaged. They're looking for a companion, looking for stories. I'm 
very pleased to see (the expansion) happening. It's just television pushing the 
frontiers." 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbee, anchor of the "NBC News Overnight" series in the early 1980s, 
recalls: 
</P>
<P>
"When we were canceled, we were told there simply was not an audience. And we 
said, 'Oh yes, there is. You're not measuring it properly.' And then later on, 
the networks started saying they didn't think overnight audiences were being 
measured properly. I think the audience was always there." 
</P>
<P>
But now, she says, "The threat is bigger from CNN. Isn't it funny how we've 
seen it go from 'CNN will never last' to 'We want to be CNN'?" 
</P>
<P>
Each network has other reasons for expanding its late-night news. CBS is 
desperate to stop affiliate defection -- and hopes programs such as the 
Kuralt-Stahl series will carry over viewers to the network's low-rated "This 
Morning" show with Harry Smith and Paula Zahn. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, which says its 1-6 a.m. project still must win budget approval, is 
developing the show at the request of its stations. It plans to use two 
anchors, and affiliates would be able to carry from two to five hours, produced 
in 30-minute packages -- an apparent challenge to CNN's Headline News channel 
and its format. 
</P>
<P>
NBC is the strongest network in late-night with the Johnny Carson, David 
Letterman and Bob Costas shows. Its 24-hour news feed will simply supply its 
stations with raw material. But an NBC source says, "Once the service is up and 
running, we can begin to examine program possibilities. Everyone's getting a 
smaller piece of the TV pie, and we're looking for different sources of revenue 
anywhere we can." 
</P>
<P>
John Rohrbeck, general manager of KNBC Channel 4, says he's strongly in favor 
of around-the-clock programming: "There's an audience out there. A station must 
be on the air 24 hours a day. Any time a station signs off, it has to 
jump-start itself again."

NEW VISTAS OPENED BY FILM ON SEA LIFE

In "Seasons of the Sea," underwater photographer Howard Hall's first solo 
project, he attempts to convey the adventure and excitement of exploring the 
deep without the requisite photographer-surrounded-by-hunger-crazed sharks 
scenes, or the man-against-nature sequences that have become standard fare for 
underwater documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, filming people underwater is tedious," said the 40-year-old Del 
Mar-based Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Seasons of the Sea," which opens the ninth season of "Nature" on KPBS-TV 
(Channel 15), at 8 p.m., Sunday, instead focuses on the animals, showing the 
often bizarre behavioral patterns of creatures that inhabit or feed off the 
100-foot-deep kelp forest off the coast of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Its producers believe "Seasons of the Sea" will break new ground for underwater 
documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer David Heeley said he commissioned the hour-long film for 
"Nature" at a time when it seemed like all underwater producers are "doing the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"To be honest," Heeley said, "this is one of, if not the, most remarkable 
underwater film I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
In three years of filming in the kelp forests, Hall photographed spectacular 
scenes -- some of which had never been captured on film before -- from the 
tragic life cycle of thousands of squid to the birth of a shark, from the 
attack of a group of tiny sea urchins to the feeding of a giant blue whale. 
Except for a brief introduction, no humans are visible in the film. 
</P>
<P>
Through the photography, Hall tells stories about the animals, giving the film 
a dramatic base rarely found in underwater documentaries. Throughout, there is 
a sense of exploration and discovery. In one scene, the camera slowly slides 
through the kelp bed, discovering a lounging gray whale. The wandering of an 
octopus becomes a mini-drama when it survives an attack from a moray eel and 
loses a tentacle in the battle, only to be gobbled up a few minutes later by a 
passing seal. 
</P>
<P>
Hall used techniques more often employed by filmmakers doing documentaries 
about animals on land. He set up a tripod and staked out an area, observing the 
swirl of life and telling stories about the creatures' activities. He tracked 
some animals for months. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of swimming around and looking for pretty things to shoot, we went 
back to the same places and shot the same thing," said Hall, who has won four 
Emmys working on other people's projects. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see an underwater film you usually see the animals swimming and the 
narrator talks. Seldom do you see animals doing something." 
</P>
<P>
Hall says audiences and filmmakers have been so enthralled by scenes of 
underwater life, they haven't maintained the same quality standards on 
underwater documentaries imposed on films about Africa, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience wouldn't watch an African film if the animals didn't do 
anything," said Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive pre-production research and tips from local divers and fishermen 
helped Hall's crew, which often included his wife, Michelle, to be in the right 
place at the right time. However, he said many of the discoveries came as a 
complete surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Hall hoped to film bat rays mating, but he didn't know he'd come across a huge 
school of hundreds of bat rays lounging on the ocean floor. With the camera 
rolling, the bat rays slowly rose from the ocean floor, eerily blocking the 
moonlight with their huge winged forms. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminded me of scenes from 'The Wizard of Oz,' the winged monkeys flying 
across the dark sky," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
His greatest surprise came when he happened on a group of blue whales, the 
largest mammals on Earth, which are rarely seen off California. Hall's cameras 
captured a 100-foot-long blue whale munching on krill, it's massive throat 
enlarged, as it sucked in millions of tiny fish. 
</P>
<P>
"The blue whales were completely a fluke," said Hall, inadvertently punning 
with an ancient marine-biology joke. "If someone offered me $1 million dollars 
to film that sequence again I'd have to say I couldn't do it. There is no way I 
could get it again." 
</P>
<P>
A swimmer and diver in high school, Hall graduated from San Diego State 
University with a degree in zoology. To earn money during college, he taught 
diving through the Diving Locker stores. Chuck Nicklin, the owner of the Diving 
Locker and a veteran underwater cameraman for Hollywood film projects, enlisted 
Hall to work on the filming of "The Deep," which moved Hall toward a career as 
an underwater photographer. 
</P>
<P>
First, he free-lanced still photographs to nature magazines, eventually earning 
enough money to build his own underwater movie camera apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
"The film projects are just a vehicle to get me out there," Hall said. "It 
justifies going to great lengths to go to places. Even I wouldn't do it just 
for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Hall's list of credits is long and varied, working as a photographer, director 
and cinematographer for "Wild Kingdom," "National Geographic" and the BBC, in 
addition to several PBS and ABC film projects. He won cinematographer Emmys for 
ABC's "Spirit of Adventure" and "Tim McCarver's World of Adventure," and "3-2-1 
Contact" for PBS. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's co-produced several projects, "Seasons of the Sea" is his first 
solo production effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of frightening," Hall said. "I never wanted to produce films; it's 
taken a lot of the fun out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"But as you get older it's a natural evolution. It's almost unavoidable if you 
want to retire." 
</P>
<P>
Hall is already working on his next project for "Nature," a documentary on the 
Sea of Cortez. Already a year into the project, Hall is experimenting with 
different techniques, including an expensive "rebreather" system, which will 
allow him to stay underwater longer without producing the air bubbles that 
often distract his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"He's constantly looking for new ways to do something," Heeley said. "He's 
obviously so comfortable in the underwater environment that his imagination can 
take over." 
</P>
<P>
Like "Seasons of the Sea," the Sea of Cortez film will not have any footage of 
people interacting with the animals, nor will it contain the overt 
environmentalist message that permeates most underwater films. Hall said he 
prefers to let the beauty of the scene speak for itself, although the message 
is still there. 
</P>
<P>
"People look out there and they know so little about it and it's so beautiful," 
Hall said. "If you expose people to that they will have a greater desire not to 
dump stuff into it. 
</P>
<P>
"In doing this, we try to create a sense of value of the environment."

ECLECTIC WILD CARDS DESERVE A FULL HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While trying to cultivate a national following with exhaustive touring since 
1988, the Wild Cards haven't had the time, or the venue, to till their home 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Orange County band played to only 100 or so people Wednesday 
night at Peppers Golden Bear, the new club that has shown an admirable 
willingness to give local rockers a stage. 
</P>
<P>
The small turnout in this rare, local headlining appearance didn't stop the 
Wild Cards from putting on an intense, varied show. After nearly two hours that 
went from blues to salsa to calypso music to Latinized funk music, with detours 
into jump swing, a bit of shimmering soul balladry and even some rap and cool 
jazz, the Wild Cards had staked a strong claim for themselves as a dance band 
of the highest order. 
</P>
<P>
Half the material was drawn from the Wild Cards' upcoming second album, "Back 
it Up," which is due out in January on the independent Chameleon label. None of 
those songs stuck out immediately. It was hard to get a fix on lyrical content, 
partly because of the sound mix, but also partly because singer Adrian 
Remijio's syllable-bending, soul-blues phrasing didn't make for sharp 
enunciation. 
</P>
<P>
The new songs, like most of those on the Wild Cards' debut album, "Cool Never 
Cold," seemed to lack the roundhouse pop hooks that radio programmers look for. 
The Wild Cards do work within fairly narrow melodic boundaries that could bear 
some stretching. Remijio is a solid, but not exceptional, singer. His voice 
recalls the huskier side of Stevie Wonder, but aside from a good falsetto, he 
didn't show the full arsenal of textures and tones that a first-rank soul 
singer could muster. 
</P>
<P>
If Remijio does have it in him, vocally, to make the leap from good to 
exceptional, we could have a Chicano Robert Cray on our hands. Judging from his 
inspired, generous playing at Peppers, Remijio already has the guitar genius 
half of the Cray equation pretty well covered. 
</P>
<P>
There were echoes of B.B. King's clean, taut style, and Carlos Santana's 
dramatic, Latinized blues in Remijio's playing, but those were just starting 
points. Through solo after extended solo -- and he seemed to be soloing much of 
the time -- the guitarist with the hill of curly black hair kept finding ways 
to remain fresh and inventive. Remijio would change tempos, shift textures, and 
move from darting, sharply articulated lead runs to deft, high-impact chording. 
There were moments during his chordal gliding when it sounded as if a reed or 
woodwind instrument had gotten mixed up in the Wild Cards' basic lineup of two 
guitars, bass and drum. Remijio accomplished all this without flash, wasted 
energy or ostentation. 
</P>
<P>
He was hardly the entire show. Jesse Reyes got in his share of complex rhythm 
guitar licks, did his usual amazing leaping, whirling dance breakdown, and even 
rapped a little -- an overly trendy touch, perhaps, but one he executed with a 
convincing, full-bodied bellow. New member Luis Oliart seems to be the answer 
to the problem the band has had in keeping a suitable, steady bassist (Oliart 
is the third bassist to join since original member Johnny Frias left the band 
about two years ago). He contributed to the Wild Cards' signature '40s-style 
harmonies that always sounded creamy yet punchy, played a supple bass and was 
an enthusiastic presence on stage. 
</P>
<P>
You can't have a first-class dance band without a first-rate drummer. Jesse 
Sotelo Jr. played with the snap and assurance of a big-band drummer, driving 
the beat along and spicing it with cowbells and timbales to lend a Latin 
rhythmic spin. 
</P>
<P>
With four players who each built interesting rhythmic structures, sharp, full 
harmonies that broadened the sound, and a dynamic soloist at the heart of it 
all, the Wild Cards sounded as big as a basic four-piece can. Trying to 
categorize them is fruitless (they're sort of like a more bluesy Kid Creole 
&amp; the Coconuts, without the big-band horns and jokes). Maybe it's best just 
to think of the Wild Cards as body music with soul. 
</P>
<P>
The Tearjerkers, who opened, have a promising premise: Blend the 
R&amp;B-flavored girl-group harmonies of the early '60s with pure-pop, slightly 
psychedelic styles from the mid- to late-'60s. The three contrasting female 
voices hit a nice harmony blend, although their solo efforts were inconsistent. 
The songs offered some clever takes on the war between the sexes. Still, the 
55-minute set dragged. The Tearjerkers' sort of pop has to be played with the 
utmost exuberance and tight rhythmic snap, and that spark in the rhythm section 
just wasn't there. That proved fatal as the Tearjerkers settled into a long 
slog through slow and medium-tempo songs from which they never emerged.

'GOOD GRIEF': A NOT-SO-WISE UNDERTAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The new Fox comedy series "Good Grief" is as funny as a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Premiering at 9:30 p.m. Sunday on Channels 11 and 6, it's about funerals, in 
fact, starring Howie Mandel as sleazy Ernie Lapidus, whose attempts to impose 
his used-car-salesman mentality on Sincerity Mortuary outrages his 
brother-in-law (Joel Brooks), who ran the dignified family business on his own 
until Ernie married his sister (Wendy Schaal). 
</P>
<P>
The opening story finds Ernie hawking the mortuary in TV commercials and 
scheming to confiscate a fancy sports car that a client was buried in and 
replace it with a Pinto. 
</P>
<P>
This half-hour is a Pinto -- all chromed up with a gyrating hula girl in the 
rear window and a pair of fuzzy dice hanging from the rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
In the second episode -- which introduces Ernie's con-artist friend Ringo (Tom 
Poston) -- Ernie announces that he will honor a transvestite's request to be 
buried in a dress, shocking the dead man's family. The concluding eulogy is 
grating witlessness. They should have buried this script. 
</P>
<P>
Put "Good Grief" in the category of good ideas left in the oven too long. 
Instead of approaching Evelyn Waugh's grossly funny satire of the burial 
business in "The Loved One" and its ensuing movie version, "Good Grief" gives 
you only the gross. Instead of black humor, you get only the black -- endless 
overbaked gags accompanied by laughter that sounds as if it was run through an 
echo chamber. Better a cremation chamber. HOWARD ROSENBERG

Catholic collegiate officials were relieved this week when Pope John Paul II 
issued a document on Catholic universities that appears to respect academic 
freedom even as it challenges them to adhere to church teachings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted," said Sister Magdalen Coughlin, provost of Mt. St. Mary's 
College in Los Angeles and for many years its president. "The language tends to 
be non-legal, non-judgmental. It seems to be a responsive and responsible 
document." 
</P>
<P>
American Catholic university presidents had reacted strongly against the first 
draft produced in 1985, saying they felt that the U.S. traditions of academic 
freedom and autonomy from church interference were endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Coughlin was one of 18 U.S. delegates who conferred in April, 1989, in Rome 
with Vatican officials on the document. The changes suggested by delegates from 
various countries were well-received at the time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the original draft had spelled out hundreds of norms, now there are 
only seven," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-word work is titled "Apostolic Constitution of the Supreme Pontiff 
John Paul II on Catholic Universities." 
</P>
<P>
Jesuit Father Thomas Rausch, professor of theology at Loyola Marymount 
University in Los Angeles, cautioned that the constitution's statement 
guaranteeing academic freedom for members of the university was qualified by 
the phrase "within the confines of truth," a phrase he said was not in last 
year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
"A theologian would want to raise the question of who determines what is truth, 
especially in theology. That is the area of recent controversies on dissent and 
Catholic scholarship," Rausch said. He added that much depends on how key 
sentences are interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rausch indicated he was pleased with the document's "vagueness" on a 
debated question of whether theologians at all Catholic universities need to 
have formal, licensed mandates from Rome. Most in this country do not, although 
such a procedure is required by the church's canon law. 
</P>
<P>
Rausch said the papal writing also shows the enthusiasm for Catholic education 
that might be expected from a former university professor. Rausch also said he 
was pleased by the "ecumenical sensitivity" in the constitution's respect for 
the religious rights and beliefs of many non-Catholics teaching at Catholic 
institutions.

AUTHOR LOOKS AT SEARCH FOR RELIGION IN GREAT OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE J. LEONARD, Leonard, associate professor of interdisciplinary 
humanities at San Francisco State, recently wrote Emerson, Whitman and 
Conceptual Art (Philosophy and Literature, Johns Hopkins University Press.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catherine Albanese argues that "nature religion," not Christianity, has been 
the religious center of America culture. 
</P>
<P>
Albanese, a respected UC Santa Barbara professor, tries to shake the word 
"religion " loose from lifeless Sunday pieties. She fights the common belief 
that ours is a "secular society." She agrees that the old channels through 
which spiritual ferment used to express itself -- the churches and synagogues, 
the anthropomorphic religions -- have silted up. Yet Albanese would show 
American society only superficially secular: the "search for the Sacred refuses 
to go away." 
</P>
<P>
Since the days of Emerson and Thoreau, many have insisted that Americans were 
more likely to reach the awe-filled, renewing experience of the Sacred while 
walking along the ridges of our mountains than sitting in a pew on Sunday; that 
America's true shrine is not the Crystal Cathedral but the Grand Canyon; that 
Christmas may now be a shopping spree and Easter a spring break -- but to see a 
spiritual reaction come over an American face, mention Yosemite, mention the 
redwood forests. "Heaven knows that John the Baptist was not more eager to get 
all his fellow sinners into the Jordan," John Muir wrote, "than I to baptize 
all of mine in the beauty of God's mountains." 
</P>
<P>
In Albanese's pages, Emerson, Thoreau and John Muir emerge as the church 
fathers of America's living religion. Muir "steeped himself" in Emerson and 
Thoreau, then translated their philosophy into the Church Militant. Muir, the 
father of our national park system and the Sierra Club, was a conscious 
theologian who pictured himself as a new "John the Baptist eating Douglass 
Squirrels &amp; wild honey or wild anything" descending from "the divine 
wilderness" to "preach the green brown woods to all the juiceless world . . . 
crying, Repent for the Kingdom of Sequoia is at hand." 
</P>
<P>
Albanese suggests roots for this American religion in the Algonkian Indian 
religions that the first New England settlers encountered. She uncovers lively 
American nature religions in herbalism, hypnotic healing, homeopathy, the 
"spiral dance" of San Francisco witches celebrating The Old Religion of the 
Goddess and in the 1850 Davy Crockett Almanac's joyous identification with the 
powers of nature: "I can walk like an ox, swim like an eel . . . spout like an 
earthquake, make love like a mad bull. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Albanese has the gift of being able to bring out the significance in virtually 
anything, and she writes beautifully about the oddest topics. My only 
reservation concerns her decision to approach contemporary American amateur 
physicians purely as a religious phenomenon, never asking for documentation of 
"cures." 
</P>
<P>
Albanese's important work puts the 1990s' religious ferment in perspective. She 
helps us understand what overtook Americans, almost to our own surprise, on the 
20th anniversary of what may become a great religious festival, Earth Day: our 
feelings of reverence for the sacredness of the Earth.

NUTS AND BOLTSRESIDENTIAL POOLS TAKE ON LOOK OF SMALL OASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Staying on the cutting edge, status-wise, can be a real chore around here. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody was just getting used to drinking Perrier with lime when it suddenly 
became de rigueur to lug around a big bottle of fashionably non-carbonated 
Evian and take frequent and flamboyant pulls on it. 
</P>
<P>
Then the '65 Mustang becomes a retro gold mine, and now people can't junk their 
Beamers fast enough. And if anybody discovers how really swell a Patek Philippe 
watch is, all those clunky Rolexes are going to mainspring heaven. 
</P>
<P>
So it's a real pity about those poor folks with back-yard pools big enough to 
dry dock the Exxon Valdez. They're un-chic. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, in the contemporary world of today's Southern Cal back yard, the Lake 
Huron-size pool, shaped like a pancreas and complete with diving board, slide, 
racing lane dividers, rubber inflatable beach toys and a cabana full of 
whooshing and gulping machinery is . . . out. 
</P>
<P>
 Small is in. 
</P>
<P>
These days, pool buyers are looking for something that looks less like the 
municipal plunge and more like a private oasis. 
</P>
<P>
"People are really trying to customize their pools," said Elizabeth Nelson, a 
spokeswoman for the National Pool and Spa Institute. "Years ago, in the '50s 
and '60s, there were only a couple of kinds of pools: rectangular or 
kidney-shaped. Now we have better technology and there are a lot more options. 
A lot of them are being designed like a home resort, customized to a person's 
lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
That lifestyle has become somewhat minimalist in Southern California, at least 
more so than in the days when having a built-in pool meant kissing the grass 
goodby, paving over the back yard and plunking a large and unadorned 
8-foot-deep pool into the center of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Today's typical pool is smaller, shallower and a lot more interesting to look 
at than its cousins from 30 years ago, said Jay Bullard, president of Aquarius 
Aquatech Custom Pools and Spas in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The depth of the average built-in is now around 5 feet, he said, and diving 
boards and slides are no longer considered standard equipment because of 
owners' worries about injury and liability. Instead, potential buyers want 
bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every residential pool we build comes with a spa these days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many pool buyers now have less space to work with. Lots of yards, 
especially new yards, are smaller than they were 25 years ago, Bullard said. 
</P>
<P>
More buyers, then, are settling on what the industry often calls a "play pool" 
-- something to lounge around in and occasionally splash a little water. And, 
since they're not going to be doing any serious lap swimming or diving, one of 
the principal selling points of that type of pool is scenery. 
</P>
<P>
"People are looking for the aesthetic value of a pool," Bullard said. "That 
tends to be a big factor." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, with new technology, aesthetics can mean almost anything. For 
instance, he said, one of the most significant pool landscaping trends in the 
last five years has been the use of artificial rock, made from molded concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of thing you see at Disneyland," Bullard said. "They'll find 
interesting rock formations out in the field and make latex molds of them. 
Rather exotic looks are developed as a result. It allows for installation of 
what appears to be far larger boulders, and waterfalls can be made more 
watertight." 
</P>
<P>
The aesthetics now encompass even the interior lining of the pool, he said. "It 
used to be just plaster," he said. "Then it evolved to colors of plaster, which 
you still see. Now there's Pebble Tec." 
</P>
<P>
A brand name, Pebble Tec is finely graded smooth rock. It is, Bullard said, 
"like looking at smooth pebbles in a creek through running water, and it's much 
more durable" than plaster. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, more expensive than plaster, to the tune of about $2,500 for an 
average-size pool -- that in addition to the $25,000 price tag that Bullard 
said is the statistical average for a back-yard built-in with an adjoining spa 
and "the normal amount of decking and masonry." 
</P>
<P>
You can ease some of the sting, however, by installing one of the new 
generations of circulating pumps. Today, Bullard said, it's possible to buy a 
pump for your spa or pool that has two speed settings. Running the pump on low 
speed, he said, will circulate the water half as fast as high speed, but will 
only cost one-sixth as much to operate. 
</P>
<P>
And if your pool happens to be fashionably small -- which means a small surface 
area -- you can put less demands on your pool heater, Bullard said. 
</P>
<P>
For the true minimalist, however -- the aspiring channel swimmer with a back 
yard about the size of a lifeboat -- there is the swim spa. Slightly larger 
than a normal spa (about eight to 12 feet long), the swim spa is fitted with 
two or more jets at one end that create a current of water to swim against. It 
is, however, a Sisyphus-like exercise; you are literally swimming in place. 
</P>
<P>
If this turns into exercise-aversion therapy, however, you can always stop 
swimming. Tell anyone who's watching that those pesky pool contractors forgot 
to put jets in the other end of your unusually large spa. Then smile and take a 
big slug of Evian.

U.S. GEARING FOR CUTBACKS OF $85 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As things stand now, if Congress and the White House fail to reach a budget 
agreement by midnight Sunday, the federal government will have to slash its 
spending by a staggering $85 billion, causing sharp cutbacks in services that 
will quickly be felt by millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp reductions in money for programs -- and the furloughing of thousands of 
federal employees -- would disrupt commercial air traffic, reduce access to 
national parks, cause delays at ports of entry and trigger shortages of fresh 
meats, weather forecasts and even coins. 
</P>
<P>
That is but a sampling of the potentially far-reaching consequences of a 
continuing budget stalemate that could, under the Gramm-Rudman deficit 
reduction law, mandate unprecedented across-the-board spending cuts throughout 
the federal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Even mail delivery, which relies on commercial night flights, would probably be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Budget Director Richard G. Darman ordered all department heads to 
be prepared to close down their agencies Monday morning if negotiators do not 
reach a budget accord by the Sunday night deadline. He said passage of a 
stopgap spending bill was "unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
Some essential services or agencies are exempt from the automatic cuts -- 
including salaries for military personnel and benefits under Social Security, 
disability and workers' compensation, Medicaid, food stamps and most other 
welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
But, even in those areas, the widespread furloughing of federal employees is 
likely to cause sharp reductions in business hours, delays in processing of 
applications and possibly huge backlogs that could affect government services 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
There are these examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some of the most severe effects of the spending cuts would be felt by the 
nation's air traffic control system, where cutbacks in work hours of air 
controllers would force cancellation of about 3,000 scheduled flights a day.

KEY ISSUES STALL DEAL ON BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: THE MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCKS ARE SOCIAL SECURITY AND TAXES. BUT BUSH MAY 
AGREE TO A SHORT POSTPONEMENT IN MONDAY'S AUTOMATIC CUTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
White House and congressional negotiators inched closer to a deficit-reduction 
accord Friday in hopes of heading off $85 billion in mandated federal spending 
cuts on Monday, but they remained at an impasse on key issues, such as Social 
Security and capital gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A key Republican leader said that if a budget deal seems within sight over the 
weekend, President Bush may agree to a short postponement of the automatic 
spending cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman law to avoid a crippling shutdown of 
government services on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"But they must be very, very close to a package before the President would sign 
off on that," cautioned the GOP leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member negotiating team prepared to work today and Sunday, if 
necessary, to strive for an agreement that has been eluding the two sides since 
Bush convened the talks last May. 
</P>
<P>
Even before an accord was reached, however, both Democratic and Republican 
leaders voiced apprehension that Congress may not accept a five-year, 
$500-billion deficit-reduction package containing a variety of new tax 
increases and a dramatic cutback in the popular Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, told House Republicans that the 
Bush Administration was "very close to a deal," but he said that important 
issues remain unresolved, including how to make sure that Congress abides by 
any new spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), addressing the Democratic caucus in 
the House, received a standing ovation after he urged his fellow party members 
to be patient in the climactic stages of the bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
But a key Democratic aide said the outlook was "grim," since the negotiations 
were still snagged so close to the Monday deadline. "We're not as close as we 
would like to be," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who attended a presentation by 
Sununu and Budget Director Richard G. Darman, said afterward: "They did not 
deny that they are miles apart on enforcement. . . . It sounds like they are 
miles apart on a deal, unless they are willing to accept one without teeth." 
</P>
<P>
Cox also noted that disclosure of details of the package -- both in news 
reports and by White House officials -- was not reassuring to the GOP caucus. 
"It would be very difficult for the leadership to get Republican votes for a 
package that is looking increasingly ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources disclosed that variations of President Bush's proposal for a 
sharp cut in the capital gains tax rate were still being discussed, along with 
Democratic counterproposals for offsetting tax increases for people with 
incomes above $100,000, who would receive the greatest benefit from such a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said Democrats suggested excluding 30% of capital gains 
-- profits from the sale of stocks or other assets -- from taxation, while 
Republicans pressed for excluding 40%. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the two sides remained split on how heavily to tax ordinary 
income of upper-bracket taxpayers. Democrats sought to increase the top tax 
rate on ordinary income from the current 28% to a new level of 32%, while GOP 
negotiators wanted to limit it to 31%. 
</P>
<P>
White House negotiators, meanwhile, dropped a proposal to index capital gains 
to offset the impact of inflation on profits from the sale of stocks and other 
investments. GOP sources said that the restrictions proposed by Democrats would 
reduce its effectiveness as a stimulus to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu told about 30 Republican House members that a reduction in capital gains 
tax rates was "neither off nor on" -- a sign that the negotiations were still 
in flux. But he said that any agreement would have unspecified "growth 
incentives" even if capital gains provisions were not included, a GOP 
participant said. 
</P>
<P>
The White House also was reported to be resisting any changes in Social 
Security payments, dropping an earlier proposal to delay a cost-of-living 
increase for three months following protests from Republicans in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, however, were pushing for taxing 85% of Social Security benefits for 
retired persons with incomes of more than $25,000 for an individual and more 
than $32,000 for a couple. 
</P>
<P>
A wide gulf separated the negotiators on the issue of enforcement -- an issue 
that is little understood, but it is important to lawmakers who want to nail 
down the spending cuts both sides have tentatively agreed to make in the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) demanded that the summit bargainers 
allow a group of GOP House members to review an agreement for 24 hours before 
unveiling it to the public, to make sure it deserved the party's backing. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu reportedly gave assurances that Gingrich and other participants in the 
broader budget summit talks would have a chance to give their opinions before a 
deal was finally concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fairly optimistic reports from the negotiating teams, Democrats 
prepared fallback positions in case the talks collapsed or hit a major snag. 
</P>
<P>
House Democrats were expected to ram through an alternative budget of their own 
in an extraordinary session of Congress on Sunday when they also will seek to 
pass a bill that would delay automatic spending cuts and keep funds flowing to 
the government through Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, however, has threatened to veto any such delaying action if there is no 
accord at the budget summit or if the talks collapse. If his negotiators 
recommend an extension of five or seven days, Bush would agree, one GOP leader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BUDGET SHOWDOWN: THREE SCENARIOS 
</P>
<P>
As negotiations continue on a long-range pact to pare the federal deficit, 
government agencies and employees are bracing for the possibility of severe 
funding cuts and furloughs on Monday. While the outcome remains far from 
certain, officials say one of three basic scenarios is likely to unfold over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
SCENARIO ONE: CRISIS AVERTED 
</P>
<P>
White House and congressional negotiators reach agreement on a plan to cut the 
deficit by $500 million over five years, with a $50-billion reduction during 
the 1991 fiscal year that begins on Monday. The agreement contains a 
combination of spending cuts and tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passes a stopgap "continuing resolution" to keep the government 
operating at current funding levels for several weeks, giving lawmakers time to 
pass 1991 appropriations measures and enact tax increases and benefit 
reductions. President Bush signs the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution waives provisions of the Gramm-Rudman law that would require 
severe spending cuts, effective Monday. The waiver is necessary because the $50 
billion in cuts for 1991 fall far short of the deficit reduction called for 
under the law. 
</P>
<P>
SCENARIO TWO: WIDESPREAD CUTS 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators fail to devise a deficit reduction accord before Monday. Congress 
passes a continuing resolution to keep the government in business for several 
weeks, but leaves out the Gramm-Rudman waiver to avoid a presidential veto. 
Bush signs the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman process known as "sequestration" begins Monday. Funding for 
defense and a wide variety of domestic programs is cut by about one-third. More 
than 1 million federal employees have their working hours reduced and many 
government services are disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Safety net" programs are spared from the cuts, including Social Security, 
Medicaid, food stamps, child nutrition, supplemental food, federal retirement, 
disability and workers compensation. Medicare cuts are limited, and interest 
payments on the national debt continue. 
</P>
<P>
SCENARIO THREE: GOVERNMENT CLOSES 
</P>
<P>
The budget negotiations collapse. Congress passes a continuing resolution in an 
effort to keep government operating and to waive the Gramm-Rudman sequestration 
process. The measure is vetoed by Bush, and Congress is unable to override. 
</P>
<P>
The government effectively shuts down on Monday. Agencies close, employees stay 
home, benefit payments cease, and bills go unpaid until White House and 
congressional negotiators can reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The President could elect to keep some essential government services operating 
by invoking the provisions of a 10-year-old legal opinion that authorizes 
emergency funding at his discretion.

ALTERNATIVE-FUEL CARS TO CALIFORNIA ROADS.

<P>
The state Air Resources Board on Friday approved revolutionary tailpipe 
emission standards, a move expected to result in millions of electric and other 
alternative-fueled cars on California roads beginning in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The tough standards, approved on an 8-0 vote in Los Angeles, are expected to 
have dramatic implications for California motorists, automobile manufacturers 
and oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1998, 2% of all new cars sold in California -- an estimated 40,000 
vehicles -- must be electric powered. By the year 2003, 200,000 cars -- 10% of 
all new cars sold -- would have to be electric powered. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, far greater numbers of other cars powered by cleaner burning 
methanol, ethanol or compressed natural gas are expected to be on the road 
because it is believed that those fuels are the only ones that can comply with 
the stringent new standards, the toughest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The new standards will slash tailpipe emissions in half beginning in 1994. Over 
the next five years, the standards would progressively tighten until every new 
car sold would be from 70% to 100% less polluting than cars produced in 1994. 
Cars built before 1994 would not have to meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the plan hailed its approval and called it a major step toward 
finally bringing California's smoggiest urban areas into compliance with 
federal clean-air standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we took a gigantic step forward today. We will have to wait and see if 
we put all the right pieces together," ARB Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless said 
after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Lents, executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, added: "To me, it's just a revolutionary change from where we were 
three years ago to having a proposal on the table today that will get the job 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute changes to meet objections from oil companies and automobile 
manufacturers appeared to ease their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on board," said Samuel A. Leonard, director of automotive emission 
control for General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
While automobile and oil companies questioned how much public acceptance 
alternative-fueled cars would have, backers of the plan predicted a strong 
market because of widespread concern about the environment. 
</P>
<P>
But, they stressed that alternative fuels must be competitively priced and at 
least equal to gasoline in performance. Executives of electrical and natural 
gas utilities enthusiastically endorsed the program. 
</P>
<P>
Two years in the making, the unprecedented mandate will set the tone for 
California's war on smog into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Without the stringent new tailpipe standards, many of the state's smoggiest 
urban areas, including Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties, will never be able to comply with federal clean-air standards, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the clean-air gains in a sweeping plan approved last year by 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District depended upon Friday's action. 
The regional clean-air plan calls for new controls on everything from power 
plants to back-yard barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
The four-county South Coast Air Basin has the most polluted air in the United 
States. The basin exceeded the federal health standard for ozone an average of 
137 days in both 1987 and 1989. At times, levels of the pollutant, which 
reduces lung capacity and causes respiratory illness, are three times higher 
than the federal standard allows. 
</P>
<P>
The standards are expected to wield considerable influence beyond California. 
</P>
<P>
New York on Thursday informed automobile makers that only cars meeting 
California's 1993 tailpipe standard can be sold in that state. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring California's influence on the national scene, New York 
Environmental Conservation Director Thomas C. Jorling endorsed the ARB's action 
and said approval of the plan "strengthens New York's resolve." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, virtually every new car sold in California 10 years from 
now must be from 70% to 84% less polluting than 1993 models, which will still 
be the cleanest cars in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The phase-in of progressively cleaner cars will begin as early as 1994. By 
1997, they would account for one out of every four new car sold, and by 1998 
would account for half of all new car sales. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2003, every car sold in the state -- about 2 million a year -- 
would be required to be at least 70% less polluting than the conventional 1993 
model, and 10% of the cars would have to be electric powered. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile executives said it would be difficult but not impossible to meet the 
new standards. A number of companies are already said to be on the "fast track" 
in developing an electric car. For example, General Motors has produced a 
prototype of an electric vehicle, called the "Impact" that is said to match 
gasoline-powered automobiles in performance. In addition, major automobile 
companies are working to turn out vehicles that can run on any combination of 
methanol and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB did not rule out technological breakthroughs in gasolines if they meet 
the same tailpipe standard. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with government mandates and competition from alternative fuels, major 
oil companies have embarked on a crash program to develop ultra-clean gasolines 
to preserve their market share. 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of remaining in business, service stations would be required by 
the state to sell cleaner alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Market demand would determine when service stations would have to make 
alternative fuels available for sale. Until 1997, only major oil companies 
refining at least 55,000 barrels per day and owners of 25 or more service 
stations would have to meet the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
In the first year, 90 stations in the South Coast Air Basin would make the fuel 
available, growing to 400 stations by the third year. There are 6,000 gasoline 
stations in the Basin. 
</P>
<P>
But, after intense pressure from major oil companies -- spearheaded by Los 
Angeles-based Arco -- the board struck down a staff recommendation that would 
have essentially required retail service stations and oil companies to meet an 
alternative-fuel sales quota. 
</P>
<P>
The move was a potential setback for methanol enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the ARB staff called for such quotas on grounds that if an 
alternative fuel such as methanol cost more than gasoline, customers whose new 
cars could run on either gasoline or methanol would buy the cheaper, more 
polluting gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
But oil companies argued that they would have to artificially lower methanol's 
price to make it competitive and make up the difference by charging higher 
prices for gasoline. They said this would be a "hidden subsidy" borne by owners 
of gasoline-powered cars. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol industry officials, however, said that the wholesale price of their 
fuel was just 73 cents a gallon. They said it would remain competitive provided 
service stations did not unrealistically mark up the price. 
</P>
<P>
"When the price of crude oil went up, methanol did not," said Ray Lewis of the 
American Methanol Institute, a trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB served notice, however, that if alternative fuel sales did not go well, 
it reserved the right to impose sales quotas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ASSESSING THE IMPACT 
</P>
<P>
What the new vehicle tailpipe standards approved by the state Air Resources 
Board will mean to: 
</P>
<P>
MOTORISTS: A wider choice in the cars they drive. Automobile makers are 
expected to be forced to turn to alternative fuels like methanol, ethanol, 
compressed natural gas and electricity. But some of these fuels will not 
provide the mileage that gasoline offers. It takes 1.7 gallons of methanol to 
get the same mileage as a gallon of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOBILE MAKERS: Manufacturers must produce 40,000 electric-powered cars 
beginning in 1998, rising to 200,000 a year in the year 2003. They are also 
expected to turn to other alternative fuels and/or a new generation of smog 
controls like electrically-heated catalytic converters. During the next 10 
years, new alternative-fueled cars will be from 70% to 84% cleaner than 
conventional gasoline cars to be sold in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
OIL COMPANIES: Gasoline's long dominance of the market is at stake. Unless oil 
companies develop cleaner-burning gasolines, they will see their market eroded 
by alternative fuels. Fuel companies in the methanol business as well as 
natural gas and electrical utilities are pushing hard for vehicles that use 
their fuels.

JERUSALEM: A CITY STILL DIVIDED; 
</P>
<P>
IT IS NO LONGER SEPARATED BY BARBED WIRE, BUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIER IS NO 
LESS REAL. FEAR AND DISTRUST PERMEATE THE JEWISH WEST AND ARAB EAST SECTORS.

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Israeli paratroopers in 1967 broke through the golden-gray stone walls and 
conquered the Old City, sacred ground to three great religions, Israeli leaders 
vowed that Jerusalem would never again be divided. 
</P>
<P>
But the fractious mood among Palestinians and Israelis provoked by the Persian 
Gulf crisis, piled on top of the nearly three-year-old intifada, the 
Palestinian uprising against Israeli control of the areas captured in 1967, has 
cruelly underscored how badly those hopes have been shattered. 
</P>
<P>
While the city is no longer separated by barbed wire and military checkpoints, 
as it was from 1949 to 1967, it is cleaved by a psychological barrier no less 
real. 
</P>
<P>
"I sense that the city is more divided than ever," said a Western diplomat with 
long service here. "It remains deeply split by religion, culture, language and 
nationalism." 
</P>
<P>
Before 1967, the Old City and the rest of East Jerusalem were under Jordanian 
control. The Israelis quickly annexed the newly captured sectors, reasserting 
that the reunified city was the capital of the Jewish state. Neither the United 
States nor the international community accepts that declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea in 1967 was to create a mosaic here with all these different peoples 
living harmoniously together," the diplomat said. "That idea has failed. And 
the gulf crisis has emphasized that East Jerusalem is simply an occupied 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
Though there is now no dotted mark on any contemporary map separating Jewish 
West Jerusalem from Arab East Jerusalem, nearly everyone knows where that 
"green line" is. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, there was a constant flow back and forth of Jews and Arabs 
between the East and West sectors, and crossing the green line was a daily 
occurrence for many. On Friday nights, as Jewish businesses in West Jerusalem 
closed for the Sabbath, nonreligious Israelis would cross to the East to dine 
in Arab restaurants along Saladin Street, or at non-kosher places such as the 
Philadelphia, and drink in other bars and discos. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be great fun," recalled an Israeli journalist not known for 
timidity. "But now, I wouldn't go into Arab Jerusalem except on business during 
the day. I feel a definite uneasiness because of the mood there." 
</P>
<P>
And an Arab journalist reports a mirror-image feeling: "I avoid going into West 
Jerusalem when possible. I'm not exactly frightened -- but I would be very 
nervous if my car broke down over there. It's a definite concern." 
</P>
<P>
Both men say that friendships between Arabs and Jews have withered because of 
the sharply increased feeling of separation. 
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Mayor Meron Benvenisti, who worked diligently under Mayor Teddy 
Kollek to bind the city's wounds, today is blunt about the now-evident failure 
of efforts to create Arab-Israeli harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the city is divided," he said in an interview, "more deeply than 
ever. Actually, it was always divided, but the split was submerged. People 
didn't want to see that. We wanted to believe in an illusion, a myth." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Aghazarian, history professor at Birzeit University in the West Bank 
city of Ramallah, sipping coffee in a garden, mused about Jerusalem and the 
current Israeli government, led by the hard-line Likud Party: "There was a 
delicate balance in this city, and the right-wing Likud has fractured that 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
And Amos Alon in his recently published book "Jerusalem: City of Mirrors" 
writes: "The contest in Jerusalem between Muslims and Jews, Arabs and Israelis, 
is not merely tribal, not only over territory but over psychological space." 
</P>
<P>
Aghazarian, Alon, Benvenisti and others say that it took first the intifada and 
now the Palestinians siding with Iraq's Saddam Hussein to shatter the myth of a 
united Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Now the two parts of the city even run on different time: Jewish West Jerusalem 
has shifted back to standard time, but Palestinians in East Jerusalem continue 
to observe daylight time. 
</P>
<P>
"We are an hour ahead of them," commented a doctor at the Arab Mokassad 
Hospital, adding with dark humor, "and 50 years behind." 
</P>
<P>
It is not hard to see where Jewish areas end and Arab quarters begin: The 
former are normally neat and tidy, with new houses and apartment buildings and 
clean streets. Much of Arab Jerusalem has a dilapidated look, with dusty 
streets, unfinished-looking homes and uncollected garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The Arabs maintain that they have been treated as third-class citizens in their 
own city, unable easily to build homes or offices and hobbled in their 
businesses by Israeli regulations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hurly-Burly 
</P>
<P>
However, Jerusalem city officials such as Bonnie Boxer, spokeswoman for Mayor 
Kollek, argue that since Arabs refuse to vote in municipal elections or serve 
in local government, they must expect to be left behind in the hurly-burly of 
democratic competition for shares of a hard-pressed city budget. 
</P>
<P>
While she does not admit that Jerusalem is divided, Boxer agrees that there "is 
much less flow between the two parts" these days. 
</P>
<P>
Boxer said Jerusalem's 1989 population was 504,600, of whom 361,300 were Jews. 
The non-Jewish population was 143,300 -- Muslim except for about 15,000 
Christians, half of whom are Christian Arabs. This amounts to growth of 89% 
from the city's 1967 population of 267,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city's area is now 26,000 acres, up from 9,390 acres before the Israeli 
annexation. Part of that growth is due to careful expansion designed by the 
Israel authorities to ensure that Jews remain a majority in Jerusalem. New 
Jewish neighborhoods have been built to surround Arab areas, a fact that 
incenses many Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Kollek, 79, who has been mayor since 1965, is the city's firmest and best-known 
advocate of unity. He has prepared, one after another, "master plans" for the 
city that would give the Arab population new housing. But those plans have been 
invariably rejected by the national government. 
</P>
<P>
Boxer readily admits that Arabs have a valid complaint that their housing needs 
have been systematically ignored by the government. When Kollek argued that the 
Old City's Muslim Quarter should be rebuilt, as was the Jewish Quarter, the 
national right-wing government refused to provide the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor can't change a stop sign or bus stop without approval of the 
national Transport Ministry," she said as an illustration of the power that the 
national government has over city affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fractious History 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has never been an easy town to govern; it has a long and fractious 
history. Over the centuries, control shifted from Philistines to Jews to 
Babylonians to Persians to Romans. 
</P>
<P>
In AD 70, after a Jewish rebellion against the Romans and a long siege of the 
city, the Roman general Titus, who later become emperor, sacked the city and 
destroyed the Second Temple, leaving only the Western Wall. While Jews remained 
in Jerusalem, the city became a focus of Christianity as the place where Jesus 
had been condemned and executed. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Jerusalem was conquered by the Muslims sweeping out of the Arabian desert 
in the 7th Century. According to Islamic beliefs, the Prophet Mohammed visited 
the city, ascending into heaven from the Temple Mount, making the city sacred 
to Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening centuries, Jerusalem and the Holy Land were dominated by 
Muslim dynasties -- the Fatimids, the Mamelukes and the Ottoman Turks -- except 
for the 12th Century when the Christian Crusaders, having established the Latin 
Kingdom of Jerusalem, ruled from the city for almost a century. 
</P>
<P>
Turkish control was ended when British troops fighting the Turks in World War I 
entered Jerusalem in 1917. The British administered the city until the 1948-49 
Israeli War for Independence, which left it divided, with the western part soon 
to become the new capital of Israel and the east, including the Old City, left 
in Jordanian hands. 
</P>
<P>
Under Jordanian rule, the Western Wall was allowed to deteriorate, the street 
at its foot was used as an animal run and Jews who remained in their quarter of 
the Old City were repressed. 
</P>
<P>
But on June 7, 1967, the Old City was taken by Israeli forces. The paratroop 
commander, Col. Motta Gur, radioed ecstatically: "The Temple Mount is in our 
hands. Repeat, the Temple Mount is in our hands." The world saw pictures of 
paratroopers weeping for joy at the Western Wall as the chief military rabbi 
blew the shofar, or ceremonial ram's horn. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers sang the song: "Jerusalem of Gold," and the politicians vowed that 
the city would be "eternally" united. Within weeks, Israel formally annexed 
East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever accommodation the Jewish and Arab communities reached with one another 
in the years that followed have been all but submerged by renewed hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
Rancor between the communities has increased to the point that physical 
evidence of the divisions are reappearing. Barbed wire has been erected by 
Israelis in the northern neighborhood of Neve Yacouv, where there have been 
incidents of stone-throwing with Arabs in the abutting neighborhood of Dahiet 
al Bariyed. The Arabs say they are victims of Israeli violence, targets of 
regular rock-tossing forays at the edge of their community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division Is Clear 
</P>
<P>
The division between the two peoples in the Old City itself is clear at the 
Damascus Gate in the massive limestone wall, the main entryway into the Muslim 
Quarter of the Old City. There are no Israelis, who tend to enter through the 
western Jaffa Gate. 
</P>
<P>
In a gun port in the wall from which, centuries ago, defenders rained arrows 
and hot oil on attackers, an Israeli soldier slouches, rifle at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
Below, in the mornings before shops close, all is noise, bustle, and color: 
Arabic music, pushcarts piled high with figs and aubergines, a dozen aromatic 
spices and varieties of nuts and olives. 
</P>
<P>
"To us, this is the real city, where the Jews don't come," said a Palestinian 
guide. "The Israelis can't understand why we like the flavor of this scene. 
They want us to be more orderly. It's a clash of cultures." 
</P>
<P>
Down busy, narrow Al Wad street, a 30-year-old storekeeper named Farid Hassan, 
who sells carved wood figurines and brassware, shows a visitor his 
mother-of-pearl money box. It is empty. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no business," he said. "It doesn't matter if I'm forced to close in 
the afternoon because of the intifada. Many tourists don't want to come this 
far into the Old City, certainly not Jews. The situation is very, very bad. The 
Israelis don't recognize that we want Jerusalem to be our Palestinian capital, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
A few doors south toward the Via Dolorosa, with its Stations of the Cross, sits 
the house, over a tunneled archway, that was bought by Housing Minister Ariel 
Sharon. Sharon, a former general and a hard-liner opposed to bargaining away 
any of the territory seized in the 1967 war, created the chief point of 
contention in the Muslim Quarter when he first moved into the house in 
December, 1987, days after the intifada began. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Muslim Quarter view his presence as a provocative intrusion. 
Militant Israelis see it as an assertion of millennial Jewish rights, arguing 
that Jews have the right to live anywhere they choose west of the Jordan River, 
including the Muslim Quarter in the Old City. Theirs is a deeply held attitude 
that is bitterly disputed by Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Sharon house, three border policemen in green berets guard the door 
and chat among themselves in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
Across from his portal is a bakery shop, whose vendor, a young man named Sami 
abu Subieh, sells tasty pastries and candied doughnuts. Subieh reports that 
business has plummeted since Sharon's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lost about 70% of my business since he came," said Abu Subieh, 20. 
"People don't feel comfortable with the soldiers. They might get harassed. It's 
easier to shop elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
When Sharon actually shows up to spend a night in the house, which is decorated 
with a menorah and Israeli flags -- once every three or four months, according 
to Abu Subieh -- the guard increases to about 100 men. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Via Dolorosa is a weathered three-story building that houses a yeshiva 
run by the group called Ateret Cohanim, with about 150 young Jewish students, 
of whom about 95 live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, a bearded man with glasses who is dean of the religious 
school and came to Israel 20 years ago from Paris, said: "All this land is our 
land. Israel belongs to the Jewish people. We were thrown out by the Romans 
into exile, but we came back. So we have a special reason to be here." 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi said he hopes to boost the percentage of Jews in the Old City, which 
currently has about 4,000. Most live in the Jewish Quarter and are Orthodox 
Jews, many of them originally from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Aviner said the school and its students have good relations with their Muslim 
neighbors, including a Palestinian family that lives downstairs. But the 
62-year-old grandmother of that family, Insaf Najib, sees the relationship 
somewhat differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever they clean up, they let the water wash down on us, never thinking of 
us below," she said. "Otherwise, they don't bother us. But we don't talk to 
them. Our door is closed to them. Their door is closed. We don't speak each 
other's language." 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole country is under occupation," added her daughter Ibtihat, "so what 
does it matter about a school upstairs?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anger Over Lease 
</P>
<P>
Over in the Christian Quarter, residents are upset about the purchase of a 
lease to the venerable St. John's Hospice by militant Jewish groups who have 
taken the place over for permanent residence. They moved in just before Easter 
and placed the Star of David over the original Christian insignia sculpted in 
the stone facade. 
</P>
<P>
After a bitter confrontation, the matter was taken to the courts for a 
still-pending adjudication on whether the seller of the lease had proper title 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs will never acquiesce to the regime imposed upon them," said a 
pessimistic Meron Benvenisti. "Violence courts violence. At Jerusalem's heart, 
a time bomb with a destructive force of apocalyptic dimensions is ticking in 
the form of the Temple Mount." 
</P>
<P>
Temple Mount to Jews -- and Haram Al Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) to Muslims -- is 
the site of the destroyed First Temple completed by King Solomon in the 10th 
Century BC and the Second Temple finished by King Herod the Great in the 1st 
Century BC. Now it is also one of Islam's holiest places, site of Mohammed's 
ascension to Heaven, a superlative 7th Century architectural ensemble crowned 
by the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa mosque. 
</P>
<P>
Some militant Jewish sects advocate destroying these Muslim shrines in order to 
prepare for a Third Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, clashes among religious militants have been frequent around 
this lovely precinct. 
</P>
<P>
In such a harmonious surrounding -- exquisite ceramic facades shimmering in the 
sun, golden and silver domes, graceful arches, splashing fountains, a breeze 
ruffling the cypress and pines, set between the Mount of Olives to the east and 
the Western Wall to the west -- the troubled words of author Amos Alon seem 
incongruous yet so accurate: 
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is once again what she has been so often in her history: a city at 
war with herself. If anything, Jerusalem is a city loved too well, yet never 
quite wisely." 
</P>

The House on Friday passed a $44-billion, three-year spending authorization 
bill for NASA that includes President Bush's proposal to place a settlement on 
the moon and to begin work on a manned expedition to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration bill includes no money for 
the moon and Mars programs in the next fiscal year but would spend $444 million 
on them in fiscal 1992 and $649 million in fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The bill won approval on a voice vote after a brief debate. It goes to a 
conference committee to work out differences with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides a three-year spending authorization to enable NASA to make 
longer-range plans, including space shuttle missions, space exploration and 
development of expendable launch vehicles and an experimental high-speed 
aerospace plane. 
</P>
<P>
The House passed a multiyear authorization last year, but the Senate never took 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Bush proposed last year that NASA establish a permanent settlement on the moon 
and begin a 30-year project to send a manned expedition to Mars by the year 
2019. The bill authorizes the Bush Administration's request for the start of 
the project.

The special counsel to the Senate Ethics Committee has recommended that no 
action be taken against Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) in 
an S&amp;L case, a congressional source disclosed Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The counsel recommended that the committee proceed with an investigation of the 
three other senators who intervened with regulators on behalf of Arizona 
savings and loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr., the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The other senators from the "Keating Five" group are Donald W. Riegle Jr. of 
Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Alan Cranston of California, all 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation by special counsel Robert S. Bennett, a Washington lawyer, 
was made Sept. 10, but the committee has been unable to decide whether to 
accept it, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The source discussed what he knew about Bennett's recommendation on condition 
that his congressional affiliation not be disclosed. He said he did not know 
the basis for the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's staff director, Wilson Abney, refused to discuss the matter 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn's press aide, Rebecca Bell, and McCain's press aide, Scott K. Celley, 
said their senators had not been told of any recommendation to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Keating controlled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, Calif., whose failure 
has been estimated to cost taxpayers $2 billion. His family is from Ohio; he 
had a hotel project in Michigan and his principal corporation operated in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
He contributed $1.3 million to the campaigns and causes of the five senators, 
and the committee is trying to determine whether their intercession with 
regulators trying to close Lincoln was improper. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, charged with fraud in the sale of more than $200 million in risky junk 
bonds, is in jail in Los Angeles, unable to make $5-million bail.

THE ARTS: IN OPENING STATEMENTS, PROSECUTOR SAYS THE 1ST AMENDMENT ISN'T AN 
ISSUE. DEFENSE ARGUES THAT THE PHOTOS ARE TROUBLING BUT IMPORTANT.

<P>
The prosecutor in a precedent-setting obscenity trial told jurors Friday that 
they have the opportunity to "draw the line" on pornography, banishing it from 
museums and art galleries just as it now is barred from Cincinnati's movie 
theaters and video stores. 
</P>
<P>
In the nation's first prosecution of an art gallery on obscenity charges, the 
jury was told that 1st Amendment free expression rights are not an issue in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"The only issue," prosecutor Frank Prouty said in his opening arguments, "is 
whether or not these seven pictures are in violation of the law." 
</P>
<P>
The seven photographs in question were among 175 works by Robert Mapplethorpe 
displayed for seven weeks last spring at the Contemporary Arts Center in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury found the photographs obscene last April and charged the center 
and its director, Dennis Barrie, with two counts each of pandering obscenity 
and using minors in nudity-related material. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the photographs depicted aspects of a sadomasochistic gay lifestyle. 
The two photographs showing minors were portraits in which the subjects were 
partially undressed. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys on Friday sought to portray the 50-year-old center as a 
respected cultural institution that brought "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect 
Moment," a retrospective exhibit, to Cincinnati for its artistic and cultural 
value. 
</P>
<P>
H. Louis Sirkin, Barrie's attorney, described Mapplethorpe as an important 
artist whose often beautiful but sometimes troubling work provides glimpses 
into his own soul and into an underground gay lifestyle that flourished in New 
York in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
It is "a world that existed in a period of American history that we may never, 
never have again and perhaps should never have again," Sirkin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Art is not only to be pleasing to the eye," Sirkin said. "Art is to tell us 
about ourselves, to make us look at ourselves and to tell us something about 
the world around us. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular artist not only did beautiful pictures," he said. "He did 
other pictures that were not so beautiful, but they were pictures of a world 
that he was a part of." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said of the exhibit, which traveled to several cities and now is 
in Boston: "It was not brought here to appeal to anyone's prurient interest. It 
was brought here to teach and to show, to show the world this brilliant 
photographer and some of the inner workings of this man and also some of the 
torture that perhaps he suffered." 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe died last year of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Before the start of opening statements, the eight jurors and two alternates 
were escorted to the downtown arts center. They were ushered just inside the 
door by a bailiff and allowed to look around for less than a minute before they 
were led back to a bus. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the courtroom, they received capsulized lessons in aesthetics and in 
the sadomasochistic sexual practices Mapplethorpe depicted. One witness, police 
officer David G. Ruberg, testified about sexual practices in the gay community 
and described events leading up to the serving of indictments at the center on 
April 7, the day the exhibit opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The jury consists almost entirely of working-class men and women from the 
suburbs who do not often visit art galleries or museums. Only one of the eight 
jury members has a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, prosecutor Prouty told the jury: "There has never 
been a museum or art gallery or whatever charged with displaying obscenity. 
There has never been an institution where the obscenity issue has come up in 
these circumstances. Therefore you have a chance to decide on your own where do 
you draw the line. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The question becomes ultimately, 'Are these the kind of pictures that should 
be permitted . . . in an art gallery or any place?' " 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers tried to show that the art center had taken voluntary measures 
to ensure that no one under 18 would see the exhibit. They also said the center 
filed a lawsuit two weeks before the show opened in which it sought a ruling on 
whether any of the photographs were obscene by community standards. The lawsuit 
was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Before the start of trial, Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge David J. 
Albanese issued two rulings that damaged the art center's case. In one ruling, 
issued earlier this month, he said that only the seven photographs described in 
the indictment are to be considered by the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Sirkin and Marc Mezibov, the art center's attorney, argued that the entire 
175-piece exhibit should be studied by the jury because of a 1970 U.S. Supreme 
Court ruling that said, in part, that works of art must be judged "as a whole" 
in obscenity cases. 
</P>
<P>
Albanese ruled that each photograph is a complete work unto itself, which means 
essentially that Barrie and the center may be convicted if only one photograph 
is found to be obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Albanese's other important ruling came earlier when he determined that the art 
center does not satisfy the Ohio statutory description of a museum. Without 
this ruling, the prosecution could not have proceeded because museums are 
exempt from Ohio's obscenity statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his ruling, Albanese himself inadvertently referred to the center as a 
museum Friday, as did the prosecutor and defense attorneys.

OFFICERS WORRY AS SAUDIS STILL CURB LIVE-FIRE TRAINING; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: FEW U.S. SOLDIERS GET TO PRACTICE WITH REAL AMMUNITION UNDER DESERT 
CONDITIONS. ARTILLERY NEEDS ARE STRESSED.

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. military commanders, struggling to keep a sharp fighting edge on their 
troops in a difficult environment, are increasingly concerned about 
Saudi-imposed rules that prevent most American soldiers from training with live 
ammunition -- even in remote desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the restrictions, U.S. officials say, many American units 
deployed in the Persian Gulf crisis are able to prepare for possible combat 
less thoroughly than they could back at their bases in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Seven weeks after their deployment began, the bulk of American forces still 
have had no opportunity to test-fire their weapons, even though they face the 
imminent possibility of combat under unfamiliar and challenging circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely hoping for more, and we're pursuing it," one ranking U.S. 
source said Friday, "but we're getting nowhere fast." 
</P>
<P>
Live-fire practice is especially important for the military's heavy artillery 
batteries and main battle tanks. Both would be pivotal in any clash with Iraq's 
massive forces, and they would need to calibrate their weapons and make other 
adjustments to adapt to the challenges of desert warfare. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions have become a point of contention between U.S. and Saudi 
officials and a source of rising concern for field commanders, who regard 
training with live ammunition as an important part of combat readiness. 
</P>
<P>
In what military officials described as the most frustrating example to date, a 
scheduled exercise involving the 82nd Airborne Division was canceled at the 
last minute Friday after Saudi officials said the Americans had not obtained 
proper clearance. 
</P>
<P>
The American officials conceded that the Saudi limitations are not the only 
barrier to the heavy use of live-fire exercises that combat leaders would like. 
Supplies of U.S. ammunition remain limited, and most of it is being reserved 
for use in case of war. But officials said that, while available supplies of 
ammunition would not permit extensive live-fire practice, the Saudi barriers 
prevent even the minimal level of such training they consider essential. They 
note that the Saudi government has set aside only a single live-fire range for 
the use of more than 100,000 American troops. 
</P>
<P>
So limited are the opportunities for troops to test their weapons that many 
U.S. forces "won't know how things work until the shooting starts," one Army 
commander said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials declined to discuss the reason for the restrictions, but U.S. 
sources said one concern has been that the use of live ammunition, and the 
unexploded shells that result from such exercises, could endanger nomadic 
desert herdsmen. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the U.S. officials asserted, the restraints are part of a continuing 
Saudi effort to ensure that the American forces remain as low-profile as 
possible to avoid feeding Arab concerns about the potential despoliation of 
Muslim holy sites. 
</P>
<P>
The curbs mean that entire front-line Army divisions and most of a Marine 
expeditionary force have yet to train with live ammunition, while the Air Force 
has not fired at all. Only Marine M-60 tanks and artillery and about half of 
the 82nd Airborne have had a turn on the firing range. 
</P>
<P>
The limited training, described in interviews with a wide range of military 
officials, contrasts sharply with widely distributed television footage of 
American troops and weapons unleashing a barrage of fire against mock enemy 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
The first live-fire exercises began Sept. 12 after extensive negotiations 
between U.S. and Saudi officials. Because of frequent photo opportunities, the 
training exercises sent an important symbolic message. But commanders said its 
military effect has been more limited. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about lack of realistic training is a common complaint in the military, 
particularly in foreign countries, where host governments tend to impose more 
severe restrictions than field commanders would like. U.S. forces based in 
Germany may go more than six months between live-fire exercises, one Army 
official noted. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do what we always do," the official said. "We'll train around it." 
</P>
<P>
But commanders said they regard the problem as far more serious in Saudi 
Arabia, where conflict appears more likely than it has in other theaters and 
where the harshness of the environment may cause weapons to malfunction in 
unexpected ways. 
</P>
<P>
The limited size of the firing range and its location a considerable distance 
from the front have contributed to an uneven mix of units permitted to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Marine tanks were able to calibrate their heavy weapons after long 
storage aboard Navy ships, the similarly important forward-based M-1 tanks from 
the Army's 24th Mechanized Division have had no such opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Marine ground troops stationed close to the front have been 
provided no live-fire practice whatsoever while the 82nd Airborne, whose forces 
have pulled back to rear positions, has been using the range for nearly two 
weeks.

U.S.-EUROPEAN SPLIT STALLING JORDAN AID PLAN 
</P>

<P>
A split between the United States and its European allies is stalling plans to 
aid Jordan, one of the countries suffering most from the effects of U.N. 
Security Council sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The split became public Friday as Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, 
current chairman of the European Community, briefed reporters on the Europeans' 
increasingly independent foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Although De Michelis did not discuss the difference directly, he said that 
foreign ministers of the European Community's 12 nations will discuss 
implementation of the sanctions against Iraq at an extraordinary session in 
Rome next week. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to De Michelis, speaking on condition that they not be identified, said 
one of the chief issues at the Rome meeting will be how to assist Jordan, hard 
hit by the embargo of the nation that was its biggest trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was poised last week to adopt a $2-billion aid plan for 
Jordan, but the proposal was sidetracked by the United States, European 
diplomats said. They asserted that Washington is overly influenced by Saudi 
Arabia and Kuwait, both angered by King Hussein's public support of Iraq and 
his private assurances to them just before the attack on Kuwait that Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein had only peaceful intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Although they say they understand Saudi outrage over Jordan, the Europeans are 
concerned that failure to rescue the Hashemite kingdom will topple its monarch 
and bring a radical regime to power that could extend Iraqi influence to 
Israel's borders. For this reason, they said, De Michelis hopes to persuade the 
European Community to help to Jordan without waiting for the United Nations to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Open support for this policy came from Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, 
whose government is not a member of the European Community but has long been 
active in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jordan were to be destabilized, Saddam Hussein would be on the border of 
Israel, in a position to widen his Arab support," Mock told journalists at a 
luncheon. "This is sometimes underestimated in the West." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the large number of jobless Jordanians, together with the influx 
of 200,000 impoverished refugees from Iraq and Kuwait, are potential recruits 
for revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the West should do anything so that Jordan is not destabilized," Mock 
advised. "One or the other country might be irritated by King Hussein's 
personality, but they are not seeing the long-range problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mock said he attempted to deliver his message in talking with Kuwaiti officials 
and will make the same case when he meets with Saudi leaders, but he was 
uncertain about their receptivity. 
</P>
<P>
De Michelis said the financing of the European aid to nations strongly affected 
by the sanctions also will be on the table at next week's gathering in Rome. He 
dismissed the claims of some members who have contributed troops, ships or 
aircraft to Persian Gulf forces and are seeking to offset their costs through a 
European Community assessment for aid. Asked if there will be a move toward 
burden-sharing, he replied: "The (European) Community believes military 
spending is a national decision." 
</P>
<P>
De Michelis deflected questions about coordination of European military 
contingents in the gulf, saying that the organization has no military 
functions, only economic and political. 
</P>
<P>
"Our official position is that we have the possibility to arrive at a political 
solution (in the gulf)," he said. "We are trying to achieve the total political 
isolation of Iraq."

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
The exiled emir of Kuwait told President Bush that Iraq is pillaging his 
country and repopulating it with outsiders, jeopardizing the prospects of 
restoring the former government even if Iraqi forces withdraw. After the emir's 
two-hour session at the White House, U.S. officials said the timetable for 
possible military action against Iraq is shortening. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of nations are prepared to consider the use of military 
force if economic sanctions fail to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait, Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III said after consulting with foreign leaders at the 
United Nations. Most countries would prefer any military action to be 
coordinated by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, fearful of jeopardizing U.S. ties with China, has 
rejected an offer by the government of Taiwan to contribute $100 million to the 
cost of the Persian Gulf military buildup, U.S. officials said. Washington 
urged Taiwan to provide assistance instead to "front-line" nations that have 
been hard hit by the international embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of Iranians, some shouting "Death to America," demonstrated in Tehran 
and other Iranian cities to denounce the military buildup in the Persian Gulf, 
according to radio reports. The protesters also condemned Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military commanders in Saudi Arabia are concerned that the 
combat-readiness of their troops has been compromised by Saudi-imposed rules 
prohibiting use of live ammunition in training exercises. Although some 
exceptions have been authorized, many soldiers still have not had the 
opportunity to test-fire their weapons, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Michael J. Dugan, the Air Force chief of staff who was fired Sept. 17 for 
discussing with reporters details of U.S. air-strike plans against Iraq, has 
been given a new job as special assistant to Air Force Secretary Donald Rice, 
an Air Force spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Israel and Egypt of setting up an intelligence station in Israel's 
Negev desert to monitor the movement of Iraqi troops. The Iraqi army newspaper 
said the station was financed by the former rulers of Kuwait, by the Saudi 
government and the United States.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III, completing four days of intense 
high-level diplomacy, said Friday that growing numbers of countries are ready 
to consider the use of military force to end Iraq's invasion of Kuwait if 
peaceful means prove inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the start of a meeting with Tunisian Foreign Minister 
Habib Boulares, Baker said most members of the United Nations hope that the 
Persian Gulf crisis can be resolved peacefully but that "there are a number of 
countries that make it quite clear that we should not foreclose (military) 
options." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the number has increased this week after his discussions with more 
than two dozen foreign ministers, Baker said, "I think there are more countries 
that are willing now to express that view." 
</P>
<P>
So far, most foreign leaders who have spoken out publicly on the subject have 
said they would favor the use of force only if authorized by the U.N. Security 
Council, usually a time-consuming procedure. 
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Security 
Council -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- 
issued a statement late Friday pledging to act quickly in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The ministers stressed the importance of a further development of the ability 
of the Security Council to respond quickly to challenges to international peace 
and security," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued after a private lunch with Secretary General Javier Perez 
de Cuellar, reiterated the demand for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait without 
conditions and without delay. 
</P>
<P>
A senior French diplomat said that existing Security Council resolutions do not 
permit offensive action by the U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf region. 
But he pointedly added, "The legal framework may change. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger is that in a few weeks' time, the embargo will not have produced 
any effect," the French official, who spoke on the condition he not be 
identified by name, said. "At that point, the international community must 
decide if it will step up the pressure another notch. The only next notch is 
the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
"With the measures that have been taken so far and the kind of equipment that 
has been put in, one can imagine what it might look like," the official added. 
"There are more than 600 combat aircraft on the spot. That gives you air 
superiority. One would assume that those aircraft would be used. They are not 
there for an air show." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Turkish President Turgut Ozal, whose country shares a long 
border with Iraq, said his government would take part in U.N.-sanctioned 
military action against the Baghdad regime. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tunisia's Boulares told Baker that Hussein does not yet believe that 
the world is serious in its condemnation of the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. official, Boulares, who met with Hussein on Sunday in 
Baghdad, said Tunisia and neighboring Algeria are trying to convince Iraq that 
the United Nations will persist in its effort to reverse the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Tunisian reported that Hussein was convinced he could ride out U.N. 
sanctions, noting that the world organization has been unable to force South 
Africa to end its policy of apartheid or to require Israel to withdraw from the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh, briefing Baker on Syrian President Hafez 
Assad's just-concluded visit to Tehran, said Iran will continue to support the 
economic embargo of Iraq despite its repeated condemnation of the presence of 
American and other foreign troops in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior U.S. officials confirmed that Baker has assured Israeli 
Foreign Minister David Levy that the United States will respond militarily if 
Hussein follows through on his threat to attack Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq attacks Israel, the United States will respond immediately and 
forcefully against Iraq," one senior official said. "There are more than 
100,000 American forces in the area. They are there to defend against Iraqi 
aggression. If there is Iraqi aggression against Israel, obviously, they will 
be used." 
</P>
<P>
Another senior official said: "We have a commitment to Israel that is rock-hard 
and unshakable. There is nothing new in that. If there is a threat to Israel, 
that commitment comes into effect." 
</P>
<P>
Although Israel receives almost $2 billion a year in military assistance from 
the United States, it has never asked for American troops to fight in any of 
its wars against its Arab adversaries. However, the officials said, Washington 
would certainly respond to any request for help from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has urged Israel to maintain a low profile in the gulf crisis 
in order to avoid antagonizing Saudi Arabia and other moderate Arab nations 
that are part of the international consensus against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze spent about 90 
minutes trying to persuade Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan to tighten the 
Hashemite kingdom's compliance with economic sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Baker and Shevardnadze had engaged in such 
two-on-one diplomacy since Washington and Moscow found themselves on the same 
side of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Hassan indicated that there is very little give in Jordan's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"No country should be expected to commit hari-kiri in observing sanctions," he 
said.

Serbia's ruling Communists adopted a new constitution strengthening their 
control over Yugoslavia's largest republic. 
</P>
<P>
The document gives greater power to its Marxist president and virtually ends 
autonomy for ethnic Albanians. The 136-article constitution was approved by the 
single-party, 250-member Serbian Assembly at a special televised session that 
marked a major step in the Communists' efforts to retain power by revamping 
their image and exploiting rising Serbian nationalism. The republic's first 
free elections in 45 years are set for Dec. 9 for the legislature and 
president. Six main opposition parties have threatened to boycott the voting.

Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh fended off pressure to scrap 
plans to help low castes as police shot and killed six people and a student 
committed suicide in protests across northern India. Indian news agencies said 
that a conclave of Singh's party, Janata Dal, renewed majority backing for his 
plan, which would raise the quota of government jobs reserved for outcastes and 
low Hindu castes from 22.5% to nearly half. Party leaders who had pressed him 
to compromise won consent only to pursue talks aimed at persuading upper-caste 
students to end seven weeks of violent protests, the news agencies said.

Several hours of heavy fighting between government troops and forces loyal to 
rebel leader Prince Johnson shattered a six-day cease-fire in Monrovia, the 
Liberian capital. Artillery and machine-gun fire shook the city before dawn as 
government troops fired at random from the presidential mansion. Up to 1,000 
soldiers still loyal to the late President Samuel K. Doe are trapped in the 
mansion, between the lines of rival rebel factions.

BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT MOVING SWIFTLY TO STIMULATE, TRANSFORM COUNTRY; 
</P>
<P>
LATIN AMERICA: BOLD STEPS OF THE LAST SIX MONTHS ARE STIRRING EXCITEMENT -- AND 
UNCERTAINTY.

BRASILIA, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Fernando Collor de Mello, 41, likes to drive fast cars and 
motorcycles. He has even taken the controls of a supersonic jet fighter on one 
of his much publicized weekend outings. And during the week in his Planalto 
Palace office, Collor is also a man in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
He has ordered a bold series of measures during his first six months in office 
that are rapidly changing the government and economy of this country. As Brazil 
absorbs the changes, brisk cross-currents of excitement and uncertainty are 
sweeping the nation of 150 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Collor's critics call him rash and authoritarian. But with his forceful 
personality and his public relations skills, he has kept the hopes of most 
Brazilians high so far, opinion polls indicate. 
</P>
<P>
He has also wasted no time in his efforts to win overseas support. On a 
whirlwind tour before taking office, he met with President Bush, Japanese, 
Soviet and European leaders, and he is scheduled to meet again with Bush in 
Washington on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
While it is too early to assess the ultimate success of his leadership, Collor 
is clearly in the driver's seat as Latin America's largest nation speeds toward 
a future that, for better or worse, will bear his indelible mark. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the ride has not been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Collor's tough anti-inflation measures, the economy is in a 
slump that government officials refuse to call a recession even though it has 
all of the earmarks of one. Meanwhile, prices continue to rise at discouraging 
monthly rates of more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Collor acknowledges that the tough part is not over. 
</P>
<P>
But the difficulties are part of the process of change, he insists. What 
matters most, he tells Brazilians, is that his administration is stripping down 
and reforming a bloated and sluggish government, overhauling an outdated 
industrial sector, opening up the overprotected national economy to the 
stimulus of the global market, and preparing Brazil to move up as quickly as 
possible from Third-World underdevelopment to First-World economic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Collor is part of a pattern across Latin America and elsewhere around the 
world: From Mexico City to Moscow, national leaders are putting new emphasis on 
private enterprise, free trade and lean government in the universal quest for 
economic progress. But in few Western countries has the transformation begun 
faster than in Brazil under Collor. 
</P>
<P>
That is partly because of strong, pent-up popular demand for change after 21 
years of military government and a five-year transitional period before Collor 
took office March 15. An economic crisis, including inflation of 84% in the 
month before his inauguration, added to the urgency. And his own impatient, 
action-oriented style has kept things clipping along since then. 
</P>
<P>
"President Collor runs his government as if he were an executive of a 
multinational corporation," commented the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo. "He 
likes to make decisions instantly, he is always calling in promises, and he is 
convinced that time is money -- rarely do conferences surpass the limit of 15 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Critics label Collor's fondness for recreational speed as exhibitionism, but 
many analysts see it as part of the president's deft public relations efforts 
to project an energetic, macho image that will help maintain popular support 
for him and his often painful reforms. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey published early this month by Ibope, Brazil's top polling firm, 60% 
of those interviewed said they trusted the president, and 79% said he was doing 
a fair, good or excellent job. 
</P>
<P>
David Fleischer, an American-born political science professor at University of 
Brasilia, is critical of Collor but gives him high marks in public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing very well in terms of publicity and rhetoric," Fleischer said. 
"Good communications and marketing skills got him elected." 
</P>
<P>
Collor's election victory last December capped a phenomenally successful media 
campaign that began when he was the obscure governor of a small, poor state in 
northeastern Brazil. As a presidential hopeful, he drew increasing public 
attention by lambasting corrupt politicians, overpaid and lazy bureaucrats, and 
cozy businessmen who depend on official favors. 
</P>
<P>
But in Fleischer's view, Collor is part of the "old system," interested only in 
changes that favor the established social and political order and supported in 
Congress by "exactly the same group that he berated so much during his campaign 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
Before he became president, many people were skeptical of Collor's will to make 
changes that would favor Brazil's poor majority and disturb the dominant elite 
by altering the status quo. A foreign banker who was one of the skeptics now 
says: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a convert. I think Collor really does want to change things. I think he 
really does represent a new wind in this country." 
</P>
<P>
The banker said Collor's actions have proven his determination to break venal 
relationships between big business and government and to demand efficiency in 
public administration. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandre Barros, a political scientist who works as a consultant to private 
investors, said opinions about Collor in the Brazilian business community have 
swung radically since mid-March, when the new president froze most deposits in 
the financial market and warned high-profit monopolies and oligopolies that 
their free ride was ending. 
</P>
<P>
"At first there was total perplexity," Barros said. Then, when inflation 
rapidly subsided and business picked up, there was lot of optimism based on 
"wishful thinking," he said. "I think that now people have a more balanced 
view." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Collor's industrial policy, which includes a phased reduction of 
import barriers, pleases many businessmen but worries others looking for 
protection from foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic in the middle term, because I think Collor's policies are 
going in the right direction," Barros said. But in the long run, he predicted, 
underlying problems such as deficient educational and health care systems for 
the Brazilian masses will retard development. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are less optimistic about Collor's prospects for getting 
inflation under control, a step considered essential for healthy economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Collor and his economic advisers blame the persistence of the inflation on a 
society that accepts rapid price increases as normal and on businessmen who 
fail to cut costs and refuse to reduce profits. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation has not gone down because we still have some reticence on the part 
of certain businesses to assimilate the changes," said Joao Cunha, 
undersecretary of economy. But Cunha predicted in an interview that the 
government policy of tightly restricting the money supply eventually will force 
businesses to hold down prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certain that by the end of the year we will have inflation well below 
the level of 10% a month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The monetary policy has dampened economic activity, while inflation is eating 
away at real wages. Most independent economists are calling the slump a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not say we are in a recession," Cunha said. "I would say we are 
entering a phase of reduced activity." 
</P>
<P>
The degree of reduction will depend on the cooperation of business, unions and 
consumers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The official goal is to stabilize inflation at 2% to 3% a month by the end of 
the year. "If we achieve stabilization, after the first quarter (of next year) 
I feel we can start thinking about growth again," Cunha said. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, workers are clamoring for raises in their eroded salaries. The press 
has reported more than 500 strikes since March. A power strike put out the 
lights in Brasilia for 10 hours, even darkening Collor's residence. 
</P>
<P>
Collor's reforms began the day he took office, when he reduced the number of 
government ministries from 24 to 12, and since then he has kept up an 
almost-steady barrage of measures. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
Ministries have dismissed, retired or furloughed more than 250,000 of the 
government's 1.6 million workers. 
</P>
<P>
Collor has ordered the sale of 42 luxury homes, formerly provided as 
perquisites to ministers and other senior officials, as well as 20,000 
apartments for bureaucrats, 4,500 cars and five airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Plans have been made to auction off scores of government-run corporations. The 
first sales have been delayed until early next year, but a recent presidential 
decree ordered government-run companies to reduce spending by 25% across the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The president has reduced military spending from 6% of the national budget to 
2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Collor's Economy Ministry has begun eliminating import restrictions and 
lowering customs duties so that foreign goods may compete on the Brazilian 
market, helping to keep prices competitive, and imported machinery and 
components can be used to improve the quality of Brazilian products. 
</P>
<P>
A new government program will provide $3 billion in financing for development 
in science and technology over four years to make Brazilian industry more 
competitive internationally. 
</P>
<P>
The economic team has reached a preliminary agreement with the International 
Monetary Fund that foresees $2 billion in stand-by credits for Brazil. The IMF 
agreement is regarded as a preliminary step for renegotiating Brazil's 
$117-billion foreign debt, which has not been serviced for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
In its letter to the IMF, the government says it will have a surplus in its 
budget this year, wiping out the deficit Collor inherited in March. 
</P>
<P>
A literacy program will invest $600 million this year and next in teaching 25 
million illiterate Brazilians to read and write.

A study has found 74% of Chicago's inner-city children have witnessed a 
slaying, shooting, stabbing or robbery, and experts worry about the impact such 
violence has on youngsters' mental health. 
</P>
<P>
"People think if they're chronically exposed to this kind of violence kids 
adapt to it," said Dr. Carl Bell, a psychiatrist at the University of Illinois 
School of Medicine. "But they're wrong. If children who witness crimes appear 
withdrawn or silent, it's a symptom of the damage. They just shut off." Bell 
heads the Community Mental Health Council, which conducted the study.

TENANTS BECOME OWNERS IN FIRST SALE OF FEDERAL PUBLIC HOUSING

<P>
The first sale of a federally subsidized public housing complex to its 
residents was completed on Friday -- for $1. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the Kenilworth-Parkside public housing development in the 
city's northeast quadrant capped a five-year process in which the residents 
successfully managed the complex and qualified to purchase the property under a 
program promoted by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents have worked so hard over the past five years to make this 
possible. This can open the door for residents of other public housing 
complexes across the country who'd like to have a definite say about their 
living conditions," said Kimi Gray, head of the Kenilworth-Parkside Resident 
Management Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer of 132 housing units to the management corporation was the first 
phase of the program, with the remaining 332 units to be transferred as 
renovations are completed. 
</P>
<P>
A study by an independent accounting firm indicated that the program would save 
the government $6 million over 10 years and $26 million over 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was made possible in part by amendments to the 1987 Housing Act, which 
gave resident councils the right to manage their own developments. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by then-Rep. Kemp and Walter E. Fauntroy, the non-voting 
Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia, also created procedures 
allowing residents to buy their developments after three years of satisfactory 
self-management. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said the Kenilworth-Parkside sale helped advance the Bush Administration's 
goal of achieving a million new first-time and low-income homeowners by 1992.

The House passed a $44-billion, three-year spending authorization bill for NASA 
that includes President Bush's proposal to place a settlement on the moon and 
to begin work on a manned expedition to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The bill includes no money for the moon and Mars programs in the next fiscal 
year but would spend $444 million on them in fiscal 1992 and $649 million in 
fiscal 1993. The bill, approved on a voice vote after a brief debate, now goes 
to a conference committee to work out differences with the Senate. The House 
passed a similar authorization last year, but the Senate never took action.

Defendants who are found insane can be required to pay for housing and 
treatment in a mental hospital, says a state appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling released Friday, the 1st District Court of Appeal upheld a law 
requiring a defendant who is acquitted by reason of insanity, and confined in a 
mental hospital, to pay for maintenance and care. 
</P>
<P>
The law does not require patients to pay costs of public protection that should 
be borne by society, and does not discriminate illegally against the insane, 
the court said in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The decision saves the state at least $3.9 million a year, money paid by more 
than 1,900 insane patients or their health plans, said Deputy Atty. Gen. John 
Porter. The case stemmed from an appeal by a Marin County woman who was found 
insane after killing her two sons in 1975, and was charged for her hospital 
care from her sons' estates, which she was later ruled eligible to inherit.

SACRAMENTO FILE: LAW PAVES WAY FOR SURCHARGES TO FINANCE REMOVAL OF GRAFFITI 
</P>

Voters could authorize cities and counties to impose surcharges on aerosol 
spray paint cans and felt-tip markers to raise money for gang graffiti cleanup 
efforts under a bill signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem of graffiti in our neighborhoods has reached epic proportions," 
said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), the sponsor of AB 3580, "and it is 
the homeowner and the business owner who are bearing the high costs of removal. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill sends a message to the (graffiti) 'taggers' that we aren't going to 
bear the burden of your graffiti anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Katz's legislation would permit local governments to levy up to a 10-cent 
charge on aerosol spray paint cans and a five-cent charge on marker pens to be 
spent solely on graffiti removal if two-thirds of the voters agreed with such a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
Bills Signed 
</P>
<P>
Low-Income Housing: SB 2011 by Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) to require 
cities and counties to approve housing developments that include a minimum of 
20% of units that are affordable to low- and moderate-income families. The law 
sets the stage for proponents to take cities and counties that balk to court. 
</P>
<P>
Health Insurance: AB 1721 by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) to 
prohibit health insurance companies from discriminating against applicants on 
the basis of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Drunk Driving: AB 2040 by Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel) to permanently extend 
a program calling for the installation of ignition-interlock devices designed 
to prevent repeat drunk drivers from starting their automobiles while under the 
influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Check Cashing: AB 3096 by Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland) to require 
check-cashing operations to conspicuously post a schedule of service fees. 
</P>
<P>
Worker Safety: AB 1675 by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) to 
permit dual prosecution for criminal and civil penalties for violations of 
state worker-safety regulations that result in death. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Advertising: AB 3994 by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) to 
set specific standards that manufacturers must prove their products meet before 
they can use such environmental terms as "biodegradable . . . recyclable . . . 
or ozone friendly" in advertising. The governor said he was concerned that the 
bill made no allowance for goods already in the consumer pipeline, but he said 
the author has agreed to introduce corrective legislation next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bills Vetoed 
</P>
<P>
Auto Theft: SB 2544 by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) to require the Highway 
Patrol to set up an auto-theft information reward program and impose an 
assessment on insurers to pay for it. The governor said he wasn't convinced 
that another program would improve efforts in this area. 
</P>
<P>
Statutory Rape: AB 4312 by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) to allow 
women to be prosecuted for statutory rape for sexual intercourse with a boy 
under 18 who is not the spouse of the perpetrator. The governor said he was 
concerned that the bill didn't receive the proper attention it deserved in the 
legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
Jet Skis: AB 2768 by Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) to outlaw the 
operation of jet skis, wet bikes or surf jets by anyone under 16. Deukmejian 
said he was unaware of any studies that showed that persons under 16 were 
involved in a disproportionate number of accidents with such vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Fact 
</P>
<P>
Proposed legislation sent for further study between sessions of the Legislature 
may resurface later, but more often it quietly dies and never becomes law.

UC CALLS FOR INCREASED GUN CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGE DRAMA: BERKELEY AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAY PEOPLE WILL NEVER BE SAFE 
UNTIL THE WEAPONS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One day after a hostage drama left two people dead and nine others injured at a 
popular student hangout, UC Berkeley groped toward normality Friday amid calls 
for increased gun control to prevent similar tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours after police killed Mehrdad Dashti, who used three guns -- including 
an assault-style weapon -- to hold dozens of students hostage, Berkeley Mayor 
Loni Hancock declared: "We will never be safe in any community until we make it 
impossible to get these weapons." 
</P>
<P>
That call was echoed Friday by UC Berkeley Chancellor Chang-lin Tien, who told 
a news conference that tougher restrictions are needed to stem the "the flood 
of guns that are easily available." 
</P>
<P>
California law already prohibits the sale of assault-style weapons, such as the 
Mac-11 semiautomatic pistol Dashti used. In addition, any such weapons acquired 
before the law took effect last January must be registered. 
</P>
<P>
Handgun sales in California require a 15-day waiting period and background 
check, which will be extended to all firearms when a new law takes effect Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
The new gun control law, authored by Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-Sacramento), 
also further restricts the ability of the mentally ill to purchase firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Current law prohibits anyone diagnosed as mentally unfit by a court from buying 
a gun. The new law would extend that prohibition to anyone detained by the 
police for a 72-hour psychiatric examination. 
</P>
<P>
Dashti was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic by Alameda County health 
officials, but it is unclear if he would have been affected by the new 
regulations, said Gene Erbin, an aide to Connelly. The ban would only have 
applied to Dashti if he had been previously detained by police as a mental 
case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Pryor, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Assn., argued that California 
already has the toughest gun control laws in the nation and more stringent 
regulations would not have deterred Dashti from acquiring his weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"These laws don't work," she said. "Yet some people call for more and more 
restrictions without looking at the criminal justice system and the mental 
health system as the cause of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Luis Tolley, Western regional director of Handgun Control Inc., said the 
Berkeley shootings strengthen the case for legislation pending in Congress that 
would impose a nationwide ban on assault weapons and a seven-day waiting period 
for handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
"California is not an island," he said. "Weapons can be purchased in other 
states and smuggled into California. We won't be safe until we have a national 
law." 
</P>
<P>
While both sides debated the merits of increased gun control, many of the 
hostages who narrowly escaped death at Henry's Publick House &amp; Grille tried 
to get on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Darrin Freitag, a senior from Woodland Hills, was trapped in the bar for an 
hour but allowed to leave with some of his wounded friends. Freitag, who is 
dark-haired, attributed his good fortune to the fact that the gunman, who had a 
grudge against blond Americans, thought he looked Italian. 
</P>
<P>
It was with some chagrin that Freitag said that after the hostage ordeal, which 
ended at 7:30 a.m., he went to class Thursday and later reported for work at a 
local pub. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm almost embarrassed I'm taking it so well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The most seriously wounded of the ex-hostages, Karen Grundhofer, a senior from 
Newport Beach, remained hospitalized with seven gunshot wounds. However, none 
of the bullets hit a vital organ and Grundhofer was reported in stable 
condition at Pacific Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Another three inches either way and she would have been dead," said her 
father, John F. Grundhofer. "We just thank the Lord she's alive." 
</P>
<P>
Henry's, located in the Durant Hotel, one block from campus, did not appear as 
badly damaged by the hostage incident as first feared. It is expected to open 
today. The hotel and its dining room were open for business Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The campus appeared outwardly calm with students socializing around Sproul 
Plaza at lunchtime, but there was an undercurrent of fear and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"On the outside, when I interact with people, everything is normal, but on the 
inside I'm depressed. There's been a lot of death around here," said Bryan 
Curley, a 20-year-old junior from Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us have gotten to class yet. This is something that's going to stay 
with us for a long time. And I know it's something I'll never forget," said Kin 
Jung, an English major from Ventura, who said he narrowly escaped being taken 
hostage because he left the pub to use the restroom shortly before Dashti 
seized it. 
</P>
<P>
"The scariest part of the night was when he said he was going to start the 
executions," Jung said. "Then we heard eight staggered gunshots. For all we 
knew he was in there executing people. I was so scared for my friends." 
</P>
<P>
Middle Eastern students and campus officials fear that one lingering legacy of 
the rampage by the Iranian-born Dashti may be increased discrimination against 
Arab or Iranian students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last thing we need. People already don't trust us," said Shaheed 
Amanullah, executive vice president of the student government and a leader in 
Muslim student groups.

BOTTLED WATER OFFER IN VALLEY RAISES IRE IN SOUTH-CENTRAL AREA; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: RESIDENTS WHOSE WATER WAS FOULED THIS SUMMER WONDER WHY THEY 
WEREN'T GIVEN A SIMILAR DEAL. DWP SAYS THE FIRST PROBLEM OCCURRED 'NATURALLY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in its 88-year history, the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power is offering to pay for bottled water for customers this week after an 
error by DWP workers caused faucets in the San Fernando Valley to spew murky, 
smelly water. 
</P>
<P>
The department's unprecedented decision has prompted outrage among 
representatives of South-Central Los Angeles, because DWP officials failed to 
make a similar offer this summer when brown midge fly larvae resembling worms 
came pouring out of faucets there. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is whether the policy is implemented throughout Los Angeles "on an 
equitable basis," and "it would seem there is some degree of partiality," said 
Bob Gay, a spokesman for City Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, who represents much 
of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Farrell attributed the discrepancy to the racial composition 
of the DWP Commission, whose five members are appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley. 
Carol Wheeler, the commission's only black member, resigned in July at the 
request of the mayor, who then appointed Mary Nichols, an attorney for the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
"When I opposed the replacement of the only African-American member of the DWP 
board, it was because I was concerned about someone looking out for the 
residents of South and East Los Angeles," Farrell said in a prepared statement. 
"It would seem my concerns were well-placed." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell and Gay called for the DWP to develop a written policy on reimbursing 
residents whose water supplies are temporarily tainted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are probably more DWP employees living in the Valley than in 
South-Central, and their decision may have been based on that," Gay said. "When 
it's subjective like that, it's always open to accusation. 
</P>
<P>
"There ought to be a more objective response to emergency water-quality 
concerns than to rely purely on human nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But DWP officials said their decision was based on objective criteria, not on 
residents' race or economic class. 
</P>
<P>
They said they offered to pay for bottled water in the San Fernando Valley 
because workers draining a reservoir in Granada Hills earlier this week made a 
mistake that released sand, silt and algae into pipes supplying water to about 
300,000 homes in the central part of the Valley from Reseda to Sherman Oaks. 
The other affected communities are Granada Hills, Van Nuys and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials could not give a precise estimate of how many homes actually are 
receiving murky water. The water, which officials said is unpleasant but safe, 
is expected to return to normal by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials said they did not offer bottled water to residents of 
South-Central Los Angeles this summer when the fly larvae came pouring out of 
faucets because that problem was "naturally occurring," not the result of 
department error. 
</P>
<P>
"You take these scenarios as they come," said Harvey Lutske, chief DWP claims 
agent. "We treat the guy who lives in South-Central just like we treat the guy 
who lives south of Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Yoshimura, an assistant engineer for the DWP, said workers immediately 
closed and vacuumed the Silver Lake Reservoir after South-Central residents 
began complaining about the larvae. That reservoir also serves several hundred 
thousand people. 
</P>
<P>
Lutske estimated that it will cost the department at most $20,000 to reimburse 
Valley residents for the bottled water they use this week. He said the 
department will not pay for "$50 worth of Perrier or five cases of Evian . . . 
or any trendy, sophisticated waters." 
</P>
<P>
To receive a refund, DWP customers are asked to send copies of their receipts 
to the DWP at P.O. Box 111, Los Angeles, 90012; Attention: Claims, Room 1848. 
Residents will not be asked for proof of murky water, officials said.

PROMOTER OF MEMORABILIA SHOW ARRESTED ON TEXAS FRAUD WARRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN and MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The sports memorabilia promoter who has been accused of bilking celebrities and 
businessmen of more than $100,000 at a recent Pasadena show was arrested Friday 
night on an unrelated fugitive warrant for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
A man Pasadena police identified as Paul Hammack who, under the name of Ernest 
E. Dent, staged the controversial "Baseball Legends" card and collectibles 
show, was arrested at his rented Glendale townhouse on a 5-year-old Texas 
charge of defrauding a Laredo man of about $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
The victim "lost both of his arms in a trucking accident and was awarded a 
large settlement from his employer," Pasadena Police Lt. Van Anthony said. Dent 
offered a business proposition to the man, David Lee, then "disappeared with 
$70,000 of Mr. Lee's money," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
Dent was arrested about eight hours after he had met with police in his 
lawyer's Century City office and discussed the recent sports show in which 
stars such as Mickey Mantle and Don Drysdale said they were paid with checks 
that bounced. Until the Friday meeting was arranged, police had not been able 
to find Dent since the Sept. 7-9 event. 
</P>
<P>
Police have been investigating him for grand theft and writing bad checks from 
the show, but Anthony said they did not yet have sufficient evidence to arrest 
him. "That investigation has fizzled," he said. "We need to do a lot more work" 
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, they did not arrest him at Friday morning's meeting, but kept him 
under surveillance until the 7 p.m. arrest. Anthony said officers wanted to see 
if Dent would lead them to any of hundreds of valuable items still missing from 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he just went home, Anthony said, and officers decided to arrest him 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, a 300-pound man with a beard, graying dark hair and glasses, was sitting 
on a sofa and greeted officers with aplomb. "Are you here for me?" he said. "I 
thought you would be coming." 
</P>
<P>
As he was led outside in handcuffs, a reporter asked if his name was really 
Hammack. "I am that I am," he said. "Let me tell you what I really think. I 
don't have to chase ghosts any more, you understand? I don't have to hide any 
more. I am who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Had he defrauded anyone from the show? "Absolutely not. Under no 
circumstances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Had he defrauded anyone in Laredo? "I didn't do anything in Laredo, Texas," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dent will be held without bail pending extradition to Texas, Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
Dent's attorney, Stephen R. Kahn, said Friday evening that he did not know 
Pasadena police were planning to make an arrest. "I have no idea whether the 
charges have any validity. I can't comment until I talk to my client," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kahn said Dent "intends to abide by all his responsibilities and 
commitments" regarding the Pasadena show. 
</P>
<P>
A number of businessmen have said they still want payment for unpaid travel, 
printing and other services. Several collectors claim they are missing valuable 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Other celebrities who said they received checks that bounced, Anthony said, 
were baseball stars Ernie Banks, Steve Garvey, Lou Brock, Eddie Mathews, Ron 
Cey, Bill Russell, Brooks Robinson and Davey Lopes, former Laker Kurt Rambis 
and boxing champion Joe Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony said Dent has used as many as 14 aliases. "He's like an onion," he 
said. "Every time you take a layer off, you get another. You can't get to the 
core." 
</P>
<P>
Before staging the baseball show, Anthony said, Dent was linked to the 
simultaneous operation of at least 12 escort services in the Los Angeles area, 
with names such as Leather and Lace, Night Heat and Athletes in Action. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he was involved in a failed pay-telephone business venture in 
West Virginia, where, state officials said, Dent was among company officials 
responsible for misusing several thousand dollars in government job-training 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1984 Texas incident, Anthony said Dent approached Lee about "business 
ventures" that purportedly involved some Las Vegas property with "investment 
potential." After Lee gave him money, authorities said, the man, known as 
Hammack, disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The man known as Dent also disappeared within two days after the Pasadena show, 
about the time businessmen and sports stars were accusing him of defrauding 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"His check bounced like (a) Wilt Chamberlain basketball," Frazier said this 
week by telephone from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers and collectors said Dent was unknown to them before last spring, when 
he started turning up at various shows and stores, talking about his show. "He 
made everybody think he had a lot of money and would do something in Southern 
California that no one had ever done before," said Stu Kops, co-owner of Bases 
Loaded, a baseball card shop in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The show was one of many in the increasingly popular and lucrative sports 
memorabilia field and was believed to be the largest ever staged in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But as the event neared, many involved noticed Dent's inexperience at such 
shows and disorganization. The night before the show opened, Kops came across 
Dent frantically trying to make 40,000 tickets for autograph signings -- by 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier said he waited three hours at Los Angeles International Airport for a 
limousine Dent had promised but which never came, and Mantle waited 
two-and-a-half hours in Newport Beach for a limousine to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Chesson, a Norco collector hired to work at the autograph tables, said 
she arrived the first morning to find "total bedlam . . . there were tables but 
no pens to sign anything." 
</P>
<P>
Still unresolved are the whereabouts of items mailed by about 350 private 
citizens to be autographed by stars and returned. Kahn said one of Dent's 
associates was last seen in possession of them. But the associate said that, 
while he has some, Dent has the rest.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 CHARGED IN MURDER OF MAN WAITING FOR BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were charged Friday with murder and attempted robbery in the July 17 
death of Raymond Shield, 61. 
</P>
<P>
Shield was shot at 5:15 a.m. in front of his wife, daughter and two 
grandchildren while waiting at the West Covina Holiday Inn for an airport 
shuttle bus. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment is set Monday in Citrus Municipal Court in West Covina for Paul S. 
Watkins, 22, of Moreno Valley, and Lucien A. Martin, 19, of Gardena. 
Authorities said the two men have been in custody since they were arrested July 
17 after a crime rampage that began in Riverside and ended in Gardena. But 
police delayed filing murder charges against the two until sufficient evidence 
was gathered.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VANDALISM TRIAL OF 4 OFFICERS POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Municipal Court judge on Friday postponed the "39th and Dalton" 
vandalism trial of four police officers for two weeks, at least until a new 
lawyer on the defense team can familiarize himself with the case. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement until Oct. 11 came one day after Judge Larry Paul Fidler 
removed James Wilson as the attorney for Capt. Thomas D. Elfmont. 
</P>
<P>
Fidler said the attorney-client relationship between the two had broken down to 
the point that Elfmont would not "communicate" with his own lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ruled that the involvement of Wilson's firm in another court 
case represented a conflict of interest. Elfmont was allowed to find someone 
else to represent him in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles police captain, along with Sgt. Charles (Ted) Spicer, Officer 
Charles Wilson and Officer Ted Parrick, are charged with vandalism and 
conspiracy to commit vandalism as the result of an Aug. 1, 1988, police raid on 
four apartments in South Los Angeles.

FORMER PROSECUTOR'S JAIL TERM IN SEX CASE CALLED TOO LENIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ex-deputy city attorney was handed a one-year jail term Friday for 
soliciting sexual favors from a teen-age defendant in exchange for a lighter 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors criticized the sentence as "too lenient," but Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin cited George Schwartz's lack of a criminal record 
and the damage already inflicted on the former city attorney's professional 
reputation as reasons for deciding against the recommended four-year maximum 
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, 44, of West Hills, was also ordered to pay a $500 fine and was placed 
on five years' probation for his June 4 conviction on one count of felony 
bribery. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz served 10 years with the city attorney's office in Van Nuys before he 
was fired in August, 1988, because of the allegations. As he sat in court 
Friday alongside his 13-year-old son, Darren, Schwartz denied the charge and 
said his attorney had that morning filed an appeal on the conviction. Schwartz 
remained free on $20,000 bail pending a ruling on the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors played an audiotape recorded secretly by Laura 
Kazemi, who was 18 when Schwartz prosecuted a misdemeanor check-forgery case 
against her in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
On the 75-minute recording, Schwartz is heard telling Kazemi that if she 
acceded to his sexual requests, he could help her gain a more lenient sentence 
on charges she had already pleaded guilty to. Her case was later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"The tapes were quite descriptive," said the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Herb Lapin. 
</P>
<P>
Harland Braun, Schwartz's attorney, said his client "didn't intend to go 
through with the proposal," but was conducting his own investigation to get 
evidence to prove Kazemi was trying to bribe him.

JUDAISM OPENS ITS DOORS TO GENTILES; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: GROWING NUMBERS OF INTERFAITH COUPLES ARE BEING WELCOMED. STUDY SHOWS 
AN EASING OF STRICT MARRIAGE TRADITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kathleen Shanfield of Fullerton was looking forward to Yom Kippur services with 
her husband at a Reform congregation Friday night. And John Brekke of Altadena 
expected to accompany his wife to evening services at Pasadena Jewish Temple, a 
Conservative synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Shanfield nor Brekke is Jewish, nor did they convert. But both say that 
they feel comfortable in their mates' synagogues even on the most solemn of 
Jewish holidays, the Day of Atonement, which started at sundown Friday and ends 
at sundown today. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel odd at all," said Shanfield, who was raised Catholic. The prayers 
are "beautiful in many ways," she said. Brekke said he sometimes feels excluded 
from cultural and ritual aspects of Jewish life, but "the passion of the faith 
and the extraordinary Jewish history is something I relate to." 
</P>
<P>
The two couples are part of an increasingly evident phenomenon in American 
Jewish life. Not only are marriages proliferating in which only one partner was 
born Jewish, but growing numbers of the interfaith couples are being welcomed 
into Jewish religious life. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey of Jewish leaders on interfaith marriages released this 
month confirmed that most Jewish parents would rather see their children marry 
Gentiles than remain single even though most rabbis try to discourage the trend 
by refusing to perform the weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The study conducted by sociologist Egon Mayer of the Center for Jewish Studies 
at City University of New York estimated that at least 40% of Jews marry 
outside their faith -- a figure that is consistent with other findings. The 
study was based on 2,179 responses to 9,000 mailed questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in one surprise, more than 80% of those who responded to the survey said 
that Gentiles who are married to Jews would be welcome at synagogues and Jewish 
community organizations. The study found that even Orthodox leaders would reach 
out to interfaith couples -- in hopes of the non-Jewish partner converting and 
the children being raised Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
"The big news is that groups which once ostracized intermarried couples now 
realize you can't do that," said Rabbi Gilbert Kollin of Pasadena Jewish 
Temple. Kollin is national chairman of the Outreach and Conversion Committee 
for Conservative Judaism's Rabbinical Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Jews used to think that if a Jewish young person married a non-Jew, he or 
she was making a 'statement' against Jewish tradition," Kollin said. "However, 
people realize now that it is just the American way of viewing marriage -- 
first and foremost an individual decision to seek happiness." 
</P>
<P>
The recent study of Jewish interfaith marriage found that 40% of Reform rabbis 
said they would perform such weddings, but only 5% of Conservative rabbis and 
none of the Orthodox rabbis surveyed said they would. 
</P>
<P>
A Reform rabbi who does not marry interfaith couples -- Rabbi Larry Goldmark of 
Temple Beth Ohr in La Mirada -- nevertheless accepts interfaith couples as 
members. "A substantial number of our members are in mixed marriages and 
usually have decided to bring up their children as Jewish," Goldmark said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen and Dr. Stewart Shanfield, who attend Temple Beth Ohr, were married 
about eight years ago by a judge. They joined Goldmark's congregation two years 
ago when they decided the oldest of their three children should start religious 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Shanfield, an orthopedic surgeon in Fullerton, said he and his wife 
agreed that their children would be raised Jewish. His mother, he said, was the 
only survivor in her family from the Nazi Holocaust and he was raised as a 
religious Jew. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Goldmark assured the physician that his children would be regarded as 
Jewish in his congregation. Jewish law says that children must have a Jewish 
mother to be considered Jewish, but the Reform movement adopted a position 
several years ago that children brought up in the faith, signified through 
public rituals such as bar mitzvahs, would be considered Jewish even if only 
the father was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
As he has grown older, Shanfield said, he realizes that what many rabbis have 
feared about the interfaith marriage trend is true -- that the potential is 
great for cultural assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seeing that with some friends the easiest thing to do is to do nothing or 
practice more of the Christian holidays," he said. "It takes some work and 
dedication" to maintain Jewish identity, he added.

GANGS FAIL TO SIDELINE GAME 2ND TIME AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The pageantry of prep football returned to Nogales High School in La Puente 
Friday night, in a sea of miniskirted cheerleaders, green-and-white pompons, 
and a feather-capped marching band that played "New York, New York." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time however, the occasional ugliness of the outside world made for 
another kind of presence: Beefed-up school security officers at all entrances, 
sheriff's deputies cruising side streets, and undercover guards combing the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was little sign of the jitters over gang violence that had forced 
school officials to take the unprecedented step of canceling last Friday's 
varsity football game. 
</P>
<P>
"Alive and well," grinned Principal Ron Tyler, standing at the sidelines in a 
green satin Nogales jacket as his team was trouncing the Baldwin Park Braves. 
"It's just another Friday night game." 
</P>
<P>
A satin-gowned color guard circled the field twirling silver flags to the roll 
of a snare drum, chants for a touchdown were barked through white megaphones, 
banners urging "defense, hold tight!" were stuck to the chain-link fence, and 
the first dance of the fall was scheduled in the school gym after the game. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, on the slightly cool autumn night illuminated by a half-moon. the 
closest thing to danger for the Nogales Nobles was a stray punt that nearly hit 
a cheerleader. "People are a little nervous," said Ilke deLeon, a 17-year-old 
senior. "But we're not going to let the situation with gangs stop us from 
having fun." 
</P>
<P>
At least four West Covina police and sheriff's squad cars were assigned to the 
area, and the number of Rowland Unified School District police armed with 
flashlights and billy clubs was upped from a regular crew of 6 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
"They're making a big deal out of nothing," said George Hunn, head of district 
security. "I think we're four men over staffed." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to cancel last Friday's game was made several hours before 
kick-off, after a spate of gang-related shootings earlier that week, including 
the slaying of a 16-year-old former Nogales student and a flurry of shots fired 
at the Nogales marching band during a practice session Sept. 18 on the football 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an obvious precaution but there's no paranoia here," said Dawn 
Schlatter, 17, a senior and a band instructor 17. "I doubt the band was 
targeted. We don't play that bad." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, however, were most concerned about an anonymous tip they 
received indicating "there was going to be a shooting taking place at the 
football game," said Capt. Mike Nagaoka, head of the sheriff's substation in 
nearby Industry. "I think we had a responsibility to make the school aware." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Robison, superintendent of the 19,000-student school district, said she 
was reluctant to give into criminal threats, but decided it was better to be 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, area high school games have been disrupted by fights or shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 20 rounds of gunfire ignited panic at Jack Robinson Stadium in 
Los Angeles during a high school game. No one was injured. Three years earlier, 
two people were wounded and at least six others injured in a stampede set off 
by gunfire at a Monrovia High School game.

POLICE WILL BEEF UP RAIDER GAME FORCE; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: OFFICERS WILL MONITOR ALCOHOL SALES AND SCREEN FANS ENTERING COLISEUM 
FOR DRUNKENNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As part of a crackdown on violence at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los 
Angeles police will monitor alcohol sales and will screen fans entering the 
stadium to keep out drunks, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a significant increase in the number of officers deployed at 
the Coliseum for this Sunday's Raiders' football game, said Deputy Police Chief 
William Rathburn. 
</P>
<P>
Rathburn said the additional police will be deployed both inside the stadium 
and outside, where they will be especially vigilant during tailgate parties. 
Many problems in the stadium arise from fans who have already been drinking 
during the pregame parking lot festivities, said Rathburn. 
</P>
<P>
Officers will move quickly to arrest fans causing disturbances during the game, 
he said. In the past, they have simply been ejected from the stadium. Last 
Sunday, 50 disorderly people were shown the gate. 
</P>
<P>
The police action comes after a Pittsburgh Steelers' fan from Tucson was 
severely beaten during last Sunday's football game. Paul Albrecht, 35, was 
reported in serious condition Friday at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important for every fan to realize that when they buy a ticket to a 
sporting event in Los Angeles, they are not getting a license to violate the 
law," Rathburn said. "If someone is involved in a fight, they will go to jail 
for fighting. If they throw beer around, they will go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
Police will establish a mobile booking unit and jail facility in vans outside 
the stadium, Rathburn said. The units are commonly used during anti-gang sweeps 
and at drunk-driving checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
A host of city and county officials, including City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, City Atty. James K. Hahn and all five members of the 
county Board of Supervisors have condemned the beating and called for increased 
security at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky has gone a step further, however, calling for a ban on all beer 
sales at the games. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said Friday the stepped-up measures proposed by police were 
inadequate. Instead, Yaroslavsky suggested a one-day pilot program barring beer 
sales during the Oct. 14 Raiders' game. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that unless there is a ban on liquor at the Coliseum, the 
volatile situation, the unsavory crowd and the unsafe situation will persist," 
the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference with Rathburn and Hahn, Matthew Grossman, president of 
the Coliseum Commission, said he would not rule out a ban on alcohol sales. 
</P>
<P>
Rathburn said he hopes an increased police presence will be enough. "Hopefully, 
a Raider fan will see an officer everywhere he looks," Rathburn said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, LAPD officers and agents of the state Alcoholic Beverage Control 
Department will monitor concession stands to ensure liquor is not sold to 
already intoxicated people, Rathburn said.

VICTIM OF BERKELEY SIEGE IN GOOD SPIRITS; 
</P>
<P>
RECUPERATION: SHOT SEVEN TIMES BY A DERANGED GUNMAN, KAREN GRUNDHOFER OF 
NEWPORT BEACH IS IN STABLE CONDITION. 'IT'S A MIRACLE,' HER FATHER SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
It was "the one call you never want to get as a father," John F. Grundhofer 
recalled Friday. "Three-thirty in the morning: 'Your daughter's been shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, Karen Grundhofer of Newport Beach survived seven bullet wounds 
when a deranged gunman opened fire in a Berkeley hotel bar early Thursday 
morning. The 22-year-old UC Berkeley senior was in stable condition and good 
spirits Friday at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco, 
recuperating from wounds that ranged from her hip to her chest. The bullets 
went through muscle and missed vital organs, said her father, a bank executive 
who flew from Minneapolis to the Bay Area to be with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven bullets in her, but it's a miracle," Grundhofer said in an interview. 
"Three inches either way, and she would have been dead. And that's not much 
when you're pointing a gun from 40 feet away. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at her wounds, you say 'How can she be alive?' " 
</P>
<P>
One hostage was killed and six others, including Karen Grundhofer, were injured 
during the seven-hour siege at Henry's Publick House &amp; Grille. The gunman, 
Mehrdad Dashti, fired shots from three handguns, terrorized the hostages and 
singled out blonde women for sexual abuse before police shot and killed him. 
</P>
<P>
John Grundhofer said his daughter told him that she had been having drinks at 
the bar -- a longtime establishment popular with UC Berkeley students -- when 
the siege began. 
</P>
<P>
She was lying on the floor, as ordered by the gunman, when the bullets hit, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the first or second person hit," Grundhofer said. "The other one was 
the young man who died." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Karen was hit, another young woman "rescued her and pulled her out 
of the room," Grundhofer said. The two women hid behind a couch outside the 
room where the hostages were held in the bar, located inside the Durant Hotel, 
and Karen's rescuer applied pressure to the bullet wounds to slow the bleeding 
until paramedics arrived, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
"Karen was calm and alert the whole time, never unconscious," he said. "The 
people at Highland (General Hospital in Oakland, where she was initially taken) 
stated she was incredibly brave." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Grundhofer was later transferred to Pacific Presbyterian, where she will 
remain for a few days. "She's in no danger and receiving good care, but we're 
not going to take any chances," her father said, adding that doctors want to 
observe her for signs of infection. She also may need plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the bullets damaged no internal organs because Karen was lying on 
her side and the bullets passed solely through skin and muscle tissue, John 
Grundhofer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to explain, but whatever the angle, however it worked, she was 
incredibly lucky. The good Lord was watching over her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her good spirits, Karen Grundhofer is not up to interviews with the 
press, her father said. He was flying back Friday afternoon to Minneapolis, 
where he is chairman of First Bank System. Karen's mother, Lynda, and sister, 
Kathryn, who live in Newport Beach, were staying with her, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Grundhofer was Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s top banker in Southern California 
until earlier this year, when he departed to head up the struggling First Bank 
System. He has been chairman of the Southern California United States Olympic 
Committee and a board member of South Coast Repertory and the Los Angeles Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Grundhofer, who was a debutante at the 1986 Children's Home Society Ball, 
graduated from Newport Harbor High School that same year. Her father said she 
currently is a fifth-year senior, majoring in sociology, and a member of Pi 
Beta Phi at UC Berkeley. She works part time at the Durant Hotel, spent a 
summer employed by the Four Seasons hotel in Washington and hopes to go into 
hotel management, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Her hospital room is full of flowers from well-wishers, he reported, noting 
that "the spirit of the school is terrific. There's concern from across the 
country." John Grundhofer added that several of his daughter's friends were 
among the hostages forced to remain with the gunman for the duration of the 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, she's lucky: She didn't have to sit there for seven hours," he 
said. "She's got seven bullet holes, but young kids heal fast, and she's in a 
great frame of mind. . . . She's so lucky to be alive. It's incredible."

and Conflict Studies program, the third-largest private donation in the 
school's history. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-year-old donor, who attends public lectures offered by the peace and 
conflict program, requested anonymity, Terry Jones, vice chancellor for 
university advancement, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The gift, which will arrive in monthly payments for the next 30 years, is from 
land the man sold, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"The checks are already arriving," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most anonymous gifts are made because donors are afraid of being inundated with 
further requests for money, Jones said. But in this case, the donor just 
doesn't want a fuss made over the gift, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he's just not interested in having his name released," Jones said. 
"He's a pure philanthropist." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds will support education, public service and research for the 6-year-old 
peace and conflict program, which is designed to introduce students to the 
nature of international conflict. About 60 students take courses offered by the 
interdisciplinary program. 
</P>
<P>
The donor specified that the money be spent on the program, "but he has given 
quite a bit of latitude to the faculty who run the program," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the university can accept the gift, it will require approval by the UC 
Board of Regents, the governing body for the nine-campus system. It is expected 
to grant routine approval at its November meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The gift comes at a good time for UCI because an uncertain economic future 
could reduce private donations to the campus. Gifts make up 5% of the 
university's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We're watching the economic situation carefully because a lot of our business 
leaders are saying, 'We're not sure what's happening out there,' " Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
But with this $2.83 million and an additional $1.5 million received this year 
in smaller gifts, the university's fund-raising program is off to a good year, 
he said. Total gifts to the university dropped in last fiscal year ending in 
June -- from $32.8 million in 1988-89 to $27.4 million in 1989-90. However, the 
1988-89 gifts include an $8.5-million trust donated to the medical school, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Edra E. Brophy of Palm Desert donated the personal trust to the campus for 
medical research and teaching programs, the largest gift ever to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"That was such an anomaly, it was almost impossible to duplicate," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, total gifts -- money immediately available to the university 
-- have continued to increase each year, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The university received $25 million in cash and equipment 1989-90, up from $20 
million in 1988-89 and $17 million in 1987-88, he said.

MARINE COMMANDER RETIRES WITH 1 REGRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Against a colorful backdrop of fluttering flags and rigid rows of troops in 
camouflage fatigues, Brig. Gen. David V. Shuter turned over command of El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station to Brig. Gen. Wayne T. Adams on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Shuter, 53, retiring after 31 years -- which included flying combat missions in 
Vietnam and piloting a presidential helicopter -- also relinquished command of 
the Marine Corps Air Bases Western Area to Adams in ceremonies on the El Toro 
Tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
The western area command oversees Marine operations in El Toro, Camp Pendleton, 
Tustin and Yuma, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that I hold most important in this command is our legacy," 
Shuter told about 200 spectators. "I'm giving up a wonderful command, and it is 
significant that it ends here. Every air station is unique. In the Mideast 
crisis, the toughness and skill of these teams has come to the fore." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, El Toro has been a center of activity in the deployment 
of troops, helicopters and other cargo to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremonies, which were punctuated with cannon fire to mark Shuter's 
retirement and the installment of Adams, the outgoing general said his only 
regret was that he did not go to Saudi Arabia in Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered to stay on," Shuter said. "I told 'em I was ready. That's what 
we train for. I would have liked to have been involved in that, but it was time 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
Shuter will live in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Adams -- 50 and former director of the Marine Corps Facilities and Services 
Division, Installations and Logistics Department in Washington -- said one of 
his challenges will be to maintain good relations with community leaders and 
local governments. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was promoted to brigadier general in April, 1989. He is a native of 
southern Florida and received a bachelor's degree in political science and 
economics from the University of Alabama. He has also accumulated more than 
3,600 hours as a pilot of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters and had two tours 
of duty in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Robert Milligan, commanding general of Fleet Marine Force Pacific, 
told the crowd that he had just returned from Saudi Arabia. He praised what he 
described as a spirited group of soldiers "poised to execute whatever order is 
given." 
</P>
<P>
Milligan said he toured the Persian Gulf staging area with Marine Corps 
Commandant Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr., who was the subject of news reports when he 
dealt with the question of declining troop morale. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremonies, Shuter said he asked Milligan to comment on troop morale 
in light of Gray's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tremendous . . . the attitude, morale, spirit, desire and dedication of 
these young Marines and sailors," Milligan said. KEVIN JOHNSON

DISTRICT CONSIDERS SALE OF SCHOOL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with financial difficulties, the Los Alamitos Unified School District is 
considering the sale of a closed school in Rossmoor. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the district wanted to arrange a long-term lease of the site of the 
school, which was closed in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
However, because there were no qualified bidders, the district is now thinking 
of selling the property, Supt. Michael Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
A district committee has estimated the site would sell for $5.8 million to $7.2 
million. Most likely, houses would be built on the property, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is to use the revenue from that to maintain the current educational 
program and recover some of the budget reductions that we've had to make in the 
last four years," Miller said. Since 1986, the district has trimmed more than 
$2 million from its budget as a result of state budget cuts, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're spending more than we're taking in, and we've been doing that annually," 
said Virginia Wilson, president of the district Board of Trustees . 
</P>
<P>
The district has not set a deadline for selling the property, but the board 
will be discussing the issue at its next few meetings, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Community members are concerned about the idea of selling the site, however, 
and have passed out surveys and fliers about the proposal. They say they want 
the district to consider other options. 
</P>
<P>
"We supported Measure K last spring hoping that some other solution would be 
found to get some funding and now it's like they're in a 'must sell' mode," 
said Dwayne Mahlan, past president of the Rossmoor Homeowners Assn. SHANNON

SENTENCING DELAYED IN BABY-SLAYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sentencing for Steven Delgado, the Santa Ana man convicted of second-degree 
murder in the death of his girlfriend's infant daughter, was postponed Friday 
after the judge rejected arguments that Delgado should receive a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
The key element in the defense plea for a retrial centered on recent 
confessions by Elizabeth Ruiz, the mother of 11-month-old Amanda Ortiz who was 
beaten to death a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Frederick L. McBride argued that Ruiz's confessions that she 
killed her baby -- statements made after Delgado was convicted -- warranted a 
new trial. 
</P>
<P>
McBride presented affidavits from Ruiz, one of her friends and from her 
therapist attesting to her account of the crime. Ruiz said in a statement that 
she knocked her daughter's head against a door, threw her into the air, dropped 
her on the ground and beat her with her fists the night the child died. 
</P>
<P>
But Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon countered that Ruiz's confession was not new 
evidence, that the jury had known during the trial that the woman was a 
possible suspect and that Delgado had implicated himself throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Ragner Engebretsen concurred, and said he 
felt confident that the jury made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado's sentencing was rescheduled for Oct. 26. He faces 15 years to life in 
prison. LAURA MICHAELIS

SURROGATE SAYS SHE'LL EXPAND CUSTODY SUIT 
</P>

Surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson, who is fighting for shared custody of the 
child she bore for an infertile couple, says she will expand her unique lawsuit 
to contend that her 3-year-old daughter is the newborn boy's sister and thus 
has a right to spend time with him. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit Johnson filed Aug. 13 is a landmark in its own right because she is 
the first surrogate mother to seek custody of a child to whom she is not 
related genetically. But the expanded version she plans to file on Tuesday 
ventures into new legal territory: siblings' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Gilbert, Johnson's lawyer, said he has revised the original lawsuit 
to add a new claim on behalf of Johnson's daughter, Erica. The suit asks a 
Superior Court judge to award Johnson custody of -- or at least access to -- 
the baby boy she bore on Sept. 19 on the grounds that Erica "deserves access to 
her brother," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
"Erica cries for her brother," Gilbert said. "She has a right to be part of her 
brother's life." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Walmsley, an attorney for Mark and Crispina Calvert, who hired Johnson 
to carry their embryo, said that there are no established "siblings' rights" in 
the law. He dubbed Gilbert's argument "creative" but said he doubts it will 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a smokescreen, something he's doing to create sympathy for his 
client, rather than to focus on the real legal issues," Walmsley said. "The 
real issue is whether Anna Johnson has any parental rights. I think it's 
appalling for him to yank her child (Erica) into this." 
</P>
<P>
Blood tests have established beyond a 99% certainty that the Calverts are the 
baby's genetic parents and have ruled out Johnson as biologically related to 
the child. DNA tests are expected to confirm those results. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert's new theory extends his argument that Johnson has parental rights over 
the child. He contends that she is the child's mother because she carried and 
delivered him. Gilbert said he uses the same reasoning to conclude that 
Johnson's first child, Erica, and the new baby boy, whom they call Matthew, are 
related. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts argue that they are the only legal parents of the child because 
they donated the genetic material that formed him. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, whom the Calverts call Christopher Michael, is living temporarily 
with the Calverts. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Oct. 9, Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. is expected to 
decide whether the infant has two parents -- the Calverts -- or three, 
including Johnson as a mother. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

CITY TO CONTINUE MEETING NOTICES

<P>
Although the city is no longer required by state law to provide residents with 
advance notice of all public meetings, the City Council passed a resolution 
guaranteeing that residents will continue to receive notices at least three 
days before all council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
State legislators ruled earlier this year that because of cuts in the 1990-91 
state budget, cities were no longer obligated to post agendas 72 hours before 
meetings as required by the Brown Act requiring open meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution states that the city will continue "its existing practices 
concerning notices and information concerning public hearings and meetings 
without regard to the modifications recently enacted by the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Assistant City Atty. Luis Rodriguez, cities such as 
Huntington Beach, Tustin and Los Angeles have also passed resolutions 
reaffirming their obligations under the Brown Act. MARY HELEN BERG

CHARGES DISMISSED IN APARTMENT ARSON

<TEXT>
<P>
A Municipal judge dismissed attempted murder and arson charges against a 
Fullerton man this week after ruling that there was insufficient evidence to 
try Vinay Gandhi in connection with the case, in which his wife was bound and 
gagged and their apartment set afire last July. 
</P>
<P>
After five days of testimony in a preliminary hearing that included an account 
from the wife, Municipal Judge Anthony Rauckaukus dropped the charges against 
Gandhi, 23. 
</P>
<P>
"This case should have never gone forward," said Gandhi's attorney, Marshal 
Schulman. "This is the worst investigation I have ever seen in my life. My 
client's life is (a) shambles, and the court cost has broken his family." 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi's wife, Hemangini Ladva, 21, testified that Gandhi bound and gagged her 
and left her to die in a fire in their apartment on July 23 but that she 
managed to knock the phone off the hook and dial 911. 
</P>
<P>
Co-workers of Gandhi testified that he was at work in Lynwood 20 minutes after 
the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
Schulman argued that Gandhi could not have driven from Fullerton to Lynwood in 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
Schulman also argued that Ladva had a history of instability, which allegedly 
included three suicide attempts and that she therefore may have staged the 
crime herself. ERIK HAMILTON

COUNTY NOMINEE FOR U.S. BENCH GETS CONFIRMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an action hailed by local legal and political leaders, the U.S. Senate on 
Friday confirmed Orange County Superior Court Judge Gary L. Taylor's nomination 
to the federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
The confirmation, anticipated for months by legal observers, concluded a strong 
campaign to see that a local jurist received the judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
"He embodies all the qualities you want in a judge," said Thomas R. Malcolm, 
president-elect of the Orange County Bar Assn. "Intellectually, he is supreme, 
plus he has a very pleasing personality and demeanor and is a very hard 
worker." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 50, of Villa Park, emerged as a leader among a group of candidates for 
the coveted post of U.S. district judge more than a year ago when local bar 
associations and politicians brought his name to Sen. Pete Wilson, who later 
recommended that President Bush nominate him for the lifetime position. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the most popular choices in Orange County. All the judges and 
lawyers are very happy (with the confirmation) and have backed him," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's support was partially fueled by sentiment among the legal community 
that Orange County has unfairly languished in Los Angeles' shadow and has been 
slighted when judicial appointments have been passed out. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Slater, executive officer of Orange County Superior Court, said Taylor's 
confirmation "has been a long time coming." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss him. He's an outstanding judge and it's been a pleasure 
working with him," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor will replace U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, a Los Angeles judge 
who agreed to commute to Santa Ana until a replacement was chosen. Taylor is 
expected to assume the position in mid-October, when Letts returns to the 
federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A third-generation Orange County resident, Taylor spent 20 years in private 
practice in Newport Beach, specializing in business litigation, before he was 
appointed to the Superior Court by Gov. George Deukmejian in June, 1986. Much 
of his time off the bench is dedicated to lecturing and writing about business 
law. He publishes a monthly business litigation newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Santa Ana High School and UCLA School of Law, Taylor has 
described himself as an enthusiastic traveler, swimmer, biker and gardener. 
</P>
<P>
Other nominations confirmed Friday for U.S. District Court openings in 
California were: David Levi of Sacramento in the Eastern District in 
Sacramento; William Shubb of Sacramento, also in the Eastern District; and 
James Ware of Santa Clara in the Northern District.

CAMPAIGN: THE FEDERAL DRUG CZAR CRITICIZES THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN A NEWPORT 
BEACH VISIT THAT UNDERSCORES THE ASSEMBLY RACE'S IMPORTANCE TO GOP.

Assemblyman Curt Pringle's Garden Grove district is one of the tougher 
battlefields in the nation's war on drugs. Part of the reason, White House drug 
policy adviser William Bennett said Friday, is that the California Legislature 
has been soft on crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon fund-raiser for Pringle's reelection campaign, Bennett said he 
and the freshman assemblyman share an opponent in California -- Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
"This country is changing its drug laws, and if California doesn't, it's going 
to pick up more business," Bennett said. "The people who are selling drugs know 
where the laws are tough." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's campaign theme has been about the damage to anti-crime efforts by the 
state's "liberal Democratic leadership." Friday's visit by Bennett, the 
director of the president's Office of Drug Control Policy, was a chance to 
underscore the point. 
</P>
<P>
It also demonstrated how important the 72nd Assembly District race is to state 
Republican leaders. Democrats consider it one of their best chances this year 
to gain another seat in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats also recognize that crime and drugs are the most important issues to 
the area's voters. As a result, their candidate is a former federal prosecutor 
supporting many of the same tough crime laws as Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Tom Umberg has even attacked some of the same Sacramento Democrats as 
Pringle in his appeal to the conservative voters in the district, which 
includes Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Anaheim and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a single prosecutor, judge, police officer or other individual from the 
law enforcement community serves on the Legislature's Public Safety Committee," 
Umberg said recently. "Is it any wonder that the laws enacted by the 
Legislature are filled with loopholes to (impede) law enforcement and 
prosecutors?" 
</P>
<P>
He sounded a lot like Pringle at the luncheon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The only place in California where the death penalty is sure and swift is in 
killing bills in the Public Safety Committee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle has attempted in speeches and mailers to link Umberg with Speaker 
Brown. On Friday, he said, "Willie Brown is looking to replace me with his 
handpicked candidate. . . . When it comes time to pass tougher laws against 
drug traffickers, whose side will Tom Umberg be on, Willie Brown's or our 
community's?" 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to insulate himself from the charge, Umberg mailed voters a pledge 
this week, saying he will "take my guidance" from voters and not legislative 
leaders such as Brown. 
</P>
<P>
A key part of this close race is also going to be money. Neither side has 
disclosed its resources since June and the next reporting date is not until 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett spoke to an audience of about 100 on the patio of motor home magnate 
John Crean's posh estate overlooking Newport Beach's Back Bay area. The event 
was outside of Pringle's district because aides said Bennett needed to be near 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon cost $250 per person, but it was unclear how much Pringle's 
campaign collected because not everybody in the audience paid.

YOUTH ARRESTED IN STABBING DEATH

<P>
A 17-year-old suspected gang member was arrested Friday on suspicion of 
stabbing to death another 17-year-old who was helping his mother expel unwanted 
guests from a party. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the suspect, whose name was not released because of his age, 
stabbed Edward Navarrette on Sept. 22 in retaliation for a gang-related 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Navarrette did not belong to a gang but did associate with 
known gang members, who apparently were the targets of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of his death, Navarrette had been trying to help his mother eject 
a group of people who had crashed his party at the Navarrette house on the 3900 
block of San Mateo Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"A large fight broke out between invited guests and the intruders after 
belligerent remarks were made to (Navarrette's) mother," Los Alamitos Police 
Cmdr. Gary Biggerstaff said in a prepared statement.

BRAZILIAN ARMS INDUSTRY SEES UPSWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAO PAULO, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times have been hard for the Brazilian arms industry, the largest in the Third 
World, but industry sources say the Persian Gulf crisis may whet the 
international appetite for weapons once again. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi offensive helped illustrate just how vulnerable the Saudis are to a 
similar invasion, and this should help our sales in the medium and long term," 
said a source at the Engesa tank factory in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Engesa and Avibras, Brazil's two largest arms manufacturers, 
requested protection from creditors for debts of about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Both traced their financial problems to money owed by Iraq, their biggest 
customer for years during its war with Iran. Arms sales are secret, but a 
much-reported figure put Iraq's purchases at $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for weapons in the 8-year war, when Brazil's arms industry sold to 
both sides, helped make it the Third World leader. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources said Iraq, which occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2, still owes 
Engesa $80 million to $90 million for hundreds of Urutu armored personnel 
carriers, Cascavel reconnaissance and anti-aircraft vehicles and Jararaca troop 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
A source at Avibras, who also spoke anonymously, said Iraq owed $45 million for 
several Astros II computer- and radar-controlled multiple rocket launchers 
delivered more than three years ago. He said the country also canceled orders 
for $100 million worth of Astros II launchers after they were produced. 
</P>
<P>
Other customers in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, the most 
important markets, reduced or suspended arms purchases in the late 1980s, 
making matters worse for Brazilian arms makers. 
</P>
<P>
Because exports provide 90% of its revenue, the arms industry went from high 
profitability to insolvency in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts predict that weapons sales will pick up when the Persian Gulf 
crisis ends, as Middle Eastern countries seek to bolster their military 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
Engesa is negotiating to sell Saudi Arabia the 42-ton Osorio battle tank, 
hoping to obtain a $2.2-billion order for 320 of them. 
</P>
<P>
But Rene Dreifuss, a political scientist and military analyst at the Fluminense 
Federal University in Rio de Janeiro, said the weapons industry should not 
expect a bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has completely changed the weapon requirements of 
the region's countries," he said in a telephone interview. "From now on, they 
will want highly sophisticated armaments Brazil does not and cannot produce." 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers attribute the success of Brazilian weapons in Third World markets 
to their simplicity, durability and low price.

FLUOR HOT LINE OFFERS 24-HOUR BENEFITS UPDATES; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: A COMPUTERIZED-VOICE SYSTEM ANSWERS EMPLOYEES' QUESTIONS ABOUT 
INSURANCE, PENSIONS OR VACATION TIME.

<P>
Here's a new workplace wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Corp. has added a hot line that allows employees to access personal 
benefit information -- things such as vacation time and pension benefits 
accrued -- 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
While providing employees with greater access to data, the program is saving 
the company money too. Fluor says it expects to save $30,000 this year in its 
personnel department, which has been freed from answering a barrage of worker 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, the Irvine-based engineering and construction giant, installed a 
computerized system earlier this year that allows its 14,000 U.S. workers to 
call a toll-free number and obtain personalized information about their 
employee benefits from an automated voice. 
</P>
<P>
"All they need is a touch-tone telephone," said K. Sripathy , Fluor's director 
of human resources. To keep the information confidential, he said, employees 
who call must use the telephone keyboard to punch in their Social Security and 
secret identification numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Then they can ask a variety of questions: how their retirement fund investments 
are doing; how much paid time off they have accumulated; the amount of their 
various account balances; or what kind of coverages are provided by their 
health plans. 
</P>
<P>
The automated system, known as the Benefits Information Line (BIL), never shuts 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Sripathy said that while employees benefit from the convenience, the company is 
saving money by not having to pay personnel clerks to answer routine questions. 
He said while the entire voice system cost $40,000 to install, it should pay 
for itself in less than a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
"We are averaging 80 calls during weekdays and 35 to 40 calls on weekends," 
Sripathy said. 
</P>
<P>
Those employees who need more information, he added, still can talk to a 
personnel officer. Overall, he said he believes the number of personnel queries 
being made is greater than before the automated system was installed. 
</P>
<P>
"Employees in the past were probably bashful of calling and asking the same 
question about their investments every month," Sripathy said. "And in the past 
they would sometimes have to leave a message with a machine. You don't have to 
play telephone tag with BIL." 
</P>
<P>
Fluor is in the vanguard of a national movement toward automating personnel 
benefits information, said to Bob Bhavnani, a principal and vice-president of 
Granada Systems Design in New York, the company that designed the computer 
software used in the BIL system. 
</P>
<P>
The whole area of voice response is an extremely fast growing industry, 
expanding at the rate of 35% to 40% a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While most interest to date has been shown by financial institutions that want 
to provide customers with current information about their savings and checking 
accounts, he said, over the last 18 months the concept also has begun to catch 
on with other companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone with more than 1,000 employees would benefit from the system," he 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
Neil A. Burger, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said that large business 
consulting firm sees "a huge potential market" for automated voice services in 
companies and has established a division in New Jersey to design and install 
customized systems. The division has about 30 clients, including American 
Standard Inc., Pitney Bowes and Nabisco Brands Inc. 
</P>
<P>
A major attraction of voice systems, Burger said, is that they can help 
companies administer increasingly complex and personalized benefits that, for 
example, allow employees to choose among a wide array of medical plans and 
retirement investment options. 
</P>
<P>
Customarily each year, employees fill out forms to switch their enrollment in 
medical plans or change their investment mix, after which a clerk must enter 
the data into computers. But Burger said with the automated voice system, 
employees can make the changes on the computers themselves by punching buttons 
on their phones. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives you a paperless enrollment, and you reduce the possibility of 
error," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, Sripathy said, Fluor employees will be able to use the 
telephone to transfer their retirement money monthly from one investment form 
to another, such as from bonds to company stock. At the end of each month, they 
will get a receipt to confirm the transfer has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
And by fall of next year, Sripathy added, the system will be augmented to allow 
Fluor employees to use the phone to select their life and health insurance 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an unlimited capacity to this thing. Your imagination is the only 
limit," he said.

RENOVATION TO EXPAND MAINPLACE/SANTA ANA NEARS COMPLETION

<P>
The $7-million renovation of the MainPlace/Santa Ana shopping mall is now more 
than half complete, an expansion that will add a new wing with 32,500 square 
feet of leaseable space. 
</P>
<P>
The construction will add 20 new stores by the time it is completed in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a 150,000-square-foot May Co. department store is planned to open 
next spring. The May Co. will be the mall's fourth anchor store, joining 
Nordstrom, Bullocks and Robinson's. The expansion will increase the size of the 
mall, one of the newest in Orange County, to about 200 retail establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between the twin pillars of Orange County consumerism -- South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa to the south and Brea Mall to the north -- MainPlace is 
planning to go upscale as well. It is already the third largest mall in the 
county in terms of sales, the most recent figures available from the State 
Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
Like some competitors, it has also tapped into the tourist trade. The mall 
operates a shuttle bus to Anaheim area hotels. The move has been so popular 
that it has been expanded to include two shuttles, serving a total of 22 
hotels.

LAWSUIT SETTLED OVER POLLUTION CLEANER DEVICE;

<P>
Parker Automotive Corp. said Friday that a patent infringement suit filed 
against it last year by Triangle Special Products Group has been dismissed as a 
result of an agreement by both firms. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleged that one of 
Parker's automotive pollution-cleaning machines infringed on patents held by 
the division of Triangle Corp. of Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
With the dismissal, each party will pay its own legal costs. The costs will not 
have an impact on Parker's 1990 financial performance, said Diane Parker, 
corporate vice president. 
</P>
<P>
She said Triangle and Parker have agreed to work together but declined to 
reveal more about their arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate announcement, Parker said it has signed an exclusive distribution 
agreement with a Saudi Arabian company for sales of its cleaning systems for 
internal combustion engines. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian distribution deal, with Diyar Corp. of Riyadh, was actually 
signed in July but was held up by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the 
subsequent turmoil as troops from the United States and other countries poured 
into Saudi Arabia to help defend it against a possible Iraqi attack. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the agreement Friday, Parker released a statement in which Diyar 
vice president Adnan Amin said that "events in the Mideast have more or less 
stabilized to the point that it is business as usual for Diyar." 
</P>
<P>
Amin was not minimizing the seriousness of the Persian Gulf crisis, Diane 
Parker said: "He was just saying that Diyar has determined that it can continue 
doing business." 
</P>
<P>
The one-year agreement, with a five-year renewal option, calls for the Saudi 
firm to buy at least $1 million yearly in CarbonClean products, Parker 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Diyar distributes engine-related machinery and tools throughout Saudi Arabia 
and other Persian Gulf countries and provides maintenance services to 
government agencies and private companies that operate irrigation and oil field 
equipment, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Amin said he expects the CarbonClean system to be especially 
valuable in Saudi Arabia as a method for servicing gasoline and diesel engines 
in remote desert oil and irrigation stations, without having to open the 
engines and expose them to sand and dust.

year-earlier loss of $13,692. Sales for both fiscal 1990 and 1989 totaled $4.4 
million. Chairman Daniel C. Montano, said the company's expenses were higher in 
fiscal 1990 because it moved its facilities, had a greater marketing effort and

HAMMER MUSEUM SEEKS $13 MILLION FROM JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Westwood art museum being built to honor industrialist Armand Hammer -- 
limited in money it can get from Occidental Petroleum Corp. by a court 
settlement -- is attempting to secure $13 million from an unidentified Japanese 
corporation, according to newly released court documents and museum officials. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, court documents indicate that start-up costs and the 
first-year operating budget for the museum have increased to more than seven 
times the amount Occidental Petroleum projected in 1989, when it obtained 
tax-exempt status for the museum from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
The $60-million museum is officially known as the Armand Hammer Museum of Art 
and Cultural Center. Occidental is under a court-approved limit of $96 million 
in total financing for the controversial museum named for the multinational oil 
company's 92-year-old founder and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
When the museum was first planned, the Westwood-based company said it would 
absorb start-up costs of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
But a newly released deposition of Hillary Gibson, the museum's fund-raising 
and financial director and a close Hammer associate, shows that initial 
expenditures have increased to $7.5 million -- which the company said has been 
paid from income produced by a $36-million endowment annuity. 
</P>
<P>
The increase appeared to reflect higher than expected costs associated with 
preparing the museum for its scheduled Nov. 28 opening. The art center plans to 
open with an exhibit of work by Russian Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich, 
organized by the National Gallery of Art in Washington and which opened there 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's March 20 deposition was originally a confidential part of the court 
record in a lawsuit by Occidental shareholders opposed to museum expenditures. 
It was unsealed Thursday by the Delaware Supreme Court under recently altered 
rules that limit secrecy in appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The court is considering an appeal from a Delaware chancery court judge's 
August ruling that Occidental directors acted properly in approving financing 
for the museum, which is to house the art collection amassed by Hammer and paid 
for with Occidental corporate money and Hammer's own funds. 
</P>
<P>
In the deposition, Gibson was asked if the $1-million figure previously 
advanced by Occidental as its budgeted start-up costs for the museum was 
accurate as of late March. "No, it is not true," Gibson said. At the time of 
the deposition, the settlement that included the $96-million cap had been 
agreed to by Occidental but was not yet approved by the court. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson declined in the deposition to identify the Japanese firm or to say 
whether it does business with Occidental. Gibson said negotiations over the 
$13-million transaction involved a payment schedule for the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson and Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley again declined to identify the 
Japanese firm or its business relationship with Occidental in a telephone 
interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Gibson deposition also detailed ambitious museum fund-raising plans, 
including a proposed series of 20 "hard hat and caviar parties" at which 
wealthy museum patrons would don construction gear as they mingled in the 
unfinished museum drinking vodka and Champagne and eating caviar and hors 
d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental said 15 of the hard hat events have been scheduled and that the 
events began this week -- though Gibson said the hard-hat attire had become 
only symbolic for persons attending the parties. Another event described by 
Gibson last March -- a private dinner party for the USC School of Architecture 
-- was held Thursday evening.

BLACK REACTION TO 'THE CIVIL WAR': PAIN AND PRIDE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: FOR SOME AFRICAN-AMERICAN VIEWERS, KEN BURNS' DOCUMENTARY TOOK A 
BIT OF THE PATINA OFF LINCOLN'S IMAGE AS THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Initially, Magie Raine had no intention of watching "The Civil War" on public 
television this week. Like many African Americans, she knew enough about the 
story to know it wasn't one she wanted to see again. 
</P>
<P>
And she had little reason to expect that another production by a white 
filmmaker -- even one that took 11 hours to tell the story -- would tell her 
anything new, or even present the story fairly regarding African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling was, 'I've been through this. I don't want to see any more of 
this,' " said Raine, a Los Angeles-based caterer and health food producer. 
"I've seen this too many times and it's too depressing." 
</P>
<P>
Then she started watching. 
</P>
<P>
The story was as wrenching as ever, worse in some ways because producer Ken 
Burns appeared to pull no punches -- about racism both North and South, about 
the political and economic issues that outweighed slavery as a real cause for 
the war. But Raine was glued to the set. And somehow, out of the pain, came 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
"I was depressed, but I got a great sense of pride watching the black 
soldiers," whose stories producer Ken Burns made a point of telling, Raine 
said. In the end, the program was no less than cathartic, bringing to the fore 
feelings that had been long buried and inspiring a new determination to help 
her people begin to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Raine is not alone in having deep and sometimes painful emotions stirred by 
"The Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
The series, which aired last Sunday through Thursday on public television 
stations across the nation and will be rebroadcast on KCET Channel 28 in Los 
Angeles tomorrow from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., thrust ugly truths about slavery and 
bigotry once again into the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
It raised questions about the portrayal of the role of African Americans 
throughout American history, even raising questions among some in the community 
about Burns' depiction of black issues. And for some black viewers, it took a 
bit of the patina off Lincoln's image as the Great Emancipator. 
</P>
<P>
While figures showing the ethnic breakdown of viewers are not available, "The 
Civil War" did garner record ratings for public television. Its first night, an 
estimated 14 million people watched the program, a record for a Public 
Broadcasting Service series premiere, and by Wednesday, the ratings had 
increased by 3% in 24 markets monitored by A. C. Nielsen Co. Overall, the 
series averaged a 9.0 rating with a 13% share of the viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It just blew my mind," Kasey Kennedy, a recent graduate of Loyola-Marymount 
college who lives in Compton, said of the program. What affected him most, he 
said, was realizing the depth of hatred felt for blacks by whites in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in the history of all mankind have I seen one race of people hate 
another so," Kennedy said. "They never let up. Even in their last few minutes 
on Earth they were talking about killing the niggers . . . It let me see just 
how real it really was, that racial bigotry and hatred." 
</P>
<P>
Even Lincoln, revered by most African Americans as "The Great Emancipator," was 
no great civil libertarian, according to the series. 
</P>
<P>
Burns painted a picture of a Lincoln who freed the slaves in order to crush the 
South, in order to gain more soldiers for the North while crippling the economy 
of the Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
And that was painful to watch. "Lincoln is still a hero to a lot of blacks," 
said Jacques Williams, special assistant to the dean of students at Charles R. 
Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles. "And while the program 
makes him out to be a real decent man, he doesn't come off as a great crusader 
for the freedom of the slaves. So it puts some holes in that mythology." 
</P>
<P>
John Connolly, who teaches social studies and geography at the Sheenway School, 
a private, black-run inner-city school, said that some of the most difficult 
parts of the program for him came when letters were read from Confederate 
soldiers to their families. 
</P>
<P>
One letter "referred to something about, 'the Union has got to see that we 
Southerners cannot live together with niggers,' " Connolly said. "When you hear 
that letter it strikes a chord in you and you really realize that there are 
people who are still out there who are like that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Connolly said he encouraged his 7th to 12th graders to watch the program 
and is hoping to obtain videotapes of it to use in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they can learn who they are as a people and where they have come from 
in such a short time," Connolly said. "We're not talking about a very long time 
between the Civil War period and now. And civil rights issues have not been 
around in this country just since the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
The program brought home the hurt in more subtle ways to some members of the 
black community. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Horne, a professor of black studies at UC Santa Barbara, said that 
despite its in-depth presentation and its refusal to accept most myths of the 
period, the program did not attempt to shake the old romantic image of the 
South and its leaders. And that, he said, shows that even among many of the 
best educated and most well-meaning whites, there may still be a tendency to 
avoid a complete condemnation of the Confederacy and what it stood for. 
</P>
<P>
"The Confederates tried to overthrow the government of the United States so 
they could continue slavery," Horne said. "I don't see anything romantic about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Lee, for example, is portrayed as a gentleman who, while torn about 
whether to remain with his West Point-educated colleagues in the North or fight 
for his home turf with the Confederacy, nonetheless fought the good fight once 
he made his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they were sufficiently harsh towards people who were by any 
definition traitors," Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Clark, a community activist and journalist, agreed, and said that while 
the program did discuss black soldiers, it did not address the extent to which 
they volunteered in the North and were pressed into service in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"The Southerners that went into the Army, most of them carried their black 
servants with them," Clark said. "And they went in and fought alongside them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, according to Horne and others, "The Civil War" is certainly a far cry 
from previous attempts to chronicle the period, from "Gone With the Wind" to D. 
W. Griffith's 1915 silent white-supremacist film "Birth of a Nation." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a step forward, away from the moonlight and magnolia school of 
betrayals," Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
"The other programs that I've seen relating to the same thing, didn't bring out 
a lot of the things that this program did," agreed Carol Green, an 
administrative assistant at the Los Angeles chapter of the Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the scenes and descriptions were unpleasant, Green said, but they 
should be viewed and discussed -- again and again -- despite that. 
</P>
<P>
"To me its like the Jews and the Holocaust," Green said. "A lot of people say 
we shouldn't watch things like ("The Civil War"). In my opinion you, have to 
watch things like that to be aware, to know what happened. This did happen, and 
it's something you have to face. 
</P>

A TANGLE FOR INQUIRING MINDS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER, OFTEN ACCUSED OF JOURNALISTIC IMPROPRIETIES, 
CRIES FOUL OVER CBS' PROFILE OF THE PAPER ON '60 MINUTES' SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some conflicts simply invite spectators to sit back and enjoy the fray, so 
fittingly suited are the combatants -- Godzilla vs. Rodan, Truman Capote vs. 
Gore Vidal. Count among them the current clash between journalism's two titans 
of the sensational expose, "60 Minutes" of CBS and the National Enquirer of the 
grocery store check-out line. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt lots of people would relish seeing the National Enquirer -- "the 
National Rag" to many a burned celebrity -- squirm under the tight focus of a 
"60 Minutes" investigation. And "60 Minutes" detractors might be cheered to 
hear that the Enquirer has accused the CBS broadcast of improper journalistic 
practices, including the use of allegedly stolen material, for its piece on the 
Enquirer being aired Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Enquirer has been made nervous enough that it has hired a well-known 
private eye to track the source of the material that landed in "60 Minutes' " 
hands. And adding an element of intrigue is the tale of one of "60 Minutes' " 
main sources, a print reporter whose own article on the Enquirer appeared 
earlier this week in Los Angeles magazine, that he was allegedly harassed by 
the detective, and that his phone may even have been tapped. 
</P>
<P>
The Enquirer says that its detective has harassed no one, and that its lawyers 
have only tried to dissuade "60 Minutes" from airing a "false story." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the friction is the Enquirer's legendary system of sourcing -- 
its super-secret list of individuals who are paid for juicy tidbits used by the 
supermarket tabloid, mostly in stories about Hollywood celebrities. The 
tabloid's inclination toward the provocative and near-incredible angle -- 
Roseanne Barr using voodoo curses, for instance -- has made it the scourge of 
that element of Hollywood most often its subject. 
</P>
<P>
The Enquirer has always defended its veracity, standing on its vast network of 
paid sources. 
</P>
<P>
But that network of sources is what comes under scrutiny in Sunday's broadcast, 
on which Ed Bradley is the correspondent. The Enquirer fears that the segment 
will try to demonstrate that the publication makes up stories with phony 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter trying to dissuade the broadcast from that theme, Michael Boylan, 
vice chairman of the Enquirer's parent company, the GP Group, told "60 Minutes" 
executive producer Don Hewitt that part of the Enquirer's list of confidential 
sources had been stolen in the paper's "war" with a group of celebrities and 
their private detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Boylan said in the letter that the Enquirer's complex system of paying its 
sources, devised to maintain secrecy, had not been understood by "60 Minutes" 
and that it sometimes even causes confusion among sources, because they may be 
asked to get information without being told the full story to which they are 
contributing. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it might look like the Enquirer makes up sources to support its 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely the conclusion arrived at by Rod Lurie, a contributing editor 
for Los Angeles magazine who was interviewed by "60 Minutes" for its broadcast 
and, like "60 Minutes," came into possession of a 10-page list of the 
Enquirer's paid sources earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie's own investigation into the Enquirer led him to a trail of sources who 
told him they were regularly paid for information relating to stories they knew 
nothing about. 
</P>
<P>
While it might seem that the prospect of "60 Minutes" skewering the Enquirer 
would be a cause for cheer in Hollywood, the impending broadcast has had the 
opposite effect in some corners of show business, where for weeks many have 
lived in fear of being exposed as sources for the dreaded supermarket scourge. 
Publicists, agents, even the occasional celebrity who fed tips to the Enquirer, 
dreaded the revelation. 
</P>
<P>
But Grace Diekhaus, producer of the "60 Minutes" piece, said that they have 
nothing to fear. "We weren't interested in 'outing' these people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Lurie, Diekhaus said that her dealings with the Enquirer have not been 
overtly confrontational, but she thinks the tabloid has gotten itself unduly 
overwrought. The Enquirer abruptly canceled an on-camera interview, and then 
asked her to submit questions in writing. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do that for the President of the United States, so why do it for the 
National Enquirer?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Boylan, in an interview, said that editor Iain Calder and articles editor Steve 
Coz declined to appear on camera for "60 Minutes" because they believed they 
would either be forced to compromise their sources or would appear too evasive 
to help their cause. In any event, he said, he believed "60 Minutes" was not 
interested in the Enquirer's explanation of its accounting methods, but is 
after something more sensational. 
</P>
<P>
Diekhaus has another explanation: "The people who poke their nose into 
everybody else's business didn't want anybody poking their nose into theirs."

EGGPLANT PICKS FIRM GROUND; 
</P>
<P>
REVIEW: DESPITE THE STARS ON THEIR ALBUM, MEMBERS OF THE BAND DECIDE TO STAY 
TRUE TO THEIR NAMESAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could it be that Eggplant -- a rock band whose collective personality is as 
quiet, unassuming and unflamboyant as its vegetative namesake -- is starting to 
see stars? 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. It's true that stars appear all over the front and back covers of 
the Huntington Beach band's new album, "Sad Astrology." But they shine with a 
wry twinkle: The front cover looks like a still from "The Jetsons," and the 
back-cover painting illustrates the calamity that would ensue if every phony 
romantic pledge to love somebody "till the stars fall from the sky" were, up in 
the heavens, to be taken literally. 
</P>
<P>
Here on earth, Eggplant's members shrug at the idea of projecting themselves 
into the pop firmament. Aside from drummer Dave Tabone, who is the somewhat 
rambunctious contrarian of the band, bassist John Kelly and 
singer-songwriter-guitarists Jeff Beals and Jon Melkerson are some of the 
quietest, humblest, least presumptuous people ever to strap on an instrument 
and plug it into an amplifier. 
</P>
<P>
While other bands in Eggplant's alternative-rock, college radio-oriented 
bailiwick tend to mock the conventions of pop stardom, they still try to 
cultivate some sort of image, usually as anti-stars. Eggplant's members come 
off as pleasant but retiring innocents, possessed of a quirky sense of humor, 
and passive in the face of the demanding pop career-ladder that others climb 
with all limbs flailing. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, most of those climbers probably would give a limb or two to make 
an album as strong as "Sad Astrology." Coming after "Monkeybars," the 
rough-hewn but vibrant debut album the band released last year, "Sad Astrology" 
signals that Eggplant, humble or not, is a genuine alternative rock contender. 
(Review, F4) 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether Eggplant will be able to do the sorts of things that 
potential contenders do to pull themselves up that ladder to greater 
visibility. Gathered over pizza last week at an Italian restaurant in 
Huntington Beach (nobody would order the eggplant, a dish that none of the four 
members ever touches -- "A handful of dirt would be better. It's good to 
throw," pronounced Tabone -- the band members were keeping their expectations 
low. 
</P>
<P>
Successful alternative rock bands usually build an audience via incessant 
touring. That isn't in the cards for Eggplant, whose members either don't want 
to quit steady jobs or, in Beals' case, can't even think of quitting because he 
has two children to support, a newborn daughter and a 2-year-old son he named 
after the whimsical rock hero, Jonathan Richman. 
</P>
<P>
"If the record does really well, we'll consider touring, but right now it's not 
feasible," said Beals, at 27 the oldest member of Eggplant. "It doesn't matter 
whether you tour unless your record's a higher-profile record." 
</P>
<P>
Limited touring in California and the Southwest after the release of 
"Monkeybars" didn't make much difference in spurring album sales, Beals said, 
and he doesn't expect it would have an impact on the new album, either -- 
although a fall tour of California and the Northwest is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
"We were totally unknown. Now we're just partially unknown," Beals said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who (tour extensively) have this unrealistic thing about 
stardom," said Melkerson, whose almost diffident manner contrasts with his 
striking ability as a guitarist and songwriter. "You have to be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that Eggplant doesn't want to be well-known, Beals said. That desire 
"is there, but it's just so rare to be able to do that. For the amount of bands 
out there, you're foolish to ever think you're going to be a star. You might as 
well expect the least and have fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
The dissenting voice is Tabone, the only compactly built member in a band of 
6-footers. "I don't want to be greedy about it, but I want more," he said, 
adding that he'd be delighted to go on tour for months on end. "I just want it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why he drums so hard-core," Melkerson noted with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
It's hardly a surprise that the question of how avidly one should pursue a 
dream, or any course of action, crops up often in Eggplant's songs. Beals' 
humorous but wistful "If You See the Real World Coming" laments how hostile 
real life is toward our dreams. 
</P>
<P>
The real world is for the sad, sad people who gave up their dream long ago, 
</P>
<P>
 Who once wanted something, but now go to work 
</P>
<P>
 'Cause they ran out of places to go. 
</P>
<P>
In such Melkerson songs as "Confidant" (a more polished version of the ballad 
that graced "Monkeybars") and "Animal Song," there are recurring references to 
a struggle to overcome inertia and gain the confidence or determination to act. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take a step, but I don't want to fall," Melkerson intones on "Animal 
Song," a fine parable that seems to be about the importance of acting in the 
face of doubts about one's own adequacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't tell you what it was about," said Melkerson, who says his lyrical 
method is to tuck away images and phrases that he runs into by accident, then 
weave them into songs. "But there's enough information there for somebody to 
get a mood out of it, or draw some conclusion. Subconsciously, I probably 
inflict my own ideas on it, even though I'm trying to stay a distance from it." 
</P>
<P>
Melkerson said he always thought his songwriting method was strange, and maybe 
just plain incorrect. When he recently took a songwriting class at Golden West 
College, he was happy to learn that it's a recommended practice to filter odd 
fragments and chance encounters into songs. 
</P>
<P>
Beals' material tends to be more whimsical, with easier-to-follow story lines. 
But he, too, mines his encounters with the real world. "The Wild Ones (Cycle on 
the Lawn)" began in Laguna Beach traffic where Beals glimpsed an 
androgynous-looking couple on a beat up Harley-Davidson. Using Ray Davies' 
quirky but respectful character sketches as a model, Beals translated that into 
his song's strange but warm, sweet tale of a butch biker girl and a 
cross-dressing boy who fall deeply in love. 
</P>
<P>
After spending all of $800 on their do-it-yourself debut album, Eggplant had 
about 10 times that budget to record "Sad Astrology." For the first time, they 
worked with a producer, Russ Tolman, instead of just plugging their instruments 
in, setting the dials and letting fly. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up with a lot of ideas we wouldn't have thought of, to keep the record 
interesting," said a typically modest Melkerson. 
</P>
<P>
Beals said that in the early stages of recording, "I was totally worried" that 
Eggplant would emerge with a too-glossy package. "The process of recording it 
seemed so structured, I thought it was going to take away all our originality. 
But the last few days in the studio, as the songs were being finished, it began 
to sound the way we play live." 
</P>
<P>
Melkerson permitted himself just a bit of well-justified, though quietly 
stated, self-congratulation. "In the end," he said, "I don't think we could 
have made a better record." 
</P>
<P>
Eggplant plays a free concert Sunday at 4 p.m. at the Balboa Pier gazebo on 
Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach. The band also will play at a record release 
party Wednesday at 9 p.m. at Club Lingerie, 6507 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood. For 
information and free admission, call Dr. Dream Records at (714) 997-9387.

FACES . . . : TROUBADOUR J.D. SOUTHER FOUND ACTING AN OFFER HE COULDN'T REFUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAUREN LIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It all fits the pattern, says J.D. Souther about his resurging career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cliche to say life moves in cycles, but for me, it does -- in huge, 
obvious cycles,"explains the musician recently turned actor. "In the '50s, my 
life was full of awesome experiences. In the '60s, it was mostly goofing off, 
motorcycle riding, chasing women. The '70s were really productive, and then in 
the '80s -- about '82 -- I just went back to partyin' and gettin' high." 
</P>
<P>
Souther's recent upswing might then be predictable, but he appreciates it 
anyway. His first actual acting job is featured in the motion picture 
"Postcards From the Edge.' He also guest-starred in "thirtysomething" last 
season as the rumpled activist with whom Hope was most likely to have an 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
But acting marks a major career shift for Souther, who's perhaps best known for 
helping define the so-called Southern California sound of the 1970s. Then a 
songwriter who collaborated with the likes of the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt and 
Bonnie Raitt, Souther wrote or co-wrote hits like "Prisoner in Disguise" and 
"Best of My Love." As a solo artist, Souther made the top 10 with a 1979 
single, "You're Only Lonely." But his last solo album, in 1985, "was that 
unfortunate curiosity that's later called a 'critical success' -- meaning 
nobody bought it. After that I just sort of dried up for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Souther got into acting, he says, "because I actually couldn't resist it any 
longer. I think it was probably just peer pressure -- my friends kept telling 
me I should act." But Since he's gotten his new career off the ground, Souther 
adds, his old one is picking up as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of schizophrenic right now," he says. "Today, I met with people 
about two different movie projects, and I spent a couple of hours on the piano. 
I am going to make a record this winter. 
</P>
<P>
"Either I'm going 160 m.p.h. or I'm parked," he continues. "I guess I'm going 
160 again." LAUREN LIPTON

NEW NC-17 RATING MAY GIVE SOME FILMS MORE EXPOSURE; 
</P>
<P>
HOME VIDEO: POLICIES AGAINST CARRYING X-RATED MOVIES MAY RELAX UNDER NEW 
GUIDELINES, INDUSTRY OBSERVERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The change in the motion-picture industry's rating system, eliminating the 
infamous X rating in favor of NC-17, may lead to some films receiving wider 
exposure in the home-video market. 
</P>
<P>
Home video executives contacted this week said that it was too early to know 
how their industry will react to the NC-17 rating (meaning not for children 
under 17), but many guessed that some films will benefit. Stores that have 
policies against carrying X-rated movies may respond differently to NC-17 
movies, and stores that keep their X-rated titles in a separate section may be 
willing to display NC-17 titles with their main stock. 
</P>
<P>
"Some films were in the porn sections that didn't belong there," said John 
Thrasher, product manager of Tower Video, speaking of stores outside his chain. 
"They were there because there was nowhere else to put them. So people who 
wanted these titles would have to go to the X sections to find them, which many 
people didn't want to do. But that may change with this new rating, which may 
bring respectability to some of the serious movies that have an X rating." 
</P>
<P>
"Some retailers who carry X-rated product may have to rethink how they handle 
films in this category," agreed Paul Culberg, executive vice president and 
chief operating officer of RCA/Columbia. "The new rating gives them some 
options that weren't there before." 
</P>
<P>
The new rating may help Miramax's "Tie Me up, Tie Me Down" -- distributed by 
RCA/Columbia -- which was released theatrically without a rating to avoid the 
promotional restrictions placed on X-rated movies. It's tentatively scheduled 
to be released on home video by the end of the year and would have faced 
problems because stores that don't carry X-rated films often don't carry 
unrated films either, recognizing that they might have gotten an X if submitted 
for classification. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it can be resubmitted for an NC-17 rating," Culberg said. "This will be a 
good test to see if more retailers will carry it with the new rating." 
</P>
<P>
Blockbuster Video, the nation's largest chain, with 1,435 stores, has not yet 
decided how it will handle NC-17 films. Blockbuster doesn't carry X-rated 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is certain yet," Blockbuster vice president Allan Caplan said Friday, 
"but we'll probably look at this on a case-by-case basis, as we always have. 
We're not going to say we're automatically going to carry all NC-17 titles. The 
rating may be different, but that doesn't change the content of the movie. 
There are still titles that we won't carry." 
</P>
<P>
How about special NC-17 sections in video stores? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that will happen," Caplan said. "There are maybe six to 12 films 
a year that will get this NC-17 rating. That's not enough to warrant a special 
section." 
</P>
<P>
Some retailers expressed concern that porn-film producers may choose to submit 
their movies to the Motion Picture Assn. of America for the NC-17 rating. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's possible for something like 'Debbie Does Dallas' to get an NC-17, then 
something is wrong," declared Peter Margo, executive vice president of the 
Palmer Video chain, which has 30 stores. "There's an obvious difference between 
a serious, mature movie and a porn movie. This NC-17 doesn't make that 
distinction. So we still may have a problem -- new rating or not."

SHAKESPEARE NOT DESCRIBED AS 'UN-AMERICAN' ON TAPE;

THEATER: COUNCILMAN LITTRELL SAID WORKS ARE 'NOT AMERICAN,' TAPE RECORDING OF 
MEETING INDICATES.

City Councilman Raymond T. Littrell did not say that the works of William 
Shakespeare are "un-American," as a Grove Shakespeare Festival official 
asserted, during recent public debate over city support of the financially 
troubled theater troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bradac, producing artistic director of the Festival, had told The Times 
that he was "surprised to hear that Littrell believes Shakespeare and the 
classics are un-American." 
</P>
<P>
A review of a tape recording of the City Council meeting in question revealed 
no use of the term "un-American." Littrell did note that Shakespeare is not 
American and that he believes the troupe should concentrate on American 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Littrell, calling for clarification, said he believes the distinction is 
important because he feels that "un-American" connotes subversion, and "I don't 
believe that people who go to Shakespeare are that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't quoting him," Bradac said yesterday. "I'm restating what he said. In 
essence, that's what he said," the director maintained. JIM TORTOLANO

POP BEAT / ALTERNATIVE ROCK: IN THE UNDERGROUND, DEAD CAN DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The CMJ New Music Report's Top 150 album chart is the master scoreboard in the 
world of alternative rock, and the latest list of records making the rounds on 
college radio and in underground circles offers the usual diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar names like John Hiatt and the Pretenders mingle with Cavedogs and 
Strawberry Zots. The music? Punk, folk, progressive, ethnic, art-metal, rap, 
electro-doom-rock and reggae are all represented. Even under this open door 
policy, it's possible to be surprised. Consider Dead Can Dance, whose artfully 
designed album of ancient folk and church music is one of the hottest items on 
the chart. This edition of Pop Beat focuses on alternative releases from 
independent labels, rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
*** Andy Prieboy, ". . . Upon My Wicked Son." Dr. Dream. The Los Angeles singer 
gets caught up in arty-smarty cleverness as he jumps from progressive blues to 
Weill-like theater tune to French cabaret, but at least he's out on the front 
lines grappling with fundamental human matters. He turns Canned Heat's "On the 
Road Again" into a Wagnerian blues with a "Gimme Shelter" edge (Beth Hooker as 
Merry Clayton), and the mock-gospel "Montezuma" portrays the grim consequences 
of faith. But one song dwarfs everything else on the album: "Tomorrow Wendy," a 
cynic's hymn from a doomed soul (a suicidal woman with AIDS). Prieboy pumps the 
emotions of bitterness and lost innocence to operatic proportions, the repeated 
gathering and release of tension creates a compelling dynamic, and guest star 
Johnette Nopalitano (whose band Concrete Blonde does the song on its current 
album) wails her defiance to the heavens. A great piece of record-making. 
</P>
<P>
*** Dead Can Dance, "Aion." 4AD. While progressive pop artists are 
globe-hopping in search of new sounds, the Ireland-based duo of Brendan Perry 
and Lisa Gerrard travels through time for their fifth Dead Can Dance album, 
which offers an assortment of dance, worship and narrative music from the 
Middle Ages. No tricks, no irony, just a touch of personalizing and 
modernizing. While it's rigorous and formal, the tapestry of pipes and booming 
hand drums, tambourines and bells, rich-voiced chorales and Gerrard's warm lead 
vocals draw you into a world of mystery and beauty. Its success is an 
encouraging sign of independence and openness in a market that sometimes seems 
as predictable and orthodox as the music business it's an alternative to. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Jello Biafra with D.O.A., "Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors." 
Alternative Tentacles. Prime-time punk's best on-stage wild man and pioneering 
anti-censorship force teams with the Vancouver punk vets for a crash course in 
current events at thrash tempo. The sound and the themes may be familiar 
(shopping malls, "progress," El Salvador, the CIA, the corporate game, the rock 
game), but Biafra's quavery warble expresses the glee of subversion, and 
D.O.A.'s tough attack gives it freshness. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Teenage Fanclub, "A Catholic Education." Matador. The group is from 
Glasgow, but it sounds like one of the Seattle Sub Pop bands: a thickness of 
churning, chopping guitars conveying adolescent longing and alienation. The raw 
sound is invigorating, and it's a good enough ride for guitar-band fans, but 
the vocals are buried, the songwriting is undeveloped and there aren't enough 
transcendent instrumental performances to compensate.

The pastor of the largest Episcopal parish on the West Coast has called on 
churches to "stand against (our) nation going to war" with demonstrations and 
civil disobedience if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Rev. George Regas, rector of the 3,000-member All Saints Episcopal 
Church in Pasadena, agrees with overwhelming religious sentiment that Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait was villainous, he told his congregation last Sunday that 
"war is no longer a viable option in 1990. War is always tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Most Christian leaders have urged the United States to negotiate a solution to 
the crisis and have questioned President Bush's reference in early August to 
preserving the American "way of life" as he dispatched armed forces to oil-rich 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
And, most recently, evangelical activist-editor Jim Wallis has urged U.S. troop 
withdrawal and Regas' own bishop, the Right Rev. Frederick Borsch, has pointed 
to troublesome ironies in the American moves. 
</P>
<P>
The Sisters of Mercy, a 7,000-member, nationwide Catholic religious order based 
in Louisville, Ky., this week opposed the U.S. military response and urged a 
peaceful resolution. "We oppose any invasion or bombing of Iraq," said the 
organization's statement. 
</P>
<P>
But few, if any, religious figures have signaled clearly that they would stage 
protests against American military action. "We must go to jail, we must do 
anything to stand in the name of God against another monstrous war," Regas 
exhorted from his pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners at All Saints probably weren't surprised at Regas' comments during 
his sermon and a forum on the Persian Gulf crisis that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Many times before, the impassioned liberal priest had condemned nuclear 
weapons, U.S. policy in Nicaragua or increases in military spending. And the 
church became the first Episcopal sanctuary for Central American refugees in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling "severe" criticism that he and All Saints received for opposing the 
Vietnam War in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Regas said that people asked 
then how the church dared not to support the President at a critical time. 
</P>
<P>
The parish also stirred some controversy during the 1980s when it helped to 
found and then housed the Interfaith Center to Stop the Arms Race. As 
contributions dried up late last year when the Cold War ended, the center moved 
out and is debating its future. 
</P>
<P>
Regas, whose parish delves into social-political subjects like few other 
congregations, said the spirit of God was calling the churches to declare that 
war would be "preposterous" at a time when prospects for world peace and a 
"peace dividend" of anti-poverty money looked so promising. 
</P>
<P>
"The church must stop blessing war. . . . War lays hold of the noblest elements 
in the human character, with which we could make heaven on Earth, and uses them 
to make hell on Earth," Regas said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein is an unwholesome 
character," Regas said. "I don't want to give any support to him." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Americans are right to support President Bush and pray for him. 
"We ought to love the soldiers who have gone there because the country asked 
them to go," Regas said. 
</P>
<P>
Churches as varied as Angelus Temple in Los Angeles and St. Thomas More 
Catholic Church in Rialto have made special prayers for U.S. soldiers and for a 
peaceful solution to the crisis. Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos of New York 
asked western hemisphere parishes last Sunday to join in a national prayer for 
peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the San Luis Rey United Methodist Church and Temple Etz Chaim in 
Thousand Oaks have mailed letters and cards to troops. 
</P>
<P>
The 151,000-member Church of the Brethren, a pacifist denomination based in 
Elgin, Ill., has joined with several Mennonite bodies to declare an "oil-free 
Sunday" on Oct. 21. Church members will be asked to curtail their normal use of 
gasoline and oil that day to illustrate "that our nation is willing to go to 
war to keep the oil flowing." 
</P>
<P>
Economic reasons for stationing American troops in Saudi Arabia disturbed 
church leaders and groups such as the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc., 
which passed a resolution this month in Los Angeles to oppose spilling American 
blood for oil. 
</P>
<P>
The evangelical magazine Sojourners, published in Washington, decrying the 
"distinctly low profile" taken by American churches on the issue, says in its 
October issue that Hussein must be opposed, but by regional or U.N.-supervised 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
The predominant U.S. military presence on the side of Kuwait seems directed 
toward "making the world safe more for feudalism and gas guzzling than for 
democracy," wrote Wallis, the editor. "Are we prepared to bomb the children of 
Baghdad, if necessary, to protect 'our oil'?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
A cautious statement was issued by the National Council of Churches' Executive 
Coordinating Committee in mid-September. The growing American military forces 
and "apparent open-ended nature of the U.S. involvement in the region give rise 
to serious questions which we believe the churches should consider with care," 
said the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Rev. Teruo Kawata, interim United Church of Christ executive for 
Southern California, said in a regional newsletter to 140 congregations this 
month that he "would not presume to second-guess the President" in the 
difficult crisis, but he urged prayers that Bush and Hussein "not act out of 
pride and anger." 
</P>
<P>
Borsch, writing in his diocesan newspaper to church members in six counties, 
said there were plenty of tactical and moral questions to ask. Without swift 
containment of Hussein, the Iraqi leader could have been emboldened to swallow 
up more neighboring countries, Borsch suggested. "And what of the day when 
Hussein may have nuclear weapons?" the Los Angeles bishop wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Borsch said things rarely turn out the way planners plan. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter our intentions, our long-term military presence may make matters 
worse for everyone but a few oligarchies that do not exactly represent American 
ideas of democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressures on our own already weakened economy grow. It would be, at the 
least, ironic if, in seeking to keep our economic lifestyle, we should lose 
it."

NORTHEAST SOVIET REGION TO GET ITS FIRST CHURCH 
</P>

MAGADAN, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has never been a church in the entire Magadan region of the Soviet Far 
East, an area three times as big as California and with a population of 
500,000. 
</P>
<P>
But now, a Russian Orthodox church is being built in the center of Magadan, a 
seaport on the Sea of Okhotsk that serves as the capital of the most 
Northeastern region of Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
The church will stand next to a 60-foot-high memorial to the victims of 
Stalin's infamous prison camps. The memorial is scheduled to be completed by 
sculptor Ernst Neizvestny within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1930s the huge Magadan region remained virtually uninhabited except 
for nomadic reindeer herders and natives living in scattered villages along the 
coast of the Chukchi, East Siberian and Bering seas. 
</P>
<P>
Then Stalin started shipping hundreds of thousands of prisoners to the area. 
More than 100 camps of the Gulag system were erected and support communities 
were built around them. Everything in the region evolved around the prison 
camps from the 1930s through the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we were an atheist nation there never was a reason to build churches 
here. It was the policy of our government to discourage belief in a god," 
explained Vyazheslav Kobets, the region's governor. "Of course, 
pre-revolutionary Russian Orthodox churches still stand in many places in the 
Soviet Union. But they were never here." 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a great deal of curiosity about religion everywhere in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors are besieged by Soviet citizens, some of whom have been 
lifelong atheists, for any information they can get on their views of God. It 
is part of ane emerging phenomenon of people searching for something to believe 
in now that they have lost faith and confidence in the Communist Party and 
their government. 
</P>
<P>
The 32 members of a medical expedition to the Magadan region, sponsored by the 
University of Alaska's Institute of Circumpolar Health Studies, said Soviet 
doctors repeatedly asked them this summer if they believe in God and if they 
attend church. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the medical group included MDs, dentists, psychiatrists, hospital 
administrators, dental hygienists and physicians' assistants. 
</P>
<P>
"In one meeting when the subject of God was brought up, we asked the Soviet 
doctors what they believed in," said Anchorage psychiatrist Bill Richards, 49. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were brought up in the Communist system to be atheist and 
always taught not to believe in God, but to believe in the state rather than 
spiritual forces." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wandal Winn, 44, an Anchorage psychiatrist observed: "There is tremendous 
hunger in this country for ethics, morals and values to replace something they 
feel we have that they're missing. The Soviet people are in a vacuum, looking 
around for meaning in life. I have been asked by Soviet doctors if I had a 
Bible I could give them." 
</P>
<P>
Winn said he believes the Soviet Union "is fertile soil for fundamentalistic 
Christianity. I would not be surprised to see it coming on very strong."

When Father Leonid Kishkovsky, 43, the first Eastern Orthodox president of the 
National Council of Churches, was in Los Angeles this week he praised the 
Soviet legislature for lifting a longtime ban on religious education at 
churches and ended government funding of atheism classes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Critically important in the new law . . 
</P>
<P>
. is what appears to be the disengagement of the state from the propagation of 
atheism. If the churches were given freedom of educating children but the state 
continued to propagate atheism through the curriculum in schools, what you 
would have is still second-class status for believers. That is a very 
significant step . . . to create an even playing field, as it were. The law 
removes the official advantages of atheism from education."

COUPLE PLAY TO SEPARATE DRUMMERS; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: NICK PYZOW LEADS HIS OWN WELL-KNOWN ROCK BAND, WHILE NEW WIFE, ANNY 
CELSI, IS THE CO-SONGWRITER FOR THE TEARJERKERS, A 3-YEAR-OLD POP QUINTET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having married in March, Nick and Anny are each devoted, wide-eyed and have 
sights set on a big future. 
</P>
<P>
They share many of the usual things that young married folk do, as well as an 
obsessive love for music. But for this couple to realize their dreams, they 
say, two nice record deals would sure help. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Pyzow and Anny Celsi are local songwriter/musicians, still paying the dues 
endemic of young pop careers, hoping that success lurks just over the horizon. 
But they are following separate paths in pursuing those goals. 
</P>
<P>
Celsi is the co-songwriter for the Tearjerkers, a 3-year-old quintet whose 
irresistible pop harmonies and hook-laden guitars are based in the L.A. 
tradition of the Go-Go's and the Bangles. 
</P>
<P>
Pyzow, who until recently was based in Anaheim, has been plugging away at his 
craft since the early 1980s, first as a solo acoustic artist before 
establishing the Nick Pyzow Band. 
</P>
<P>
Pyzow's music, like that of the Tearjerkers, is steeped in strong pop 
sensibilities, but his band favors the country rock/jangly guitar blend of the 
Byrds and an oft-cited early-Springsteenian vocal quality and swagger. 
</P>
<P>
In between his tireless work performing at clubs throughout Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, Pyzow has independently released a batch of singles and three 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
His latest LP, "Adobe &amp; Diamonds," fleshes out the band's trademark sound 
while offering glimmers of musical growth. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the record delves into Pyzow's past, reviving "For Our Youth" 
from his 1983 six-track debut release, "Right at Night." 
</P>
<P>
As Pyzow explains it, his original solo acoustic version of the track has come 
to sound like a demo version to him. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a song I always envisioned as bigger," Pyzow said during an interview 
this week. "When 'Right at Night' came out, that was indicative of my sound, 
real lean and sparse. Then, when I put the band together, all these (new) ideas 
started coming in, and they wouldn't go away." 
</P>
<P>
The number has always been a crowd favorite during the band's performances, "so 
when it came time to do the album we figured, let's give it a shot," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And he says the LP version captures the energy of the live renditions, mainly 
because "the cut you hear on the record we did on the first take." 
</P>
<P>
The other nine tracks on "Adobe &amp; Diamonds," for the most part, introduce a 
more bluesy tinge to the band's sound but do little more to broaden it. 
</P>
<P>
A glaring exception, however, is "Word on a Wire," one of two songs on the 
album written by bassist Rick Staples. Combining harmonies, keyboards and a 
range of driving percussion, the Jamaican-flavored "Wire" marks the band's most 
radical musical detour to date. 
</P>
<P>
Staples, formerly of a local band called Fan Shen, has never before contributed 
songs to a Nick Pyzow Band record, and only occasionally writes songs any more, 
Pyzow said. But since recording the latest album "was very much more a total 
band effort" than previous efforts, Pyzow agreed to include some of Staples' 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
"Wire," Pyzow says, "was a wild hair. It really stands out when we play it, and 
we all liked it." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "I wouldn't say it is an indication of a new direction." 
</P>
<P>
But the latest songs Pyzow has been writing, he says, are moving into new 
musical territory: "The stuff I'm writing now is edgier and a little more 
biting. It moves away from the country rock to more folk-blues rock" in the 
vein of the late Stevie Ray Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Pyzow continues working diligently at his other roles in his 
band, as manager and promoter. So far, he has attracted only nibbles from the 
record companies. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not a guy who put a band together to get a record deal," says Pyzow, 
whose band returns to Orange County to play the White House in Laguna Beach on 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at it as a big goal. I do what I do and many things happen along 
the way, but I'm not necessarily striving for the 'big break.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, he adds, "it would be wonderful to be at a bigger acceptance level and 
play before 3,000 or 4,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
The Tearjerkers' next move, meanwhile, is shopping for a producer to record 
their first album, band members said before performing Wednesday at Peppers 
Golden Bear. (Related story, F3.) 
</P>
<P>
The band has recorded a handful of singles and written a slew more. But, after 
two years of "just playing whatever we felt like," the group has since carved 
out a clear musical direction, guitarist/vocalist Celsi says. 
</P>
<P>
The Tearjerkers' original glossy pop sound has since developed ragged edges. 
Band members say that came about a year ago, when Cynthia Jones replaced 
Allison MacLeod, who had been the group's primary lead vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
Lead guitarist Bruce Kaplan, half-jokingly, sums up the band's current sound as 
"the Everly Sisters meets Van Halen." 
</P>
<P>
Jones has helped bring more of an R&amp;B flavor to the Tearjerkers in place of 
the country hue that was characterized by MacLeod's Maria McKee-like vocals. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the group's sound centers around the harmonic intertwining of three 
female voices: Jones, Celsi and bassist/co-songwriter Danette Christine. 
Blended with ringing guitars, the result can easily be labeled as L.A.'s latest 
"girl group" pop sound. 
</P>
<P>
But, although band members acknowledge the influence of bands from the Ronettes 
to the Bangles, they prefer to play down "the G-word" factor, as they put it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't necessarily have girl-group sensibilities, but we may have a 
girl-group sound," Celsi says. But she and her band mates disagree with 
often-cited comparisons to the Bangles. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bangles and the Go-Go's opened a lot of doors, but I don't think we sound 
anything like them," Celsi says. "We're as much like the Bangles as the Stones 
were the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
And, as drummer Mark Wagner adds, "we're not all girls." 
</P>
<P>
The female majority is "integral to the chemistry of the group," Christine 
says, but "we're more a family than a group of girls." 
</P>
<P>
The Tearjerkers' quest to record their first album, they say, is still in the 
early stages. They have gotten some airplay on KROQ's Rodney Bingenheimer's 
program and KLOS's late-night show featuring local music, but a record deal 
still appears well down the road, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"The best we can do is play gigs and sound good," Kaplan says. 
</P>
<P>
And they hope that Bingenheimer's affinity for female vocal-based pop bands may 
lead to a break. 
</P>
<P>
"We first tried to meet Rodney at the station, but they wouldn't let us in," 
Celsi says. "So we followed him to Pennyfeathers, his favorite restaurant, and 
forced our record on him. And he liked it." 
</P>
<P>
But, Rodney being Rodney, she says, "all he wanted to talk about was the 
Bangles." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tearjerkers play Saturday at midnight at the Bohemian Cafe at Bogart's, 
6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway in the Marina Pacifica Mall, Long Beach. 
Admission: $5. Information: (213) 594-8976.

 The Nick Pyzow Band plays at 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday at the White House,

NEWSWIRE: THREE QUESTIONED IN PHILLIPS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in San Diego questioned but did not arrest three construction workers 
Friday in connection with an attack on Charger nose tackle Joe Phillips outside 
a Mission Beach restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The men voluntarily submitted to questioning for about 30 minutes each before 
being released, Sgt. Pete Munholand said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, all San Diego residents, were not arrested because they are 
cooperating with investigators and are not likely to leave town, Munholand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was released Friday from Sharp Memorial Hospital after suffering a 
concussion, a broken bone around his eye, a broken nose, cuts and bruises in 
the attack. In a statement, he offered for the first time his account of the 
incident, which occurred early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said that after he and an unidentified woman left Saska's restaurant 
on Mission Boulevard, a car pulled up as they walked, and words were exchanged 
between men in the car and the woman. The men then got out, Phillips said, 
began yelling and pushed the woman to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Phillips said, two of the men came at him and he was hit in the 
back of the head and fell. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I remember is looking up, seeing the girl being held by at 
least one of them," Phillips said. "And then I remember getting kicked, and 
then I went out. The next thing I remember is walking up to the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was saying was, 'Come on, let's get in the car and get out of here.' I 
wasn't interested in fighting at all. I'd never seen them before. . . . It was 
completely unprovoked." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is expected to be out of the Chargers' lineup for eight weeks.

SPORTS CENTER BRINGS WARMTH TO SIBERIA; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: IN THE TOWN OF BILIBINO, THERE IS LITTLE ELSE TO SERVE AS A 
DIVERSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BILIBINO, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sports center on Lenin Square is the most popular place in town in this 
faraway place on top of the world, site of the only nuclear power station above 
the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody comes to the sports center to get movement in their bodies, to play 
the games, to escape miserable weather and boredom of day-to-day living," said 
Tamara Bezrodnaya, 51, director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
Siberia has some of the world's worst weather. And Bilibino, in the Soviet 
Union's northeastern corner, is no exception. The town is 100 miles north of 
the Arctic Circle, 100 miles south of the East Siberian Sea and the Arctic 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures are frequently 50 to 80 degrees below zero from November through 
March, when there is darkness 20 to 24 hours a day. Bone-numbing Siberian winds 
off the Arctic Ocean drop the windchill factor to more than 100 degrees below 
zero. Snow averages three to six feet nine months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Schools close, factories shut down and shopkeepers lock their doors when the 
thermometer dips to 50 below. Those who work outdoors in the extreme cold are 
bundled up head to toe, their faces hidden by woolen masks with eye slits. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country and downhill skiing are major sports, but not, of course, when it 
is too cold to be outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Even from April to October, when there is sunlight 20 to 24 hours a day, the 
weather is unpleasant in Bilibino nearly all the time because of dense fog or 
low-hanging cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
"We count the number of sunny days in a year in Bilibino on the fingers of our 
two hands," Bezrodnaya said. "Oh yes, and in summer we have the giant 
mosquitoes and huge horseflies. That is why the sports center is so popular 
with every man, woman and child in Bilibino (population 16,000). They come here 
for something to do, to exercise, to compete in sports, to try to forget the 
awful weather." 
</P>
<P>
Sports centers are found in every city or town of any size in the Soviet Union. 
The center in Bilibino, however, is larger, better equipped and better 
maintained than most. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1981 at a cost of 1 million rubles -- $167,000 -- the center was 
erected and is operated by the Bilibino nuclear power station. 
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear power station is rich," Bezrodnaya said. "That's why it could 
afford a facility of this quality." 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power station workers and their families use the center without charge. 
Others pay a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
The sports center is a four-story beige structure on Lenin Square in the heart 
of Bilibino. Also on the square are the post office, museum, cultural club, 
cinema, hotel and a few shops, although they have hardly anything for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"You do know the Soviet government's main purpose in building sports centers 
throughout our country is to keep our people physically fit, free of disease 
and illness, to enable them to work year-round without sick leaves," Bezrodnaya 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sports centers are especially important for people living in Siberia, he added, 
"because we are confined to our flats and workplaces due to the miserable 
weather. It is necessary to get out and get some movement in our bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"In winter it is too cold, too icy and snowy, in summer too rainy and foggy for 
outdoor sports, so, everyone comes to the sports center. Of course there are 
some who sit at home and watch television hours on end and others who drink 
themselves into stupors. But we encourage everyone to come to the sports center 
for health of mind and body." 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in an Olympic-size pool, basketball, volleyball, boxing, wrestling, 
gymnastics and exercise classes are the main activities at the sports center, 
which is open from 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. seven days a week. A men's basketball 
league, with eight teams, and a women's league, with five teams, play in the 
center's two gymnasiums. There are 16 on the center's staff. 
</P>
<P>
Chukchis and Eveni, Siberian natives similar to Alaska's Eskimos, live in the 
Bilibino area and use the center. The native men are especially adept at two 
sports, wrestling and lassoing, an activity that grew out of their work as 
reindeer herders. 
</P>
<P>
To brighten up the otherwise drab existence here, the center's gymnasiums, 
swimming pool and other rooms are painted with colorful murals. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the swimming pool are rows of hair dryers for swimmers to use before 
going into the freezing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
There are four schools in Bilibino, Grades 1 through 11. Until last year, 
Soviet students went through 10 grades. The nation's minister of education 
decided to add another year. In this small city, because of a shortage of 
classrooms, schools operate on two shifts, half the students attending from 8 
a.m. to 2 p.m., the others from 2 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Three days a week, each student goes to the sports center for physical 
education. Schools also have sports programs. Each class has basketball and 
volleyball teams that play against the same levels of classes in the other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Why would people live in such a remote, unpleasant place eight time zones east 
of Moscow? In the past, the government forced people to move here, whether they 
wanted to or not. Today they come here from every republic in the country 
because of the high wages. 
</P>
<P>
Bilibino is in the heart of a rich gold- and coal-mining district. The nuclear 
power station, completed in 1974, was a well-kept secret from the outside world 
until recently. 
</P>
<P>
Workers here are paid three times what they are in Moscow to compensate for the 
remoteness of the area and the severity of the weather. It is inaccessible by 
car or rail. The only way to Bilibino is by airplane or helicopter. Wages are 
even higher for nuclear station workers because of the risks involved in 
connection with their jobs. The station is similar to the one at Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
An above-the-ground complex of large pipes snakes through the valley leading 
from the nuclear power plant five miles from Bilibino, carrying warm water from 
the nuclear facility to supply the needs of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors have two concerns. Concrete and mortar crumble from the exterior and 
interior of all structures, including the sports center -- where there are huge 
cracks in the exterior and plaster falling from the walls and ceilings inside. 
Shoddy construction is evident everywhere. So how safe can the nuclear station 
be? 
</P>
<P>
Bilibino is backed up against a mountain. If there should be an accident at the 
nuclear power plant, the only escape would be via an evacuation route that 
leads past the nuclear plant to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone lives in tiny flats in huge concrete apartment complexes, four to 
seven stories high without elevators. Entire families share one small bedroom, 
a small living room, a small kitchen and a small bathroom. Many newcomers live 
in one-room apartments, sharing a bathroom and a kitchen down the hall with 
four other families. They are waiting for new flats to be built. 
</P>
<P>
The national Day of Sports was celebrated in Bilibino Aug. 11, as it was 
throughout the Soviet Union. It's a day when sports and athletes are honored. 
</P>
<P>
There was a huge parade through Bilibino as teams, wearing jerseys and 
uniforms, marched in columns -- men, women and children. On a day of 
competition, there was even a firefighters' race to see which company could put 
out a staged fire the quickest. There were games between military units. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the KGB fielded a team, Bezrodnaya laughed and said: "Such people do 
not have sports teams that we know of. If they do, it is a big secret. 
Everything the KGB does is a big secret." 
</P>
<P>
Individuals and teams were awarded trophies, samovars, crystal, plates and 
certificates for championship performances during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Vescheslaw Afonin, 44, is head master for children's sports at the sports 
center. He came here 11 years ago from Kaluga, near Moscow. He is a master 
wrestler in the lightweight division. 
</P>
<P>
"Wrestling is popular throughout the U.S.S.R," he said. "Here in Bilibino, we 
average 1,000 or more spectators for our wrestling matches." 
</P>
<P>
Bezrodnaya's husband is also a master wrestler. Tamara, from the Ukraine, was a 
bicycle racer for 10 years in her native republic. She and her husband have two 
children and a grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
Many women in the Soviet Union are directors of sports centers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a job that doesn't pay all that well," Bezrodnaya said. "That's why it 
attracts more women than men. Even here in Bilibino, where wages are three 
times what they are in Moscow and even more than that for nuclear station 
workers, I receive only 500 rubles ($83) a month." 
</P>
<P>
But her job is one of the most important in Bilibino because she is responsible 
for providing an escape from drudgery for all the people in this little-known 
Siberian town on top of the world.

Activated Monday after his two-week roster exemption expired, safety Vann 
McElroy is eligible to play in Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll use him if there's an opportunity where we have to use him," Coach Art 
Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
"But he'll help us on special teams." 
</P>
<P>
McElroy could also play in the Raiders' nickel pass coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Raider nose guard Bob Golic and his wife, Jackie, are expecting their first 
child Dec. 10, the date of the Raiders' Monday night game against the Lions in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"They said she's probably going to have it early because the kid's pretty big," 
Golic said. "I'd like her to have it on a Wednesday or Thursday, because those 
are our tough (practice) days. With my luck, she'll have it on Tuesday, our day 
off. It's like (with) a kid who gets sick and doesn't have to go to school -- 
but it turns out to be Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders rank 11th in the AFC in total offense but have the conference's 
third-best defense behind Houston and Pittsburgh. The Raiders have given up 25 
points in three games, fewest in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jay Schroeder is the AFC's No. 4 passer with a rating of 88.7, 
better than Boomer Esiason of Cincinnati and John Elway of Denver. CHRIS BAKER

ROZIER COULD BE BACK WITH GLANVILLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Disgruntled running back Mike Rozier wants to join his former coach Jerry 
Glanville in Atlanta, and the Houston Oilers are trying to appease those 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to trade Mike," Oiler General Manager Mike Holovak said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be good for him. He wants to play football and it would be an 
opportunity for him to play." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers are reportedly seeking a conditional draft choice for Rozier, the 
1983 Heisman Trophy winner from Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston chapter of the National Organization for Women has called on women 
to avoid buying goods made by Remington Products Inc. after an alleged locker 
room incident involving players and a female reporter and the reactions of team 
officials, including owner Victor Kiam, who also owns Remington. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Olson of the Boston Herald said she was harassed by Zeke Mowatt and other 
players as she conducted an interview Sept. 17, a practice day. 
</P>
<P>
Mowatt, in a prepared statement, said that his "religious values and my 
character would never allow me to do or say anything as disrespectful as has 
been reported, to any human being."

RUSHING WON'T COME OUT EVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Curt Warner has been the starter and main Ram rusher for the first three games, 
although he might not be the starter Oct. 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals at 
Anaheim Stadium. If Warner doesn't start, Cleveland Gary will. 
</P>
<P>
So, where does that leave Gaston Green, the third-year third wheel of this Ram 
tailback triumvirate? It's hard to say. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who had an impressive exhibition season after two disappointing seasons 
in a Ram uniform, has carried only 15 times for 65 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's getting caught in the middle somewhere a little bit," Coach John Robinson 
said of Green. "But there's nothing wrong with him. He's going to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make them all come out of each game with 12 1/2 carries. I don't do it 
right all the time. I'm just trying to get the guys in the game and respond to 
the game as it goes. I mean, I don't have an obligation to any one of them to 
give them a certain amount of carries. I've got to try to do the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
With the NFL's recent decision to reinstate practice squads, Robinson says he 
would probably add a running back and either an offensive lineman or a 
defensive lineman if he gets the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Teams must carry a minimum of three first-year or rookie players on the squads, 
and can have a maximum of five. The players earn $3,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie receiver Tony Lomack and rookie tight end Joe Price, who have hamstring 
injuries, must be counted on the squad because they are rookies on injured 
reserve but are practicing with the team. First-year tight end Richard Ashe, 
who was put on injured reserve with a foot problem, is another candidate for 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams worked out three defensive linemen Friday, including Mark Walen, 
formerly of UCLA and the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that the workouts were the evaluations of available talent that a 
team normally does throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
The others worked out were former Detroit defensive end Milford Hodge and 
defensive tackle Gary Hadd, a 1988 draft pick of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Walen, who because of injuries has not played in a pro game, was a third-round 
pick of the Cowboys in 1986, and was released this exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will work out two more defensive linemen today -- 1985 New England 
draft choice Ben Thomas and 1990 New Orleans eighth-round pick Derrick Carr.

BARGAIN HUNTERS HELP STOCKS REVIVE; DOW CLOSES UP 25 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market staged an impressive turnaround Friday after an initial plunge 
in prices lured investors from the sidelines as they hunted for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 25.00 at 2,452.48, having worked 
back from a near 50-point deficit earlier in the day. For the week, the index 
lost 59.90, or 2.4%. The index hit a 16-month low on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market Friday, gaining issues outpaced losers, with 877 up, 693 
down and 408 unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was a 
hefty 201.01 million shares, up from 182.69 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Blue chips tumbled sharply at the opening, falling nearly 50 in the first 
half-hour as investors dumped stocks after steep drops in foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
Traders got another dose of bad news early in the day when the Commerce 
Department reported a steep decline in its main gauge of future economic 
growth. The index of leading indicators dropped 1.2% in August from July. It 
was the steepest drop in three years in the index, designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months in advance. "The level of nervousness 
about the economy was intense this morning," said Hugh Johnson, chief 
investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the figure provided yet another signal that the economy was 
headed for a recession, as oil prices remained near their highest levels in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Oil for November delivery fell 3 cents to $39.51 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange after rising steadily through the week. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks were whipped into a late rally as cheap prices lured buyers. "People are 
really seeing cheap stocks and they're willing to take a bit of a risk," said 
James Schroeder, an analyst with MMS International in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Blue chip issues led the advance, and the broader market joined in shortly 
before the close. "We seem to have gone from capitulation to jubilation all in 
one session," said Eugene Peroni, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Bank stocks, which had been badly bruised since Chase Manhattan announced a 
restructuring, layoffs and a dividend cut last week, helped bolster the market 
as they regained some ground. Citicorp was up 1/2 at 14 1/4, Chase Manhattan 
gained 3/4 to 11 3/4, Bank of Boston was up 3/4 at 7 7/8, BankAmerica was up 1 
at 20 1/4, J.P. Morgan jumped 2 1/8 to 32 7/8 and Chemical Bank was up 1 3/8 at 
15 1/2. Wells Fargo rose 3 to 45 3/4, Security Pacific added 2 7/8 to 22 1/2 
and First Interstate gained 2 5/8 to 22 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* UAL, parent of United Airlines, also moved higher, gaining 6 3/4 to 97 3/8 on 
news that investor Marvin Davis offered to join the employee buyout of the 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
* Ralston Purina, which announced a share buyback plan of up to 2 million of 
its approximately 56 million common shares, rose 3 3/8 to 99 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Computer company Sun Microsystems fell 3 7/8 to 21 7/8. Goldman Sachs cut its 
earnings estimates and downgraded the stock, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
* Among other actively traded Big Board issues, Unisys, which is eliminating 
its dividend, lost 3/8 to 5; General Electric rose 2 7/8 to 54 1/2; Philip 
Morris rose 1 1/4 to 45 1/4; Wal Mart was up 7/8 at 27 1/4, and the Limited 
rose 7/8 to 13 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, British shares dropped but picked up from the day's lows in 
late trading. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 18.9 at 1,990.2. 
</P>
<P>
The badly battered Tokyo stock market fell sharply overnight, with the 
benchmark Nikkei index ending down 788.41 points, or 3.62%, at 20,983.50. 
</P>
<P>
Shares also fell in Frankfurt in nervous trading, still vulnerable to any news 
from the Gulf pointing to a rise in tension. The DAX index of 30 leading shares 
fell 19.19 to 1,334.89, a loss of 111.68 this week, or 7.7%.

Budget Optimism Boosts Bond Prices 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond prices climbed as the market anticipated an imminent agreement on 
the federal budget and traders saw another sign of increasing economic 
weakness. 
</P>

The widely watched 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32 point, or $7.19 for every 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield dropped to 8.94% from 9.02% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders believed congressional negotiators would reach a budget agreement 
by the deadline Sunday night, the end of the 1990 fiscal year, said Terrence 
Doyle, a trader with Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, the bond market has anticipated that a federal budget agreement 
could lead the Federal Reserve to allow interest rates to fall. Lower rates 
benefit fixed-return investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices also were supported by the release of the index of leading 
indicators. The signs of economic weakness raised hopes that the Fed will ease 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, down from 8.063% late Thursday.

Dollar Makes Gains in Slow Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against all major currencies except its Canadian counterpart 
in unusually slow U.S. trading Friday after moving mostly lower overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar traded within a narrow band on domestic and foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
The typically light volume that ordinarily occurs on Fridays was curtailed even 
further by the approaching end to the month, calendar year quarter and half of 
Japan's fiscal year. All three occur Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday, which began at sundown Friday, also 
lightened liquidity because some dealers left work early. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen in New York, rising to 138.50 yen in 
late trading, from 137.98 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound lost ground and was quoted late in the day at $1.8760, down 
from $1.8780 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished at 1.5665 German marks, up from Thursday's close of 1.5610.

Gold Prices Decline After Early Run-Up 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices followed energy prices in an upward spiral but slipped late 
in the day amid signs the government is trying to halt runaway speculation that 
produced a volatile week on the commodity and stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $2.50 to $3.30 on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract 
for delivery in September at $402.50 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, silver and platinum extended their losses; soybean 
futures prices slipped; grains were mixed; livestock futures were mixed and 
pork futures were higher. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum rallied from an opening low on the New York Mercantile Exchange and 
settled $3.70 to $4.20 lower, with October at $433.10 an ounce. Silver settled 
2.5 cents to 1 cent lower on the Commodity Exchange, with October at $4.761 an 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures fell and grains were mixed during a day of thin, quiet trading 
on the Chicago Board of Trade.

AFTER HECTIC DAY, CALM RETURNS TO OIL FUTURES MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Crude oil prices Friday failed to top the record highs of the day before and 
closed practically unchanged in a day of skittish trading marked by a lack of 
news from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for November delivery closed down just 3 cents a barrel from 
Thursday's record close, settling at $39.51 a barrel. Crude oil for later 
months closed slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
The uneventful trading was in sharp contrast with the frenetic buying of the 
day before, when rumors of war drove crude oil prices briefly above $40 a 
barrel for the first time since crude futures began trading on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a quiet day," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus 
Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "There's a reluctance to buy or to 
sell. . . . Many people I've talked with today are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, crude oil prices on the mercantile exchange have gained $4.08 a barrel 
in the last week and more than $18 since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rose at the opening Friday but peaked at $39.95, suggesting resistance 
at the psychological barrier of $40. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people were very cautious and wanted maybe to reduce their exposure a 
little bit going into the weekend, and they didn't want to take on any new 
positions," said James R. Fiedler, a broker with E D &amp; F Man International 
Futures Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Prices then fell as traders took profits, spurred partly by news that the House 
had agreed to triple the proposed 5-million-barrel test drawdown of crude oil 
from the 590-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The low during the 
trading day was $38.65 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The low prices sparked renewed buying, and prices picked up near the close, 
nearly reaching Thursday's level. "With the threat of war out there, people are 
afraid to be too short," said Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy 
Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
One reason: Sunday is the birthday of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed, a likely 
occasion for more harsh words from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, traders paid little attention to President Bush's announcement 
that he would begin tapping the strategic reserve in an effort to cool 
overheated markets. As prices went through the roof that day, Administration 
officials backed off statements that the test drawdown was intended to lower 
oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
But Energy Secretary James D. Watkins let it be known to House leaders that he 
would favor increasing the drawdown to 500,000 barrels a day, and the House 
voted for the change Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the news did not quell fears that war may break out and threaten 
worldwide oil shortages, fears that are keeping oil prices firm, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The International Energy Agency, which met Friday in Paris, did little to allay 
those anxieties: It ruled out following Bush's lead and tapping strategic 
reserves of its 21 industrial country members. 
</P>
<P>
The IEA did, however, ask its members to prepare for emergency drawdowns in the 
event of supply disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, there was little of the paranoia of recent days to drive Friday's 
trading, traders said. "There's end-of-the-week profit taking. There's a real 
lack of any fresh rumors. There's no saber rattling," said Sal Gilbertie, a 
trader with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for unleaded gasoline opened higher but closed lower as traders took 
profits as the month ended. Unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed down 
0.93 of a cent at $1.0176 a gallon. Prices for later months also closed down. 
</P>
<P>
Buying of home heating oil contracts was stronger as fears of winter shortages 
persisted, and home heating oil for October delivery closed up 0.61 cent a 
gallon at $1.0498. Contracts for later months also closed higher, except 
January, which was off a tenth of a cent.

RE-REGULATION OF CABLE TV FAILS, AT LEAST FOR NOW; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE CABLE INDUSTRY KEEPS A BILL FROM THE SENATE FLOOR. SUPPORTERS VOW TO 
TRY AGAIN NEXT YEAR.

Legislation to re-regulate cable television and let the government set basic 
subscriber rates apparently died Friday on the Senate floor after the cable 
industry and its supporters managed to keep the measure from coming to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill said it would have passed easily. They vowed to press 
again next session to impose restrictions over the cable industry, which they 
contend has operated as an unfettered monopoly since being deregulated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But next year, they predicted, the legislation will be more likely to include 
provisions allowing telephone companies to enter the cable TV business. The 
Bush Administration supports that proposal, but the television, publishing and 
cable industries argue that it would lead to telephone company domination over 
the information industries of the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill would have allowed the Federal Communications Commission to set 
prices for the most basic category of cable programming and to review 
complaints over the pricing of premium programming such as Cable News Network, 
Home Box Office and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
A similar bill had already passed the House, and the Senate measure had been 
approved by the Commerce Committee on an 18-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
But a last-minute impasse developed when Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) proposed an 
amendment that would strike language forbidding cable companies from signing 
exclusive contracts for programming. Aides said the amendment had been slipped 
under the door of the committee office, where they found it Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth said he would not agree to any time limits on debating his amendment. 
Sponsors of the bill said they interpreted his remark as an implicit threat of 
a filibuster by Wirth unless his proposed changes were accepted. 
</P>
<P>
To supporters of the bill, it appeared that Wirth was gambling that they were 
so anxious for passage in the waning days of the Congress that they would 
accept the changes rather than see the bill die. Wirth aides denied that, 
attributing the delay in delivery of the amendment to a simple mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth -- whose state is home to Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest 
cable company -- is particularly opposed to the proposed ban on exclusive 
programming contracts by cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that such "exclusivity clauses" have hampered the development of 
emerging television technologies, such as satellite and wireless cable. Cable 
companies argue that offering exclusive programming long has been a hallmark of 
the television business, citing the major networks as an example. 
</P>
<P>
After Wirth's action raised the specter of a filibuster, the bill's sponsors, 
Sens. John Danforth (R-Mo.) and Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), were so angry that 
they declared the bill "dead and buried," aides said. 
</P>
<P>
"As for now, the cable companies have won, and they get to keep their 
unregulated monopolies and increase the cost of service and allow the quality 
of service to deteriorate," Danforth said. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the cable industry was careful to not create the impression that it 
killed the bill. "The National Cable Television Assn. remains prepared to 
participate in the legislative process to work out a reasonable cable bill," 
spokesman John Wolfe said in a brief statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration opposed the bill because it includes rate reregulation 
and because it does not allow phone company entry into the industry, which the 
White House argues is the best way to encourage competition.

PLUNGING NIKKEI SIGNALS SHIFT TO CASH ECONOMY 
</P>

<P>
By custom, it should have been a great week for the Tokyo stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the halfway point in the Japanese fiscal year, the day corporations 
must use to value their stock holdings. For weeks, brokers had been boasting 
about how prices would climb as their sales forces, in an effort to please 
their corporate clients, drummed up new buyers and pushed up share prices. 
</P>
<P>
This practice of ramping up prices to serve corporate interests is so common at 
this time of year that one Daiwa Securities trader bravely predicted last week 
that the Nikkei 225-stock index would climb more than 10% to 26,000 in the 
final week of September. 
</P>
<P>
No such luck. Even an army of brokers couldn't turn the tide. Instead, pummeled 
by high interest rates, soaring oil prices and weakening land prices, the 
Nikkei fell 2,794 for the week, crashing through the 21,000 mark seen by many 
as an important support level to close Friday at 20,983.50. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of war in Iraq temporarily brought the market down even more sharply on 
Friday before institutional investors came in to stage a minor rally. 
</P>
<P>
With the market already down 46% from its high of 38,915 late last year, few 
expect to see another crash. But analysts say another 20% drop during the 
coming months is not inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
The price drop represents not merely an adjustment in what had been an inflated 
market but a major structural change in Japan's financial markets, many 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since World War II, stock market declines of 40% have only happened four 
times. Each time represented a period of structural change," said a senior 
executive of one major Japanese brokerage who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
The latest drop brought an end to a four-year period in which the entire 
economy focused on the value of assets rather than on income, he said. In words 
that have become a cliche in Japan, he called the latest structural change a 
switch from focusing on "stock" to looking at "flow," meaning cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Driven by a sharp appreciation of the yen at the end of 1985 and the drop in 
oil prices, interest rates fell. That, in turn, fueled speculation in land. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices also shot up, with investors focusing not so much on earnings as 
on a company's "hidden assets" -- usually premium land not reflected on the 
company's balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
With a focus on assets rather than earnings, stock prices rapidly outpaced 
economic and earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the total value of the roughly 1,300 Japanese stocks traded in the 
first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange was about one-third of the nation's total 
economic output, or gross national product. By 1989, the stocks were worth 
$4.44 trillion, 1 1/2 times the nation's total GNP. The ratio paralleled that 
seen on Wall Street before the 1929 crash. Price-to-earnings ratios reached 60, 
four times U.S. levels. 
</P>
<P>
This inflation in asset prices allowed Japanese corporations and individuals to 
borrow huge sums which they then reinvested, again driving up prices and 
leaving the country awash in cash. 
</P>
<P>
All that has changed. The forces that were driving stocks in an upward spiral 
until last year have been turned on their heads. Now those forces are pushing 
prices into a downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
High interest rates have made it more costly for investors to hold land and 
stocks that produce little income. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are being forced to cut their lending as their capital base, made up 
largely of land and stocks, has shrunk in value. Some analysts worry that a 
credit crunch could eventually force some borrowers into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see the bankruptcy of some large-sized companies, it could even trigger 
a panic," said Josen Takahashi, chief researcher at Mitsubishi Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"If property prices come down too fast, it could bring the whole system down," 
said Taek Chong, general manager of Schroder Securities Ltd.'s Tokyo office. 
</P>
<P>
Even the best-case scenario sees a sluggish market during the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
High-priced oil, meanwhile, is driving up interest rates and cutting into 
corporate earnings. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, higher oil prices have 
cost corporate Japan $29 billion beyond its normal oil bill, according to 
financial analyst Akimoto Kogiso. 
</P>
<P>
With long-term bonds in Japan yielding 8.2%, money is leaving stocks and going 
into bonds. 
</P>
<P>
At current interest rates, the Nikkei index would have to fall to about 18,000 
before stocks would be attractive again, one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, shares would sell for about 25 times earnings. They would still 
get a 100% premium compared to U.S. stocks, but Tokyo analysts say that is 
justified by the competitiveness of Japan's firms and the strength of its 
economy relative to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
The optimists aren't giving in. Since the U.S. Federal Reserve Board eventually 
will be forced to ease U.S. interest rates to revive the economy, they have 
argued, the differential between U.S. and Japanese interest rates will 
eventually disappear. That will draw money back into Japan, driving interest 
rates down. Once Japanese long-term bonds again yield about 6.5%, Tokyo stocks 
will take on a new shine. 
</P>
<P>
But even the greatest optimists admit that could take a long time. And for all 
the talk about patient investing, Japanese investors don't appear ready to wait 
it out.

Mortgage Rates Rise: Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.22% this week, up from 
10.16% last week, according to a national survey released by the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp. It was the highest rate since fixed-rate mortgages averaged 
10.24% on Aug. 31. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking 
an average initial rate of 8.28%, down from 8.30% last week. The rates do not 
include add-on fees known as points.

Domestic Air Fares to Rise 4.2%: The fares are being hiked to cover higher fuel 
costs, but travel agents reported only a slight increase in ticket sales before 
the increases begin on Monday. A more substantial fare jump last month prompted 
not only record ticket sales but record-breaking headaches for travel agents. 
The unprecedented sales volume overloaded computer reservation systems, causing 
them to stall, or, in some cases, temporarily shut down.

Newspaper Guild Authorizes Strike: A union representing about 1,200 San 
Francisco newspaper workers unanimously authorized a strike if contract talks 
fail to forge an agreement soon. "We've been bargaining since last February, 
and our members are increasingly upset that no contract has been reached yet," 
said Bernie Beck of the Northern California Newspaper Guild's unit at the San 
Francisco Chronicle. No deadline for completion of contract talks had been set.

JURY AWARDS $26 MILLION TO SAN DIEGO FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. District Court jury in San Diego has recommended that Sunnyvale-based 
Advanced Micro Devices pay $26 million in damages to San Diego-based Brooktree 
for infringing on three Brooktree patents that cover computer chips used to 
generate color graphics on computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William Enright on Thursday prohibited AMD from making, 
using or selling any products that infringe on the patents. 
</P>
<P>
Enright also gave AMD 10 days to appeal the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys described the case as the first test of the Semiconductor Chip 
Protection Act of 1984, which is designed to protect technological advances in 
the hotly competitive computer chip industry. The same federal jury on Sept. 10 
determined that AMD had violated Brooktree's patent rights for the chips. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, AMD Chairman and Chief Executive W. J. Sanders III 
said AMD would comply with the order, pending an appeal. "We are aghast at the 
implications of the verdict," Sanders said. "If the jury verdict and damages 
are confirmed by the court and not overturned on appeal, a gross miscarriage of 
justice will have been done." 
</P>
<P>
The closely watched court case focused on patents covering microchips that are 
known as color palettes. They are used to control the display of colors on 
computer monitor screens. Industry analysts have set the fast-growing market 
for color palettes at about $70 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which dates to November, 1988, pitted privately held Brooktree, which 
expects to report about $60 million in revenue during 1990, against AMD, a 
giant chip maker with more than $1.2 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
The award covers three Brooktree patents that are used in graphics applications 
in engineering workstations and high-resolution personal computers, according 
to Brooktree spokeswoman Cathy Batchelor.

Literacy program -- A Sept. 3 article about a literacy program at the Acton 
Rehabilitation Center incorrectly reported that Gary Sapp, a resident at the 
center, had been unable to read after spending four years as a football player 
and student at the University of Houston. Academic officials and coaches at the 
university say Sapp was never a student or football player there. The article 
also incorrectly stated that Sapp had played on three National Football League 
teams.

RECYCLING CENTERS IN CENTRAL LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those old boxes, oil cans, magazines and newspapers that have been building up 
in your garage are recyclable. The state Integrated Waste Management Board has 
released the following list of Central Los Angeles recycling centers that 
accept an array of disposable products. Listings for other Los Angeles County 
communities will appear this Sunday in suburban sections and the San Fernando 
Valley Edition. A listing for the Glendale area will appear in Thursday's 
Glendale section. The board has a toll-free hot line for recycling information: 
(800) 553-2962. The line is often busy and does not provide information about 
prices paid for recylables. Local centers -- with phone numbers listed below -- 
provide that information. This list differs from ones previously published in 
The Times that featured centers certified by the state to pay for beverage 
containers.
