METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE HAIL WEEKEND WITH 'THE HAMMER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An extra 200 police officers swept through the heart of Los Angeles Friday 
night in a weekend crackdown on gang members and their illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from five police divisions in East Los Angeles, Mid City and the 
northeast area hit the streets at 6 p.m., Officer Monique Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
The Friday night sweep and a similar sweep scheduled for tonight were to last 
until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Newton, Central, Hollenbeck, Northeast and Rampart divisions 
made up the task force. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, christened "The Hammer" when it was introduced in January, 
1988, by Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, was to focus on central neighborhoods 
where recent statistics showed a 100% increase in gang-related slayings and a 
general upswing in gang crime, Sgt. Larry Masur said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 SENTENCED IN PLAN TO LOOT ATMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five people were sentenced in U.S. District Court Friday on conspiracy and 
counterfeiting charges stemming from an ambitious scheme to loot perhaps 
millions of dollars from automated teller machines during a three-day holiday 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the five manufactured thousands of bogus automated teller cards 
using information stolen from Bank of America. Mark Koenig, 28, of Los Angeles, 
was sentenced in Los Angeles to 41 months in prison. He pleaded guilty in May 
to a count of conspiracy and five counts of producing and using counterfeit 
automated teller cards. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hussey, 28, of Marina del Rey, was sentenced to 30 months in prison on 
the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig's wife, Jacklyn Bobby, 33, received 30 months in prison for conspiracy 
and two counts of counterfeiting. Her sister, Bobbi Jo Bobby, 20, of Ladera 
Heights, was sentenced to 21 months on one charge each of counterfeiting and 
conspiracy. Scott Koenig, 27, of Lincoln, Neb., Mark Koenig's brother, was 
sentenced to 18 months for a single charge of conspiracy.

Photo, Embellished Dome -- On scaffolding 100 feet above the congregation, 
Bishop Anthony of San Francisco, spiritual leader for Greek Orthodox Christians 
in western states, last Sunday blessed 24 mosaics adorning the huge dome in St. 
Sophia Cathedral in Los Angeles. The $300,000 project depicts a "Procession of 
Saints" created by artist Sirio Tonelli. The Byzantine-style mosaics were 
placed between existing stained-glass windows on the interior wall of the dome. 
Cathedral trustees decided on the project, funded entirely from private 
donations, after noticing that painted figures on the dome wall tended to peel 
because of moisture seepage. Above, image of Christ is flanked by archangels; 
at right, detail of Christ figure. BRIAN GADBERY

DISRESPECT FOR LAWYERS AND THE COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of us do not love to hate lawyers -- but two years of being either ignored 
or over-charged by some of Southern California's finest attorneys turned my 
former admiration to the proverbial ashes and dust in my mouth. 
</P>
<P>
To be told by more than one, "It does not pay me to take a case only involving 
$7,000" only becomes understandable when one remembers the hourly charges as 
shown in a recent Times article. Most of the local attorneys charge more per 
hour than I can earn in one day. It takes me a very long time to save up $7,000 
let alone the sanctions ordered by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
As a widow still unable to work full-time, I am falling so far behind in my 
debts that there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. What seems left 
is either bankruptcy or suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The legal system is set up by attorneys -- but if one is too rich for charity 
and too poor to pay an attorney, there is no place left to turn. My husband was 
a World War II veteran with five medals. He never used one red cent of his 
veterans benefits -- but his widow cannot find anyone in the legal system to 
help.

SONGWRITER IRVING BERLIN DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than three years, I have made weekly visits to a special care unit for 
victims of Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders with my mother, who is 
in her 80s and perhaps a bit senior to the average patient. One day, about two 
years ago, my mother discovered that singing old songs like "School Days" and 
patriotic songs was one activity many of the patients enjoyed and could join 
in. 
</P>
<P>
We began to hold informal sing-alongs and to expand our repertoire. Apart from 
gaining an appreciation for Berlin's prolific talent and his legacy of melodic 
tunes and witty lyrics, we came to recognize "Always" as being at the top of 
the hit parade among our memory-impaired friends. It is a song that must have 
been sung at a lot of proms, weddings and anniversaries over the years. It is 
still deep in the hearts of many. More than once, I have seen animation creep 
into a long-mute and expressionless face as a mouth silently formed the words 
"I'll be loving you always."

<TEXT>
<P>
We can obviously tell that Hay is not a lawyer. Look at the way he tries to 
defend them. He doesn't even once mention anything about lawyers representing 
criminals. I guess the only lawyers he knows handle small claims. He makes 
lawyers sound like saints and that the world would fall apart if we didn't have 
them. Come, come. 
</P>
<P>
Who helps to free murderers? Lawyers. Who puts child molesters back on the 
street? Lawyers. Who helps drug dealers get back to their crack houses before 
they miss their next customer? Lawyers. So are lawyers getting a bad rap? I 
don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
Although I am currently incarcerated, I can express my opinion from first-hand 
dealings with lawyers. Many a lawyer has gotten me off even though I was 
guilty. Although my crimes have never been violent or heinous, just the fact 
that my lawyers got me off when I was so obviously guilty makes one ponder. If 
they can do it for a forger, they can do it for anyone.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hay's column eulogizes lawyers without revealing the ways they are now 
burdening society. 
</P>
<P>
Along with their brothers in the legislatures, lawyers and judges have been 
subtle co-conspirators in guaranteeing that the legal role shall be a larger 
than necessary one, with benefits shared greedily. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers, having virtual control of government (where laws and regulations are 
written en masse) and the courts, have created both a self-serving maze and an 
operational monopoly so costly and time-consuming that they deserve the 
disrespect we show them. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone should visit the courts and see the travesty that exists: 
inefficiency, delays and postponements, callousness as to costs and time 
imposed on litigants, and built-in procedures beneficial to lawyers' incomes at 
others' expense. 
</P>
<P>
If they were as good for society as Hay claims, why don't lawyers streamline 
the entire legal process and relinquish minor procedures that can easily be 
handled by anyone or, in more complicated matters, by paralegals? The answer, 
of course, is that they would sacrifice income.

SONGWRITER IRVING BERLIN DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Music, real music, is the perfect alternate life style to the death style of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
When John F. Kennedy was assassinated, it was music that helped bring America 
back from deep depression, fear and a sense of hopelessness. Today we're being 
murdered by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Berlin is dead. So is Beethoven, Brahms and Benny Goodman. They're all 
in heaven because of their music. And we're in heaven when we listen to what 
they left us. Their music can change the world for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Let's pass along the beautiful, inspiring news to our children and our 
grandchildren regarding the golden treasure that Berlin and other musical 
geniuses created for us to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
This can be done by demanding that music appreciation classes be returned to 
our schools. To do so will bring immediate happiness, hope and courage to 
thousands. What better way to honor Berlin?

SONGWRITER IRVING BERLIN DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("America's Music Master," Sept. 26) on the passing away of 
Irving Berlin brought to mind an episode that happened while I was an American 
military prisoner-of-war in Germany in February, 1945. Wounded and then 
captured in the Battle of the Bulge, my spirits were very low because of a lack 
of regular food and the depressing influences of the war. While walking toward 
the main gate, I suddenly heard the German loudspeaker system play a wonderful 
and marvelous recording of the late Bing Crosby singing Irving Berlin's "Blue 
Skies." 
</P>
<P>
When I heard the song, my low spirits picked up; I determined then and there to 
overcome any obstacles and to make it through to the end. Forty-four years 
later, I still marvel at Berlin's wonderful songs and in particular that one 
significant song that carried me through that crisis and a safe return to this 
choice and free land.

Irving Berlin gone at 101 in autumn's first days -- and he was much more than a 
"falling leaf" to me (Part I, Sept. 23). In 1943, when he was doing "This Is 
the Army" at the Palladium in London, I had to handle the press covering the 
matinee command performance before King George VI, his queen, and the two 
princesses. When in his plaintive voice, he asked the audience if they had any 
requests, there was an almost synchronized roar: "Alexander! Alexander's 
Ragtime Band." Berlin looked up at the royal box and King George smiled and 
nodded, and "Alexander" he did one more time. 
</P>
<P>
He was an insomniac, and several of us used to walk with him at night in 
London's blacked-out early mornings -- and listen to his stories. My wife, 
Vada, one of the original WACs, was then with the 12th Air Force in Foggia, in 
Italy, and the USO had Berlin scheduled to visit that Mediterranean theater of 
operations. He jotted down her platoon, saw to it that that small unit was 
added to his itinerary, and none was more surprised than WAC T-5 Corporal Vada 
M. Oldfield, when she was summoned to sit on his right at the platoon's 
mess-hall table when he visited her unit! 
</P>
<P>
Nobody ever spent 101 years better than he did, and because of his enormous 
musical catalogue, that creative time among us will extend into infinity.

FALLOUT FROM L.A. TEACHER PAY RAISES IN AREA SCHOOL DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Sour Fallout From L.A. Teachers' Bonanza," by Melanie Lomax and 
Ted Kimbrough, Op-Ed Page, Sept. 15: 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough and Lomax blamed the problems in Compton on the United Teachers-Los 
Angeles/L.A. Unified School District strike settlement last May. They claimed 
that LAUSD was forced to make program cuts because of the teachers' raise. The 
fact is no cuts have been made. For the last five years LAUSD's general fund 
budget has averaged a yearly surplus of $200 million. Despite last year's 8% 
raise, the general fund surplus for 1988-1989 will probably exceed $200 million 
again. To put those surpluses in perspective, a 1% raise for teachers last year 
cost $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough decries the financial plight of LAUSD because of last year's contract 
settlement and how that settlement in hurting kids. But this year's LAUSD 
budget has 55 administrators paid $100,000 to $161,000; 29 administrators are 
paid from $92,189 to $99,990; over 600 are paid $73,862 to $84,894. Many of 
these administrators are also provided new cars at no cost to them; over 50 are 
provided chauffeurs' services, some full time. If there is anything in the 
LAUSD budget that is denying kids, it is this outrageous, bloated, and overpaid 
administrative staff. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough claims there have been staff reductions in LAUSD. The truth is that 
there are several hundred more teachers employed this year than last. He talks 
about the adverse impact and the impending disaster that face districts around 
Los Angeles. It is not the strike settlement in Los Angeles that is creating 
problems for Kimbrough and the Compton School District. It is their priorities. 
Kimbrough, with a salary in excess of $90,000, is one of the highest paid 
superintendents in the 43 school districts in the county, while Compton 
teachers are among the very lowest paid in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiated contracts that give teachers a decent salary are not the problem of 
public education. The problems lie with the fact that California only gives the 
schools $4,000 per year, per student, while New York funds its schools at 
$7,000 per student, per year. The problem is then compounded by the fact that 
local boards and superintendents like Kimbrough make themselves, their cars and 
their administrative staff the top budget priorities, rather than kids, 
teachers and quality education. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles teachers' strike only helped education by forcing LAUSD to make 
kids and teachers a little higher priority in its $3.8 billion budget. The 
strike also produced the most progressive school-based mangement school reform 
plan in the United States. Teacher organizations like UTLA are working to solve 
the problems of public education that people like Kimbrough want to continue.

NEW YORK YACHT CLUB CRITICIZED FOR APATHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Roberts' article indicated a lack of interest among prospective 
participants in San Diego Yacht Club's defense of the America's Cup. It seems 
strange that the New York Yacht Club and some of the other East Coast 
syndicates are not interested in defending the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Could there be a connection with the New York Yacht Club's court testimony that 
Dennis Conner's defense against New Zealand's monohull with a catamaran was 
unfair? 
</P>
<P>
With all the charges of unsportsmanlike conduct against Conner, it should be 
remembered that he did participate in three Cup defenses for the New York Yacht 
Club. The New York Yacht Club has certainly shown its lack of sportsmanship by 
failing to respond to San Diego's call for participation in a strong American 
defense of the Cup.

A LOGICAL EXPLANATION OF WHY A PITCHER LOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That Orel Hershiser is a great pitcher is a given, but when Hershiser loses a 
game he, the press, the Dodger announcers and Tom Lasorda blame Hershiser's 
teammates for not scoring enough runs for him to win -- isn't that why any 
pitcher loses?

In his column about Michael Chang, Jim Murray remarks that "the world might 
start liking Americans." 
</P>
<P>
A good place to start would be to quit being provincial and start being 
gracious when someone other than an American wins an international tennis 
tournament, even if it is held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we should quit inviting foreigners if they are actually going to win.

A RAIDER MOVE WOULD BENEFIT TV VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It really upsets me that some Ram home games will not be seen on TV, even if 
the Rams sell out 72 hours before game time. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? Because we are forced to see an away Raider game. I hope the 
schedule-makers think about what they are doing before they make this mistake 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Another good solution would be for the Raiders to move.

CHEERING IS ONE THING, DELIBERATE NOISE ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outcome of a football game should not be determined by mob rule. 
</P>
<P>
Cheering is an integral part of the game, but the deliberate deafening of the 
opposing team is unsportsmanlike conduct of the lowest order. The new 
crowd-noise rule is a good one, it just isn't strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
Something has to be done to quiet the egomaniacs in the stands who seem to 
think that the ticket they bought is a license to kill a drive and to 
eventually kill the game of football.

THOUSAND OAKS STEPS TO FORE, 30-20; 
</P>
<P>
LANCERS RALLY PAST CHANNEL ISLANDS TO BECOME FRONT-RUNNERS IN MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter what, it seemed, Channel Islands High was always there for Thousand 
Oaks -- on the horizon, lurking, plotting, waiting and matching win for win. 
</P>
<P>
In seasons of the recent past, Thousand Oaks' and Channel Islands' football 
teams have met later in the season, when the air is cooler and the Marmonte 
League race is much, much hotter. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, however, the preseason favorites to finish 1-2 played in the 
league opener at Thousand Oaks High, and fullback Chris Foster scored three 
second-half touchdowns to lead the Lancers to a 30-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year," Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards said, "as we were winning we were 
checking to see how Channel Islands did each week. At this point, it would have 
been very demoralizing to lose this game." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Channel Islands won the match-up to forge a co-championship with 
the Lancers. The year before, Thousand Oaks won, but Channel Islands captured 
the title outright. The title, it seems, always hangs in the balance when the 
two play. 
</P>
<P>
It might again this year, but it will be savored in hindsight. Both teams have 
five league games to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad we lost the game but I don't feel bad about the way we played 
tonight," Channel Islands Coach Joel Gershon said. "Before it's over, we'll be 
heard from." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands' offense -- especially its passing game -- was loud and clear 
from the start. Quarterback Mark Contreras, who had completed 18 of 41 passes 
for 353 yards in three previous games, was seven of 12 against the Lancers for 
167 yards and three touchdowns -- two to returning all-league receiver Shawn 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
"I coach the defensive secondary, and, boy, that guy did a heck of a job this 
week," Richards said, laughing. "Nobody better offer me toast tomorrow 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
Young's second scoring reception was one of 40 yards, eight seconds into the 
fourth quarter, that gave Channel Islands a 20-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, however, fired back. Despite not completing a pass in the game, 
the Lancers were able to control the tempo via their ground game. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, who with 6:48 left in the third quarter scored from two yards, scored 
again on Thousand Oaks' next possession after Young's touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
His four-yard blast over right guard completed a six-play, 66-yard drive that 
gave the Lancers a 23-20 lead with 9:08 to play. The key play was a 39-yard 
reverse by wide receiver Jim Magallanes. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Ronnie Cruz intercepted a Contreras pass, Thousand Oaks added its 
final touchdown when Foster plunged in from the one with 5:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to move the ball consistently in the first two quarters, Thousand Oaks 
turned to its special teams for a lift. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after Young's 46-yard touchdown reception made the score 14-3 with 22 
seconds left in the first half, Cruz dashed 83 yards with the kickoff for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz broke through the middle of the wedge at the Thousand Oaks 40-yard line 
before cutting left and outrunning the Raiders the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think we got down when they made a couple of big plays and we rose to 
the occasion," Cruz said. "We could've done it all game. It took us a little 
while to get going." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers opened the game with a 57-yard drive that appeared to be sending a 
message to Channel Islands. Mike Lindsay carried six times for 47 yards as 
Thousand Oaks moved to the Raiders' five-yard line before bogging down. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Ybarra's subsequent 22-yard field goal gave the Lancers a 3-0 lead.

WESTERVELT, BLACKWELL CUT LOOSE IN HART ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seemed to hurt Mike Herrington more than it did Dick Flaherty. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington, Hart High's first-year coach, was almost apologetic after his team 
trounced Flaherty's Saugus Centurions, 56-14, in a nonleague game Friday night 
at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very uncomfortable to win this way," Herrington said. "Especially against 
someone I respect as much as Dick Flaherty. But even when we were up, we didn't 
want to stop and have a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty, however, was understandably bruised by the beating. "We were pretty 
much embarrassed," he said. "They dominated every phase of the game. They got 
their speed loose right away." 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty knew that in order for Saugus (2-2) to win, he would have to devise a 
plan to stop senior quarterback Rob Westervelt and contain multithreat tailback 
Howard Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
He probably would have had more luck trying to sell Zsa Zsa Gabor a pair of 
tickets to the Policemen's Ball. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (3-1) bolted to a 42-0 second-quarter lead on the strength of four 
touchdown passes by Westervelt and two touchdowns by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt completed five of 10 passes for 205 yards. There was no need for 
more. Leading, 42-6, at halftime, Hart did not attempt a pass in the second 
half and Westervelt spent the entire fourth quarter on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected 48-0," Westervelt said. "We knew they were going to try and blitz 
and we picked it up real well." 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell scored Hart's first three touchdowns on receptions of 50, 58 and 80 
yards. Hart marched 60 yards in 11 plays on its first possession of the third 
quarter. Blackwell, who rushed for a game-high 81 yards in 12 carries, carried 
10 times on the drive, including the final four yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell, who also spent the final quarter on the bench, finished with three 
receptions for 188 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were sophomores, playing for the Herringtons, we always won big," 
Blackwell said. "It doesn't affect us." 
</P>
<P>
Said Westervelt: "I'm glad everyone got to play." 
</P>
<P>
Hart produced 202 yards rushing -- 186 in the second half. Six reserve running 
backs -- including junior Scott Blanchard, who rushed 92 yards in the third 
quarter for the Indians' final touchdown -- accounted for 127 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus scored its first touchdown on a 38-yard pass from junior quarterback 
Jeff Hickman to wide receiver Pat Henry in the final minute of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Hickman again connected with Henry for a 26-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman completed seven of 23 passes for 160 yards but was sacked five times 
for minus-31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He also threw two interceptions, one of which was returned 43 yards for a 
touchdown by Adam Barlow with two minutes left in the first half. Hart's Andy 
Collins returned a fumble 15 yards for a touchdown one minute earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt and Blackwell teamed to give Hart a 21-0 lead before the game was 
nine minutes old.

PEERY'S RETURN PROVIDES SPARK FOR CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Canyon High offense, which had sputtered during much of September, was 
purring like a kitten against Notre Dame on Friday night, thanks in part to a 
not-so-little addition. 
</P>
<P>
That addition was 214-pound running back Chris Peery, who played his first game 
after undergoing groin surgery before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
Peery, who got clearance to play from his doctor at 4 p.m. Friday and played in 
only the second half, gained 69 yards in 13 carries and scored twice to help 
lift Canyon to its first win of the season, a 45-29 win at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it gives the team more confidence," Peery said of his comeback. 
"It was an all-out effort but I'm a little out of shape." 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys Coach Harry Welch noticed as much. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't move. He's bending over and gasping for air," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
The final four minutes of the game was enough to leave Notre Dame fans in need 
of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:57 to play, Peery scored from the five-yard line to cap a 10-play, 
80-yard drive that used up 5 minutes and 36 seconds of the fourth quarter. 
Chris Wilson, who replaced the injured Steve Mann in the second half, kicked 
the conversion to give Canyon a 38-29 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On the third play of the ensuing drive, Notre Dame tailback Errol Small fumbled 
at his own 41 and the ball was recovered by Canyon's Vince Nevieux. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, quarterback Tim Beidle's pass was intercepted by Guillermo 
Eguez at the 29. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame quarterback Greg Andrachick created the third turnover in less than 
a minute when his pass was intercepted by Scott Blade at the 40. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, Beidle scored the final touchdown, from the 10. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (3-1) trailed, 24-14, at halftime but came out hot in the third 
quarter. The Knights stopped Canyon (1-2-1) on fourth and two at the Cowboys' 
23 and scored four plays later on an 11-yard run by Fano Malieitulua. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon answered with a lengthy drive that ended on a two-yard Peery touchdown 
dive with 3:04 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"They controlled the first half with (receiver Clint) Beauer and the second 
with Peery," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Beauer, who scored two first-half touchdowns, caught five passes for 121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
After Peery's touchdown, the Knights battled back with a 73-yard drive. On a 
fourth-and-goal play, Small, who finished with a game-high 127 rushing yards in 
22 carries, crashed in from the one. Andrachick hit Malieitulua on a conversion 
pass to trim the deficit to 31-29. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which took a quick 14-0 lead, increased the margin to 17 points with 
5:18 to play in the first half when Beidle dumped a short pass across the 
middle to Beauer, who cut to the sideline, broke up the field and outran the 
Notre Dame secondary for a 56-yard score. Mann's kick made the score 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
A scrambling Andrachick hit Matt Henry with a scoring pass for Notre Dame 55 
seconds before intermission to draw the Knights within 10, 24-14.

COACHES RELUCTANT TO DESIGNATE A FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer9/30/89 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are times when prying straight talk from Robin Williams is less difficult 
than doing the same from a college football coach. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to performing the ol' soft shoe, coaches can be as adept as Fred 
Astaire in waltzing around a direct question. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: 
</P>
<P>
Coach, which of the six teams in the Western Football Conference should be 
favored to win the championship? 
</P>
<P>
And a one, and a two, and a . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Any one of us could win it," said Lyle Setencich, coach of Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo. "It will probably come down to whoever gets the most breaks." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cal State Northridge's Bob Burt: "It's going to be very competitive. I 
don't know if anyone can make it through undefeated." 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes in the WFC, where coaches abide by the credo, "Thou shall not be 
quoted saying anything that might end up on thy opponent's bulletin board." 
</P>
<P>
The way the coaches tell it, all WFC teams were created equal. Therefore, all 
should be considered title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Sacramento and Santa Clara each emerged from their nonconference 
schedules with 3-1 records, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo went 2-1, Cal State 
Northridge and Portland State each split four games and Southern Utah State 
went 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that the coaches are actually being truthful? 
</P>
<P>
Portland, two-time defending WFC champion, carried the favorite's role at the 
start of the season -- largely because people believed that 5-foot-5 tailback 
Curtis Delgardo was good enough to carry the Vikings and their defensive 
deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed, however, when Delgardo, the conference's top offensive player 
in 1988, suffered a broken ankle in a game at Montana two weeks ago. He is out 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Portland had won its first two games -- including an impressive 29-20 decision 
over Idaho -- and was leading Montana when Delgardo left the game. The Vikings 
lost that game, 30-21, and were routed, 31-12, by Texas A&amp;I last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet people were really quakin' in their boots after that Idaho game," 
Portland Coach Pokey Allen said. "Well, I'll bet they're not quakin' anymore. 
We're just not very good right now. We move the ball, but then we make big 
mistakes that keep us from scoring." 
</P>
<P>
With Delgardo out, Portland has turned to a passing game. Darren Del'Andrae, a 
former Calabasas High standout, leads WFC quarterbacks in passing yardage with 
990 yards. He suffered through his worst game of the season last week, 
completing 14 of 36 passes for 163 yards with four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Can Portland rebound without Delgardo? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope so," Allen said, "because he's not going to resurrect. People say he's 
the reason we've lost two straight, but he never did play defense. That's where 
we're getting beat." 
</P>
<P>
Portland opponents are averaging 422.8 yards a game and 5.8 yards a play. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, which will play host to Portland today, has the conference's No. 1 
defense, allowing an average of 272.3 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento, which advanced to the semifinal round of the Division II playoffs 
last season, has the WFC's most balanced and explosive offense. With Drew 
Wyant, a three-year starter, calling signals, the Hornets average 249 yards 
passing and 173.8 rushing a game. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Utah State, which opens at Sacramento, has the conference's top ground 
attack. The Thunderbirds, who run the option, have gained an average of 248.7 
rushing yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and San Luis Obispo both have designs on the top perch, making their 
game tonight a key one. CSUN's offense is built around tailback Albert Fann, 
who has accounted for 813 yards in four games. SLO counters with a defense that 
makes the school's call letters a misnomer. The Mustangs had the Division II's 
toughest defense against the run last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important for any one of us to get off on a good start," 
Setencich said. "We should all be competitive. At this point I don't think you 
can say anyone is better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Had Delgardo not gone down, perhaps all the talk of parity might have been 
spared. Allen, who is in his fourth season as Portland's coach, was ready to 
shoulder the favorite's role early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
But now, even he is hedging on picking a winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be totally honest," he said. "I have absolutely no idea who's going to 
win it." 
</P>
<P>
If, indeed, anyone does, they're not saying.

SAN FERNANDO OFFENSE GOES 0 FOR SEPTEMBER

<P>
San Fernando High's September death march stumbled to a close Friday night 
against another tough Southern Section football team. 
</P>
<P>
This time, San Fernando absorbed a 28-0 drubbing from Division I St. Paul, a 
talented and disciplined band of Swordsmen who took their first win of the year 
after losses to Loyola, Long Beach Wilson and Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
As for 'Nando? 
</P>
<P>
They leave September winless (0-3) in their worst start since 1981 and, 
astonishingly, without an offensive touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
All this despite the presence of one of the City Section's finest quarterbacks 
in Michael Wynn, who had a rough go of it dodging rushers and was sacked five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not frustrated so much as I'm curious," Wynn said. "Curious to see what 
this offense can do when we put it all together." 
</P>
<P>
The partisan St. Paul crowd got a chance to see what Wynn could do when given a 
chance as the senior danced and weaved for 69 yards in 12 carries, not counting 
the sacks. 
</P>
<P>
In the air, Wynn completed seven of 17 for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But the only thing offensive about San Fernando's play was its glaring lack of 
discipline; the Tigers were whistled 12 times for 105 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael's trying to do a lot of things," San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez said 
after the game. "There's a big load on him right now, a lot of pressure on him 
to get the team going." The tone of the game was set early for San Fernando, 
whose defense jumped offside on the first two scrimmage plays to allow St. Paul 
its initial first down without breaking a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul quarterback Albert Borunda later ran two yards to make it 7-0 before 
the San Fernando offense took the field. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn was sacked three times in the first half and threw one interception as San 
Fernando failed to put the ball into St. Paul territory by intermission, at 
which point the game was effectively over. 
</P>
<P>
Next up for San Fernando? 
</P>
<P>
A game against Canoga Park, which, relatively speaking, must seem like a cool 
breeze for the Tigers in the midst of this huge desert. 
</P>
<P>
"(San Fernando) has a lot of talent," St. Paul Coach Miguel Olmedo said. "There 
are still a lot of things they can do." 
</P>
<P>
And Hernandez knows where they can start. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have to get the ball into the end zone," he said as the field 
emptied. "We've just got to get it in the damn end zone."

ALEMANY RIDDLES PALMDALE, 35-15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palmdale High defense -- what defense? -- was reminiscent Friday night of 
the stunt man in the beer commercial who gets shot up in the saloon. 
</P>
<P>
It was full of holes and sprang touchdown-size leaks all night. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany quarterback Joey Rosselli was the gunfighter with the smoking pistol as 
he threw for 338 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Indians to a 35-15 
victory in a nonleague game at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli, who completed 18 of 27 passes and threw one interception, lofted a 
pair of 69-yard touchdown tosses (to Terry Barnum and Greg Benitez) in the 
second half as Alemany expanded on its 14-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosselli is a hell of a quarterback. He put the ball in there all night," 
Alemany Coach Pat Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
The senior quarterback's heroics bailed out the Indians (2-2), who were limited 
to 31 yards rushing by Palmdale (0-4), a Division II semifinalist last season. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli threw first-half touchdown passes of 13 and 12 yards to Mark 
Dannemiller and Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemiller also returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown in the third 
period as Alemany took a 28-3 lead after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Benitez had four catches for 134 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams were penalized for more than 100 yards -- Alemany 13 times for 122 
yards and Palmdale 10 times for 108 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale turned the ball over five times. Quarterback Joe Pica threw two 
interceptions and completed 12 of 34 passes for 196 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli completed his first eight passes and finished 11 of 13 for 124 yards 
and two touchdowns in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Leite's 23-yard field goal gave Palmdale a 3-0 lead late in the first 
quarter, but Rosselli responded by leading Alemany on a 74-yard drive that was 
capped by a 13-yard touchdown pass to Dannemiller as the Indians took the lead 
for good.

Crescenta Valley 35, South Pasadena 9 -- Ryan Kadletz completed seven of nine 
passes for 142 yards and four touchdowns as Crescenta Valley (3-1) won handily 
at South Pasadena (0-4). 
</P>
<P>
Kadletz completed his first four passes, two of which went for touchdowns. The 
senior quarterback hit Shane Cowsill for scoring passes of four and 17 yards as 
Crescenta Valley jumped to a 14-0 lead. Kadletz followed with a 20-yard pass to 
Javier Pimentel, and Pimentel added a two-yard run for a 28-0 halftime lead.

Moorpark 34, Nordhoff 7 -- The Musketeers rushed for 330 yards and five 
touchdowns at home to improve to 4-0, their best start since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Upshaw gained 152 yards in 14 carries and scored two touchdowns -- his 
11th and 12th of the season -- for Moorpark, despite playing in only the first 
half because of a slightly sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw was replaced in the second half by Chris Aguilar, who gained 114 yards

NEWBURY PARK STIFLES ROYAL IN LEAGUE OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Newbury Park High continued to suffocate opposing offenses as the Panthers 
posted their second consecutive shutout with a 21-0 victory Friday night over 
Royal in a Marmonte League opener at Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Panther defense has not allowed a touchdown all season. Newbury Park 
(3-0-1) shut out Buena, 15-0, last week and defeated Agoura, 17-3, three weeks 
ago. Ventura tied the Panthers, 7-7, two weeks ago but the Ventura touchdown 
was scored on an interception return. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers' stingy defense and ball-control offense held the Highlanders to 
28 first-half yards, all by way of the pass. Newbury Park fullback Jason Sands 
scored the only touchdown in the half on a two-yard run as time ran out in the 
first quarter. Royal's defense committed a key blunder in the Panther drive -- 
a holding penalty on a fourth-and-seven play at the Royal 33. Sands, a senior, 
finished with a game-high 62 yards rushing in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, taking a play from the Chicago Bears' book, had some fun late in 
the game. Phil Pederson, a 275-pound tackle, ambled in a la William Perry from 
one yard for Newbury Park's final touchdown with 1:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
After halftime, Royal (1-3, 0-1) conducted its best drive of the game but could 
not convert a 49-yard field-goal attempt by Steve Prchal. Highlander 
quarterback Ryan Fien, a sophomore, completed 15 of 24 passes for 120 yards but 
threw one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park junior tailback Walter Thomas carried 16 times for 59 yards and 
caught a 10-yard pass for a touchdown as time ran out in the third quarter. 
Royal gained only 25 yards rushing and 145 total yards. GREG MEADE

Glendale 20, Burroughs 14 -- Sophomore tailback Pathon Rucker rushed for 173 
yards and a touchdown in 28 carries to lead the Dynamiters at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (2-2) increased a five-point fourth-quarter lead to 18-7 when 
quarterback Eric Kiesau connected on a 40-yard touchdown pass to John Martell. 
Burroughs (1-3) had two chances to overcome a 12-7 deficit in the third quarter 
but twice fumbled exchanges from center within the Glendale five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, who rushed for 237 yards last week against Bell-Jeff, scored his 
touchdown on a 40-yard run in the first quarter to cap an 80-yard drive. He 
carried the ball on all eight plays of the drive. MIKE GELLER

Former Hart High and College of the Canyons standout Mitch McMullen has agreed

Memphis, Tenn., on Friday.

"It feels good, but nothing to get too excited about," said McMullen, a

possibly can and show that I'm a hard worker."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'NIGHT STALKER' JURY BREAKS FOR WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors deliberating the fate of convicted "Night Stalker" Richard Ramirez broke 
for the weekend Friday without reaching agreement on whether to recommend that 
he die in San Quentin's gas chamber or be sentenced to life in prison without 
the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court jury must decide between the two alternatives 
during the penalty phase of the 13-month-long trial, after finding the 
29-year-old El Paso, Tex., drifter guilty of 13 murders and 30 other felonies 
during a seemingly random crime rampage in the spring and summer of 1985 that 
terrorized Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of seven women and five men began deliberations after listening 
intently to arguments by both sides Wednesday. The prosecution urged them to 
give the killer his "just deserts," while the defense asked for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
The defense -- with Ramirez's agreement -- decided not to call any witnesses 
during the penalty phase, saying that would prevent the prosecution from 
putting on rebuttal witnesses, avoid putting the defendant's entire life on 
display, and spare his family and childhood friends the ordeal of testifying. 
</P>
<P>
Deliberations are scheduled to resume Monday morning.

San Diego County sued 13 building manufacturers Friday whose 
asbestos-containing products were used anywhere from 15 to 30 years ago in the 
county courthouse and its adjoining jail, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, authorized by the County Board of Supervisors and filed in the 
U.S. District Court in downtown San Diego, seeks to recover the expense of 
removing asbestos discovered in the county buildings in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The exact amount sought was not included in the lawsuit because officials have 
not yet determined the extent of the damage, county spokesman Bob Lerner said. 
But, he added, "It will run into the millions." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the manufacturers, including primary defendant W. R. 
Grace &amp; Co. of New York, either knew or should have known of the health 
hazards associated with asbestos when the material was sold to the county, said 
Tom Penfield, an attorney with Casey, Gerry, Casey, Westbrook, Reed &amp; 
Hughes. The San Diego-based law firm, which has extensive experience in 
asbestos litigation, is representing the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Knew It Was Harmful' 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking this action because, ultimately, the manufacturer was 
responsible. . . . They knew it was harmful," said Supervisor Susan Golding 
about the cancer-causing agent that was outlawed in 1979. Federal law also 
requires removal of asbestos before a building's renovation or demolition to 
prevent the release of asbestos fibers into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"People working in buildings or just visiting buildings with loose asbestos can 
be harmed," Golding said. "That's why we're determined to correct the problem. 
But the cost of removing asbestos is astronomical. There is no question that we 
do not have enough money in the county budget to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The suit targets only the asbestos found in the courthouse and the jail. County 
officials believe the material could have been placed in the two facilities 
during its construction from 1959 to 1961 and during seven major renovations, 
the last one reaching into the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
More lawsuits may soon follow, Golding added. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surveying all county buildings, and we will specify the 
highest-priority buildings and address them as quickly as possible," Golding 
said. "After taking a look, if we determine that a lawsuit is required, we will 
file them. We really don't have a choice in the matter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Lengthy Process 
</P>
<P>
Growing concern in recent years over the dangers of asbestos has spurred 
governments to either remove or encapsulate loose microscopic asbestos fibers 
commonly found in more than 3,000 building products such as cable insulation, 
roof shingles and fireproofing coatings or materials. The Environmental 
Protection Agency estimates that more than 733,000 public and commercial 
buildings in the United States contain asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"Discovering asbestos is a somewhat lengthy process," Penfield said. "You have 
to have people who are specially trained to identify the substance, which then 
has to be confirmed in the lab." 
</P>
<P>
Besides recovering the cost of replacing the asbestos with non-hazardous 
materials, the lawsuit seeks to receive reimbursement for testing and other 
associated costs. Efforts to inform employees about the presence of asbestos, 
instituting strict work requirements and installing warning labels are all 
costly procedures, Penfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Penfield's firm is also representing the city of San Diego in similar 
cost-recovery litigation. The case, involving the discovery of asbestos in 
eight city buildings, is scheduled to go to trial Aug. 1, 1990. Another case, 
involving more city buildings, is scheduled to go to trial Aug. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Besides W. R. Grace &amp; Co., the county lawsuit names Thorpe Insulations, 
Fibreboard Corp., Armstrong World Industries, Durabla Corp., Francis Steam 
Generator Co., Garlock Inc., H.K. Porter Co. Inc., Keene Corp., Keene Building 
Products Corp., Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., Owens-Illinois Glass Co. and 
Pabco Inc.

MAN RECEIVES LIFE TERM FOR KILLING OWNER OF RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego County man was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the 
possibility of parole for the 1987 shooting death of the owner of a fast-food 
chicken restaurant in Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Taylor, 24, of Oceanside was convicted by a San Fernando Superior Court 
jury last month of murder, attempted robbery and unlawfully taking a vehicle. 
Prosecutors described the death of Pioneer Chicken restaurant owner Louis Lim, 
who had bought the business just two months earlier, as a robbery gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and another man entered the restaurant on Foothill Boulevard on the 
afternoon of Nov. 19, 1987, while Lim, 35, of Baldwin Hills, was in the kitchen 
mixing juice, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said the other man 
served as a lookout while Taylor walked into the kitchen and fatally shot Lim 
in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty against Taylor because of lingering 
doubts about whether he was the gunman or the lookout, Richman said. But trial 
testimony of several witnesses convinced prosecutors and the jury that Taylor 
was the gunman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The second man has not been arrested or identified. 
</P>
<P>
Fingerprints recovered from an abandoned stolen car that Taylor and the other 
man used to flee the restaurant linked Taylor to the crime, Richman said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the crime was intended to be a robbery, despite the 
fact that the two men fled without demanding any money, Richman said, adding 
that investigators discounted the possibility that the two men were hired to 
kill Lim. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was on parole for a previous robbery at the time of the incident, 
according to court documents. He was convicted in 1983 of robbery and sentenced 
to a five-year prison term. While incarcerated, he was convicted of possessing 
a weapon in prison. He was paroled in late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was sentenced by San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors on Friday approved funding to create a jail 
medical-services quality plan and an inmate-death review committee. 
</P>
<P>
Until a permanent committee is established in a few months, an interim 
committee has been organized to allow independent medical experts to review 
recent inmate deaths, according to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors also charged the County Department of Health Services to review 
certain aspects of jail health care, including ambulance treatment of 
in-custody patients and treatment given to individuals admitted to licensed, 
acute-care facilities. The department will also be responsible for reviewing 
treatment procedures associated with in-custody patient deaths, according to 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Health services officials are currently taking steps -- including acquiring 
necessary medical records and meeting with sheriff's jail management -- toward 
establishing the permanent inmate-death review committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former City Councilman Mike Schaefer was acquitted Friday of a misdemeanor 
contempt-of-court citation alleging that he had interfered in a bankruptcy 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, a perennial candidate for local and state offices since he left the 
council in the 1970s, acted as his own attorney in a non-jury trial conducted 
by U. S. District Court Judge Rudi Brewster. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office had alleged that Schaefer had contacted other 
attorneys in the bankruptcy case, filed documents, and had interfered with the 
appointed trustee in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster found that while some of the contacts may have occurred, Schaefer did 
not have criminal intent to interfere with the trustee.

APPLAUSE FOR BRAUDE DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Braude's decision serves the best interests of the public by guaranteeing 
needed fire protection, park access, traffic mobility and potential traffic 
relief to Encino residents. His decisive position on a controversial issue 
reflects courage. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments that the Reseda extension and the needed paving of Mulholland Drive 
will bring about hillside development and the activation of dump sites has been 
refuted. Nearly all of the area around Mulholland Drive from Reseda Boulevard 
to Encino Hills Drive, which would complete a commuter route, is publicly owned 
so that there can be no private development. Councilman Braude states in his 
letter to 800 individuals who had contacted him on the issue of the Reseda 
extension that "Los Angeles County's getting a permit for a dump in Rustic and 
Sullivan canyons is a political impossibility." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Reseda Boulevard-Mulholland Drive link will be built, we must 
proceed to the task of paving Mulholland Drive to bring about traffic relief 
and to open up opportunities for everyone to enjoy our parklands.

BENEFITS OF LIGHT RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've been following the Valley's controversy over rail transit, you 
already know about the wonderful opportunity at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific wants to sell the Chandler-Victory route. This means it could 
be used without any need to share with the heavy rail trains now running each 
day. The stage is set to develop a system that satisfies all of the objections 
raised so far. Higher costs and delays of other methods can be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting on the L. A.-Long Beach light-rail test runs, The Times revealed: 
"The car is so quiet and fast that people need to take extra care to stay out 
of its way." In fact, the noisiest part of light rail is the warning system of 
horns and bells. There's no rumble or vibration like heavy rail. 
</P>
<P>
Placing Metro Rail 25 feet below ground doesn't eliminate its heavy rail 
rumbling. The controversy over routes near Hollywood recording studios confirms 
this. 
</P>
<P>
The city should buy the Chandler-Victory route and dig a trench, allowing grade 
separation crossings without bells and horns. Aesthetically designed walls 
could contain the whirring sound of passing trains. Neighborhoods bothered by a 
residual sound could separately pay to install a roof over the trench. 
</P>
<P>
History demonstrates that property values always are enhanced by easy access to 
transit corridors. Just look at the main streets near the freeway on- and 
off-ramps. But neighborhoods not interested in the amenities of transit should 
be allowed to choose to have no nearby stations. 
</P>
<P>
I live five doors from Chandler, near Laurel Canyon. The Red Cars stopped there 
and I miss them. I hope for a nearby light-rail station someday.

COVERAGE OF SAUGUS TEACHER DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We can no longer be silent regarding factual errors and slanted coverage of the 
Saugus teachers' salary and insurance disputes with the Saugus district! 
</P>
<P>
We have noted in all media coverage that Supt. Chris Wilson is given 
credibility as having accurate facts and interpretations. Teachers' comments 
are given little credence and few of the facts we present ever make it to 
print. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times article (Sept. 23) reported: "Supt. Chris Wilson said the 
two sides agreed on an improved fringe benefits package." 
</P>
<P>
We have indeed agreed to a fringe benefits package -- finally. However, the 
district initially proposed cutting benefits and adding out-of-pocket expenses 
for status quo coverage. In the final package, coverage was reinstated at a 
status quo level in most areas. The one exception was that many of our teachers 
were forced to change medical insurance carriers, with some adverse changes of 
coverage. Who would justly call this an improved benefit package? 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are asking for a salary increase of 12% this year, based on 
contractual language that allows negotiations to reopen with the advent of new 
legislation. Although our initial proposal included a 12% increase for the 
following year, in an effort to bargain in good faith, the salary proposal for 
next year was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson did not acknowledge this concession by the teachers. The district 
negotiators, conversely, have continually offered no salary increase in their 
counterproposals. Saugus teachers are paid in the bottom quartile when compared 
to teachers in the 33 elementary districts of Los Angeles County. However, 
Saugus administrators are paid in the top quartile compared to other 
administrators in the same elementary districts. 
</P>
<P>
The Times did not even address the teachers' perspective on this crisis. 
However, Wilson's inaccurate comments are given credibility to the community by 
the omission of any facts or opinions that would contradict them.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RV PASSENGER DIES FROM CRASH INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 68-year-old Oklahoma woman who was among six people injured in a traffic 
collision near Palmdale has died of her injuries, hospital officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wanda Leak died Thursday night after being thrown from a motor home that was 
struck by a large truck at the intersection of Fort Tejon Road, Pearblossom 
Highway and Avenue T, said Frankie Richards, spokeswoman for Antelope Valley 
Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, hospital officials upgraded the conditions of the two other 
seriously injured victims of the crash. Edward Leak, 79, driver of the motor 
home, and passenger Gladys Cline, 74, were in stable condition after being 
admitted to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center in critical condition Thursday, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Davis, 72; Robert Cline, 79, and Don Lile, 46, driver of the truck, were 
released from hospitals after being treated for minor injuries, hospital 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
The motor home occupants were from Putnam, Okla., and were on their way to 
visit relatives in San Bernardino County when the vehicle ran a red light at 
Avenue T and was struck by the truck, which was northbound on Pearblossom, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck spilled its load of straw bales as it careened out of control into a 
gas station, narrowly missing gas pumps, authorities said. Three other cars 
sustained minor damage after being hit by the bales and debris from a light 
post and traffic signal knocked over by the truck, officials said.

IN A BATTLE OF WITTS, THE RANGERS WIN, 5-0; 
</P>
<P>
TEXAS' BOBBY WITT BEATS THE ANGELS' MIKE WITT WITH A TWO-HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a night made for puns, if not winning Angel baseball. Mike Witt started 
for the Angels, Bobby Witt started for the Texas Rangers, and before Friday 
evening was through, you knew someone was going to get out-Witted. 
</P>
<P>
 For six innings, this battle of Witts -- OK, we'll stop there -- was a near 
standoff, save for that one ball Texas' Pete Incaviglia deposited over the 
right-field fence. Mike was working on a three-hitter, Bobby had a two-hitter, 
and a tense 1-0 struggle entered the top of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the struggle would be over. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Mike Witt suddenly reverted to the form that made him the only 
losing pitcher in the Angel rotation, and before the inning was complete, the 
Rangers would be well on their way to a 5-0 victory before 27,598 fans at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Stanley got it all started, following Incaviglia's leadoff ground-out with 
a single to center field. Scott Coolbaugh followed with a carbon copy, and the 
Rangers had runners on first and third for pinch-hitter Thad Bosley, the former 
Angel. 
</P>
<P>
Bosley lined a double into the right-field corner to score Stanley for one run. 
Fred Manrique then bunted back to Witt for a successful squeeze to score 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Jeff Kunkel added another single to right field to score Bosley, 
leaving the Angels down, 4-0, and sending one Witt out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The first two pitchers to emerge from the Angel bullpen, Bob McClure and Greg 
Minton, combined to yield a fifth run in the eighth inning, with McClure 
surrendering a double to Ruben Sierra and Minton giving up the Coolbaugh single 
that brought him home. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bobby Witt was putting the finishing touches on his first shutout of 
the season and a victory that would bring his final 1989 record to 12-13. 
</P>
<P>
Witt allowed the Angels only a pair of singles -- with just one exitting the 
infield. That came in the fourth inning on a line drive to center field by 
Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Angel hit was a grounder deep into the hole at shortstop that 
Lance Parrish legged out in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Witt also struck out 10 and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
After walking Dick Schofield in the bottom of the fifth, Witt retired the last 
14 Angels in order -- striking out Chili Davis and Downing in the bottom of the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
About the other Witt: Friday brought a close to his worst season since 1983, 
when he finished 7-14 with an earned-run average of 4.91. This year, Witt wound 
up 9-15 -- failing to reach double figures in wins for the first time in six 
season -- with an ERA of 4.54. 
</P>
<P>
Incaviglia's home run was the 26th allowed this season by Witt, easiest the 
highest total on the Angel staff. (Kirk McCaskill is second with 15). 
</P>
<P>
Witt went 1-5 in his last eight starts and 2-8 in 15 starts after July 9. An 
American League All-Star selection in 1986 and '87, Witt is a cumulative 22-31 
in 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a godsend the season is over for him," Angel Manager Doug Rader 
said. "He can regroup and work with (pitching coach Marcel Lachemann) over the 
winter and come back strong next year." 
</P>
<P>
But come back for whom? 
</P>
<P>
A disappointment in each of his last two seasons, Witt is finishing the second 
year of a two-year, $2.8-million contract. The Angels are expecting to enter 
the Mark Langston free-agent sweepstakes with passion and, if successful, Mike 
Witt could be expendable. 
</P>
<P>
If not, he still might be expendable. Witt's name figures to be bandied around 
all winter in trade rumors, although Rader was trying to get a head start on 
defusing them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame he's had to go through a year like he's had to go through," Rader 
said, "but he's not the first guy to go through it . . . 
</P>
<P>
"All the pieces are there; we just need to put them together. He's got a 
quality arm and he's a quality guy. I don't see how you can't keep guys like 
that around." 
</P>
<P>
Witt's final start of 1989 began fittingly enough -- with an error. Angel 
second baseman Johnny Ray misplayed Manrique's leadoff ground ball, and after a 
one-out walk to Rafael Palmiero, Witt was in trouble again, allowing Manrique 
to reach third on an infield out by Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
But Witt temporarily pitched his way out of the predicament by striking out 
Harold Baines for the third out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Before Witt recorded another out, however, Incaviglia had essentially decided 
Friday's outcome. Incaviglia led off the second inning with his 21st home run 
of the season, and through six innings that was the difference in Witt vs. 
Witt. 
</P>
<P>
Things bogged down quickly for Mike Witt in the seventh, and he never made it 
into the eighth. Replaced by McClure with two outs in the seventh, Witt left 
after allowing four runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He walked two and 
struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Angels had reached Witt's end. And for that, at least in 1989, 
both team and pitcher were grateful. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
That's Incidental With An I: Pete Incaviglia's second-inning home run against 
Mike Witt was the 100th homer of his career, which seemed a nice little 
achievement until Texas publicity director John Blake did some research. 
According to Blake, Incaviglia is now the all-time major league home run leader 
among players with last names beginning in I. Yes, before Incaviglia, that 
distinction belonged to Monte Irvin, who ended his career with 99 homers. The 
Iorg brothers were left in the dust a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
Upon doctor's orders, Ranger second baseman Julio Franco is sitting out the 
remainder of the season. Franco injured his lower back last Saturday and 
underwent a battery of medical tests in Arlington, Tex., Thursday. All X-rays 
and bone scans proved negative, with the injury being diagnosed as a "severe 
muscle strain." Fred Manrique started in place of Franco Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Angel owner Gene Autry turned 82 Friday, an event noted during the 
seventh-inning stretch when the Anaheim Stadium crowd, with prompting from 
public-address announcer Dennis Packer, broke into a chorus of "Happy 
Birthday." More exhaustive research, this done by the Angel publicity staff, 
determined that the Angels are 11-12 in games played on Autry's birthday.

FEELING THE HEAT;

<P>
NOTHING MUCH COOL ABOUT PHOENIX EXCEPT FOR ITS FEELING TOWARD NFL CARDINALS

<P>
There is a popular assumption that the honeymoon between the transplanted 
football Cardinals and the people of Phoenix is over. 
</P>
<P>
This is wrong. There never was a honeymoon in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
When Cardinal owner Bill Bidwill brought his team from St. Louis before the 
1988 season, it seemed that his first move was to alienate his new customers. 
The Cardinals' price-gouging and general front-office ineptitude combined to 
turn off fans before their imported heroes had played a game. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the animosity has died down somewhat, but the damage isn't close 
to being repaired. Cardinal season-ticket sales have plunged 31% from 55,000 to 
37,900, and a crowd of only 40,000 to 45,000 is expected Sunday for their home 
opener against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Once it became obvious that an adversary relationship had been established, 
Phoenix sports writers began bombarding Bidwill in print. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gilmartin, veteran columnist of the Phoenix Gazette, summed up the 
situation with a remark after Bidwill underwent gall bladder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Gilmartin: "The bladder was removed, but the gall remained." 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't the first time the Cardinals had packed their belongings and left 
town. They were originally based in Chicago but, tired of playing second fiddle 
to the immensely popular Bears, they moved to St. Louis after the 1959 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals and Bears are the only surviving charter members of the National 
Football League, which was founded in 1920 as the American Professional 
Football Assn. Since the Bears began as the Decatur Staleys, the Cardinals are 
the only team to carry the same nickname throughout the league's 70 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Still, tradition hasn't helped the Cardinals. Even after escaping the shadow of 
the Bears, they failed to catch on in St. Louis. They drew only 23,336 per game 
in their first season there, reached their all-time high at 48,084 in 1981 and 
fell to 27,821 in 1987. Their largest crowd in 28 seasons at Busch Memorial 
Stadium was 51,010 for the Rams in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the franchise's long history of frustration, Bidwill might have 
been expected to shower the folks of Phoenix with kindness. He finally had 
found a city that was hungry for an NFL team, one with a stadium big enough for 
him to turn a profit. The Cardinals arranged to play in Arizona State's Sun 
Devil Stadium, which has a seating capacity of 72,000. 
</P>
<P>
But all these positive factors did for Bidwill was lead to greed. He set up an 
average ticket price of $38, the highest in the NFL by a whopping $12. When the 
fans rebelled, they had to air their complaints by mail, because the Cardinals 
didn't list their telephone number for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwill was even hindered by a ticket situation that was beyond his control. 
Under a previous agreement with Arizona State, season-ticket holders of the 
Arizona Outlaws of the defunct United States Football League had first call on 
season tickets of any NFL team that would occupy Sun Devil Stadium. There were 
only 15,000 of those, but ASU had 55,000 for college football, and they held 
second priority. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that any new Phoenix fans had to pay exorbitant prices for bad 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a public relations blunder of monumental proportions," Gilmartin said 
in a phone conversation. "The Cardinals as much as said, 'If you can't afford 
it, sorry. Just get your money out.' 
</P>
<P>
"After the initial reaction, they compounded their mistake. They had an 
opportunity to backtrack and roll back the prices. Sometimes you can turn a 
negative into a positive. But they didn't budge, and matters only got worse. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost as though they called the people in the front office together 
and said, 'Everybody likes us. How can we turn that around in an instant?' The 
hostility was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of all this, the Cardinals drew a franchise-record 472,937 fans last 
year, a 59,117 average. They sold out one game, against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket scale has been restructured for the Cardinals' second season in 
Phoenix, but the average price has dropped only to $36. Bidwill will more than 
make up this meager difference with revenue from the stadium's 60 new luxury 
boxes, which rent for $60,000 each per year. The Cardinals will get $2.4 
million of the $3.6 million, ASU the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I've kind of praised the Cardinals lately," Gilmartin said. "I've 
suggested that Bidwill may be the league's most improved owner. The team had a 
good draft for a change, made some positive moves in the front office and 
signed 11 Plan B free agents, including (quarterback) Gary Hogeboom. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is, Bidwill had too much ground to make up." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmartin added that the Cardinals face the handicap of sharing the stadium 
with a college team that has made a habit of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here aren't bumpkins," Gilmartin said. "Having watched ASU over the 
years, they believe a 10-1 record on up is OK." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals have started out 2-1 but figure to finish under .500 in the tough 
NFC East. They were 7-9 last year, and since then have lost quarterback Neil 
Lomax with what may be a career-ending hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Bidwill has declined to discuss the controversy swirling around 
him. Because he is inaccessible by phone, Terry Bledsoe, vice president of 
communications, served as the Cardinals' spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're concerned about the decrease in season tickets," Bledsoe 
said. "We expected it to be down, but not this much. We've got to build it up, 
but we've got to win to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are any number of valid reasons for the problem, and part of it is 
nothing more than the economy in Phoenix. By the year 2000, this will be the 
seventh or eighth largest city in the country, but we're in a recession right 
now. The housing market is in a bad slump." 
</P>
<P>
The excuse used most often is the intense heat in Phoenix. There already have 
been 125 days this year with the temperature above 100, and the heat wave isn't 
over yet. Because of this, the NFL scheduled the Cardinals' first three games 
away from home. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 90% (season-ticket) renewals on the shaded side of the stadium," 
Bledsoe said. "Virtually all the cancellations have been on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, though, I think the heat will be overcome when we win. The people 
here are outside more than they are anywhere other than a place like San Diego. 
If they're not at the game, they're playing golf or doing something else 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"People live here because of the weather. They jog, ride bikes, things like 
that. If they want to do it, they do it. People in Green Bay sit outside in 
winter weather. You can say they're insane to do it, but they do it." 
</P>
<P>
In case the Cardinals don't win often enough to beat the heat, one solution 
being considered might be called outdoor air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"It sprays fine mist around the stadium," Bledsoe said, "and the mist 
evaporates as it descends, so the fans get cooled off without getting wet." 
</P>
<P>
Playing at night would help, but the Cardinals can do that only when television 
dictates, and that won't happen this year. The networks want winners on their 
prime-time telecasts. Charger Coach Dan Henning suggested the other day that 
the Cardinals start games at 4 p.m. instead of 1, but TV commitments make that 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were in the East, we would have the option of playing at 1 or 4," 
Bledsoe said. "Here, we have to play at either 10 or 1, or 11 or 2 when the 
rest of the country goes off daylight time. We're on standard time all-year 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we don't want to start games in the morning. One hope we have is 
that ESPN may have 16 Sunday night games under the new TV contract next year 
instead of eight. Maybe we could get a couple of early-season games on that 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the road ahead for Bidwill and the Cardinals will go uphill. Heat 
or no heat, they have many fences to mend. 
</P>
<P>
As Gilmartin put it, "When you start out by kicking people in the fannies and 
then try to put those fannies in pews, you're tackling a tough task."

Finally, after Rancho Buena Vista defeated Vista Friday night, 34-14, RBV Coach 
Craig Bell acknowledged what he had refused to admit all week. 
</P>
<P>
"You say this is just another league game," he said. "Then there are balloons, 
presentations, floats, you name it . . . " 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 RBV scored 20 second-half points to run away in the schools' first 
meeting. Markeith Ross scored on a 23-yard run, his second touchdown of the 
night, and James Lewis scored on runs of 28 and 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
There was as much activity off the field as there was on. There were 1,000 
balloons released before the game, as well as a gift exchange between the 
student governments. 
</P>
<P>
The game was dedicated to Sal Aunese, a former Vista quarterback who died of 
cancer last Saturday. "Sal" was painted onto the field across the 50-yard line 
facing bleachers on both sides of the field, and a large red helmet with "8" -- 
Aunese's number at Vista -- was painted in the middle. SCOTT MILLER

POINTERS GET ANOTHER BIG VICTORY

Point Loma, trailing by two points after a see-saw first half, rallied behind 
the passing of Danny White to defeat visiting Dorsey, 36-34, Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh off an upset victory over then top-ranked Rancho Buena Vista last week, 
Point Loma (2-2) made it two in a row in game marred by 17 penalties. Dorsey is 
1-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we hung in with them," Pointers' Coach Ben Edens said. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma hung in there until it could put together the big plays it needs to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
It got them from Danny White, the county's leading passer, who completed 12 of 
19 passes for 226 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were a good team," White said, "and it came down to a few key 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
The Pointers made two key plays at the start of the fourth quarter to turn the 
game their way. J.J. Stokes caught a 30 yard pass from White to jump ahead 
28-22. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Cliff Ransom recovered the ball on an onside kick to give 
Point Loma another opportunity to score. Brett Callan caught a 48-yard pass 
from White to make it 34-22. Callan had six catches for 128 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead by 12, Point Loma went for the two-point conversion and got it when White 
passed to Callan. 
</P>
<P>
The two-point conversion became critical because Dorsey, trailing 36-28, scored 
with five seconds remaining when Kevin Copeland caught an 18-yard pass from 
Chris Cook to close the gap to 36-34. Dorsey had to try for two points, but a 
failed run gave Point Loma the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Perreira, one of Point Loma's leading rushers this year, was helped off 
the field with an ankle injury 10 minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a very important ball carrier," Edens said, "but he will be back." 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma came back without him Friday. LAURA PALMER

HOWARD ROSENBERG: AN INTRIGUING 'BIRD OF YOUTH' WITH TAYLOR AND HARMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Sweet Bird of Youth" transfers to television Sunday as a worthy and 
interesting character drama about desperate, self-corrupting people losing 
their struggle to live. 
</P>
<P>
Airing at 9 p.m. on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39), this version, starring 
Elizabeth Taylor and Mark Harmon, softens some of the passion and rawness of 
Tennessee Williams' play. But writer Gavin Lambert and director Nicolas Roeg do 
capture the despair, isolation and utter hopelessness of Williams' huddled 
lost, who speak to us from the much-segregated South of the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The characters smell of inward decay. Flamboyant actress Alexandra Del Lago 
(Taylor) and opportunistic drifter Chance Wayne (Harmon) come together at a 
crossroads in their miserable lives, briefly merging their demons and their 
dreams in St. Cloud, Fla., the small town that Chance fled years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In flight herself from the realities of age and a fading career, Alexandra has 
met and slept with the 30-ish Chance in Palm Beach after falling for his smile 
and special back rubs. In a stupor from drugs and booze, she now accompanies 
him back to St. Cloud, oblivious to his plans to exploit her and to the 
hostility and potential violence awaiting them from ambitious political boss 
Tom Finley (Rip Torn). 
</P>
<P>
Harmon is credible and has the magnetism for Chance. But there's no danger in 
his performance, and that hurts. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, however, performs grandly as Alexandra, who arrives in town beside 
Chance in her leased fin-tail convertible with the top down, wearing a mink 
coat and sipping from a flask that almost seems to be an extension of her hand. 
</P>
<P>
Although stout, Taylor at first looks almost too smoothly beautiful and 
youthful. Then comes the first close-up, when a network of thin lines appears 
beneath her eyes, revealing the very aging erosion that terrifies Alexandra. 
Watch for a wonderful scene when Alexandra, seeking security in her insecure 
companion, leans back against Chance, all wistful and dreamy, almost melting 
into his body. "By the time I was your age, I was already a legend," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The legend blurs along with Chance's dreams, his hopes for resurrection dying 
in St. Cloud as an old rendezvous with Finley's daughter (Cheryl Paris) comes 
back to haunt him and ultimately costs him "the only thing you have to get by 
on." Three guesses. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1962 movie version of "Sweet Bird of Youth," which starred Torn's late 
wife, Geraldine Page, and Paul Newman, the worst that the womanizing Chance had 
to face was a broken nose. On Sunday, true to the play, something far more 
extreme looms as a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, this adaptation is closer to the play than the movie was. In all 
ways, it's good viewing.

BLOOM'S GRACIOUS EVENING WITH THE BARD'S WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claire Bloom read Shakespeare Thursday night at Ambassador Auditorium, 
beautifully but not intimately. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was called "Then Let Men Know: A Portrait of Shakespeare's Women." 
Dressed in a simple black grown, Bloom presented excerpts from six plays, each 
focusing on a woman whom Bloom seemed to admire -- Viola in "Twelfth Night" for 
her ability to laugh at herself, Katharine of Aragon in "Henry VIII" for her 
refusal to be broken, Volumnia in "Coriolanus" for the magnificence of her 
scorn, Juliet in "Romeo and Juliet" for the magnificence of her resolve. 
</P>
<P>
As one expects from English actors, the words came first -- their shape, their 
music, the silences between them. But without losing herself in a scene, Bloom 
did more than read it. She acted it: the men's parts too. And everything she 
touched was well observed. Her women were no less women for being ladies. 
</P>
<P>
Juliet seemed to have earned Bloom's special respect, for conquering her fears 
in the tomb in such a soldierly fashion. What men were to "know," one gathered 
from this recital, was what strong stuff women were made of. 
</P>
<P>
To an American listener, the evening had a distance about it. Bloom gave us 
some background notes, but there was no clue as to why she preferred these 
particular scenes over others -- why "Twelfth Night" appealed to her more than 
"As You You Like It," for instance, which also has fun with the idea of a girl 
masquerading as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
You didn't want chitchat. In an age of fake intimacy, the distance was even 
refreshing: that of an instrumentalist who wants to be judged solely on her 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
But an actress isn't merely an instrumentalist. In an assignment of this sort, 
she has something in common with a lecturer. A good one always takes personal 
notice of the audience. We would have enjoyed meeting Claire Bloom Thursday 
night, as well as Juliet and Viola. 
</P>
<P>
Samm-Art Williams' "Woman From the Town" at the Inner City Cultural Center 
starts from the same place as Friedrich Duerrenmatt's "The Visit": A wealthy 
woman returns to the little town that scorned her. 
</P>
<P>
But while the heroine of "The Visit" is out for revenge, Williams' heroine may 
be disposed toward mercy. Actually, she ought to thank the town. If it hadn't 
cast her out, she never would have made big bucks up north. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she and her fatherless baby went through hell. So she will let the 
townspeople squirm for awhile as they start to realize who is buying up all the 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
A promising beginning. But "Woman From the Town" doesn't come together at ICCC. 
We're not sure at the end whether we've seen the story of a clever woman 
carrying through a well-laid scheme to save a town and yet put its inhabitants 
in their place, or the story of a woman who had to change her agenda when she 
fell in a love with a place that she thought she hated. 
</P>
<P>
What's needed is not more big speeches about the need to be true to "the land." 
Maybe we need more little speeches, evincing real small-town behavior. Williams 
has a talent for these, when he exercises it -- for example, the moment where 
the heroine's nephew agrees with her that he's all grown up now: "I've been in 
the Marines and everything." That's how people talk at home. But when the lines 
get programmatic, the play goes dead. 
</P>
<P>
There's something stiff about the production too. In a play about 
relationships, director Adeleane Hunter tends to let each actor stay in her own 
frame, doing her own number -- Donnice Wilson as the sophisticated heroine, 
Robyn Hastings as her self-assured daughter, Roxie Roker as her resentful 
sister, etc. Ensemble acting needs more overlap, especially in a family play. 
The easiest performance, if not the showiest one, comes from Eugene Lee as the 
nephew, one of those country boys who smile and smile, and end up owning the 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays at 1303 S. New Hampshire Ave., Thursdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 
3 p.m. Closes Oct. 22. Tickets $20; (213) 387-1161.

A world premiere musical that had a reading at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre 
Center in Waterford, Conn., two world premiere dramas, a West Coast premiere of 
a Eugene Ionesco play and a San Diego premiere by Canadian playwright George 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like an impressive season for any professional company, but these 
shows actually are a composite of what is scheduled on the seasons of the 
theater departments at UC San Diego, San Diego State University and United 
States International University. 
</P>
<P>
All these shows will be performed, and many will be directed, by graduate 
students. Still, the quality can be high. "Strindberg Sonata," a production 
last year at UCSD, picked up three San Diego Critics Circle nominations this 
year -- best production, best direction (Anne Bogart) and best new play (by 
Bogart, Jeff Halpern et. al). 
</P>
<P>
More commonly, the season can be used as an opportunity to preview talent 
before it goes professional. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent San Diego State graduates in San Diego theater include Craig Noel, 
executive director of the Old Globe Theatre, Kit Goldman, managing director of 
the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre, Dianne Holly, a faculty member at San Diego State, 
who is resident costume designer at the Gaslamp, and Kathy Najimy, co-star of 
the San Diego-spawned Off-Broadway hit, "The Kathy and Mo Show." 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego, which works exclusively with the La Jolla Playhouse, most 
recently gave us Jim Lewis, co-writer of "Dangerous Games," the Playhouse 
production that is soon to open on Broadway. And USIU's latest undergraduate 
success story is John Barrowman, who took a leave of absence to star in 
"Anything Goes" in London's West End. 
</P>
<P>
The world premiere musical "First Star" promises to be the star of the upcoming 
SDSU season. Written by Steve Lutvak and Mitchell Ivers, it tells the true 
story of America's first acting troupe, the Hallam Company, which came to 
America from Great Britain in the late 18th Century. Theater department 
chairwoman Alicia Annas has high hopes for the production, which was 
commissioned by theater professor Robert Chapel. The contract stipulates that 
San Diego State will be credited in 
</P>
<P>
any commercial productions. 
</P>
<P>
"First Star" will have a workshop production in November followed by a full 
production May 4-12 at the Don Powell Theatre. It will finish a season at SDSU 
that is already in progress with the the world premiere of a new translation by 
Jeffrey Mason of the Alexandre Dumas fils story "Lady of the Camellias," 
through Oct. 7 at the Don Powell. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the SDSU season includes: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Boys From Syracuse," the musical by Rodgers and Hart based on 
Shakespeare's "The Comedy of Errors," Oct. 20-28 at the Experimental Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
* The West Coast premiere of Ionesco's "Man With Bags," a story of cultural 
estrangement in which a man returns to his nameless native country and conducts 
a nightmarishly frustrating search for his family, friends and youth, Nov. 
10-18 at the Don Powell. 
</P>
<P>
* John Guare's "Landscape of the Body," about the struggles of a mother and son 
to survive in Greenwich Village, Feb. 17-24 at the Experimental Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
* William Shakespeare's "The Winter's Tale," the story of a jealous king, 
(which may be changed for another Shakespeare play). 
</P>
<P>
* "Zastrozzi: the Master of Discipline," a San Diego premiere about a cunning 
European criminal by Canadian playwright George Walker, March 30-April 7 at the 
Experimental Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of the UC San Diego season should be the work of 
acclaimed theater artist Andrei Serban (known for his electric stagings at 
Lincoln Center, La Mama Experimental Theatre, the New York Public Theatre and 
the Los Angeles Music Center), who will direct a play of his choosing April 
11-15 at the Mandell Weiss Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The other is "The Trials of Don Edwardo," a new play by graduate student 
playwright Daniel Camacho, which will be the premiere production by the new 
Hispanic-American Theatre program, May 9-13 at the Warren Theatre. The play, 
which will be directed by Jorge Huerta, theater department faculty member and 
head of the Hispanic-American Theatre program, will be presented in West 
Germany as part of the "International Conference on Hispanics in the United 
States" in July and continue to tour Europe. 
</P>
<P>
These two shows will conclude a season that begins with the participation of 
seven actors, three designers, two directors and one stage manager from the 
UCSD theater department in the La Jolla Playhouse production of "Macbeth," 
directed by Playhouse artistic director Des McAnuff Oct. 15-Nov. 19 at the 
Mandell Weiss Theatre. It continues with: 
</P>
<P>
* "Fefu and Her Friends," by six-time Obie-award winner Maria Irene Fornes 
about a group of women in the 1970s who look back at their idealism in the 
1930s, Nov. 1-12 at the Warren Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
* "Tartuffe," Moliere's classic about a scoundrel who worms his way into the 
heart of a gullible aristocrat susceptible to his flattery, Nov. 29-Dec. 3, at 
the Warren Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Bacchae," Euripides' tragedy about how a king's rejection of Bacchus, 
the god of wine and revelry, results in his own destruction, Jan. 31-Feb. 4 at 
the Mandell Weiss Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
* "Sweet Patria," a new play by graduate student William Reyes, tells the story 
of a general in charge of the secret police in a small Latin American town who 
is forced to confront a past that has come back to haunt him, Feb. 14-18 at the 
Warren Theatre. It will be presented next summer as a workshop production by 
Teatro de la Esperanza in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
* "From Morn to Midnight," by Georg Kaiser, an Expressionist tale of an 
Everyman who searches for an existence that affirms the significance of the 
human spirit, Feb. 28-March 4 at the Mandell Weiss Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
At USIU, musical theater usually dominates the season, and this year is no 
exception, with four popular musicals and two non-musicals scheduled. All will 
be at the Theatre in Old Town with the exception of "Hello Dolly!," the Michael 
Stewart &amp; Jerry Herman musical based on Thornton Wilder's play about 
busybody matchmaker Dolly Levi. "Hello Dolly!" will be presented at the Lyceum 
Theatre in Horton Plaza Feb. 14-March 11 as part of a USIU festival at the 
Lyceum, including presentations from the USIU ballet, orchestra and visual arts 
department. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the USIU season, though, may well be the USIU debut of film 
producer and director Jack Ofield, winner of a Peabody, an Emmy and an American 
Film Festival Blue Ribbon. Ofield, who also is a professor at San Diego State, 
will be taking a departure from his recent productions for PBS to direct the 
show of his choice -- "The Fantasticks." The Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt 
musical, still running Off Broadway after 29 years, tells the sweet and sour 
Romeo and Juliet story of two young lovers who meet despite a high garden wall 
that separates their houses, Jan. 31-March 18. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding these selections are: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Mikado, or The Town of Titipu," the Gilbert and Sullivan classic about 
Nanki Poo's courtship of Yum-Yum who is sadly affianced to the Lord High 
Executioner, Koko, set in ancient Japan, Oct. 4-29. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Front Page," the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur comedy about a tough 
reporter who tries to leave the business just before the story that may prove 
the biggest of his career begins to break, Nov. 15-Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
* "Cyrano de Bergerac," Edmond Rostand's story of the poet whose great nose 
stands between him and the woman he loves, April 11-29. 
</P>
<P>
* "Carnival," Michael Stewart and Robert Merrill's musical about an embittered 
carnival owner and his wandering troupe, May 16-June 10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SDSU: The world premiere musical "First Star," written by Steve Lutvak and 
Mitchell Ivers, should be the star of the season. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD: Acclaimed theater artist Andrei Serban, known for his electric stagings 
at Lincoln Center, will direct a play of his choosing. 
</P>

OBJECTIONABLE DIALOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Sept. 16, I watched the debut of "Sister Kate," and as the priest of St. 
Thomas' Episcopal Church in Hacienda Heights, I must object to some of the 
dialogue: After Sister Kate had just rescued one of her female orphans from an 
apparent "date-rape" by an arrogant and wealthy male socialite, the nun 
consoled the young woman by dismissing the young man as someone "who's probably 
an Episcopalian." 
</P>
<P>
I challenge KNBC for promoting such stereotyping of Episcopalians or of any 
other religious or ethnic group. It indeed surprises me that such a line could 
slip by in a time when most are trying to show greater sensitivity toward 
minorities of all kinds. To see how this one might sound to us Episcopalians, I 
invite you to substitute the name of your own favorite grouping into the above 
situation.

FACES . . .: HOPING FOR CONTROVERSY

"I'm hoping that there's controversy just in the sense of controversy, meaning 
that people talk about it, not that they're upset by it," says Kay Lenz of her 
upcoming "Midnight Caller" episode. Lenz will reprise her Emmy-winning role of 
Tina Cassidy, a woman who contracts the AIDS virus from an unsympathetic man. 
</P>
<P>
You may recall the brouhaha generated almost a year ago by gay rights 
organizations who were offended by the segment's original ending. That 
particular script, which Lenz called "well-written . . . wonderful," dictated 
that the uncaring bisexual character be killed at the end. Gay groups assailed 
this plot device as cruel and unusual punishment, so the producers relented and 
let him live. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that they changed it," says Lenz, whose character will be enduring 
the excruciating final four days of her life. "I don't think that it was a 
non-courageous act by doing that. You have to consider your viewing audience, 
and the impact that television -- from 'Pee-wee's Playhouse' to '60 Minutes' -- 
has on the people who watch that show." The script for the show, to air 
sometime next month, has been approved by those groups who were upset last fall 
by the "Midnight Caller" that might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Lenz prepared for this particularly agonizing role by sitting in with various 
women's support groups up in San Francisco. These were not easy sessions, says 
the former Mrs. David Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
"I went up a few weeks ago and it scared the hell out of me," says Lenz of the 
unpleasantries of this type of research. She has played hookers, cops posing as 
strippers and other diverse fare, but "this is something I cannot relate to. I 
cannot relate to this situation" of these innocent women with irreversible 
death sentences. DAVID PECCHIA

Regarding Nancy Churnin's article, "Actors Weary of Typecasting, Create 'Latins 
Anonymous,' " Sept. 19, I agree with Luisa Leschin that "Hollywood writers are 
seeing their image of Mexicans as their maids and gardeners." Leschin is one of 
the four members of "Latins Anonymous," a show now being staged in the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if this typecasting is based on prejudice or ignorance, but I do 
know it has been going on since time immemorial. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, every night I watch attractive and well-dressed Hispanic actors and 
actresses playing professional, educated people and living in beautiful homes 
and going to glamorous parties and restaurants. No, not in Hollywood films but 
on the Spanish-language television screens. 
</P>
<P>
The locales are not Los Angeles nor New York, but Caracas, Buenos Aires and 
Mexico City. These series or films are shown not only in the Western Hemisphere 
but in Spain, Italy, China and even in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But Hollywood writers and producers care little or nothing about all this. It 
is a sad and deplorable situation.

FACES . . .: A HEAVENLY ROLE

"Introducing Cheryl Paris as Heavenly," the credits read 48 seconds into 
Sunday's airing of Tennessee Williams' "Sweet Bird of Youth" on NBC. Not a bad 
introduction, considering the preceding names on the bill include Elizabeth 
Taylor, Mark Harmon and Valerie Perrine. "It looks kind of nice," the 
30-year-old Paris says with a bright smile. 
</P>
<P>
In her first audition for the part of the love-torn Heavenly Finley, Paris 
admits she wasn't so cheery. Reading in front of director Nicolas Roeg, the 
strain from Paris' divorce helped the tears rush forth. "When I finished, he 
had one of those looks that I really wasn't sure of. I thought, 'Either I did 
really well or I'm in really big trouble.' " 
</P>
<P>
In dark slacks, white blazer and cowboy boots, Paris sits comfortably, anything 
but a wreck. "I'm a single parent and I believe I'll work," Paris says about 
her acting, but points out that providing for her 6-year-old daughter is her 
first priority. "I don't want to ever say to my daughter, 'No you can't have 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Paris isn't entirely new to the camera. A fashion model for three years in New 
York, she landed her first acting role in a 1981 movie for television and then 
another in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Paris moved to Los Angeles, where she began formal acting lessons. 
"I got with someone in the beginning that really messed me up. When you get 
with a coach that says, 'You can't use that technique because it won't sustain 
that moment,' you believe it." She remembers it took her a long time to 
recapture her natural abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Paris now sees her work coming into focus. "I walk away from a day of shooting 
and say 'Geez, I could have done this,' and I guess that's what the joy of 
acting is about," she says with a smile. "I'm having fun for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Paris knows the realities of parenthood and the uncertainties of the business. 
"It is tremendously overwhelming," she says. Having just finished shooting the 
feature film "So Cool" with Miles O'Keefe, Paris is back auditioning and 
looking for that next part. 
</P>
<P>
"Or it's back to real estate school," she says, half joking. MITCHELL SAM ROSSI

THE STORY BEHIND THE PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your art review of Max Yavno ("Of Muscles and Old Men: Max Yavno's 200 Views," 
Sept. 9) perpetuates the myth that the black-and-white photographs by Yavno and 
others were the result of "waiting patiently for the moment when the atmosphere 
of a locale would crystallize into a single image." 
</P>
<P>
I liked to believe this romantic image until I had the opportunity to talk with 
Yavno at an exhibition of his work in the early 1980s. I asked him if he had, 
indeed, waited until the time was right, the woman thrown in the air, the man 
lifting the child, etc. to take his famous "Muscle Beach" photo you displayed 
on your front page. 
</P>
<P>
Yavno looked at me with disdain. "Are you crazy?" he challenged, irascibly. "I 
took hundreds of pictures that day. I don't even remember taking that specific 
picture. I didn't wait for anything. This was just one of hundreds and it just 
happened to turn out to be good." 
</P>
<P>
So much for fanciful fables.

'NIGHT WALK': TRITE PLOT, LANGUID PERFORMANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Night Walk," a TV movie airing Sunday at 9 p.m. (Channels 2 and 8), offers one 
of the dustiest plots in the book -- police lieutenant falls for gorgeous 
witness he's protecting from hit men -- and doesn't add the slightest wrinkle 
to its underdeveloped formula. Stylistically, though, it's far enough off the 
usual TV track to be slightly above average for the cathode-ray cop genre. 
</P>
<P>
A half-hour into it, it's not quite clear whether lead player Robert Urich is 
turning in a really uninvolved, lethargic, lackluster performance or just 
fitting in with the film's unusually relaxed naturalist style. At the end of 
two hours, we still aren't sure. You might want to give him the benefit of the 
doubt, though, given that writers and executive producers Renee and Harry 
Longstreet have concocted a script full of low-key interchanges in which 
characters have trouble connecting, and Jerrold Freedman has directed it in a 
slow-moving, pause-filled fashion more befitting the European cinema than 
slam-bang prime time. 
</P>
<P>
More care has been given to the often surprisingly witty incidental dialogue 
(Urich, coming home and finding his kids watching soft-core porn, mocks them: 
"Please, Dad, can we have cable? We don't wanna miss all the sports on ESPN, 
and the Disney Channel . . . .") than on fleshing out the undernourished 
thriller elements. 
</P>
<P>
Lesley-Anne Down is the love interest who, while on leave from her nasty 
attorney of a husband, witnesses a murder that seems to have left behind no 
clues -- which doesn't stop two triggermen from trying to gun down her and any 
badge who tries to protect her. Anyone who can't figure out where this is 
headed at least 10 or 20 minutes before it's over probably needs a physical, 
yet the oddly real-time, real-life tone of the film puts an intriguing spin on 
its trip toward inevitability. CHRIS WILLMAN

POP BEAT: INXS' HUTCHENCE REJECTS ROCK STAR IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is what I think of rock stars," said Michael Hutchence, lead singer of 
the Australian band INXS. In a gesture of disgust, he mimed spitting on the 
floor of the elegant pool-side patio at a swank Beverly Hills hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A passing waitress, apparently thinking he had actually spit, looked strangely 
at him as she walked past. "She probably thinks I'm some crude rock star," 
cracked Hutchence, who probably works harder than any other rock figure at not 
being like a star. 
</P>
<P>
When Hutchence was not venting his wrath against his dreaded peers, he was 
explaining why he's working with another Australian band, Max Q, whose first 
album, "Max Q," has just been released on Atlantic Records -- also INXS' label. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the time was spent clearing up misconceptions about Max Q, which plays 
quirky, sociopolitical, cerebral rock that seems to be going in several 
directions at once. It's not the kind of funky, danceable, straight-ahead rock 
INXS is noted for. If it weren't for Hutchence's identifiable vocal style, 
you'd never associate Max Q with INXS. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my new band, I'm still with INXS," Hutchence said. "We'll be 
recording at the end of the year. The Max Q album is something I wrote and 
produced with my friend Ollie Olsen and some other Australian musicians. Max Q 
is a one-shot deal. The band isn't going to tour and doesn't exist beyond this 
album." 
</P>
<P>
The patio, sizzling in the afternoon sun, was empty. If it had been crowded, 
Hutchence would have undoubtedly been recognized -- just like any other 
high-profile rock star. That would have really made him angry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get recognized much, thank God," said Hutchence, 29, who's one of 
those handsome, moody, mercurial types who seem to be a magnet for women. 
"That's because I don't ask for it. Rock stars walk around with an entourage of 
bodyguards, supposedly to protect themselves from the fans. Actually, they're 
looking to be recognized. Rock stars are the saddest people in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"They're neurotic idiots -- jerks. They're adolescents who never grew up. If 
the kids really knew what these people were like, they wouldn't idolize them, 
they'd throw up. These are decadent people. I've lived a more decadent life 
than I've told anybody, but decadence isn't a way of life for me. Rock stars 
are horrible people. Being a street cleaner or a baker are more honorable 
professions." 
</P>
<P>
Max Q came about as the result of Hutchence meeting Olsen during the filming of 
the 1986 Australian movie "Dogs in Space." Hutchence was the star and Olsen the 
musical supervisor. A single from the sound track, "Rooms for the Memory," an 
Olsen composition that Hutchence sings, was a hit in Australia, and they 
decided to work together again later on. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchence didn't have time until earlier this year, following the INXS world 
tour promoting the band's last album, "Kick," a multimillion seller that 
elevated INXS to superstar status. 
</P>
<P>
In Max Q, Hutchence is matched with Olsen and some of his underground rock 
friends -- just the kind of unpredictable and unexpected combination that 
Hutchence relishes. 
</P>
<P>
"Ollie isn't supposed to hang around with pop stars and I'm not supposed to 
hang around with punk types," Hutchence said. "The band is made up of rowdy 
friends from Melbourne. These guys are good musicians who've never had a 
chance. Most of them have never even been in a studio. These are real 
underground people who don't have any money. Some of them have never been on a 
plane before. They were worried that working with me, they'd lose their 
underground status. 
</P>
<P>
"This album is a meeting of the alter egos. Ollie is this underground musician 
living out his pop fantasy. That's his alter ego. I'm getting a chance to do 
something totally different, working with underground musicians. That's my 
alter-ego thing." 
</P>
<P>
Hutchence started the project with his own money, but Atlantic decided to 
release it. According to Hutchence, label executives were skeptical after they 
found out his name wouldn't be part of the title and his picture wouldn't be 
prominently displayed on the album. (The Max Q face on the cover is a composite 
of the faces of the band members). He is barely in the video for the first 
single, "Way of the World." From what Hutchence said, Atlantic's approval of 
the project was, to a large degree, the label indulging one of its biggest 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, before starting the project, he didn't inform the INXS members. 
"I just did it," he said. "I forgot to tell them about it. They were busy doing 
other things. It didn't occur to me. When they found out they might have been a 
little nervous at first. But they found out I'm not looking to tamper with 
INXS. 
</P>
<P>
"And fans shouldn't worry. INXS is safe. Looks like I'll have to be a rock star 
a little while longer."

documentary, "The Great Wall of Iron." This presents the work of two Western 
film crews that were granted unprecedented access to the People's Liberation 
Army in the summer of 1988. The documentary, which will air in one-hour 
installments for the next five Sundays, reveals how the Chinese army lives, 
trains and maneuvers, and purports to provide insight into how and why the 
massacre in Tian An Men Square last June actually occurred.

NUMBER OF STUDIES GROWING;

<P>
MADNESS AND CREATIVITY: SCIENTISTS HUNT FOR LINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For centuries, people have talked about a connection between creativity and 
madness. 
</P>
<P>
Socrates and Winston Churchill, Edgar Allan Poe and F. Scott Fitzgerald, 
Michelangelo and Vincent Van Gogh. They are but a few of the highly creative 
individuals who are known to have suffered from some form of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until two years ago that an American researcher published the 
first scientific article demonstrating, to the satisfaction of scientists, that 
a connection did indeed exist between creativity and mental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Since then a number of other studies have been published. At least three books 
are being written. And now researchers are trying to explore what appears to be 
a genetic link between creativity and mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to unravel the biological and physiological mysteries that surround 
creativity, scientists have found that artists and writers -- especially poets 
and novelists -- are much more prone to mania and depression than the general 
population. Ordinary people who are not necessarily known for their creativity 
but clearly exhibit signs of it have also been found in unusually high numbers 
to suffer from mild cases of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Even more intriguing are recent studies showing that, while many creative 
people have a predilection to mental problems, their relatives appear to be 
even more highly susceptible to severe depressions or crippling manic attacks. 
</P>
<P>
One emerging theory is that creativity may be nature's way of helping 
individuals overcome a genetic predisposition to mental disease. If so, this 
could have profound implications not only on the study of creativity but on the 
practice of psychiatry as well. The research may also pose some knotty ethical 
questions about how to treat mental illness without dampening the creative 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nancy C. Andreasen, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa 
College of Medicine was the first to document the connection between creativity 
and mental illness in a landmark 1987 study. 
</P>
<P>
But she was not the first to notice the connection. Even Aristotle, in ancient 
Greece, had observed it: "(All) of those who have been famous for their genius 
. . . have been inclined to insanity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming a physician, Andreasen was a literary scholar. She couldn't 
help notice the number of suicides among writers. In the 20th Century alone, 
there had been Ernest Hemingway, Sylvia Plath, John Berryman, Anne Sexton, 
Virginia Woolf. 
</P>
<P>
Had these writers been mentally ill? 
</P>
<P>
Or were there simply some similarities between creative people and mentally 
deranged ones? As Roy Thurston, a Los Angeles artist, put it recently: 
"Creativity is being aware of the boundaries and going beyond them. Mental 
illness is just not being aware of boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern Criteria 
</P>
<P>
Unlike earlier research efforts, Andreasen used modern psychiatric diagnostic 
criteria to assess the mental health of creative people. She chose as her 
subjects 30 faculty members at the University of Iowa's Writers' Workshop, the 
country's oldest and one of its most notable writing schools. 
</P>
<P>
What Andreasen had expected to find when she began her work in the 1970s was a 
slightly higher than normal incidence of schizophrenia. To her surprise, the 
writers she studied did not exhibit the symptoms she expected -- delusions, 
hallucinations, bizarre thoughts and the loss of sense of self. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of schizophrenia, 80% of them exhibited depression or had some other 
form of mood disorder. Only 30% of a control group of non-writers suffered from 
mood disorders. Nearly half of the writers -- 43% -- were diagnosed as having 
one of the most serious forms of mood disorders -- manic depression -- compared 
to a rate of 10% among the control subjects. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst cases, patients suffered episodes of uncontrollable hyperactivity, 
often accompanied by grandiose delusions and long periods of incapacitating and 
often suicidal depression. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Andreasen warned that her findings, while statistically 
significant, were not necessarily relevant to other types of creativity. But 
last spring her observations were bolstered by a study involving writers and 
artists conducted by Kay Redfield Jamison, an associate professor of psychiatry 
at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison analyzed the work patterns and mental health status of 47 of England's 
most highly honored poets, novelists, playwrights, artists and biographers. 
More than a third, she found, had sought treatment for mental-health problems 
-- a rate about 30 times that of the general population. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most revealing patterns that emerged from the British study was the 
sharp contrast between those writers who dealt in fiction and those who dealt 
with fact. 
</P>
<P>
While about a third of the poets and novelists reported having either severe 
mood swings or extended, elated mood states, none of the biographers reported 
significant shifts in mood. A handful of the biographers had taken 
anti-depressants at some time in their lives, but they did not seem subjected 
to what Jamison calls the "creative fire" that was reported by so many of the 
others in the study. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, scientists do not seem to be as prone to mental illness as do other 
creative people, perhaps because of the more rigid nature of scientific 
research, which requires at least some measure of stability and predictability. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have yet to be any systematic studies, Jamison believes that 
truly gifted political and corporate leaders may have mental disorders and mood 
patterns similar to those of poets and artists. 
</P>
<P>
Truly gifted leaders, Jamison said, tend to share many of the characteristics 
that are exhibited by manics: high energy, enthusiasm, intense emotions, 
charisma, gregariousness, extroversion, self-aggrandizement, optimism, 
heightened alertness, fearlessness, decisiveness, sleeplessness. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been "relatively few overtly psychotic political and 
military leaders," she says, there have been any of a number who would surely 
be diagnosed as having some form of abnormal swings in moods. Oliver Cromwell, 
Napoleon Bonaparte, Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Theodore Roosevelt, Winston 
Churchill and Benito Mussolini all suffered from some form of mood disorder, 
Jamison said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ruth Richards, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard University and a 
researcher at the Mailman Research Center at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., 
has also been working in this field. Details of her work, which is the result 
of a collaboration with her colleague Dennis K. Kinney, is also scheduled to be 
published shortly in a book titled "Creativity and the Healthy Mind." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everyday Creativity' 
</P>
<P>
Rather than studying famous people and trying to assess their mental states, 
Richards and Kinney have taken a different tack. They have been trying to 
identify individuals and families with a history of mental disease and then 
assess their levels of creativity. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, the researchers evaluated what they call "everyday creativity." 
Without revealing precisely what it was they were looking for, the researchers 
asked a group of subjects detailed questions about work patterns and leisure 
habits. People who tended to do things in imaginative, unusual ways scored high 
on the scales of everyday creativity. Those who worked or played in predictable 
ways scored low. For example, an auto mechanic who was especially clever in 
solving problems and who designed his own tools or invented new uses for old 
tools would receive a very high rating, whereas a painter, even a gifted one, 
who simply made copies of originals would get a rather low score. 
</P>
<P>
Using these scales, Richards and Kinney have found some intriguing connections 
between creativity and mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
It was not those with extreme cases of manic depression who tended to be the 
most creative. Rather, it was the relatives of those who were mentally ill -- 
people who themselves exhibited only mild signs of mental illness or, in some 
cases, no symptoms -- who were the most creative. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers had already determined that manic depression seemed to be a 
genetically inherited characteristic, passed along in families from one 
generation to the next. Maybe, Richards theorized, there were similar genetic 
or biological predispositions for creativity. And just maybe, creativity and 
manic depression were somehow linked, so that a person who was susceptible to 
mental illness was also predisposed to creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Such genetic links seemed to exist elsewhere in nature. For example, scientists 
had long wondered why sickle cell anemia, which is such a debilitating and 
often fatal disease, didn't die off with its victims long ago. The reason, they 
now believe, is that, for some reason, this devastating form of anemia seems to 
be genetically coupled to an immunity to malaria. As a result, individuals who 
are not stricken with sickle cell but are merely carriers of it are also 
blessed with a much-needed immunity to malaria, which has long been one of the 
most pervasive and virulent diseases facing the human population. 
</P>
<P>
Just as an immunity to malaria seems to offer a kind of "compensatory 
advantage" for the carriers of sickle cell, Richards said, so creativity may be 
a form of compensation for those who are carriers of the genes that predispose 
individuals to mental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent connection between mental illness and creativity raises complex 
medical and ethical issues, which scientists have not even begun to resolve, 
said Jamison in a chapter on creativity in a forthcoming medical text published 
by Oxford University Press. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, psychiatrists and psychologists have treated manic depression 
with medication and psychotherapy and, in so doing, ignored the potentially 
creative aspects of the manic stages of the disease, which they viewed as 
destructive. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are moving closer to being able to identify the genetic markers for 
mental illness. This means they soon will be able to spot fetuses and even 
recently conceived embryos that are at a high risk of mental disease, in much 
the same way that Down's syndrome, spina bifida, Tay-Sachs disease and other 
devastating genetic abnormalities are identified by such simple medical 
procedures as amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling. 
</P>
<P>
This leads Richards and other experts to wondering if, in trying to dull the 
pain of mental illness, scientists might inadvertently destroy its beneficial 
side effects.

JURY TOOK ZSA ZSA WITH 'GRAIN OF SALT'; 
</P>
<P>
GABOR FOUND GUILTY OF SLAPPING POLICE OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL and DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was convicted Friday of slapping a motorcycle officer, 
driving without a valid driver's license and having an open container of 
alcohol in her $215,000 Rolls-Royce convertible when she was stopped while 
driving in Beverly Hills on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery former Miss Hungary, whose outspoken comments outside of court led to 
a $500 fine for contempt of court, was found not guilty of disobeying Officer 
Paul Kramer when she drove away from him after a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated more than 10 hours over three days in reaching their 
verdicts after a 15-day trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have been surprised if I wasn't found guilty," Gabor told reporters on the 
courthouse steps. "I have expected it all along." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe that in a country as great as ours that a 6-foot-4 policeman 
can beat up a lady of 5-foot-4 and use dirty language as if she was a 
streetwalker. I think Russia can't be worse or Communist Hungary, either. I 
think it's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
As for going to jail, she said, "That would be wonderful. I'd have time to 
write my book." 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to jail, Bistro Gardens (a restaurant) said they would serve me food 
three times a day." 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Charles Rubin set sentencing for Oct. 17. Gabor faces a maximum 
penalty of 18 months in jail and a $3,500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman John Burke, 35, an accountant from Los Angeles, said he felt the 
panel made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
"She got a message from us about how we feel about her driving about town 
committing battery on a police officer," Burke said. "I feel good about our 
decision. I'm glad that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Burke said the jurors decided to acquit the blonde actress on a charge of 
driving away from Kramer because they believed she could have misinterpreted an 
obscene comment he allegedly made to her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contradictory Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Juror Kathy Hudson, 30, a bank teller who lives in Los Angeles, noted that 
testimony presented during the trial was contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody (the jury) basically took everything with a grain a salt," said 
Hudson, referring to Gabor's testimony. "There were an awful lot of 
contradictions. She would say one thing and later something completely 
contradictory." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was wearing an orange-and-black print dress and a diamond brooch when she 
arrived at the courthouse shortly before 3 p.m. in her Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I'm nervous, Jesus," she told a crush of TV cameras and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, she seemed excited and chatted with about 70 spectators, 
likening the scene to "opening night on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
As the court clerk read the first guilty verdict, she sighed, "Ahhh." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's lawyer, William Graysen, said his client will decide whether to appeal 
after she is sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Elden Fox commented that the judge had been "clearly deferential" to 
Gabor during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"He was allowing her to walk in and out of the courtroom," Fox said. "If she 
wanted to have a break, an aspirin, if she wanted a rest, these were allowed." 
</P>
<P>
Fox said he offered Gabor a plea bargain before the trial, but she rejected it 
through her attorney. The deal would have permitted the actress to plead guilty 
to one count of disturbing the peace on condition that she publicly apologize 
to the police. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Gabor grew out of an confrontation with Kramer after the 
motorcycle officer stopped the actress for driving her car with expired 
registration tags. While Kramer was checking for other violations, Gabor drove 
off. 
</P>
<P>
When Kramer pulled her over the second time, Gabor slapped the officer. She 
claimed that she had acted in self-defense when Kramer pulled her out of her

CONFEREES AGREE TO BAN FUNDING FOR 'OBSCENE' ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senate and House negotiators agreed Friday on a compromise that would prohibit 
federal funding of "obscene" art but would reject a much broader ban covering 
works deemed "indecent" or "denigrating." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders were uncertain whether the full membership of the House and the Senate 
would accept the proposal, which scaled down substantially a Senate-passed ban 
sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
Some thought that the compromise might go through next week, while others said 
they expect further controversy over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan emerged hours after the Senate had dealt a pair of resounding 
setbacks to Helms, a maverick whose disruptive tactics have annoyed many 
colleagues, although gaining him a wide following among ultraconservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Helms, riding a wave of grass-roots protests against funding of works by Robert 
Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano, had won Senate adoption two months ago of an 
amendment placing broad restrictions on arts funding by the National Endowment 
for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment would have blocked spending for "obscene or indecent" materials 
depicting sexual activity or the exploitation of children, materials that 
"denigrate" a particular religion or nonreligion and material that "denigrates, 
debases or reviles" persons on the basis of race, creed, sex, handicap, age or 
national origin. 
</P>
<P>
But early Friday, the Senate rejected, 62 to 35, Helms' attempt to pressure 
Senate negotiators to back the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
When Helms sought later to pare the ban to cover "obscene" or "indecent" works, 
the Senate voted, 65 to 31, to embrace a substitute offered by Sens. Wyche 
Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.) and Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.) that would prohibit funding 
only of "obscene" art. 
</P>
<P>
Helms complained that dropping the word "indecent" would leave "a loophole to 
people who want to continue to abuse" the use of tax dollars. Fowler countered 
that "indecent" was unconstitutionally vague and that his language adhered to a 
U.S. Supreme Court decision banning obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, said in interviews that they reversed 
field and scaled down the original Helms amendment for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An unusually informative and well-attended debate persuaded them that the 
comprehensive ban went too far in restricting citizens' First Amendment rights 
to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Helms' middle-of-the-night attempt to pressure Senate conferees was an 
insulting challenge to their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was an irresistible opportunity to take a swipe at Helms, whose national 
political organization has used many Senate votes on moral and patriotic issues 
as ammunition in election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some senators who voted to throw out the entire Helms 
amendment acknowledged that they had felt politically obliged to vote later for 
the Fowler-Rudman ban on "obscene" art. That way, they hoped to be able to 
please a wide range of voters back home -- supporting free speech on the one 
hand while opposing pornography on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) was scornful of the Fowler-Rudman plan, which he 
voted against as too limited. "It was supposed to provide some political cover 
for people who voted no (on the Helms amendment), lest they be accused of 
promoting obscenity and sexual exploitation of children in the guise of art." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who 
supported Fowler-Rudman as an alternative to Helms, smiled and said: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said the debate Friday, which included attacks on the Helms amendment by 
Republican moderates John C. Danforth of Missouri, Slade Gorton of Washington 
and Rudman, "really showed that an attempt to ban depictions offensive to a 
religion or non-religion were not only constitutionally vague but could have 
unintended consequences. It could have affected books on Judaism offensive to 
Christians and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he contended, Helms' proposed ban on "denigrating" materials based on 
gender "knocks out all literature. Not a book has been written that is not 
offensive to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic senator who asked not to be identified said that "we really rolled 
Jesse. I didn't think we would have the courage to say no to him, but we just 
got tired of these votes that are designed for TV spots and campaign 
materials." 
</P>
<P>
A Republican senator who also requested anonymity said: "This had to do with 
Jesse's style and history of mischief. If somebody else had proposed the broad 
ban, there would have been a very different result." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) said he and others voted to cut back the Helms 
ban because parts of it were "too vague to be enforced. They would create a 
great deal of controversy and many court challenges. Obscenity is clearly 
defined (by the Supreme Court) as being outside of community standards." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Terry Sanford (D-N.C.) said Helms had been defeated in part because his 
effort to pressure conferees "went against the Senate's long-standing procedure 
of having confidence in its conferees. You've got to give them freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Besides narrowing the ban, the conference agreement chastised the NEA for 
funding the Mapplethorpe and Serrano works. It also called for a commission to 
study how federal arts aid is distributed and whether new standards should be 
set for works to qualify for government funds. 
</P>
<P>
A series of photographs by Mapplethorpe depicted homoerotic and sadomasochistic 
acts. A photo by Serrano depicted a crucifix in a bottle of urine. 
</P>
<P>
Anne C. Murphy, lobbying against a funding ban on behalf of writers and 
artists, said that her American Arts Alliance reluctantly supported the 
compromise. It is not what she wanted, she said, "but my name is not Dorothy 
and I'm not in Oz. I have to deal with the reality of all these worlds." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Senate confirmed on a unanimous voice vote the 
nomination of Portland, Ore., attorney John E. Frohnmayer as new chairman of 
the National Endowment of the Arts. Frohnmayer, who is expected to take over 
his new duties within the next two weeks, will be in Washington on Tuesday for 
a White House lunch with President Bush.

ZSA ZSA GABOR CONVICTED OF SLAPPING POLICE OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL and EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strange, oftentimes uproarious Zsa Zsa Gabor trial was handed over to 
posterity on Friday, with a jury convicting the actress of slapping a police 
officer, driving without a license and possessing an open container of alcohol 
-- a flask of Jack Daniels -- in her $215,000 Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
But the tempestuous Hungarian was acquitted of disobeying Beverly Hills Police 
Officer Paul Kramer when she drove away from a routine traffic stop on June 14. 
Jurors found that the action -- which led to a pursuit followed by an 
altercation and arrest -- may have resulted from nothing more than 
miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, wearing a bold, orange-and-black print dress, appeared excited and 
nervous as she arrived at Beverly Hills Municipal Court for the misdemeanor 
verdicts, which came after 14 hours of jury deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
She gasped aloud when the first guilty verdict was read, but seemed to show no 
other reaction until she exited the courtroom, smiling once, with her husband, 
Prince Frederick von Anhalt of Germany. Outside, she faced a 
bumping-and-shoving crowd of two dozen TV news cameras and more than 50 members 
of an international press corps, and she lashed out at the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed. I can't believe it," Gabor said, moments before the premises 
were cleared because of a bomb threat. "I can't believe that in a country as 
great as ours that a 6-foot-4 policeman can beat up a lady of 5-foot-4 and use 
dirty language as if she was a street walker. I think Russia can't be worse, or 
communist Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how she felt about the prospects of jail, she said: "That would be 
wonderful. I'd have time to write my book. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to jail, Bistro Gardens (a restaurant) said they would serve me food 
three times a day." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's sentencing was set for Oct. 17. Although the convictions carry total 
maximum penalties of 18 months in jail and about $3,000 in fines, Gabor is 
unlikely to do jail time because of her nearly clean record and contributions 
to charity and show business, predicted her attorney, William Graysen. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox, who sparred repeatedly with Gabor during her 
time on the witness stand, was evasive about whether he would seek a jail 
sentence, saying he was "contemplating" many possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Expect Jail Time' 
</P>
<P>
"She was convinced that there was no reason for these traffic laws to be 
enforced because she was Zsa Zsa Gabor," Fox said. "If you or I slapped a 
police officer, we would expect jail time." 
</P>
<P>
Fox noted, however, that Gabor's age -- reportedly 66 -- will be considered in 
her sentencing, as well as her history with the law. "There is a prior record," 
he added. "She was convicted in Britain of hitting a police officer with a 
pocketbook. She was fined $5,000." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors, who began deliberating Wednesday, said they struggled with the barrage 
of conflicting and dubious testimony. At one point, a juror said, they became 
almost hopelessly deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody (on the jury) basically took everything with a grain of salt," said 
juror Kathy Hudson, 30, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Contradictions' 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's own testimony, in which she accused police of doctoring videotapes made 
after her arrest, was filled with "an awful lot of contradictions," Hudson 
said. "She insisted she never swore. Then, when we looked at those 
(videotapes), there she was . . . her language was bluer than Officer Kramer's 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
Proceedings in the three-week trial -- which cost taxpayers an estimated 
$30,000 -- seemed at times almost surreal, as if the participants were part of 
a Marx Brothers movie. At one point, Judge Charles G. Rubin halted arguments to 
admonish Gabor, an amateur artist, not to sketch jury members. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, she was at work on portraits of her dogs. 
</P>
<P>
One witness told a long and compelling story about his alleged difficulties 
with Officer Kramer in a previous case. But when a different officer -- not 
Kramer, but an Officer Crawford -- was paraded into the courtroom, the witness 
eagerly nodded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cast of Witnesses 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, that's him." Said Gabor's embarrassed attorney: "No further questions." 
</P>
<P>
The cast of witnesses featured three self-professed dyslexics, including 
screenwriter David Katzman, who estimated the width of six-lane Olympic 
Boulevard at 15 feet. Katzman stood near a blown-up street map and attempted 
three times to illustrate the complex route by which his car arrived at the 
scene of the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 20 minutes, he had produced a set of lines and arrows that 
resembled a stereo schematic, with his own car and Gabor's car facing opposite 
directions on the wrong sides of the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, Mr. Katzman is not a map maker," Gabor's attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Kevin Goodman, a Los Angeles attorney, said jurors "could never agree on 
whether Ms. Gabor got out of the car on her own or if she was pulled out of the 
car" by Kramer just before slapping him. But in the end, Goodman said, jurors 
who believed that Kramer pulled Gabor out of the car decided that he had the 
right to do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acquitted on 1 Charge 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman John Burke, 35, an accountant, said the jury acquitted Gabor on 
the charge of disobeying an officer because it was possible she heard only the 
word "leave" when Kramer told her, "Don't leave" during the first traffic stop. 
Kramer stopped her after spotting expired registration tags. 
</P>
<P>
"She got a message from us about how we feel about her driving around town 
committing battery on a police officer," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Police Lt. Jim Smith expressed pleasure with the ruling, 
commenting, "Everybody's feeling vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide publicity over the slap, as well as Gabor's daily antics, seemed to 
create a frenzy of interest in the case. Eccentricity seemed to run amok. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a mock fight in the court building between a Zsa Zsa Gabor 
impersonator and a man in a "Hang Zsa Zsa" T-shirt provoked wild laughter from 
bystanders and stern criticism from Gabor's daughter, Francesca Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Miss Demeanor' 
</P>
<P>
One TV broadcaster predicted a new line of Zsa Zsa perfume: "Miss Demeanor . . 
. slap it on, it assaults your senses." 
</P>
<P>
And Trond Woxen, 46, who called himself "The Mad Poet" of Beverly Hills, gave a 
reading of his 16-verse account of the incident: "Winding up just as quick as a 
pitcher with ball/And a blazingly snappy release/She slapped the face of 
Officer Paul/Of the Beverly Hills Police. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of it all, Gabor appeared anything but penitent -- or unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she planned to do, she said: "I'm going home to collapse in my 
swimming pool." 
</P>
<P>
With that, she stepped back into her Rolls-Royce and rode away.

PTL EMPIRE WAS 'VISION FROM GOD,' BAKKER TESTIFIES; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER EVANGELIST DEFENDS 'PARTNERSHIP' SCHEME, BLAMES MEDIA AND DEVIL FOR 
DOWNFALL

<P>
Defrocked evangelist Jim Bakker, testifying for the first time in his fraud and 
conspiracy trial, said Friday that the fallen PTL empire originated with a 
vision from God and the former TV preacher's own "need to serve people." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was almost born with this vision in my heart," Bakker said 
quietly, under questioning from his attorney, George T. Davis. "I felt God 
spoke to me (and told me) to build a Christian center for people." 
</P>
<P>
Later, under cross-examination by prosecutor Deborah Smith, Bakker blamed the 
media, the devil and his betrayal by aides for the downfall of his 
multimillion-dollar empire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Devil Caused Problems' 
</P>
<P>
"I would say, yes, I think the devil caused a lot of problems," Bakker said. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker is scheduled to resume testifying on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As his trial nears its end, the one-time evangelist is trying to convince 
jurors that he is a sincere, God-fearing man who was misled and mistreated but 
intended no harm. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, charge that he used television and the mails to sell 
unsuspecting supporters "partnerships" to spend three nights at the nearby 
Heritage USA Christian theme park even when he knew he had not built enough 
rooms for them. 
</P>
<P>
As Bakker does battle inside the Charles R. Jonas Federal Building and 
Courthouse, a sideshow takes place outside, including a radio station that 
gives away caps to anybody who puts his head under a couch placed under a 
stately magnolia tree. (Bakker reportedly put his head under a couch when he 
broke down and cried, suffering what a psychiatrist called "a panic attack" 
earlier in the trial.) 
</P>
<P>
Also, a group of Florida supporters marches in front of the courthouse singing 
hymns and carrying petitions for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker, 49, is charged with 24 counts of mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. 
According to the government, he and close aides in the PTL ministry that he 
founded not only oversold the partnerships but also diverted more than $3.7 
million of the PTL money to pay for their huge bonuses and sumptuous life 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the trial has been devoted to a battle between "partners" who testified 
for the prosecution and those who appeared for the defense. Typically, the 
partnerships cost $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors' witnesses, many of whom were on fixed incomes, asserted that they 
were turned down for reservations, while a succession of defense witnesses 
testified that they were satisfied givers to PTL, which stands for People That 
Love and Praise the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
The once-charismatic evangelist faces up to 120 years in prison and fines of $5 
million if the jury of six men and six women convicts him. 
</P>
<P>
Three of his former associates already have been sentenced in the case. Richard 
Dortch, who pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy, was sentenced to eight 
years; David Taggart was sentenced to 18 years, 5 months, and Taggart's brother 
James to 17 years, 9 months -- both on tax evasion convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's appearance, on the 21st day of trial, is a defense gamble on his 
persuasive skills. As Seth Langson, a local attorney, put it: "He takes pride 
in persuading the masses. This is his ultimate test." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a dark suit and wearing glasses, Bakker usually addressed the jury 
when questioned by his own lawyer, but, when Smith took over, he faced her, and 
sometimes was so feisty that she had to ask him to let her finish a question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Does Not Remember 
</P>
<P>
Many times when she asked him about seemingly incriminating testimony or 
evidence, such as computer printouts, Bakker said he did not remember it or did 
not believe it. And he often asserted that documents signed in his name were 
not actually signed by him. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people sign my name," he said when denying that he approved a bonus 
for Taggart. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an accountant," Bakker said defiantly at one point, explaining that he 
does not understand finance. 
</P>
<P>
Smith several times noted Bakker's huge salary and bonuses, contrasting them 
with low-paid employees he laid off after a 1986 meeting in Palm Springs. 
Bakker countered that, even if he had given up his $500,000 annual salary, it 
would have run PTL for only a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not remember a 1984 bonus of $390,000, half of which went for a 
down payment on a Palm Desert home. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bakker did say that "if I had it to do all over again, I would not 
have allowed the (PTL) board" to pay him such large bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Under the gentle guidance of courtly, 82-year-old Davis, Bakker unfolded the 
history of his career as an evangelist, discussed the challenges of creating 
the PTL empire and asserted that he had a plan that would accommodate all the 
partners who wanted lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
"The vision from God was to build a modern Christian campground" for people to 
worship at, he said. "In the middle of the night I woke up. It was a dream or a 
vision; I don't know. I began to write down the concept of lifetime 
partnerships." 
</P>
<P>
Television would be the way to sell them. Bakker said: "Television is the most 
powerful medium in the world today, and the most important message, the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, should be propagated over the medium." 
</P>
<P>
But the demands were powerful, too, he said. "You never get away from the 
pressure that you have to raise funds for the next week, the next month, the 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's PTL empire -- at one time taking in more than $100 million a year -- 
crumbled rapidly after former church secretary Jessica Hahn disclosed their 
1980 tryst. Bakker resigned from the ministry in 1987, the year PTL declared 
bankruptcy. Bakker is alleged to have paid Hahn money to hush up the affair.

<P>
CONDITIONS FOR EAST GERMANS AT EMBASSY CALLED INHUMANE 
</P>

<P>
As concern mounted Friday over the fate of nearly 3,000 East Germans who have 
taken refuge in the West German Embassy in Prague, West German officials 
appealed to the Czechoslovak government to provide living quarters "befitting 
human beings" for the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Czechoslovak authorities were said to be debating whether to 
provide facilities outside the embassy compound for the growing number of East 
Germans trying to flee to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, West German sources said indoor facilities might be made available 
for refugees already in the embassy in Prague -- if an agreement on this 
excludes additional East German refugees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Serious' 
</P>
<P>
A Czechoslovak government spokesman, Miroslav Pavel, conceded that conditions 
at the embassy are "very serious." He said his government was considering a 
positive response to the West German appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the West German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, called on 
the Czechoslovak government to avoid "a human tragedy" by providing temporary 
quarters for East Germans who have been climbing over a back wall into the 
embassy grounds, unimpeded by the Prague police. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, government spokesman Hans Klein said the Czechoslovak government could 
perform a humanitarian service by establishing quarters for the East Germans, 
who have been living in tents on the rain-soaked embassy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"At this hour," he told a news conference, "the issue is to provide a minimum 
of accommodation befitting human beings for the refugees in the embassy 
grounds, among them hundreds of small children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pragmatic Solution' 
</P>
<P>
Bonn, he said, will continue to push for a "pragmatic humanitarian solution" 
that would allow the refugees "eventually to emigrate to West Germany as they 
wish." 
</P>
<P>
Pavel, the Czechoslovak spokesman, said his government is facing a problem of 
public order. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak radio said the government is trying to deal with the situation "in 
a spirit of humanitarian cooperation and fulfillment of conventional 
obligations which we concluded with East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak government is caught in the middle of the refugee crisis, as 
the Polish government is and as the Hungarian government was earlier. They want 
to keep on good terms with West Germany because of its financial aid and trade, 
and also with East Germany because they are all members of the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary solved its problem earlier this month by allowing all East Germans 
there who wished to go to the West to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia and Poland have not made such a decision, however -- although it 
may be forced upon them because of the growing crisis among the refugees.

<P>
About 600 East Germans are in the West German Embassy in Warsaw. The Polish 
government has allowed some East Germans to take shelter in a Roman Catholic 
hostel at the edge of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past few days, Wolfgang Vogel, a special East Berlin emissary, has 
promised East German refugees in Prague and Warsaw that they will be allowed to 
emigrate officially in six months or so but that first they must return to 
their homes. Only about 200 of the East Germans in Prague and 50 in Warsaw have 
decided to go home. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials say it is clear that more have not heeded Vogel's words 
because they do not believe that their Communist government will keep its word. 
</P>
<P>
According to Irmgard Adam-Schwaetzer, a Foreign Ministry official who flew to 
Prague to inspect the scene, there is not much West Germany can do about the 
East Germans' perception. 
</P>
<P>
She said, "I don't think it is the job of the Federal Republic (West Germany) 
to convince people of the credibility of a government they turned their backs 
on." 
</P>
<P>
But West German spokesman Klein pointed out that some of the 350 East Germans 
who left the West German mission in East Berlin earlier this month have been 
given exit documents by the Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, East Berlin dealt with serious dissenters by banishing them to 
West Germany. But the number of people who are unhappy with life in East 
Germany and are seeking exit papers has risen dramatically this year. More than 
100,000 East Germans have left, with or without authorization, according to 
West German officials. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Egon Bahr, a leading member of the opposition Social Democratic Party 
who has been in favor of close relations with East Germany, said Friday that 
"something terrible is happening when tens of thousands of people pull up their 
roots, leave their homes and leave their relatives behind because they think 
they have to use this chance."

A feared paramilitary force that once helped suppress the Solidarity movement 
will be disbanded, Poland's Interior Ministry announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The move came less than a month after the new prime minister, former Solidarity 
activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, formed the East Bloc's first government that is 
not controlled by Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the ZOMO riot police force, 
which wears helmets and high black-leather boots and carries shields and 
batons, will be disbanded to save money and remove an "irritation" to society. 
</P>
<P>
ZOMO will be replaced by special "preventive patrol units" of the civic 
militia, as the police force is called, to be established in 22 of Poland's 49 
provinces, the state PAP news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry spokesman Wojciech Garstka said the power to deploy police 
will be reserved for the prime minister, a government presidium or the interior 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
ZOMO, formed in 1956, developed a reputation as a brutish enforcer and was 
especially active after martial law was declared in December, 1981. It is 
believed to have at least 12,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz told Parliament of moves by 
the new government to reshape the ailing, centrally planned industries set up 
under communism. 
</P>
<P>
Poland, he said, will work toward creating "a modern market economy" along 
Western capitalist lines. 
</P>
<P>
Balcerowicz said the main task is to slash inflation by limiting excessive wage 
increases and cutting state subsidies. He predicted that this program will 
"unavoidably bring about troubles in the functioning of enterprises and 
bankruptcies." However, he said it is the only way to win approval for loans 
from international lenders to rebuild the economy.

CHINA'S PARTY CHIEF PREDICTS A 'BRIGHT COMMUNIST FUTURE'

<P>
Chinese Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, in a hard-line address Friday, 
predicted "a bright Communist future for mankind." 
</P>
<P>
"The socialist system possesses strong historical vitality and great 
viability," Jiang told 10,000 selected officials and Beijing residents gathered 
at the Great Hall of the People for the start of weekend National Day 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who have noticed only some adverse currents and failed to see the 
irreversible course of history are politically shortsighted observers. 
Socialism replacing capitalism is the real mainstream of history." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang conceded that in China there are strong forces advocating the dismantling 
of socialism and the transformation of China into a capitalist democracy. He 
described this conflict as "a serious class struggle that concerns the life and 
death of our party, state and nation." 
</P>
<P>
This domestic political conflict, he said, involves "two completely different 
views" as to the true meaning of China's decade-old policies of market-oriented 
reforms and opening to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
One view, he said, holds that "reform and opening" refers to the 
"self-improvement of the socialist system" under Communist Party rule. The 
other "is the stand of those who demand 'total Westernization.' " 
</P>
<P>
He said that such "so-called reform and opening constitutes transformation into 
capitalism and brings China into the orbit of the capitalist system of the 
West." 
</P>
<P>
The two viewpoints "stand in diametric opposition," Jiang said, and added that 
"it can be said that this contrast is reflected, to a great extent, in the 
problem of whether or not in the reform and opening we persist in the 
orientation of socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China should permanently maintain a mixed economy dominated by 
public ownership and regulated by a combination of central planning and market 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warns of Economic Dangers 
</P>
<P>
"If we persist in weakening and totally negate the planned economy, and try to 
create a completely market-oriented economy," he said, "it wouldn't work in 
China and would surely throw the economy and the entire society into 
confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang was appointed to the post of Communist Party general secretary in late 
June, replacing the ousted reformist Zhao Ziyang, who was accused of supporting 
last spring's student-led pro-democracy protests. Zhao had also advocated rapid 
and extensive steps toward a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Jiang's 75-minute, nationally televised speech, his first major public 
address since replacing Zhao, consisted of a broad outline of how China's 
leaders now intend to balance different features of the economy. He included 
defense of market-oriented reforms that already been undertaken in the past 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The various policies and measures on reform and opening announced by the party 
Central Committee and the State Council, including the basic policies and 
measures for the Special Economic Zones and the open areas along the coast, 
should be further implemented and perfected in practice," he said. Special 
Economic Zones are the places where market forces have been given the freest 
rein. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang endorsed "the beneficial and necessary supplementary role of the 
individual economy, the private economy, Chinese-foreign joint ventures, 
cooperative enterprises and foreign-owned enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean, he said, "in any way weakening or eliminating the 
position of public ownership as the main sector, much less do we want to 
'privatize' our economy." 
</P>
<P>
The term "socialist reform" means making necessary economic, political and 
ideological adjustments to China's present system to make it more effective, 
Jiang said. Economic growth will depend largely on better education, more 
effective use of scientific and technical knowledge and increased labor 
productivity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang pledged that China will "respect all foreign governments and friends who 
practice equality in their contacts with China, and we will continue to develop 
and expand friendly cooperation with them."

MANILA REACTS QUIETLY TO MARCOS' BURIAL BAN

<P>
As buses and trucks poured thick fumes into the muggy night air and lightning 
crackled overhead, Manolito Perio stood crying beside seven flickering candles 
and a dog-eared portrait of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
"Cory Aquino is not my president," the 37-year-old jeepney driver said, wiping 
tears from his face. "Ferdinand Marcos is still my president. He will always be 
my president." 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 equally fervent Marcos supporters gathered quietly with Perio 
in a candlelight vigil Friday night outside Camp Crame, the national 
constabulary headquarters, but they were the exception the day after the 
72-year-old deposed leader's death in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rallies Fail to Materialize 
</P>
<P>
At least four separate announced rallies and marches to protest President 
Corazon Aquino's ban on burying Marcos in the Philippines failed to 
materialize. Instead, most Manila residents reacted to the news with sympathy, 
relief or indifference. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about Marcos," said Josie Bocateja, a 25-year-old waitress. "Now 
he is dead. That is the end of Marcos for me." 
</P>
<P>
Although hard-core supporters said they would keep the vigil and organize 
protests until Marcos' body is returned, the former president's older brother, 
Dr. Pacifico Marcos, said he expects his brother to be buried "in a few days or 
so" in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the body of their 95-year-old mother, Josefa, which has lain 
in a glass-topped casket for 16 months at the family home in Batac, 230 miles 
north of Manila, will be now be laid to rest. The family had refused to bury 
the embalmed corpse until the exiled Marcos could return. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother's body will be buried in a few days or so, and my mother's body 
will also be buried, probably on the same day," a red-eyed Dr. Marcos said 
after a special morning Mass at the Santuario de San Jose Church in suburban 
Manila. About 200 mourners, including several former Marcos cabinet members, 
offered condolences and prayers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversy Over Burial 
</P>
<P>
The emotional and politically charged question of where Marcos, who ruled this 
Roman Catholic nation of 60 million people for two decades, will be buried is 
making him as controversial in death as in life. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, who took office after a "people power" uprising forced Marcos to flee 
to Hawaii in February, 1986, said Friday that she has "forgiven" Marcos for his 
abuses, but repeated her refusal to let him be buried in Philippine soil. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that allowing the remains of the late president to be brought back 
here would cause some instability and would discourage very much investors and 
tourists from coming here, plus also dividing the people," she said at a news 
conference at Malacanang Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino ordered flags on government buildings lowered to half-staff for three 
days and met with her security advisers and military officials to discuss the 
situation. Security was tightened at radio and TV stations, power plants, 
telephone exchanges and other key installations in the Manila area. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's government has accused Marcos and his wife of stealing up to $5 
billion before he was ousted. Legal problems in the Philippines and in 
Switzerland have prevented the government from recovering most of the money, 
but Mateo Caparas, head of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, said 
he hopes that "cronies" who were afraid of talking while Marcos was alive will 
come forward now "for the sake of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filipinos Evenly Split 
</P>
<P>
Aquino said recent surveys showed Filipinos almost evenly split on the question 
of allowing Marcos to return. "It is really a very divisive issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with several dozen Manila residents made that division clear Friday. 
In Lederiza, one of Manila's largest and oldest slums, Electa Dorimon, 39, sat 
in her one-room dirt-floored home and said it was the final injustice for 
Marcos to be buried in exile. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a Filipino, not an American," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Iris Reyes, 23 and unemployed, agreed. "This is his country," she said. "He 
should be buried in his hometown." 
</P>
<P>
But others in the muddy warren of tin-roofed shanties were nervous. Lito Cruz, 
a 40-year-old office worker, warned that "something bad will happen" if Marcos' 
body is returned. "I feel for him, but I am afraid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Trouble' Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Amy Gutierrez, 24 and unemployed, said "it's better" to keep Marcos' body in 
Hawaii. "If he comes back, you know what will happen," she said. "Trouble. Big 
trouble. The Marcos loyalists will make big trouble for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Some loyalists promised trouble if the body is not returned. "We are the silent 
majority and we are not making any trouble," Neil Punagan, a 30-year-old 
engineer, said angrily at the evening vigil. "But if Mr. Marcos is not allowed 
home, then there will be trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Although Marcos left a legacy of poverty, plundering and martial law, many 
complained that Aquino's government is no better. "It's just the same game with 
a different set of players," said Reggie Aspiras, a 21-year-old student at 
Assumption College.

ANTI-ABORTION LEADER GUILTY OF TRESPASSING

Anti-abortion leader Randall Terry was found guilty Friday of criminal trespass 
and unlawful assembly for leading a protest at an abortion clinic during the 
Democratic National Convention here last year. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, director of New York-based Operation Rescue, handled his own defense 
during a turbulent four-day trial in which the presiding judge frequently 
admonished several dozen anti-abortion activists who packed the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentencing Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
Terry, whose sentencing is scheduled for Thursday, faces up to a year in jail 
and a $1,000 fine on each of two counts on which he was convicted. Prosecutors 
asked Fulton County Judge John Bruner to impose the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
Bruner refused to allow Terry to introduce evidence on abortion during the 
trial, but the defendant and prosecutor Robert Lee O'Brien Jr. focused on the 
controversial medical procedure during closing arguments Friday to a jury of 
four women and two men. 
</P>
<P>
"Before God, I was trying to save innocent life -- even just one," Terry told 
the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old activist said he had been jailed several times as a result of 
protests and compared himself to such figures as black civil rights activists 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, women's suffrage campaigner Susan B. 
Anthony and the English Quaker dissenter William Penn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells of Jailings 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien countered that the people Terry named were jailed because they 
attempted to win rights denied to them while Terry was seeking to block women 
from exercising their right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, who remains free on bond, later said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Operation Rescue leader and more than 100 others were arrested July 19, 
1988, after they blocked the front doors of the SurgiCenter abortion clinic.

President Bush on Friday signed a 1990 spending bill that will launch the 
$5-billion super collider research project, an experimental atom smasher to be 
built in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The $225-million down payment on the super collider was included in a 
compromise measure Congress approved to provide $18.6 billion for next year's 
federal energy and water programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act is the first of 13 
appropriations bills for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Sunday, to reach 
Bush's desk. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1990 money for the superconducting super collider is for initial 
construction expenses of what ultimately will be a 53-mile circular underground 
tunnel about 25 miles south of Dallas. The rest is for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, expected to take up to seven years to complete, would hurl beams 
of protons into each other in a search for the basic building blocks of the 
universe.

SENATE VOTES TO BAR COUNTING OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN CENSUS 
</P>

<P>
In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the 
Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in 
the 1990 population count. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on a voice vote, despite arguments from the Bush Administration 
and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and unworkable. Just 
before the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against killing the 
proposal to bar aliens from the count. 
</P>
<P>
A Senate-House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against 
including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped 
from a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the State, Justice and Commerce 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the prohibition survives, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher has 
said that he would ask President Bush to veto any bill that comes to his desk 
with such a provision. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are the number of seats in Congress for California, Florida, New York, 
Illinois, Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis 
of next year's census. 
</P>
<P>
Federal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so 
millions of dollars in grants and other funds made available on a per capita 
basis would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The issue cuts across partisan lines in the Senate, with Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) arguing against the White House position on grounds that 
including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Seats Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens," Dole 
argued. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost 
House seats after the 1980 Census, and California and New York -- centers of 
illegal immigration -- each gained seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," Cochran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the 
decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx 
of immigration beyond the legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of 
population," Wilson said, adding that those states should receive additional 
federal aid to cope with the added problems. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical 
because the Census Bureau already has printed questionnaires that do not 
contain any question about legality of residence. 
</P>
<P>
For 190 years, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the federal 
government has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in 
accordance with the Constitution's provisions. "Fiddling with the numbers" now 
will destroy confidence in the census results, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action was sharply criticized by Undersecretary of Commerce 
Michael Darby, but he voiced hope that it would be reversed by a Senate-House 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be 
unconstitutional but literally impossible," Darby said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he is "optimistic, cautiously optimistic," that House 
conferees would resist the Senate-approved ban and not force Bush to veto the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was 
shocked by the Senate's decision. "It is going to have a dramatic and 
disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," Moreno said. "People are going to 
be discouraged from participating." 
</P>
<P>
A Census Bureau spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence," said 
bureau spokesman James Gorman. "If Congress passes a law that says we will or 
will not count people, we will do what it says."

capital gains, the battle moved to the Senate on Friday as Democrats vowed to 
tie up the tax cut in the Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats hope that the Finance Committee will send to the Senate floor a bill 
that replaces the capital gains tax cut with an extension of the tax break for 
individual retirement accounts. That would make it easier, they believe, for 
the full Senate to reject the capital gains tax cut, which could reach the 
floor as an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a reasonably good chance we'll be able to prevail here," 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the Democratic strategy is a Senate rule that might require the 
capital gains measure -- because it would increase future budget deficits -- to 
win 60 votes on the Senate floor rather than a simple majority of 51. 
</P>
<P>
A potential swing vote on the Finance Committee is Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), 
who said Friday that he is seeking a compromise on capital gains that might 
provide a tax break only for profits from financing new ventures. Pryor 
expressed doubts about the House-approved capital gains measure. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 to 15 Democrats in the Senate, including Alan Cranston of California, 
the deputy majority leader, also are working together in an effort to develop a 
compromise capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, appearing before the Senate tax panel 
Friday, lost no time in attacking the Democrats' alternative to the 
Administration-backed capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
Brady criticized the proposal by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd 
Bentsen (D-Tex.) to provide a 50% deduction for contributions to individual 
retirement accounts by taxpayers who are ineligible for IRA deductions under 
current law because they earn too much money. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Bentsen's proposal, which would also allow penalty-free early 
withdrawals from IRAs to buy a first home or to pay for college expenses, would 
provide too many benefits to upper-income Americans without necessarily 
increasing national savings. Democrats have leveled that same charge at the 
Administration's capital gains tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said also that Bentsen's IRA plan would drain government revenues. "The 
Administration cannot support the 50% proposal because of its cost," Brady 
said. "In the current environment requiring budget stringency, we do not have 
the funds to pay for such an expenditure." 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen plans to present his own tax proposal Monday to the Finance Committee, 
including the IRA expansion but without any capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
To make up for the lost revenues, Bentsen is expected primarily to recommend 
adding or extending some small taxes or eliminating a number of small tax 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Bentsen's expected proposals echo measures already included in the 
House-backed bill. Among them are a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals, limits on 
refunds to companies involved in leveraged buyouts and extension of airline and 
telephone taxes that are now scheduled for repeal. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes, aides said, an increase in the international air passenger 
departure tax, a new $3-a-passenger tax on commercial cruise ships, a speedup 
in the collection of payroll and gasoline taxes and a host of other relatively 
narrow measures. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Committee Democrats, returning Brady's fire, took the Administration to 
task for supporting the House-backed capital gains tax cut. The temporary tax 
cut, they said, would not boost investment and would mask its long-term revenue 
loss behind a brief spurt in tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill backed by the House on Thursday, the top rate on long-term 
capital gains held more than a year would drop to 19.6% from the current 
maximum of 33% for assets sold between Sept. 14, 1989, to Dec. 31, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1992, the tax rate on profits from the sale of stocks, real estate 
and most other assets would rise to 28%, but only profits that exceed future 
inflation would be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's sheer budget gimmickry," Bentsen said, warning Brady that the 
capital gains measure could have a "destabilizing effect on the market."

ATWATER CALLS TAX CUT VOTE AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR BUSH PRESIDENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater on Friday described House passage of 
the capital gains tax cut as "the most important political day of the Bush 
presidency." 
</P>
<P>
The reason, he said, sitting poolside at a posh Beverly Hills hotel, is that 
the vote highlighted a split in the opposition just at a time when Democratic 
leaders said it is time to stand up to the President, to stand up for 
something. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater spoke to reporters during one of his periodic working visits to 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians heard a different view Friday from Democrat Bill Clinton, 
governor of Arkansas and a possible 1992 challenger to Bush. Speaking over 
breakfast with reporters, Clinton said that the House vote on capital gains was 
more a matter of self-preservation by congressmen trying to retain their seats. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four House Democrats, two-thirds of them Southerners, abandoned Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and supported the President's tax cut on investment 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater said that was double the Democratic support he had expected. "I think 
from a purely political point of view it was the most important political day 
of the Bush presidency so far," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater said the Democrats plus the nearly solid bloc of Republicans -- only 
one defected from the President -- is "very reminiscent of those coalitions" 
that former President Ronald Reagan enjoyed in the early years of his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not naive enough to think that this is a permanent coalition . . . . (But) 
the Democratic leadership was hard-core on this. For the President to go and 
get 64 votes I think is very encouraging . . . . When you get this many 
Democrats on a vote that was this strongly denounced by the party leadership, 
that is a good sign for the future. I think it is a potential coalition for the 
future," the GOP chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Democrats were suffering from a lack of true national leader who 
could pull the party together. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Party in the Congress has become largely an entrepreneurial 
enterprise . . . . We haven't won the White House since 1980 and Democratic 
members of Congress have become used to having to fend for themselves and to be 
responsible for getting themselves elected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In this light, it is understandable for Democrats to follow the wishes of 
constituents back home. In particular, Clinton said, the timber industry was 
influential in winning over Democrats in the South with their arguments that a 
tax reduction on trees was important for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can take the fact that a lot of them defected from the party 
leadership as evidence the party is dead." 
</P>
<P>
The House vote Thursday of 239 to 190 could hardly have come at a worse time 
for Democratic leaders or a better time for Bush. Just this month, influential 
national leaders of the Democratic Party, including National Chairman Ron Brown 
and New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, had begun sounding the call to end the 
party's honeymoon with the Republican President and stand up for the things 
Democrats believe in. 
</P>
<P>
sh Cuomo Accuses Democrats 
</P>
<P>
In a fiery speech in Los Angeles earlier this month, Cuomo accused Washington 
Democrats of dormancy, timidity and "cordial contentment." 
</P>
<P>
"For myself as a Democrat, respectfully, I think we have given an appropriate 
period of deference to the newly victorious President," Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
In private meetings over the last couple of weeks, Brown has spoken out just as 
forcefully, telling Democrats it was time to start focusing on Bush's 
"failures."

The Italian airline Alitalia received permission for a route for the papal

flight to Seoul, the first stop on the 10-day trip, according to Vatican 
spokesman Joaquin Navarro. 
</P>

The airline announced last month that China's Communist government denied 
permission for the plane to fly over China. The government did not give an 
explanation. China severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1957.

ZSA ZSA'S A NO-NO AMONG THE BURGHERS OF BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Longtime Beverly Hills resident Harold Wittner was rushing to a Rosh Hashanah 
service on Friday when somebody told him that Zsa Zsa Gabor had been convicted 
on three of four charges in her three-week trial at Beverly Hills Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Wittner burst into loud, cackling laughter. "Throw her in jail for 20 years!" 
he exclaimed. Then he shook his head philosophically. "I'll pray for her." 
</P>
<P>
Near the scene of the crime, the diamond-studded celebrity offender wasn't 
getting much sympathy in her hour of defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"She thinks because she's show business, she can do anything," scoffed Sarah 
Schwimmer, another resident. "She's no better than you or I. I don't think she 
acted fair." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bored, Not Amused 
</P>
<P>
While Gabor, who lives in Bel-Air ("People who live in Beverly Hills do not 
behave like Miss Gabor," sniffed one civic leader), was entertaining the rest 
of America with courtroom histrionics, Beverly Hills was either bored or not 
amused. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very nice person," said a saleswoman in Gorgissima, on Dayton Way, 
where Gabor sometimes shops. Others acknowledged Gabor's charity work and her 
showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, in the chichi shops along Rodeo Drive a few blocks from the 
Courthouse, the salesmen and saleswomen professed Olympian disinterest in the 
trial. "Who is Zsa Zsa Gabor?" shrugged Leah Cabrera, who works in a store 
called Alaia. "She's a woman with a lot of diamonds who knows how to find very 
rich men." 
</P>
<P>
"If I see her on television, I switch the channel," said a clerk in a 
haberdashery, asking that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dismay at Perception 
</P>
<P>
For the staid and low-profile, who are the backbone of the little city of 
multimillion-dollar mansions, there was dismay that the trial was promoting a 
growing perception of their city as an enclave of fast-living celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"In Beverly Hills, nobody is impressed by, quote, 'celebrities,' " said Ellen 
Byrens, a prominent civic leader. "There's a big community beyond Rodeo Drive." 
</P>
<P>
And they don't believe in things like ticket-fixing, she added. "I believe that 
whatever happens to someone else should happen to Miss Gabor," Byrens said. 
"I'm not interested in what her Austrian husband says about the rich people who 
pay all the taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Many expressed repugnance at what they saw as a plea for preferential treatment 
by Gabor's husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, who is actually German. "I 
think the rich and famous should be judged differently," he said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
One Beverly Hills matron, who attended the trial regularly, shook her head in 
disgust. "Even the 95-year-old lady in the grocery store -- she knows the 
mayor, she knows the councilman," said the woman, who asked that her name be 
withheld. "Who isn't a prima donna?" 
</P>
<P>
But none expect preferential treatment from the police, she said. "If I drove 
away from an officer, no matter how rude, I wouldn't even get a chance to slap 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the elegant facades, Beverly Hills is a varied place, Mayor Max Salter 
said. Besides the rich and famous, there are doctors, merchants, engineers and 
other professionals -- "the largest part of the population," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But misperceptions of Beverly Hills are understandable, Salter said, because 
few see the real Beverly Hills. "The paparazzi don't chase retailers around," 
he said.

POPE AND ANGLICAN ARCHBISHOP MEET

Archbishop of Canterbury Robert A. K. Runcie met Pope John Paul II on Friday 
during the first day of a visit marked by controversy over the issue of 
Anglican-Catholic reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope embraced the archbishop at the beginning and end of the meeting, and 
Runcie said he was happy to visit the "engine room" of Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
"No theological disagreement will permanently divide us when we know each other 
no longer as strangers but as friends," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Runcie's trip, his first official visit to the Vatican, caused a stir in 
England after he said in a magazine interview that he would accept some kind of 
papal authority "linked to a renewed ecumenical and universal primacy." 
</P>
<P>
In response, some conservative Anglican leaders demanded his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Runcie, spiritual head of the world's 70 million Anglicans, will meet with the 
Pope for two more discussions during his four-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday he will become only the second Archbishop of Canterbury to attend a 
papal Mass since England split from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 over King 
Henry VIII's refusal to accept papal authority.

GAY RIGHTS GROUPS PROTEST APPEARANCE OF U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS CHAIRMAN AT SEMINAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several gay rights organizations are protesting the scheduled appearance of the 
chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission at a seminar led by a minister who 
has declared "a war on homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
The uproar has forced organizers of "Homosexuality and Public Policy 
Implications" to move its Oct. 6-7 conference to a secret location in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
William Allen, who was appointed to the commission by then-President Ronald 
Reagan in 1987, said that he will speak on civil rights at the symposium 
sponsored by the Anaheim-based California Coalition for Traditional Values. "I 
don't know what all the fuss is about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jerry Sloan, president of the Lambda Community Fund, a Sacramento-area 
group, accused the Coalition for Traditional Values of spreading "hate against 
homosexuals. For him (Allen) to lend the credibility of the U.S. government to 
these people's agenda is simply unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a professor of government at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, said his 
"fundamental view is that civil rights guaranteed to every American are not one 
whit less guaranteed to homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells Symposium Goals 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, who heads the sponsoring organization and who has 
declared a "war on homosexuality," said the symposium's goal is to educate 
people involved in public policy about the "nature and function of 
homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers are to include Reps. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach). Topics include "Reparative Therapy for the Homosexual" and "Criteria 
for Successful Treatment Towards Heterosexuality." "The topics are saying there 
is something sick and wrong with our lives. We do not believe it is true," said 
Carol Anderson, co-chair of the Los Angeles-based Gay and Lesbian Alliance 
Against Defamation. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we'd have some flak because we are proposing reparative therapy," 
said Sheldon. "But we had no idea this would have such an explosive reaction 
from the homosexuals. It is interesting it presents such a threat." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Orange County Visibility League, a gay rights organization, 
claims its 400-letter campaign chased the symposium from its scheduled location 
at the Doubletree Hotel in Orange. A spokesman for the hotel confirmed the 
symposium was canceled but declined to offer an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Move Location 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Sheldon said he will move the symposium to a secret location. 
Participants will be notified by telephone at the last moment where to go, he 
said. "People can be assured it's going to be held." 
</P>
<P>
Activists said they have written letters to President Bush and lawmakers 
protesting Allen's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think many members of Congress would be astonished that (Allen) would appear 
at a forum such as this," said Kevin Berrill, director of the Anti-Violence 
Project at the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington. "The 
commission has so little credibility in the civil rights community right now 
and Allen's scheduled appearance only increases the perception that it is 
anything but a commission to protect civil rights."

PUTTING IT IN PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cocaine seizure Friday was the largest in world history, according to DEA 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the largest in U.S. history took place in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on 
Nov. 17, 1987, when agents seized 4.35 tons of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The largest previous seizure in world history, the DEA says, took place on 
March 10, 1984, in Tranquilandia, Colombia, when 11 tons were seized. 
</P>
<P>
HOW DOES IT TRANSLATE? 
</P>
<P>
Seizures: The haul was roughly four times as large as the total amount of 
cocaine seized citywide in Los Angeles in 1988, according to the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
In the entire year of 1988, the LAPD seized 10,610 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the corresponding numbers for previous years: 
</P>
<P>
1987 -- 13,345 pounds 
</P>
<P>
1986 -- 13,184 pounds 
</P>
<P>
1985 -- 2,065 pounds 
</P>
<P>
1984 -- 758 pounds 
</P>
<P>
Height: LAPD narcotics officers say that an average kilogram brick of cocaine 
is roughly a foot long, six inches wide and five inches thick. The 20 tons 
amount to more than 18,000 kilograms. Using those figures, if the cocaine 
seized were stacked in kilogram packages, the pile would rise more than 7,500 
feet in the air, almost a mile and a half high, about half the height of Mt. 
Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S. It would also be 9 times the 
height of the First Interstate Bank Tower and 16 times as tall as City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Weight: The haul is equal to about four circus elephants, about 15 Toyota 
Celicas, or two fully loaded Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Money: Using a street value of $6.7 billion, the seized cocaine exceeds the 
annual sales of any industrial corporation in the United States except the top 
65 firms. For example, Texas Instruments' annual sales in 1988 were $6.2 
billion; Northrop's annual sales in 1988 were $5.8 billion, and Campbell Soup's 
annual sales in 1988 were $4.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The man considered the richest American, Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Moore 
Walton, has an estimated worth of $6.7 billion, according to the latest Forbes 
Four Hundred list. 
</P>
<P>
In another comparison, Sony Corp. bought Columbia Pictures this week for $3.4 
billion, and Anheuser-Busch bought the Sea Worlds parks for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1986, General Electric bought RCA (which included NBC) for $6.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Using that same $6.7-billion figure, the amount is larger than the gross 
national product of all but 67 nations worldwide. PAUL FELDMAN

CURRICULUM COMMISSION ENDORSES TEXTBOOKS THAT TEACH EVOLUTION

<P>
With little debate, the California Curriculum Commission endorsed proposed 
guidelines for science textbooks Friday that include controversial provisions 
requiring that evolution be treated as a "central principle" of science. 
</P>
<P>
It took the commission only a few minutes to unanimously approve the 187-page 
document that for months had been the focus of a bitter battle between 
fundamental religious groups that wanted the guidelines to leave room for the 
inclusion of "creation science" in textbooks, and scientific and 
anti-censorship groups that wanted evolution treated as accepted fact. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides said their attention will now turn to the State Board of Education, 
which will decide whether to reject, accept or revise the proposals. The 
guidelines will be used by publishers to develop new science textbooks to be 
used in California schools for the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the commission's decision, seven major organizations, 
including the National Science Teachers Assn., National Education Assn., 
American Federation of Teachers and the American Assn. of University 
Professors, urged the Board of Education in a joint letter to accept the 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"While showing deference to students' religious beliefs, the framework makes 
clear that science content should not be diluted by sectarian belief," the 
groups wrote.

BENEATH SYLMAR'S SURFACE: DRUG MENACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON and MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 12800 block of Bradley Street in Sylmar is a nondescript industrial park -- 
a Coca-Cola bottling plant on one side of the street, a firm that makes 
pacemakers on the other side and several small warehouse businesses mixed in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
It remained that way until Friday morning, when teams of law enforcement 
officials swarmed into the building at 12898 Bradley St. 
</P>
<P>
The largest drug cache in history, an estimated 20 tons of cocaine, and $10 
million in cash were surrounded by dozens of investigators from at least five 
police departments and three federal agencies. Television vans, their antenna 
dishes cranked upward, descended on Bradley Street, disgorging cameramen and 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seemed Out of Place 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the sudden appearance of burly SWAT team members armed with 
automatic weapons seemed out of place in a community nestled against the 
Angeles National Forest. Horses still trot down Sylmar sidewalks, and empty 
lots abound. 
</P>
<P>
But Sylmar is changing rapidly. For five years running, Sylmar has been Los 
Angeles' fastest-growing community, according to Los Angeles city planners. Its 
abundance of open space is viewed by planners as the last frontier for 
developers of residential and industrial properties. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar's reputation as a quiet enclave may be more historic than real. A 
condominium used as a drug laboratory exploded in May. Three Sylmar brothers 
pleaded guilty to killing a man over drugs in February. Last year, an anonymous 
tip led to seizure of 886 pounds of cocaine from a Sylmar home. And a 
plainclothes Los Angeles policeman was killed there in May, 1988, by 
South-Central gang members involved in a drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Business 
</P>
<P>
It was two years ago that a new business moved into Adriana's Pottery 
Warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people who work in the offices and other warehouses on Bradley 
Street were not fazed by the comings and goings of the employees of the new 
company. They assumed it was a legitimate business. Nothing seemed amiss. 
</P>
<P>
But for a few others, Friday's raid confirmed long-held suspicions. The 
company, they noticed, had few customers and fewer salesmen. Its operations 
were secretive and disruptive to other firms in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem like a good business," said David Barron, the owner of a 
construction company that worked out of an adjacent warehouse. "They said they 
were dealing in paintings, velvet paintings. I didn't see a market for that in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Well-Dressed' 
</P>
<P>
But he added that "they seemed to be making an awful lot of money. They were 
too well-dressed to operate a warehouse business." 
</P>
<P>
Other employees at the warehouse complex described frequent truck deliveries -- 
as often as once a week in the last six months -- to Adriana's. The deliveries 
often disrupted the other businesses. Long trailer trucks had to back up 
through the complex to unload at Adriana's, a tedious process observers said 
took as long as 45 minutes each time. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the maneuver, employees from Adriana's went to the other 
warehouses and asked neighbors to move their cars. 
</P>
<P>
At first, one construction employee said, they were polite about asking that 
cars be moved. 
</P>
<P>
But their requests turned into demands. "I got to get my truck out now," the 
employee remembered one man from Adriana's saying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deliveries Might Increase 
</P>
<P>
He said that he and other business operators in the complex discussed taking 
Adriana's to court or complaining to police about the inconveniences -- 
particularly after the Adriana's truck driver informed them recently that 
deliveries might increase to two times a week. 
</P>
<P>
The activities at Adriana's caught the eyes of others outside the complex as 
well. At Marketon, a garment bag manufacturer next to the complex, foreman Cleo 
Mosley said he often noticed trailer trucks being unloaded with a forklift. 
</P>
<P>
"Just boxes" were unloaded, he said. "I never knew what was in the boxes. 
Sometimes the truck came in every other week."

FEDERAL JUDGE UPHOLDS NEVADA'S LAW REQUIRING AUTO INSURANCE ROLLBACKS

<P>
A federal judge on Friday upheld Nevada's law requiring insurance companies to 
roll back auto policy premiums 15% below July, 1988, levels and freeze them 
there for one year. 
</P>
<P>
But after ruling from the bench, U.S. District Judge Bruce Thompson granted a 
10-day stay, allowing insurance company attorneys to move their challenge of 
the law to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Frank Rothman, speaking for the eight insurance companies that sued 
Nevada over the 1989 rollback law, said he sought the stay so the companies 
wouldn't have to cut auto insurance rates immediately. The new law was to have 
taken effect on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In granting summary judgment to Nevada, Thompson said the Legislature has the 
power to regulate the insurance industry and apparently had just cause for the 
cutback move because of skyrocketing rates. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the law is not unconstitutional because companies could apply for 
relief from the forced auto rate cuts one year after they take effect by 
applying for higher rates with the insurance commissioner.

OVERLOOKED BY RECRUITERS, 5-10 DOWIS IS WALKING TALL AT AIR FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royston, Ga., is hardly more than two quick pumps of the brake pedal along 
Highway 29 heading into South Carolina. If you choose to pause at either of the 
town's stoplights, you will notice the mural of Ty Cobb on the water tower, the 
statue of Ty Cobb at city hall and the Ty Cobb Memorial Hospital near his 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, folks in Royston might have to erect another water tower. Another native 
son, Air Force Academy quarterback Dee Dowis, is gaining acclaim, to the mild 
surprise and immense pleasure of locals who remember him as a scrawny kid 
running the streets from the time he was, well, knee high to Ty Cobb's statue. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis, 21, has grown -- numerically and emotionally, if not quite physically -- 
into a scrawny major college quarterback whose elusive running has helped Air 
Force post a 4-0 record this season. It also has put Dowis in the running for 
the Heisman Trophy along with Notre Dame's Tony Rice, West Virgina's Major 
Harris and all the other bigger names and bodies. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Dowis seems to be a contender. The 5-foot-10 (wearing heels), 153-pound 
(after a pasta dinner) senior leads the nation in rushing with averages of 145 
yards and 16.5 points a game going into the Falcons' contest today against 
Colorado State at Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force, somewhat unaccustomed to such national attention for its football 
program, has nonetheless launched a comparatively restrained Heisman campaign 
on Dowis' behalf. On the grass-roots level, some of Royston's 2,404 residents 
already have talked to Helen Brown, Dowis' mother, about making Dee as famous 
as Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I go, I swear, I can hardly do my work without people stopping me 
and saying how proud they are of him," Brown said. "Our whole town follows him. 
They say to me, we're going to have to change that sign (on Highway 29) to 
'Home of Ty Cobb and Dee Dowis'. Wouldn't that be something?" 
</P>
<P>
What makes Dowis different from the norm, and what might sway some 
underdog-conscious Heisman voters is his slight build, the unsullied image of a 
military man and the wistful fact that his football career will soon end. 
</P>
<P>
All cadets have a five-year military commitment after graduation and, unlike 
the special consideration given to the Navy's Napoleon McCallum and David 
Robinson, the Air Force has not made allowances for star athletes in the past 
and says it will not in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Chad Hennings (an Air Force All-American defensive tackle in 1987) came out of 
here a few years ago and he probably would've gone number two or three in the 
draft, and he couldn't go pro," Dowis said. "I guess that answers that 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Dowis said he would not mind giving professional football a try -- as a wide 
receiver, not as a quarterback. But he accepts the inherent circumstances, says 
he only plays football for fun anyway. Next year, Dowis probably will pursue a 
master's degree in business and perhaps serve as a graduate assistant coach for 
Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis has an ability to elude tacklers -- juke and slither are football 
writers' favorite descriptions -- and has led the team to the second best total 
offense average in the country. It is the whole package that attracts 
inordinate attention. People are suckers for men in uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
It has reached the point that this chronic overachiever is dealing with 
overexposure. The national media has found its way to the Academy and done so 
in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Introverted and occasionally embarrassed around strangers, Dowis does not find 
talking about football nearly as fun as playing it. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived unavoidably late for an interview Wednesday in a storage room 
adjoining the sports information office at Air Force. He looked tired and 
confirmed that he was "worn out." A publicist sat Dowis down and told him that 
his 3 o'clock interview would be rescheduled, to which Dowis replied, "Cool." 
It already was after 3 and this was Dowis' 2 o'clock appointment. Practice 
would be at 4, and Dowis also needed treatment on his left knee, which was 
injured last week against Texas El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
He is unfailingly polite and speaks with a soft Southern drawl. However, he's 
easily distracted by the same unimaginative questions about his Heisman 
prospects, his height and the structured military life. 
</P>
<P>
He sat through a 20-minute interview without making eye-contact and bided time 
by tightening a stray string of athletic tape around his left index finger. He 
watched the tip turn from red to blue with steady pressure, then released the 
string. He repeated the process throughout. At one point, Dowis rubbed his 
temples so hard in trying to hold back fatigue that red marks appeared. 
</P>
<P>
It is consistent with Dowis' accommodating nature, however, that he has yet to 
turn down an interview request. His reticence is more from bewilderment than 
cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets to me at times," Dowis said. "Like right now. I'm just worn out. The 
last few weeks, there's been a lot (of interviews). But it brings attention to 
the school, and that's good. I understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Dowis also seems to have been born without an ego. By most accounts, he is a 
modest and serious kid who never asked for all this attention. 
</P>
<P>
His standard response to Heisman speculation: "I think it's an honor just to be 
mentioned. I don't even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Mariotti, a columnist for the Rocky Mountain News, has written that Dowis' 
only Heisman drawback may be that he does not care if he wins the award. A 
recent conversation between columnist and quarterback: 
</P>
<P>
"You mean you don't have any thoughts at all about the Heisman?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's right." 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't your family talk about the attention you're starting to receive?" 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked to them about it." 
</P>
<P>
"What about CNN? Was that (interview) a thrill?" 
</P>
<P>
"They're nice people." 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't they ask you about the Heisman?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
"Dee, I gather you don't want to talk about the Heisman." 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly." 
</P>
<P>
There is more about Dowis to explore than hyped awards and the complexities of 
the wishbone offense. Dowis has an abiding love for football and family, common 
among Georgians. 
</P>
<P>
Dee was 3 when his father, Leonard, died of a heart attack. Leonard Dowis had 
been a local football hero who would have played halfback for the University of 
Georgia, 30 miles south in Athens, had World War II not intervened. Leonard, in 
later years, had coached high school football in Royston but quit shortly 
before his only son was born. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis' mother, who married local businessman Harold Brown when Dee was 7, said 
her son's physical attributes, determination and mannerisms resemble Leonard's. 
</P>
<P>
"He was little, like Dee," Helen Brown says of her first husband. "I never saw 
(Leonard) play ball in high school, but I'm told he ran just like Dee. That 
cutting and juking, you know. There, he definitely takes after his father. They 
both hate to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"The day before (Leonard) died, he wanted Dee to go to Y-camp if he wanted to 
learn football because he didn't want to coach him. It was as if he was giving 
me a message about how to raise Dee, like he knew he was going to die. A 
premonition or something." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Dowis never played for his beloved Georgia Bulldogs. Neither did Dee, 
but for a different reason. They did not want him. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Vince Dooley, former Bulldog coach, would not let a prospect leave 
the state without an exit visa. But in the big pond that is Georgia high school 
football, Dowis apparently was too small a fish. Despite impressive prep 
rushing statistics, other schools also ignored Dowis. Recruiters from nearby 
Clemson, Duke and Furman visited Royston and left after seeing Dowis in the 
flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Davis, Dowis' coach at Franklin County High School, described many 
recruiting visits in a recent interview with the Rocky Mountain News: "I'd go 
get (Dowis) out of class, and then I'd watch (recruiters') eyes when they saw 
him walk in. You could just see it in their eyes. They'd be thinking, 'This is 
the guy?' " 
</P>
<P>
Dowis said he was not particularly military-minded when he applied to Air 
Force, but he wanted a quality education as well as the chance to play football 
in college. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps an indication of the culture shock to come was the reaction from 
townspeople when they first heard Dowis had received a scholarship to the Air 
Force Academy. 
</P>
<P>
"They all asked," said Dowis' mother, "what base Dee'd be stationed at. I found 
it funny. They really didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Dowis didn't know all that was involved at the Academy, 
located at the base of the Rampart Range north of Colorado Springs. They gave 
him a heavier course load than he would have received at most civilian 
universities, which he had trouble handling. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis' longing for Royston almost led him to transfer after his freshman year. 
His mother remembers emotional evening phone calls home that first year. She 
said Dee occasionally knelt at the Cadet Chapel and prayed for guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything about the military," Dowis said. "They just gave me the 
chance to play football and get a great education at the same time. This is 
definitely one of the top academic places in the country. People on the outside 
see this as pretty prestigious. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough (the first year). I didn't quite know what I was getting into, so 
I was kind of shocked when I got here. I didn't have my mind made up to stay 
here the whole time when I first got here." 
</P>
<P>
He had all but signed transfer papers to Georgia Tech after his freshman year, 
but his mother, his high school coach and Cal McCombs, an Air Force assistant 
coach, talked him out of leaving the Academy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really close," Dowis said. "I'd gone to Tech and talked to them, and I 
just came back (home) to get my stuff. But I just couldn't quit (the Academy) 
when it came right down to it. Also, I went to coach McCombs' house and talked 
to him for three hours that night. I decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, yeah, I like it here. I think a lot of it has to do with being a senior." 
</P>
<P>
Dowis' quiet demeanor turns aggressive when on the field. His running style is 
similar to that of former Oklahoma quarterback Jamelle Holloway. In fact, 
former Sooner Coach Barry Switzer said Dowis could have started for him at 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry has said Dowis is a more talented option 
quarterback than Notre Dame's Rice. Irish Coach Lou Holtz will not say that. 
But, after watching Dowis and reading his statistics, Holtz deemed Dowis a 
Heisman contender. 
</P>
<P>
If Dowis maintains his prolific statistical pace, he will be hard to discount 
when ballots are cast. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Dowis rushed for 1,315 yards, a National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. record for quarterbacks. Last season, in a more balanced attack, he 
gained 972 yards. The Falcons pass sparingly, but Dowis is capable of going to 
the air for the Force. Last season, he tied an NCAA record when he completed 11 
straight passes against Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis' prowess, however, is running. He has rushed for 2,869 yards in his 
career, only 430 short of the NCAA record for career rushing yardage by a 
quarterback, held since 1974 by Freddie Solomon of Tampa. Dowis only needs to 
average 53.8 yards per game in Air Force's final eight games to break Solomon's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
There is an outside chance that Dowis might break the record at home on Oct. 14 
against Notre Dame. Of potentially more significance in that game would be a 
matchup between Dowis and Rice on national television. Each team's potentially 
unbeaten record, and hundreds of Heisman votes, could be in the balance.

UNBEATEN COUGARS WON'T CATCH TROJANS NAPPING IN PULLMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pullman, Wash., a town named for railroad sleeping car inventor George Pullman, 
is itself a sleepy little town near the Idaho border. Its serene state is in 
contrast to the aggressive football that is sometimes played there. 
</P>
<P>
USC has had its problems in Pullman as recently as 1986, when the heavily 
favored Trojans were routed, 34-14. Only a few USC players remain from that 
team, but the memory of the game will be with them when the Trojans meet the 
Cougars today at Martin Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we were 4-0 and coming off big wins over Baylor and Washington," 
recalled All-American defensive tackle Tim Ryan, who was a freshman at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think they were a very good team (2-2-1 at the time) and we got 
stunned. We really got worked over by their option cutback play. It's one of 
the ugliest feelings I've had since I've been at USC." 
</P>
<P>
The game was significant inasmuch as it was the first loss of a 7-5 season that 
led to the firing of USC Coach Ted Tollner. In that sense it was a watershed 
game. 
</P>
<P>
As for Washington State, it didn't win another game the rest of the season, an 
embarrassing footnote for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Cougars aren't a sleeper team this season. They're 4-0 under new 
Coach Mike Price after being written off as a second division Pac-10 team. 
Washington State lost its coach, Dennis Erickson, who moved on to the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Price, a former Washington State player and assistant coach, who replaced 
Erickson after eight seasons at Weber State, inherited a team that had lost 14 
starting players and most of the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Price, who took his staff to a positive-thinking retreat and had a similar 
on-campus program for his players, is working every psychological angle. 
</P>
<P>
For example, instead of wringing his hands at the prospect of meeting the 
Trojans, who are 9 1/2-point favorites, Price is challenging them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to be bragging when I say this, but I think we have to adjust our 
mental framework," Price said. "I think USC has got to come in here and beat 
us. I don't think we have to worry about beating USC. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't think we can win, we're never going to win." 
</P>
<P>
If Washington State wins, Price wouldn't view it as an upset and wouldn't want 
his team labeled as giant-killers. He would prefer to regard it as evidence 
that the Cougars are a factor in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Washington State has beaten USC only once since 1957 and has won 
only five games while tying four and losing 40 in the series, Price is trying 
to convince his players that there isn't any mystique in playing the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Beating USC isn't any bigger deal than beating Oregon State, he says. Merely 
another conference game. That's a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
Price was asked on his weekly television show for his response to a comment by 
former UCLA coach Dick Vermeil, who said on ABC's telecast of the Ohio 
State-USC game that the Washington State game would be "a gimme" for the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be all right after he sobers up," Price quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Vermeil's remarks would make Larry Smith wince. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has an enviable Pac-10 record, losing only to Oregon on the road since he 
became USC's coach in 1987. To keep that record intact, he's trying to impress 
on his team that Washington State is not a "gimme" game. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a fine team, the best combination of offensive and defensive players 
we've met," Smith said. "And they're by far the quickest team we've met." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan and linemate Dan Owens, who were in on 70 plays when the Cougars upset the 
Trojans in 1986, don't need Smith to remind them of the possible pitfalls in 
Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally look forward to the challenge," Ryan said. "We're going up to do 
a job and we're going to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
The game will televised on Channel 7 at 12:30 p.m. . . . USC has a 2-1 record 
after losing to Illinois and beating Utah State and Ohio State. . . . Tailback 
Scott Lockwood did not make the trip. Lockwood recently had a cast removed from 
his injured thumb and will start practicing with the team Monday. Tailback 
Calvin Holmes has a sprained ankle but he made the trip. . . . USC quarterback 
Todd Marinovich hasn't missed any practices because of his sprained left 
(passing) wrist. . . . Tom Dabasinskas, a reserve center, had arthroscopic knee 
surgery and will be sidelined from three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
USC outside linebacker Junior Seau said he is dedicating his season to Colorado 
quarterback Sal Aunese, who died last Saturday of inoperable stomach cancer. 
They're second cousins and grew up together in Oceanside. . . . Seau has five 
of USC's 14 quarterback sacks this season, causing Coach Larry Smith to 
comment: "He's one heck of a football player and is the first outside 
(line)backer since Marcus Cotton who has been a knife in a guy's side. He puts 
pressure on the quarterback, whether it's a blitz or a three-man rush. We do a 
lot of things to use his ability. Just let Junior go." 
</P>
<P>
USC is top-ranked in the Pacific 10 in rushing (267.7 yards a game), total 
offense (448) and total defense (237.7). The Trojans are also fourth-ranked 
nationally in rushing defense, yielding an average of 49 yards. . . . USC 
tailback Ricky Ervins is the conference's second-leading rusher, averaging 
109.3 yards a game. . . . Washington State has the league's leading punter in 
Rob Meyers. He's averaging 46.4 yards a punt.

AS TRADE BAIT, FERRY RANKS HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS ARE LISTENING TO OFFERS FOR THEIR TOP DRAFT PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Round and round they go, trade rumors nonstop for a player who's 'round the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ferry isn't in the National Basketball Assn.? Wrong. Danny Ferry is very 
much a part of the league, even as his season began in Italy. Mr. Popular, in 
absentia. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have talked trade, if only on a peripheral level, ever since they 
made the 6-foot-10 All-American forward the No. 2 pick in the June 27 draft. 
And the talks continued until the day Ferry signed with Il Messaggero in Rome. 
And even now, with Ferry playing in Italy, the talks have kept going. 
</P>
<P>
Why? It's partly because of the gathering of most front-office personnel and 
coaches at the recent league meeting that has made the ferry-go-round the most 
popular ride in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Let's take a spin down the rumor mill: 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Charlotte, two No. 1 draft choices and a player, perhaps Dell Curry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Golden State, Ralph Sampson and a No. 1, at least before the Warriors 
traded Sampson to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Miami, Kevin Edwards and a No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From San Antonio, Willie Anderson and a No. 1, although Spur Chairman Red 
McCombs does not want to part with Anderson, despite the cool relations between 
last season's rookie-of-the-year runner-up and Coach Larry Brown. Or, Frank 
Brickowski and a No. 1 and a No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Philadelphia, Hersey Hawkins and a No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Cleveland, Ron Harper and a No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor said he has talked with "10 or 11 teams" 
since Ferry was drafted but would not discuss details, except to say that talks 
never reached the serious stage. That is not a surprise, considering that other 
teams would naturally look to take advantage of the Clippers' misfortune of 
losing their No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
"It came out . . . that we would listen to offers for Danny Ferry," Baylor 
said. "Many teams have called us about him, but some of the trade rumors have 
started before we had even talked to some teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't deny that we've talked to several clubs, but I won't comment on what 
we've discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Donald T. Sterling would prefer to keep Ferry, at least until the spring, 
when the matter can be reassessed after the Italian season. But he also 
understands the offers are coming. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a reasonable and an equitable offer, we might make a trade," he said. 
"Are we soliciting offers? No. But are we getting calls? Yes. There have been a 
number of offers. Most have been for multiple draft choices, and we probably, 
if we were to make a trade, would expect players first and draft choices 
second." 
</P>
<P>
Most trade talk seems to be about both, probably so the Clippers could get a 
player they want and the other team would not lose too many bodies until Ferry 
could return next season. Most of all, though, it's because of a growing 
feeling within the organization that the time has come to let an already young 
team grow without the worry of adding three rookies every year. Do they really 
need two more first-round draft choices coming in next season? 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, as Baylor and director of scouting Barry Hecker have said, insists 
that the Clippers had no indication Ferry would balk at coming to a team loaded 
with forwards and stories of ineptness. And Ferry himself has said it was not a 
Clipper-motivated move. 
</P>
<P>
So why are there so many disbelievers? 
</P>
<P>
Or are some people talking trade with the Clippers expecting a fire sale to try 
and recoup some of the losses from Ferry's departure? 
</P>
<P>
That thinking, Sterling said, would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Danny Ferry's decision to go to Europe was bad," he said. "But I 
also don't think it's his ultimate decision. As he explained it, the decision 
is for one year and he intends to consider coming back to America to play in 
the NBA. His rights are very valuable, and our organization is always looking 
to improve. If we could trade those rights for equal value or better, we would 
seriously consider making the trade. If not, we will retain them." 
</P>
<P>
But as Orlando Magic General Manager Pat Williams told the Orlando Sentinel: 
"Realistically, if Danny had been picked by any other team in the NBA, this 
wouldn't have happened. This was just his way of making his unhappiness with 
the Clippers clear to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Let the bidding continue. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers came to a contract agreement with guard Jeff Martin of Murray 
State Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers for Martin, the 31st player selected in the draft, are similar to 
those that Jay Edwards, the 33rd pick, agreed to the day before -- three years, 
two of which are guaranteed. Martin, as the higher choice, will get a slight 
boost from Edwards' estimated $200,000 rookie salary. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a 6-foot-6, 195-pound shooting guard, was the Ohio Valley Conference 
player of the year last season at Murray State in Kentucky after averaging 25.6 
points a game. He became the Clippers' No. 1 property from the draft when Ferry 
signed to play in Italy.

LAKERS SHOW INTEREST IN GREENWOOD, REACH AGREEMENT WITH A. C. GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Free-agent forward David Greenwood, who played at UCLA in the 1970s and most 
recently was not re-signed by the Denver Nuggets, passed a physical examination 
commissioned by the Lakers Friday and may sign with the club before training 
camp opens next week in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, confirmed that Greenwood, 32, passed 
the physical, but the team still is considering other options in its search to 
fill retired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Greenwood seems to be physically healthy and in shape," West said. "But at 
this point, we don't know what we are going to do. We're exploring all the 
possibilities. We'll continue to explore (Greenwood's availability). We want to 
do something by Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood, who is 6-feet-9, has played for four National Basketball Assn. teams 
and has a career scoring average of 11 points a game. He missed parts of last 
season with Denver because of an injured left Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
West also said the Lakers have reached a tentative agreement with power forward 
A.C. Green, a restricted free agent. West said a copy of the contract, which 
figures to pay Green more than $1 million for the coming season, has been sent 
to Marc Fleisher, Green's New York-based agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope to have (Green's contract) done by Monday," West said. SAM

Four sports agents face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines after 
pleading guilty to charges arising from secret payments to former Univeristy of 
Florida football and basketball players during their college careers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Gainesville (Fla.) Sun reported that the South Florida-based 
agents will never represent athletes again under a plea-bargaining agreement on 
reduced charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The plea entered by Gerald Gratenstein, Greg Latimer, John Kasbar and Glenn 
Haft also ensures that the high-profile trial Florida officials had feared will 
not take place. 
</P>
<P>
The star witness was expected to be former Florida basketball player Vernon 
Maxwell, who told a grand jury that he received secret cash payments from coach 
Norm Sloan and his assistants.

Appearance fees and other payments to track and field stars are being 
investigated by Britain's income-tax office. 
</P>
<P>
The British Amateur Athletics Board and the Amateur Athletic Assn. said they 
were giving full cooperation to the Inland Revenue Service's inquiry, which 
will focus on athletes' tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry follows allegations by former world record-holder Steve Ovett and 
the subsequent disclosure of the theft of nearly $40,000 in appearance money 
from the promotion officer of the athletics board, Andy Norman.

NEWSWIRE: WARRIORS SIGN MULLIN TO A NINE-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Mullin, the Golden State Warriors' first-round draft pick from St. John's 
in 1985, Friday signed a nine-year contract with the National Basketball Assn. 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin, 26, averaged 26.5 points, 5.9 rebounds and 5.1 assists a game last 
season, his fourth. Only Chicago's Michael Jordan and Portland's Clyde Drexler 
had higher averages in all three categories. Mullin, an all-star selection, was 
named to the All-NBA second team. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin became a restricted free agent after last season. There have been 
repeated rumors throughout his career that the Brooklyn native might eventually 
join the New York Knicks as a free agent, but the signing precludes that. 
Mullin's salary was $700,000 last season.

WARNER CAN STILL INSPIRE SEAHAWKS; 
</P>
<P>
TAILBACK'S SPEECH LEADS TO CLUB'S FIRST VICTORY OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Seattle Seahawks' locker room got strangely quiet as Curt Warner started to 
address a players-only meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
The softspoken tailback was angry because his teammates had played poorly in 
losing their first two games of the season. Warner said the team had been torn 
apart by contract disputes and dissension. 
</P>
<P>
After quoting from the Bible, Warner said his teammates needed to redefine 
their goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our radios on, but we're not tuned to the same station," Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks then went out and beat the New England Patriots, 24-3, last Sunday 
for their first victory. 
</P>
<P>
Did Warner's speech inspire Seattle? 
</P>
<P>
"I think his speech did a lot," safety Nesby Glasgow said. "A lot of times when 
you have team meetings it's the same old rhetoric: 'You've got to go out and 
play hard.' The one thing Curt did was to make us all focus on what needs to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow said he was stunned by Warner's outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"I was somewhat surprised, but once he got to talking, I think everybody felt 
it was coming from his heart. When you have a guy who's usually quiet like Curt 
stand up and talk the way he did, it was inspiring." 
</P>
<P>
What motivated Warner's outburst? 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really thinking about whether or not it was going to be 
inspirational," Warner said. "It was something I wanted to say because I was 
mainly talking to myself, as well as the other guys on the team, about what we 
need to think when we go out and play." 
</P>
<P>
Warner didn't just talk, he also played his best game of the season, rushing 
for a team-high 65 yards. And he did it with a swollen knee. 
</P>
<P>
After undergoing arthroscopic surgery to remove cartilage from his right knee 
Aug. 7, Warner has flourished. He's the ninth-leading rusher in the American 
Football Conference going into Sunday's game against the Raiders at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Warner rushed for 1,449 yards to lead the AFC in his rookie season, 1983. But 
in 1984, he tore ligaments in his right knee in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
He underwent reconstructive surgery and was in a cast for eight weeks. After a 
year of extensive rehabilitation, Warner returned and was named the NFL 
comeback player of the year, rushing for 1,094 yards in 1985. He set a team 
record by rushing for 1,481 yards in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But last season, it happened again -- he reinjured his right knee. Although 
this injury wasn't as severe as the first one, it was depressing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to deal with at first," Warner said. "But . . . I just thanked the 
good Lord that he didn't take it all away from me. I could have turned it a bit 
more and messed up some ligaments. Then you have to ask yourself if you're 
going to play again." 
</P>
<P>
Warner's slashing, pounding running style has taken a severe toll during his 
six-year NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was like a kamikaze when I first came into the league," Warner said. "I was 
crazy. It's not that I can't do the same things, but those hits take a toll 
after a while." 
</P>
<P>
The toll has included two knee surgeries and three ankle operations to remove 
bone spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Warner played with the ankle injury last season, and his rushing average fell 
to 3.9 yards a carry, his worst in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports that former team president Mike McCormack tried to trade 
Warner after last season. 
</P>
<P>
"The explosiveness that characterized Warner's style is all but gone," wrote 
columnist Art Thiel of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "One major knee surgery 
and an ambulance full of smaller hurts have reduced Warner's bursts to 
hesitations. The Seahawks are upset enough to consider a trade." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Flores, who succeeded McCormack last February, has no plans to trade 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still not the Curt that he was before," Flores said. "But he's certainly 
a force." 
</P>
<P>
Like Raider tailback Marcus Allen, who has been supplanted by Bo Jackson, 
Warner has been replaced by fullback John L. Williams, who was second to Eric 
Dickerson in total yardage in the AFC last season. 
</P>
<P>
Does it bother Warner that he isn't the focus of Seattle's rushing attack? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be honest and say that it bothered me at first because I had carried a 
lot of the load before," Warner said. "But I look at it this way: John L. can 
carry the load, too. I don't get upset about it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Seahawk rushing attack was non-existant in the first two games. 
Seattle, which never led in its first 10 quarters this season, had to pass to 
get back into the games. 
</P>
<P>
But Seattle's rushing attack excelled last week. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Warner's 65 yards, Williams rushed for 64 yards and caught five 
passes for 71 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Warner was the star of the Seahawks in his first four years with the team. 
</P>
<P>
He had his own TV show and more endorsements than any other Seahawk. But fame 
was fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like doing the TV show," Warner said. "I just don't want to be in 
front of a camera like that. When you're getting beat week in and week out and 
you have to go do a TV show, it's not a whole lot of fun -- and I didn't enjoy 
it. I was under fire."

RAMS NOT EAGER TO FACE MONTANA; 
</P>
<P>
THEY ARE AMONG THE 49ER QUARTERBACK'S BIGGEST FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lines formed early this week at Rams Park as coaches and players queued up to 
praise the league's most prominent wallflower, San Francisco 49ers quarterback 
Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Having just seen footage of Montana's latest exploits -- a remarkable 
fourth-quarter, four-touchdown performance against the Philadelphia Eagles last 
Sunday -- the Rams couldn't help but trip over their adjectives. They 
hyperbolized themselves silly. They did everything but request tickets to 
Montana's inevitable Hall of Fame induction ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson set the tone by declaring that Montana "just maybe" is the 
best quarterback ever to play the game. Had he been pressed, Robinson probably 
would have disposed of the qualifier, such is his admiration for Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was cornerback Jerry Gray, who said he still remembers watching a 
Montana-led Notre Dame team defeat his beloved University of Texas back in 
1978. Gray, born and reared in Lubbock, Tex., was in high school at the time, 
but he recalls thinking that Montana possessed something special. The years 
have not changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still the same old Montana," he said. "As far as making the plays (goes), 
he's the best." 
</P>
<P>
And the most exasperating, too. Defensive tackle Doug Reed, who has done his 
share of chasing the elusive Montana, said he would contribute to any 
retirement gift for the 49er quarterback. In fact, the sooner, the better. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'll send him the limo," Reed said. "When you want to do it? You want to 
do it this week? That would be a great time, to do it this week." 
</P>
<P>
Sure it would. The Rams travel to Candlestick Park Sunday to face the 
undefeated 49ers and, ta-da, Montana, who historically has a knack of picking 
on Robinson's team. What a wonderful gesture it would be, said Reed, laughing, 
if Montana announced his retirement shortly before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
No such luck. Montana will be there, as usual, his history of picking apart Ram 
secondaries securely intact. Already this season, he has thrown seven touchdown 
passes and completed about 66% of his attempts. His quarterback rating, that 
confusing collection of statistics mixed together like a margarita, places him 
second in the entire National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
But never mind all the numbers. When people speak of Montana, they speak of his 
presence, his aura. You don't need a calculator to figure his worth there. Just 
glance at the three Super Bowl rings Montana owns. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any sense comparing him with anybody playing (now)," 
Robinson said. "He's done far more than anybody else has. He's made comebacks, 
won championships, done phenomenal things, run for touchdowns, thrown for 
touchdowns, led comebacks, had a back operation. He's unparalleled in my 
experience in this game." 
</P>
<P>
And while there are other quarterbacks in the league with stronger arms (John 
Elway), stronger bodies (Jim Kelly), faster legs (Randall Cunningham), there is 
no one, said Gray, who approaches Montana's knack at mini-miracles. "Whenever 
it's like, 'Joe, we need this,' he'll get them in that position to do it. You 
can count on him to get them there." 
</P>
<P>
Against the Eagles last Sunday, Montana completed 11 of 12 fourth-period passes 
for 227 yards and those four touchdowns (a team record). In all, he completed 
25 of 34 attempts for 428 yards and five scores. It was a memorable effort, one 
that few people will forget, except maybe Montana, who isn't much for reliving 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about his celebrated back injury of 1986 fall on uninterested ears. 
Requests to compare recently retired coach Bill Walsh and new Coach George 
Seifert are basically ignored. As for reaction to the many Ram compliments, 
Montana simply says thank you and moves on. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't pay much attention to it at this point," Montana said. "Someday, when 
it's all over, then I'll sit back and reflect on it, but not now." 
</P>
<P>
When he does, Montana will likely remember 1989 as the season that begin 
without a quarterback controversy. Seifert, unlike Walsh in 1988, made it clear 
in training camp that Montana was the starter and that Steve Young was the 
backup. Odd as it may seem for someone who just led their team to a Super Bowl 
victory, Montana appreciated the gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm somewhat more relaxed," he said. "But I still have that same 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on, hopefully, that's something that doesn't weigh on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, said Seifert, who described his decision to name Montana the 
starter as "an easy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably enough, Seifert hasn't tinkered too much with the 49er offense. If 
anything, he said, Montana's success can be partly traced to Walsh's offensive 
attack, which has evolved, along with Montana, during the last 10 years. So, 
Seifert said, why break with tradition? 
</P>
<P>
There are other things that haven't changed since Seifert became Montana's new 
boss, most noticeably the inherent need to win. Montana thrives on it. In fact, 
he takes exception to the prevailing wisdom that few teams repeat as Super Bowl 
champions because of a mental letdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree with that whole outlook," he said. "I think once you've been to the 
Super Bowl . . . there's no feeling like that. Anything short of that, to me, 
would be a letdown and not the other way around. (It's not that) 'we don't need 
to win because we won last year.' People say we can't win, but, hey, we want to 
go back. We've been there and know that feeling. I think it would make us 
hungrier more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Montana certainly has the appetite for a return visit. Asked how he would 
assess his season so far, his voice took on a slightly disgusted tone. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played all right, but there are a lot of things I think I could have done 
better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Is that so? The Eagles, 38-28 losers to Montana and the 49ers, would probably 
disagree. And so would the Rams, who saw the whole thing on film. To them, 
there is no one better than Montana -- no matter what Montana says.

IT'S FINALLY OFFICIAL: KELM DEFINITELY OUT OF RAM LINEUP UNTIL NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "day-to-day" foot injury that sidelined Larry Kelm on Aug. 21 will now keep 
him out of the lineup until at least November. The Rams announced Friday that 
they were placing the linebacker on six-week injured reserve to make room on 
the roster for LeRoy Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
Kelm separated the metatarsals in his left foot on a routine lunge into the 
line during an exhibition against the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
The first reports were encouraging, but Kelm is just now able to walk normally. 
</P>
<P>
"He's too far gone now," Coach John Robinson said Friday. "They're talking two 
weeks of straight-ahead running, two weeks of cutting and then two weeks of 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm was expected to inherit Carl Ekern's starting inside linebacker position 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously affecting the Kelm decision was the rapid improvement of linebacker 
Mark Jerue, who is expected to start practicing next week after another long 
rehabilitation from an off-season knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Jerue is eligible to return in time for the New Orleans Saints game Oct. 22 at 
Anaheim Stadium, and probably will. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of miraculous," defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said of Jerue's 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Kelm isn't eligible to play again until Nov. 12, a home date against the New 
York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, who has returned after serving a 30-day suspension for substance abuse, 
will start at right cornerback against the San Francisco 49ers Sunday at 
Candlestick Park. CHRIS DUFRESNE

NEIGHBORHOOD'S CRIME-BUSTING DRIVE PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A campaign to stamp out drugs and violence in a single neighborhood of 
South-Central Los Angeles officially ended Friday, with its organizers 
celebrating a 45% drop in crime and pledging to continue their grass-roots 
movement in troubled communities throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders and supporters of the Taking Our Community Back campaign gathered at 
Green Meadows Recreation Center to cite the accomplishments of their 45-day 
movement against gangs -- not the least of which, organizers said, was being 
able to walk freely in that very park. 
</P>
<P>
"This park has now been freed up," said Brotherhood Crusade President Danny 
Bakewell, referring to the gang wars that used to plague Green Meadows and keep 
neighborhood residents away. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to the Avalon Gardens (housing project) you'll see people are now 
sitting on their front porches," continued Bakewell, chairman of the community 
campaign. "Children are now coming out to play, (and) that community is whole." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers contend that during the course of the six-week effort, crime dropped 
45% in the 10-square-block target area bounded by 93rd Street, Avalon 
Boulevard, Central Avenue and Manchester Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief William Rathburn said it was too soon, and the 
number of crimes too small, to fully assess the effort. However, he said, 
"there's no doubt it has been very successful," with the number of emergency 
calls dropping significantly and cooperation between residents and police 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patrol Teams 
</P>
<P>
Bakewell added that constant surveillance by patrol teams and phone calls to 
the Department of Building and Safety have resulted in one neighborhood rock 
house being scheduled for demolition and three others encountering a dramatic 
drop in business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not so naive to believe that these people have changed their values and 
will no longer deal dope," said Bakewell, who has also confronted businesses in 
the community that sell gang and drug paraphernalia. "But we have forced them 
to have respect for the community. They are no longer openly violating the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the movement will now take on a life of its own in the target 
community, with a committee of neighborhood residents encouraging existing 
block clubs and helping to create new ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Director Hired 
</P>
<P>
Bakewell added that an executive director has been hired to specifically 
oversee the Taking Our Community Back effort. He said that in two weeks, 
organizers will announce a new neighborhood where the movement will be 
launched. 
</P>
<P>
A manual will also be made available for other communities that wish to start 
similar efforts.

TREASURER, AIDES FAULTED FOR ABSENCES DURING AUDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR and JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg and some of his top investment officers were 
absent so often in the weeks surrounding a series of critical audits that they 
"reduced the effectiveness of operations" in a city department that manages 
$2.1 billion in city funds, according to the city administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
The absences continue as the treasurer's office struggles to comply with a 
sweeping subpoena request for thousands of documents requested by a federal 
grand jury investigating Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
As senior treasurer's office staff members feverishly arranged Friday for the 
first batch of documents to be delivered to federal investigators, Rittenberg 
left for Key West, Fla., to attend the weeklong convention of the National 
Assn. of Government Deferred Compensation Administrators, the mayor's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He was absent on eight of 28 working days between Aug. 10 and Sept. 19, 
according to City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie's report Thursday to the 
City Council. Rittenberg could not be reached Friday for comment. He earlier 
said that he had the flu. 
</P>
<P>
One of his investment officers, George Sehlmeyer, was absent 16 days during the 
same period and has yet to return to work. His attorney said Sehlmeyer has had 
the flu and dental surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question the treasurer's office is a mess," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky who requested the report. "There is a problem in the treasurer's 
office and it has not been resolved since all of this unravelled on them in the 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent of three city audits, by the city controller's office on Sept. 
18, found "major weaknesses " in the treasurer's office, including violation of 
competitive bid policies and sloppy record keeping. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg and Sehlmeyer were key figures in city investigations of Bradley's 
relationship with Far East National Bank, which had paid the mayor $18,000 as 
an adviser in 1988. The mayor later returned the money. 
</P>
<P>
In March, after the mayor talked to Rittenberg, the city reinstated a 
$1-million deposit with the bank and added another $1 million. Sehlmeyer later 
told a City Council hearing that he had noted on the Far East bid sheet that 
the deposit was being made "per the mayor." Someone in the treasurer's office 
obliterated the reference with correction fluid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deputy Put in Charge 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Treasurer Gerald Capodieci, who has been put in charge in 
Rittenberg's absence, hunched over a personal computer terminal on Friday and 
said he was too busy to discuss the operations of the treasurer's office. "I 
don't usually type," said Capodieci. "That tells you something." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, it was disclosed that the treasurer's office has been hit with a 
subpoena from the U.S. attorney that requests "all notes, drafts, calendars, 
diaries, logs, account statements and other written material, photos, graphs, 
computer disks, tapes and other recordings," relating to eight banks and 
brokerage firms that figure prominently in an expanding investigation of 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of work, a major project," said Rona Berns, administrative 
assistant to the treasurer, who was arranging stacks of computer printouts. 
"We've got to get some of this out today," if the office is to comply with the 
Oct. 10 subpoena deadline, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cash Management Officer Henry Davis, who heads the team that invests the $2.1 
billion of city funds, was clearly exasperated as he leafed through paper work 
on his desk. "I just can't talk now," Davis said in apology. "We've got to get 
these things out." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the office's problems, cash flow analyst William T. Hoss resigned in 
August. His replacement, according to Comrie's report, "is on a steep learning 
curve" and has been absent five days. 
</P>
<P>
Since March, when the city first launched an investigation of Bradley's 
finances and conduct in office, the treasurer's office and its senior officers 
have been under a nearly daily barrage of requests from local, state and 
federal investigatory agencies for documents, interviews and appearances at 
public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to comply with the U.S. attorney's subpoena, the broadest of the 
requests, "will severely impact daily operations," according to Comrie. His 
report quoted Deputy Treasurer Capodieci as saying that 60% of the work of 
collecting the required documents must be done by the small, three-man 
investment staff. 
</P>
<P>
City investments appear to be safe, Comrie said, as only a small number of 
financial transactions are required each month. A large proportion of the $2.1 
billion the office oversees is placed in medium- to long-term securities, which 
do not require constant reinvestment decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said Friday that the office has managed to keep a good return on 
investment but said he is concerned that poor management and morale could 
affect "our bottom line."

JURY SUBPOENAS BRADLEY RECORDS AT BROKERAGE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL SAPPELL and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury has subpoenaed Mayor Tom Bradley's personal financial 
records from a West Coast brokerage firm where a Bradley fund raiser and former 
Harbor Commission appointee served as the mayor's stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. confirmed Friday that 
documents were demanded this week by the U.S. attorney's office, which has 
intensified its months-long investigation of Bradley's personal business 
dealings and conduct in office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trading Records 
</P>
<P>
The records involved securities traded for Bradley by Ira Distenfield, who 
abruptly resigned his Harbor Commission post last May amid inquiries by The 
Times into his links to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a subpoena a couple of days ago," said Bateman Eichler spokesman 
Gene Meeker. "They are asking for information about Bradley's account. That's 
all I can tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Meeker declined to specify the nature of the documents that federal authorities 
have demanded or provide any details of Bradley's financial transactions. But 
he did confirm for the first time that Distenfield was the mayor's broker and 
"probably" brought Bradley's business to Bateman. 
</P>
<P>
Distenfield was one of several brokers at various firms used by Bradley for his 
financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1988, Distenfield served as manager of Bateman Eichler's 
Century City office, one of the brokerage house's most lucrative branches. 
Several former executives of the firm have told The Times that he was hired, in 
part, because of his political ties to Bradley and the prospect that his 
mayoral influence could bring the firm city business. 
</P>
<P>
The Bateman spokesman said he did not know why Distenfield was hired or whether 
political connections played a part. 
</P>
<P>
The subpoena of financial records from Bateman Eichler is part of a broad U.S. 
Justice Department inquiry of Bradley that has been expanded in recent weeks 
after officials in Washington determined that the case warranted serious 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old saying, 'Where there's smoke, there's fire,' and there is heavy 
smoke here," a federal officials close to the Bradley probe told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, through his press secretary, declined to comment on his relationship 
with Distenfield. But the mayor, in a statement released Friday, reiterated his 
confidence that "there has been no impropriety on my part." 
</P>
<P>
He confirmed receiving a grand jury document subpoena on Sept. 11 but 
discounted its significance, saying it is a "routine procedure" used by the 
U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The issuance of a grand jury subpoena does not mean that charges will, 
thereafter, be brought against anyone," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
He also protested "extraordinarily improper" comments from unnamed federal 
sources regarding the seriousness of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ties to Banks 
</P>
<P>
Besides Distenfield's connection to the mayor, FBI agents and the U.S. 
attorney's office are investigating an array of the mayor's business ties to 
banks and investment firms to determine whether he engaged in conflicts of 
interest or bought securities with the benefit of insider information. 
</P>
<P>
Among the eight financial institutions whose relations with Bradley are under 
scrutiny by federal authorities are Far East National Bank, which paid Bradley 
$18,000 in consultant fees at a time when it was seeking and receiving city 
business, and Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn, whose founder and vice chairman 
is Abraham Spiegel, a personal friend of Bradley who has sought favors from the 
mayor's office on development projects. 
</P>
<P>
The deepening federal probe comes at a time when the mayor is struggling to put 
behind him a scandal that has tarnished an image of high integrity that he 
cultivated over 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 13, the mayor made a dramatic, 40-minute presentation on live 
television to declare that City Atty. James K. Hahn had exonerated him of any 
conflicts of interest and that the controversy was finished, even though his 
office said Friday that the mayor had received his grand jury subpoena three 
days before his televised statement. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn concluded that Bradley had shown an "indifference" to ethical concerns and 
"clearly stepped into the gray area" between innocence and a chargeable crime. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney also said that his report should not be interpreted as a 
vindication of the mayor, a statement that was included because Hahn knew of 
the accelerating federal probe and grand jury subpoenas, his spokesman said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's subpoenas revealed for the first time that 
Distenfield's relationship with the mayor was of interest to federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
Distenfield is one of Bradley's biggest contributors. Campaign records show 
that since 1985, Distenfield has given more than $86,000 to Bradley's various 
election efforts and has financed major fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Distenfield resigned his powerful post as Harbor Commission president in May on 
the same day that The Times sought his comment on sworn statements that 
Distenfield made in 1987 before a confidential New York Stock Exchange 
arbitration hearing. In his testimony, Distenfield said he used his influence 
with Bradley to obtain a hotly contested contract for the brokerage firm of 
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., which employed him as an executive. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate subpoena this month to the city treasurer, which was revealed 
Thursday, the grand jury demanded documents that involved three firms that 
employed Distenfield: Bateman, Smith Barney and ITD Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has denied that he was influenced by Distenfield. 
</P>
<P>
Smith Barney officials could not be reached for comment on whether the grand 
jury had subpoenaed records from their firm. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Distenfield could not be reached for comment. But in an earlier 
interview with The Times, the ex-commissioner said he has provided the mayor 
with financial advice, encouraging him to join the boards of directors of 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I have whispered in the mayor's ear over the past couple years that I would 
certainly encourage him attempting to make some time available to lend what I 
think is his image and his love for business," Distenfield said in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the grand jury's demand for records came amid a highly unusual, 
four-day absence from the public eye by Bradley. Since a tour of South-Central 
Los Angeles on Monday, Bradley has made no public appearances and none were 
scheduled until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The last such lull in his appearance schedule was in August when Bradley was 
preparing for two days of interviews with police and city attorney's 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley press secretary William Chandler said Friday that Bradley's low-profile 
was "absolutely and unequivocally" not related to the expanding federal 
investigation. He declined to say what the mayor has been working on, other 
than he needed "office time so he could get through city-related paper work." 
Chandler said he knew of no meetings this week between the mayor and his team 
of defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
In another development in the Bradley controversy, lawyers for Juanita St. John 
filed a new motion in Superior Court seeking to head off a trial of the 
embattled head of a controversial, city-financed Africa trade task force. St. 
John, a Bradley business associate who is under investigation for possible 
misuse of public funds, is charged with failing to produce subpoenaed records 
showing how she spent $180,000 in unaccounted for task force funds. A pretrial 
hearing is scheduled Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
St. John, who is under criminal investigation by the district attorney's office 
major fraud unit and the Los Angeles Police Department, has lost two attempts 
to get the subpoena charge thrown out on the grounds that the demand for 
documents made by the city controller was unconstitutional. The motion filed 
Friday seeks to overturn a Municipal Court ruling last month against St. John.

ARKANSAS GOVERNOR SCHOOLED ON SOUTH L.A. LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
For Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, crouched astride a tiny blue plastic chair amid 
the sixth-graders at 92nd Street School in South Los Angeles on Friday, it was 
a political education unlike that offered in the back-slapping salons of the 
Westside, the area that normally defines this city for the nation's political 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my friends, he got shot about two weeks ago," said an 11-year-old boy, 
fidgeting nervously across a wood-grained table from Clinton. "He got shot in 
the leg. They had to take some of the meat out of one leg and put it in the 
other, and they had to put one of those long things, those . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Rods?" Clinton asked, a stunned look crossing his face. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shot Three Times' 
</P>
<P>
"Rods, yeah, they had to put it in his leg," answered the boy. "He got shot 
three times. He didn't do nothing. All he was doing was standing in the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
As if playing a macabre game of can-you-top-this, an emboldened 11-year-old 
girl offered the story of her cousin, killed as she watched. 
</P>
<P>
"He was minding his own business. All of a sudden -- bam-bam-bam," she said, 
mimicking the shots, "he was gone." 
</P>
<P>
With their harrowing tales, dispensed matter-of-factly with the stammers and 
blushes of childhood, the children of 92nd Street School entered the national 
debate over improving the nation's schools and the corollary urban problems of 
gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit was meant as an information-gathering jaunt for the governor. 
He was co-chairman of the two-day education summit called in Charlottesville, 
Va., this week by President Bush and the nation's governors and is the 
designated drafter of national education goals to be drawn by next February. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the trip did have a partially political motivation. For years, 
prominent Democrats have loudly decried the fact that national candidates slide 
into town just long enough to line their campaign treasuries with Los Angeles 
money before rushing back home. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit, arranged last week, came after he heeded the complaints of 
friend and Democratic fund raiser, Stanley Sheinbaum. 
</P>
<P>
"I have for a long time been complaining that so many of these Democratic 
candidates come into town and are so focused on fund-raising that they never 
get past the Regency Club or Chasen's or those elegant places where the major 
donors are found," Sheinbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stranger 
</P>
<P>
Clinton, 43, is no stranger to Los Angeles and its monied political circles, 
traveling here from his home in Little Rock yearly for speeches. He is 
frequently mentioned as a future presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians have wandered through the city's needy neighborhoods, usually 
in an election year and usually trailing cameras to film their expressions of 
compassion. But Friday's tour was a political rarity -- intentionally 
under-publicized, it drew no television cameras. It showcased a world away from 
the plush environs of the stereotyped Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with community activists in the basement of a church on 43rd 
Street, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, boarded a van for a tour of South Los 
Angeles. A guide, pointing to and fro, provided the voice-over for a travelogue 
of despair. 
</P>
<P>
"MSB -- Mad Swan Bloods," said Tony Massengale, an organizer for the Southern 
California Organizing Committee, a community group. He pointed with his right 
arm toward gang graffiti on Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hold Sway' 
</P>
<P>
"They (MSB) hold sway up to the stoplight," Massengale said. 
</P>
<P>
"Avalon Gardens Housing Project," he said, gesturing to the left. "That's where 
the Avalon Gardens Crips started." 
</P>
<P>
The van turned a corner and glided past Will Rogers Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks green," he said. "But it's one of the dead parks. Winos have it by day, 
gangs at night. They burned down the gym two years ago. Families by and large 
don't use it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
At the 92nd Street School, the children espoused harsh punishments for gang 
members and drug users, their voices rising in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing they got to do is take the gang-bangers out," said one little 
boy, asked by Clinton what he would do if he could run Los Angeles. Officials 
requested that the childrens' names not be used for fear that gang members 
would retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good People' 
</P>
<P>
"Put 'em all in jail for life," the boy continued. "Just put 'em somewhere. 
Give them their own city, so all the good people could live . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Do you resent the gangs? Clinton asked. 
</P>
<P>
The boy nodded soberly: "They affect my life. A lot." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's fair," added one little girl, "that even the babies have to 
die."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DYING MAN'S FAMILY IN FIGHT WITH AF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of an Air Force employee dying of cancer is angry with the 
Department of Defense for refusing to fly the man by air ambulance from 
Palmdale to Boston so he can spend his last days in the suburb where he grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Avram Brody, 25, a civilian who worked as an electronics engineer at Edwards 
Air Force Base for three years, was diagnosed as having an inoperable brain 
tumor last year, officials said. Doctors in July gave him only weeks to live. 
</P>
<P>
Family members say his final wish is to return to his childhood home of 
Norwood, Mass. But the cost of providing commercial air ambulance service is 
between $5,000 and $10,000, a sum the family cannot afford, said Margaret 
Sullivan, an assistant to U.S. Rep. Nicholas Mavroulas (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
Despite requests over the last few days from Mavroulas, U.S. Rep. Joseph 
Moakley (D-Mass.) and U.S. Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), Air Force officials 
have refused to fly Brody, citing regulations that prohibit the transport of 
civilians. Air Force Maj. Fran Tunstall said such trips would cost the 
government about $30,000.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 HURT, 1 HELD AS TRUCK SLAMS PICKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four people, including an 18-month-old boy, were injured when a trash truck 
collided with a pickup truck on a steep roadway outside the Puente Hills 
landfill in Bassett Friday morning . 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said they were holding for questioning 
the trash truck's driver, George Grigorian, 29, of Los Angeles, who authorities 
said was speeding and driving with a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup, Jose Trinidad Gonzalez, 30, of San Gabriel, was on 
his way to unload debris, county fire officials said. Part of the pickup was 
sheared off after the 14-ton truck smashed it, nearly folding it under the big 
truck's high front bumper. 
</P>
<P>
It took rescue workers about 20 minutes to free Gonzalez, who was listed in 
critical condition at County-USC Medical Center. His three passengers, 
including two adults and the 18-month-old, were taken to Greater El Monte 
Hospital. The two adults were hospitalized, one in serious condition, and the 
other in guarded condition. The child suffered cuts and was released after 
treatment. Grigorian was not injured.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRAUDE OPPOSES WATT CITY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing the possibility of traffic gridlock, City Councilman Marvin Braude 
expressed opposition Friday to construction of the Watt City Center west of the 
Harbor Freeway in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said at a City Hall press conference that there are "too many problems" 
with the Watt project, which includes 62-story and 27-story towers and an 
eight-story parking structure between 7th and 8th streets. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman noted that in addition to the proposed 1.69-million-square-foot 
Watt project, there are currently 63 other major projects -- with 35 million 
square feet of office space -- in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
"The resulting traffic congestion will spell gridlock for the Harbor Freeway 
and downtown streets and will create a catastrophe beyond our comprehension," 
Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
He called on the Planning Commission to bar construction of the Watt project 
and to reconsider plans for Central City West, which calls for development of 
314 acres west of the Harbor and south of the Hollywood freeways near downtown.

<TEXT>
<P>
The president of Azusa Pacific University has announced he will resign to take 
a job as president of another university. 
</P>
<P>
Paul E. Sago, 58, who has headed Azusa Pacific since 1976, declined to name his 
new school but said it is in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This week the school's Board of Trustees accepted his resignation, which is 
effective Jan. 31, 1990, and lauded him as "a strong and effective leader." 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Ted Engstrom said the school will soon launch a search to find a 
replacement for Sago. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1899 by the Quakers, Azusa Pacific is a liberal arts school of about 
2,700 students now affiliated with evangelical Christian organizations.

FULLER SEMINARY NAMES PROVOST IN FIRST OF 4 KEY APPOINTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a key administrative appointment at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, 
the nation's largest nondenominational school of ministry, a 49-year-old 
Christian philosophy and ethics professor has been named provost. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Mouw, who joined the Fuller faculty four years ago, assumed the 
second highest post on the campus this week amid praise as a noted scholar, 
innovative thinker and bridge-builder with other faiths even though he remains, 
in his own words, a "conservative evangelical." 
</P>
<P>
Selection of the new provost has drawn interest in the evangelical world 
because the appointment is the first of four to take place over the next six 
years, a period of crucial transition for the 42-year-old school. Fuller boasts 
an on-campus student body of 1,600 seminarians and a total enrollment of nearly 
2,900. Only a Southern Baptist seminary in Ft. Worth enrolls more students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hubbard to Step Down 
</P>
<P>
David Allan Hubbard, seminary president since 1963, must step down from his 
post in 1995 when he turns 65. Because of other anticipated retirements, new 
deans also will be chosen for the schools of theology and world mission. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard has led Fuller from fundamentalist leanings to more moderate views, 
sometimes incurring charges that some professors using historical-critical 
methods were disloyal to the Bible. And he has brought in representatives of 
the miracle-oriented Pentecostal movement, sometimes at the risk of losing 
hard-sought intellectual respect. 
</P>
<P>
Although the seminary has had a strong Presbyterian influence in the past, it 
is beholden to no denomination. It nevertheless faces steady scrutiny from 
theologically conservative Protestant supporters over whether it faithfully 
represents Bible teachings. 
</P>
<P>
"The vision is constantly being renegotiated," Mouw said. As a result, he said, 
"the selection of leaders here always sends signals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hubbard Praises Mouw 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, without a provost since the death of Lawrence DenBesten in June, 1988, 
issued a statement praising Mouw as having "the ability and desire to keep us 
on course." 
</P>
<P>
Mouw is likely to reflect the Hubbard approach, according to George M. Marsden 
of Duke University Divinity School, whose 1987 book, "Reforming 
Fundamentalism," describes Fuller's evolution. 
</P>
<P>
"His appointment puts a crucial link in place," Marsden said by telephone. 
"Mouw combines a basic theological tradition with openness and an innovative 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Mouw said he will continue to encourage Fuller to address social problems, 
including peace and justice issues, and to endorse "full equality for women in 
leadership roles in the Christian community." 
</P>
<P>
And, Mouw already has been breaking ground in a third area, promoting an 
ongoing dialogue with Catholic and non-Christian groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helps Lead Dialogue 
</P>
<P>
For two years, he has co-chaired an evangelical-Roman Catholic dialogue with 
Msgr. Royale Vadakin of the Los Angeles archdiocese. The committee is close to 
publishing its first study paper on common interests as well as on tensions 
between Catholics and evangelicals, such as Protestant evangelizing in 
traditionally Catholic Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
Mouw also is an adviser on religious freedom to the American Jewish Committee 
and has been an observer at meetings of the multifaith Interreligious Council 
of Southern California. In congratulating Fuller Seminary on Mouw's 
appointment, Rabbi Alfred Wolf of Los Angeles praised him as "an outstanding 
scholar . . . (who) knows how to build bridges between (people)." 
</P>
<P>
His interfaith involvements do not foreshadow a change in Fuller's evangelistic 
goals, Mouw said. Fuller is comfortable with its ties to an institute in 
Pasadena that trains missionaries to the Islamic world and with its link to the 
nationwide "Jews for Jesus" organization, which seeks Jewish converts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My own view," Mouw said, "is that it is important for evangelicals to share 
their faith with everyone and rather aggressively. But it is wrong to reduce 
Jews and others to 'targets' for evangelism. We have a lot to learn from the 
Jewish community and we see them as partners in various efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Mouw earned his doctorate in philosophy at the University of Chicago and taught 
for 17 years at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., a school affiliated with 
the Christian Reformed Church.

<P>
$26.9-MILLION CHURCH OFFICES DRAW PROTEST

<P>
A dedication ceremony for the U.S. Catholic bishops' $26.9-million headquarters 
building this week was joined by demonstrators, who charged that the costly and 
impressive new structure reflects insensitivity to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
As church and government dignitaries gathered for the dedication, more than two 
dozen Catholic activists sang hymns such as "The Lord Hears the Cry of the 
Poor" and displayed a banner admonishing the bishops to "Make Room at Your Inn, 
for Christ's Sake." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing for Homeless Urged 
</P>
<P>
"This building is a scandal to the poor," said Michael Kirwin of the Catholic 
Worker house in Washington. Most of the protesters who showed up Tuesday were 
from the Catholic Worker movement, which runs "houses of hospitality" for the 
homeless around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who met earlier in the day with the church leaders inside 
the elegant five-story structure near the campus of Catholic University, said 
the money used to erect the building should have gone to help the poor and 
homeless. They called on the bishops to allow a few homeless families to live 
in the new headquarters during off-hours as a symbol to encourage churches, 
convents and seminaries to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Father Kenneth Doyle, a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic 
Bishops, said the church agency would "explore the possibilities" proposed by 
the Catholic Workers in the meeting with several officials, including Auxiliary 
Bishop Joseph Sullivan of Brooklyn, who heads the bishops' committee on poverty 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirwin said the Catholic Workers were "not at all satisfied" with the 
meeting and that they were told that sheltering the homeless would be an 
inappropriate use of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the formal dedication, which was not disrupted by the demonstration, 
drew more than 200 people, seated in rows of chairs around the building's front 
door entrance that was flanked by the flags of the United States and the 
Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bishops' Work Praised 
</P>
<P>
On hand at the dedication were several members of Congress and about 60 
bishops. Reps. Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.), Lindy Boggs (D-La.) and James L. 
Oberstar (D-Minn.) all praised the bishops for their work on behalf of the 
powerless and vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Susan DeConcini, the wife of Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), declared that the 
Catholic Church and the U.S. government "have the same philosophy -- that every 
American counts." 
</P>
<P>
In June, the bishops moved their headquarters to the northeast Washington 
neighborhood after 47 years in a downtown building that had fallen into 
disrepair.

NEW IMMIGRANTS REVERSE DECLINE IN BOSTON CHURCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BOSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newly arrived immigrants have reversed half a century of decline in the number 
of churches in this city, according to the first comprehensive directory of 
Boston churches. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boston Church Directory: 1989-1990," published this summer by the Emmanuel 
Gospel Center, shows that a quarter of the 415 churches in Boston were formed 
within the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
These new churches are more likely than their predecessors to speak a language 
other than English, to share quarters with another congregation and to include 
nonwhite members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not in the Phone Book' 
</P>
<P>
"Half of these churches are not in the phone book," said Rudy Mitchell, the 
directory's editor. "Some may have as many as 500 members, and others have only 
12." 
</P>
<P>
The vitality of new congregations was one of many surprises in the directory, a 
non-commercial publication compiled by researchers at the Emmanuel Gospel 
Center, an interdenominational agency that promotes church growth in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Boston's churches speak 25 languages in addition to English and 
represent 69 denominations. While 64% of city residents say they grew up 
Catholic, 78% of the city's churches are Protestant. Forty percent are 
predominantly American black. Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking churches are 
among the fastest growing. 
</P>
<P>
Social change since the mid-1930s had sapped the strength of both Catholic and 
mainline Protestant churches here, which lost 91,617 members between 1936 and 
1986, according to figures compiled by the gospel center from denominational 
records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Number 
</P>
<P>
Boston has fewer churches than other cities its size. Mitchell attributes the 
lower number of churches in part to the Catholic parish system, which in the 
United States has developed much larger congregations than its Protestant 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
But a steep drop in mainline and Unitarian-Universalist congregations that 
began in the mid-1930s and accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s is also a large 
factor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my judgment, the growth of smaller churches shows vitality, but the growth 
is not anywhere near the scope of the loss experienced by the larger mainline 
and Catholic churches," Mitchell said.

Protestant leaders from both East and West Germany joined with American Jewish 
leaders here this week in affirming the bonds between their two faiths and 
expressing concern "that anti-Jewish ideas remain respectable in some circles 
of German society and even theology." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued at the conclusion of two days of meetings between 
representatives of the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany led by 
Bishop Martin Kruse of Berlin-Brandenburg and leaders of the American Jewish 
Committee, American Jewish Congress, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and 
Synagogue Council of America. 
</P>
<P>
The group noted that in November, 1988, the German Protestant churches issued a 
joint statement in which they said, "Even if some of those who were involved 
have atoned for their actions, and even if others have meanwhile died and a new 
generation has come to the fore, all of us remain responsible for the 
guilt-laden past. As we face up to this bitter realization, we become aware 
that theology and the church have contributed to the long history of 
estrangement and hostility toward Jews." 
</P>
<P>
In the interfaith statement issued Monday, the German Protestant and American 
Jewish leaders said, "This unfortunate history must come to an end. Christian 
thought, speech and action must never again contribute to fostering hostility 
toward Jews. In this connection, we note with concern that anti-Jewish ideas 
remain respectable in some circles of German society and even theology. We 
consider it essential to resist such tendencies because we are convinced that 
they constitute a distortion of the Christian message and bear the most bitter 
fruits."

Citadel Won't Seek Valley Federal: Citadel Holding, the Glendale-based parent 
of Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan, decided not to seek the purchase of 
struggling Valley Federal Savings, a Van Nuys-based thrift with $3.3 billion in 
assets. Citadel, with nearly $5 billion in assets, toyed with the idea of the 
merger for more than two years. Valley Federal, which has sold several branches 
recently to boost its financial health, said it would continue its 
restructuring.

HIGH COURT TO CONSIDER REVIEW OF STORE MERGER

<TEXT>
<P>
Will Friday the 13th prove to be American Stores' Lucky day? 
</P>
<P>
On that day in October, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to consider whether 
to review the antitrust case that has so far prevented the Salt Lake City-based 
company from merging its Alpha Beta and Lucky supermarket units. A review would 
further delay, and possibly scuttle, American Stores' effort to unite the 
chains under the Lucky banner. 
</P>
<P>
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp challenged the integration 13 months 
ago on the grounds that it would diminish competition and result in higher 
grocery prices. Since then, the case has meandered through the California court 
system. In late August, the Attorney General's Office posted a $10,000 bond so 
that it could pursue the case with the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the Supreme Court's decision probably will be issued Oct. 16, sources 
close to the case said. MARTHA GROVES

Control Data Corp. Chairman Robert M. Price, facing criticism about the 
struggling computer company's management, said Friday that he will relinquish 
his duties as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Price said a search committee has been set up to find the person who will take 
over those duties. Price, 57, will remain chairman, a post he has held since 
January, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The search committee, which is expected to find a successor to Price within two 
to three months, will be headed by Albert Etchelecu, an outside director. 
Etchelecu said there are strong candidates within the Minneapolis company, most 
notably Lawrence Perlman, president and chief operating officer.

IMPERIAL EXPECTS LOSS IN QUARTER; JUNK BONDS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Imperial Corp. of America, the parent of Imperial Savings of California, said 
it expects its third-quarter results to reflect an $80-million after-tax loss 
taken on the value of its $1.1-billion junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
However, ICA declined to estimate what its net loss for the quarter ending 
today will be. 
</P>
<P>
The expected loss is a result of provisions in the savings and loan bailout 
bill passed by Congress in August that require all S&amp;Ls to sell their junk 
bonds by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
ICA spokesman Tim Larrick said the company's interpretation of the legislation 
is that the S&amp;L must mark down to market value its entire high-yield, 
high-risk junk bond portfolio, which is now worth $130 million less than ICA 
paid for it. The after-tax impact of the loss provision will be an $80-million 
loss, Larrick said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, before ICA decided that it had to mark down its entire portfolio, it 
disclosed in a regulatory filing that the market value of the bonds had 
decreased and that they were then worth $88.6 million less than the S&amp;L had 
paid for them. Since then, the junk bond market has deteriorated further and 
ICA's portfolio has slipped in value to $130 million below its cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
ICA is in the midst of a restructuring announced in July shortly after the 
resignation of President Kenneth Thygerson. In his four years at ICA's helm, 
Thygerson led ICA into a variety of non-traditional S&amp;L activities, 
including junk bond investments, car loans and mobile home loans. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring, done at regulators' urging, was prompted by mounting losses 
and dwindling capital. ICA's losses for the first six months of this year were 
$33.1 million, contrasted with a $16-million profit for the first half of 1988. 
The losses have been caused by loss provisions so far this year of $82.2 
million, including $28.4 million for junk bond losses.

DOW CUTS RALLY SHORT, CLOSES WITH 2.09 LOSS 
</P>

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market was mixed Friday, pulling back from an early gain in a session 
typical of the hesitant pattern that has prevailed all through September. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up about 12 points at midday, ended the 
day with a 2.09 loss at 2,692.82. For the week, the average posted a net gain 
of 11.21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 885 up, 565 down and 521 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 155.30 million shares, down from 164.24 million in the 
previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, 
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
over-the-counter market, totaled 184.73 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market appeared to benefit in early trading from last-minute 
buying by investing institutions readying their portfolios for reports to 
clients on the third quarter, which ended with Friday's session. 
</P>
<P>
But they said uncertainty over recent weakness in the dollar and some upward 
pressure on interest rates limited enthusiasm for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported Friday morning that the index of leading economic 
indicators rose 0.3% in August. The figure came in close to advance estimates 
on the Street, and had little perceptible effect on the market. 
</P>
<P>
After dropping 44.45 points in September, the Dow Jones industrials reached the 
end of the third quarter showing a net gain of 534.25 points, or 24.64%, since 
New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose 1 to 
44 7/8; International Business Machines gained 1/4 to 109 1/4; General Electric 
dropped 1/2 to 56 1/2, and McDonald's was down 5/8 at 29 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich tumbled 4 1/8 to 12 1/8 as the most active NYSE issue 
on volume of more than 3.6 million shares. Analysts cited disappointment over 
the $1.1-billion price for which Anheuser Busch agreed to buy six HBJ amusement 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser Busch, which separately announced the death of its former chairman, 
August A. Busch Jr., rose 1 1/8 to 43 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Airline issues were broadly higher amid signs of a revival of takeover 
enthusiasm. UAL gained 4 1/2 to 282; AMR 2 3/4 to 86 1/2, and Delta Air Lines 2 
3/8 to 73 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks fell back on profit taking after a relatively active trading 
week. The Nikkei 225-share index fell 53.22 points to 35,636.76. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed modestly higher on the London Stock Exchange. The Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 7.7 points, or 0.3%, to 2,299.4, the 
day's high. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rebounded late Friday after sustaining modest losses earlier in the 
day as investors continued to keep a close watch on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 7/32 point, or about $2.20 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which falls when the price rises, slipped to 
8.23% from 8.25% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills edged up to 8.15% as the discount added 1 
basis point to 7.89%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.29% as the discount 
advanced 3 basis points to 7.86%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.45% as the 
discount gained 2 basis points to 7.85%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge on overnight loans to 
one another, fell to 8.50% after peaking at 9.75% during the day. The rate was 
9.25% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar resumed its decline under pressure of a fifth straight day of dollar 
sales by central bankers. 
</P>
<P>
After rising slightly on Thursday, the dollar fell to its lowest level since 
late July. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar eased to 139.35 Japanese yen from 140.85 yen on Thursday. 
Late Friday in London, the dollar traded at 139.57 yen. In New York, the dollar 
traded at 139.05 yen, down from 140.50 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the pound rose to $1.6150 from Thursday's late $1.6085. In New York, 
the pound rose to $1.6195 from $1.6107. 
</P>
<P>
The late bid for gold in London was $367.00 an ounce, up from $366.50 late 
Thursday. The Zurich late bid was $366.50 an ounce, up from Thursday's $366.35. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $369.15 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's 
$366.35. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures prices climbed to three-month highs on the Chicago Board of Trade 
following an Agriculture Department report indicating U.S. wheat stocks were 
about 80 million bushels below market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, corn and soybean futures retreated, livestock and 
meat futures were mixed, energy futures were mostly higher and precious metals 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 2.25 cents to 7.75 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in December at $4.0725 a bushel, the highest settlement for a 
near-month wheat contract since June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Corn was 1.25 cents lower to 1.50 cents higher, with December at $2.33 a 
bushel; oats were 1.75 cents to 2 cents lower, with December at $1.44 a bushel, 
and soybeans were 1.50 cents to 4 cents lower, with November at $5.68 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released after the close of trading Thursday, the USDA projected 
wheat stocks for June 1, 1990, at 1.91 billion bushels compared to trade 
estimates averaging 1.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushels compared to 
trade estimates averaging 1.89 billion, and the USDA estimated soybean stocks 
as of Sept. 1 at 182 million bushels, compared to trade estimates averaging 159 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA report provided the main support for the wheat market but traders said 
a surge in export sales of U.S. grains during the week also helped boost wheat 
futures and limited losses in the corn and soybean markets. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
ahead of the USDA's quarterly hogs-and-pigs report, which estimated the U.S. 
swine herd as of Sept. 1 at 58.4 million head, about the same as last year and 
very close to market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said near-term hog futures may open lower Monday in reaction to 
another section of the report that showed pork producers had kept slightly more 
hogs for marketing than traders had expected. 
</P>
<P>
The hog report was perceived as slightly bullish for the deferred contracts, 
though, because it indicated pork producers had backed off a bit on their fall 
breeding intentions, which would imply a smaller supply of hogs next spring and 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Most energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders 
were encouraged by OPEC's ability to reach an agreement to limit production. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver futures fell moderately on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
despite a drop in the dollar, amid pre-weekend profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures ended 30 cents to 90 cents lower, with October at $367.20 an 
ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 4 cents lower, with October at $5.226 an ounce.

GROUCHO IS SECRET WORD FOR ACTOR FERRANTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Ferrante has a thing for Groucho Marx. 
</P>
<P>
"I was almost weaned on tapes and records of him," said the 26-year-old actor. 
"I knew his inflections, I knew his rhythms. I read everything I could on him. 
And I think my love for the subject comes through." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante's tribute -- and impersonation -- is at the core of "Groucho: A Life 
in Revue," a musical bio/character study written by Arthur Marx (Groucho's son) 
and Robert Fisher. Under Marx's direction, it opens Sunday at the Pasadena 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
It all began in 1984, when Ferrante decided to mount a one-man Groucho show in 
a church hall in his hometown of Pasadena. It went so well that, the next year, 
he replicated it for his senior project at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I might as well capitalize on it -- combine my drama degree and my 
interest in the Marx Brothers," he reasoned. This time, however, he invited 
Groucho's offspring, Arthur and Miriam. And they loved it. But mostly, they 
loved him. 
</P>
<P>
"Arthur said, 'If I ever do a show about the Marx Brothers, I'd like to use 
you,' " Ferrante recalled. The year after he graduated, they began workshopping 
the show. In the resulting version (completely different from Ferrante's 
original piece), the actor plays Groucho at four stages in his life: as a 
15-year-old innocent; a the-other-morning-I-shot-an-elephant-in-my-pajamas 
comedy and film star; the older "You Bet Your Life" Groucho, and the 
85-year-old cynic. 
</P>
<P>
A Kansas City production came first, followed by an 11-month New York run 
(culminating in a 1987 Theatre World Award) -- and last year, a London 
engagement. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of humanity in the show," Ferrante said. "It's more than a 
couple of guys doing the Marx Brothers. There are 10 songs, a plot, a story. 
It's about his relationship with his brothers, his wives. Les Marsden plays 
Chico -- and he also plays the harp as Harpo. Anastasia Barzee plays 13 
different roles: chorus girls, wives, reporters, a USO girl. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante is convinced the fascination with Groucho is ever-strong. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at his movies -- they've never left the public scene," he said. "You 
still see his TV reruns. At this show, we get audiences from 7 to 90. Little 
kids come up saying, 'I love Harpo.' I can't tell you how many letters I got 
from people in Europe when I was in London. There are Marx Brothers fans 
everywhere. I really think he touched a nerve: He was the funniest man America 
ever produced." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante traces his own Groucho attraction to early childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 10, I was watching 'A Day at the Races,' " he said. "It really 
appealed to me visually; they were so undisciplined and irreverent." 
</P>
<P>
Besides dressing up as Groucho on Halloween, Ferrante fostered a Groucho 
memorabilia collection that included posters, books, records, films and a 
scrapbook of clippings. 
</P>
<P>
"Then two years ago, Arthur took me to a Bekins warehouse and there (were) 85 
years of Groucho's life: awards and scripts, photographs, wigs, props. He gave 
me the glasses Groucho wore, a cigar box, some hats. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He also cherishes the memory of a 1976 meeting with Groucho (a year before the 
comedian's death), when Marx held a book-signing session at the Ambassador 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"(Groucho) shuffled up to the podium, his eyes were glassy, he was slurring his 
words," Ferrante said, wincing. "I thought, 'My God, my hero from "Duck Soup" 
-- and he's ancient. How could this happen?' " Yet within minutes, the 
familiar, wisecracking Groucho bubbled to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"He was able to muster up those reserves of energy and perform. Then he just 
shuffled off. It's that memory of him that I think of when I'm playing him 
old." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his obvious affection for his subject, Ferrante thinks the show is more 
than a glossy tribute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a 'Mommie Dearest,' " he said. "But it's not a whitewash of his life, 
either. It's honest. See, I know all of his flaws. There were obviously severe 
problems with women -- he had three divorces -- stemming from his relationship 
with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very eccentric with his money, probably because he'd lost $250,000 in 
1929. And he wasn't always apt to give love freely. But he was an extremely 
loyal friend, a hard worker. His kids say he was a great father when they were 
young. But he had a very insecure streak." 
</P>
<P>
The actor denies any insecurities about work that requires submerging his own 
identity to Groucho's. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's the focus," Ferrante said. "That's OK. If audiences go away with a 
respect for the work, that's what's important. I don't sit around saying, 
'Gosh, I wish I were like Groucho.' That's never been a problem. I like myself 
too much to give myself over to that. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is the perfect time to do this; I'm at an age where it's good, not 
destructive. And when I get home, I don't do Groucho. I almost make a point of 
avoiding the wisecracks. I don't care about being 'on.' It doesn't matter to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
He's convinced that there'll be life after Groucho. 
</P>
<P>
"If this production goes well, I'd like to do it in Boston, San Francisco, 
Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington -- and then move on to the next job," 
Ferrante said. "Oh, I wouldn't mind doing the film version, because his story's 
never been told." 
</P>
<P>
There are no regrets for the detour: "When I graduated from USC, I was about to 
enter UCLA's theater production program -- and this show came up. I figured it 
was too good an opportunity to miss. And I was absolutely right."

ABC is developing a television movie about President Bush's World War II 
exploits and has hired Roger Ailes, the President's campaign strategist, to 
co-produce it. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should a total stranger do it?" asked Ailes, who produced "The Mike 
Douglas Show" and other TV programs before becoming media mastermind of the 
Bush 1988 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
ABC declined to discuss any details about the movie, citing "competitive 
reasons." But insiders said that the TV film is being planned for the 1990-91 
season. There has been no casting and no script has been written for the 
project, Ailes said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was a Navy carrier pilot in the Pacific during the war, was shot down 
by Japanese anti-aircraft flak in September, 1944. He was rescued by a 
submarine after bailing out of his plane. Bush's decorations in the war 
included the Distinguished Flying Cross. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's new in-house production unit, headed by former ABC Entertainment 
President Brandon Stoddard, will make the movie for the network, with Stoddard 
and ABC staffer Ilene Berg producing along with Ailes. 
</P>
<P>
The project apparently originated when writer-producer Stuart Birnbaum 
envisioned a "PT 109"-type movie for Bush. That was the film about President 
John F. Kennedy's World War II exploits that came out during his 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Ailes, who has his own communications company in New York, said both he and ABC 
had been thinking about a movie that would focus on Bush's war years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been in my mind for some time," he said, before adding that, "Ilene 
called me. . . . I guess it came from the phone call from Ilene." 
</P>
<P>
He said discussions about the movie began three or four months ago, after he 
had already been talking to the network about producing a different movie. "It 
wasn't that they came to me specifically for this. I was working with Ilene 
already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Birnbaum, who also will produce the movie, said in an interview Friday that he 
got the idea for the movie on inauguration day last January. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching the inaugural parade and there was a replica of the 
fighter-bomber Bush had flown on a float and I said, 'Who's doing his "PT 109?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Birnbaum, who previously wrote the films "Summer School," "The Zoo Gang" and 
"Smokey and the Bandit III," said that he took the idea to ABC, where it was 
greeted enthusiastically. The next step was to get Ailes involved, he said: "We 
went to him, obviously because of his relationship with the president -- his 
access. He was the best guy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The White House was initially concerned about the approach being taken, 
Birnbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's badly done, it's not something they would want to happen," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard, Berg and Ailes met with the President at the White House for 20 
minutes Sept. 15 and he agreed to cooperate with the network. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush will neither appear in nor participate in the making of film, he is 
making numerous research materials available, including letters that he wrote 
to his mother during the war, Birnbaum said. Barbara Bush also will be involved 
in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Staffers at the Democratic National Committee had not heard about the movie or 
Ailes' involvement until a reporter called. Press secretary Ginny Terzano 
commented: "They've hired a person who specializes in myth. This is the same 
man who turned an actor into a President. Now he's going to get the opportunity 
to turn the President into an actor." 
</P>
<P>
Ailes was brought in to coach Ronald Reagan during his 1984 presidential 
campaign after his stumbling performance in the first candidates' debate with 
Democratic nominee Walter Mondale. Ailes said he does not consider his 
involvement in the movie a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how there could be a conflict," he said. "There's only one story 
and we're going to tell it. Tell me, where is the conflict?" 
</P>
<P>
Birnbaum agreed that some eyebrows may be raised over Ailes' involvement, but 
added, "I'm sure some Republican eyebrows were raised when ('PT 109') came 
out." He maintained that the movie will be nonpartisan.

AFI LIFE ACHIEVEMENT AWARD TO BE GIVEN TO DAVID LEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
The American Film Institute is going to have some great clips to show at its 
March 8 dinner next year. Sir David Lean, the director of such wide-screen 
epics as "Doctor Zhivago," "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Bridge on the River 
Kwai," has been named by the institute as the 18th recipient of its prestigious 
Life Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old Englishman, who is still looking ahead to his planned 
adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel "Nostromo," is the eighth director and 
the first foreigner to be honored by the AFI since it began presenting its 
"living legend" award in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Director John Ford was the AFI's first Life Achievement Award recipient and 
Gregory Peck its most recent. In between, the honor -- presented at a glamorous 
A-list Hollywood dinner that is taped for later network broadcast -- has gone 
to such actors as James Cagney, Lillian Gish, Bette Davis, Fred Astaire, Gene 
Kelly and Barbara Stanwyck, and to directors Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, 
Billy Wilder, William Wyler, John Huston and Frank Capra. 
</P>
<P>
"Lean joins a distinguished group of individuals who have made enormous 
contributions to America's film heritage," said AFI chairman Gene Jankowski in 
announcing the name of the institute's 1990 winner. 
</P>
<P>
Lean, a Quaker who was not allowed to see movies as a child, stepped through 
the looking glass at the age of 19 when he got a job serving tea at an English 
studio and actually had to rise to the job of gofer. He later finagled work as 
an assistant film editor, working on newsreel footage captured during the early 
'30s, and was the credited film editor on the 1938 "Pygmalion." 
</P>
<P>
His began his directing career doing the action sequences for the 1942 war film 
"In Which We Serve," but his first step toward an AFI award came with his 1945 
adaptation of Noel Coward's "Brief Encounter." The film earned the then 
37-year-old Lean the first of six Oscar nominations. 
</P>
<P>
He received his second nomination the following year for "Great Expectations," 
and 10 years later began a streak that included nominations for "The Bridge on 
the River Kwai" (1957), "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), "Dr. Zhivago" (1965), and 
"A Passage to India" (1984). He won the Oscar for "Kwai" and "Lawrence." 
</P>
<P>
The only film he has done since 1957 that did not earn him an Academy Award 
nomination was the 1970 Irish landscape spectacle "Ryan's Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Critics are divided on Lean's overall position on the honor roll of film 
directors. Certainly, his epics show the deliberateness of a visual stylist and 
a meticulous storyteller; Lean has managed only 16 movies in 47 years of 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
For Hollywood, he was definitely the right director at the right time. With 
television spawning America's first generation of couch potatoes, the big 
screen had to get a lot bigger, and with "The Bridge on the River Kwai," Lean 
gave audiences plenty to look at while managing to keep the story as big as the 
image. 
</P>
<P>
Lean has not worked as much as he might have liked in the last two decades, 
because of the prohibitive costs of his kind of spectacle. For years, he and 
his writing collaborator, Robert Bolt, were planning an authentic historical 
version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." At one time, it was going to be done as two 
movies, each one costing about $30 million, then as an eight-hour miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Lean abandoned the project when it was clear no one would put up the money he 
needed to realize his vision. The film was eventually made in 1984 by director 
Roger Donaldson for Orion Pictures under the title "The Bounty."

INSURER SEEKS LOWER RATES FOR GOOD DRIVERS; 
</P>
<P>
STATE FARM PROPOSAL RELIES ON DRIVING RECORD IN FIRST STEP TOWARD COMPLYING 
WITH PROP. 103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Farm, California's largest auto insurance seller, has asked Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie for permission to lower its rates for most good 
drivers throughout the state from 2% to 20%, while compensating by sharply 
increasing rates for problem drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The rate changes represent a step toward complying with a key provision of 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Giving a number of examples of how increases and decreases would apply, State 
Farm said rates for most good drivers would decline from 5% to 15% in central 
Los Angeles, by 2% to 19% in San Diego, by 2% to 12% in eastern San Francisco 
and from 3% to 18% in rural Northern California counties, if the company gets 
its way. 
</P>
<P>
No Orange County examples were given, but a company spokeswoman said the 
general pattern would apply to Orange County as well as to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Good drivers are defined as those with no more than one conviction for moving 
traffic violations in the previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hikes for Problem Drivers 
</P>
<P>
State Farm is proposing to pay for the decreases by sharply increasing the 
rates of problem drivers, no matter where they live, who have been convicted of 
two or more traffic violations in the previous three years. Most of these 
drivers, according to examples released by the company, would see their rates 
increase anywhere from 29% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman said that only "a very small number" of drivers in the 
areas mentioned would fall outside these ranges of increases or decreases, if 
Gillespie approves the new rate schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The new schedule is revenue neutral, in that State Farm would end up with the 
same amount of total premium income statewide after the various increases and 
decreases. 
</P>
<P>
The filing with Gillespie marks the first time any major company has moved in a 
detailed way toward compliance with the provision in Proposition 103 that 
mandates that a driver's record, the number of miles driven, and the years of 
driving experience must be more important in setting auto insurance prices than 
the neighborhood in which he or she lives. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all the major insurance sellers have opposed downgrading of 
neighborhood-based pricing, known in the business as the territorial rating 
system. And State Farm Friday emphasized that its proposed rates would, on 
balance, only "slightly diminish" the importance of neighborhood as a pricing 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the rate adjustments are being made on a 
territory-by-territory basis and that the average urban driver would continue 
to pay more than the average rural or suburban driver. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, State Farm's filing with Gillespie said that the company intends 
in the new rates to "place more emphasis on driving safety record, miles driven 
and years of driving experience as required by Proposition 103." In doing this, 
it necessarily diminishes the importance of where a driver lives as a pricing 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the proposed rates by State Farm mark the first time a major 
insurer has abandoned an attitude of total resistance to implementation of 
Proposition 103 since it was approved by the electorate last November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News Conference Monday 
</P>
<P>
There has been no reaction yet by Gillespie to State Farm's requests. The 
insurance commissioner, however, has called a news conference for Monday in San 
Francisco to lay out emergency regulations of her own for applying the pricing 
provisions of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm said that time constraints will not permit implementing the 
commissioner's regulations immediately, and it asked for permission to apply 
its own new rates from Nov. 8 onward "for a reasonable time." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has in the past expressed great hesitancy in accepting the 
Proposition 103 rating criteria literally and downgrading neighborhood-pricing. 
But she has said there will be changes in ratings, and she may not wish to do 
less than State Farm has now indicated it is willing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has repeatedly suggested it would be impossible to bring down rates 
for good drivers in urban areas without raising them in rural areas. But the 
State Farm proposal notably finds a way to reduce rates for such drivers 
everywhere, mainly by putting the burden on problem drivers. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm, with about three million California customers, has 17% of the total 
auto insurance market in the state, and has long been an important influence 
over the rest of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But a lobbyist for several other major companies expressed unhappiness Friday 
about State Farm's rate requests. Asking not to be identified, he said that 
State Farm does less business in inner city areas than other big companies, 
such as Allstate, so it is easier for it to agree to cut its rates for good 
drivers in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spokesmen were also reserved about State Farm's rate proposal, 
suggesting it does not go far enough toward reducing the differential in prices 
between urban and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103 and chairman of Voter Revolt, 
said, for instance, that State Farm should be required to lower rates for good 
drivers far more. 
</P>
<P>
Conway Collis -- the state Board of Equalization member who has been endorsed 
by Rosenfield for insurance commissioner when the post becomes elective next 
year -- said the State Farm proposal "begins to bring down rates for good 
drivers in Los Angeles and elsewhere, but not nearly to the extent that they 
will be after 103 is fully implemented." 
</P>
<P>
State Farm, in its filings with Gillespie, also gave other examples of how 
rates might fluctuate by driver according to how many miles were driven each 
year, how many years of driving experience he or she had, and how many 
accidents there had been. 
</P>
<P>
When these factors were included in the calculation, the increases and 
decreases varied. 
</P>
<P>
The examples given all involved a 1988 Ford Taurus "GL" four-door sedan with a 
fairly complete coverage package and multiple cars in the household. However, 
the State Farm spokeswoman said the examples were meant to be representative of 
patterns in other situations as well. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, in one example, household drivers with no traffic convictions, 
driving more than 7,500 miles a year and with nine years of driving experience, 
under age 50 and having a policy in force at least six years would get a 
decrease of 6.5% in premium, from $1,018 for each six months to $952. 
</P>
<P>
If one driver in the household had one minor traffic conviction in the previous 
three years, the drivers covered would still get a 6.5% decrease, from $1,018 
to $952. But if one driver had two convictions, the household drivers would get 
a 29.1% increase, from $1,018 semiannually, to $1,315. 
</P>
<P>
If the drivers had no convictions and no chargeable (at-fault) accidents and 
the car was driven less than 7,500 miles a year, with the principal driver in 
the household having five to nine years experience and being a single female, 
the premium would drop by 15.1%, from $1,474 to $1,252. If, on the other hand, 
the vehicle was driven more than 7,500 miles a year, the decrease would be only 
4.9%, from $1,474 to $1,402. And if there had been one chargeable accident, 
there would be a 7.6% increase, from $1,582 to $1,702. 
</P>
<P>
If the drivers had no moving traffic convictions, no chargeable accidents, the 
car was driven more than 7,500 miles a year, and the principal driver had less 
than three years driving experience and was a single male, the increase would 
be 18.6%, from $3,270 to $3,878. 
</P>
<P>
If one driver in the household had one conviction of a minor traffic violation, 
no chargeable accidents, the car was driven more than 7,500 miles per year, and 
each driver had nine years or more of driving experience (14 years for a single 
male) and is under age 50, and the car was driven to and from work more than 30 
but not more than 100 miles a week, there would be a 15% decrease, from $1,415 
to $1,202. 
</P>
<P>
The examples demonstrate how changes in the facts about a drivers' situation 
can lead to dramatically different rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE RATES WOULD BE LOWERED 
</P>
<P>
The map shows neighborhoods in Los Angeles where State Farm, California's 
largest auto insurer, is proposing to reduce rates for most "good drivers" in 
November between 5% and 15%. At the same time, most drivers in these areas with 
more than two traffic violations in the last three years would be given rate 
increases close to 30%. The proposed rate adjustments are designed to bring the 
company into compliance with a key provision of Proposition 103 calling for a 
reduction of neighborhood price differentials.

TWO LEADING O.C. MUSEUMS STUDY MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum -- at 71, Orange County's oldest museum -- has asked the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum, the county's most prestigious, to discuss the 
possibilities of a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees of the Newport Harbor museum have agreed to discuss the issue "as a 
matter of courtesy" and voted Thursday to name a committee of their own to meet 
with the three-member Laguna committee, a Newport museum spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Claudette Shaw, president of the Laguna museum's board of trustees, said any 
merger most likely would combine administrative services and fund-raising 
efforts, rather than mix the museums' collections and operations in a single 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Though many of the proposed changes would therefore be behind the scenes, she 
said, consolidation could result in jointly organized, bigger or more 
comprehensive exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Shaw said, "there is no concrete talk of the merger yet," and 
discussions would strictly be exploratory. Any discussion "will be about 
whether there are advantages or disadvantages" to any kind of merger, said 
Charles Desmarais, the Laguna museum's director. 
</P>
<P>
Newport museum spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber stressed that agreement to talk with 
Laguna is "not at all indicative of any feelings we have pro or con. . . . It's 
not an endorsement" of a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "it does seem that some sort of alliance would serve us both well," Shaw 
said, stressing again that the merger would occur "way down the road, if it 
could even be accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna museum, which has an annual operating budget of $1.2 million, has 
been plagued by a persistent deficit that totaled $72,000 during the fiscal 
year ended Aug. 31. Shaw said, and at least one arts funding expert has agreed, 
that the museum is not facing a financial crisis. But, Shaw added, this nagging 
deficit has caused museum officials to examine ways of addressing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A merger is one of these possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Newport Harbor museum is in the midst of a $50-million drive to 
build a new facility in Newport Beach. Though it is believed that the campaign 
is past the halfway mark, the amount raised so far has not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais said the sort of merger to be discussed has not been specified. But 
Shaw said the merger, as informally discussed among museum trustees and 
community members, would be an administrative rather than physical one. 
</P>
<P>
"The proponents of the (merger) see some way of combining our administrations," 
Shaw said. "That way, both of us could keep our expenses to a minimum and keep 
(fund-raising efforts) under one administration so that we would not compete 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"No one I know of, even those strongly in favor of a merger, wants us to close 
up shop in Laguna and dissolve into Newport Harbor Art Museum," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, at least one Laguna Art Museum member -- Thomas T. Tierney, who 
resigned as a museum trustee on Tuesday after serving six years and who is a 
member of the Newport Harbor Art Museum -- strongly endorsed a merger that 
would be both administrative and physical. 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that such a move would be "heroic" and "smart business," Tierney, 
president of the Tustin-based Vita Tech International vitamin firm, said it 
would create a "truly regional museum with a major collection of art of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be a custom fit because the two museums have dissimilar but 
mutually supportive collecting and exhibiting policies. There is very little 
overlap," Tierney said. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna museum, with 20,000 square feet of gallery space, has a 3,000-piece 
collection and focuses on the history of California art from the late 19th 
Century to the present. The Newport museum's 1,800-piece collection is 
primarily composed of post-World War II California art. Currently, the Newport 
museum has 11,000 square feet of gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
Tierney further noted that a physical merger could mean more gallery space for 
the Laguna and unification of both museums' memberships, which could aid the 
Newport museum's building campaign. Laguna has 3,100 members and Newport has 
5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tierney went so far as to suggest the "sale of the present Laguna Art Museum" 
ocean-bluff property that he said is worth well more than $1 million, money the 
"succeeding entity" certainly could use. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people (who) would want to maintain a satellite presence in Laguna," 
Tierney said, "but it must be remembered that Laguna Art Museum is a private 
museum, not a part of the city or integrated into city funding. It is 
independent and could exist anywhere it wants to." 
</P>
<P>
Tierney said that five years ago, the Newport museum approached the Laguna 
museum for exploratory merger discussions. Nothing materialized, he said, 
because Laguna museum officials wanted to expand their site -- which they did 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the problems with the museum's fiscal strength has been the 
increased costs of running its expanded, renovated building, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she feels that "it's important to the city of Laguna and our supporters 
that we keep a presence there." Another option being considered, she said, is 
relocation within Laguna Beach to a site with more convenient parking. The 
museum has only on-street metered parking. "People say 'I'd get down there more 
often, but parking and traffic is a terrible problem,' " Shaw reported. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said the museum's trustees approved a letter this week to be sent to 
Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, expressing interest in the Village Entry 
Project, a planned development near Forest and Broadway in Laguna Beach, near 
the site of the Laguna Beach Festival of Arts.

SENATE VOTES TO PROHIBIT COUNTING OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the 
Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in 
the 1990 population count. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stunned," said Santa Ana City Council member Miguel A. Pulido. Pulido and 
other Santa Ana council members say that the 1980 census substantially 
under-counted its population at 215,000. The city has been lobbying hard to 
have its illegal alien population -- estimated at 50,000 -- included in the 
1990 count. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action came on a voice vote, despite arguments from the Bush 
Administration and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and 
unworkable. Just before the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against 
killing the proposal to bar aliens from the count. 
</P>
<P>
A Senate-House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against 
including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped 
from a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the State, Justice and Commerce 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Urge Veto 
</P>
<P>
Even if the prohibition survives, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher has 
said that he would ask President Bush to veto any bill that comes to his desk 
with such a provision. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are the number of seats in Congress for California, Florida, New York, 
Illinois, Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis 
of next year's census. 
</P>
<P>
Federal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so 
millions of dollars in grants and other funds made available on a per capita 
basis would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have said California could lose up to $300 million in federal 
aid if illegal aliens were uncounted. Santa Ana has estimated its potential 
loss at $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pulido and county advocates for poor Latino residents expressed 
concern that the decision would promote fear and intimidation in the community. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, before the federal immigration reform act, the number of illegal 
aliens in Orange County was estimated at 229,000, ranking it just behind Los 
Angeles County in California, a county official said. There are no current 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we have close to 50,000 people in the city that have qualified 
through the amnesty process for legal residency," Pulido said. "Those 
individuals, when asked or challenged about their status, can be legitimately 
concerned. I think the census's attempt to question them could be misconstrued 
as an attempt by the immigration service to get information." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Acosta said he "was saddened" by the Senate's action because 
the city was determined "to count every single person, and I know that (now) 
we're going to to suffer from this monetarily." 
</P>
<P>
But Pulido said he believes the House of Representatives will not allow the 
prohibition to survive, especially since it killed an earlier, similar effort. 
</P>
<P>
The issue cuts across partisan lines in the Senate, with Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) arguing against the White House position on grounds that 
including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Seats Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens," Dole 
argued. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost 
House seats after the 1980 Census, and that California and New York -- centers 
of illegal immigration -- each gained seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," Cochran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the 
decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx 
of immigration beyond the legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of 
population," Wilson said, adding that those states should receive additional 
federal aid to cope with the added problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action would also have an impact on smaller California cities 
without substantial Latino populations because census population figures play 
an important role in Community Development Block Grant formulas, said Don 
Vestal, Westminster city planner. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster is following a recommendation by the Census Bureau to form a 
Complete Count Committee of officials and community leaders to help ensure 
cooperation from all city residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that it's in our best interest to get as complete a count as we can," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Development Block Grant formula, among other things, Vestal said, 
includes use of income figures and percentage of lower income residents in the 
city. "In addition to just counting heads, they're getting economic information 
of the city that will affect us in the future," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria McDonough, director of Abrazar Center, an elderly-assistance center for 
Latinos in Westminster, said the senators' action shows they have no 
understanding of the impact of illegal immigration to California communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you count them or not, the undocumented residents are still going to 
impact federal dollars in our community. And whether we like it or not they're 
here and here to stay," McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, representatives from the census office in Santa Ana have 
visited such social centers as Abrazar and others and told center staff people 
that they intend to count "everyone, regardless of where they came from," 
McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their big thing was, 'We do not care about the origins of where these people 
are from, but, more importantly, their impact to local economies,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment, census officials in Santa Ana referred media inquiries 
to the regional office in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Dove, assistant regional director for the U.S. Census in charge of 
outreach, said that despite the Senate's decision, the census bureau "really 
doesn't know how to go about finding who was legal or illegal." 
</P>
<P>
"But we have a mandate to follow that law, and we would have to find out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical 
because the Census Bureau has already printed questionnaires that do not 
contain any question about legality of residence. 
</P>
<P>
For 190 years, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the federal 
government has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in 
accordance with the Constitution's provisions. "Fiddling with the numbers" now 
will destroy confidence in the census results, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's action was sharply criticized by Undersecretary of Commerce 
Michael Darby, but he voiced hope that it would be reversed by a Senate-House 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be 
unconstitutional but literally impossible," Darby said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he is "optimistic, cautiously optimistic," that House 
conferees would resist the Senate-approved ban and not force Bush to veto the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was 
shocked by the Senate's decision. "It is going to have a dramatic and 
disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," Moreno said. "People are going to 
be discouraged from participating." 
</P>
<P>
A Census Bureau spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence," said 
bureau spokesman James Gorman. "If Congress passes a law that says we will or 
will not count people, we will do what it says."

KIDNAP-RAPE SPURS ACTION ON GENETIC-TESTING LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reaction to the kidnap and rape this week of a 12-year-old girl in 
Huntington Beach, the Board of Supervisors appeared ready Friday to finance 
California's first genetic-testing lab for the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said that such a crime lab might have prevented the attack on 
the girl because the suspect who has been arrested had been acquitted on a rape 
charge in April -- after prosecutors were unable to obtain genetic-evidence 
test results in time for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, California police agencies must send their genetic evidence to 
laboratories on the East Coast and wait -- sometimes several months -- for the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Supervisor Don R. Roth called on the board to order a 30-day study on 
how the county could pay for a so-called DNA lab and how the cost might be 
shared with the state or other law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder -- who lives in the Sea Cliff on the 
Greens gated community where the kidnaping occurred last Sunday -- asked the 
board to fully fund the lab immediately at a cost of $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals are scheduled to be considered at the board's meeting next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to spend any more time on additional studies or reports," Wieder 
wrote in a letter to the other supervisors. "By acting today, the board can 
respond to this critical need in a responsible and timely manner that may 
prevent another innocent child from becoming a victim." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the different proposals, one county official said it appears that the 
lab will be funded: "It's just a question of how much and when." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department's request for a genetic testing lab has been rejected 
by the county for the past two years because of the government's tight fiscal 
condition. In the meantime, Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates has organized a private 
fund-raising campaign to pay for the lab. 
</P>
<P>
So far his efforts have raised $80,000 in contributions, including about 
$25,000 from a fund-raiser last week. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Dennis LaDucer said Friday that department officials were 
happy to hear of the board's plans to consider funding for the lab. But he said 
it would be best to finance the facility immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been studying this for two years," LaDucer said. "Personally, I think 
the issue has been studied enough." 
</P>
<P>
After such extensive study, La-Ducer said he is unaware of any other genetic 
testing lab in California. The state, however, is considering a plan for 
regional genetic labs throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
One of the items to be studied in Roth's proposal would be the possibility of 
Orange County's facility being designated as the state's regional lab, reducing 
the cost to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The board must act to ensure that public and private funds are utilized 
appropriately . . . and that no unnecessary time delays or fiscal waste is 
made," Roth wrote in his proposal to the other board members. 
</P>
<P>
DNA testing has been used in criminal trials and investigations in at least 30 
states, including California. 
</P>
<P>
DNA -- or deoxyribonucleic acid -- is the fundamental molecule in human life 
that carries a genetic code unique to every individual. That unique code can be 
gleaned from DNA found in samples of human hair or bodily fluids. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Joseph Borges, the 29-year-old transient construction worker who was 
arrested Tuesday as a suspect in the kidnap and rape in Huntington Beach, was 
acquitted in a controversial rape trial involving an attack on a housewife in 
Anaheim Hills on Oct. 29, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge prevented prosecutors from introducing genetic evidence 
in that case because it would have delayed the trial for several months. But 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Bauer said the genetic evidence "was very persuasive 
and very strong evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the same guy, it would have prevented this kidnap and rape because 
he'd still be in custody," Bauer said.

EXTENT OF WETLANDS REVIVAL IS CRUX OF HOUSING DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
WHERE BUILDER, BIRDS COLLIDE

<P>
Years ago, before the word development was uttered anywhere near its edges, the 
wetlands on the old Hellman Ranch in Seal Beach were teeming with birds -- owls 
and sparrows, migrating blue herons and egrets. 
</P>
<P>
But over the years, what environmentalists say was once about 100 acres of 
marshy nesting grounds for avians has largely disappeared, leaving what they 
say is today about 26 acres of severely degraded wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The Wetlands Restoration Society, a Seal Beach environmental group, would like 
to see the wetlands restored in their entirety, but the property they are a 
part of -- a parcel situated north of Pacific Coast Highway and west of Seal 
Beach Boulevard, is zoned for residential use, and developers have proposed to 
build hundreds of houses on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Mola Development Co. of Newport Beach has for several years been submitting 
proposals to build on the property. Its latest proposal calls for 355 
single-family houses on 149 acres that was once part of Hellman Ranch. It is 
the largest undeveloped area in Seal Beach to be zoned for residential use. 
</P>
<P>
Mola disputes environmentalists' claims that the wetlands ever comprised 100 
acres at any time in this century. Company project manager Kirk Evans said that 
as part of its development agreement with the city, the firm has promised to 
restore the 26 acres of wetlands there now, plus another 10 acres. . 
</P>
<P>
That promise, however, is not enough for the Restoration Society, which was 
formed two years ago and now has about 150 members. The group opposes any 
development that would encroach on what they see as the original 100 acres of 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the society wants to see the development confined to just 20 acres on 
a hillside next to Seal Beach Boulevard overlooking the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we've built up so much, should we continue?" said Galen Ambrose, 
one of the society's founders. 
</P>
<P>
Although what Mola proposes to do with the wetlands would be an improvement, 
Ambrose said, their plans still would result in a destruction of bird habitats. 
</P>
<P>
The wetlands are under what is known as the Pacific Flyway, a path birds use on 
their migrations north or south, Ambrose said. The birds stop to rest and feed 
in the big swampy areas under the flyway, so that any building near the 
wetlands will make them less appealing to the birds. 
</P>
<P>
"If you build out everything, there is nothing left to use anymore," Ambrose 
said. "When the birds go, that's a sign that humanity is going." 
</P>
<P>
The El Dorado chapter of the National Audubon Society of Long Beach also 
opposes the development, according to chapter representative Mary Parsell. 
</P>
<P>
The chapter has been monitoring the wetlands for the past 10 years, and it has 
determined that it is one of the homes of the the Belding's savannah sparrow, 
an endangered species in California, Parsell said. 
</P>
<P>
Parsell said that the sparrow, which is native to Southern California, does not 
migrate. Therefore, she said, the loss of a nesting place will further reduce 
the bird's chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
Evans disagrees with that view, arguing that the company's improvements to the 
wetlands will aid any wildlife there. The company will, Evans said, return 
tidal flow to the wetlands and also replant native flora such as pickle weed, 
one of the plants in which the endangered sparrow nests, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report prepared by consultants for the city shows that 
the project will not be harmful to the wetlands, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we are taking a tree away, we are replacing it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company knows that it must not infringe upon the wetlands, Evans said. In 
1988, the state Coastal Commission rejected a previous -- and also 
city-approved -- plan for the Hellman Ranch property to build 770 single-family 
houses and a golf course because the project would have encroached on six acres 
of wetlands, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Beach City Council is scheduled to consider granting final approval to 
the project Oct. 9, but the real test will come when the Coastal Commission, 
which has the final say, considers the matter. The commission is scheduled to 
hear the proposal during the week of Nov. 13, according to Charles Damm, 
director of the commission's South Coast District. 
</P>
<P>
Damm said the commission staff will evaluate the project to determine how it 
would affect the wetlands and whether it would provide appropriate recreational 
facilities and public access, and whether any geological hazards have been 
addressed. The staff is to present its recommendation to the commission around 
Nov. 1, Damm said.

LETTERS WARN OF RETALIATION FOR GUNMAN'S 7-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LE KIM DINH and JAMES ROBBINS, Times Staff Writers

<P>
At least two Orange County Vietnamese newspapers received letters from a 
shadowy anti-communist group threatening unspecified retaliation for the recent 
prison sentencing of a Vietnamese-American for a 1986 political assassination 
attempt in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The open letter, signed by the group Task Force U7 called the seven-year prison 
term for confessed gunman Be Tu Van Tran "a grave offense to anti-communist 
fighters." 
</P>
<P>
Though the letter specifically criticized the sentence imposed by Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald, it did not say how or against whom 
any retaliation would be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentence imposed on Be Tu Van Tran by Superior Court Judge Fitzgerald is 
particularly discriminatory and constitutes a grave offense to all 
anti-communist fighters. Therefore, we, of Task Force U7, will resolutely take 
revenge for Be Tu and all other comrades in arms," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Be Tu or Little Tu, is the alias for Tran, a 33-year-old Santa Ana deliveryman 
who confessed to the March 18, 1986, attack against Tran Khanh Van, a 
Westminster businessman and former Saigon housing minister. The letter also 
called Tran "a model Vietnamese." 
</P>
<P>
Tran became a hero among strident anti-communist factions in the local 
Vietnamese community after he claimed credit for stalking Van and shooting him 
twice, critically wounding him. 
</P>
<P>
Van has been living in hiding since the attack, which took place a few weeks 
after he was quoted in a Los Angeles Times Magazine story as saying that "the 
only way to change Vietnam's repressive Marxism is to work with those who will 
become the next generation of leaders." 
</P>
<P>
"The act against Van was just an ordinary punishment aimed at cleansing the 
community of a crook masquerading as a politician," the letter said. "But the 
man, an opportunist and a loudmouth, has used ill-gotten money to turn the 
incident into an important political case." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Mike Ratliff of the Westminster police said detectives took the threats 
seriously and that an investigation is under way. Garden Grove police also are 
looking into the letters. 
</P>
<P>
"There has always been a constant background of ultraconservative thought in 
Little Saigon," Ratliff said. "The people are very astute politically." 
</P>
<P>
"This type of thing happens a lot," added Westminster Detective Marcus Frank, 
"and we have to take it seriously. But we really can't trace a letter like that 
because we are dealing with copies of the letter and a disguised writing 
style." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was typewritten in Vietnamese, postmarked Santa Ana, and signed by 
Task Force U7 of the Vietnamese Party for Restoration and Communist 
Eradication. 
</P>
<P>
Yen Do, publisher of the Vietnamese newspaper Nguoi Viet in Garden Grove, which 
received a copy of the letter and published a story about it Friday, said the 
extremist group has been sending similar communiques to the 40-odd Vietnamese 
newspapers in and around Little Saigon since 1981. But the group's membership 
and whereabouts are still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Do said he interpreted the letter to mean that the group's intended target was 
Van -- not Judge Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Tu Do newspaper in Westminster also received a copy of the 
letter but did not intend to print it, said an editor who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
After Tran's arrest, his lawyer had predicted that his client would spend only 
a few months in jail for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sept. 15, swayed by a psychiatric report warning that Tran was a 
possible manic-depressive who had expressed only "superficial remorse" for the 
shooting, Fitzgerald imposed a seven-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said Tran made a "slow plea," which means he waived his right to a 
jury trial, leaving Fitzgerald to decide Tran's sentence based on records from 
his preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Tran was sent to the Chino Institution for Men for a mental diagnostic study, 
Fitzgerald said, and when Tran returned he still believed that all people in 
the community with any communist ties should be killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't let him go," Fitzgerald said, "or he would have gone out and killed 
someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the letter did not specifically threaten Fitzgerald, he was 
mentioned prominently. "You have to take these kind of threats seriously," 
Fitzgerald said. "They sound like a volatile, dedicated group." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said that if he was being threatened, it would not be the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"My life has probably been threatened more than any other judge (in Orange 
County)," he said. "I guess I'm the meanest mother on the mountain. I get a lot 
of serious, dangerous cases." 
</P>
<P>
"I look in the rear-view mirror a lot," he added. "(But) If you have to alter 
your life style, then the crooks have won." 
</P>
<P>
In the Little Saigon area of Westminster and Garden Grove, the letter was 
roundly condemned by civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not condone threats, whether clear or hidden, and wherever they come 
from," said Mai Cong, president of the Vietnamese Community of Orange County 
Inc. "All of us have lived through so many years of war and we have come here 
to live in peace and under the rule of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Giang Thanh Le, a local developer, noted that while Fitzgerald was not 
specifically threatened, the letter could "be easily understood (as a) hidden 
threat against him. As such, this could have an extremely negative effect on 
the community as a whole, unless the voice of the community is also heard, and 
I am sure as law-abiding citizens, we all condemn any threat of violence."

STORE REOPENS AFTER FUMES TAINT FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forced to close on its "Grand Reopening Day" when customers became ill after 
eating contaminated food, a Ralph's supermarket reopened Friday morning after 
the store replaced part of its inventory, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The company had voluntarily agreed to close its store at 25401 Marguerite 
Parkway when at least two Mission Viejo families complained of stomach cramps 
and nausea after eating cooked and packaged food bought from the store. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials traced the odor contamination to a heavy-duty cleaner called 
Limasol that was used by a contractor who recently remodeled the store. 
</P>
<P>
Al Marasca, executive vice president of marketing, said non-toxic fumes had 
permeated some of the soft packages that were later removed from shelves. He 
declined to specify the losses incurred because of the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sizable," Marasca said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Ralph's will try to recover its losses from the contractor. The store 
will also make refunds or replace goods that were tainted by the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The store had planned "a grand reopening" Thursday to celebrate its $2-million 
remodeling.

POLICE CAPTURE MAN, 22, SUSPECTED IN BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's investigators said they arrested a 22-year-old janitor 
early Friday in connection with a string of burglaries in Mission Viejo that 
began Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said 11 deputies had put the home of 
Donald Alan Driver under surveillance Thursday night. Driver was captured 
shortly after midnight in the 27000 block of El Moro as he was allegedly 
rifling through a purse that later was determined to have been stolen from a 
nearby house earlier that night. 
</P>
<P>
Driver was being held on suspicion of residential burglary, first-degree 
burglary and resisting arrest. Sheriff's officials said there have been nine 
thefts by a cat burglar in the Mission Viejo area between Aug. 15 and Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said credit for the investigation goes to Deputy Neil Hansell, who is 
assigned to the Mission Viejo area. Hansell developed the lead that resulted in 
the department's staking out Driver's home, Olson said.

3 GAYS, DISNEYLAND SETTLE DISCRIMINATION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three gay men who sued Disneyland over the right to slow-dance with one another 
have dropped their lawsuit in exchange for a pledge by the amusement park not 
to discriminate based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, Eric Hubert, Christopher Drake and Jeffrey Stabile Jr., who 
were UCLA students at the time, sued Disneyland, claiming their civil rights 
were violated in late 1987 when, they said, a security guard allegedly told 
them that "touch dancing is reserved for heterosexual couples only." 
</P>
<P>
The men dropped the lawsuit earlier this month, shortly before the case was to 
have gone to trial in Orange County Superior Court. Leroy S. Walker, the Los 
Angeles attorney representing the men, declined to comment beyond a 
one-paragraph statement saying: "Disneyland reaffirms that its written policy 
prohibits discrimination based upon sexual orientation. The lawsuit has been 
dismissed by the plaintiffs." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said Disneyland has acknowledged the suit's being 
dropped but had no other comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Such Suit 
</P>
<P>
The men's suit was the second against the park over the issue of homosexual 
dancing. Andrew Exler of Palm Springs sued Disneyland in 1980, when the park 
banned all homosexual dancing, after security guards had stopped him as he was 
fast-dancing with a male partner. A four-year court battle ensued. Finally, in 
May, 1984, a Superior Court judge ruled that the guards' action violated the 
men's civil rights. Disneyland subsequently lifted its ban on same-sex fast 
dancing. Disneyland eventually reached a settlement with Exler in which the 
park paid his $25,000 in legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
Exler said the settlement of the latest suit shows that Disneyland recognizes 
that the action of its security guards was discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that it took nearly 10 years for the Happiest Place on Earth to 
admit that they must operate under the civil rights laws just like any other 
business," Exler said. 
</P>
<P>
Exler said he went dancing at Disneyland earlier this month with a group of 
about 15 homosexual men and women and that they were permitted to dance with 
one another during fast and slow songs. 
</P>
<P>
"The final chapter has been closed on this issue," he said.

FOES OF IRVINE RIGHTS LAW CALLED OUTSIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE BEL BRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Louis Sheldon, the Anaheim anti-gay activist, and other people who do 
not live in Irvine are helping to organize and direct the campaign to deny 
homosexuals protection under Irvine's controversial human rights ordinance, 
critics charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the involvement of Sheldon and the others an intrusion into the city's 
affairs, City Councilwoman Paula Werner expressed concern over outsiders 
becoming active in issues that she said should be decided solely by residents 
of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly intend to investigate how we as a City Council might better 
formulate our campaign rules and restrictions so that Irvine residents and 
workers are having the impact on matters regarding Irvine, not the outsiders 
like the ones who have gotten into this campaign," she said. "I don't think 
outside interests should be interfering with Irvine politics." 
</P>
<P>
Werner's comments came after it was revealed that Sheldon and other 
non-residents had lent their support to the Irvine Values Coalition, a group 
primarily composed of religious fundamentalists that is trying to delete the 
words "sexual orientation" from the rights ordinance. A proposal to that effect 
will appear on the Nov. 7 city ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Werner also serves as a board member of Irvine Citizens United, a group formed 
to oppose the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Citizens United said two men who helped write the ballot argument to 
exclude homosexuals from the ordinance are not Irvine residents. The group 
identified them as Joe Dallas, a Garden Grove counselor, and Dr. Lawrence J. 
McNamee, a radiologist in Whittier who lives in La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
McNamee worked with Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) on Proposition 
102, a proposal that would have required that the names of AIDS patients be 
registered with the state. It was rejected by California voters in the last 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to contact Dallas and McNamee for comment were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Boone, a member of Citizens United, said many Irvine residents resent 
"being controlled and run by people completely outside the city. It is plain to 
see that Rev. Louis Sheldon is the 'grandfather' of this organization, and all 
the rest are his children. The similarities are endless." 
</P>
<P>
Boone pointed to the similarity in the names and agendas of Sheldon's 
Traditional Values Coalition and the Irvine Values Coalition. Last month, 
Sheldon's group led a protest against a gay pride festival in Santa Ana. He is 
waging a recall effort against that city's mayor and three council members 
because the festival was allowed to be held. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Peotter, chairman of the Irvine Values Coalition, at first strongly 
denied that the two organizations had been in contact but he later conceded 
that "a few conversations" took place with Sheldon. Sheldon went further, 
saying the Traditional Values Coalition had been advising and shaping the 
Irvine group since its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been serving them since the very early beginnings of it, which is only 
natural because we have an interest in this thing too," Sheldon said. "I just 
spoke to them and gave advice to Scott a few days ago. We chitchat about 
different things quite often." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Miller, treasurer of Irvine Citizens United, criticized Peotter's 
group for bringing in outsiders to give the organization legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Peotter responded that residency was not a primary concern in bringing in 
people to work on the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
'We are bringing in people that look credible; residents were of secondary 
concern," Peotter said. "It is not being run by those guys, but sometimes we 
use the expertise of people like William Dannemeyer. We are all just amateurs 
at this." 
</P>
<P>
If voters approve the Nov. 7 ballot measure, the words "sexual orientation" 
would be deleted from the human rights ordinance. The City Council adopted the 
ordinance to ban discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, physical 
handicap, marital status or sexual orientation.

MISSION VIEJO STOPS SANTA ANA COLD; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE STANDS TALL AS NO. 1-RANKED DIABLOS ROLL, 30-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garner Hicks, Santa Ana's standout tailback, couldn't get through it. Jesse 
Rosas, the Saints' quarterback, couldn't see over it. And defensive end Oscar 
Wilson, their play-stopper, wilted under its pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Mission Viejo High School and its mighty momentum rolled over another 
opponent Friday night, this time with a stifling 30-0 victory over Santa Ana at 
Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
For those 3,000 or so who came to watch, Mission Viejo, 4-0 and the county's 
top-ranked team, put on a dazzling defensive show. The Diablos frustrated Santa 
Ana at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Mission Viejo's offense fared well too, with junior quarterback Tim 
Snowden completing eight of 18 passes for 217 yards, a touchdown and an 
interception before being replaced by Don Disbro early in the third quarter. 
Mark Gaw led the Diablos ground game with 75 yards and two touchdowns, on runs 
of 28 and 1 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Mission Viejo's defense that gave its offense most of its 
opportunities, forcing seven fumbles, three of which led directly to 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We got our tail kicked," a grim-looking Santa Ana Coach Dick Hill said. "You 
don't make mistakes like that and expect to live." 
</P>
<P>
Or at least you don't expect to gain any considerable ground as third-ranked 
Santa Ana (3-1) learned in the game's opening minutes. Hicks, who prior to 
Friday had gained 457 yards in three games, was held to 49 yards on 20 carries 
and only three yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
And Rosas, who entered the game with 303 yards and five touchdowns, saw his 
performance go to pieces thanks to the Diablo defense. Rosas, who completed 
four of 10 passes for 55 yards and an interception, was continually mauled and 
battered by Mission Viejo's aggressive defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
For those Mission Viejo fans who starting yawning after they realized that 
their team, which in four games has outscored its opponents, 162-13, was on its 
way to another rout, the successive bloopers in the second quarter probably 
held their interest. 
</P>
<P>
With Santa Ana trailing, 10-0, and on its own 8-yard line midway through the 
second quarter, Rosas dropped back to pass, saw no one open, and decided to 
toss a backwards pass to Hicks, who apparently didn't realize Rosas' 
intentions. The ball dropped in the end zone, and after some confusion, Mission 
Viejo cornerback J.J. Fortune fell on the ball for a touchdown, giving Mission 
Viejo a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very opportunistic tonight," Mission Viejo Coch Mike Rush said. "We 
took advantage of forcing the ball. It comes down to basics. 
</P>
<P>
"The name of the game is smash ball on our side."

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: TAKE A NUMBER FOR SOME ALL-STAR TELEPHONE TALK

<TEXT>
<P>
Please don't mention this to my superiors, but I just spent $131 on 1-900 calls 
to the Jose Canseco and Buddy Ryan hotlines. I guess I got a little carried 
away during the research phase of this column. 
</P>
<P>
And who wouldn't, what with Canseco, the Oakland Athletic slugger, dispensing 
pearls of wisdom on such topics as his alleged steroid use ("totally untrue") 
and his growing number of speeding tickets, including the one he received for 
traveling 120 m.p.h. in his red Jaguar. ("Obviously, when you buy an exotic 
car, they're extremely fast," he patiently explains. "Sometimes they tend to 
get away from you.") 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they do, Jose. One moment you're obeying all federal laws and then 
-- oops -- you notice the speedometer is 65 m.p.h. over the posted speeds. 
Happens all the time to us Chevette owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, try not to speed," pleads Jose, "and try to keep it under 55 -- if you 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Will do. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ryan, the outspoken coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, offers up 
insights galore into the violent and complicated world of pro football. For 
instance, want to know why offenses are scoring so much? Just press the No. 2 
on your touch-tone phone and you get this controversial response from Ryan: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a combination," he says breathlessly. "Ever since they've 
legalized holding, the scoring has gone up. It seems every year they want more 
points. That's the way it goes, so you have to do something to counteract 
that." 
</P>
<P>
And they say there are no more geniuses. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, the entire 1-900 library grows. Canseco and Ryan are the obvious 
pioneers, but word is that other sports celebrities soon will provide their own 
valuable insights for $1 the first minute and 75 cents for every minute 
thereafter. According to phone company sources, the list will include: 
</P>
<P>
Ram owner Georgia Frontiere (1-900-PHONE-GA). 
</P>
<P>
Frontiere reveals why her team still is called the Los Angeles Rams, despite 
not setting cleats in LA County for the past 10 seasons. ("Oh, I don't know -- 
I just like the sound of it," she says of Los Angeles. "The Anaheim Rams sounds 
so, well, pedestrian.") Frontiere also explains her reluctance to meet with 
members of the local media. ("Take a hike, creep.") 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger and Padre star Steve Garvey (1-900-CEL-BACY). 
</P>
<P>
Garvey welcomes all female callers with, "I didn't do it. I can prove it. I 
didn't even know her. We were just friends, acquaintances, at best." Garvey 
offers advice on the wonderful world of dating. ("Don't do it. I beseech you, 
don't do it.") 
</P>
<P>
Former Ram Eric Dickerson (1-900-IM-GREAT). 
</P>
<P>
This is not one of the longer audio programs available. There are two Dickerson 
segments: "How'd you get my number?" and "This better not be a collect call." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz (1-900-LOU-TALK). 
</P>
<P>
Hear Holtz whine and poor-mouth his way into a frenzy. ("We stink. We are 
simply not a good football team right now. I know we're favored by 31 over 
Purdue, but the oddsmakers aren't the ones playing the game, we are. And I 
can't see us winning by more than three touchdowns, which is absolutely 
pitiful, awful, unacceptable . . .") 
</P>
<P>
Angel owner Gene Autry (1-900-FOR-SALE). 
</P>
<P>
The gentle Autry, victimized by another ill-timed Angel September swoon, 
explains why he is considering selling the team. ("I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE," he 
says. "NO MAN CAN. THE CUBS WON; WHY CAN'T WE? WHY? WHY? WHY? (much sobbing) 
I'VE HAD IT. JACKIE, GET ME MARVIN DAVIS ON THE PHONE.") 
</P>
<P>
Boxer Mike Tyson (1-900-NEED-FOE). 
</P>
<P>
Tyson details the daily difficulties of living life as a superstar and the 
unending search for a worthy opponent. An excerpt: "Drove car to store. Drove 
car through store. Got confused on which pedal did what. Had to drop store 
owner; he was complaining about broken plate glass window. Used two jabs and a 
right cross. Easy. Drove home and studied Shakespeare. Pondered "To be or not 
to be" line. Still don't get it. Talked to Don King, my promoter, about my next 
fight. He asked me how I'd feel about boxing a newcomer. I said, 'Tony 
Mandarich? Mark Gastineau? Who?' He said, 'That lady in England who jumped into 
the ring and starting hitting her son's opponent with the heel of her shoe.' 
'No problem,' I said. 'I'll drop her in three rounds. Easy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City Royal Bo Jackson (1-900-BO-KNOWS). 
</P>
<P>
Jackson provides a succinct analysis of the Raiders' growing problems ("Al 
doesn't know football") as well as his thoughts concerning the possibility of a 
franchise move. ("Bo don't want to know Sacramento.") 
</P>
<P>
Angel vice president Mike Port (1-900-MR-TRADE). 
</P>
<P>
Port explains why the Angels failed to make a single deal down the stretch, 
despite losing pitcher Chuck Finley to an injury. ("Uh . . . ") Port also lists 
the many reasons why the Angels still don't have a leadoff hitter. ("Uh . . .") 
</P>
<P>
That's all for now. After all, I've got an expense account to fudge.

Irvine High School ran the ball up and down the field against Woodbridge Friday 
night, with little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Vaqueros, they also managed to cross the goal line when 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine needed a 71-yard drive to pull out a 19-13 victory in front of 2,800 at 
Irvine. It was a victory that seemed assured in the first half, but one that 
nearly got away. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some letdowns tonight in the second half," Irvine co-head Coach Rick 
Curtis said. "We needed to move the ball like we did early in the game." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Vaqueros returned to their first-half form, they had squandered 
a 12-0 halftime lead and trailed, 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
With 7 minutes 50 seconds left, Irvine took possession on its 29-yard line and 
proceeded to lose 14 yards on a bad handoff. Not the best way to start a 
game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to get a break," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Shad Vickers, who gained 141 yards in 24 carries, provided one. He 
burst 19 yards up the middle on second down and the Irvine was moving forward 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros (2-2) consumed 6:07 on their final drive. They ran the ball 13 
consecutive plays, including a 26-yard scramble by quarterback Deron McCoy for 
a first down on the Woodbridge 24. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Randy Martin swept right, then cut inside a block by guard 
Brad Stammer, and scored on a eight-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one great drive," Curtis said. "We really pulled together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Martin and Vickers took turns shredding the Warrior defense. By halftime those 
two had both outgained the Woodbridge offense and Irvine had a 12-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers scored twice in the second quarter on one-yard runs. But both times the 
Vaqueros failed on the conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"Woodbridge has great speed on defense and they pursue the ball really well," 
Curtis said. "But that hurt them tonight. We were able to spread them out, then 
cut back inside for some big gains." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's offense ground to a halt in the third quarter, mainly because it 
didn't have the ball much. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge (2-2) opened the second half with a 16-play, 89-yard touchdown 
drive. Irvine appeared to stop the Warriors four times on the drive, but each 
time quarterback Gary Fishel came up with a big play. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest was a 20-yard touchdown pass to Steve Madden. 
</P>
<P>
A Vickers fumble gave the Warriors the ball on the Irvine six. Two plays later, 
Fishel scored on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine ran only four plays in the third quarter and gained only seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some mistakes in the third quarter, but our biggest problem was we 
didn't have the ball," Curtis said. "Once we got, and held on to it, we were 
all right."

SERRA GETS THE JUMP ON SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddleback High School just couldn't guess right in its shell game against 
Serra Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Serra, with four backs in the backfield and an option offense, spread the 
football around and left Saddleback guessing which back had the football. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners guessed wrong -- a lot. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, fullback Dennis Gerard (21 carries, 174 yards and two 
touchdowns) and quarterback Fred Safford (21 carries, 97 yards) were harboring 
the football most of the night as Serra defeated Saddleback, 22-7, in front of 
500 at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring out who had the ball wasn't the real problem, Saddleback Coach Jerry 
Witte said. "We knew who had the ball. We just couldn't figure out a way to 
tackle them. Their linemen were doing a good job and (Gerard) was doing a great 
job. When he wants to run hard, he runs hard. We couldn't stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Nor could Saddleback (1-3) seem to get its offense started, thanks in part to 
pressure from linebacker Alex Marcelin and the Serra blitz, and, in part, to 
poor execution. Saddleback gained 188 yards but five turnovers and dropped 
passes stalled Roadrunner drives until it got a little bit of help from Serra 
late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With Saddleback trailing, 14-0, Jose Arceo recovered a Safford fumble at the 
Serra 37 and Paul Delgado eventually hooked up with Robert Reyes for 31 yards 
and a touchdown to avoid a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Serra (4-0) showed it owned the running game early, marching 92 yards in eight 
plays and scoring in less than three minutes in the first series of the game. A 
34-yard burst by Lamont Daniel advanced the ball to the Saddleback six, setting 
up Gerard's six-yard scamper and Serra led, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback mounted a drive from its 29 to Serra's 45 with the help of a 28-yard 
completion from Delgado to Juan Acuna (three catches, 26 yards). But Serra's 
Clayton Lopez intercepted Delgado's pass and Serra scored off the turnover on a 
34-yard run by Jerald Henry. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers had 366 yards, all on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"They had big holes and great backs," Witte said. "When you get that 
combination, I'm surprised they didn't score more." 
</P>
<P>
Serra would have scored more if it had a reliable field-goal kicker. 
</P>
<P>
Serra turned the ball over on downs rather than attempting a field goal from 
the Saddleback 12 in the second quarter after a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, on fourth and nine with the ball on Saddleback's 14, Alex 
Rico intercepted a pass by Safford.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY RIPS WESTMINSTER; 
</P>
<P>
COUGARS' SOLLIDAY SUCCESSFULLY TAKES TO AIR IN 31-12 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Capistrano Valley High School tried something new Friday night. Usually a team 
that grinds it out on the ground, the Cougars took to the air and defeated 
Westminster, 31-12, at Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's game, Capistrano Valley quarterback Tony Solliday had attempted 
39 passes in three games. Solliday threw 29 against Westminster, completing 19 
for 263 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton said passing more is necessary if the 
Cougars (4-0) are to continue winning. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out there expecting to air it out and try some things," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
That the Cougars felt they could do some experimenting might have something to 
do with their opponent, the winless Wildcats (0-4). 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley took a 24-0 lead in the first half behind the passing of 
Solliday and the catching of Dave Poltl, who had eight catches for 96 yards in 
the first half. Poltl finished with 10 catches for 134 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougar ground game was far from quiet. Running back Paul Shaheen gained 93 
yards in eight carries in the first half and scored the Cougars' first 
touchdown on a 14-yard run. Shaheen carried the ball only once in the second 
half, gaining 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best hits of the night happened after the ball was dead. Numerous 
unsportsmanlike penalties were assesed to both teams. The game threatened to 
get out of hand as a couple of sideline clearing brawls almost erupted. 
</P>
<P>
That the game was physical seemed to fire up Westminster. The Wildcats, who 
couldn't do much against Capistrano Valley in the first half, outscored the 
Cougars, 12-7, in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster running back Bruce Tran scored on a 16-yard draw play in the third 
quarter and quarterback John Shipp threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Dave 
Spence in the fourth. But by that time, Capistrano had largely turned the game 
over to reserves.

FIELD GOAL TRIES FAIL; WESTERN EDGES OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Using a ball-control offense and taking advantage of some lucky breaks, Western 
High School held off Ocean View, 9-7, Friday in a defensive struggle at 
Huntington Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had a little more luck than they did tonight," Western Coach Jim 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Western's luck included surviving a 12-men-on-the-field penalty as Ocean View 
kicker Sean Rogers missed a 45-yard field goal attempt with 1:31 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty gave the Seahawks (2-2) a second chance, but they couldn't convert 
it. Rogers barely missed the potential game-winner from 35 yards out with 31 
seconds left, kicking wide to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Western took a 3-0 lead on its opening drive, converting on a 27-yard field 
goal by Gilbert Brito. Western's only touchdown came on a one-yard run by Corey 
Manliguines in the third quarter, which made the score 9-0. MIKE ITAGAKI

LOARA'S GROUND GAME RUNS DOWN MAGNOLIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS KAISER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loara High School might be called too one-dimensional, but that's fine by Coach 
Herb Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take a win any way I can get it," Hill said. "We'll face reality next 
week when we play El Modena." 
</P>
<P>
This week, the Saxons' first priority was to establish the run, which they did 
effectively and early in a 38-0 victory over Magnolia Friday night at Handel 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Loara senior tailback Coy Collins rushed for 194 yards in 17 carries, and 
scored four of the team's six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Saxons gained 387 yards rushing, using nine ballcarriers. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to run tonight," Hill said. "The running game is our thing, but you 
do have to have some balance." 
</P>
<P>
But the Saxons (4-0) were not exactly balanced. They completed only one of two 
passes for six yards. A third attempt resulted in a pass-interference penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Saxons also dominated Magnolia (0-4). Quarterback Elliot 
Parker had three passes intercepted and was sacked four times. DENNIS KAISER

Estancia High School rolled along with a 40-0 nonleague victory over Laguna 
Beach in front of 1,000 Friday at Laguna Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' Josh Wojtkiewicz ran for 125 yards in 20 carries and scored two

nine carries and scored one touchdown. The Artists are now 0-4. 
</P>

Estancia scored with 1 minute left in the first quarter on Thomas' 15-yard run. 
Alex Vazquez kicked the extra point. 
</P>

With 10:16 left in the second quarter, quarterback Dan Ucker hit wide receiver 
Mike Aulet with a 30-yard touchdown pass. Vazquez's kick made it 14-0.

Wojtkiewicz followed with touchdown runs of two and 9 yards, as Estancia made 
it 27-0 at the half. VINCE AGUL

DANA HILLS WINS DESPITE SLOW NIGHT OFFENSIVELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Hills High School Coach Don Douglass had his defense -- and a 
controversial call -- to thank after a 9-7 victory over Santa Ana Valley Friday 
at Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass praised his defense after the game, which put Dana Hills record at 
4-0, the best start of the coach's eight years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, we didn't do a thing; we were fortunate to win," Douglass said. 
"But defensively, we played great." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills managed just one scoring drive all night, going 79 yards in 12 plays 
on a march that wound up with a nine-yard touchdown pass from senior 
quarterback Grant Taylor to senior tight end Andy Marrone with 4:27 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That, along with Ryan Harrison's 28-yard field goal in the second, accounted 
for all of Dana Hills scoring. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown drive began on a controversial play. Santa Ana Valley punter 
Jesse Brooks had punted from his own 28 to the Dolphin 1-foot line, but Santa 
Ana Valley was called for a personal foul for batting the ball out of bounds, 
and the ball was re-kicked. 
</P>
<P>
This time Dana Hills took over on its 21-yard line, where it started its 
winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Calls are calls; every once in a while you get a key call that can change a 
game," Santa Ana Valley Coach Dan Castanon said. "This one made a big 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley (1-2-1) scored first when defensive back Rome Manson 
intercepted Grant Taylor's second pass of the night and returned it 60 yards 
for a touchdown with 4:04 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills was led by Matt Carvalho, who had 101 yards on 26 carries. LEN HALL

Orange Coast 9, Cypress 6 -- Cypress (8-4, 1-2) led, 3-2, in the first quarter 
when Orange Coast went on a 4-0 run. Arturo Sanchez's two goals spurred the 
outburst and Orange Coast held on. Dave Eagan also scored two for Orange Coast 
(9-2, 3-0) and Brian Oylear had 16 saves. Craig Garcia had three goals for 
Cypress and goalie Pat Ruzgerian had 12 saves.

OCC'S YOUNGBLOOD GETTING A FRESH START

<P>
For a couple years after high school, Tyrone Youngblood stood by and watched 
his friends play football. 
</P>
<P>
He had been a standout on the 1985 Marina High School team that reached the 
Southern Section semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, though, he was tired of football and frustrated by his 
failure to receive any scholarship offers. So he sat out the 1986 season. He 
stayed away in 1987, too, but started to miss playing. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he began a comeback last fall at Orange Coast College at age 20. He 
played very little, but this season, he's starting at nose guard. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood and his teammates play host to Mt. San Antonio in a Mission 
Conference game tonight at 7. 
</P>
<P>
During those two years away from the game, Youngblood had many chances to watch 
friends he has played against move on to four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood finally started college because he was tried of wasting time. He 
wanted to start his life. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, I started to miss it," Youngblood said. "I would watch a game 
and start to get emotional. I would get excited and my veins would start to 
come out. It could be football or boxing or something like that. I'm just 
emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Youngblood spent most of the time sitting on his emotions as well 
as the bench. He was behind Bruce Dubois, an all-Mission Conference nose guard. 
When Youngblood did play, it was either on special teams or very late in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
So, he returned this season with a strong determination to start. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more mentally tuned into what I need to do," Youngblood said. "I had to 
make an adjustment. I realized it was time to listen to the coaches and stop 
trying to do things on my own." 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood, who is 6-foot-1 and 230 pounds, spent a majority of his high school 
career at Marina in opponents' backfields. In his senior year, he had a 
school-record 16 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
When he came to OCC, the coaching staff wanted him to switch to linebacker to 
take better advantage of his speed, but Youngblood wanted to stay at nose 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
"He's best when he used his quickness," OCC defensive line coach Rich James 
said. "He's doing much better this season. It could be because he realizes this 
is his last chance." 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood has been in on 10 tackles in two games this season despite being 
hurt for parts of each game. He has seven tackles for losses, including three 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Sacks are what I really want," Youngblood said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's Mission Conference games, all at 7: 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Antonio (2-0, 1-0) at Orange Coast (1-1, 0-1) -- Mt. San Antonio is 
ranked second in Southern California, thanks in large part to sophomore running 
back Leonard Russell. He has run for 403 yards and scored three touchdowns in 
56 carries. But OCC did hold him to 60 yards, his single-game low, last season. 
</P>
<P>
OCC Coach Bill Workman is looking for a better effort tonight than in last 
Saturday's 36-17 loss to El Camino. Workman said that was the worst effort his 
team has put forth in a game in his four seasons at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (2-0, 1-0) at Fullerton (1-1, 0-1) -- Among the best games played in 
Southern California each of the last three years has been between these teams. 
Fullerton hung on to win, 38-36, last season to up its series lead to 12-5-1. 
El Camino beat Fullerton, 27-26, in 1987 on its way to an 11-0 season and the 
J.C. Grid-Wire national championship. Fullerton survived a last-second missed 
field goal attempt in a 33-31 victory in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (2-0, 1-0) vs. Rancho Santiago (2-0, 1-0) at Santa Ana Stadium -- 
Rancho Santiago is averaging 44 points a game, but this will be the first solid 
opponent the Dons have faced. A victory would help establish Rancho Santiago as 
an early conference favorite. Long Beach is led on offense by former Bolsa 
Grande High School standouts quarterback Damon Fisher and running back Travin 
Lui. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar (0-2, 0-1) at Saddleback (0-2, 0-1) -- Saddleback is trying to avoid 
its worst start in the college's history. There's one thing certain about 
Palomar: The Comets will pass. Quarterback Scott Barrick has 653 yards after 
two games. He is 59 of 111, but has six interceptions and only two touchdowns.

LINCOLN S&amp;L'S PARENT WINS RULING; CREDITORS HOPEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Phoenix denied government motions Friday to throw out the 
bankruptcy petitions of 11 subsidiaries of insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan, keeping alive the hopes of creditors that they may get back a portion of 
the $363.1 million owed them. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, together with other rulings and comments by U.S. District Judge 
Richard M. Bilby, was a "big victory" for Lincoln's bankrupt parent firm, 
American Continental Corp., said Brad Boland, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides had acknowledged previously that Friday's hearing was a key one in 
the legal battle between American Continental, which filed for bankruptcy 
protection on April 13, and federal regulators, who seized Irvine-based Lincoln 
on April 14. The collapse of Lincoln could ultimately cost taxpayers $2.5 
billion, making it the largest S&amp;L failure ever. 
</P>
<P>
Had the motions been granted, regulators would have had a free hand in dealing 
with the 11 subsidiaries, which hold most of Lincoln's assets, and American 
Continental's hopes for reorganizing itself would have been dashed. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Wood, a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. staff lawyer assigned to the 
subsidiaries, said the denial of the motion will inconvenience rather than 
jeopardize the agency's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The subsidiary cases are going forward," she said. "The ruling will not affect 
what we do so much as hinder us in doing it." 
</P>
<P>
One obstacle to the FDIC's effort Friday was a motion filed Monday by the 
creditors committee, including about 22,000 holders of nearly $200 million in 
American Continental bonds, to consolidate the bankruptcies of the 
subsidiaries, as well as the receivership of Lincoln, into the American 
Continental bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
A committee lawyer, Donald Gaffney of Phoenix, argued that a racketeering suit 
brought by federal regulators two weeks ago alleges that the parent and all its 
subsidiaries constituted one enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone somewhere has to deal with the whole ball of wax," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
In a folksy but direct manner, Bilby told a courtroom packed with nearly 100 
lawyers and government agents that he wants American Continental, the FDIC and 
the creditors committee to start negotiating to settle the bankruptcy cases.

Liquidation of At Ease Sought: Four creditors have asked the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court in Santa Ana to liquidate At Ease, the Newport Beach-based retailer known 
for its expensive men's clothing. In the involuntary bankruptcy petition filed 
this week, the creditors said they are owed more than $533,689 by At Ease. The 
action comes in the wake of At Ease closing stores in Santa Ana and Westwood. 
The company still operates stores in Newport Beach and Pasadena and is planning 
to open a new store in San Francisco in the next two weeks. At Ease likely will 
seek to convert the involuntary Chapter 7 filing to Chapter 11, which would 
provide it protection from creditors while it reorganizes, said the firm' 
attorney, Bill Lobel of Lobel Winthrop &amp; Broker in Irvine.

ART NOTES / CATHY CURTIS: SEARCHERS FIND A CROP OF POTENTIAL MUSEUM DIRECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newly formed search committee to find a director for the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum has already located several potential candidates, so the museum board 
has postponed action to hire a professional search firm, according to 
spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board has decided against appointing an interim director. 
</P>
<P>
Margie Shackelford, the museum's director of development, said various 
departments -- administration, curatorial, development and operations -- will 
continue to report to their designated committees on the board. The search 
committee, named Thursday, consists of five museum trustees: Harry Bubb, 
committee chairman; Donald Bren and Jack Shea, both major collectors of 
contemporary art; Joan Beall, and Rogue Hemley. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Consey, the museum's current director, will leave Oct. 3 to become 
director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The board reaffirmed that the director's duties and responsibilities would 
remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
NEW DEAN IN TOWN: The Art Institute of Laguna Beach has named Russ E. Lewis 
academic dean and vice president for academic affairs, replacing Richard Carp, 
who resigned in June to become academic dean of the Kansas City Art Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 41, who began his new job this week, comes from Kendall College of Art 
and Design in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he was vice president for academic 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
He holds master's degrees in anthropology from Michigan State University and in 
East Asian anthropology and sociology (from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, 
Mich.); a Ph.D. in resource development from Michigan State, and a doctor of 
laws degree from Valparaiso University School of Law.

'REPLICATE OF BAND SAYS A REMOTE YES TO NOSTALGIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Mike Boehm's review of the Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman and Howe concert at 
the Pacific Amphitheatre ("Replicate of Band Says a Remote, Pat Yes to 
Nostalgia," Calendar Sept. 7): 
</P>
<P>
As an attendee of Wednesday's Greek Theatre show, I would like to (discuss) his 
comments, "note-for-note renditions of originals" and "the band forgot that a 
concert should have a bit of human touch, a stroke of immediacy that says a 
moment is being lived, not relived." 
</P>
<P>
Several compositions were reworked and rearranged into medleys; some songs were 
expanded by the introduction of whole new melodic, instrumental, even vocal 
sections, and I was pleasantly surprised theatrically as well. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the concert, Jon Anderson walked down the main right aisle 
toward the stage (something fresh and unexpected) singing an acoustic rendition 
of "Time and a Word." With ingenious, gradually increasing (volume), each 
(musician) briefly soloed on a couple of his instrumental compositions that 
were part of the group's repertoire when it was last together, all of 16-plus 
years ago. This heightened my awareness of each member's contribution to that 
group and increased my anticipation as to how dynamic the interaction would be. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't have to wait very long. ABWH launched into mostly old songs in the 
first half of the show. Some new wrinkles: the expanded instrumental intro to 
"Long Distance Runaround" and the glorious flourish of driving melody at the 
end of "I've Seen All Good People." The second half opened with "Close to the 
Edge" but finally brought out the most dynamic cuts from the (new) ABHW album. 
</P>
<P>
The pacing was rewarding (moving from "Brother of Mine" to "The Meeting" to 
"Order of the Universe"). Even the predictable encore, "Starship Trooper," was 
given a healthy injection of difference through the interpolation of short 
vocal sections from the "Relayer" and "Tales From the Topographic Oceans" 
albums ("Soon" and "Nous Somme Du Soleis," respectively). 
</P>
<P>
These aspects made the show fresher for this longtime fan. The band members 
were in top form, introducing an invigorating menu of new group compositions 
that highlight various dynamics the ABWH combination produces. 
</P>
<P>
I look forward to seeing other incarnations of (this band) in as many 
combinations as (its members) desire, as long as they keep leader Anderson's 
valuable artistic credo: Always create and explore music's possibilities to 
make you feel alive and positive.

FRANCISCAN WAY OF LIFE TESTED; 
</P>
<P>
EXECUTIVE SWAPS SUIT FOR BLACK TUNIC OF NOVICE FRIAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a typical morning two years ago, Dan Pacholec would have donned a blue 
business suit, wolfed down a bowl of Wheaties and driven to his job in retail. 
</P>
<P>
Now on a typical morning, Friar Dan dons a black tunic and belts it with a cord 
knotted three times, to symbolize poverty, chastity and obedience. 
</P>
<P>
He slips outside, where the mists rise off the corn fields. With a long rosary 
suspended from his waist, he steps to the sound of gently clicking beads. 
</P>
<P>
Friar Pacholec is a novice, a new member of the Franciscan order. He and eight 
fellow novices are spending the year at the St. Joseph Cupertino Friary and 
Novitiate. They live as a community, study the Franciscan way of life, and help 
AIDS victims and the homeless in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
It is a year apart from friends and family, a year to grapple with life as a 
friar before any vows must be taken. 
</P>
<P>
The path is not an easy one. Statistically, only one in three novices will 
persevere in their "calling" to the religious life. 
</P>
<P>
Life at the friary -- the Franciscans bristle at the word monastery for they do 
not live in retreat -- is an odd mixture of medieval and modern, mystical and 
mundane. 
</P>
<P>
Pacholec drinks Diet Coke, watches movies on the communal VCR and cuts the vast 
lawn with a new riding mower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emulates St. Francis 
</P>
<P>
Yet in his every act he strives to emulate St. Francis of Assisi, who renounced 
his life as a knight and a fabric merchant to found the religious order in 
1221. A man of meditation as well as preaching, he sought solitude at times in 
the mountain hermitages of central Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The friary is that kind of pastoral place, though with a booming county around 
it, the surroundings have grown more noisy. 
</P>
<P>
Father Bart Karwacki, now the novice director, recalled hiking several miles to 
the friary in Clarksville in 1965, when he was a novice. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky if we saw one car," he said. Now, "I wouldn't even attempt it." 
</P>
<P>
When the friary was built 60 years ago, it was a working farm in a community of 
farmers. There were no teen-agers driving Trans Ams, no shopping malls, none of 
the conspicuous consumption that has become a cliche of the region's richest 
suburb. Still, Karwacki said, the changing atmosphere has had little affect on 
the novices, who renounce their need for such luxuries and rarely venture off 
the friary grounds. 
</P>
<P>
At 31, Pacholec is the oldest novice in the group, though several others had 
careers in everything from nursing to computer programming. 
</P>
<P>
His was a "typical Catholic upbringing" in the factory town of Holyoke, Mass., 
where his father worked as a die maker. The local parish was Franciscan, and he 
admired the friars' balanced commitment to prayer and community service. 
</P>
<P>
At Amherst College in Massachusetts he joined the Christian Assn., studying the 
Bible and sharing prayer. His thesis compared two men's discoveries of faith, 
one through intellect and one through emotion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Delayed 
</P>
<P>
Though he originally planned to become a friar after graduating in 1983, family 
concerns led him to delay the move. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he became a sales executive for Albert Steiger's, the retail company 
for which he had worked since high school. As he climbed the corporate ladder, 
he did his best to uphold his convictions, renting a modest apartment, going to 
Mass and mingling work with counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the business atmosphere seemed wrong. One colleague, faced with a problem 
employee, would say, "I think we should take a markdown on him." 
</P>
<P>
His relationship with his girlfriend also left him somehow unfulfilled, though 
his family thought she was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find that one right person that fills all your needs, when you 
have a feeling deep down that you can give a lot -- and maybe more than you can 
give to one person." 
</P>
<P>
So he left it all behind. He sold his beloved 1977 Plymouth Volare and, a year 
ago, enrolled at a seminary in Granby, Mass., spending a year of religious 
preparation there before coming to this friary. 
</P>
<P>
Now, practically all his possessions are shared. The Franciscan notion of 
poverty does not require rags and thin soup; rather, the idea is that total 
dependence on God reduces the need for material wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Pacholec's narrow room contains a single bed, a desk, a small bookshelf with 
writings by St. Francis, a few Christian music cassettes and a miniature 
Amherst College pennant. 
</P>
<P>
Now, his emotional support comes from the group, and from God. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prayers Open Day 
</P>
<P>
His day with the novices begins at 8 with morning prayers. The male voices 
recite the prayers with perfect unanimity, never stumbling, their hands folded 
quietly in their laps. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace be with you," they say, hugging their brothers. "Welcome," they tell the 
stranger in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
After a breakfast of cold cereal, the novices file into class taught by 
Karwacki. A square-jawed New Jersey native, he is frank and down-to-earth, a 
veteran of years as a high school guidance counselor and track coach. 
</P>
<P>
He lectures about making a commitment to the Franciscans, which is not so 
different from marriage. To succeed, both must be freely and knowledgeably 
chosen. Yet ultimately, no one has any idea what commitment will bring down the 
road, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody lives happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
To the Franciscans, chastity means more than merely abstaining from sex. Linked 
with the vow of obedience, it means being willing to sever bonds with friends 
and fellow friars. Often the friars are asked to move to a new assignment, 
sometimes after only a year. 
</P>
<P>
As Pacholec put it, ultimately you end up falling in love with God. "It's hard 
not having it be a physical person," he said, but "that's the relationship 
that's always there." 
</P>
<P>
Midday prayer follows class, and then there is lunch (grayish beef sandwiches) 
and a two-hour work period. While most of the novices help landscape an herb 
garden with radiating paths, Pacholec, in blue jeans, mows the vast lawn. 
</P>
<P>
The complex sits on a 250-acre estate that once belonged to Charles Carroll, a 
wealthy patriot and the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
The stone main building is a scaled-down version of the friary in Assisi, 
Italy, the town where St. Francis spent his life. A dramatic structure of 
arcades, clay roof tiles and a central fountain, it has gorgeous views of the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller building where the novices live dates to 1830, and was renovated by 
last year's novices. Karwacki is a big believer in manual labor, saying it 
diffuses tension. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for Run 
</P>
<P>
After work period, the novices have free time, when Pacholec usually lifts 
weights or goes for a run. Then there is evening prayer, followed by dinner and 
an hour of solitude. 
</P>
<P>
At night, the novices might rent a video or sit in the kitchen and chat over 
chocolate cake. Pacholec goes to sleep about 10:30 or 11, the earliest in his 
life, he says, and he sleeps soundly. 
</P>
<P>
If Pacholec completes the year, he will take simple vows, which entail a 
three-year commitment. That will be followed by years of theology training, the 
taking of solemn vows and ultimately the priesthood. 
</P>

But Karwacki advises the novices not to predict the turns their lives will 
take. "You might find yourself a honey," he says. "You might be a lot happier. 
That might be your calling."

<P>
Even Pacholec says he "can't say beyond a doubt that I'll be a priest in 10 
years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Pacholec feels he has chosen the right path, living, as closely as possible, 
the way Jesus taught his disciples to live. 
</P>
<P>
Is he happy? 
</P>
<P>
Beaming, he replies, "Very."

PROGRESS THREATENS TO DIM LIGHTHOUSE

As the Coast Guard boat skims across Boston Harbor, it draws closer to the 
island lighthouse, one of only five manually operated lights in the United 
States. Salt water sprays off the rocks while sea birds circle around a lobster 
boat a little ways offshore. 
</P>
<P>
For 273 years, lighthouse keepers on Little Brewster Island have used the 
beacon to guide ships safely. But if the Coast Guard's plans are carried out, 
Boston Light, the oldest lighthouse site in the country, will become just like 
450 others, lit by automatic switches instead of by people. Automation would 
save the Coast Guard about $10,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
For Dennis Dever, keeper of the lighthouse, the change will mean a different 
job. "I'll definitely be sad to leave it," he says. "I love the job out there. 
It was sort of a common way of life a couple hundred years ago. Now it's a 
unique way of life." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts is pushing to keep "the crown jewel of 
American lighthouses" in its original, manually operated state. He recently 
petitioned the Senate's Subcommittee on Transportation with his plan. 
</P>
<P>
Senator Kennedy hopes to "buy time for Boston Light" by obtaining the $125,000 
needed to operate it for the next 12 months from the subcommittee and Related 
Agencies, says Kathi Anderson, a legislative aid. 
</P>
<P>
The issue will be taken up in this month in Congress. If Congress votes funds 
to keep Boston Light manned another year, a feasibility study on the light's 
future will begin under the auspices of the Department of Environmental 
Management and Historic Boston Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The issue touches the hearts of many Bostonians. One group that has been 
involved is the Friends of the Boston Harbor Islands Inc. "People come to 
Boston from all over the country to see historic monuments," says Sheila Lynch, 
vice president of the Advocacy Committee for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch has mobilized citizens to write to Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg of New 
Jersey, chairman of the subcommittee on transportation and related agencies, 
which holds the purse strings in the lighthouse debate. 
</P>
<P>
If funds don't come through, and the lighthouse is automated, the Massachusetts 
Department of Environmental Management staff will maintain the grounds. The 
Coast Guard will still be responsible and legally liable for the foghorn and 
the light. 
</P>
<P>
"The best solution," says Lt. John Brooks of the Coast Guard, is to combine 
automation with a caretaker, which could be paid for by a citizens group. Even 
this, however, says Brooks, is disappointing because "it's a page of history 
that's closing, and there's a certain sadness there."

ASK THE JUDGE: ARBITRATION PANEL ASSISTS IN SETTLING FEE DISPUTES

Q. I have been involved in a long and expensive divorce. It was finally 
resolved this year, but it was so traumatic that I truly never want to see the 
inside of the courthouse again. 
</P>
<P>
I just received my attorney's bill, and I am absolutely flabbergasted over the 
amount. I have tried to speak to him about it, but he never returns my calls. I 
don't want to pay the bill since I don't feel it's fair. 
</P>
<P>
Please tell me what I can do. I don't want to be sued, and have to go back to 
court! 
</P>
<P>
J.E., 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A. The Orange County Bar Assn. has a Mandatory Fee Arbitration Committee that 
is made up of qualified attorneys who hear cases involving fee disputes between 
an attorney and the client. 
</P>
<P>
If the amount of the disputed fee is $5,000 or less, a single arbitrator will 
hear the case. In all other cases, a panel of three arbitrators will determine 
the amount of the fee, if any, owed to the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The client or the attorney may disqualify any arbitrator from hearing the case 
if there is a belief that the arbitrator may not be fair. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney and the client have a right to ask the court to hear the fee 
dispute if either one is dissatisfied with the arbitration award. However, the 
arbitration award becomes final if neither party makes such a request within a 
certain period of time. 
</P>
<P>
The committee does charge for its services. For more information about this 
type of hearing, contact the Orange County Bar Assn. for its information 
packet. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I recently got a judgment from small claims court. However, the defendant 
still refuses to pay. Is there anything I can do to get the money owed to me? 
</P>
<P>
M.C., 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
A. There are several ways that you can try to collect on your judgment. One of 
the most commonly used methods is to garnish the wages of your judgment debtor 
so that his employer withholds a portion of his paycheck in order to satisfy 
your judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Another method is to execute on any real or personal property the judgment 
debtor may possess. This method would result in the property being sold in 
order to satisfy your judgment. 
</P>
<P>
You may also place a lien on real and certain personal property of the debtor. 
</P>
<P>
If you do not know what kind of property, if any, the debtor possesses, you may 
require him to appear at a judgment debtor examination and be questioned under 
oath by you. If the debtor refuses to answer, he may be ordered to do so by a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
All of the methods that I have listed assume that the debtor has property of 
some kind. If he does not, you may be out of luck. Contact the Municipal Court 
that heard your small claims case for more information about these methods. 
</P>

FOR SPECIAL DELIVERIES TO CARRIERS, IT'S COD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before a recent trip to the aircraft carrier Independence off the coast of 
Southern California, I thought a cod was a fish or, maybe, a hook-shaped 
peninsula as in Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another kind of COD. It is a small, propeller-driven aircraft that 
delivers supplies and passengers to Navy aircraft carriers. It lands and is 
launched much like the fighters and bombers that operate from the big carrier 
decks. COD, in Navy talk, means Carrier On-board Delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll pick up the COD at North Island Naval Air Station early Friday," Marine 
Maj. Jim McClain said as he outlined the final details on our trip to the 
carrier to do a story on pilots from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll really like this one," a sailor at North Island said, snickering, the 
next day. He pointed to the aircraft, which still had its wings folded. The 
plane was 57 feet long, with an 81-foot wingspan. 
</P>
<P>
Now I was being strapped into my seat in the C-2A. I nervously glanced across 
the aisle at Times photographer Don Kelsen. There were 24 others on the plane, 
including former astronaut Wally Schirra, a VIP who was visiting the carrier. 
Unfamiliar straps crisscrossed my body. And the Navy puts its passenger seats 
facing the rear of the plane because, officials say, tests show this greatly 
improves the chances of survival in case of a crash. The inside of the plane is 
heavily padded, as if trouble is anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Forty minutes after we took off from North Island we landed on the carrier 
deck. A hook on the tail of the plane caught a cable. The stop was about the 
most abrupt I had ever experienced. It was my first landing on an aircraft 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"You think that's bad, wait until you take off," a sailor aboard the ship 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, I was back in the COD about to be catapulted off the deck of the 
Independence. As the plane taxied into position on the starboard side, the crew 
chief was giving final instructions for the launch. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot eased the throttles to full power and the C-2A quivered. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting backward in the plane, the acceleration from the steam catapult took us 
from zero to 135 m.p.h. in two seconds and made me feel as if I should push my 
eyeballs back into my head. When we left the 175-foot-long catapult track, 
there was a moment of what seemed like absolute quiet. I wondered if everything 
was working OK. Then the propellers took hold and we were flying. 
</P>
<P>
Once on the ground, I had to ask Schirra about the launch. Here's a former Navy 
flier who had done his share of "cat shots" from aircraft carriers. He was the 
third American in orbit, and was shot into space as part of the Mercury, Gemini 
and Apollo projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't feel right. I think we should have been sitting forward, not 
backwards," the former astronaut said. "I didn't like it."

Champagne and speeches at the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa on Wednesday 
before a performance of Takigi Noh -- a form of Japan's ancient Noh theater 
enacted outdoors, by firelight (takigi means firewood). The program, presented 
by UC Irvine and the consulate of Japan, was the second stop on a five-city 
American tour for Japan's esteemed Kita Ryu-Noh troupe. The show was staged in 
the Isamu Noguchi-designed "California Scenario" sculpture garden -- a short 
hike for the 150 VIPs gathered at the Center for an hour of trans-Pacific 
networking (an ancient form of the business arts). 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz 
</P>
<P>
Cultural couping. According to the program notes, underwriters were selected 
not just on the basis of financial clout, but also for their ability "to 
improve Japanese-American communications and understanding." Event chairman 
David Eagle elaborated. "The way we did the underwriting side was (designed) to 
show respect for this event," he said. "Noh (theater) is the pinnacle of 
Japanese cultural perfection. It's like having a little slice of the 14th 
Century brought into today. We wanted everything about this program to show 
respect for Kita Ryu-Noh and to be equal in stature to this great cultural 
tradition." Which just so happens -- great cultural tradition-wise -- to be 
making a comeback in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Takigi Noh is helping to repopularize this art form (Noh) among the younger 
generation in Japan," said Cora Mirikitani, recently appointed director of 
performing arts and film for the Japan Society in New York. Mirikitani, who is 
leaving her position at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center in 
Los Angeles to head East, said renewed interest in the fire-lit Noh dramas 
might be due to "something subliminal and alluring about the flames." 
</P>
<P>
The Food 
</P>
<P>
Prawns and crab claws piled under the dripping jaws of an ice sculpture dragon. 
Cheeses and vegetables arrayed beneath an Oriental floral arrangement. Buffet 
selections of beef tenderloin, breast of chicken filets, lobster in puff pastry 
and sui mai (Chinese dumplings). 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
Hiromoto Seki, consul general of Japan. UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason 
and his wife, Suzanne. Three generations of the Sakioka family, owners of 
Sakioka Farms in Costa Mesa: Roy and Tomio Sakioka; their son John and his 
wife, Grace, and grandson George, with his wife, Stephanie. Steve Clemons, 
executive director of the Los Angeles-based Japan America Society of Southern 
California. Performing Arts Center President Thomas Kendrick and his wife, 
Center general manager Judith Morr. Gerald Yoshitomi, executive director of Los 
Angeles' Japanese American Cultural and Community Center. Toeko and Hiroshi 
Sumiyama, president of the Hitachi Chemical Research Center under construction 
at UC Irvine. Hideya and Yasco Gamo, and Joe and Etsuko Price. (Chairman Eagle 
said that without Yasco Gamo's and Etsuko Price's knowledgeable advice on Noh 
traditions, he "wouldn't have dared try to pull this off. We wanted to do it in 
the right spirit -- not just do it," Eagle said.) PAMELA MARIN
