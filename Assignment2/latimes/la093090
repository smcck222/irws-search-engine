Anyone who writes a book called "Teach More -- Faster" will find armies of 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Toilet Train Your Child in One Day" also sold well. The world is full 
of people who want easy answers for life's most complicated problems. 
</P>
<P>
No method can guarantee that all children will learn. Learning is an endlessly 
delicate, subtle, slow, sometimes excruciating process. Hunter understands 
nothing about subtlety. She has capitalized on the marketing mentality that 
threatens to invade schools. After all, this is the age of school vouchers, 
where bonuses are paid to schools whose test scores go up, regardless of how 
such increments were obtained or how long they last.

Time and money have been concentrated on AIDS education, research and treatment 
at the expense of many other incurable diseases. Bleach, hypodermic needles and 
condoms are free for the asking -- yet the numbers of those with the virus are 
escalating. 
</P>
<P>
People do have the privilege of choosing the way they want to live -- but if 
they continually put their lives at risk, do they have the right to increase 
their demands on others who choose not to live by those risks? I think not.

Though production wrapped this summer on "Box Office Bunny," Bugs Bunny fans 
will have to keep waiting for the five-minute cartoon scheduled to coincide 
with Bugs' 50th anniversary. It still has no release date. 
</P>
<P>
"It needs to be attached to the right movie," explains a spokesman for Warner 
Bros. -- meaning a family film. 
</P>
<P>
Likely contenders: one of the studio's holiday pictures, which include the Dan 
Aykroyd-Chevy Chase-John Candy comedy, "Valkenvania," and the animated feature 
"The Nutcracker Prince." 
</P>
<P>
"Box Office Bunny" has the kwazy wabbit going into action when a multiplex 
movie house is built over his hole. Co-starring Elmer Fudd as an usher, and 
Daffy Duck as an irascible duck, with voices by Jeff Bergman, it marks the 
first Bugs short to be released theatrically in 26 years. Or maybe it will be 
27. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another cottontail continues his big screen spree, as work is under 
way at Disney on Roger Rabbit's third cartoon short, "Hare in My Soup." It's 
due next year. Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: FINIS FOR FREDDY?

<P>
The producers of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series, who caught some flak for 
having fun with a character who tortures and murders kids, have decided that 
young Freddy Krueger was himself . . . an abused child. 
</P>
<P>
That's the twist in New Line Cinema's "Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare," now 
being written, which will delve into Freddy's miserable childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're not doing this to excuse Freddy for what he is. We're not saying 
that society turned him into a vicious child killer," says Rachel Talalay, 
who'll make her directorial debut with this, the sixth Freddy installment. 
</P>
<P>
Talalay, who was involved in the first four installments of the "Nightmare on 
Elm Street" series (producing "III" and "IV"), came up with the storyline for 
"VI," which Michael DeLuca is writing. 
</P>
<P>
To be depicted in flashbacks, Freddy's childhood will include abuse by his 
stepfather, as well as the cruelty of classmates. Robert Englund will again 
star as the adult Freddy -- possibly his last appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned," Talalay says, "we will effectively kill Freddy in a 
way that will make it impossible to bring him back (as in the previous 
installments). We've got some real good tricks planned. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take him out with a bang." Pat H. Broeske

Feathers could fly when CBS attempts to follow in the legendary footsteps of 
Alfred Hitchcock with a TV sequel to "The Birds," the director's 1963 thriller 
about a small town besieged by flocks of winged killers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very well aware of what we're taking on," says Charmaine Balian, senior 
vice president of drama development for Universal Television, which is 
producing the TV movie, now in "early" pre-production. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to approach it very thoughtfully so that the movie will stand on 
its own. Obviously, our hats are off to Hitchcock in the process." 
</P>
<P>
"The Birds II" (working title) will feature "a whole new storyline, with new 
characters," Balian adds. "The only continuing characters are the birds." 
</P>
<P>
The plot will have "some relevancy" to environmental concerns, Balian hints, 
explaining that "birds are part of nature, and to some extent our story is 
about the misfiring of nature." Like the original film, which was based on a 
Daphne du Maurier short story, the sequel will emphasize suspense over carnage. 
"This is not a blood and gore picture at all." 
</P>
<P>
No cast and director are set, but Balian hopes to bring back some cast and crew 
members from the original, which starred Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor and Suzanne 
Pleshette. Kyle Counts

George Gallo bases his script on the true story of Frank Pesce, a.k.a. Frank 
the Fish, an actor he met on the set of "Midnight Run." The film, produced by 
David Permut, focuses on Pesce's relationship with his father in a New York 
Italian neighborhood during the '70s. The film also stars Anthony LaPaglia, 
Robert Forester and, yes, Frank Pesce as his own older brother.

ON THE RECORD: STRAVINSKY'S 'PULCINELLA' AND MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Pulcinella' was my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole 
of my late work became possible," Stravinsky wrote in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a backward look, of course -- the first of many love affairs in that 
direction -- but it was a look in the mirror, too." 
</P>
<P>
Stravinsky was talking about his 1920 commedia dell'arte ballet score for 
Diaghilev, based on music ascribed to Giambattista Pergolesi, the short-lived 
Neapolitan (1710-36) whose posthumous reputation was such that he was credited 
with 330 compositions, of which some 300 have since been proven spurious. But 
"Pulcinella" preceded the start of the debunking process by three decades. 
</P>
<P>
The source material is, as it turns out, the work of half a dozen composers, 
including Pergolesi, whose portion is seven of the ballet's 19 numbers, and an 
obscure contemporary of his named Domenico Gallo who provided five, including 
the obsessively catchy tune with which the score opens. 
</P>
<P>
While Stravinsky left the inherited melodies very nearly intact, he infused 
them with the rhythmic dynamism that is uniquely his, while providing the 
delectably dry orchestration for an ensemble of 30-odd players. 
</P>
<P>
The Stravinsky method of working with borrowed materials is set forth in a 
helpful new recording (London 425 614) in which his complete score is followed 
by some engaging source material: trio sonata movements by Gallo (including the 
opening theme) and a cello piece by Pergolesi (London 425 614). 
</P>
<P>
"Pulcinella" is performed by the excellent St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, whose 
efforts, alas, are overshadowed by Christopher Hogwood's humorless, unincisive 
direction. The trio of vocal soloists ranges from smoothly proficient (mezzo 
Bernadette Manca di Nissa) to adequate if hard-pressed (bass John Ostendorf) to 
crude (tenor David Gordon). 
</P>
<P>
The program takes wing, however, with the Baroque sources, snappily projected 
by a small contingent of orchestra principals, led by Hogwood in his element: 
directing 18th-Century repertory from the harpsichord. 
</P>
<P>
A wholly original example of Stravinsky-looking-back -- disdaining, that is, 
the episodic structure, grandioseness and rhythmic fury of "Le Sacre du 
Printemps," with which he had set the world on its ear in 1913 in favor of 
formal order and textural clarity -- rounds out what should have been a 
dynamite program: a punchless reading by Hogwood and his Minnesotans of the 
1938 "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto, a dry-point evocation of the Baroque concerto 
grosso. 
</P>
<P>
There is no source material as a bonus, but conductor Richard Hickox, his 
responsive City of London Sinfonia and a stylish vocal trio -- mezzo Ann 
Murray, tenor Martyn Hill and bass David Thomas -- do present "Pulcinella" with 
all its gleaming wit, charm and rowdiness intact (Virgin Classics 90767). 
</P>
<P>
The added work here, superlatively done by Hickox and his instrumentalists, is 
backward-looking and unmistakably of its time (1942), the tough, acerbic, 
all-Stravinsky "Danses Concertantes." 
</P>
<P>
Note: Virgin's annotator, unaware of half a century's worth of Baroque 
scholarship (and a good deal of Stravinsky scholarship as well) ascribes all of 
the "Pulcinella" sources to Pergolesi. In addition, Virgin supplies neither 
texts nor translations of the vocal segments. 
</P>
<P>
The most rigorously backward-looking -- formally, texturally and rhythmically 
clear -- of the immediate post-"Pulcinella" pieces of the 1920s are the 
not-too-often encountered Concerto for Piano and Winds, the "Capriccio" for the 
same combination and the Symphonies of Wind Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
All three are presented, along with the desert-dry "Movements" (1959) for piano 
and a more usual orchestra of winds and strings, in dynamic, superbly detailed 
readings by pianist Paul Crossley and the London Sinfonietta under Esa-Pekka 
Salonen (Sony Classics 45797). 
</P>
<P>
Stravinsky's 1946 Concerto in D for string orchestra is a far more menacing 
work than one might guess from listening to the slick, sweet-toned performance 
by the Moscow Virtuosi under Vladimir Spivakov (RCA 60370). 
</P>
<P>
The program is, nonetheless, intriguingly unhackneyed, offering in addition to 
the Stravinsky, Prokofiev's delightful "Overture on Hebrew Themes"; the flashy 
"Capriccio" for oboe and strings of Penderecki; Karl Amadeus Hartmann's 
touching 1939 "Concerto funebre," with Spivakov himself as the silky violin 
soloist. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the funny-weird "Suite in Old Style" by the Soviet Union's 
current musical bad-boy in residence, Alfred Schnittke, which starts off as 
fake (mock?) Handel with "wrong" notes in the bass and leads us into 
alternating sprightly and pensive tunes that have a way either of not finishing 
or taking us down false paths, in the spirit of Mozart's "Musical Joke."

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: THOMSON: REMEMBERING AN ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sotheby's in New York City has announced the sale of items from the estate of 
Virgil Thomson. When the late American composer and critic died at age 92 in 
October of last year, he left his famous apartment at the Chelsea Hotel in 
Manhattan filled with furniture, paintings and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of several works by Florine Stettheimer, Marcel Duchamp and 
Jean Arp (to be sold by the auction house at sales Wednesday and Nov. 14 and 
29), most of the collection will be on sale at Sotheby's on Oct. 11. The 
composer's manuscripts have been left to Yale University; a few published 
scores -- by Thomson and others -- are among the items to be auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 150 lots in the sale are drawings and books, and photographs by, 
among others, Man Ray, Editta Sherman, Berenice Abbott, Maurice Grosser, Roddy 
McDowall, Lee Miller and Betty Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
And there is furniture, including the bed in which much of Thomson's music is 
said to have been written; the dining table at which the composer entertained 
Copland, Cage, Stravinsky and Duchamp, and the kidney-shaped pie-crust table 
that Alice B. Toklas left Thomson in her will. 
</P>
<P>
Among the miscellaneous items: a black silk brocade vest, made for and worn by 
Gertrude Stein; 43 volumes of works by Stein, and Thomson's address book, 
dating from the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
In the introduction to the catalogue, Thomson's friend, the poet and playwright 
Jack Larson, describes the composer in old age: 
</P>
<P>
"The older I saw him become, the more I saw him as the small boy he must have 
been in Kansas City, Missouri -- smart and intuitive, attention-getting and 
accomplished, spiritual but sensual, loving, generous yet sometimes selfish, 
talkative but observant and looking exactly like Virgil had since he was a 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the sale of property from the estate will benefit the Virgil 
Thomson Foundation, Ltd. The property will be on exhibition at Sotheby's from 
Saturday through Oct. 10. Information: (212) 606-7000. 
</P>
<P>
AND COPLAND: The 90th birthday of Thomson's contemporary and friend, Aaron 
Copland, will not go unnoticed hereabouts. The School of Music at USC will hold 
a monthlong Copland celebration, incorporating six programs in nine 
performances, Nov. 7-Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
These programs will survey the composer's varied output. Copland's opera, "The 
Tender Land," will be performed by USC Opera, Dec. 6-9, closing the 
celebration. His Third Symphony will be given by the USC Symphony, Daniel Lewis 
conducting, Nov. 16; chamber music and songs are featured in a Copland faculty 
recital, Nov. 18; Michele Zukovsky, a principal of the L.A. Philharmonic, will 
play the Clarinet Concerto with the USC Chamber Orchestra, Nov. 13, eve of the 
composer's actual 90th birthday -- he was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Nov. 14, 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
Among the performers at these programs: Conductors Larry Rachleff, Daniel 
Lewis, Donald Crockett and Douglas Lowry; violinist Eudice Shapiro, and soprano 
Janice McVeigh. 
</P>
<P>
Funding these programs is a $36,000 grant from the E. Nakamichi Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
BRIEFLY: Western Opera Theater embarks today on the first leg of its 1990-91 
national tour. Between today and Nov. 11, the San Francisco Opera-affiliated 
touring company will visit communities in 13 states, from California to New 
Jersey, from Oregon to Massachusetts to Florida. Donizetti's "Lucia di 
Lammermoor," in its first WOT staging -- directed by Albert Takazauckas and 
conducted by Carol I. Crawford -- is the opera of choice this season. The 
California segment of the tour is funded by a major grant of $50,000 from 
Pacific Telesis Foundation. During the California segment of the winter tour, 
Jan. 22-Feb. 3, the company will perform in Bakersfield, Claremont, Hayward, 
Irvine and San Bernardino. . . . The Monday Evening Concert season begins Oct. 
1 with a performance by the touring Grupo Encuentros de Musica Contemporanea de 
Buenos Aires, conducted by artistic director Alicia Terzian. . . . "High 
Fidelity," Allan Miller's film about the Guarneri String Quartet, will play a 
limited engagement at the Laemmle's Monica Theater in Santa Monica, Nov. 
21-Dec. 6. . . . The Boston Symphony's 1990 summer season at Tanglewood broke 
its own attendance record; the new record is 311,533, up from the 1989 figure 
of 311,501.

ON THE OFF BEAT: A PLEASANT, SOULFUL SURPRISE FROM HOLMES BROTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never fails. Every time you think there can't possibly be any surprises left in 
American roots music, something surfaces that isn't 12-bar business as usual. 
New artists like the Holmes Brothers pop up with a fresh set of influences or 
an obscure recording by an underrecognized singer like O. V. Wright is 
re-issued. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant surprises are the focus of this American edition of "On the Offbeat," 
a periodic review of roots, ethnic and non-mainstream pop music from around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 The Holmes Brothers, "In The Spirit," Rounder. This New York quintet, 
anchored by transplanted Virginians Wendell and Sherman Holmes and Popsy Dixon, 
isn't a blues band per se -- the sound covers the R&amp;B front from the 
mid-'50s up to the late '60s Stax soul era. The most distinctive of its debut 
album: a vocals-oriented approach from the gospel church, drummer Dixon's 
falsetto cries. 
</P>
<P>
The arrestingly rough, soulful singing helps the Holmes Brothers weather 
occasional lapses in the arrangements and breathes some life into a couple of 
too familiar blues/soul standards. Even though the musical components are 
hardly new, there's a refreshing absence of formula on "In The Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
O.V. Wright, "Live," Hi/Demon import. Wright was the gospel shouter counterpart 
to Al Green's smooth slickster during the latter's mid-'70s salad days on 
Memphis' Hi Records. Wright never became popular outside the R&amp;B market . . 
. and Japan, judging from the crowd response to this live album recorded at two 
Tokyo concerts in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction isn't too surprising considering the dynamic opening salvo of some 
of Wright's best songs -- "Blind, Crippled and Crazy," the exceptional "Eight 
Men and Four Women," and "Precious, Precious" -- and the rough-edged, 
passionate support of the Hi rhythm section that backed Green on all his hits. 
The rest is merely a history lesson of gospel-rooted Southern soul delivered by 
a great singer (who died of cancer the following year) and a band that isn't 
just going through the motions. You need more? 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 Buckwheat Zydeco, "Where There's Smoke, There's Fire," Island. Buckwheat 
Zydeco may be too versatile for his own good. His previous Island albums 
suffered from a patchwork eclecticism that prevented potent individual tracks 
from adding up to a cohesive whole. "Where There's Smoke, There's Fire," 
produced by Los Lobos' David Hidalgo, falls victim to the same malaise. 
</P>
<P>
The most inspired selection -- and biggest missed opportunity -- is the Stones' 
"Beast of Burden." The first two minutes are so soulful that a Top 40 hit for 
Buckwheat Zydeco is actually conceivable . . . until the arrangement falters 
badly and the song sadly just peters out. 
</P>
<P>
Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic).

'HARD WAY' CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Kari Granville's Sept. 2 article on our movie "The Hard Way": 
</P>
<P>
Like many films, "The Hard Way" has followed a long, serpentine course to the 
screen. It was originally going to be directed by Arthur Hiller, and Ted Danson 
was set to star. 
</P>
<P>
When John Badham and I came aboard, our first attempt was to team Kevin Kline 
and Gene Hackman, with Chicago as the location, only to eventually arrive at 
Michael J. Fox and James Woods and New York when all but the shouting was over. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the writers, the history was no less complicated. The original 
script was written by Lem Dobbs and then rewritten by Daniel Pyne. Both scripts 
were supervised by producer Bill Sackheim. It was the Pyne draft that got 
Badham, myself, Fox and Woods to commit. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Dan's obligation to his John Schlesinger picture, "Pacific Heights," 
also produced by Sackheim, he was not available to do the final polish. Badham 
and I brought in Jeff Reno and Ron Osborne of "Moonlighting" fame, who ran the 
final leg of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Final credit is still being arbitrated by the Writers Guild of America. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure The Times didn't have enough column inches to explain all this. 
</P>
<P>
A movie grows and changes like a Ouija board prodded by a thousand hands: It's 
half talent, half voodoo -- but John and I would not have been able to do the 
work we did without the fine foundation laid by Dobbs, Sackheim and Pyne, and 
we wanted to set that record straight.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOBSTERS AND MAGNATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Writing on gangster films in the Sept. 23 issue, both Patrick Goldstein and 
Peter Rainer attempt to establish a link between gangsterism and free 
enterprise. They make this appalling comparison by conveniently blanking out 
the meaning of the word free. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalism involves the voluntary exchange of goods between people. Any form of 
coercion -- by government or individual -- is the negation of free enterprise. 
The gangster's stock in trade is coercion at its most brutal. 
</P>
<P>
Al Capone told speak-easy owners to either buy his beer or have their kneecaps 
busted and their barrooms blown to pieces. This was hardly a voluntary exchange 
of goods. And when Vito Corleone puts a loaded gun to somebody's head and makes 
him "an offer he can't refuse," he's not acting as an apostle of Adam Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The next time Rainer and Goldstein ask for a raise, Times management should 
take a negotiating tip from the Godfather and place a severed horse head in 
their beds. Maybe then they'll appreciate the difference between gangsterism 
and the free market.

A VICTIM OF POLITICS -- OR OF BAD ART? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is a crisis, but one of public policy and politics -- not of art," writes 
Allan Parachini, immediately distorting the issues at stake at the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center ("At LATC, Not All the Drama Is Onstage," Sept. 16). 
</P>
<P>
As a displaced Chicagoan who stopped attending the center some months ago not 
because of the dangers of downtown L.A. but because of the garbage on the 
stages, let me assure you the LATC problem is fundamentally artistic. 
</P>
<P>
It is rousing to have a "cause" -- like saving a threatened theater, but not 
all theaters deserve saving and not all closures are unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
The theater's attempt to pass itself off as a cutting-edge, avant-garde outlet 
for "dangerous" work is pure hype. Its revivals are stodgy, its new work 
pathetic and its multi-ethnic policy designed to attract political rather than 
artistic converts. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic director Bill Bushnell has had plenty of time to prove himself in Los 
Angeles. All he has demonstrated is ineptitude. It is high time genuine theater 
artists rather than pseudo-rebels and phony iconoclasts got down to the 
business of creating real theater in this town.

THE HISPANIC/LATINO DEBATE: THE LANGUAGE IS STILL SEARCHING FOR A TERM THAT 
SATISFIES EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The word Latino in Spanish means Latin. Latins were a people who lived on the 
outskirts of Rome in ancient times. 
</P>
<P>
They eventually came to dominate Rome and as a result spread their language and 
culture throughout the empire. This is why a Latino is a Spaniard, a 
Portuguese, an Italian, a French person, a Romanian and, if you wish, a Latin 
American. 
</P>
<P>
How does the word Latino say you have Indian blood or black blood in you? It 
denies it as much as the word Hispanic does! 
</P>
<P>
As for myself, you can classify me as a Mexican, or Chicano, but call me a 
Latino only if you are referring to all Latins.

A VICTIM OF POLITICS -- OR OF BAD ART? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I appreciated both Parachini's and Sylvie Drake's articles. I'd like to add 
another aspect of the LATC, surprisingly overlooked by both writers. 
</P>
<P>
That is LATC's Theatre as a Learning Tool, which in five years has brought 
50,000 students from high schools all over Los Angeles County to see Theatre 
Center productions during school time. 
</P>
<P>
Theatre as a Learning Tool provides study guides and seminars to teachers prior 
to the plays, helping teachers integrate theater and literature with their 
language arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
It is an invaluable experience for Los Angeles teachers and students and is 
another reason why LATC should be preserved.

BEYOND 9-TO-5 IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
HEY, FORGET THE MYTH THAT THIS CITY IS LAID BACK. WHEN IT COMES TO HARD WORK, 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF STORIES TO BE TOLD. . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Working hard? Putting in longer hours at the grindstone? Feeling stressed and 
out of sync in the city where people are said not to exert themselves except 
when they're playing Frisbee? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you're not alone. That 50- to 60-hour work week is something many 
Angelenos call normal -- because of economic necessity or career choice. 
Indeed, in the real L.A., most people do work hard, although some Angelenos 
speculate that they may work at a different -- more relaxed -- pace than their 
fellow citizens across the country, especially those on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Two transplanted Easterners, public relations executive Tom Reed and urban 
planner Bessie Kong, find some truth to the "laid-back Los Angeles" myth. Reed 
observes that "New York is busier," the pace more frenetic. He believes that 
hyper state means people are working harder, but is willing to concede that 
some of the hustle may be more style than substance, and adds: "Maybe there are 
just not as many Type A people out here." Kong thinks more people here work for 
themselves and can set their own pace. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics tend to support part of Kong's observation: It seems that more 
people are self-employed here than in other parts of the country. The U.S. 
Census Bureau reported in 1988 that the number of businesses in California 
increased by more than one-third from 1982 to 1987, compared with a 28% rise 
nationally. And the state's Employment Development Department reported that the 
largest percentage growth in business during the 1980s was a 51% rise in small 
new businesses with three or fewer employees. 
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas Cummings, a professor of management and organization at USC 
who came here from Cleveland in 1976, "The sheer cost of living out here has 
got people working hard." That, he said, and the global competition that hit 
the West Coast earlier and harder than some other areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"You go back to some dinky place back East, and you won't find that," Cummings 
said of L.A.'s economic reality. "In terms of the work ethic, probably people 
are no different. But it's an entirely different world here." 
</P>
<P>
People on the East Coast may not agree with Cummings. After all, they have been 
saying bad things about Los Angeles ever since the city was invented, and it 
does not take a congressionally funded investigation to know that the source of 
the Lotusland myth is not on the West Coast. But many people here seem to have 
bought into the myth and believe there must be something wrong with them 
because they are working so hard. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than myth, Angelenos might try reality: In 1988 pollster Louis Harris 
released the results of his company's survey of the national work week, and 
found it had increased from 40.6 hours in 1973 to 46.8 in 1987, and was headed 
nowhere but up in the future. But that is not all the researchers found. Broken 
down regionally, the hours were 45.6 a week for the East, 47.2 for the Midwest, 
47.1 for the South and 47.3 for the West. We won, in other words, although it 
is not clear what the prizes in this contest are. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a look at some Angelenos who are hard at work, who are driven 
by any number of needs, who are in the contest regardless of the prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Public relations is a business that attracts and fully satisfies terrible 
workaholics, which I am, but I don't do it quite as much as I used to," Tom 
Reed said. "It's a trap. There's just no end to what you can do." 
</P>
<P>
In public relations for the last 20 years, Reed is a senior vice president at 
Braun Ketchum in the Mid-Wilshire area. He is responsible for "investor 
relations," which he described as a sub-category of public relations, in which 
a client is represented to the investment community. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, he said, he has cut back to about 10 hours a day from 
12, "including the reading I do at home, the telephone calls at home, 
everything. Before I could stay up, write a speech all night and kill myself, 
get away with two hours' sleep, and be ready to go the next day. I can't do it 
now. It makes me feel too beat up." 
</P>
<P>
Although he usually rises at 5:30 a.m. to monitor the stock market, he does not 
count that as "work time"; it is, rather, a "kind of hobby." He gets to the 
office "not terribly early, around 8:30 or 9," he said, "and tends to stay 
later. And I take work home." 
</P>
<P>
Reed is not in public relations for the money, and he laughed at the question: 
"There was a time in the beginning when money was very important. Public 
relations is not a business you get rich in. There are good salaries, but it's 
not like corporate law where your earnings are in direct proportion to how many 
hours you work." 
</P>
<P>
He came to Los Angeles from New York 10 years ago, expecting that his industry 
would be more laid back here. But people were every bit as busy -- as they were 
in many other professions. 
</P>
<P>
Reed retained his New York work habits -- staying at work until 10 or 11 p.m. 
-- until about five years ago. Now he rarely works that late. On the day he was 
interviewed, for example, his 59th birthday, he said he would not be working 
late at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of wish it wasn't my birthday," he said, "I've got a lot to do." 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the pace of his own voice, and what he was saying, Tom Mosley halted 
for a moment and said, "This is awful. I sound like a runaway train. But I'm 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not runaway, but a high-speed locomotive nonetheless. Mosley has been 
program manager for the Hollywood-based AIDS Project Los Angeles hot line for 
five years and as of this week will be heading the APLA department that 
develops materials -- videos, brochures -- for minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
He has been supervising the 135 volunteers who staff the hot line, keeping up 
with the literature on AIDS, doing most of his own clerical work, giving 
training and refresher courses. Being one of the few blacks on the staff adds 
to his workload, he said. "They wave me around like a black flag. But it's 
good, because there are so few minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley, who lives in West Hollywood, hates reading all the medical journals, he 
said, but the hot line's "greatest pressure" is the need to know everything. 
"Most of those calls are motivated by fear. They have to have the answer right 
now. You can't relax." 
</P>
<P>
He gets Tuesdays and Sundays off, "never two days in a row," is compulsive 
about the gym, putting in two hours, six mornings a week. He works from about 
11 a.m. to 8 or 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all compulsive here," Mosley said of the 110 APLA staff members. "Being 
around all this death and dying is not the healthiest thing you can do. In 
order to survive this, you have to be compulsive." 
</P>
<P>
He sounds just as compulsive about shutting it off: "Anything I can do to get 
my mind off stuff. I live under headphones. At the gym, at home. I put them on 
and shut myself in my room at home and my roommate knows not to come near me. I 
play as hard as I work, and I would not go to Palm Springs and lay in the sun. 
My idea of relaxation is not to lay back. I've got to be committed to something 
-- a project, a part, a nightclub where I can go dance all night." As an "AIDS 
guru," he said, what he cannot shut off, even at the parties, is "someone 
getting in my face and asking about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley has learned to cry, and calls it a good release from all the stress. 
However, he said he is unable to grieve or mourn. He blocks the emotion he 
feels when he hears a friend has died of AIDS, and then finds himself weeping 
over an AT&amp;T "Reach Out and Touch Someone" commercial. 
</P>
<P>
He was a professional dancer in Las Vegas -- working similar hours and at the 
same pace -- when a skiing accident put an end to that career. That, and the 
loss of a friend to "gay cancer" in the early days of AIDS, brought him to his 
present work six years ago. "There was a new urgency, a need for values . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Having been tested three times for the HIV virus and coming up negative drives 
him even more. He calls it survivors' guilt. 
</P>
<P>
He would be turning 40 in a few days, he said, and planned "to party till I 
drop." 
</P>
<P>
For now he is where he wants to be, as a black, as a gay man, and as Tom 
Mosley. "It feeds my ego. It's all about applause, not money." 
</P>
<P>
He was just as driven as a dancer, he admits, and wonders how much of his 
compulsion is related to the stress of working in a world of death and dying. 
Dancing and work at APLA demand the same high energy, and are equally as 
dynamic he said. "I don't know where I'd go if not this. I can't go through 
life being slowed up. Air traffic control? Broadcast news? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
As an independent painter, Richard Urquidez is not working as hard as he used 
to, when his jobs came through the Painters and Drywallers Union. He worked 
about a 40-hour week with the union, "plus an extra 16 hours a week on side 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
His hours are about the same now. He has not had a weekend off since he went on 
his own six months ago. The money is about the same, but he says he is not 
working as hard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's slower paced. I can pick my jobs. I won't take a job that's going to kill 
me." Often, with factory and construction work, he said, "you spray toxic 
stuff. You're supposed to wear a respirator, but even if you never take it off, 
it takes an hour to come down from the high. You're higher than a kite. Some 
guys hallucinate. You get red eyes. If you wore the goggles you'd be taking 
them off every two minutes to wipe the overspray off. You come home, and two or 
three hours later, you're still spitting out these paint balls. This is not as 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
By working smaller jobs, rather than at large industrial projects, Urquidez 
said, he can avoid the worst aspects of painting. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidez talked about his work while taking a break from a house painting job 
in Bel Air. He estimated he puts in a 60-hour week, "20% of it running around 
giving estimates, getting supplies, matching colors." Several months out of the 
year, he averages closer to 75 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind working these hours. Once you're used to it, it's nothing." He 
often has to cancel weekend plans, like going to the L.A. County Fair recently, 
to do a job. That's OK. 
</P>
<P>
And when he's not working? "If I'm not sleeping, I'm doing yard work at my 
mom's or watching the games." 
</P>
<P>
Urquidez, 32, is a fifth-generation Angeleno who lives in Montebello and has 
been working as a painter ever since his uncles gave him summer jobs with their 
paint business during junior high. He's been at it full time since age 19 when 
he left junior college. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the care and pride he obviously puts into his work, if he had it to do 
over again, he said, "Oh no way I'd be in this business. I wish I would have 
been a carpenter. I wouldn't advise anyone to be a painter. But if it's your 
training, it's your livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to other parts of the country, he said of Los Angeles: "You have to 
work harder out here. There's so many people. Competition is bringing the price 
down. These guys who come in, put up one thick coat, sometimes they buy cheap 
paint for $4 a gallon and put it in brand-name cans. To do the job the way I 
want, I'd cost a little more but it takes a lot of time to prep up the house. 
You don't just pay for what I do, but what I know." 
</P>
<P>
He attributes much of the competition to immigrant businesses with newcomers 
underbidding people like himself. 
</P>
<P>
He sounds resigned to being a painter, unconcerned about the hours, but 
restless with the overall scheme of things: "Compared to other jobs, people in 
office jobs, executives, I can't see how the pay scale figures -- why this guy 
is worth $150,000-to-$200,000 a year, when the best possible year I could have 
is $50,000? I'm working just as hard." 
</P>
<P>
Bessie Kong is an urban planner. Earlier this year she left the consulting 
firm, in civil and land use planning, where she had worked for seven years and 
went on her own. The future was beginning to look stagnant to her, and besides, 
she and her husband wanted a family. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted more free time. I wanted to be in control of my hours." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hong Kong, she came to New York with her family when she was 4, was 
educated on the East Coast and had most of her work experience in East Coast 
cities. She arrived in Los Angeles with her husband in 1982 well aware of the 
laid-back myth. Now she sees the myth as a matter of pace rather than hours or 
amount of work. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of difference having to work 9 to 5 or running your own 
company. The stresses are less even though you work longer hours." 
</P>
<P>
Her hours are longer than when she worked for a firm: "The day does tend to 
stretch out, but you can choose your own free time. It makes it seem like more 
free time." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Kong said, she gets to her office, on Olympic Boulevard in Los 
Angeles, around 9:30 a.m. and stays until "8, 9 or 10. Sometimes I can leave at 
5:30 or 6," which she terms a light day. 
</P>
<P>
It's a 10- to 12-hour day Kong describes, but she does not wish she was working 
fewer hours. She attributes her long days to L.A.'s size and traffic, which 
make it more difficult to schedule appointments in the field, and to the fact 
her husband puts in similar hours. 
</P>
<P>
Being independent has its own pressures, she said, and worrying where the next 
contract is coming from is one of them. Nor is it as easy to take a vacation, 
she said, adding that she found herself making a lot of long-distance phone 
calls when she and her husband did get away for a week this summer. 
</P>
<P>
She has chosen not to set up an office at her home in Silver Lake, does not 
take work home and tries to avoid coming in weekends by working later during 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
Now in her late 30s, she is happy with her current situation, Kong said, but 
knows that if, for example, she got more involved in the community, something 
would have to give. She would have to cut back. And while she knows a baby 
would be an enormous change and "another large structure of time constraints," 
she is not concerned. "Being on my own still gives me flexibility. I can bring 
the baby here." 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Moore probably puts 10 or 11 hours into the average work day, but who's 
counting? 
</P>
<P>
Vice president and manager of the Los Angeles branch (the downtown or corporate 
branch) of Home Savings for the last five years, she likes what she does, and 
said, "The job and what I enjoy doing are a perfect match. I hope it brings out 
the best in me. . . . I would imagine if one didn't like it, one would spend a 
lot of time knowing what the hours were. But, I can't turn on a clock and say 
this is how many hours I spend." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago, Moore started out as a part-time teller at Home Savings. Her 
children were graduating from high school. She had totally immersed herself in 
the world of volunteer services and was looking for something to fill in the 
middle of the day. She found it. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of three grown children and grandmother of one, all in the Southern 
California area, Moore, now divorced, talked about her job at her office, 
seated before a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce poster of oranges, palm trees 
and the downtown skyline. She could have been an extension of the poster, 
talking as she did about being part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
She moved downtown to the Bunker Hill area three years ago from Arcadia, 
explaining, "I wanted to become involved in the community in which I worked. In 
doing so I became a part of L.A. My job and being in downtown Los Angeles are 
one and the same." 
</P>
<P>
There is a public relations aspect to her job, building contacts with the 
business community, and Moore belongs to the downtown Rotary Club of Los 
Angeles and serves on several of its committees, is on the advisory board of 
the Sheriff Department's drug abuse program, SANE, and has just finished a term 
as chairwoman of a corporate support group for the Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Her days often start with a breakfast meeting. If not, she is in the office by 
7:30 or 8 a.m., having avoided a commuting tantrum by walking to work. She 
tends to go out for lunch, "usually business related," and averages two 
business-related dinners per week, hibernating on the other nights at home and 
not eating. 
</P>
<P>
Usually Moore leaves the office around 6 p.m., but if there are memos or 
speeches to write or budgets to work out, she has no problem staying until 10 
p.m. or bringing work home. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she completed a six-month weekend-and-evening "mini-MBA" course at 
USC, getting a certificate in management effectiveness, paid for by Home 
Savings. Now she is taking a 14-credit class on Tuesday nights, part of Beverly 
Hills High School's adult education program, in "other financial vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
She does not consider herself a workaholic, she said, defining those people as 
ones who cannot stop. She can. She plays golf one day a week, will take time 
off to travel, and said, "I do not feel restricted. Maybe it's because of where 
I am in my life at this point in time," a point she "would just as soon" not 
specify in numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm responsible for me. I love my family, visit them, but the decisions I make 
regarding time only affect me." 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Miller is involved in a classic hard-work situation. She is director of 
catering for a new restaurant, Lunaria, just down the road from Century City on 
Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Lunaria, a French bistro started by Bernard Jacoby, formerly of the Biltmore's 
Bernard's, opened its doors in July. Miller came on board in February, and got 
on the phone, targeting businesses, setting up appointments with meeting 
planners, soliciting private parties -- "small business meetings, fund-raisers, 
birthdays, special events, anywhere from 10 to 130 people." 
</P>
<P>
She is still on the phone and knocking on doors she said, and it makes for a 
busy day. She works, she said, "on an average of 10 to 16 hours a day, 
depending on whether or not there's a function. I run the event, doing 
everything it takes to make it run smoothly, from the initial contact to the 
bill and thank-you letter. If it's an evening event, I'm still here all day." 
And, she added later, she is still there afterwards, "through the cleanup 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
Those are her average hours for a six-day week, she said. The restaurant is 
closed Mondays, but she works then, taking Sundays off instead. 
</P>
<P>
Even for someone as young as 24, that's an exhausting schedule, but she is not 
complaining and not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
She has been in the business for five years, first at the Biltmore, then the 
Meridian Hotel in Long Beach, both times working with Jacoby. And while those 
more established situations allowed for a more normal work schedule, they also 
prepared her for what was ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it. I've chosen this as a career. In the hospitality industry if you 
accept a position like this and take on the responsibility, you know you're 
going to do more than your hours (technically a 40-hour week), and you don't 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she said, most of her friends in her age group are working just as 
hard. Many of them are in the hotel and restaurant industry, and in general, 
she said, "the 9-to-5 people that I know are getting rarer and rarer." She has 
a boyfriend, an understanding one, she said, who is in sales and works similar 
hours. She does not feel she is missing out. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean her schedule does not take its toll. Take her social life 
for example. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget over a week in advance. Everything's contingent. It's always, 'Fine, if 
I don't have a banquet, I'll do it.' And, while she lives a few doors from the 
beach in Venice, she sighed, she does not take an early morning run or swim. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep saying I will, but I just value sleep so much I can never do it." 
</P>
<P>
It is not economics that has propelled her to take on such a demanding job, she 
said, but ambition, love of the type of work, and an ingrained-from-birth 
belief in the work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an extremely high paying industry, but I was raised with the 
belief that in the long run, work is worth it, the sense of self-esteem, the 
personal reward is worth it, if you love your job, which I do. Here, sending 
somebody off who's given a party -- they've put their trust in you -- the 
reward you get when they leave happy, it's great." 
</P>
<P>
It is not the only reward she wants. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get married, do the whole baby thing, have a family and not work for 
while. But only people who are very fortunate get to do that. Especially in 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
She did not even mention owning a house someday. 
</P>
<P>
"That would probably be pushing it," she smiled. "Maybe if I work hard enough, 
I'll be able to get it." 
</P>

'HEAVY-DUTY ANGER' HEATS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ladies, wake up and give us a break. 
</P>
<P>
I was ready to shed a tear for you, but I was too busy washing the bathroom 
floors and cleaning the toilet bowls. 
</P>
<P>
I don't do windows, but I vacuum the house. 
</P>
<P>
To clear the air, some of us men do quite more than the few chores listed in 
the article. 
</P>
<P>
So my question is, what's the big deal? If you want more done around the house, 
ask nicely. You'll be surprised.

'HEAVY-DUTY ANGER' HEATS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In discussing women's "Heavy-Duty Anger" (Sept. 23), Bettijane Levine and some 
of the women interviewed assume equality of commitment by men and women to 
certain goals. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that many women want a package that includes first, security, 
marriage and fidelity; children; frequent intimate conversation, and a home 
(with nice things in it that are kept clean). 
</P>
<P>
Far fewer men want that exact package -- or they want it to a lesser degree. 
Thus, if women are insistent that men live up to the whole deal plus an exact 
sharing in the maintenance of it, many of us will opt out. For me (and 
increasingly more men -- and some women) life goes on quite nicely alone and 
without any of the four items above. A woman who wants more, has got to pay 
more in time, caring and work.

EXTRAORDINARY LOOK AT NON-ORDINARY TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I picked up the View section on Sept. 18 and glanced at your cover story, 
"A Step Toward the Light," I thought I was in for another cynical portrayal of 
the paranormal by a jaded reporter. I was mistaken. Beth Ann Krier's look at 
pediatrician Melvin Morse's studies of children's near-death experiences was an 
objective piece. Krier's article presented the non-ordinary in a manner that 
was neither critical nor trivial. 
</P>
<P>
If only the medical community could be as nonjudgmental as Krier. What I found 
so acutely ironic was Morse's admission that although 23 out of 25 of the 
children he studied who had had near-death experiences reported to have 
encountered a "presence of light," Morse knew that his scientifically conducted 
study would be rejected for publication in a professional journal, should he 
include this significant finding. Morse had used the scientific model to 
conduct his studies, he had made a statistically significant finding using that 
model, and yet he knew that the scientific paradigm would not accept such a 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
What was equally ironic was Morse's concluding remark that, "As doctors, we 
don't know what to do with this kind of information . . . I'll include myself 
in this. Even now, people say to me, 'Well, doesn't this make you believe in 
life after death?' I guess it just goes against my training so much that I have 
to say, 'Well, I really don't know.' We're not comfortable with death." 
</P>
<P>
Here is a man who has the weight of his own empirical data on his side, yet 
feels compelled to reject the conclusions that data strongly suggest because 
the edifice of a purely material world devoid of anything outside the 
scientific purview would crumble should he make such an admission. As many 
philosophers of science have predicted, the scientific paradigm will itself 
fall under its own rigidity.

FOR 'BOSSY BESSIE' HER HOME LIFE IS A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN DE WOLFE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian-born Bessie Schneider spoke of earlier days. Of how she came to America 
as a little girl and watched her mother sell mattress covers on the streets of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
She reminisced about hectic years spent running Bessie's Bargain Store. "I 
worked hard all my life. I was never rich but I was always happy," Schneider 
said. "I raised three wonderful children, lost two good husbands and now I'm on 
my own. I make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
At 81, Bessie Schneider believes she's found the ideal housing situation for an 
older person who can still manage for herself. 
</P>
<P>
She lives in a housing cooperative that could be described as a cross between a 
congregate-care facility and board and care. 
</P>
<P>
"But it isn't really a care facility because no one takes care of us but 
ourselves and one another," the sprightly woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider is one of 14 renters at Rothman House in West Hollywood, a residence 
for seniors operated under the auspices of the nonprofit Alternative Living for 
the Aging. 
</P>
<P>
"We do pretty much as we please, within reason, of course," she said. "We have 
our own doctors, phone and TV. We pay $455 a month, and that covers utilities, 
upkeep and the evening meal. In addition, we have a gardener, a janitor, a cook 
and a social worker who is available for individual needs." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider moved to Rothman House in 1985, shortly after the facility opened. 
"There are not very many places like this around. And we wouldn't have it it 
weren't for Janet Witkin, the director of ALA, who made it all possible." 
</P>
<P>
Rothman House has two separate wings, each with seven bedrooms and individual 
baths, a common lounge and kitchen. In the evening, residents from both wings 
gather in a large dining area for the only meal of the day prepared by the 
house cook. 
</P>
<P>
"We live like a family and we have a say in how the place is run," Schneider 
said. "All residents attend a weekly meeting where we voice our complaints and 
make suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
Who runs the meetings, a visitor asked. "Bossy Bessie," she replied, with a 
laugh. "I'm the president of the joint." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider has a weekly appointment at the beauty parlor and when she's not busy 
helping solve house-related matters, she shops or spends time on the patio 
knitting and reading. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in some pain most of the time from my arthritic condition, so I don't get 
around as much as I'd like to," she said. But the handicap did not deter 
Schneider from hopping the plane to Aptos (in Northern California) recently to 
visit with one of her daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider believes she has finally tamed her restless nature. "But I'm still 
learning to be patient. It's something all older people must learn to do," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have to be doing something. It's the way I am. All my life, if I was 
baking one pie, I'd bake two. There was always a friend or a neighbor who could 
use one. Here we also do a lot of sharing. 
</P>
<P>
"Each resident has a designated space in the refrigerator and a shelf in the 
pantry. We fix our own breakfast and lunch and everyone is generous with 
sharing what they make. Any time you need something, someone is here to help," 
said Schneider, stopping by the kitchen stove to add some dill to the chicken 
soup she had started preparing earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We also take turns with cleaning up in the kitchen, but if someone isn't 
feeling so good, the others pitch in," she said. "We all look in on Florence 
who hasn't been feeling too well lately. We bring her a cup of tea or soup and 
see that she's comfortable. We watch over one another and that's a good 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider greeted new tenant Harvey Goodman and thanked him for changing the 
light bulb in the kitchen, then stopped to introduce her next-door neighbor, 
Cele Schulman, 85, who was waiting to be picked up by a relative. 
</P>
<P>
Schulman came to live at Rothman house three years ago. "My daughter built a 
nice house for me but I felt so lonesome. I don't like crowds of people, so I 
didn't see myself in one of those large retirement homes. This arrangement is 
perfect for me. It's like being home with people who understand how we feel," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Living with the children never works," Schneider commented. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a daughter up north, another who is an artist and a son who is an 
investigator. They are all busy with their own lives and have their own 
problems. Some older people can make their children miserable with their 
demands." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, who has been a widow for 6 1/2 years, admits that even a place like 
Rothman House takes getting used to. "Older people are set in their ways. They 
want things the way they had it many years ago. But you can't look back. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people who live here come to realize how lucky they are. We are 
never alone."

TIMES 'REMODELS' ITS SOUTHLAND HOME PRICE GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're remodeling around here -- who isn't these days? -- and we want to tell 
you about some major improvements you'll find, starting today, in our Southland 
Home Prices feature. 
</P>
<P>
First, we're now reporting separate sales prices for single-family houses and 
condominiums. Previously, the prices for both had been combined in a single 
figure. Now you'll be able to track price changes and sales activity in both 
houses and condos in your community. 
</P>
<P>
Second, we're publishing the median sales price, rather than an adjusted 
average price. The median price means that half the homes sold for more and 
half the homes sold for less, and is considered a more accurate gauge of home 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
We report prices for seven Southland counties on a five-week cycle, and we 
start today with Los Angeles County. Next week will feature Orange County, then 
San Diego, then Riverside and San Bernardino counties, then Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties, and back to Los Angeles, with a new batch of updated sales 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
With that introduction, turn to K21, and you'll see how easy it is to use our 
more precise reporting format to check the condo and single-family home market 
in your part of town and your neighborhood or -- and this can be useful -- your 
dream neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say, for example, that you live in a condo in Culver City, in ZIP Code 
90230, or that you'd like to. 
</P>
<P>
Check the chart and map layout on K21 for Zone 12, which includes Culver City, 
Santa Monica, Venice, Rancho Park and Palms. 
</P>
<P>
You'll see that the median-price existing single-family homes in the area in 
August was $370,000, down 2.6% from a year ago August, and that 166 houses were 
sold in the reporting month. The median price of existing condos was $263,000, 
down .7%, and a total of 75 were sold. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of newly built homes and condos, light in some areas and heavy in others, 
is reported as a combined figure on the third line. In Zone 12, 21 new units 
were built and sold for a median price of $249,000. Because they are new, there 
is no comparison to last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now turn to K20 to check prices in ZIP Code 90230. There you'll see that median 
house prices, at $289,000, have dropped 7%, and condo prices, at $175,000, have 
risen 17%, and that total sales are less than half what they were in the same 
month a year ago. (For all counties besides Los Angeles, you'll find zone and 
ZIP data combined on one chart.) 
</P>
<P>
Our new home price information is provided by Dataquick, a San Diego-based real 
estate information service company, which gathers its data on California's 11 
million pieces of real estate from public records in each of the state's 52 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Among Dataquick's 5,000 customers are government agencies, lending and 
financial institutions, title companies and other commercial users, and 
increasingly, consumers. 
</P>
<P>
By calling Dataquick and paying a fee, home buyers, home sellers or simply 
interested homeowners can tap into the company's storehouse of real estate 
information for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Checking "comps," or what homes of comparable size and condition have sold 
for recently in the neighborhood, a useful tool for prospective buyers or 
sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Checking the sales history of a house under consideration for purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Checking the general price level of a neighborhood for purposes of 
refinancing or taking out a home equity loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, this information has really only been available to the people on 
the other side of the desk when you want to buy, sell or borrow," said 
Dataquick president Donald Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
"The more knowledge you have when you're negotiating, the better off you are," 
he said. "Access to good information empowers the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
Just as any successful "remodel" requires high-quality craftsmen, our make over 
of Southland Home Prices couldn't have been accomplished without the help of 
Times' graphics editor Michael Chaplin, computer systems architect Victor 
Pulver and copy editor David Van Houten, and Dataquick's vice president of 
technical services, Larry Denning, and product development manager Chris Smith.

HOT PROPERTY: IT'S CIAO TO SINGER'S ITALIAN-STYLE VILLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pop singer KENNY LOGGINS -- who is working on a new album, "Leap of Faith," to 
be released early next year before he goes on tour -- and his wife, Eva, have 
put their nearly 20-acre Montecito home on the market at $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
The couple is selling because they filed for divorce, sources say. They have 
been married for 12 years and have three children. 
</P>
<P>
They had the home built two years ago after touring Italy with their architect, 
Barry Berkus. Berkus designed the compound to take advantage of the ocean and 
mountain views and to capture the 8th- through 16th-Century Tuscan hill town 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to make the Loggins' home seem as if it had evolved over time, 
like a town through the ages. Centuries-old beams and timbers were used to 
create the villa, along with antique pavers, handcrafted iron, blown glass and 
hand-made bricks. 
</P>
<P>
The home has nine bedrooms, 10 1/2 baths, five kitchens, three laundry rooms, 
seven fireplaces, a four-car attached garage and a two-car detached garage/work 
shop with toy storage. 
</P>
<P>
There is an 8,500-square-foot main house, guest house or nanny's quarters, pool 
house, caretaker's cottage, sports complex and kennel. 
</P>
<P>
The home also has a well, stream, pool, spa, pond, two waterfalls and 
fountains. There is a tree house in the yard, an orchard, vineyard bearing 
Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, and rose, vegetable and herb gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Penelope Williams of Prudential Rodeo Realty, Montecito, has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Hills home of the late politician EVELLE YOUNGER has been sold, 
and his widow, Mildred, has purchased a smaller home in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Younger, who died of heart disease in the house in May, 1989, was Los Angeles 
County district attorney during the prosecutions of mass murderer Charles 
Manson and Sirhan Sirhan, assassin of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Later, as state 
attorney general, he ran for governor, losing to Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
His widow, the daughter of a politician, shared his lifelong bent for politics 
and was once a candidate for the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't live in the Hollywood Hills home very long," said Jack Hupp, who 
represented her with Betty Kelly, also of his Beverly Hills realty firm. "They 
bought it in 1987. Then Evelle Younger passed away very suddenly, and she was 
left alone in a rather large house; she felt like she wanted someplace a little 
smaller." 
</P>
<P>
The Youngers' Hollywood Hills home was described as about 4,000 square feet in 
size. The new house is a little smaller, one story with a pool, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
She paid $1.5 million for her new home, according to public records, and sold 
her Hollywood Hills home for $2.1 million through Jan Smith of Rodeo Realty. 
Her new Beverly Hills home had been listed by Ron de Salvo of Douglas 
Properties. 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY SASSOON, former wife of hair-expert VIDAL SASSOON who has her own 
cosmetics/skin-care line and published her first novel, "Fantasies," last 
February, has listed her Holmby Hills home at $1.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Her four kids (from her marriage to Sassoon) are all grown and moved out, so 
she's shopping for a condo on the Wilshire Corridor," said Carrie Winston, 
Sassoon's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The four-bedroom, 4 1/2-bath Holmby house was remodeled and expanded about six 
years ago, according to Pat Meder, who has the listing with Fred Sands' Century 
City/Holmby Hills office. 
</P>
<P>
"They added a second story then and redid the house from stem to stern," she 
said. The contemporary-style home has skylights, an office and a fireplace in 
the master suite. 
</P>
<P>
The original house was built about 50 years ago. Sassoon has owned the property 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Actor SIDNEY TOLER, who appeared in 22 movies, mainly during the 1940s as the 
detective Charlie Chan, planned to build a palace on a Hollywood hilltop but 
died in 1947 after starting the grading, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-acre site, in the area known as Mt. Olympus, stood barren until George 
Hillinger, a retired importer/exporter, and his wife, Vera, bought the tract 
and subdivided it, selling four acres and keeping three. The other seven are on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Hillingers are building a 14,000-square-foot mansion on the hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their dream house," said architect Rick Schwartz about the Hillingers' 
estate, which he estimated will cost almost $2 million to build, not including 
site development and other expenses, by the time the place is completed next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-bedroom, 10-bath home will have an interior/exterior swimming pool, 
two-story entrance with a dome and a skylight, a cantilevered dance floor to 
accommodate 200 guests, a small lake with a waterfall, a fire pit with a 
sitting area and a view of Mt. Baldy to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The Hillingers have no children. "But they like to entertain," Schwartz said.

SEVERAL HOUSING CHOICES AVAILABLE TO ELDERLY WHO NEED HELP GETTING ALONG IN 
THEIR LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles and Bernice Schatz, both in their 80s, enjoy a life style that's 
usually reserved for movie moguls and banking barons. 
</P>
<P>
They awake to a nicely prepared breakfast of fresh fruit, coffee, cereal and 
juices. Lunch includes a variety of salads, soups, fish and omelet. Suppertime 
brings more soup, salad and a selection of entrees ranging from meat loaf to 
brisket -- all prepared by a kosher chef. 
</P>
<P>
Maids change the couple's linen and clean their home. If they want to go 
shopping or sightseeing, a driver will take them. And soon, a staff of nurses 
will be moving in a few doors down to provide them with 24-hour-a-day medical 
care if they ever get sick. 
</P>
<P>
But the Schatzes aren't millionaires: All these services and a roomy, 
two-bedroom apartment in Mission Viejo's Heritage Pointe retirement community 
cost them $2,600 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rent isn't cheap, it's about what they would pay if they bought a 
modest-sized home in the same area and gave up all the pampering that they 
currently enjoy -- not to mention the complex's pool, spa, library and 
synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
"We just love it," said Bernice Schatz. "No cooking, no cleaning, and 
everything you could imagine is right at our fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling Heritage Pointe project is just one type of development that 
gerontologists call "supportive housing" -- homes where residents receive 
varying levels of assistance and service, from light housekeeping to intensive 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all sorts of choices for people who need some help getting along in 
their lives," said Leah Dobkin, a housing specialist with the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
"The type of place you choose depends a lot on your medical needs." 
</P>
<P>
If you're basically healthy but want some help with housekeeping chores, Dobkin 
says, you might consider moving to a board-and-care home or cooperative-housing 
development. The rent you pay typically includes a room, board and utilities as 
well as housekeeping help and laundry services. For an extra charge, some 
board-and-care operators provide more personalized help with bathing, grooming 
and the like. 
</P>
<P>
If you want more professionalized and extensive attention, you might be better 
off in a "congregate-care" facility. 
</P>
<P>
Most congregate-care developments provide residents with their own apartment, 
including a small kitchen area, to prepare light meals and snacks. However, 
you'll eat most of your meals in a central dining facility with other 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most board-and-care homes, congregate facilities usually house hundreds 
of people and typically employ several professionals -- from nutritionists to 
recreation directors -- on a part-time or full-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
Many congregate-care projects are sponsored by nonprofit groups. Residents are 
often provided with transportation to shopping facilities or medical centers, 
as well as regularly scheduled social events and recreational activities. 
</P>
<P>
"A congregate-care project usually offers more services than a board-and-care 
facility," Dobkin said. "You don't give up your privacy or independence, but 
you also have lots of opportunity to interact with people your own age." 
</P>
<P>
People who need more extensive medical attention -- or expect to need it 
sometime in the future -- often opt for "continuing-care" facilities. Sometimes 
called "life-care" complexes, they're a hybrid of congregate-care homes and a 
small hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing apartments, meals and social activities, the projects 
typically have nurses and even doctors on the site to provide various medical 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Many operators of life-care developments require people to pay a hefty 
"entrance fee" before they're allowed to move in -- a charge that can top 
$50,000 or even $100,000. Most also charge monthly rents that can easily exceed 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the operator promises to provide you with housing, certain types 
of medical care and other services for the rest of your life. 
</P>
<P>
If you need more comprehensive and extended medical help than a continuing-care 
facility can provide, you might need to move to a nursing home facility. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing homes typically provide around-the-clock medical care under the 
direction of a physician. They usually offer two levels of service -- 
intermediate care and skilled-nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't live independently but don't need constant, intensive medical 
care, then you would probably require intermediate care," Dobkin said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, if you need a lot of medical attention, but you don't need 
to stay in the hospital, the nursing home will give you skilled-nursing care." 
</P>
<P>
Many nursing homes also provide other services, such as meals and special help 
with bathing and grooming. Some also offer physical therapy programs, 
counseling services and social or recreational activities. 
</P>
<P>
No matter which type of supportive housing you choose, you'll need to ask lots 
of questions to ensure that you'll be happy with your choice and get the help 
that you need. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't just talk to the salesman who's trying to get you to move in: Talk to 
the director of the development, the manager, the people on the staff and 
especially the people who'll be providing you with medical care if you need 
it," said Carole Keller, an Irvine-based housing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't just be living in the complex -- you'll be depending on all these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The location of the complex is also important, especially if you no longer 
drive or have problems getting around. Make sure it's close to the people and 
places that are important to you: family, friends, shopping facilities, places 
of worship and the like. 
</P>
<P>
If you're planning to take meals at the development, eat there a few times 
before you move in to check the quality of the food. 
</P>
<P>
Ask if there's a variety of entrees every day instead of just one or two, and 
see if food can be served in your room if you're ever unable to make it to the 
dining hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Also make sure the kitchen can meet any special dietary needs you might have," 
said Dobkin at the AARP. "If you're a vegetarian, on a low-sodium diet or eat 
only kosher food, you've got to make sure that your needs can be accommodated." 
</P>
<P>
Find out what other types of services the operator of the project provides. If 
transportation, recreational activities or certain types of medical care are 
important to you, make sure that they're available. 
</P>
<P>
Dobkin also suggests that you talk to people who already live in the complex to 
see how they like their lifestyle and the services that the operator provides. 
</P>
<P>
You can feel confident about moving into a development where people have 
nothing but good things to say, but be wary of a project filled with 
disgruntled residents. 
</P>
<P>
Many congregate-care facilities, nursing homes and other supportive-housing 
developments have associations that allow residents to participate in the 
governing of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Ask if the project has such a group, and then see if you can talk to one if its 
members to hear what kinds of issues are raised at the meetings and how 
management reacts to the residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Also ask whether the development has rules on how long guests may stay. If you 
don't have any room to have someone stay over, see if the project has guest 
quarters where visitors from out of town can spend a night or two. 
</P>
<P>
It's also vital to make sure you understand what's covered by the monthly check 
you make out, and what costs extra. 
</P>
<P>
For example, some operators provide light-housekeeping services but charge 
extra for linen service: Many limit the health and medical-care coverage that's 
included in the regular fee. 
</P>
<P>
If you'll have to pay an up-front "entry fee" to move into the development, 
you'll want to ask about the refund policy if you eventually must move away for 
health or other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a good idea to request a copy of the community's most recent 
financial statements, and then have them reviewed by an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"Some projects have gone 'belly-up' and left their residents high and dry," 
Keller said. "In some cases, people have lost their entire life savings." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any contracts or other documents you must sign should first be 
reviewed by an attorney whom you trust. 
</P>
<P>
All states require that nursing homes be licensed. So if you're thinking of 
moving to such a facility, you'll want to contact the state agency that's in 
charge of the licensing program to check out the operator's history and 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
As in many states, California residents can visit the nearest office of the 
state Health Services Department and request a computerized "profile" of any 
nursing home that they're considering. 
</P>
<P>
"The profile tells you whether the home is certified for Medicare or Medi-Cal, 
the results of the government's annual inspection, and any citations that have 
been issued against the home," said Scott Lewis, a spokesman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest branch of the department is listed under the "state government 
offices" heading in the white pages of the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Medicaid program and California Medi-Cal program -- as well as 
private health insurance companies -- will usually only reimburse a portion of 
your nursing home expenses. 
</P>
<P>
So, said the AARP's Dobkin, it's important to ask the nursing home operator 
what might happen if your personal funds become depleted and you must rely 
completely on government aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Some nursing homes will accept the government's check as payment in full, but 
others won't," Dobkin said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't work things out ahead of time, you might be forced to move if 
your money runs out. That can be really traumatic, especially for an older 
person who is sick or frail." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, experts say, explore all of your various housing alternatives before 
you make your move. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't need much in the way of medical attention, you might be able to 
simply stay where you are now and have someone come in once or twice a week to 
do your cleaning and other household chores. 
</P>
<P>
Or, you could bring in a boarder who'll help around the house and even 
administer medicine in exchange for free or reduced rent. 
</P>
<P>
If mobility is a problem, most homes can usually be inexpensively retrofitted 
with "grab bars," automatic stair lifts and other items to make it easier to 
get around. 
</P>
<P>
Floor plans can be rearranged so you only need to live on one floor or spend 
most of your time in one part of the house. Lighting can be improved to help 
you see better. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you're in constant need of medical attention, you might be able to hire 
a nurse or assistant to look after you for less than you would pay to a nursing 
home or life-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Most older people prefer to stay in their current home for as long as they 
can," said Dr. Jon Pynoos, a professor at USC's Andrus Gerontology Center. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you have to move, don't be afraid. If you study all your options, do 
some homework and keep an upbeat attitude, everything will turn out fine."

<P>
THE MARKET: ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFITS TO ASSUMING A LOAN IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED 
-- LESS OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENT IS "WASTED" ON FINANCE CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A growing number of home buyers are looking for assumable loans, now that home 
sales are down and mortgages rates have inched up. 
</P>
<P>
Assumable loans are loans that you can take over -- or "assume" -- by making 
the seller's monthly mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
For example, say you want to purchase a $150,000 home. The outstanding balance 
of the loan on the property is $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
You may be able to assume the loan by making a $25,000 down payment and taking 
over the seller's monthly payments on the $125,000 balance. 
</P>
<P>
Assumable loans can be attractive for a variety of reasons. Many assumable 
loans were made years ago and carry interest rates that are far below the rates 
you could get if you took out a brand-new loan today. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it's usually cheaper to assume a loan than it is to set up a new 
mortgage because you don't have to pay as much in up-front fees for points and 
other items. 
</P>
<P>
"You usually don't have to fill out as much paper work when you want to assume 
a loan, and the loan-approval process is faster," added Dennis Casey, a senior 
vice president with San Diego-based Home Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of the biggest benefits of assuming a loan is often overlooked: 
More of your monthly payment will go toward the principal amount of the loan 
instead of being "wasted" on finance charges. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you took out a new 30-year loan for $100,000 at 10%, your 
monthly payment would be about $877. In the first month, about $44 would go 
toward principal and the remaining $833 would go toward interest. 
</P>
<P>
If you instead assumed a $100,000 loan at 10% that was five years old, an extra 
$30 each month would go toward principal. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the year, you've saved yourself more than $300. That's not a 
fortune, but it's nothing to sneeze at," said Peter G. Miller, author of "The 
Common Sense Mortgage" (Harper &amp; Row: $7.95). 
</P>
<P>
The process for assuming a loan varies from one lender to the next. Typically, 
your first step is to contact the seller's lender and confirm that the loan is 
assumable. 
</P>
<P>
If the answer is yes, you'll need to ask the lender what requirements must be 
met to make the assumption. You'll also want to find out what type of fees 
you'll be expected to pay: Some lenders charge stiff "assumption fees," while 
others charge very little. 
</P>
<P>
Also, ask if the lender reserves the right to make changes to the loan's 
interest rate and other terms. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of lenders will let you assume their loans, but only if you agree to 
renegotiate the interest rate or pay a lot of fees," said Forrest Pafenberg, a 
lending expert with the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really not much use in assuming a loan if the lender is going to 
readjust your interest rate to market levels." 
</P>
<P>
You'll also have to fill out some paper work, but not as much as you would if 
you were applying for a new mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important items we're going to look at is your credit report," 
said banker Casey. "We're going to make sure that you'll be able to make the 
payments, just like the seller has been doing for years." 
</P>
<P>
Off the record, some lenders admit that they don't scrutinize buyers who want 
to assume a loan quite as closely as they do buyers who are seeking a new 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the equity that the seller has built up provides them with a 
financial cushion if they must eventually foreclose. 
</P>
<P>
"If we made a $100,000 loan on the house 10 years ago and now the house is 
worth $250,000, we can afford to overlook a few problems on the buyer's credit 
record," said one Southland lender. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the buyer assumes the loan and quits making his mortgage payments, 
there's really no way that we're going to lose money if we have to foreclose." 
</P>
<P>
Still, lenders won't just rubber-stamp your request for an assumption. Since 
you can be turned down, protect yourself by including a clause in your offer to 
buy the home that allows you to back out without penalty if the bank won't let 
you assume the loan on its current terms. 
</P>
<P>
If you're selling your home and the buyer wants to take over your payments, 
make sure that he actually gets the lender's approval. 
</P>
<P>
If he instead takes the property "subject to the mortgage," he's not personally 
liable for making the payments. Should he default, it's your credit record 
that's on the line. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some lenders insist that you remain liable for the loan payments even 
if the assumption is approved. 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, at least get the lender to agree to notify you in writing 
if the buyer falls behind on his payments. Or, simply wait for another buyer 
who'll get a new loan in his own name so you won't have to worry if he 
eventually defaults. 
</P>
<P>
Although most fixed-rate loans cannot be assumed, there are two important 
exceptions: loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Assumable FHA and VA loans are often sources of great bargains. We'll talk 
about them next week.

HOW PRICES ARE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a letter "The Price Is Not Right" by Kay Williams (Sept. 9), I 
find it hard to believe Ms. Williams could be so uninformed. Does she truly 
believe brokers and agents set the prices on these properties? If she was told 
that there were multiple offers on the homes she was interested in, they 
obviously were not overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
When agents lists a house, they take the comparables in that area for a 
six-month period, allowing for the number of bedrooms, square footage, 
improvements, etc. Then you arrive at an average selling price -- based on what 
has sold in that neighborhood in the last six months, which is exactly what an 
independent appraiser or a lender will do. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the seller wants top dollar for his property, just as Ms. Williams 
would if she sold. The bottom line is your home is worth whatever someone will 
pay for it, and each seller has a right to a good return on his investment. 
Overpriced houses are not sellable houses -- no one makes money that way.

The articles "Having it All" and "In Full Pursuit of the Good Life" (Sept. 23) 
were of great interest to me. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I found our perfect retirement home at Rancho Monserate Country 
Club in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
It is a 232-unit manufactured-home community with ownership similar to that of 
a condominium. You own your home, the lot which it is located on and equal 
share of all common area. 
</P>
<P>
The common grounds include private streets a nine-hole golf course, putting 
green, two tennis courts, swimming pool, spa, horse shoe court, a club house 
with card rooms, exercise rooms, library and entertainment area. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners have their own golf carts, no green fees for golf or tennis, no 
starting times needed for either. We have found the life style we had always 
hoped for on retirement. We have peace, security, beautiful surroundings, 
entertainment, climate, clean air and people around us who care at a budget 
price we can afford.

'TRADING DOWN' MAY BOOST VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many older people who are trading their large homes for smaller ones may be 
"Trading Down" (Sept. 16) as far as market value goes, but "trading up" with 
respect to assessed value. 
</P>
<P>
Since assessed values are locked in by Proposition 13 at the 1976 value plus 2% 
per year, it's not unusual, for example, for a $1-million dollar home to have 
an assessed value of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
For such a homeowner, trading down to a $400,000 condo would result in a 
doubling of the property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Myers should have mentioned that such an increase in property taxes can be 
avoided by filing a claim with the assessor's office under Proposition 60, 
which allows homeowners 55 or older to transfer the Proposition 13 base-year 
value of their principal dwelling to a replacement dwelling, provided that 
their new house is located in the same county and was of equal or less value 
than their former residence. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve counties also recognize inter-county transfers of Proposition 13 
base-year property tax values. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to income tax on the gain on the sale, Mr. Myers also could have 
mentioned that if one of the spouses had died, the surviving spouse should have 
gotten a stepped-up basis on at least half of the property, and possibly on the 
full value of the property if it was properly held as community property, thus 
reducing or eliminating any capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the income tax and property tax issues, the sale of highly 
appreciated property may have estate tax consequences. Anyone considering a 
sale of such assets should be cautioned to seek appropriate tax counsel.

PUTTING A NEW SPIN ON VENTILATING THE ATTIC; 
</P>
<P>
TURBINES: THEY LOOK LIKE CHEF'S HATS, BUT THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IN COOLING THE 
HOUSE WITHOUT RUNNING UP ENERGY BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have all seen them, those strange looking "chef's hats" spinning on the 
roofs of all kinds of buildings. What are they you may have wondered? 
</P>
<P>
They are called wind-driven turbine ventilators and are, perhaps, one of the 
best investments for home comfort and energy savings you can make if you have 
an attic. 
</P>
<P>
"Wind-driven turbine ventilators can substantially reduce home cooling costs by 
decreasing a home's attic temperature without using household energy," 
according to Builders Emporium's answer man Pop Larson. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how they work: 
</P>
<P>
On a hot day, a normally vented attic (one that has eave and gable vents 
installed as per building code requirements) can be anywhere from 15 to 40 
degrees hotter than the outside temperature. 
</P>
<P>
This heat is transmitted to the living space through the ceiling, resulting in 
an inside temperature of the home often greater than the temperature outside. 
Also, the excess attic heat can keep the house hot even after the sun goes 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, this makes your air conditioner work harder than necessary, costing 
you money. 
</P>
<P>
Since heat rises, the turbine ventilators are installed near the high point of 
the attic to allow the hottest air to escape and create a flow of cool air 
through the existing vents up through the turbine. 
</P>
<P>
The turbines are made of lightweight aluminum and fit over a hole cut in the 
roof. They are built with lifetime lubricated bearings that allow them to 
silently spin in the slightest breeze, and as they do, they "draw" the air out 
of the attic without hookup to any household energy source. It's essentially 
free cooling. 
</P>
<P>
They are designed to deflect even the heaviest rainfall from entering the attic 
even if they are not turning, and their smooth metal surfaces and closely 
spaced openings keep rodents from entering. 
</P>
<P>
The only caveat to satisfactory use of the turbines is proper eave and/or gable 
venting. 
</P>
<P>
Since the turbines allow a flow of air through existing vents, you must make 
sure that your house has a substantial number of screened vents (roughly 4-x-16 
inches) under the eaves or large vents at the gable ends before considering 
installing turbines. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is difficult to quantify the level of energy savings or attic 
temperature reduction from one house to another, it is safe to say that most 
any attic will be cooler. 
</P>
<P>
For example, I have a turbine ventilator on my own home and I did an experiment 
recently in which I measured the attic temperature on a hot day and found it to 
be 95 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
I covered the turbine with a trash bag and checked the temperature 30 minutes 
later and found it to be 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Determining the number of turbines needed in your home is a function of the 
attic square footage. Most manufacturers recommend one 14-inch vent for each 
1,000 square feet of attic. 
</P>
<P>
One common question asked about the turbines is "Will my house be colder in the 
winter with the turbines in place?" 
</P>
<P>
Many hardware stores sell turbine covers designed to keep heat in during the 
winter. However, the turbine manufacturers recommend against covering them 
because of the risk of damage to the bearing or frame. 
</P>
<P>
They point out that in a properly insulated home the heat lost through the 
turbine(s) will be negligible. Also, the added ventilation in winter helps 
reduce wood damaging condensation in the attic, the benefit of which greatly 
overshadows any small heating cost increase. 
</P>
<P>
The one downside to the turbines is that they do not add to the appearance of 
the roof. Therefore, it is important to place them where they will not be seen 
from the street, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
My own turbine is set on the back-yard side of the roof ridgeline, about a foot 
from the roof's high point so the top of the turbine is not seen from the front 
of the house. It is painted (as any turbine can be) to match the color of the 
roof to help camouflage it. 
</P>
<P>
The turbines are available in two sizes, 12 and 14 inches, although I usually 
recommend only the 14-inch size. 
</P>
<P>
Most brands sell for under $50 at major hardware stores and home centers. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is easiest to install the turbines on a flat, asphalt-shingle or 
wood-shake roof, they can go on any type of roof provided there is an attic 
below. Most retailers can recommend individuals or service companies that can 
handle the job.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: STRESS-SKIN PANELING MAKES AIRTIGHT HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am planning to build a new super-efficient house. How 
energy-efficient is stress-skin panel construction? Is it reasonably-priced, 
and can I do some of the construction work myself? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Stress-skin panel construction is probably the most energy-efficient 
and cost-effective building method available today. 
</P>
<P>
With super-high insulation levels and airtightness, a stress-skin panel house 
should have extremely low heating and cooling costs. A reduction of 50% on 
utility bills as compared to a typically constructed house is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Stress-skin panels, made to your building plan, are delivered to your building 
site. You can also select from many standard house design packages to reduce 
the costs. 
</P>
<P>
This construction method is simple and you should be able to do much of the 
work yourself. Most panel manufacturers will rent you any necessary tools. Once 
the foundation or basement is poured, It should only take a few days to close 
in a house (walls and roof). 
</P>
<P>
You can purchase the panels with the openings for windows and doors already cut 
and framed. You just slip them in. If you want to add a window at a later time, 
you just saw a rectangular hole through the wall. Then rout out a little foam, 
frame the opening and set in the window. 
</P>
<P>
A typical structural (no supporting frame needed) stress-skin panel is made of 
thick, rigid foam insulation (insulating R-values up to R-40). A 7/16-inch 
thick sheet of exterior-grade plywood or wafer board is bonded to each side of 
the insulation forming the panel. 
</P>
<P>
You can attach siding, stucco, brick, etc. to the outdoor surface and drywall 
or paneling to the indoor surface. 
</P>
<P>
The foam insulation is routed out to accept standard lumber at the top and 
bottom. Once your foundation is complete and the sill lumber is in place, tilt 
up the free-standing panels and the routed-out bottom fits and seals over the 
sill. 
</P>
<P>
Nail the panels to the sill. Each panel is joined vertically and sealed along 
the joints with 2-by-4 or insulated splines. 
</P>
<P>
Work your way around the foundation until all of the walls are up and properly 
positioned. The corners are nailed together through studs that are in the 
routed-out ends of the corner panels. This forms an extremely strong and rigid 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Electrical wiring chases are provided in the insulation behind the indoor wafer 
skin. It makes wiring easy with no air leaks or insulation voids as with 
studded-wall construction. 
</P>
<P>
Since a stress-skin panel house is so efficient and airtight, you should 
install an air-to-air heat exchanger ventilation system. This gives you 
complete control over the ventilation in your house. Outdoor noise, dust, 
pollens, etc. are almost totally eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 374 showing a list of 
stress-skin panel manufacturers, typical panel specifications, and a floor plan 
layout and exterior diagram of a typical stress-skin panel house. Please 
include $1 and a self-addressed, stamped business-size envelope. Send your 
requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Dr., 
Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Accurate Thermostat Should Be Level 
</P>
<P>
Q: When I had my house interior painted, the painter loosened the thermostat 
and retightened it slightly crooked. Will that effect the operation of my 
central air conditioner and furnace? 
</P>
<P>
A: It can definitely affect the temperature calibration. Most standard wall 
thermostats have a liquid mercury switch in them. As the bimetallic strip 
inside reacts to temperature changes, the mercury flows back and forth to 
control heating and cooling. It must be level to be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clothes Dryer Takes Longer to Do Job 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our clothes dryer seems to get hot, but it is taking longer to dry our 
clothes. I keep the lint filter clean. What could be the problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: A clothes dryer uses a lot of energy, and the extra running time can get 
expensive. If your dryer is still getting hot, then your problem probably is 
inadequate air flow. One cause may be the vent duct has become clogged with 
lint. Pull the duct loose from the back of the dryer and run a rag on a coat 
hanger through it. Another possible cause is that the flapper on the outside 
vent is sticking closed. Make sure it swings freely. 
</P>

be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,

HOMEWISE: ANIMALS OR DRUG LAB COULD CAUSE BAD ODOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We have a distressing, urine-like smell in the entry area of our home 
-- on a section of cedar wall and a wall corner leading to the basement. Since 
mice have been a problem in the past, I thought maybe one or more had died in 
the walls. A pest control company assured me that this particular smell isn't 
caused by mice. We don't have cats or dogs. Any idea what the cause might be? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Since the odors are localized and limited to these two areas, they 
originate either in the wall cavities or the surface wall material. You didn't 
mention how long you have owned your home. Do you know whether the previous 
owners had animals that were kept in the entry area? If so, repeated saturation 
by urine could cause an enduring problem. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't remove or diminish the smell with scrubbing and deodorizers, 
remove one or more outlet or switch plate covers in the problem areas. If the 
smell from the openings intensifies, you know that it's from the cavities. If 
there are no outlets or receptacles, you may want to drill a small test hole in 
the paneling. Choose a hidden area that can be readily plugged without damaging 
the aesthetics. If the smell comes from the wall cavities, remove the inside 
wall covering and clean, deodorize or remove the offending materials. Replace 
saturated insulation and/or wall panels as needed. 
</P>
<P>
There also is an increasingly serious problem that renters, new home buyers and 
those staying in hotels have encountered: strange odors that indicate the past 
presence of an illegal methamphetamine laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1983, three illegal meth labs were discovered by authorities in Washington. 
In 1988, that number escalated to 93," said Gary Irvine, environmental health 
supervisor for the Seattle/King County Department of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals that are used in the production of methamphetamines are known 
carcinogens and very toxic and if the smell resembles that of cat urine and 
can't be removed or deodorized, be suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these labs -- and the chemical contamination -- can go undetected by 
the authorities. People who manufacture these drugs or "meth cookers," as they 
are called, move in, manufacture their drugs and move out before anyone is the 
wiser. Unwitting new occupants can experience health problems -- nausea, nose 
bleeds and general lack of energy. Children are especially susceptible because 
they spend a lot of time on the floor where the chemicals may have spilled. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals readily penetrate concrete floors, sinks, countertops, rugs, 
sheet rock, even structural framing. Some dwellings and hotel rooms become so 
contaminated, that they can no longer be occupied. So contaminated that, if 
torn down, the materials need to be stored in a hazardous-waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
Abandoned chemicals tend to be left in unlabeled glass jars and may have 
corrosion around metallic covers. "Look for stains on the floors or walls, 
abandoned glassware or hoses. There is no specific pattern for housing units 
that might be affected. Labs have been discovered in expensive waterfront 
homes, tract houses, mobile homes, trailers, duplexes and even hotel rooms," 
Irvine said. 
</P>
<P>
If a building has been identified by a law enforcement agency as a former drug 
lab that has housed hazardous chemicals, the law requires the owner to inform 
new purchasers and occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Private testing firms can monitor for indoor air, surface soil and water 
contamination. More and more, real estate contracts contain hazardous-waste 
clauses that protect the purchaser against property contamination. 
</P>
<P>
If you think you have this problem, contact either your local health or police 
department. They can advise you over the phone or send someone out to help 
assess the situation. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier column, the news from Kuwait inspired us to write about the 
progress we've made since the '70s in reducing energy consumption. Also offered 
was practical advice for reducing our individual consumption of oil. 
</P>
<P>
We focused on the biggest oil user for us all -- our cars. Convenient as they 
are, our cars use more energy than our houses and appliances combined. Readers 
in the market for a new or used car have a great opportunity to buy a 
fuel-efficient one. 
</P>
<P>
Our advice? Try to find one that gets at least 35 miles per gallon (m.p.g.). 
Already, there are models available that get over 50 m.p.g. Look for the EPA's 
gas mileage ratings -- they appear on all new cars and the EPA Gas Mileage 
Guides for years past can be referenced for used cars. 
</P>
<P>
In EPA's 1989 Gas Mileage Guide, the following models rated in the 30s or 
higher for both city and highway driving. Safety ratings are indicated as well.

One of modern technology's more common items, the smoke detector, is being 
ignored by many owners, often to their peril. 
</P>
<P>
Non-working smoke detectors contribute to as many as 6,000 fire-related deaths 
and 130,000 injuries each year, according to Change Your Clock, Change Your 
Battery, a cooperative campaign sponsored by the International Assn. of Fire 
Chiefs, the American Burn Assn. and Eveready Battery Co. 
</P>
<P>
They hope that tying in the ritual of time change Oct. 28 with the routine of 
changing batteries will increase the number of working smoke alarms and 
emergency flashlights. The group estimates that 50% of home smoke alarms now 
are useless because of old or missing batteries. And without working 
flashlights, the difficulty of locating safe, swift exits in night fire 
situations increases. 
</P>
<P>
Besides this annual routine, checking the batteries with the test button at 
least once a month is recommended.

POST CARDS FROM THE EDGE OF THE QUIET CANYON

GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alone in one of America's most popular national parks? It seemed, well, almost 
unnatural. 
</P>
<P>
But a ranger at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona suggested that I catch 
the sunrise from Point Imperial on the North Rim -- the highest point (at 8,803 
feet) on either rim of the canyon. So the very next morning, ever the dutiful 
tourist, I made the 12-mile, sleepy-eyed drive from my cabin, arriving just in 
time to grab a seat on a flat rock for the first rays of the sun's colorful 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The dawn danced quickly across the canyon walls, spotlighting hues of red and 
orange and purple like a spinning kaleidoscope gone wild. Morning is the best 
time to view the colors before they are washed out by midday glare. A slight 
breeze, stirring the pines, hummed a daybreak anthem to accompany the display. 
</P>
<P>
Except for two rock squirrels playing tag on a nearby pine, I was alone. It was 
both surprising and wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
In a year, the Grand Canyon attracts about 3.5 million visitors. On a busy 
August day, like the one just then aborning, more than 20,000 tourists will be 
on hand, most of them at bustling Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim. 
</P>
<P>
When conservationists talk about America's overused parklands, one of the 
places they generally have in mind is the village -- a hub of hotels, lodges, a 
youth hostel, museums, restaurants, snack bars and curio shops on the canyon's 
edge. Crowds pour in from the parking lots in waves. 
</P>
<P>
No one except me, however, had been tempted by Point Imperial's sunrise on this 
particular day. I have swarmed with the photo-snapping throngs on the South Rim 
in the past, but on this visit I went in search of some of the park's special 
solitary places. You can, I was discovering, still find solitude in the Grand 
Canyon without wandering far from the well-trod paths. 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors, I suspect, arrive at the South Rim village, walk a few steps 
from the parking lot to peer into the giant chasm and figure they have seen the 
Grand Canyon. I thought so, anyway, on my first trip 30 years ago. The three of 
us, recent college grads on a Western camping spree, spent maybe an hour at the 
South Rim, part of the time buying post cards, and then left feeling strangely 
disappointed. Only on later visits did I come to realize that the canyon 
impresses most when you get to know it better. 
</P>
<P>
Once I swept through the canyon on a nine-day rafting adventure, camping under 
the stars each night on sandy beaches beneath the towering walls. The trip was 
exciting, but I was surprised how varied the scenery was deep down at the 
bottom of the canyon. Every twist of the river yielded a new perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Our raft held only 15 people (including two guides), and only rarely did we 
float past another raft. Thus, I got my first taste of the park without the 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
I even began to appreciate the South Rim, once I had stuck around long enough 
to learn about the West Rim Trail. The trail begins roughly at the front door 
of El Tovar Lodge, an elegantly restored historic hotel in the heart of the 
village, and follows the sweeping curves of the canyon west for eight miles to 
Hermits Rest. 
</P>
<P>
For the first mile or so, the trail is paved and as packed as any downtown 
street, but traffic thins quickly the farther you walk. Every yard you cover 
offers yet new canyon views and an inviting perch on which to sit and 
contemplate them. I packed a lunch and made a day of it. 
</P>
<P>
The trail is mostly level and well-worn, and you are never very far from rescue 
should you tire along the way. Parallel to the trail but usually just out of 
sight is West Rim Drive. During the busy summer months, the drive is closed to 
all vehicles except passenger shuttle buses. 
</P>
<P>
The buses make pickup stops along the full length of the drive, so you can hike 
the trail one way and take the bus the other. Remember to walk with the sun at 
your back so that you can see the play of light on the canyon walls ahead. 
</P>
<P>
If I had so easily overlooked West Rim Trail on my initial visits to the park, 
I wondered, what else must I be missing? 
</P>
<P>
So when my schedule allowed a brief return to the canyon last August -- this 
time to the North Rim -- the first thing I did was put the question to the 
park's staff, and ranger Dale Schmidt, supervisor of programs at the North Rim, 
obliged. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-year veteran of the canyon, he filled me in on several short day-hikes 
that would give me little-seen, unjostled glimpses of the canyon. And then, as 
if to tempt me to a return visit, he disclosed some of his favorite hidden 
spots in the most remote corners of the huge wilderness park. 
</P>
<P>
I met Schmidt when I signed on for an afternoon's hike that he was leading 
along the Widforss Trail. On our trek, I told him of my interest in the Grand 
Canyon's less-visited areas. My query prompted him to gather his flock of 
hikers for a brief lecture on the differences between the park's South and 
North rims. For visitors who want to avoid the park's crowds, he told us, the 
North Rim is the place to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors see one or the other rim of the canyon, but generally not both on 
the same trip. A 21-mile hiking trail links the two rims -- down one side of 
the canyon and up the other -- and a very strong hiker can make it in a day, 
although an overnight stay at the canyon bottom is recommended. 
</P>
<P>
The shortest drive between the rims is 215 miles, and the trip takes about five 
hours. Both rims offer grand viewpoints of the canyon, though good viewing 
areas are more easily reached on the South Rim. 
</P>
<P>
While the South Rim averages about 20,000 visitors a day, said Schmidt, the 
more remote North Rim averages only 2,000. The difference is easily explained. 
The South Rim offers about 1,400 overnight accommodations, the North Rim fewer 
than 300. Also, the South Rim is open year-round, but snow closes the North Rim 
from about mid-October to mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
Because the South Rim is 1,000 feet lower than the North, it gets less snow and 
rain. Warmed by winds from the canyon's interior, its vegetation is sparse and 
desert-like. The North Rim is heavily wooded, its meadows lush and dotted with 
wildflowers. You feel as if you are in a northern forest. "On this plateau," 
said Schmidt, "the deer outnumber the people." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt's basic guideline for getting away from the Grand Canyon's crowds is to 
get a good map "and see where most people would not want to go." That generally 
means some place reached by dirt roads, hiking trials or no trails at all. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he advises, pick your seasons carefully. Summer is busy, spring and fall 
are less so, and winter is the time for real solitude. 
</P>
<P>
Among Schmidt's suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ken Patrick Trail: "It's quite under-used." Twelve miles one way, the trail 
is the hiker's route from the Grand Canyon Lodge area on the North Rim to Point 
Imperial. It follows the canyon rim east through thick forests, and the climb 
is gentle. You probably will want to arrange to be picked up at the end of the 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rim-to-rim hike: You can do it in either direction. From the North Rim, 
you descend for 14 miles on the North Kaibab Trail to Phantom Ranch or Bright 
Angel Campground at the canyon's bottom (overnight reservations are required at 
both). Early the next morning, make the steep seven-mile ascent of Bright Angel 
Trail. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer months, a van makes a daily shuttle between the two rims to 
return you to your starting point. The shuttle departs the South Rim at 7 a.m. 
and the North Rim at 3 p.m. The one-way fare is $50. 
</P>
<P>
To escape the masses, a hiker can descend either of the trails part way and 
double back on the same day. Hiking down is deceptively easy; the climb back up 
at the park's high elevation can be very difficult. On any summer hike into the 
canyon, avoid the heat of midday. On the trail, carry plenty of water -- a 
gallon a day per person is recommended -- because the temperature in the inner 
canyon can soar above 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Several other trails descend into the canyon, but they are not always 
maintained. They are linked by the 70-mile Tonto Trail below the South Rim, 
making it possible to plan a circle route in and out of the canyon. If you are 
unfamiliar with the canyon's hazards, consult rangers before attempting such a 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kaibab National Forest: "There's a lot of territory out there." The vast 
pine forest serves as a protective barrier north of the park's border on the 
North Rim. It is laced with dirt roads, several of which lead to Grand Canyon 
overlooks reached no other way. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt suggests taking the Widforss Road that continues 17 miles beyond the 
Widforss trail head to Point Sublime, which he calls "one of the best 
viewpoints in the park." You probably will need a pickup truck or other vehicle 
with a high chassis. Mountain bicycles are becoming increasingly popular on the 
forest roads. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in the national park, camping is permitted almost anywhere in the forest 
without a fee, although developed campgrounds also are available at three 
remote canyon viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 -- East Rim: This is a five-mile hike that begins just east of Grand Canyon 
Village on the South Rim. Go out to Yaki Point, a popular viewing spot where 
the mule trips emerge from the canyon on the South Kaibab Trail. Then, says 
Schmidt, "take a hard right turn and walk to Shoshoni Point." No official trail 
exists, which eliminates most foot traffic, but if you follow the rim there is 
no great risk of getting lost. On your left will be the canyon; on your right, 
but generally at a distance, will be East Rim Drive, the first leg of the 
highway to the North Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Supai: "One of the more sublime places." The tiny village of the Havasupai 
Indians, Supai lies deep in the Grand Canyon far to the west of Grand Canyon 
Village. It can be reached only by foot or horseback over an eight-mile trail 
or by helicopter, and visitors are welcome at a small guest house and 
campground. Near the village, the clear waters of Havasu Creek tumble in a 
series of waterfalls into inviting pools. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hermit Trail: "One of my favorites -- the geology is fabulous," says 
Schmidt. Beginning at Hermits Rest on the South Rim, the trail makes a 
nine-mile descent to the Colorado River at Hermit Rapids. In rafting season, 
you won't always be alone. But you will have one of the best vantage points in 
the entire canyon to watch the passenger-filled boats plunge through the 
rapids. 
</P>
<P>
For a good circle route, descend Bright Angel Trail from Grand Canyon Village, 
turn west on the Tonto Trail and ascend the Hermit Trail to catch the shuttle 
bus back to Grand Canyon Village. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tuweep: Located in what the Park Service calls one of the most remote 
desert pockets of the United States, Tuweep offers an unusual view of the 
canyon not seen elsewhere from either the North or the South rim. In most 
places, the canyon averages about 10 miles in width, but at Tuweep it narrows 
to less than a mile. From the viewpoint, the canyon wall plunges a straight 
3,000 feet, and you can see the river clearly below. 
</P>
<P>
The viewpoint can be reached by one of three dirt roads -- from 55 to 90 miles 
long -- that head south from Arizona Route 389 west of Fredonia. There is a 
modest campground, but no water is available. The Park Service warns that the 
drive should not be attempted "without ample preparation, including water, 
food, gasoline and tools." 
</P>
<P>
And, oh yes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Point Imperial at sunrise: Ranger Schmidt casually mentioned this easy 
excursion during our group hike along the Widforss Trail. I sensed it was a 
gentle hint to the lot of us that we had only begun to discover the hidden 
Grand Canyon. Thus nudged, I was wonderfully rewarded by the beauty of the 
canyon's solitude. Alone in the Grand Canyon? It's the best way to see this 
magnificent park.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: KINGDOM OF BHUTAN TO REOPEN SOME SITES

The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which closed all monasteries, temples and 
other religious sites to tourists nearly three years ago, will reopen selected 
sites beginning Jan. 1, according to officials of the Bhutan Tourism Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The move is one of several recently announced changes in tourism policy that 
may result in the remote nation attracting more visitors, which now number 
fewer than 1,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes include a lowering of tourist rates by 10% to 30%, although fees 
during peak season will continue to top $200 a day, including board, meals and 
guides. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny Tibetan Buddhist country, which places unusual emphasis on the 
preservation of its national heritage and identity, has in the past severely 
restricted entry to foreigners and still virtually prohibits individual travel. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, according to Jigme Tshultim, managing director of the 
Bhutan Tourism Corp., up to 4,000 visitors a year can be anticipated. The 
corporation, previously run by the government, now is privately run, but will 
continue to coordinate all tour groups. Three other private tour agencies also 
have been established in Thimphu, the Bhutanese capital. 
</P>
<P>
In closing all monasteries, temples and dzongs -- religious and administrative 
fortresses -- to foreigners in January, 1988, the government was responding to 
pressure from the Central Monk Body, the nation's premier religious 
institution. The monk body had been receiving complaints from more remote 
villages about tourists taking photographs in temples and handling artifacts, 
both of which are still prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national airline, Druk Air, has announced that it will increase 
its flights to Bangkok to twice a week beginning Oct. 27. K.E.S. KIRBY

Quick Fact: There are no passenger trains in Swaziland. 
</P>
<P>
Dial-a-Flight: Air travelers faced with increasingly common arrival and 
departure delays will soon have a new service offering the actual times they 
can expect to lift off and touch down. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers of Official Airline Guides have established a telephone service 
at O'Hare International in Chicago -- the world's busiest airport -- that soon 
will be implemented at other airports around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers from anywhere in the United States can call an area code 900 number 
-- for 75 cents a minute -- punch in the flight number and hear a recording 
that will give actual times as well as gate information, updated every 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The service will be expanded to La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark airports in the 
New York area, plus Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Atlanta, 
Denver, Boston, Washington National and Dulles airports, Miami and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to call the airlines directly and receive the same information 
free, but OAG claims that airline telephone operators do not have the same 
updated information available to them and are geared more toward booking 
flights than providing information.

Close Encounters in Elmwood: While other small towns across the country have 
their corn boils, pumpkin festivals and fishing derbies, tiny Elmwood, Wis., 
population 1,009, makes its mark with "UFO Days." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent of those celebrations attracted 2,000 tourists, some dressed 
like Hollywood-issue aliens. They watched parades, danced in the street, rode 
carnival rides, ate UFO burgers and saw the crowning of a UFO queen. 
</P>
<P>
Concession stands did a brisk business in inflatable rocket ships, T-shirts, 
caps, mugs, ashtrays, badges, bumper stickers and cosmic headdresses, the 
manufacture of which has become somewhat of a cottage industry locally. 
</P>
<P>
Children chased through the streets gathering 500 paper plates dropped from an 
airplane. The imitation flying saucers were redeemable for prizes ranging from 
five to 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
True to form, the 4-H Club ran a cow chip-throwing contest.

cities. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Honolulu was Orlando, Fla., with an occupancy rate of 85%. The national 
average was 67.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed Hawaii as having a higher occupancy rate than any other 
state -- almost 84%. The national average by state was 66%. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii also has higher room rates than other states. The daily rate of $113 was 
significantly higher than the national average of $78.

An Idea That Might Fly: The Children's Museum of Denver has devised a way to 
keep children from being bored while awaiting flights at Stapleton 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"KidsPort" is made up of five exhibits built around interactive play. For 
example, "How Am I?" gives children the opportunity to analyze their daily 
diets and physical condition. "The Rocky Mountain Climbing Experience" is a 
simulated climb up a mountain "wall." There's also a cushioned "Baby 
Playspace," plus a diaper-changing area, a gift shop and information monitors. 
</P>
<P>
KidsPort is open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $1.50 per person; 
children under 2 are admitted free. It is located in the grand concourse at the 
airport's C terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in Space: It may be nothing more than "an overgrown wilderness of blasted 
concrete," as one wire service described it, but Peenemuende in East Germany 
could well become a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation and military history buffs already are coming to the former Nazi V-2 
rocket-testing site on the Baltic island of Usedom, a four-hour drive northeast 
of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The coming of democracy to East Germany has made Peenemuende accessible to 
visitors for the first time, and plans for its future include museums, low-key 
tourism and possibly what one German businessman termed a "world peace park." 
</P>
<P>
It was at Peenemuende on Oct. 3, 1942, that a V-2 blasted off, grazed the outer 
skin of the atmosphere and plunged to earth 120 miles away in man's first 
controlled ballistic missile flight. 
</P>
<P>
The hidden ruins of the site lie in thick forest, but they have been mapped by 
Peenemuende-based East German Navy Capt. Bernd Fischer and Air Force Maj. 
Joachim Saathoff, who are studying the history of the V-2 proving ground. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the V-2 and those who developed it laid the foundation for 40 
years of space achievements. 
</P>
<P>
The site deserved a place in German history that would reflect its 
revolutionary contribution to flight technology without ignoring its dark role 
in warfare, Fischer said.

DEER ROAM THE STREETS OF THIS JAPANESE ISLAND THAT'S CONSIDERED SACRED FOR ITS 
NATURAL BEAUTY

MIYAJIMA, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who could argue with a millennium of kudos? Throughout the ages, poets and 
travelers have praised the tiny jade green island of Miyajima, claiming it as 
one of the most beautiful places in all of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
To make it official a thousand years ago, the Japanese pinpointed the three 
most scenic spots in their country and christened them san kei, meaning "three 
views." Though most foreigners have never heard of them, they are legendary 
destinations to the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
To visit Miyajima Island or the two other spots -- Matsushima, an 
island-studded bay north of Tokyo, or Amanohashidate, near Kyoto, with its 
famous gnarled pine trees that are said to resemble the path to heaven -- is 
more a pilgrimage than a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese tourists eagerly collect the souvenirs of each of the san kei, and for 
many Japanese, it is a lifelong dream to journey to all three sites. 
</P>
<P>
One fall we did the trio. We sailed lovely Matsushima Bay in a dragon boat 
blaring Japanese folk music. We stood on the viewpoint above Amanohashidate -- 
though we had to squint a bit to visualize the route to heaven. And we 
discovered Miyajima, the most exquisite of the san kei and a mere speck among 
hundreds of islands in the Inland Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Miyajima could have been lifted from a dreamy, classic Japanese watercolor. 
Each spring the enchanting isle explodes with cherry blossoms. In the fall, 
"viewing autumnal tints," as the brochure puts it, brings hikers to walking 
trails leading into a deep forest that is home to weathered temples, pagodas 
poking their tiled roofs through morning mist and teahouses resting peacefully 
beside waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
After a 12 1/2-mile train trip from Hiroshima, it is only a 10-minute ferry 
ride to Miyajima. 
</P>
<P>
The steep green slopes of the island plunge to the sea, where, wading in a 
shallow bay, sits the tall orange torii (gate) made famous in travel posters. 
Tucked behind it is spectacular Itsukushima Shrine: a Shinto complex of 
pillared orange buildings that appear to float on the water. 
</P>
<P>
We checked into one of the small Japanese inns in the peaceful town, slipped on 
our wooden geta (clogs) and headed for an early hot bath. 
</P>
<P>
Miyajima's peacefulness is partly due to a lack of cars. Apart from a few 
delivery vans, vehicles are not allowed. One of the pleasures of Miyajima is 
watching the town unwind in the evening following the departure of the last 
ferry filled with tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Men congregate in the street to smoke. Kimono-clad women draw their black 
shawls close and gossip in the twilight. Except for the colorful glow from 
electric lanterns strung zigzag across the main street, evening on Miyajima 
hints at the pace of Japan centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
The island dinner specialty is oysters plucked fresh and plump from beds we'd 
seen on our ferry trip across from the mainland. They are delicious served with 
scrambled eggs and scallions over a bowl of rice. For dessert, we purchased 
warm Momiji Manju: tiny maple leaf-shaped cookies filled with sweet bean jam, 
for which Miyajima is famous. 
</P>
<P>
Rising the next morning, we were startled by half a dozen noses poking through 
the doorway curtain. Even knowing in advance about the tame deer that roam 
Miyajima, it was a shock to find droves of them on the main street, panhandling 
and taking advantage of their status as one of the island's sacred animals. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a deft pickpocket tugging from behind pulled a shopping bag from my 
shoulder, scattering the contents across the pavement. The thief looked at us 
with innocent brown eyes, sniffed disdainfully at our spilled post cards and 
strolled off to nibble on a cardboard cutout of a bikini-clad Japanese girl in 
a shop front ad. 
</P>
<P>
Always restrained, Japanese tourists stifled laughter behind hands held 
politely in front of their mouths, unaware that rice biscuits were being 
pilfered out of one of their gaping handbags. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, the island deer have been considered sacred, like those at Nara, 
but this hasn't necessarily made them more tolerant of people. Though generally 
docile, they will, if pestered, drop their heads and charge. But there is 
nothing to fear: their horns have been trimmed to deny them revenge. 
</P>
<P>
While the deer are amusing, guaranteed to impress even the most jaded 
temple-goer is the island's famous shrine -- painted the bright orange of the 
Heian Period (794 to 1192). 
</P>
<P>
With its gabled roofs, the shrine stands above high tide on seven-foot stilts. 
Reflections shimmer on the water and, in a masterful illusion, the pavilions 
and long, open galleries appear to float on the incoming sea. 
</P>
<P>
Monks dressed in white and turquoise gowns tend the immaculate grounds. A musty 
perfume from burning joss sticks fills the air, and paper fortunes bought from 
the monks are tied to lanterns, door handles and tree branches for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
All of Miyajima Island is considered sacred, since the ancient Shinto 
philosophy worships nature. To keep the island pure, strict religious codes 
prohibit the cutting of trees or tilling of soil. And until the Meiji 
Restoration of 1868, when Japan's feudal system was abolished, even births and 
deaths were not allowed on the island. The island still has no graveyard, and 
expectant mothers and the dying are taken to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Salt air and fire have ruined some of the 8th-Century Itsukushima Shrine 
architectural treasures. Yet skilled Japanese craftsmen have made excellent 
reconstructions, such as of the classic half-moon Soribashi Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The red camphor-wood torii, erected in 1875, is 52 feet high -- the tallest in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Contrasting with the bright shrine is the austere weathered wooden Noh Theater, 
alongside. There, once a year, classic Noh theater is performed by elaborately 
costumed actors. Although the original theater dated to 1568, the present 
building was reconstructed during the 1800s. Yet it still is the oldest of its 
kind in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Several festivals take place at Miyajima throughout the year, but the most 
elaborate is the Longevity Festival on July 17. Hundreds of men and boys dive 
into the sea after a sacred wooden ball released by a priest. Whoever retrieves 
the ball gets to keep it and other prizes. But of most importance: He has won 
lifelong happiness. 
</P>
<P>
Early morning is delightful on the island as we set out through the mist into 
the autumn-tinted countryside. 
</P>
<P>
At last we reach the solitude of Senjokaku -- the Hall of a Thousand Tatami, a 
majestic structure with a great, sweeping roof supported on massive wooden 
pillars. (Room size in Japan is traditionally measured by the number of tatami 
mats it takes to cover a floor. A thousand mats is an exaggeration, it turns 
out, since the hall is but 450 mats large.) 
</P>
<P>
The entire building is said to have been made of a single camphor tree, the 
venture supervised by the renowned warrior Hideyoshi in the late 1500s while he 
was planning the invasion of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the town, easy walking trails climb to small inns and teahouses hidden 
among the maple trees. Serious hikers can climb to the summit of Mt. Misen. 
Others can take the easier route via the aerial tramway and explore summit 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
The sound of clattering dishes from a tearoom off the trail hushes the chatter 
of birds. A young woman in a kimono steps from a doorway to tend a smoldering 
pile of raked leaves. With a bow, she wipes her hands on her starched white 
apron. We dive into guide-book Japanese. She defrosts her high school English. 
And we end up laughing at our attempts over a cup of hot green tea and 
biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very honored to have a group of schoolchildren visit from Hiroshima 
today," she says while pointing toward tables set under the trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese love to spoil their children," she says, picking up one of the 
figurine gifts decorating each place setting. When it's time to leave, our 
hostess staunchly refuses payment. "It is my pleasure," she says, bowing. 
"Sometimes we like to spoil visitors, too." 
</P>
<P>
The hum of a generator announces that we are approaching the aerial tramway. 
The 15-minute ascent offers spectacular views across the water to Hiroshima. 
Also visible are the surrounding mountains and the Inland Sea, where boats tend 
hundreds of long wooden rafts used for cultivating oysters and seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
At the summit, we are anxiously met by a playful contingent of Miyajima's other 
protected creature. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese monkeys sit on the station rooftop until the tram docks. Then, with a 
surprising boldness, one of them drops to the ground, screeches and nabs a 
young boy's tin of potato chips. After scurrying to the edge of a cliff, he 
lowers himself out of reach and gleefully stuffs handfuls of chips into his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
With a firm grasp on our camera bag, we make our way through the forest on the 
first leg of a four-mile hiking trail that winds first to the peak of Mt. 
Misen, then via a tortuous route back down to the township. 
</P>
<P>
We're the only hikers on the trail as it steadily climbs to the summit. There, 
overlooking the sea, a 9th-Century monk with an eye for outstanding real estate 
constructed a series of small temples that blend into the rocky mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
A monk in white appears and steps onto a podium adjacent to an enormous 
cast-bronze bell. Slowly he draws back the wooden battering ram and then 
releases it to strike the heavy bell. A single resonant note rolls through the 
forest. As the sound lingers, other monks in dark robes silently make their way 
toward the main temple. A rhythmic chanting starts. We are left completely 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
On our way down the mountain, we hear another bell in the distance. All around 
us deer stir and head in the direction of the sound. It's afternoon feeding 
time at Itsukushima Shrine. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, we are back in town amid a rush of schoolchildren being 
shepherded toward the ferryboat. 
</P>
<P>
A thousand years may have elapsed since Miyajima was declared a san kei, but 
from what we saw, it's a title still deserved.

STEP-BY-STEP ACCOUNT OF A NORTH RIM DESCENT

GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Let's get this over with so I can say I've ridden a mule." 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey dude was bicycling through canyon country, doing the Bryce, 
Zion, Grand Canyon circuit. At the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, he finally 
was persuaded to get on a mule. (He was already at home in a bicycle saddle.) 
</P>
<P>
The trip was a one-day venture on the uncrowded North Kaibab Trail, a five-mile 
descent to Roaring Springs. The route, first tracked by Paiute Indians, 
explores a precipitous side canyon that follows Bright Angel Creek. It offers 
an up-close perspective of the canyon that is totally unlike the wide plateaus 
and panoramas of the South Rim. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 a.m. each morning, up to 20 mule riders assemble at Grand Canyon Lodge 
to be bused to the trailhead. A guide advises that this mule trip is less 
strenuous than the two-day expedition from South Rim to Phantom Ranch and back, 
but it will give a thrill or two. 
</P>
<P>
And that's a fact. The trail drops 4,000 feet, wriggling through shaded woods 
and along cliff-hanger ledges where a rider can touch the fossils in the faces 
of ancient rock. 
</P>
<P>
Given their lead, the sure-footed Jacks and Jennies measure their way around 
"oh-my-gawd-turns," paying no attention to the depths below or towering 
pinnacles above. Riders tend to clutch their saddle horns while clinging to 
windblown hats and dust-covered cameras. 
</P>
<P>
If a mule tries to nibble something green, wrangler Mike Whitney warns: "When 
you lag behind, mules spook, and that leaves a mess of broken bones and brains 
on the trail." 
</P>
<P>
One curious rider is told her animal is named Short Cut because his parachute 
saddle helps him jump to the South Rim. Tall tales are as traditional as mule 
riding, harking back to a time when visitors wouldn't have considered walking 
for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
If there were no canyon here, it would still be exhilarating backcountry. 
Scents of pine and wafts of chill air suggest mountains, not desert. The Kaibab 
Plateau is 1,000 feet higher than the South Rim's Coconino Plateau, and 
noticeably cooler. Because of heavy winter snowfall, the park's limited 
facilities here are open only from mid-May to mid-October. Even in summer it 
seems remote. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge sits tight on the rimrock, 5,700 feet above the unseen canyon floor. 
It serves as a reservations and Park Service information center, and its dining 
room overlooks the gorge, so sunsets are reserved in advance. The patio offers 
front-row seats as well. 
</P>
<P>
This, the only lodge on the North Rim, actually provides no lodging at all, but 
anchors a complex of rustic, comfortable cabins among the pines. Frills consist 
of a gift shop, cafeteria and snack bar. There is a grocery store at the nearby 
campground. 
</P>
<P>
The first lodge was opened in 1928 by the Utah Parks Co., a subsidiary of Union 
Pacific Railroad, which was boosting tourism in national parks. It burned four 
years later, but the present structure is faithful to the original's "Early 
National Park" architecture, including rough-hewn limestone walls and 
high-timbered ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the lodge is Bright Angel Point, with its famous view of the Deva, 
Brahma and Zoroaster temples. These are the buttes engraved on a two-cent U.S. 
postage stamp issued in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching the bottom of the canyon, riders dismount for a picnic lunch. At this 
point, some tenderfoots may have begun to feel tender in other spots. A dip in 
the swirling waters of Roaring Springs cascade is numbing. This sparkling clear 
spring is the water source for the entire park. 
</P>
<P>
By the return climb, the mules seem like guardian angels, even as they nose out 
over the brink for frequent rest stops -- "so they can see where their front 
feet are." Their routine is one-speed all the way, a steady trudge toward an 
alfalfa supper back at the stable. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclist looked forward to something more soothing. He had to get back on 
his two-wheeler the next day.

Las Vegas and Phoenix, both of which are served by most major U.S. airlines. 
Train service is available to the South Rim from Williams, and bus service from 
Flagstaff and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: To avoid the heaviest crowds, the first choice would be the 
North Rim: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grand Canyon Lodge: About 280 rustic cabins are clustered around a gorgeous 
old lodge. Two-person cabins cost $45 to $60 a night. For reservations, contact 
TW Recreational Services, P.O. Box 400, Cedar City, Utah 84720, (801) 586-7686. 
</P>
<P>

are in 24 small cabins. Rates for two: $40-$55 a night. For reservations: (800) 
525-0924. 
</P>
<P>
There's no escaping the crowds at Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim. Still, 
it is a jumping-off place for rim and inner-canyon hikes: 
</P>

<P>
Getting there: Japan Air Lines flies daily from Los Angeles to Tokyo. The 
round-trip coach fare is $1,748. 
</P>
<P>
From Tokyo, the fastest way to get to Miyajima is to hop on the Shinkansen 
Bullet Train. 
</P>
<P>
Trains depart Tokyo Station for Hiroshima several times an hour for the 4 
1/2-hour trip. The one-way economy fare is about $133, and the one-way 
first-class fare is about $184. 
</P>
<P>
From Hiroshima, take the train from the Hiroshima Station to the Miyajima-Guchi 
Station, a 25-minute trip. Cost is $2.90. From the Miyajima-Guchi Station, it 
is only a two-minute, well-marked walk to the Miyajima ferry, which departs 
frequently on the 10-minute trip to the island. Cost is $1.30. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: Deluxe accommodations in Hiroshima include the Hiroshima Grand 
Hotel (telephone: 011-81-82-227-1313 or fax: 011-81-82-227-6462), with doubles 
from $150 including tax. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate accommodations in a typical Japanese-style inn are available at the 
Minshuku Ikedaya, from $45 double. Call 011-81-82-231-3329. 
</P>
<P>
Not all inns in Japan accept foreign travelers, so it's wise to check in 
advance. The Kamefuku Inn accepts international visitors, but as with all 
Japanese-style inns, this could change. The rate at the Kamefuku, a lovely 
little country hotel, starts at $225 plus tax for two people, including meals. 
Call 011-81-82-944-2111.

HEALTH FOOD SAMPLES LOADED WITH PESTICIDE RESIDUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Health foods contain more pesticide residues than any other foods tested by the 
Ministry of Agriculture, the ministry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a sampling of food available in health food stores and supermarkets, the 
Ministry of Agriculture found that 60% of nuts, beans, seeds and legumes 
contained traces of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
About half, or 51%, of the dried and semi-dried fruit contained pesticide 
traces, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The health foods sampled were not organically grown and many were imported, 
said Ministry of Agriculture spokeswoman, Christine Jude. 
</P>
<P>
"With health foods like nuts, pastas and seeds, they are mainly non-U.K. 
produced and in many cases they have quite a long journey," she said. "They are 
fumigated to prevent them from rotting or becoming pest-infected." 
</P>
<P>
The lowest level of pesticide residue was found in fresh fruits and vegetables 
from regular grocery stores, which showed 20% containing traces of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide traces found in the health foods were well within maximum residue 
levels set by the government, Jude said. Of 4,000 food samples, 64% contained 
no detectable traces of pesticides, the ministry said.

ORAL HISTORY KITS TAP FAILING MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL C. BUELOW, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MADISON, Wis. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A swatch of denim, a cowbell or a circus poster may be all it takes to prompt 
memories that preserve the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It's talking about life. Memories need to be shared, whether good or bad, and 
we should listen to what (elderly) people have to say and why it's important," 
said Kathryn Leide, who with her partner has developed kits intended to stir up 
the past and stir the recollections of older men and women. 
</P>
<P>
The kits cover such themes as county fairs, the Depression, the home front, 
farm days, school days, work life, train rides and aprons. 
</P>
<P>
The kits, described as a multisensory, multimedia approach to reaching the 
elderly and others, contain videotape cassettes, slides, song books, fabrics, 
scent cards and items such as rationing stamps, sports pennants, old train 
schedules and circus posters. 
</P>
<P>
Leide and Lynne Erickson organized their nonprofit corporation, Bi-Folkal 
Productions Inc. of Madison, about 14 years ago. They sell or rent about 
$300,000 worth of kits a year. 
</P>
<P>
They first sold the kits to libraries, then expanded to nursing homes, prisons, 
colleges, state hospitals and day-care centers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never not had a lot of reaction from their material," said Lethene Parks, 
a former librarian for the Washington State Library who has used the kits in 
workshops in mental hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation blossomed from a college library services class project. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that standard book talk didn't do enough for older adults," Leide 
said. "The multisensory approach, using things they can see, smell and touch, 
takes into account their physical limitations." 
</P>
<P>
Once at a Maryland nursing home a pair of older men who rarely spoke to anyone 
got into a heated argument about unionism in the 1940s after a group session 
using one of the kits, Leide recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"They were actually yelling at each other. We were surprised and apologized to 
the project coordinator, but she thought the reaction was wonderful, to see 
they still had feelings that strong and opened up was good," Leide said. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Erickson said she was told a man in a wheelchair got up 
and started dancing the Charleston. When nursing home officials reacted with 
surprise that he could even walk, he responded, "I can, I just never had a 
reason to before." 
</P>
<P>
The women said their product evokes sad as well as happy memories. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, there are many tears. The 'Farm Days' kit deals with the family farm when 
these people were young, and many people lost the family farm back then," Leide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We included the Depression as a kit because we found so many older people use 
it as a benchmark when they try to remember something that happened in their 
lives," Erickson said.

MARKETS / JOHN CRUDELE: MOST TRADERS INVEST OWN MONEY CAUTIOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Sure I'll tell you how I'm investing my own money," said a stock trader who 
works at a mid-sized brokerage firm. "But you can't use my name because I'm 
investing a lot more conservatively than my clients, and they'll give me 
grief." 
</P>
<P>
Once a year I take a small sampling of how some Wall Street pros are putting 
their own money to work. Typically, the folks closest to the stock and bond 
markets invest more cautiously than you might expect. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts say it is because they can't monitor their own investments as 
carefully as they do their clients'. Others admit privately that, even when 
optimistic predictions about the markets are coming out of their firms, they 
prefer to remain extra careful. This is their own money, after all. 
</P>
<P>
With stock prices sinking steadily the past several months and interest rates 
rising, the pros this year seem to be investing their own dough more carefully 
than ever. Like the average small investor, the experts are looking to put the 
bulk of their assets safely away, while keeping a small amount of "mad money" 
for stocks or other investments that could hit the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what some of the pros are doing: 
</P>
<P>
* Kim Rupert, a vice president at MMS International who's in charge of keeping 
an eye on what the Federal Reserve is doing, is investing as if interest rates 
aren't going much higher. 
</P>
<P>
Rupert says she has 35% of her own money in long-term zero coupon Treasury 
bonds and 65% in money market funds. A zero coupon Treasury bond is a note that 
pays no interest but sells well below its face value. It attracts investors 
with tax-sheltered income and long-term objectives. "The zero coupons are 
pretty cheap nowadays, and I'm planning ahead for the next few years," says 
Rupert, adding that "I like the over 9%" yields. 
</P>
<P>
While she believes that interest rates could go up slightly from current 
levels, she doesn't think that the increase will be so large that she'll regret 
having locked up the 35% in zeros. Besides, she says, the 65% of her money 
allocated to money market funds could quickly be shifted to long-term bonds if 
rates do climb substantially. 
</P>
<P>
* Hildegard Zagorski, a stock market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities, 
says she is "not doing very much in the market." Zagorski says that aside from 
buying an option on a gold stock a few weeks ago -- as a play on inflation -- 
she's kept her money invested cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely conservative," says Zagorski, who added that this is just her 
nature and not a reflection on the current market. "I don't fool around with 
stocks." 
</P>
<P>
Money that Zagorski has invested in a 401(k) retirement plan and an individual 
retirement account is being put to work in a money market fund and a Treasury 
bond fund. The 401(k) and the IRA are tax-sheltered savings plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nibbling (on stocks), but not going wild," says Hugh Johnson, chief market 
strategist for First Albany Corp. "I think the market is going to go down. But 
I'm starting to see some values." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says he's buying mainly blue chip stocks like AT&amp;T and Philip 
Morris. But primarily, he says, he's investing in his own company, First 
Albany. 
</P>
<P>
By nibbling on blue chips and investing in First Albany, Johnson has tied up 
about 75% of the money he has available. The remaining 25% is being invested in 
Treasury, zero or municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't really done anything differently" since the financial markets 
started to decline, Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
* Oppenheimer &amp; Co.'s market watcher, Michael Metz, is using a different 
approach than Johnson. "Right now I'm looking for bargains in the 
small-capitalization area," says Metz. Small stocks, he says, have been 
under-performing the rest of the stock market. And some are selling at 
"going-out-of-business prices" -- even though they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
But Metz says he is putting only 30% of his money in stocks right now. The rest 
is invested in Treasury securities with maturities of four to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Metz believes that the stock market as a whole will be stuck in a trading 
range, with the Dow Jones industrial average going no higher than 2,900 and no 
lower than 2,400. Small stocks will stage a better recovery than big ones, he 
contends, when oil prices and inflation come down next year. 
</P>
<P>
The small stocks that Metz likes include Tech-Sym Corp. of Houston, Storage 
Equities Inc. of Glendale and Vitalink Communications of Fremont, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
* Liam Dalton, who runs the money management firm of Axiom Partners in New 
York, is the boldest of the group sampled. And he has only 55% of his total 
assets (not just his "investable assets") in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Over the short term, Dalton says there is a better chance that stocks will rise 
than fall. Any good news out of the Middle East would be like tossing a match 
on a pile of dry wood, igniting a rally, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Dalton admits, in the current environment "you wake up every day, and 
you take a look at where everything is." He thinks that if war starts in the 
Middle East, it would knock the stock market down for a time, then permit it to 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
But even Dalton is investing selectively. "I'm looking to pick off some of the 
less vulnerable stocks," he says. Cooper Tire, for instance, should have good 
earnings. More importantly, says Dalton, the stock is depressed. He also likes 
Kuhlman Corp., a Birmingham, Mich., maker of plastic products. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton says 35% of his assets are in bonds and the rest in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Now for my secretive trader friend who didn't want his identity revealed. 
</P>
<P>
He's keeping 60% of his investments in money market funds and 40% in stocks. 
"I've always liked cash on hand. You never know when you'll need it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"In stocks, I try to pick out large stocks with recognizable brands" -- like 
AT&amp;T, Mobil and Hershey. "The only way you make money is over the long 
term." 
</P>
<P>
He does have some mad money. He sets $10,000 to $15,000 aside to speculate on 
the short-term ups and downs of certain stocks, "just to play, just to keep 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
And probably so his clients won't think he's a coward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
104 Hours' Work Goes to Pay the Mortgage 
</P>
<P>
If you can't figure out yet why the housing market is in such tough shape, 
here's as good an explanation as any. 
</P>
<P>
Comstock Partners, an investment advisory firm, says the average factory worker 
has to use up 104.15 hours of wages a month to pay the mortgage on an 
average-priced house. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage payments were sopping up 101.17 hours of monthly pay in 1989 and 99.54 
hours in 1988. Since the normal person probably works less than 160 hours a 
month, this doesn't leave much left for extravagances -- like food. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1963, Comstock says, people had to fork over only 36.46 hours of 
monthly wages to make a mortgage payment. 
</P>
<P>
But today's situation isn't the worst ever. In 1981, when interest rates went 
into the stratosphere, it took 113.88 hours of work to service a monthly 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Comstock was one of the first groups to predict that housing prices 
would tumble. It doesn't hold out a lot of hope for the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
To afford a house, "most people had to put two people to work -- at least -- in 
the 1980s," according to Rita Hamilton, an investment analyst with Comstock. 
"That's still the case with the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Housing prices in many regions of the country have fallen the past few years, 
which has helped the situation somewhat. But the improvement in affordability 
on the price side has been partly wiped out by an increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Could anything revive the housing market? Hamilton says a large jump in wages 
would help. But that's unlikely to occur, especially if the nation enters a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
A big drop in interest rates would make houses more affordable. But Hamilton 
believes that there won't be a major pickup in demand unless mortgage rates 
fall to between 6% and 7%. And Comstock thinks that, over the near term, rates 
will be rising. 
</P>
<P>
The last alternative is not a pretty one. Prices will have to fall more before 
sales pick up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time May Be Right for Collection Firms' Stock 
</P>
<P>
Union Corp. and Payco America are in the perfect business for today's economic 
environment. Both firms make a living collecting bad debts for other people. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Carabell, an analyst with Kemper's Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi brokerage, 
says when the economy starts to sour, delinquent borrowers often can't pay off 
all their loans, so "it becomes a question of who gets there first." Union 
Corp. and Payco are hired by creditors who want to be first in line. 
</P>
<P>
There are said to be 6,000 companies and people throughout America who get paid 
for collecting bad debts. And while most of the knee-breakers are out of this 
business, the majority of these 6,000 are small, mom-and-pop operations. The 
exceptions are Union Corp., Payco and a Canadian company called FCA Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The collectors generally send letters to debtors and pepper them with telephone 
calls. They can also garnish debtors' wages or haul them into court. For their 
effort, collection firms generally get to keep between 25% and 35% of what they 
collect. They have a success rate of about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Cooper, head of Union Corp., doesn't see the economic downturn as a boon 
to his business. He says there is already $90 billion in bad debts out there, 
so there is plenty of "inventory" for businesses like his. 
</P>
<P>
But others like Carabell think that the economic slump -- let's go ahead and 
call it a recession -- will make the earnings of publicly held debt collection 
firms go up. In fact, he believes, Union Corp.'s $20 stock could be selling for 
$35 a share before it gets sidetracked by an economic upturn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congress May Be Able to Skirt Spending Law 
</P>
<P>
If Congress can delay for another month, it might not have to worry about Gramm 
Rudman after all. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department last week gave Congress the perfect escape route from 
making Gramm Rudman spending cuts when it reported that the nation's gross 
national product had risen only 0.4% in the second quarter. Previously it had 
reported growth of 1.2% for that quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Under a little-understood provision of Gramm Rudman, Congress can vote to 
suspend the deficit reduction law under a handful of circumstances. One is 
economic growth of less than 1% in two consecutive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department makes its first report on the third-quarter gross 
national product on Oct. 31. Most experts agree that third-quarter business 
growth should be considerably below 1%. 
</P>
<P>
So if Congress hasn't come to a deficit reduction by Oct. 31, it can simply 
vote to suspend Gramm Rudman -- for the good of the economy, of course. 
</P>
<P>
One other way to suspend Gramm Rudman would be to declare war on somebody.

IF THE JAPANESE CAN OVERCOME WW II ENMITY, SURELY AMERICAN FIRMS CAN SUCCEED IN 
ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan's article "Asia Beckons as a Land of Vast Opportunity" (Sept. 
12, 1990) was a well-done piece on the Asia Pacific market. I recently spent 
three weeks visiting Singapore and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
In both countries I was impressed by the American presence in music, clothes 
and food. Every hotel we visited had an "American buffet breakfast." I was 
disappointed, however, to see how completely the automobile market was 
dominated by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
In many hotels the elevators were Hitachi, as was the moveable sidewalk in the 
Singapore airport. It occurred to me that the Japanese must have overcome 
enormous buyer resistance in those two countries, where people have memories of 
the World War II Japanese occupation. I think the American auto makers really 
missed the boat by failing to develop these markets. 
</P>
<P>
It may be too late for car makers, but other industries should be prepared to 
develop markets, particularly in Indonesia, whose next census should report a 
population in excess of 180 million. While in that country I visited high 
schools in Java and Sumatra and met administrators, teachers and hundreds of 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesian students, from grades seven through 12, study English and are 
fascinated with California. I got the sense that they almost see it as a land 
unto itself. I'm convinced that an aggressive marketing campaign by 
California-based companies could produce substantial dividends in a very short 
period.

EVEN HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL HAS A DOWNSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. EWING, DAVID W. EWING, who served on the Harvard Business School 
faculty for nearly 40 years, is author of the new book, Inside the Harvard 
Business School. He now is a full-time writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Harvard Business School, with its elegant 61-acre campus and 55,000 
graduates, has been dubbed the "cathedral of management" and the "West Point of 
capitalism." People with MBAs from Harvard are in the news every day, and in 
business and government they wield enormous power. At a time when industry is 
striving for excellence, the B school stresses higher standards of "quality 
control" in teaching than almost any other educational institution in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most other schools, moreover, the B school is affluent. Every year, many 
millions of dollars come from alums to swell a burgeoning endowment. With more 
than two dozen buildings already in use and a new $20-million recreation 
facility just completed, the administration is hungry for more. It now hopes to 
build soon an exquisite chapel on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Students learn many ideas and techniques that help them enormously after 
graduation. They learn the need to make decisions with imperfect information, 
ways to cope with stress, the danger of perfectionism, the importance of 
setting priorities, techniques of digging for facts and numerous other 
approaches. Currently, they are developing an ethical awareness, with the help 
of new cases, that few students learn elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, therefore, criticizing the B school is like criticizing 
motherhood or baseball -- it just isn't done, especially by an insider. 
However, there are valid criticisms of the B school, and they should be kept in 
mind by a discerning public. At the cost of inflaming many valued colleagues 
and friends made during my many years at the school, let me mention the main 
criticisms as I see them: 
</P>
<P>
* Arrogance and elitism. The B school tends to breed an attitude in students, 
graduates and teachers that they are superior human beings. Sometimes the 
symptoms are subtle: a self-satisfied smile; a bloated feeling that "I deserve 
everything I've got;" a little too much haste in identifying with the B school 
in outside activities; avoiding contacts with manual and clerical workers as if 
they weren't important, and so on. Sometimes the symptoms are not so subtle. 
One time in a public place I heard someone boast, "My dear man, of course I 
know what I'm talking about. I graduated from the Harvard Business School." 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, this sense of elitism is useful. It helps fund-raisers, it 
enables students to survive the relentless demands of the first year, it 
bolsters the faculty's esprit de corps. In the long run, however, elitism is 
costly, turning many non-B-school people off and breeding resentment. 
</P>
<P>
* Materialism. Few MBAs at Harvard pay much attention to the apostle Paul's 
observation that "the love of money is the root of all evil things." The 
almighty dollar reigns supreme on campus; bottom-line thinking is obsessive. 
While the faculty often reminds students that other things are important too, 
money comes first, in and out of class. 
</P>
<P>
In the white-pillared library, which reputedly houses more business material 
than any other library in the world, the bust of mogul Henry Clay Frick glowers 
at passersby, silently measuring their financial importance. The main buildings 
at the school are named after financial tycoons. At graduation time, many MBAs 
observe the longstanding custom of waving dollar bills. 
</P>
<P>
The school takes pride in the high starting salaries of graduates, which now 
average more than $60,000 a year. Many offices and buildings focus on fund 
raising, job placement and other financial activities. During crucial parts of 
the year, in fact, the B school resembles a huge executive placement agency, 
with corporate recruiters interviewing students, lunching in the faculty club 
and bustling about. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the money obsessions that many students bring to the school are 
fortified when they go back to industry. They view employees as a cost to be 
minimized. They see judges and prosecutors in the court system as people to be 
bought, if necessary. They strive for opulent salaries and homes. Their 
attitudes rub against the grain of many people, and from time to time an angry 
public exacts harsh curbs. 
</P>
<P>
* Obnoxious graduates. Somewhere between 10% and 15% of a normal class 
graduating from the school are neurotic dingbats, loudmouths, conceited nerds, 
abrasive jerks. Perhaps almost any group anywhere has a similar percentage of 
obnoxious people, but if they are B-school grads, they have high visibility and 
therefore are more annoying. 
</P>
<P>
To their credit, the majority of B-schoolers try to discipline the obnoxious 
ones in their midst. Sometimes they do this effectively. One alum I know feels 
that the most valuable thing he took away from B school was not knowledge or 
skill but self-discovery. "I was tactless," he said. "I came on much too 
strong, and many let me know it. I learned in Boston that I have to watch 
myself constantly." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, most obnoxious students become obnoxious grads; the leopard 
doesn't change its spots. 
</P>
<P>
* The B school's view of the world. While all cases taught come from industry 
or government, the decisions about what cases are needed in a course come from 
the faculty -- and not all professors are unbiased. Some have a personal ax to 
grind; many are more interested in didactic qualities than in realism; most are 
prejudiced by personal experiences. Out of the formidable series of cases 
discussed in class -- about 400 per year -- comes a picture of the economic 
world that doesn't always jibe with reality. 
</P>
<P>
For example, although countless cases point to the irrationality of behavior in 
organizations, this quality may be treated in class as an anomaly. The implicit 
message is that decision makers -- Harvard Business School decision makers, 
anyway -- can be rational if they try hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
Little attention is given to the possibility that underneath the facile minds 
of the best MBAs lurk quixotic crosscurrents and, sometimes, emotional snake 
pits. A powerful vice president has an ingrained bias against handicapped 
people; a negotiator is driven by an inferiority complex. Often such decision 
makers rationalize their actions using techniques from the B school to do so, 
but that does not change the fact. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the B school emphasizes decision making. Students are likely to go away 
thinking that most of an executive's time is devoted to deciding this problem 
or that question. In reality, however, decision making usually consumes but a 
portion of an executive's time and energy, while most of the day is spent on 
implementing decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Many astute students know that such pictures of the world are skewed. To many, 
however, the reality comes as a jolt after playing the game so long and 
intensively in class. 
</P>
<P>
The B school is an extraordinary place. It has momentum, money and visibility. 
Its students represent the cream of the crop, its campus is elegant, its cases 
and case-method teaching are the best. 
</P>
<P>
No one should think for a minute, however, that the B school is the last word 
in management education. It is not. Somewhere down the road lies an institution 
that will improve on Harvard's way of teaching future managers.

FULL U.S. DEREGULATION WOULD KILL BANKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is remarkable how a supposedly learned economist such as Allan H. Meltzer 
can be so ignorant of history in his "Deposit Insurance System Was Culprit in 
S&amp;L Mess" (Sept. 16). 
</P>
<P>
To jolt Meltzer's faltering memory: In 1932 a series of bank failures prompted 
a run on the banks by depositors who feared losing their life savings. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a bank moratorium and 
the banks were closed until the panic was over. Deposit insurance was enacted 
to guarantee deposits in an effort to avoid similar panic situations in the 
future. The bank failures were caused by mounting losses in the bloated values 
of bank assets because of wide speculation before the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s has been a period of rising speculation, with inflationary real 
estate values, equities and the like, accompanied by a tide of mergers financed 
by high-risk, high-interest junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The emerging economic downturn is bursting the bubble of speculation and the 
destruction of capital is progressing from one region of the country to 
another. The relaxation of banking industry regulation and the cuts in 
regulatory staff during the Reagan Administration has intensified the debacle, 
permitting fraud and high risk ventures that could have been controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Meltzer points to "administrative failure, regulatory failure, failure of 
congressional oversight and . . . flawed institutions." Yet he would eliminate 
regulatory oversight and do away with deposit insurance, which would return us 
to 1932 when millions lost their savings. Eliminating deposit insurance would 
result in a mass exodus from the banking system and depositors would put their 
money where they feel it will be more secure. Meltzer's proposals would 
guarantee the destruction of the banking system.

MORE WASPS IN THE IVY; 
</P>
<P>
THE LADY OF SITUATIONS BY LOUIS AUCHINCLOSS (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $20.95; 275 PP.; 
0-395-54411-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Anne Dolan, Dolan, formerly editor of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, 
is a free-lance writer and film producer based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Hill, he of the "romantic good looks, with very pale skin and lustrous 
raven hair" and "moist brown eyes," was having a discussion with his siblings 
about his mother's love for his father. 
</P>
<P>
"And looking at his sisters, he wondered if indeed any woman was capable of a 
great passion. Was that why Averhill had seemed to him such a citadel of 
romantic feeling? Precisely because it was a male monastery?" 
</P>
<P>
Such is the stuff of "The Lady of Situations," another in the long line of 
boys'-prep-school-as-male-monastery stories brought to us by the popular 
author, Louis Auchincloss. 
</P>
<P>
This saga is a romantic yarn set in the '30s and '40s about a socially striving 
poor girl, Natica Chauncey, who grows up on the wrong side of a rich New 
England community and sets her angry sights on conquering the white-columned 
Averhill boys school in order to retrieve her Depression-ruined family 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of upper-crust scenario that has made Auchincloss a minor icon 
among prolific fiction writers, a man lionized at New York social functions for 
his 40-odd works that often are set on the shelf next to Wharton, Marquand and 
O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
One should pay attention to a new Auchincloss, for he has proved his literary 
merit in the past. But "The Lady of Situations" is still another portrait of 
the basically unsullied WASP world where its author (a Groton and Yale 
graduate) chooses to linger. It is an arcane universe where the worst that 
happens is a bit of polite adultery rocking the walls of the "monastery," plus 
some milder breaches of honor. 
</P>
<P>
Characters speak operatically. Aunt Ruth, for example, describes how a group of 
mean boys are treating dear little Natica in the dining room at a fancy party: 
"I had a horrid fantasy that I should soon be hearing, as in the second act of 
Tosca, the cries from the offstage torture chamber." You get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Even if one embraced the fashion these days for non-involved "fun reading," and 
decided to stretch out by the fire to engage in mindless pleasure, it simply 
cannot be ignored that this kind of work is shockingly outpaced by some truly 
intriguing current social essayists. 
</P>
<P>
If you must look at upper-class private-school life, wouldn't you turn to 
film-maker Whit Stillman's new portrait of Park Avenue preppies in 
"Metropolitan"? Or watch "Dead Poet's Society" again? 
</P>
<P>
Or pick up Robert Sam Anson's riveting nonfiction look at the racial horrors at 
Andover? Or, for an earlier setting, re-read John Gunther's moving story about 
headmaster Frank Boyden and life at Deerfield Academy, the graceful "Death Be 
Not Proud"? 
</P>
<P>
There's something vainglorious about struggling to keep the traditional novel 
of manners alive in the style of William Dean Howells or Henry James at a time 
when men's clubs and men's schools and ladies' clubs and schools are co-ed and 
diverse, making prissy Turn-of-the-Century manners so uninteresting. With 
ethical and moral struggles presented by AIDS, drugs, racial tensions and 
modern greed, more vivid tales are available. 
</P>
<P>
If Howells were alive today, he would be down at some public high school in the 
South Bronx trying to beat Tom Wolfe out of the real story. 
</P>
<P>
It is no doubt Auchincloss' fond hope that his work bridges time and that his 
treatments of love, sex, religion, philosophy and the struggle to hold a moral 
standard against the pressures of modernity holds up as a contemporary morality 
play. Indeed, he pretty much managed this Jamesian feat once, in his 1964 work, 
"The Rector of Justin." But, in "The Lady of Situations," a startlingly similar 
story, he did not. 
</P>
<P>
The books have virtually the same story line. The hero in the first (Brian 
Aspinwall) enters life on the prep school campus (Justin), idolizes the 
headmaster (the rector) only to doubt him and consequently resolve his doubt by 
returning to school and the glorious chore of writing his hero's biography. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Lady of Situations," our heroine marries into life on the campus of a 
prep school she idealizes, becomes disenchanted, leaves, becomes a lawyer with 
a rich husband and then sends her children to the fancy prep school, thus 
demonstrating to the world her glorious end. In "Rector," there was the central 
character of a headmaster, Frank Prescott. "Lady" is built around the dominant, 
legendary headmaster, Rufus Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
In each, there are young and virtuous teaching masters. Each has at least one 
beautiful, willful young woman who is smarter than the men to whom she is 
subservient, a fact silently recognized by the aforementioned all-seeing Head. 
</P>
<P>
Both books are structured as memoirs: "Rector" the shuffled journals of Brian 
and "Lady" the memoirs of dear and hearty Aunt Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Disavow yourself of the notion that this "Lady's" version is differentiated in 
any significant way by its attempts to spotlight women. While the heroine does 
magically become a lawyer virtually overnight in the late 1940s, and does 
subsequently find herself preparing the brief for a case involving separate but 
equal schools, this is no feminist work. Natica Chauncey sees herself as a 
Bronte sister, "without the moors and without the genius." She is clever in 
that standard all-women-are-connivers way. Like other females in the book, she 
marries her way to the top, which takes her three tries. 
</P>
<P>
The other female characters hardly fill out the picture. There are the 
requisite eccentrics, old bats with pretensions, like Estelle Knight, who would 
have been "the divine Sarah" had she had a choice but writes poetry and 
smuggles jewels instead. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, "Lady" is another male-monastery book, and one cannot help wondering 
about the repetition of "Rector," which was a complex, subtle and well-written 
variation on the theme. The answer perhaps can be found back in the earlier 
work, where Cordelia, the rector's daughter, wonders why Brian Aspinwall would 
take the time to write a book about his headmaster. She refers Brian to her 
shrink: "Perhaps you have what Dr. Klaus calls 'Peter Panic.' You want to be a 
schoolboy again."

BOUNCING BACK; HOW A HEROIC BAND OF POW'S SURVIVED VIETNAM BY GEOFFREY NORMAN 
(HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95; 256 PP.; 0-395-45186-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Winston Groom, Groom is the author of six novels and a Vietnam POW book, 
Conversations With the Enemy, which was nominated for the 1984 Pulitizer Prize. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was ironic that Al Stafford wasn't supposed to fly the bombing mission at 
all that morning. He was just a backup, waiting in the flight line aboard the 
carrier USS Oriskany in case one of the other A-4 jet bombers malfunctioned on 
that hot summer day in 1967. Sure enough, one did. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Lt. Cmdr. Stafford was airborne, streaking across the South 
China Sea toward the coast of North Vietnam where his air group had been 
assigned to destroy a military bridge used to transport arms and men into South 
Vietnam. As the formation neared the target, Stafford's missile-warning device 
buzzed. From the cockpit he could see the giant SAM Russian missiles roaring 
toward and past him, looking for all the world like giant flying telephone 
poles. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly there was a horrific explosion as a 300-pound SAM warhead exploded 
just behind his cockpit, igniting the four tons of bombs he was carrying, as 
well as his fuel tanks. The plane literally disintegrated in midair. 
</P>
<P>
By all rights, Stafford should have been dead, but somehow the automatic seat 
ejector had been set off and he awakened floating gently down toward the lush 
but hostile greenery of the Vietnamese countryside. His flight suit was on 
fire; his arm was broken, as well as several ribs, and a shoulder was 
separated. He was bleeding heavily from head wounds. But he was alive, a 
condition which, very soon, even he would come to regret. 
</P>
<P>
Stafford was quickly captured and force-marched in his condition several miles 
to an interrogation center, where he was immediately beaten, tortured, starved 
and jammed upside down for 24 hours into a sewer pipe set in the ground -- all 
because he would not reveal the name of his ship. In those days, that was 
standard treatment for captured pilots, and virtually all of them, Stafford 
included, broke under the pressure -- to one degree or another. 
</P>
<P>
"Bouncing Back" is the story of Stafford and many of his comrades who spent up 
to six years in the grisly dungeons the North Vietnamese called "prison camps." 
It is the story of how they coped during those awful times, and it recalls such 
works as "King Rat," "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and "Papillon." "Bounce 
Back" was the phrase the men used to describe their recovery from the 
consistent torture their captors inflicted to exploit the POWs for propaganda 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
It also is the story of their return and how now, 20 years later, they have 
"bounced back" into a society from which they were so long removed. 
</P>
<P>
Maltreatment of American prisoners at the hands of the North Vietnamese has 
been chronicled before, mostly in autobiographies, but the author of this book 
probably does more justice to the subject than most, having solicited 
information from a wider body of sources and subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment of U.S. war prisoners, even by the Nazis, pales by what is described 
here: constant slow starvation, isolation, vermin, exposure, beatings, little 
or no medical treatment and the frequent use of medieval-style engines of 
torture. Only the Japanese barbarism toward POWs in World War II or some of the 
bizarre goings-on in northern China toward the end of the last century come 
close by comparison. How these men persevered is remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
Use of the POWs for propaganda purposes was a common tactic. "Confessions" 
needed to be signed; appearences were demanded at "press conferences" to 
repudiate American policy. The POWs drew up their own set of rules for these 
occasions, since it was obvious no man could withstand the consequences if he 
followed to the letter the official U.S. Armed Forces Code of Conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Most, though not all, initially refused and let themselves be subjected to 
torture first, but when the torture became too great they would give in. 
Stafford, for instance, was strung up, whipped, beaten and kicked for hours on 
end before he consented to tape a "confession" and have it played before a 
crowd of journalists, including a photographer for Life magazine. Even so, he 
managed to betray his captors by bowing stiffly four times like some character 
out of "The Manchurian Candidate," so that the Americans, at least, could tell 
the statements were coerced. Then he went back to his cell to begin the process 
of "bouncing back." 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners devised an elaborate code and message system, which has been 
described by others but is an integral part of this book. Much of their time 
was devoted to this endeavor, since communication of any sort was so important. 
Reduced to pitiable, malnourished wretches, most survivors managed mainly 
because of this code and the consequent ability of senior officers to command, 
to keep the faith. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the war, when the treatment eased somewhat and the POWs were 
allowed to mingle, the men bucked up their spirits by organizing classes for 
each other, each man teaching his specialty, whether engineering, cooking, 
literature, mechanics or gardening. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the POWs were released and each man faced a different sort of crisis. 
Some wives had filed for divorce -- one on grounds of desertion. Relationships 
had to be renewed; infant children were now half-grown. Some POWs, so badly 
injured they no longer could fly, faced an uncertain job market years behind 
their peers. Stafford, for instance, learned that his wife had moved to Hong 
Kong and did not much desire to return to America. 
</P>
<P>
But one lesson the ordeal in prison had taught most of them was that they could 
Bounce Back. A study conducted by the military indicated that 15 years after 
their release, there were no long-term psychological problems. While there was 
one suicide, and others suffered bouts of depression for a while, all in all 
they proved incredibly resilient. 
</P>
<P>
Stafford himself stayed in the service and ultimately took command of the Navy 
survival school in Pensacola, Fla. The concept of Bouncing Back was 
incorporated into the program with great success.

As Hernan Cortes' small army neared the Aztecan capital of Tenochtitlan in 
1519, they arrived at Iztapalapa, a hilltop village that gave the Spaniards 
their first panoramic view of the sprawling New World metropolis in the valley 
of Mexico. Cortes and his men numbered only 400. The city was the seat of the 
expansive Aztec empire, and had a population of a half million. 
</P>
<P>
As one chronicler in Cortes' band described it, "We saw so many cities and 
villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land . . . we were 
amazed and said that it was like the enchantments they tell of in the legend of 
Amadis, on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the 
water . . . And some of our soldiers asked whether the things that we saw were 
not a dream . . . all was cemented and very splendid with many kinds of stone 
monuments with pictures on them, which gave much to think about." 
</P>
<P>
It is in such moments of confounded awe -- on the eve of great destruction -- 
that Mexican art, as we know it, had its ambiguous birth. For finally, the 
conquest of Mexico was as much a triumph of the eye as it was a victory of the 
sword and gun. 
</P>
<P>
For many years to come, the conquistadores' way of seeing the world would be 
the only true one, and they quickly set about remaking much of the fantastic, 
alien world they encountered in their own image, as a "New Spain." 
</P>
<P>
The chronicler, writing 30 years after the events, concludes his account of the 
dazzling first sight of Tenochtitlan by noting that, "Of all these wonders that 
I then beheld today all is overthrown and lost, nothing left standing." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 471 years later, at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
preparations are nearly complete for a new Mexican conquest. Opening Oct. 10 is 
"Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries," the most significant exhibition of art 
from Mexico to appear in New York in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
From New York City, the nearly 400 objects in the show will later travel 
exclusively to the two Chicano capitals of Mexamerica, appearing first at the 
San Antonio Museum of Art (April 6-Aug. 4, 1991), and then at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art (Sept. 29-Dec. 29, 1991). For Los Angeles, it will be the 
most important public presentation of Mexican art since the 1978 "Treasures of 
Mexico" show, sponsored by the Armand Hammer Foundation at the County Museum. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted "Twenty Centuries of 
Mexican Art," the first major exhibition of its kind to be shown in the United 
States (see accompanying story). And in 1970, the Metropolitan Museum hosted 
"Before Cortes," an historic show of the pre-Columbian sculpture of 
Mesoamerica. 
</P>
<P>
But the Met show is perhaps the most comprehensive collection of ancient, 
colonial and modern Mexican artistry ever assembled in the United States. In 
scale, it is the largest show the museum has presented since "The Vatican 
Collection: The Papacy and Art" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, designers, lighting engineers, and workmen at the Metropolitan 
Museum are finishing the specially constructed, maze-like exhibition gallery as 
some of the pieces are being installed. 
</P>
<P>
According to the show's four co-curators, all members of the museum staff, 
featured works include Mayan and Aztecan sculptures, early post-conquest 
manuscripts, popular religious and devotional objects, costumes, graphics, and 
paintings, ranging in date of origin from 1000 BC to AD 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Amassing such an enormous grouping of objects is a logistics triumph that has 
been three years in the making, with pieces drawn from 41 public and 24 private 
collections in Mexico, the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The principal financial supporter of the multi-million dollar event is a newly 
formed, Los Angeles-based foundation, "Friends of the Arts of Mexico," which in 
turn is the brainchild of Emilio Azcarraga, the chairman of Mexico's Televisa 
network. In 1987, Azcarraga approached Philippe de Montebello, director of the 
Metropolitan Museum, with the idea for a comprehensive show of Mexican art. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" is its most high-profile 
undertaking to date, the organization -- which has a mandate to promote 
appreciation of Mexico's artistic and cultural heritage in this country -- has 
already sponsored a touring exhibition of work by young Mexican artists, as 
well as efforts to preserve the Rock Art of Baja California and the David 
Alfaro Siquieros "America Tropical" mural on Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
John McDonald, exhibition coordinator of the Metropolitan show, and curator for 
the 19th-Century section, modestly sums up the collection that has been 
gathered for the October opening in New York City as "more than a roundup of 
the usual suspects." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do a comprehensive exhibition. With 50 years since the last major 
show, it was long enough for people to forget, for generations to come and go 
and not have a chance to see this work. It will be an eye-opener for a New York 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
As befits an imperial exhibition of this sort, the scope of cultural periods 
and styles to be represented in the show is impressive, offering the North 
American public a rare opportunity to see under one roof a spectrum of Mexican 
artistic expression that would be difficult to match in weeks of museum touring 
in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the pre-Hispanic section, which will comprise one-third of the 
exhibition, will be one of the colossal stone heads of the Olmec people, who 
came before the more familiar Mayan and Aztecan civilizations. The giant heads, 
discovered in La Venta and San Lorenzo, Tabasco on the Gulf Coast beginning in 
the 1920s, depict faces that appear distinctly Negroid and have caused many to 
speculate on the possibility of ancient contact between the peoples of 
Mesoamerica and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
From the ancient Mayan city of Palenque, there will be an exquisitely 
naturalistic sculptured stucco head with an unforgettable penetrating, yet 
tranquil gaze. Julie Jones, curator for this section of the exhibition, 
explains that recent breakthroughs in cracking the Mayan hieroglyphic language 
allow us to now identify this figure as the king Pacal II, who ruled Palenque 
during during its 7th-Century heyday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jones, the pre-Columbian portion of the show will not just be "the 
son of 'Before Cortes,' " -- the Metropolitan's 1970 show -- but will reflect 
the expansion of knowledge related to the ancient cultures of Mexico that has 
taken place over the last 50 years, with such "meaningful digging" as the 1978 
excavation of the Templo Mayor in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The cultures of civilizations before the conquest will be further explored 
through artifacts of the great cities of Izapa, Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, 
Palenque, El Tajin, Chichen Itza and Tenochtitlan. 
</P>
<P>
With the mixing of Spanish and indigenous blood after the conquest, Mexican art 
begins to reflect the mastery and subtle transformation of European artistic 
styles, along with an abiding rootedness in the ritual power and visual drama 
of the Pre-Hispanic cultures. A good deal of the rest of the show will 
illustrate this extraordinary tension which is the veritable reactor core of 
the Mexican tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than finding continuity," observes Johanna Hecht, curator for the 
Colonial -- or Viceregal -- element of the collection, "I would say there is a 
kind of attitude or historical sensibility that carries through. Aztecs 
attempted to identify with the Toltecs. And the criollos and mestizos come to 
do the same with the Aztecs." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to advance criticism of her section by some art critics, Hecht 
insists she is not presenting "conquistador art." Indeed, there will be an 
anonymous miniature folk sculpture of St. James the Moor Killer, ironically 
depicted as a conquistador. Also, Jose de Alcibar's somber 1777 religious 
portrait of the newly ordained 22-year-old nun Sor Maria Ignacia de la Sangre, 
which out-Baroques the Spanish master Velazquez with a dizzying excess of 
floral ornamentation and fetishized Christian iconography that comes close to 
being neo-Aztecan kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
A stunning 16th-Century mosaic image of the Virgen de Guadalupe in the show 
stands six feet high and is executed entirely in mother-of-pearl inlay on wood, 
in a frame adorned with cracked shells. This artisanal object exudes a primal 
aura that resonates with the presence of the Madonna's Indian alter-image, 
Tonantzin, the Aztecan goddess who had been worshipped, before the Spanish 
</P>
<P>
came, on the hill where Juan Diego had his visions of the Virgen. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, because of lending restrictions, this mosaic is among several objects 
that will only appear in the Metropolitan Museum's installation of the show, 
depriving Los Angeles and San Antonio of potentially one of the most popular 
objects in the assembled collection. (This omission may yet lead to the first 
time someone comes to the Metropolitan Museum on a sacred pilgrimage -- a 
number of years ago, a replica from Mexico of the Virgen de San Juan de los 
Lagos attracted thousands of San Antonio worshipers to a barrio chapel to view 
and pray to the small figure.) 
</P>
<P>
With the works to be shown in the 19th- and 20th-Century sections of the 
exhibition, another current of the complex Mexican psyche will be evident. 
</P>
<P>
Rebellion and the struggle for independence are now almost genetically 
ingrained in the Mexican national consciousness. For many artists, this has 
provoked passionate efforts to transcend the Eurocentric vision of the 
conquistador that marked modern Mexico's beginning and achieve a completely 
native aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan show promises an array of explosive self-portraits that 
testify to this inner struggle among Mexican artists. From the smoldering stare 
of Hermenegildo Bustos painted in 1891, to the exotic personal mythology of 
Frida Kahlo's "Self Portrait With Monkeys," and the fiery iconoclasm of 
muralist David Alfaro Siquieros' self-portrait, where, with outstretched arm in 
front of him, the artist appears to be tearing at the canvas, attempting to 
escape, or perhaps, to pull the viewer in. All of these paintings, and other 
work by masters such as Jose Maria Velasco, Jose Guadalupe Posada, Diego Rivera 
and the major muralists, and Rufino Tamayo, testify to the crucible of 
self-exploration that has been the forge of revolutionary change in Mexico for 
the last two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the museum and foundation literature describing the monumental show 
emphasizes the theme of the Mexican tradition's grandeur and continuity, 
offering the images and objects of the massive exhibition as a collective 
symbol of modern Mexico's rich cultural patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico has one of the most ancient, continuous, and important artistic 
heritages of any region of the Americas," observes museum director Philippe de 
Montebello in one exhibition press release. "As our neighbor and friend it 
should be better known to us." 
</P>
<P>
The show itself will essentially be organized around the history, and 
prehistory, of the modern Mexican state. With one-third of the exhibits devoted 
to the pre-Columbian civilizations, and another third devoted to the colonial 
period, the remaining work will represent the Independence and Revolutionary 
periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively. The latest work dates 
from 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, from Mayan stelae to Diego Rivera, the assemblage approximates a 
family history of what Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari -- in 
another piece of exhibition literature -- calls "La identidad nacional" (The 
national identity). The President's office, along with the Ministry of Tourism, 
has gotten into the act with a festival of events, "Mexico: A Work of Art," 
adding yet another level of public relations patina to the Metropolitan show. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the new exhibition's rather safe conceptual scheme mimics the 
general outline of the 1940 MOMA show, as well as the 1978 exhibition at LACMA. 
Consequently, important recent experiences in Mexico's history, from the demise 
of the idealism of the muralists, to the 1968 student massacre at Tlateloco, 
crippling international debt, and the devastating Mexico City earthquake, will 
go unnoted. And we will have to wait for the next major Mexico show to hope for 
a more thematically reflective and syncretic approach to the profound questions 
Mexico's traditions present. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the omission of contemporary work, exhibition coordinator McDonald 
explains, "If we had tried to do it justice, we would've had to nibble back on 
other sections -- or break up the show with a staircase to another floor." (The 
exhibit also contains no folk art, which was included in the 1940 MOMA show.) 
</P>
<P>
While this artistic Circus Maximus of things Mexican is likely to win a new 
host of aficionados in New York City, it will be interesting to follow the 
Metropolitan show's impact in San Antonio and Los Angeles, where the rich array 
of objects and images may yet rekindle some of the nationalist artistic 
sentiment that marked so much Chicano art of the Movimiento period through the 
'60s and '70s. At a time when young Mexican Americans are exploring new 
expressions of their own "root aesthetic" in rap, performance art, and film, 
such exposure could add heat and light to their mounting critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever shortcomings or exaggerations may exist in the show's interstices, the 
exhibits, along with a season of related lectures and films, will compose a 
not-to-be-missed tableau of the ages of a nation. Of course, there would seem 
to be limits to what can be shipped and seen in this country. "You can't 
transport Teotihuacan or Monte Alban or a baroque church," muses McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" we are likely to glimpse the 
deeper streams of Mexican identity, too often overlooked in media coverage of 
the country's Byzantine political system, its poverty- and debt-burdened 
economy, and the perennial concern with the flow of undocumented workers across 
the U.S. border.

RICHARD EDER: THE FIRE THIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA FIRE BY JOHN EDGAR WIDEMAN (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 199 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bloodiest and -- relative to the level of disorder that provoked it -- most 
violent government repression ever undertaken in an American urban black 
community was the helicopter bombing of a Philadelphia slum house in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The house was occupied by MOVE, a Rastafarian-like commune that had resisted 
repeated municipal orders to vacate. The group was armed, and some level of 
force was required to accomplish the eviction. It turned out to be a 
mini-holocaust. The bomb killed 11 commune members, including five children, 
and burned down 53 houses. 
</P>
<P>
That horror provides the central imagery of the agonized fictional meditations 
and variations that make up "Philadelphia Fire." John Edgar Wideman's novel is 
a blaze of rage, but what makes the blaze hotter and the book more stunning is 
the despair that lies under it. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Wilson Goode, who ordered the bombing, is black. He was elected in the 
hope that Philadelphia, with its prosperity and strong civic and cultural 
traditions, might be the city where black voices and white resources could come 
together to reverse the spiral of urban decay and racial degradation. 
</P>
<P>
The cruel irony of Goode's decision provides Wideman, our most powerful and 
accomplished artist of the urban black world, with a theme so overwhelming and 
painful that it threatens to burst his throat. Sometimes it does, and his voice 
splinters and becomes inchoate. Sometimes, Wideman's genius for impassioned 
imagery triumphs and "Philadelphia Fire" delivers its message with a careening 
momentum and astonishing precision. 
</P>
<P>
If the telling is multifarious and passionate, the theme is straightforward and 
harsh. There is a narrator figure who, much like Wideman -- a Rhodes scholar, 
acclaimed writer and professor -- managed to rise out of disadvantage, thanks 
to talent, struggle and the opportunities that the '60s briefly opened. The 
thought was that such individual successes would in some fashion bring a whole 
people along. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a rising tide lifting all boats, a few rising boats were supposed to 
raise the ocean. For the achievers, the hope seemed genuine, despite uneasiness 
at enjoying the benefits of being its chosen instrument. Such uneasiness has 
flavored Wideman's books, and given them edge, anger and art. 
</P>
<P>
Now he uses the Philadelphia fire as the turning point, the end of the road. It 
stands, dramatically, for the less dramatic and more lethal turning of the last 
dozen years. Instead of tentatively holding out their hands, the privileged 
classes were encouraged to tuck them back in their pockets. And Wideman's black 
mayor, who thought he was to deliver his people, bombed them instead. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was a forced choice, in view of MOVE's violent resistance, and 
whether a white mayor would have felt empowered to make it, are debated 
questions. Whether any mayor would have ordered such a bombing in a 
middle-class white neighborhood, and if he had, whether the neighboring houses 
would have been so wretched and flimsy as to burn up, seems much less 
debatable. 
</P>
<P>
Do you try to join a society that is ready to bomb you? The question splits the 
narrator in two. One half is Wideman, writing and teaching in western 
Massachusetts. The other half is a figure named Cudjoe, who represents a 
Wideman in transition from a belief in peaceable means to a hesitant, 
despairing identification with extremes. Cudjoe lives in a comfortable literary 
exile in Greece; news of the fire sets him on a voyage of discovery back to 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
An image drives him. A boy named Simba was briefly spotted fleeing from the 
burning house, and subsequently disappeared. Cudjoe thinks of Simba -- he 
visualizes him caught in the cross-hairs of a policeman's sniper-scope -- as 
part of himself. And Wideman, in his own voice, reminds us of his own real son, 
jailed for a killing and seemingly lost to his father's world of achievement. 
Success is a fraud if you cannot bring your children too. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire" tells of Cudjoe/Wideman's search. He talks to Margaret Jones, one of the 
"slaves" of King, the leader and prophet of MOVE. He talks to Timbo, a former 
classmate now ensconced in power -- and bitterness -- as an aide to the mayor. 
He talks to the young men hanging around the neighborhood basketball court. And 
he recalls or imagines others: a white publisher who helped him get into print, 
members of a violent gang of boys for whom Simba is symbol and hero, and a 
ragged, picaresque wanderer named J. B. who also seems to be the dead King. 
</P>
<P>
It is a swirl of stories, images and voices. Some burn indelibly. Wideman has 
made fire his own, and there are fire figures everywhere, illuminating us and 
driving us back with heat and smoky confusion. 
</P>
<P>
There is the clotted, dreadlocked J. B. roaming implacably through the business 
district, begging, singing rap songs and transfixing the city's prosperous 
heedlessness like a risen Lazarus. Even more memorable is Margaret Jones' 
account of coming under the spell of King. 
</P>
<P>
An office worker with "my little bit of degree," determined to keep her place 
clean and rear her two children decently, she is repelled when she first sees 
King lounging in front of his house. He has J. B.'s dreadlocks, filth and 
stink. He is everything she abhors. Yet after a month or so, she is living with 
him. Her mother spent her life on aching feet, working as a maid and cleaning 
up for white folks. King's blazing defiance suddenly shows her that she is 
simply a better-paid maid. Her feet still hurt. "He got to me through my feet," 
she says. "Though he did it wrong, he did it right." 
</P>
<P>
Feet are Wideman's recurring sign; the most literal image of oppression. An 
oppressed body discharges its burden on its feet. In an extraordinary passage, 
the author describes a mound of sneakers beside a city fountain where the slum 
kids go to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
They are beat-up, "the way kids' shoes always are, but these scattered around 
on the wet steps, these were worse, gaping holes in the bottoms, shredded 
uppers, laces missing, shoes taped, patched, lined with cardboard. Cheapest 
concoctions of glue and foam and canvas that money could buy." 
</P>
<P>
But a lot of money. The ad-driven status symbol that exploits poverty and 
despair while seeming to promise that you can jog right away from them. And in 
a tremendous extrapolation, Cudjoe: 
</P>
<P>
". . . constructs a room to match the shoes, fills it with sleeping bodies, 
many funky pairs of sneakers set out overnight to dry. Constructs a row house 
to hold the room, matches it with house after house till there is a street, 
then a neighborhood matching the sorry-assed shoes he's ready to lace now and 
thinks of miles of streets he must negotiate to reach the fountain, how pebbles 
and grains of glass punch through the thin soles, how after walking awhile with 
his brothers and sisters in tow, it's like walking barefoot on burning coals, 
you don't stop and wait for a light to change, you charge through 
intersections, daring cars to hit you. Constructs a city to hold the 
neighborhood. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Cudjoe never finds Simba but the mayor's aide, Timbo, tells him about Simba's 
disciples, a gang of 15- and 16-year-olds that calls itself the Kiddie Kars 
Korps -- or KKK. (We will think of the Ku Klux Klan and register Wideman's 
savage irony.) They wild around the city. Their target is adults. In scrawled 
flyers -- did they write them? did some adult radical or police provocateur? -- 
they proclaim that the world belongs to them; that "olds" must be killed, 
robbed and exiled to islands. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything for the young," is their slogan, Timbo explains. "It's fair, they 
say, because everybody's young once. And nobody has to grow old if they don't 
want to." It is a bitter twist. Adults have eaten their children's seed corn 
and denied them decent schools and jobs, and made a profit by selling them 
drugs. Many of the young never will grow old, but not because they don't want 
to. They have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
It is in passages like these that Wideman's book comes to its burning focus. 
Elsewhere it rambles, clumsy and sometimes indecipherable. When he writes of a 
Maine vacation, of Cudjoe's troubled marriage, of the book editor, his control 
wavers; mainly, perhaps, because his heart doesn't seem to be in it. A long 
section about staging "The Tempest" with a cast of slum children has a 
diffuseness, even a sentimentality, that overwhelms a rather academic point 
about Caliban as the symbol of black oppression. 
</P>
<P>
Wideman holds nothing back. The unevenness, the repetitiveness, the partial 
chaos of "Fire" are, in a sense, the embodiment of his theme. An authentic 
culture is entangled and choked in a culture that is superimposed. The book can 
be as ungainly as Caliban or the dreadlocked King. The defect may be partly 
willed, but it is a defect in any case; a form that struggles to encompass its 
theme and often fails. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the successes are indelible. Wideman offers himself as a casualty of the 
struggle, but he is its victor as well.

I don't understand all this negativity about Roseanne Barr and her show. 
</P>
<P>
She's a genuine original. Critics and rivals seem to want to cut the ground out 
from under anyone more successful than they are. Roseanne's show is warm, 
funny, dumb and full of real human values . . . just like real life . . . 
that's why we relate to it. Why don't the critics go after "Golden Girls," 
"Night Court" and other prime-timers that are rife with off-color, sexually 
implicit offensive material that nobody seems to object to except ordinary 
people like us?

"It won't look that way at all!" Martha Clarke says, letting her laugh rip 
through the house. "Five days ago I was in such despair we called it the wake. 
The show wasn't working so I redid a third of it in 2 1/2 days. At least there 
is an ending and a beginning. Now, I just have to do the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the spur-of-the-moment, sui generis world of Clarke, one of the 
country's preeminent and more idiosyncratic avant-garde theater artists. 
</P>
<P>
A dancer and choreographer turned theater director, Clarke is the creator of 
four theatrical works -- "The Garden of Earthly Delights," "Vienna: Lusthaus," 
"The Hunger Artist" and "Miracolo d'Amore" -- that juxtapose artistic 
disciplines and vocabularies with puckish impunity and evoke sociopolitical 
themes from dreamlike images by turns violent and erotic, grotesque and 
lyrical. 
</P>
<P>
In the 16 years since Clarke first raised eyebrows by sending semi-nude dancers 
and actors flying on trapezes over the heads of her audience in "Garden," her 
1984 stage exploration of the Heironymous Bosch triptych, the director has 
divided critics and audiences with her esoteric yet visceral theatrical 
collages, whose "erotic energy is exquisite in its humane power," Jack Kroll, 
theater critic of Newsweek, wrote. 
</P>
<P>
When Clarke's "Miracolo d'Amore" premiered at Charleston's Spoleto Festival two 
years ago, the Italianate stage exploration of sexual violence drove several 
patrons from the theater because of its onstage male nudity. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's latest project, "Endangered Species," will open the Brooklyn Academy 
of Music's annual Next Wave Festival -- the premier avant-garde arts forum in 
the country. With a budget of $800,000, it is Clarke's most ambitious work to 
date and has elicited more than the usual amount of attention for its 
dramaturgy, which owes as much to Barnum &amp; Bailey-style hucksterism as it 
does to a post-modernist aesthetic. The 90-minute production will feature a 
cast of dancers, actors and animals -- and showcases a 9-year-old African 
elephant named Flora Baldini. The result is a dance-theater work about 
domination and extinction. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a film about elephant poaching a few years ago," Clarke says during the 
show's pre-New York workshop in Massachusetts' Berkshire Mountains. "And I 
wanted to see if I could try and use animals as characters -- not like Tom 
&amp; Jerry, but to see if you could put animals on stage without exploiting 
them, (to see) if I could use elements of the circus without making it into a 
circus." 
</P>
<P>
For "Endangered Species," Clarke has deconstructed that ancient popular art 
form, marrying some of its elements -- elephants and horses, bareback riding 
and high-wire acts -- to the director's usual cast of dancers, actors and 
singers, who perform a text adapted from Walt Whitman's 19th-Century epic poem, 
"Leaves of Grass," and accompanied by a sound track composed of old opera 
recordings, jungle noises, gun shots and Hitler's speeches. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is set in one of Clarke's typically minimalist but emotionally 
charged environments. She has converted the stage of BAM's 900-seat Majestic 
Theater into a circular expanse covered in gray ash. The stage is backed by a 
35-foot wall painted like a glowering sky, in which is set a massive corniced 
double-door that swings wide to reveal the elephant -- or occasionally a horse 
-- bathed in pure, white light. The result is a visual and aural collage that 
Clarke says "looks like a George Stubbs painting, you know, those English horse 
portraits with all that sky," and that explores man's inhumanity to man and the 
environment with specific references to the Holocaust and the American Civil 
War. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a much bigger subject matter than anything I've done in the past," 
Clarke says. She originally intended to focus more specifically on the 
Holocaust, a subject she had begun to investigate in "Vienna: Lusthaus," her 
1987 work that examined pre-World War I Vienna with its echoes of anti-Semitism 
and militarism. 
</P>
<P>
However, the substitution of the Whitman poetry for an earlier original text by 
Charles Mee, the writer and historian who had collaborated on "Vienna," as well 
as the use of Clarke's typically improvisational work processes, refocused 
"Endangered Species" so that it is "less European, less intellectual, less 
abstract" and "more about the continuation of life in general," Clarke says. 
</P>
<P>
"I always pick subjects that are hard -- 'Garden' was about heaven and hell -- 
and I don't know why," Clarke says with a slightly rueful laugh. "I am 
interested in history, but I have visual interest in history." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, nearly all theater works by Clarke began as dramatic responses to 
paintings. "Garden" was inspired by Bosch, the 15th-Century Dutch painter, 
"Vienna" by Egon Schiele, the Austrian draftsman, and "Miracolo" by 
18th-Century Venetian painter Giovanni Tiepolo. "Endangered Species" is 
something of a departure for Clarke. However, it is the most American of her 
works, which have "been rather Germanic in their origins," as she puts it. And 
the production is also a leap ahead for the director by being the least 
allusive. 
</P>
<P>
"Martha has always had this incredible painter's eye," says Harvey 
Lichtenstein, BAM's executive producer. "Her use of imagery comes from her 
dance background. But in 'Endangered Species,' she has become more 
sophisticated and has created work that is more complex, more integrated and is 
more about themes than a theatrical response to painted images." 
</P>
<P>
"I have a visual response to everything," says Clarke, who studied visual art 
before entering Juilliard as a dance student in the 1960s and who went on to 
found the modern dance troupe Pilobolus. "I was married to a sculptor and I 
have lived with a painter, so I have always been about eyes," she says, batting 
her lashes. 
</P>
<P>
A small woman in her mid-40s with loosely pinned dark hair, a dancer's posture 
and a frequent laugh, Clarke is sitting in the living room of her rented summer 
house on a rare day off from rehearsal. She has been at work on "Endangered 
Species" for nearly two years, or for almost as long as she has known Flora, 
the centerpiece of Circus Flora, a small, 5-year-old St. Louis-based circus 
that Clarke first encountered in Charleston, S.C., during the 1988 Spoleto 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
That chance encounter, in addition to seeing the film on elephant poaching, 
provided her initial inspiration. That and "a dream I had of this dancer on the 
back of a horse," she says. "That was the night I decided to do this." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Martha called me from Charleston and said, 'I want to do a piece 
with circus animals,' " recalls Lyn Austin, producing director of New York's 
Music-Theater Group, which is co-producing "Endangered Species" and is the 
theater where Clarke has worked for most of the past 15 years. "I've known 
Martha a long time and I know how she works, so I said, 'This is incredible, 
let's do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Clarke says the impetus for this piece is a desire to explore themes of 
oppression and extinction, but also to seek a more immediate response to 
animals. "I used to live on a farm and I am fascinated by animal movement," 
says Clarke, who owns one of the horses used in the production. "Like when 
crows settle on a cornfield, I would always wonder, 'How did they know how to 
make such beautiful spatial arrangements? Why can't choreography be that easy?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
As she did with most of her earlier productions, Clarke began to work on 
"Endangered Species" with small groups of dancers and actors in improvisational 
exercises. One of these involved an African-American actress and a white 
dancer, leading to the Civil War and racial oppression themes. "My work is a 
lot like painting with people," Clarke says, "creating tension between moving 
people and stationary people. It's sort of like controlling the frame of a 
photograph or a frame of film. Except you don't get to do close-ups or move the 
camera, you only have the eye of the audience to manipulate." 
</P>
<P>
Very early on in the process, Clarke enlisted the aid of her longtime 
collaborators -- set and costume designer Robert Israel, composer Richard 
Peaslee and lighting designer Paul Gallo -- to create what Clarke calls a 
"post-final Noah's Ark look, sort of shattered, a few horses, an elephant and a 
few people dressed like refugees walking through ashes and set against that 
huge painted sky." 
</P>
<P>
Israel says, "Because Martha has such a physical response to things, she works 
best when she has an environment to work in, an actively aggressive space for 
her to tame and control. Otherwise she is kind of wandering. " 
</P>
<P>
Clarke agrees. "When I do this stuff, I don't really know what I'm doing and 
you never get the long view. It's like painting the Sistine Chapel. My 
relationship to the whole thing is so myopic -- just magnified views of an 
elbow." 
</P>
<P>
Typically for the director, the addition of each new element to the collage -- 
in this case, the giant backdrop, Whitman's poetry, the operatic sound track -- 
involved extensive reworking of a creative process that Clarke describes as "a 
house of cards. You move one thing, everything moves." For example, the 
last-minute substitution of the Whitman work, adapted by writer Robert Coe, 
bolstered the production's themes of "love, sex, earth, death, (it) wasn't 
dialogue and the actors had to find characters and an edge in all that 
romanticism," Clarke says. The opera recordings, including Alma Gluck singing 
Rimsky-Korsakov, were thrown into the mix, she says, "because like old 
photographs, I thought they would be evocative of endangered civilizations. 
Like all that might be left of an elephant one day would be a video, you know: 
'dust to dust.' Old opera always sounded very dusty to me." 
</P>
<P>
"It is the juxtaposition and contrast that makes it interesting," says Peaslee, 
who assembled the score with composer Stanley Walden. "It's the effect of 
hearing opera in the jungle or Hitler in the jungle." It is also the first time 
that Clarke and Peaslee have used a prerecorded digital sound track rather than 
live musicians, and as the composer says, "We're hoping we can pan the sound 
around the theater" for even greater spatial effects. 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the animals. If not exactly two by two, they came with a 
myriad of technical problems that went beyond the demands of training the 
dancers to work the horses and the elephant. "It's just been unbelievable," 
Clarke says about the summerlong rehearsal process under a tent pitched on 
Herman Melville's estate in Stockbridge. "The horse I bought for the show went 
totally lame, I lost one dancer because of back problems, lost a drummer from 
Senegal. The budget was supposed to be a third bigger, so I couldn't use this 
17-foot giraffe named Vicky I had planned on. We had cracked ribs, sprained 
ribs, mosquitoes, storms, mud and flooding and no private life at all. Many 
times I just thought why am I doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
In addition to wrestling with the technical difficulties, Clarke also had to 
prune her use of the animals to keep the production from becoming too 
circuslike. First to go was a goat, a macaw and a Capuchin monkey, because 
"small animals look too cute on stage," Clarke says. Then came adjustments in 
the elephant's performance. "Flora is a comedian and her rhythms are those of 
the circus, not the theater," she says. "She was throwing clothes out of a 
suitcase and pouring tea. She was very funny but we had to respect the 
integrity of the Whitman. It was hard to let her be a clown and still give the 
show some bite." 
</P>
<P>
About her work process, Clarke adds, "It's like writing fiction or carving 
marble. You keep saying this has to go, this has to go. I love economy and a 
certain degree of minimalism as long as it's emotionally charged minimalism." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke traces that minimalism to her years as a dancer with Pilobolus. She 
began moving into the realm of theater and the use of spoken text in the late 
1970s. "I used to get so bored performing, I would cry on stage," Clarke says. 
Her first theater work -- the 35-minute, two-person "Metamorphosis in 
Miniature," based on Kafka's writings -- played at Austin's Music-Theater Group 
with the help of actor Linda Hunt. That piece won an Obie award and led Clarke 
into further hybrid theater pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Clarke's work is considered distinctive for its improvisational 
approach, and the use of "found" objects that is similar to the approaches of 
the Open Theater and Living Theater during the 1960s. Her work also has echoes 
of the classical modernism practiced by choreographers Antony Tudor and Jose 
Limon in the '70s and bears more than a passing resemblance to the imagistic 
theater pioneered by director Robert Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"She is non-imitable," says Michael Feingold, a theater critic with the Village 
Voice. "She doesn't deal in the conventions of performance art, although she is 
most at ease with the physical vocabulary of dance, she is really about image 
theater. Her genre is what everyone disagrees about." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout all the head scratching, however, Clarke has worked slowly but 
steadily, most often under the aegis of the Music-Theater Group, surviving on a 
series of grants and awards. She has won a Guggenheim, several National 
Endowment for the Arts grants, and this year a $285,000 MacArthur grant, 
largess that Clarke describes as having arrived in the nick of time, "because I 
think I've finally made it onto Jesse's (Helms') hit list." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke says she would like to give her work a rest. "I want to go home, make 
dinner, read books, see my friends," she says. "And the MacArthur will make it 
possible for me to do more traveling. I know Europe very well, but I want to 
see South America, India, Russia, Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Next up on the creative docket? Clarke will possibly direct a ballet in Italy, 
an opera in Canada, or maybe make a film. "I think it's the seven-year itch," 
she says, smiling. "I want to go work where there is more structure and also I 
think that film is logical development of my discipline. Maybe it won't be, but 
I would like to try." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about overall significance of her compact but ground-breaking 
artistry, Clarke emits another shriek of laughter, accompanied by a chorus from 
the songbirds here in her living room. "I'm not intellectual at all. I guess, 
in a way, my work is really about the realm of dreams. It has been a way to 
discipline my devils, get one's snakes out of their lair and make sense of 
them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying my work is therapeutic, but you do reveal yourself to yourself. 
I'm a kind of nice Jewish girl from Baltimore. I like a clean house, nice 
furniture, good food. Then I look at this Angst on the stage, this intensity 
and I say, where does that come from? It's like the three faces of Eve. Like 
what is that voice? It's not the voice that brushes her teeth. It's the 
subliminal voice."

<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Levinson is a born storyteller. Perched in the back of a van packed with 
his production crew, the Baltimore-born director is riding around town, 
scouting locations for "Bugsy," his upcoming film starring Warren Beatty as 
Bugsy Siegel, the gangster who ruled 1940s L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Heading for Union Station, the van cruises through a particularly beat-up 
section of Hollywood, near the Hollywood Bowl. "You know, when I first moved to 
L.A., I lived right around here," says Levinson, peering out the window at a 
pair of LAPD squad cars parked outside a crumbling apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here, it was the hippie period. We were all broke so I lived with 
this guy, Leo, and another friend in an apartment for $80 a month. Leo lived in 
the closet." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson grins. "But it was a big closet. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, was it the '60s! I remember coming home one day and finding Leo on the 
couch, groaning and moaning. He said, 'Oh, I'm really sick. I feel awful. I 
took a couple of pills.' I was concerned, so I asked him what kind of pills. He 
said, 'Oh, I don't know. A couple of pills. I found them on the sidewalk.' 
</P>
<P>
"I went nuts. 'You took pills off the sidewalk! Are you crazy? They could've 
killed you!' And all Leo said was, 'Yeah, but it could've been good, man.' " 
</P>
<P>
Levinson wags his head. "That's the '60s, isn't it? 'It could've been good.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's this love for language -- the rich impasto of slang, small talk and 
crackling argument -- that has made Levinson, at 48, one of Hollywood's most 
bankable -- and most distinctive -- writer-directors. After a long 
apprenticeship as a TV comedy hand and screenwriter, Levinson has been a 
director of megahits in recent years, most notably "Good Morning, Vietnam" and 
"Rain Man," for which he won the Oscar as best director. 
</P>
<P>
But he's also made time to write and direct a trio of personal films -- 
"Diner," "Tin Men" and now "Avalon" -- that explore his Baltimore roots. Due 
out Friday, "Avalon" is an ambitious, largely autobiographical drama that 
explores the tumultuous assimilation of an immigrant clan into American 
society. Its central character is another storyteller -- Sam Krichinsky, a role 
largely based on -- and even named after -- Levinson's own grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, ask Levinson to describe "Avalon" and you'll hear the story of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a child I was fascinated by my family," he says, relaxing in the 
cozy study of his Bel-Air home. "I loved looking at the old photographs and 
hearing the old stories. When my grandfather and his brothers would tell 
stories, it was exciting. I knew my grandfather like he was my father. He was 
quite a character. He had a great sense of adventure and a wonderful sense of 
humor about how he viewed life. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go to movies together. I'd hang out with him when he'd do a wallpapering 
job. It was like having two fathers." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson's father worked in the door-to-door installment sales business before 
opening his own appliance shop in the late 1940s. His best-selling products 
were those newfangled TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the whole postwar boom," says Levinson, who adorns his study with 
family pictures, stacks of scripts, a Tyson-Douglas fight poster and a 
Baltimore Orioles cap. "TV's brought the customers in the door. In fact, 
business exploded. In less than three years, my father went from a small shop 
to a big warehouse. I can actually remember the people lining up to get in, the 
fire marshals being there to keep order. And I can remember his store burning 
down in an electrical fire." 
</P>
<P>
If you see Levinson's new film, you'll watch these memories unfold up on the 
screen. With a cast that includes Armin Mueller-Stahl and Joan Plowright as his 
grandparents and Aidan Quinn and Elizabeth Perkins as his parents, "Avalon" is, 
at its best, a memory film that uses Levinson's own experiences to capture the 
blood ties -- and the wracking tension -- that first cement and then split 
immigrant families. 
</P>
<P>
"As I began to think about it, I realized I had a lot of great material -- our 
move to suburbia, the splitting up of the family -- to use for a film," 
Levinson explained. "I went back and talked to my family, who would remind me 
of stories I'd forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
When Levinson shot the film in Baltimore last fall, his father came down to see 
a set that replicated his old appliance store. "It must've been a little 
strange for him, because it was like stepping back into a part of his life. I 
remember him saying something like, 'I think the TVs are in the wrong place.' 
But I think he was really moved by the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the family was so impressed. Levinson cast a host of his 
relatives in other bits in the film, including a scene set at his grandmother's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little awkward telling them how to react, because it was someone 
they'd actually known and loved," he recalls. "So I'm giving them direction, 
trying to figure out what to have them do, when finally one of them complained, 
'We know. We know. It's the second time we went to her funeral!' " 
</P>
<P>
"Avalon's" supporters see it as a loving look at an immigrant family that was 
nourished by America -- and torn apart by America. The movie's detractors 
aren't as generous. After a recent screening, one sharp-tongued Hollywood 
writer dubbed it "a $30-million home movie." (The filmmakers say the budget was 
actually just under $20 million.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, Levinson acknowledges it would be hard to imagine getting a studio to 
back such a deeply personal film without the clout of his "Rain Man" and "Good 
Morning, Vietnam." "Would an unknown director have gotten 'Avalon' made?" 
Levinson wonders aloud. "Probably not. Look at it. No stars, no sex, no 
violence. You can just imagine people saying, 'So, what kind of movie is this 
supposed to be?' " 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that "Avalon" dramatizes the role TV has played in the 
disintegration of the American family. Television and its discontents -- it's 
one of the few subjects, outside the fortunes of his beloved Orioles, that 
sparks a burst of emotion from the normally imperturbable director. 
</P>
<P>
"It all comes down to TV," he says, beginning to pace restlessly around the 
room. "Our movies are being radically changed by what TV has done. The film 
that can't be sold in a 30-second spot is in jeopardy of not being made. I had 
these same discussions on 'Avalon.' The studio says, 'Hmmm, it's going to be a 
tough sell. How are we going to make a 30-second spot to sell this movie?' " 
</P>
<P>
Levinson slumps back in his chair. "The problem is that we sell everything that 
way now. We have fast-food movies and now we have fast-food politics. It's 
become so hard to sell anything complicated that we end up with these 
politicians and their (expletive) campaigns. 'He's tough on crime! He's tough 
on schools!' It's crazy -- all you get is a slogan." 
</P>
<P>
In Levinson's eyes, this is the legacy of television. "It's stripped away 
everything and left us with personality. It's gotten to the point where even 
People magazine has gotten too complicated. They'll probably have to come up 
with something simpler soon. It's frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson flashes a lopsided grin. "I saw a TV film critic the other day 
reviewing 'Dreams,' and I had to laugh. Even Akira Kurosawa, who's won every 
award imaginable, got reduced to the 1-to-10 scale." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson sighs. "We all go on the scale. Maybe they'll start going back to all 
the great old directors and rate them. You know -- Hitchcock. A 7! . . . Von 
Stroheim. A 5!" 
</P>
<P>
Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg thinks rating Hollywood talent is 
crass, too. But he gets positively florid discussing Levinson. "Barry isn't on 
anybody's A-list," says Katzenberg, who worked with Levinson on "Tin Men," 
"Good Morning, Vietnam" and "Young Sherlock Holmes." "He is a list of one -- he 
is a list by himself. If anything, Barry falls into a sovereign state. In the 
unending battle between art and commerce, I don't think any filmmaker has found 
a better way to master the equation. Every movie he makes is artful -- and 
entertaining. From the moment he made 'Diner,' everybody's wanted to work with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. In the past six years, Levinson has worked with an incredible 
array of male Hollywood starpower: Robert Redford ("The Natural"), Tom Cruise 
and Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Robin Williams ("Good Morning, Vietnam"), 
Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss ("Tin Men") and now, Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
If film executives appreciate Levinson's classy box-office touch, his actors 
enjoy his relaxed yet invigorating filmmaking style. "Once you get past his 
Australian accent -- can you imagine, an Australian from Baltimore -- Barry has 
a real vision of what he wants," says Robin Williams. "He's funny, but it's not 
shtick -- it's stories and characters. It's a whole world. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd let me try anything," Williams continues. "When I was doing my 'Vietnam' 
radio show broadcasts, he brought in a live audience -- some ladies from the 
U.S. Embassy -- so I could hear their laughter in my headset, just to see if it 
would help me play the scenes better. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think the characters in his films have great timing, it's because it's 
his timing. He somehow infects us with his comic abilities. I call it 
Levinson's Disease." 
</P>
<P>
Danny DeVito was most impressed by Levinson's easy manner. "It's effortless 
with Barry," he says. "He's not imposing or heavy-handed, he just lets you do 
your work. And when you're working with one of his scripts, it's great -- his 
words are gems." 
</P>
<P>
Spend a day with Levinson and you can hear a few spontaneous gems. Somewhat 
reticent under a reporter's scrutiny (he dons his shades during interviews), 
Levinson is considerably looser and more affable when he's roaming around town 
with his movie team, which includes producer Mark Johnson, director of 
photography Allen Daviau and production designer Dennis Gassner. 
</P>
<P>
As he enters Union Station, Levinson reminisces about his first cross-country 
train ride. "I'd been on these wonderful trains in Europe where you stay in the 
dining car for hours and they'd just keep coming with all these marvelous 
things to eat," he explains. "It was so sumptuous. Then I took the train from 
back East out here. It was like being in Denny's for 48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Eyeing the broad, Art Deco sweep of Union Station, Levinson is trying to 
determine which areas will work for a key scene from "Bugsy." As you watch 
Levinson studying the high-ceilinged terminal, you can just picture Warren 
Beatty gliding into view, a pair of '40s gunsels at his side, flashing a quick 
grin as he passes a clump of boyish P-51 Mustang pilots flirting with some 
off-duty WACS. 
</P>
<P>
As Levinson strides through the terminal, he's clearly dazzled by the 
structure's striking design. "Look at these tones -- aren't they wonderful?" he 
says to Daviau as they scurry back and forth, looking for camera angles. "Wow. 
They really built then." 
</P>
<P>
Someone suggests installing seating for movie extras to make the space seem 
less empty. "No," Levinson replies. "Sometimes you don't need a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Johnson, Levinson's longtime producer, grins broadly. "So what are you 
saying, Barry?" he teases. "You think we can get by with three people? Maybe 
four?" 
</P>
<P>
Levinson laughs as he walks outside. "Well, sometimes it plays better with 
less. It doesn't always have to look like Grand Central Station." 
</P>
<P>
From across the street, Levinson studies his establishing shot -- the 
palm-framed entrance to Union Station. His crew notes several 'period' eyesores 
-- an Amtrak sign and street markings that would be out of place in a '40s 
film. "You know what the real problem is," Levinson says, hitching up his beige 
Presto Pants slacks. "Those palm trees are too tall. We'll never get them in 
the shot." 
</P>
<P>
The solution? "I tell you what," says Levinson, displaying Hollywood ingenuity. 
"We may just have to bring in some shorter trees." 
</P>
<P>
A robust, self-effacing man, Levinson insists he had no show-biz dreams as a 
child. He was already in college before he started taking television classes at 
American University -- and then only after abandoning his initial goal of being 
an income-tax lawyer. "I gave it up when I realized I would have to take an 
accounting class." 
</P>
<P>
After working at local TV stations -- where he did everything from handling 
kiddie-show puppets to cutting ad spots for the Washington Senators baseball 
team -- Levinson drove to California. As a fluke he joined an acting class and 
ended up performing skits and writing comedy routines. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote for a host of TV variety shows, then moved to feature films, where he 
served an apprenticeship to Mel Brooks (co-writing "Silent Movie" and "High 
Anxiety") and wrote an Oscar-nominated script, ". . . And Justice for All" with 
his then-wife, Valerie Curtin. 
</P>
<P>
He made his directorial debut with "Diner" in 1982, which introduced audiences 
to a whole generation of fresh talent, including Mickey Rourke, Ellen Barkin, 
Steve Guttenberg and Kevin Bacon. Levinson has enjoyed box-office success with 
most of his films, but critics have lavished most of their praise on his more 
personal projects. Though Levinson says he had no grand design, his Baltimore 
movies all chronicle the workings of a close-knit group on the verge of 
disintegration, the friends veering off in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
In "Diner," we see the intimate male bonds of adolescence give way to marriage 
and adulthood. In "Tin Men," we witness the death of aluminum-siding 
salesmanship. And in "Avalon," we see a sprawling immigrant family torn apart 
by generational schisms and the hypnotic tug of television. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of "Rain Man," all of Levinson's films have been set in the 
past. When you drive with him around L.A., he often exhibits a wistful 
attachment -- rooted more in respect than nostalgia -- for bygone eras. When 
his Union Station guide informs him that the main terminal will be redesigned 
to include a two-story mall, Levinson snaps sarcastically: "Now that's a good 
idea. They figured, why waste the high ceiling, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Don't think Levinson is being sentimental. "There's a difference between being 
nostalgic and remembering what society once was," he says. "If you look at our 
buildings from the '30s, you see men at work, creating buildings and dams and 
bridges -- it was the power and optimism of man. But look at the murals of 
today. They're all cartoons. We once believed that anything was possible. We 
don't have that optimism any more. Now we can only joke about it." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson avoids such weighty talk about his own work. A private man, he gives 
few interviews and clearly prefers being with his wife, Diana, and two young 
boys, Sam and Jack. He even edits his films at home, dryly noting, "I have to 
deal with fewer people this way." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the emotional impact of making a film about his family, he 
dodges the question with a joke. He's elusive, just like his own characters, 
who debate the authenticity of "Bonanza" or the merits of Frank Sinatra, but 
rarely reveal what's really on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my theory that people don't argue about the real issue -- they talk 
around it," he says, back home in his office. "Most of the time we argue about 
nothing. A man and a woman could be angry over selfishness or some larger 
issue, but the argument focuses on what's annoying someone at that specific 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson coaxes both humor from these arguments and a surprising measure of 
insight into ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
In "Avalon," Sam Krichinsky, the character based on Levinson's grandfather, is 
the family storyteller, keeping the legacy of his clan alive. Now Levinson has 
inherited the mantle, preserving his tales on film. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought of myself wanting to be a storyteller, but perhaps its true," 
he says. "My characters let me create a fascinating world that you can't always 
figure out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny -- you never know how people will react to your work. Someone who 
saw 'Avalon' complained about how predictable the end of the movie is. Well, of 
course it is. That's the inevitability of life. You grow old. What am I going 
to do, fake a heart attack for them?" 
</P>
<P>
Levinson stares at the family portraits across the room. 
</P>
<P>
"But what fascinates me isn't the situation. It's what the character says 
inside those situations. It's what you find inside people that's really 
revealing." 
</P>

A TERMINALLY MARGINAL FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
BLUEPRINTS BY SARA VOGAN (BANTAM BOOKS: $19.95, CLOTH; $8.95, PAPER; 288 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Brendan Healey, Healey writes for the Valley Edition of The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mitch Snyder, the now-deceased homeless-rights advocate, used to equate the 
nuclear family with nuclear war. After finishing Sara Vogan's "Blueprints," the 
reader may begin to make the same comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Vogan portrays a family that cuts a swath of destruction around itself and 
leaves a trail of battered psyches in its wake. Out of this wasteland of a 
1950s dream family gone bad steps a narrator, the daughter, Maureen Emery 
Lannier: 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I went to college I hated my name so much I dropped it altogether. 
Emery, my grandmother's maiden name, felt right. I liked the idea of grinding 
and polishing, a hard abrasive substance. I grew to see myself like that; 
grinding and polishing myself to remove the traces of Frank and Nina from my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
However, Emery can neither scrape away her parents, Frank and Nina, nor get 
them to call her anything but Maura. 
</P>
<P>
The narrative begins when the 40-ish Emery goes to her parents' house hoping to 
find the home she has never had. After spending the last 25 years trying to run 
away from her parents and her past, Emery is looking to make peace with them 
(her mother has written that Emery's father is about to die) as well as with 
herself. Soon after her arrival, her parents' house burns to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Fires can be cathartic, therapeutic, the kind of controlled burning that allows 
forests to grow back stronger than before. However, this fire symbolically 
reveals the rotted foundation, or blueprint, of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
In this book, the emotional and physical scars left on the soul and body serve 
as the blueprints upon which lives are built. "Even though he (Drew) was my 
brother, our scars weren't identical," says Emery. "We all grow up differently, 
learn different lessons. Tattoos. Scars. Scars don't tan. Scars don't heal. 
Scars don't. Scars are. " 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how much Emery would like to turn her back on the past and its 
scars, she can not. On one level, the narrative deals with Emery's attempts to 
deal with present-day life, the effort to find her parents new housing and the 
like. In a subtext, driven by her frequent flashbacks as she metonymically 
skips between past and present, she attempts to deal with the past. She knows, 
however, that "reinventing the past is as impossible as skating on hot water." 
</P>
<P>
The Lanniers resemble the self-contained, eccentric, virtually friendless 
families that Anne Tyler creates. However, with the Lanniers, eccentricities 
shade into pathologies. "My family must be terminally marginal," Emery thinks. 
"We were a normal, middle-class family. On the right track in a wrecked car. " 
</P>
<P>
The parents, Frank and Nina, drink themselves into stupors nearly every night. 
Nina, who rivals Fitzgerald's Nicole Diver for literary lunacy, drifts in and 
out of hallucinatory periods and catatonic states. "Frankly, I enjoyed my 
mother most when we were drinking," Emery confesses, "not when she was sober or 
drunk, but those early stages about a quarter of the way down the bottle, when 
she was just loose enough to appear to be actually talking to you. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The children, Emery and Drew, are so shellshocked from their childhood that 
they refuse to marry or bear children. They take refuge in each other. " 
'There's always been you and I,' Drew said. 'We've never gotten close to anyone 
else.' " There also is a third child, Julia, long dead, present in the book 
only through her absence. 
</P>
<P>
Absences affect this book like black holes, always tugging at characters. 
Throughout her works, Vogan deals with loss, whether it be the loss of a limb 
-- a particular fascination of hers -- or of a lover. Emery's sometime lover, 
Paris, and her younger sister, Julia, hover in the penumbra of "Blueprints," 
although Paris does make a few appearances. According to Emery, "We all live 
with ghosts. Paris is my ghost, Julia is my mother's." Emery can say goodby to 
Paris, if only for a while, but her mother cannot say goodby to Julia. 
</P>
<P>
In "Blueprints" as well as in her other books ("In Shelly's Leg," "Loss of 
Flight," "Scenes From the Homefront"), Vogan knits facts, concrete knowledge, 
into the fabric of fiction, almost as if she is following the Renaissance ethos 
of attempting to instruct and delight. Content affects style because her 
writing often takes on a didactic air. 
</P>
<P>
Vogan front-loads paragraphs, beginning them with the sort of topic sentences 
typically found in expository writing. Not only does this give her writing a 
unique flavor, it also gives her prose a punchy quality without weighing it 
down in details. 
</P>
<P>
Facts provide means of communication when emotions fail, and provide characters 
with an anchor when uncertainty swirls around them. "Shopping carts were 
invented in Oklahoma City, you know that?" Emery asks Drew. "Facts again. A 
fact could be used as a tool in any emergency. The verbal equivalent of a Swiss 
Army Knife." 
</P>
<P>
Vogan's use of facts further expands a wide-ranging voice. Vogan writes 
convincingly of the human world and lyrically about the natural world. Phrases 
remain. " 'Actually, I'm waiting for the snow. If you look,' and he (Kiskejohn) 
pointed toward the moon, 'you can almost see the cold drawing up into the 
clouds,' " or Emery: "That was the first sunrise I remember, opening as 
gracefully as a blood-red fan." 
</P>
<P>
Vogan's vision includes a transcendent, almost mystical perception of the body 
that reminds one of John Casey and perhaps traces back to Emerson. Emery (a 
female Emerson?) has a hypersensitive awareness of her body as if she is at 
once observing it and inhabiting it: "My spirit was sinking, slipping like 
mercury down my spine to pool in my instep. . . . My blood felt thick as honey 
and just as slow." 
</P>
<P>
Vogan presents interpersonal relations with similar sensitivity. Her ear for 
dialogue, particularly Nina's lucid ravings and lunatic logic, is incisive. Her 
characterizations are, by and large, convincing and complete. If one character 
is not entirely clear it is Emery, perhaps the most complex character Vogan has 
yet created and perhaps a character not intended to be fully understood. Emery 
removes veil after veil as the book progresses, yet her image remains as hazy 
and shifting as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Vogan's fourth book and third novel, "Blueprints" is powerfully well written. 
Certain themes or interests -- Eskimos, the Arctic, sharks, birds, animals, 
dreams -- course through Vogan's writing. The "fight-or-flight" motif, so 
prominent in the previous books, is again central; nonetheless she continues to 
impress in this, her first novel written in the first person, with the 
startling breadth of her imagination.

SHOOTING THEIR OWN; 
</P>
<P>
IN A WAR FOR VIEWERS, CABLE CHANNELS AND THE NETWORKS ARE PRODUCING THEIR OWN 
MOVIES IN RECORD NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY MILLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once a Hollywood runt, the made-for-TV movie has quietly grown into a behemoth. 
Thanks to the cable industry's increasing determination to create its own 
programming, viewers will be able to tune in to nearly 250 original movies and 
miniseries between now and next September. 
</P>
<P>
Even PBS' "Wonderworks" has switched to an all-movie format. 
</P>
<P>
There were eight original movies on TV last week and there are five more this 
week -- including two tonight: "Face of Fear" on CBS and "Perry Mason: The Case 
of the Defiant Daughter" on NBC. Monday night, NBC airs "Promises to Keep." CBS 
serves up "Angel of Death" on Tuesday, then is back Friday with "Children of 
the Bride." 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, there were fewer than 100 TV movies made, and most were for 
the three networks," observes Aaron Cohen, senior vice president of programming 
at N. W. Ayer, who chooses the movies that AT&amp;T and General Motors sponsor. 
"Now the number of players in the field has tripled." 
</P>
<P>
TV movies are proliferating because ratings show there is an enormous public 
appetite for them. But the expansion has brought problems. Producers have to 
compete for the services of top writers and actors; then comes the crunch of 
finding an audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Viewers are making their decision at 8:58 p.m. as to what they'll watch," says 
Allan Sabinson, ABC's executive vice president of motion pictures for 
television and miniseries, who will dish out 31 new titles this season. "With 
all the different cable outlets, and Fox starting up a movie night, how do you 
do something interesting that gets their attention?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder than ever to turn out movies that don't look, feel and sound like 
what everybody else is doing," says John Matoian, vice president for movies and 
miniseries at CBS, which will make 32-37 original productions. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there is a glut in the marketplace," concedes Tony Masucci, senior vice 
president of miniseries and motion pictures for television at NBC, the 
industry's biggest producer with 40 original movies and miniseries planned for 
1990-91. "But movies are still a viable programming alternative. They probably 
perform better than any new programming. Over the last several years, while the 
network shares were declining, the three networks' movie-of-the-week shares 
remained constant." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Masucci adds a cautionary note. "Since cable got into movies, our 
movie-of-the-week ratings are dropping. NBC may see the demise of one night of 
movies (out of two on the current prime-time schedule) -- maybe next year." 
</P>
<P>
Even if NBC cuts its movie production in half, however, Fox Broadcasting will 
pick up the slack. The fledgling network will air its first made-for-TV movie 
in November and plans to schedule one or two every month in 1991. And both 
Lifetime and The Family Channel have launched modest movie schedules. "Since 
women watch made-for-TV and cable movies, it seemed the most natural way to 
break out," notes Melinda Fishman, vice president of original movies for 
Lifetime, a basic cable service that programs for women. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Channel is approaching movie programming more cautiously. "Six 
months after a viewer watches a movie, he won't remember where he saw it," says 
Paul Krimsier, Family's vice president of programming. "We're making a few 
movies, but I'm more anxious to increase the number of original series we do 
because they will build network loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
In the cable world, Krimsier's voice is in the minority. "Series are riskier 
and more expensive," believes Scott Sassa, executive vice president of 
programming for TNT, which will make 33 movies this season. "When we started 
TNT in 1988, we needed high-profile programs that would draw attention to us. 
We chose films because we could get the most publicity for our money. We hoped 
people would say, 'Gee, they have good movies. I should subscribe.' " 
Apparently they did. From a 17 million subscriber start-up, TNT now reaches 48 
million households. 
</P>
<P>
USA Network, which is now making 30 movies a year, was similarly motivated. 
"Last year we felt we needed to have a presence in original production in a 
highly visible way, and movies were a way to achieve that goal," says Dave 
Kenin, USA's senior vice president of programming. "Wednesday had been a so-so 
night for us. Now, as our movie night, it's No. 1 in terms of (audience) 
delivery." 
</P>
<P>
HBO, Showtime and The Disney Channel, all pay-cable networks, have made their 
own films in the past but have recently decided to step up production. 
"Overwhelmingly, original movies are a great influence on retaining 
subscribers," Disney Channel president John F. Cooke says. "They also bring 
subscribers because people read about them and see them listed. Every year we 
make more because our subscribers want them." 
</P>
<P>
"Ratings of HBO movies on average are higher than (theatrical) movies we get 
from studios," says Robert Cooper, senior vice president of HBO Pictures. "More 
subscribers watch HBO-produced pictures than the average movie on our service. 
If you look at the gross rating points, which add up all the times each movie 
plays, an HBO picture measures 43 while the average picture measures 31. That 
means we have a 39% advantage for our pictures. In homes that get HBO, an HBO 
picture gets about a 10% higher rating than network programming when it first 
premieres." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who made the first original cable movie, "The Terry Fox Story," in 
1983, jokes about the current proliferation of product, "I started some of the 
trouble. We believed it could lead to a lot of films for HBO. We didn't know it 
would explode out of HBO. An HBO movie used to be an event. It is no longer. 
Now people want to know, 'What's the hook?' " 
</P>
<P>
Competition for good scripts and top actors is becoming more heated than ever. 
"I see a problem in having a lot of good actors who do good work bumping up 
against themselves," CBS' Matoian says, referring to such instances as "L.A. 
Law's" Michael Tucker starring in his network's "Archie's Wife" and NBC's 
"Casey's Gift: For Love of a Child." "Hopefully we'll attract more talent from 
outside the TV world. For instance, this season we'll have Glenn Close and 
Christopher Walken in 'Sarah, Plain and Tall.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Law, executive producer of PBS' "American Playhouse," who has been 
making high-quality, low-budget movies for a decade, notes, "It's been more 
difficult for us casting lately because there's a wider range of choices for 
actors." The surge in TV/cable movies comes at a time when the feature film 
business has thrown heavy resources into action pictures. "Because small 
theatrical production companies are falling on hard times, a whole wealth of 
talent that was making interesting independent movies in America is coming to 
us," says Colin Callender, executive producer of HBO Showcase, a division of 
HBO that makes lower-budget films. 
</P>
<P>
Others are finding projects in someone else's rejection pile. "Some of our 
scripts were sitting around," USA Network's Kenin says. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the TV movie's continuing image problem? Since its inception 26 
years ago, the form has often been brushed off as merely a modern incarnation 
of the old B-movie. 
</P>
<P>
"They are B-movies," NBC's Masucci acknowledges, "but B means budget, made for 
a price. B doesn't mean bad." 
</P>
<P>
With so many TV movies being made, programmers increasingly are trying to 
pinpoint specific audiences rather than cater to everyone. The major networks, 
of course, have a broader mandate than their competitors, but even they have 
recognized the importance of niche programming. Following is a breakdown of the 
movie-making philosophy of each broadcast and cable network that makes original 
films. 
</P>
<P>
ABC -- Philosophy: "This season will be markedly different," says Allan 
Sabinson, executive vice president of motion pictures for television and 
miniseries. "We're moving toward quality pieces and first-rate original dramas. 
We're also dealing with issues -- civil rights, AIDS, rights of the 
handicapped, treatment of American Indian natives, the Middle East. We're 
moving away from ripped-from-the-headlines docudramas. We've done them ('The 
Preppie Murder'; 'Challenger'), and we'll do them again, but for the moment 
they've been done to a point where it's a joke. We think audiences are tired of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: Primarily women. "Women are more desirable to advertisers. The male 
does more zapping. They are more fickle viewers. They're more apt to go off in 
pursuit of sports or cable." 
</P>
<P>
CBS -- Philosophy: "We try to get an incredibly varied slate of movies," says 
John Matoian, vice president of movies and miniseries. "We will have comedy, 
romantic comedy, horror, science fiction, Westerns and headline movies. We want 
to do event movies that attract major casting. We eventually hope to attract a 
younger audience." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: Sunday night -- primarily women; Tuesday night -- lead-in is "Rescue 
911," which attracts a lot of male viewers, so CBS hopes to attract men and 
women to its movie offering. "When you try to please everybody, you end up 
pleasing nobody," Matoian says. "But when you're reaching a much larger 
audience and an advertiser-supported network base, you're less able to 
specialize." 
</P>
<P>
NBC -- Philosophy: "A balanced cross-section of films not weighted to one genre 
or another," says Tony Masucci, senior vice president of miniseries and motion 
pictures for television. "In terms of content, I do believe that we offer more 
substance than most theatrical releases. We have no more or less 
headline-driven films than before. Some can make sense dramatically, others 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: Sunday night -- entire family; Monday night -- women. "Because of 
ESPN football, which attracts a lot of male viewers, and Fox, which has a lot 
of younger viewers, Sunday night is starting to look like the Monday-night 
configuration," Masucci says. "There's no point in trying to get the male 
audience away from football." 
</P>
<P>
Fox -- Philosophy: "We want to offer movies that are very distinguishable from 
the normal TV fare on other networks," says Lawrence A. Jones, president of FNM 
Co. (for Fox Night at the Movies). "We'll have concept comedies, black 
comedies, compelling dramas, Hitchcock-like thrillers and action-adventures. We 
may re-make some old 20th Century Fox movies." 
</P>
<P>
FNM, which is owned by Fox Inc., the same company that owns Fox Broadcasting, 
will broadcast its first production Nov. 26, "Working Trash," a comedy about 
two janitors (George Carlin, Ben Stiller) who work in a Wall Street brokerage 
firm and get rich by reading what other people throw out. 
</P>
<P>
Audience: 18-34 males and females. 
</P>
<P>
PBS -- "American Playhouse" philosophy: "In the past, we've made a lot of 
personal films that have been very narrow in their point of view," says 
executive producer Lindsay Law, whose series returns in March. "Frankly, we're 
shifting to stronger plots and more universal themes. We have done a lot of 
enjoyable short fiction. We'll be less gentle than we used to be. We're doing 
fewer historical pieces and more stories that illuminate the world now. We also 
have an enormous focus on multicultural programming, telling stories about 
gays, blacks, Hispanics and Asians." Audience: 30s-40s male and female. 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderworks" philosophy: "We're a literature-based series," says senior 
executive producer Jay Rayvid. "We deal with rites-of-passage stories with 
heroes or heroines from 7 through to late teens. They always learn something. 
Our product must be able to be aired on daytime. We have some similarities with 
the Disney Channel, but they do things that don't fit our genre." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: families. 
</P>
<P>
Disney Channel -- Philosophy: "Our stories are about families that find 
themselves in adversity -- usually some kind of social, political or economic 
conflict -- and how they rise above it," Disney Channel President John F. Cooke 
says. "There is always a teen, pre-teen or young adult in the setting, and 
there is an interrelationship between mothers, fathers and children. The focus 
tends to be on people finding themselves and building character. We've been 
very successful with period pieces, but we also have contemporary subjects." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: families. 
</P>
<P>
Family Channel -- Philosophy: "Our movies are character-driven, with people 
standing up and doing the right thing," reports Paul Krimsier, vice president 
of programming. "In our Thanksgiving movie, 'Clarence,' Robert Carradine plays 
the angel from 'It's a Wonderful Life,' who comes back to Earth and has another 
adventure. One of our goals is that people should feel good after watching 
them. They're not just escapism. They should make you think. They aren't so 
unique that they couldn't appear elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: families. 
</P>
<P>
HBO -- The pay-cable company has two divisions making TV movies: HBO Pictures 
and HBO Showcase. "I think of HBO Pictures as Broadway and HBO Showcase as 
off-Broadway," says Colin Callender, executive producer of HBO Showcase. 
</P>
<P>
HBO Showcase Philosophy: "We tell stories never told anywhere else or we tell 
them in a different way," says Callender, who'll turn out six films this 
season. "We're trying to break the rules in terms of content, form and 
execution. We want to do work that entertains but challenges. I have a brief 
that doesn't require me to deliver massive ratings. If a project could have 
been done by someone else, I don't want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Lockerbie,' coming in December, is not a narrative drama focusing on one 
character. Instead, we're saying the Pan Am 103 tragedy could have been averted 
if the people doing their jobs actually did their jobs. We haven't 
fictionalized anything. 
</P>
<P>
Audience: couples rather than families, "people who have found the sort of 
material they enjoy in less commercial parts of the cinema and theater." 
</P>
<P>
HBO Pictures Philosophy: "We seek out interesting stories, and part of that is 
they're controversial," says senior vice president Robert Cooper, who has 10 
movies on his agenda. "We don't want to be PBS, but we also don't want to be 
NBC. We can tackle political and controversial issues others are not willing to 
tackle. 'Judgment' (coming Oct.13) is based on the true story of a couple in 
Louisiana whose child was molested by a priest while in a church day-care 
center. The networks have dealt with child molestation, but have they dealt 
with the Catholic Church? 
</P>
<P>
"We put risky material in the hands of experienced filmmakers, often feature 
film directors. Nudity will be included if it's an integral part of the story. 
Our shooting schedules are at least 30 days, compared to the average 17-21 days 
for a TV movie." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: over 21. 
</P>
<P>
Lifetime -- Philosophy: "We strive to be the network (that) women will turn to 
first," says Melinda Fishman, vice president of original movies, "so we'll 
present material (that is) female in sensibility. Actresses are very responsive 
to what we want to air. 'Storm and Sorrow' (airing in November), a true story 
about rock climber Molly Higgins, who takes part in an ice-climbing expedition 
in Russia, had been developed at both ABC and CBS. We worked on it, and it 
became a Lifetime movie." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: women. 
</P>
<P>
Showtime -- Philosophy: "If the movie could be on a commercial network or basic 
cable, we wouldn't be interested," says Steven Hewitt, senior vice president of 
original programming and production. "We'll delve into all kinds of subject 
matter, such as the supernatural, that the networks won't go near. 
</P>
<P>
"We want pictures to look like theatrical motion pictures, and we pay a premium 
for that. We will make action-adventures, psychological thrillers, mysteries, 
comedies, subject matter that delves into nudity. 'Psycho IV' will air in 
November, and we're now making 'Paris Trout' (based on a 1988 National Book 
Award-winning novel about a white man who kills a black girl and how his life 
disintegrates, starring Dennis Hopper, Ed Harris and Barbara Hershey). We give 
writers more freedom to explore subject matter, plus movies don't have to be 
designed for commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"While we're still in our start-up mode, we'll comb theatrical movies for 
unreleased product. 'Fear' (which aired last season with Ally Sheedy) was on 
the shelf. Subscribers don't care where a movie came from. We're practical and 
realistic: If we can find something that's original and has never been seen, 
we'll show it. But we'd love to get to the place where we produce all our 
movies." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: over 21. 
</P>
<P>
TNT -- Philosophy: "We're developing a good niche for up-market movies," Scott 
Sassa, executive vice president of programming, says. "Ted Turner's philosophy 
is to do things designed to enlighten and inform rather than pander to the 
lowest common denominator. However, we don't want to become a soap box. Barbara 
Cartland movies are my idea of the edge of the envelope. I prefer 'Young 
Catherine' or 'Chernobyl: The Final Warning' or 'Orpheus Descending,' the movie 
version of the Broadway play. That's really out there. 
</P>
<P>
"Ted's tastes are more Middle American than you might expect. He doesn't read 
scripts, so I run all movie concepts by him in a monthly half-hour meeting. We 
go into development with 4-6 movies a month. There is no project Ted has ever 
said no to if we really wanted to do it. There are four of us who make 
decisions, and if one of us likes a project enough, it'll probably go. Ted 
says, 'If everybody agrees, maybe we'll be producing movies that are watered 
down.' " 
</P>
<P>
Audience: No particular demographic target. 
</P>
<P>
USA Network -- Philosophy: "We do movies that are pure entertainment," says 
senior vice president of programming Dave Kenin, whose channel airs new movies 
every other Wednesday night. "They're essentially mystery movies ('Web of 
Deceit,' 'Nightmare on the 13th Floor'). Usually when you hear the description, 
you can begin to anticipate. There's not a lot of teaching in our movies. 
They're not going to appeal to critics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same approach as the networks to sex and nudity, although our 
language has been more restrictive. This fall we're looking to see if we're too 
prudish." 
</P>
<P>
Audience: adults, young adults. 
</P>

<P>
PBS REVS UP ITS SCHEDULE TO NAB VIEWERS FOR NEW FALL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
No longer content to passively see viewers tune out and watch cable, PBS has 
decided to ag gressively counterprogram. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as the four networks were airing the season premieres of new and 
returning series, PBS devoted its prime-time schedule to one show: Ken Burns' 
11-hour documentary "The Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, public TV kicks off its fall season with a potpourri of new and 
returning series and specials entitled "Showcase Week." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a celebration," said Jennifer Lawson, executive vice president for 
programming and promotional services. "It's not so much a sampling of all you 
can see on PBS, but a sampling of some of the best we traditionally have. We 
deliberately highlighted these programs because we wanted viewers to know that 
if they like these shows, there are more where these are coming from." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson admitted PBS doesn't have the viewership it would like. "Like the 
networks, we have been affected by the drop in viewership overall and the 
increased competitive nature of what viewers have available (to watch)," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our numbers have dropped slightly. All of our activities are designed in part 
to help reverse that trend and more importantly, it is just a part of our new 
approach in trying to make people aware of public TV and what it has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
To heighten awareness of "Showcase Week," PBS is airing commercials on its 
competition. "We want the voice of public TV there as well," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off the week is the season premiere of "Nature," and the Harold Pinter 
drama "The Heat of the Day," the season opener of "Masterpiece Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Winfield, a familiar face on PBS ("American Playhouse" and "Wonderworks") 
hosts "Showcase Week." 
</P>
<P>
While cable's Arts &amp; Entertainment Network and Discovery Channel still 
acquire a majority of their programs from England, Australia and Canada, PBS 
has decreased its number of imports. "We have made a conscious effort over the 
last 10 years to put far more of our resources into our own productions," 
Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our intent behind the creation of 'American Playhouse,' 
'Wonderworks,' 'American Masters,' and 'The American Experience.' 
</P>
<P>
"At one point, someone said we may have too many series that are entitled 
'American something,' " she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Another "American" series, "American Pie," is set to air during the winter. 
"It's an anthology magazine series from all over the country that highlights 
local vignettes, the uniquely regional quality of America," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, PBS stations would individually purchase the programs that made up 
the PBS schedule. "That put PBS in a passive position of just scheduling what 
the stations collectively decided to buy," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
That is why each local station can choose to air PBS programs at different 
times or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
PBS hopes to achieve uniform scheduling sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
The network is banking that in some cases viewers would rather watch a special 
multipart series such as "The Civil War" over an entire week instead of airing 
one episode a week over several months. When a series is extended over a period 
of time, viewership tends to drop. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting the series on during a week, there is a greater likelihood viewers who 
find it compelling material will come back to it," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>

A STORY WITH EVERYTHING -- THE VON BULOWS; 
</P>
<P>
SUNNY AND CLAUS HAD IT ALL -- AND NOW THERE'S A MOVIE ABOUT THEIR ARISTOCRATIC 
LIVES AND TRAGIC CONFLICT. HOW DOES HOLLYWOOD MAKE A FILM ABOUT THESE 
STILL-LIVING PEOPLE? VERY CAREFULLY.

' "This case has everything,' declared the prosecutor. 'It has money, sex, 
drugs; it has Newport (Rhode Island), New York and Europe; it has nobility; it 
has maids, butlers, a gardener. . . . This case is where the little man has a 
chance to glimpse inside and see how the rich live.' " 
</P>
<P>
From its opening lines, Harvard Law professor Alan M. Dershowitz's book 
"Reversal of Fortune: Inside the Von Bulow Case," written in 1986, read like a 
breathless invitation to do the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he quoted an unnamed commentator who called the case "an epic drama," or 
a vehicle that would have "made Cecil B. De Mille proud, with its plots and 
subplots, major and minor characters, days of nail-biting tension and periods 
of comic relief." 
</P>
<P>
And if a producer hadn't quite leaped to the phone, Dershowitz wrote a bit 
later in the book that "a legal case is somewhat like a long unedited film 
containing thousands of frames, only a small portion of which ultimately appear 
on the screen . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Dershowitz, of course, also provided a list of dramatis personae starting with 
Claus von Bulow, the aloof Danish-born aristocrat accused of twice trying to 
murder his wife Martha (Sunny) von Bulow by injecting her with insulin and 
twice tried for the alleged crime. In the first trial in 1982, Von Bulow was 
found guilty. In the second trial in 1985, which he won on appeal, he was 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Dershowitz, who built a national reputation as a civil liberties lawyer with 
clients like Patty Hearst, Anatoly Scharansky and a number of inmates on death 
row -- he's currently handling the tax-evasion appeal of Leona Helmsley -- 
represented Von Bulow on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes "Reversal of Fortune" -- the movie -- starring Glenn Close as Sunny, 
heir to a utilities fortune that at the time of her second, irreversible coma 
in December, 1980, was approaching $100 million; Jeremy Irons as her second 
husband, Von Bulow, and Ron Silver as Dershowitz. The movie -- an Edward R. 
Pressman Production for Warner Bros. and directed by Barbet Schroeder 
("Barfly") -- has been the hit of both the Telluride and Toronto film festivals 
and opens nationally Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
It's a most unusual movie -- all of the principals are alive, though the 
heroine/victim remains in a coma -- that has been inspected scrupulously by 
lawyers on all sides, according to the filmmakers. Yet they also admit to the 
use of dramatic license, a mix of fact and fiction, in portraying a 
much-publicized case that seemed destined for filming from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
However Dershowitz, who plays a Rhode Island Supreme Court Judge in the movie 
(without lines), insists the thought of a picture deal did not occur to him 
until his older son Elon read the book manuscript and said, " 'Hey, this is a 
movie.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dershowitz's son, now 29, took his father's book to his boss, producer 
Pressman, and is now a co-producer on the film. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea about any movie," the author says. "It was just that obviously I 
wanted people to read the book and to make people read a book you talk about 
its popular aspect. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a very specific goal . . . to illustrate how due process can really work 
to free an innocent person. Generally, it works to free guilty people, and here 
was a case where all these constitutional rights had turned around a verdict 
and had actually proved (someone) innocent, and that's the theme of the book . 
. . It's hard to put that into a movie. It's much easier said in 300 pages than 
in 100 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
"But you do come away with a sense that here was a man who was falsely 
accused," he added. "And you understand why. Because he is an enigmatic 
character. There's one scene where he screams at me because he says 
</P>
<P>
I wear my emotions on my sleeve and he doesn't . . . He's a cold Dane, and I'm 
a warm-bodied Jew, and our worlds just don't mesh, and that provides some real 
interest in the movie" -- as it had in the book. 
</P>
<P>
Yet liberties were taken with Dershowitz's character as well. "It's not me as I 
know myself," said Dershowitz last week with a laugh, but he nevertheless 
deemed the movie "terrific." "The opening scene has me throwing a telephone on 
the floor. I have never done that in my life . . . " 
</P>
<P>
As "Reversal of Fortune" screenwriter Nicholas Kazan puts it, the movie is "not 
docudrama; it's not documentary. Probably a good name for it would be some kind 
of fiction based on fact." 
</P>
<P>
The role of late author Truman Capote, who figures prominently in Dershowitz's 
book -- Capote told Dershowitz that Sunny had told him that she injected 
herself with a mixture of Demerol and amphetamines -- has been trimmed from the 
movie for time's sake, though he rates a mention. "He was a wonderful 
character," muses Kazan. "I'm really very sorry to lose him. He's dead, so you 
can say whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
Kazan sees Von Bulow as someone who "reeks of guilt -- but that doesn't mean he 
tried to kill his wife . . . . He may have tried to kill his wife but not in 
the manner alleged by the prosecution. I don't mean that he did try to kill his 
wife. I'm saying that no one knows." 
</P>
<P>
When a fact-based project goes to Hollywood, Dershowitz knows, it can quickly 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"When I gave the book over to my son," Dershowitz said a few months ago, "I 
realized that I was losing control over it, it was no longer my product. It was 
now his product, Kazan's product, Schroeder's product. Obviously, if I did it, 
I would have done it differently, but I'm not in the movie business. I would 
have made it much more documentary, very very limited to the facts . . . . But 
whenever you've written something and you give that up to a filmmaker, you're 
taking a little bit of a risk. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm a risk taker. I don't live in the shadows." 
</P>
<P>
Elon Dershowitz, who has sidelined as a professional magician, had been 
Pressman's driver in Los Angeles when he first read his father's book. Besides 
co-producing "Reversal of Fortune" with Kazan, he shares rights to the book 
with his brother Jamin Dershowitz, 27, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society in 
New York City. "I drove (Pressman) around in his little car," Elon recalled on 
the film's set last September. "I had the galleys. And I said, 'Ed, I'd like to 
give you first look because I work for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Six months into the job, and he had a manuscript," Pressman elaborated. "I 
sort of inquisitively looked at it and was immediately absorbed. I had always 
had a real fascination with the world of the American aristocracy. I had 
enjoyed the books of Lewis Auchincloss and Edith Wharton, and to see that 
world, not 'Dynasty' or 'Dallas,' but Newport, was something that was very 
interesting to me. 
</P>
<P>
"And then the actual legal process," added Pressman, whose recent projects 
included "Blue Steel," Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" and "Talk Radio" (Stone is 
a producer on this movie as well). "I had known about trials and such through 
films like 'The Verdict' and 'Witness for the Prosecution,' but this book gave 
me a perspective which was more authentic and realistic . . . ." Pressman 
called it "a cinematic idea" to do a movie about investigative lawyers "in the 
way 'All the President's Men' approached its subject" about investigative 
reporters. 
</P>

Kazan, whose screenplays include "Patty Hearst" and "At Close Range," was also 
drawn by the saga of the rich. He is descended on his mother's side from 
generations of "crusty New England lawyers (and) a great-great grandfather who 
was president of Yale." And he is the son of director Elia Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder was drawn to the story because "it deals with evil. Ever since I made 
the movie 'Idi Amin' (1974), it has been one of my concentrations . . . . 
Aaaah, the thing is that we don't really know where the evil is. Evil is 
omnipresent, it's everywhere. There are all kinds of possible evils, all kinds 
of hypotheses. Did he do it or did the (adult) children (by Sunny's first 
marriage) frame him? And is this man evil, or is it evil to let an evil man go 
free?" 
</P>
<P>
It is Christmas week, 1979. Sunny sits chain smoking furiously in a four-poster 
bed with separate mattresses. A bandanna over his eyes, Claus pretends to be 
asleep, until she picks a fight. Bottles of pills are visible on her night 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Claus, trained as a lawyer whose last job was as an assistant to J. Paul Getty 
in London, yearns to work, but Sunny doesn't want him to. "At your age it's 
perfectly acceptable to retire," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already retired," he replies. "I haven't worked full time since Getty." 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly. This is your ego," she says angrily. "You never had a career. Not 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have one now," Claus says. "Come on, Sunny, your father worked. 
You want the children to grow up thinking the male's place is in a deck chair?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You marry me for my money and then demand to work?" she hurls at him before 
bringing up the matter of his mistress. "You're the prince of perversion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Prince of perversion? 
</P>
<P>
"What she's saying at a direct level (in that scene)," Kazan explains, "is that 
he has all the money in the world and he wants to work? Beyond that his whole 
attitude toward life, he relishes things which other people consider to be 
perverse . . . . He has a certain iconography around his house which suggests 
that he may not be a sadomasochist but he may like to tease people into 
thinking he is." 
</P>
<P>
Close apparently found the idea that Von Bulow may have sat and watched his 
wife's struggle particularly chilling. "It was the next morning when Maria 
(Schrallhammer, Sunny's personal maid) says she heard moaning and accused 
(Claus) of not calling the doctor," she said, "and he said she was just 
sleeping everything off, and finally about six in the evening she went into 
(Close imitates a heavy choking sound). Her heart stopped. " 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Close had met the real Claus von Bulow. "He's very charismatic 
-- and kind of scary-looking," she said. "When I was married, we lived on Fifth 
Avenue, and we went to some of (the same) dinner parties. I never sat at his 
table. He's very, very tall, and he always had a flock of people around him, 
and basically was always holding court. It was during the (second) trial . . . 
I was very put off by it actually. And I was very put off by the fact that all 
these people were flocking around him. It was very much like 'Bonfire of the 
Vanities.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sunny von Bulow emerged from her first coma in 1979 with last-minute 
ministrations by her physician. A year later she went into the second coma. For 
nearly 10 years, she has remained at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in 
New York. According to Maureen Connelly, a family spokeswoman, "the correct 
terminology is that she's in a 'persistent vegetative state.' " 
.................... 
</P>
<P>
The case divided Sunny's children. Annie-Laurie (Ala) Kneissl (now Ala Isham) 
and Alexander von Auersperg, the children from her first marriage to Austrian 
Prince Alfred von Auersperg, insisted that their stepfather was guilty. Cosima 
von Bulow, a teen-ager then, stood with her father. 
</P>
<P>
As "Reversal of Fortune" went into production, her older children, who had also 
tried to suppress Dershowitz' book, apparently got hold of a copy of Kazan's 
script. Pressman said the children "had a couple of objections . . . We've been 
basically very careful in not doing anything that would be legally incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Ala about changes," noted Connelly, "and she said she and her brother 
objected to the way their mother was portrayed. She said they suggested changes 
but has no idea whether they were incorporated or not." 
</P>
<P>
She said Ala called the film " 'a gross exploitation of my mother. People are 
seeking to profit from her tragedy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Connelly added that both Von Auersperg children, who founded the National 
Victim Center and the Sunny von Bulow Coma and Head Trauma Research Foundation 
in their mother's name, consider the movie "another example of a trend that 
goes against victim's rights, that victims are exploited in the courtroom and 
then they are exploited in books and movies . . . . They don't want to continue 
a public fight. They want to get on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Connelly has not seen "Reversal of Fortune," though she said she asked Warner 
Communications about attending 
</P>
<P>
an advance screening. She added that Ala and her brother are "distressed" about 
the upcoming movie, "but as Ala said, 'we faced a lot worse than this in the 
last 10 years.' 
</P>
<P>
Pressman insists his movie "won't do damage to the memory of Sunny. Certainly 
in comparison to what we read in the press and see on the news at the time, her 
image is almost heroic and will be significantly enhanced by the film. A lot of 
the film is from her perspective." 
</P>
<P>
"Reversal of Fortune" focuses on the appeal process and Dershowitz's use of 
teams of junior colleagues and law students to unravel puzzles in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, Von Bulow hired Dershowitz several weeks after the jury rendered 
its guilty verdict. He was sentenced to 30 years, but was granted $1-million 
bail pending appeal. Two years later, on April 27, 1984, the Rhode Island 
Supreme Court reversed the conviction on grounds that a private investigator's 
notes were not made available to the defense, and police violated the federal 
and Rhode Island constitutions by failing to obtain a search warrant before 
testing drugs from a black shaving bag found in Von Bulow's closet. 
</P>
<P>
In the retrial, led by former "Abscam" prosecutor Thomas Puccio, who also used 
evidence gathered by Dershowitz' team, the defense argued the comas were most 
likely caused by combinations of alcohol, drugs, low body temperature and 
choking on vomit -- not injection by insulin. On June 10, 1985, Von Bulow was 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing his script, Kazan went beyond Dershowitz's book. He also used 
Dershowitz's 100-page appeals brief in preparing his script -- "crammed pages 
full of footnotes and so forth, filled with all kinds of human details" -- as 
well as the reply briefs. He watched Claus on two Barbara Walters' interviews 
after each trial, and read transcripts of the first trial, as well as 2,000 
pages of Claus' deposition in response to a civil suit that had been filed 
against him by the Von Auersperg children. And Kazan researched material 
purporting to tell the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Kazan said he "elaborated" on dialogue and character, though not on actual 
events other than for dramatic compression. 
</P>
<P>
Claus was "easy to embellish because he's kind of a rococo figure," said Kazan. 
"His sense of himself -- 'What do you give a wife who has everything? An 
injection of insulin' -- it's like that these jokes he (repeats) so frequently 
give you a sense of play which is exciting, comic and terrifying 
simultaneously. . . . The trick with Claus is everyone sees him as being kind 
of devilish, and part of my job was to make him a human being also . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"With Sunny," Kazan continued, "I have affidavits about her falling down in 
public parties, and drinking and smearing lipstick all over her face. These are 
depositions which Claus got from people in Newport for the appeal. Then there 
was Claus' civil deposition. One has to look at that with a certain amount of 
skepticism but he's not lying for 2,000 pages. 
</P>
<P>
"So the trick is to take everything . . . her pattern of self-destruction -- 
all the pills, aspirin constantly, up to 20 laxatives a day, chain smoking 
cigarettes three or four packs a day, this woman was really on a collision 
course, and she stayed in bed constantly. And you also want to present a human 
being you're sympathetic to. This person lived. This person cared about her 
children. I tried to make a portrait of someone who was trapped in her life." 
</P>
<P>
Still there were constraints. "Working on the script was a nightmare from a 
legal standpoint," noted Kazan, "because the assumption is everyone's going to 
come out of the woodwork, everyone is going to sue, and a lot of the people who 
are going to sue are very rich. Every time there was a revision we had to go to 
the lawyers. If an actor had a problem with a line, you'd rewrite the line and 
go the lawyers, then the lawyers would send it to the insurance agent." 
</P>
<P>
How do you make a movie about a woman in a coma? Even taking into account the 
"flashbacks," Glenn Close said her character is really the movie's "leitmotif" 
-- her role was shot in the first three weeks of production -- while "certainly 
in size of roles, Jeremy and Ron Silver are carrying the weight of the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder enjoyed the contrast in their characters. "I see (Von Bulow) as 
totally amoral and pleasure-loving, who's bored to death when he's with his 
wife, but who has a lot of fun when he's in trouble. Nothing matters 
ultimately. Nothing has any importance. That's a very unusual character. And 
what I liked was the confrontation between those two -- Dershowitz and him. And 
that's the heart of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course basically you have the idea also of life versus death," continued 
the director, "because the surrounding of Von Bulow in his big house is very 
cold, and the surrounding of Dershowitz is all these young students and that is 
very exciting too. Von Bulow has a dandy libertine detached view of the world. 
On the contrary, for Dershowitz, justice is almost like a religion. Things do 
matter, even if it's for the idea of justice to free someone that maybe is not 
completely innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Not completely innocent? "The possibility of his guilt has to be there; 
otherwise the movie doesn't work dramatically," Schroeder said. Not that he 
injected his wife with insulin for "that charge was completely ludicrous," but 
that Von Bulow is "somehow responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps guilty, he suggested reluctantly, "of having collaborated with his wife 
in order to have her die. She may have (attempted to) committed suicide and he 
may have facilitated that." 
</P>
<P>
And Kazan pointed out that "there is considerable evidence, if you read the 
book, that Sunny was suicidal. Three weeks before the final coma Sunny took 65 
aspirins." Dershowitz suggests that Von Bulow was "frozen with indecision" 
about calling the doctor at the time of the first coma because "he doesn't know 
how sick she is, the maid is saying, 'Call the doctor.' He's saying, 'She 
wouldn't want me to call the doctor, she doesn't like invasion of her privacy, 
she doesn't like the doctors in Newport, don't worry she's done this before.' 
And then in retrospect it was much worse than he thought. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing in the second coma. He learned from the first coma that he had 
been wrong and he called immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his acquittal Von Bulow told Dershowitz he thought Robert Duvall 
ought to play him in the movie, which Dershowitz duly reported in the book. Now 
living in England and according to Dershowitz doing charitable work, Von Bulow 
played no role in the making of "Reversal of Fortune." One of the stipulations 
between him and Sunny's older children in settling the civil suit was that he 
maintain silence on the case. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dershowitz did confide, going into an ever-so-slight imitation of his 
client's voice, " 'You know, I'm not allowed to talk about this film, and I'm 
as anxious as any subject would be.' 
</P>
<P>
"He's heard very good things about Jeremy," Dershowitz added. "He was just a 
bit concerned Jeremy Irons didn't have his accent right. He said Jeremy Irons 
has never been to Oxford or Cambridge."

A MANY-FACETED FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before it was finally seen by festival audiences at the Telluride and Toronto 
film festivals recently, "Reversal of Fortune" was being touted 
schizophrenically as a "suspenseful fact-based courtroom drama" and "a 
delicious, ironic social comedy of manners." As those audiences discovered, it 
is both. 
</P>
<P>
Though the film has at its chilly core an aristocratic and seemingly icy-veined 
Claus von Bulow (played by Jeremy Irons), and is narrated by his permanently 
comatose wife Sunny (Glenn Close), the movie couldn't be less moribund. The 
liveliest and funniest moments come with a third character, Von Bulow's 
attorney, Alan Dershowitz (Ron Silver), during his sometimes tense, often arch 
consultations with his exact opposite of a client. 
</P>
<P>
Working with a strong, heavily researched script by Nicholas Kazan, director 
Barbet Schroeder has boldly chosen four different styles for "Reversal": 
docudrama, with flat lighting and source music from radios for the legal 
defense strategizing sequences; high drama, with overtly cinematic lighting and 
original music for the subjective, not necessarily truthful "flashbacks" of 
life between Claus and Sunny; black comedy, with macabre quips flying back and 
forth between Von Bulow and Dershowitz; and, finally, spiritual fantasy in 
those moments when narrator Sunny, her cinematic spirit hovering over her 
vegetating body, introduces herself and other characters. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing the film, audiences at Telluride were hung on whether they 
believed Von Bulow guilty of murder -- as Schroeder had hoped. "Von Bulow is a 
character who enjoys cultivating the idea of his own guilt," said the director. 
"So I did a little bit of the same, in a very perverse way, leaving all options 
open all the time. I felt like Von Bulow himself, as a director." CHRIS WILLMAN

JUMP START; JAPAN COMES TO THE HEARTLAND BY DAVID GELSANLITER (FARRAR, STRAUS 
&amp; GIROUX: $19.95; 214 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Tasini, Tasini writes about labor from New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning of "Jump Start," David Gelsanliter raises a series of 
questions. Among them: Are the Japanese saving the American auto industry and 
"restoring our faith in the American worker," and will American labor be able 
to organize Japanese plants in the United State? 
</P>
<P>
To find the answers, Gelsanliter looks at the Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., 
the Nissan plant in Smyrna, Tenn., and Honda's factory in Marysville, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing three stories was the author's first mistake. He correctly focuses on 
the economic cost, such as tax breaks that small towns accord in luring the 
Japanese -- or any employer. But he gets bogged down in reciting mind-numbing 
details of the negotiations between local communities and the Japanese 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The author, whose background is primarily in newspaper management, obviously is 
enamored of the Japanese and their system of kaizen (continuous improvement). 
In Japan, he says, "workers arrive early and stay late." We learn that American 
auto workers can only accomplish 80% of what Japanese auto workers, dashing 
around the plant, can do in the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Gelsanliter clearly thinks all this is good. Well, is it really? He makes no 
mention of the growing discontent among Japanese workers over the exhausting 
pace of work and their quality of life. Such absences undermine the book's 
authority and credibility. 
</P>
<P>
The author says the success of "Japanese auto makers in the United States will 
depend on how well they can blend their culture with ours." Yet this book is 
too superficial to give the reader a feel for either culture, Japanese or 
American working class, except in the most stereotypical manner -- the Japanese 
work hard; American workers are lazy. American workers speak only briefly and 
generally to reinforce the author's contention that they love working under the 
Japanese management system. 
</P>
<P>
The book's central failing, however, is that Gelsanliter does not capture the 
pulse of any of the three plants he writes about. "Quality circles," a central 
component of the vaunted Japanese tema concept in which workers discuss 
problems, is explained in one sentence. Gelsanliter recognizes the quickening 
pace on the assembly line but gives short shrift to the extensive evidence of 
severe injuries and trauma at the Nissan and Honda plants. 
</P>
<P>
So when the author concludes that "another generation is finding better jobs in 
the auto industry without having to leave home," he has not made his case and 
he is simply wrong.

WHO OWNS YOSEMITE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maura Dolan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chain of low hills began to rise. Moving plates beneath the earth's crust 
pushed them skyward. They climbed imperceptibly at first, fractions of an inch 
over centuries. On the western flank of the central range, a river accelerated 
into a torrent. The crashing water cut a narrow, V-shaped canyon out of the 
granite. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three million years passed. An icecap enshrouded the summit of the 
range. Tongues of ice streamed down into the canyon. The ice thickened. It 
pushed and ground against the canyon walls and polished the granite domes. More 
glaciers came. They scoured the canyon into a U-shaped valley, about a mile 
wide and seven miles long. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheets and blocks of rocks broke loose from the valley's granite sides. The 
falling rocks deepened the cliffs into abruptly rising walls. Sculpted spires, 
crevices and alcoves appeared. Waterfalls leaped over the recesses. During the 
past 10,000 years, the river filled the glacial lakes with sediment and gravel. 
Seeds blew in. And shimmering flower-sprinkled meadows grew, bordered by the 
towering, sheer walls of rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Man arrived about 3,000 years ago; from where, nobody is certain. He hunted 
deer and burned fires but left few enduring scars. And then descendants of 
European settlers discovered the wondrous valley, and the wars over Yosemite 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE a special year for Yosemite National Park. It turns 
100 tomorrow, and festivities and fanfare will mark the milestone. But a nasty, 
raging battle threatens to overshadow the entire centennial. It is a 
late-breaking skirmish in a classic American conflict: use versus preservation 
in the nation's wild lands. This time, the battle lines have been drawn over a 
park concessioner's contract. And the prize is the heart of Yosemite, the 
seven-mile-long Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the high season, from a ledge halfway up the valley cliffs, the conflict is 
clear. Majestic granite walls, carved and sculpted over eons, tower overhead. 
Half Dome looms in the distance. But look downward, and Yosemite Valley might 
be taken for a suburban subdivision. The baby-blue tint of a large swimming 
pool catches the eye first; then dozens of brown buildings and white tent 
cabins compete for attention. Cars and buses sit sandwiched neatly into asphalt 
parking lots, a sea of metal gleaming in the sunlight. A garbage truck passes 
by, its engine loud enough to puncture the mesmerizing thunder of a waterfall 
only a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,300 buildings in Yosemite Valley, plus 30 miles of paved 
roads, eight miles of paved bikeways, 17 acres of asphalt parking lots, a 
vehicle maintenance garage, three swimming pools, a tennis court, an 
ice-skating rink, a jail, a courthouse, a gas station and two warehouses. To a 
preservationist, the roar of traffic and the stretch of development are 
intrusions. To a concessioner,the garbage trucks, parking lots and swimming 
pools are the price that must be paid if visitors are to enjoy comfortable 
access to the park. 
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the biggest concessioner contract in Yosemite goes up for grabs. The 
Yosemite Park and Curry Co. -- owned by MCA Inc., the entertainment giant that 
brought you "Jaws" and "Back to the Future I," "II" and "III" -- must negotiate 
to renew its for-profit hold on most of the buildings and many of the services 
in Yosemite, including the Ahwahnee Hotel and Yosemite Lodge. In the running 
against MCA will most likely be a nonprofit organization formed by 
conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
The conservationists want nothing less than MCA's ouster from the park. The 
terms of the new contract, they say, should mandate fewer hotel rooms, fewer 
cars, fewer parking spaces and less of everything that isn't "natural" in 
Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
But the contract is just a symbol of the contention at Yosemite. The real 
conflict is about power and who will wield it. As the park's 100th anniversary 
kicks off, the balance of power is clear: The advantage lies not with the 
National Park Service, the agency nominally in charge, nor with the 
preservationists, the self-styled defenders of nature. The advantage in the 
battle brewing in Yosemite Valley lies with the Curry Co. and MCA, the 
corporation that makes millions of dollars off the most scenic valley in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
SEATED AROUND A TABLE in the dining room of Yosemite's luxurious Ahwahnee Hotel 
several years ago, two government bureaucrats from Washington watched in 
fascination as Edward Hardy, president of the Yosemite Park and Curry Co., held 
court. The federal officials had come to Yosemite to go over the park's budget 
with Robert Binnewies, then park superintendent. "We had not asked to meet with 
the concessioner, but before we knew it, he was around us and we were around 
him," remembers one of the bureaucrats. "They definitely wined and dined us. Ed 
was a wonderful host." 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service, the legal caretaker and administrator of Yosemite, should 
have been running the show. Theoretically, the Park Service has complete 
control over the concession. It writes and awards the contract under which the 
concession operates, determines how much the concession pays for the right to 
operate in the park, and decides what the concession can and cannot do. It also 
must approve the prices the concession charges in its stores and for its rooms, 
and the addition of each new vending machine and profit-making center in the 
park. The Park Service even has the final word over the decor in the 
concession's accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
But to the two Washington bureaucrats, Ed Hardy seemed to be in charge at 
Yosemite. He had his ideas about what the park needed, and he was a forceful 
advocate. When he took positions that contradicted those of Binnewies', the 
superintendent fell quiet. In comparison to Hardy, one of the bureaucrats said, 
Binnewies seemed "almost timid. I got the impression that Hardy thought it was 
his park." 
</P>
<P>
More than anyone else, Hardy, 55, a barrel-chested, engaging former Marine, 
personifies the modern-day, MCA-owned Curry Co., and in some eyes, the park 
itself. Congressional staff members who know Hardy call him the "acting 
superintendent of Yosemite." Park superintendents come and go at Yosemite, but 
Hardy is always there, so far outlasting five of them. And he is a man worth 
knowing. A room at the Ahwahnee that might require reservations a year in 
advance may be proffered by Hardy in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
Schooled as a resort manager at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, the Riviera 
Country Club in Pacific Palisades and a Del Webb resort, Hardy came to Yosemite 
in 1974, the year after MCA bought the concession, and found himself in the 
midst of controversy. The corporation had used Yosemite as the setting for a 
television series called "Sierra." MCA crews obtained the Park Service's 
permission to paint a boulder in Yosemite Valley. They also crashed cars into a 
pine tree that had been covered with mattresses hidden under fake bark. 
Although the paint was water-soluble and the tree withstood the impact, 
environmentalists charged that the corporation had defaced a national shrine. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy immediately got to work rebuilding the corporation's image. "I want to 
establish a track record, over a period of time, as the No. 1 environmentally 
concerned company operating in any of the national parks," Hardy told 
Backpacker magazine in 1976. "I really want that image. I need that image." 
</P>
<P>
He went a long way toward improving MCA's reputation in the park. The Curry 
Co., like the largest employer in a company town, is responsible for much of 
what happens in Yosemite Valley. The company owns most of the stores and the 
accommodations, including tent cabins, restaurants and bars. It also rents 
horses, bicycles and rafts, and runs an ice-skating rink during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy hired an environmental consultant and removed from company stores all 
products harmful to the ozone layer. A recycling program was established, and 
the company bear-proofed its garbage cans, dumpsters and food lockers. Early 
on, Hardy even talked about moving 90% of the Curry Co.'s employee housing out 
of Yosemite Valley. He joined the boards of directors of the Yosemite Assn., a 
nonprofit park educational group with conservationist leanings, and the 
Yosemite Fund, a private group that raises money to restore the park. 
</P>
<P>
Someone who has worked with Hardy at the park for many years describes him this 
way: "He has the personality of a bulldog -- very confident, very persistent. 
Someone once called him the great seducer. He is a very smooth P. R. guy. When 
you go into his office, he flatters you and treats you like you're his 
long-lost brother. Then when you're leaving, he opens this little cabinet where 
he keeps his goodies and gives you a couple of free books." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy, after agreeing to an interview, followed the script. He opened the door 
of his Yosemite Village office and beamed. "Thank you for coming," he said, as 
though the meeting had been his idea. He wore tan trousers and a casual, 
long-sleeved shirt. Seated below portraits of David and Jennie Curry, the 
schoolteachers who founded the original Curry Co. in 1899, Hardy was congenial, 
complimentary and quick to withdraw an opinion if it seemed to offend. At the 
end of the interview, right on schedule, he walked over to a cabinet and pulled 
out a gift: a videotape about Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy's commanding presence at the park stems in part from his clout in 
Washington. Park Service budgets that determine what is funded in a national 
park -- and hence what happens in a park -- are decided by Congress. The Park 
Service and its parent agency, the Interior Department, are run by political 
appointees susceptible to political influence. To ensure Congress and the 
Administration know their needs, concessioners are represented in Washington by 
the Conference of National Park Concessioners. 
</P>
<P>
Individual concessioners also do their own lobbying, and one of the most 
effective lobbyists is Hardy. Those who know him in Washington say he manages 
to depict the interests of his company as the needs of Yosemite, and he shows a 
great love for the park. "I don't know of anybody who didn't like the man," 
said Ira Whitlock, a former congressional liaison in the National Park 
Service's Washington headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
So influential is Hardy that he managed in 1986 to obtain a $1.2-million 
congressional appropriation for utilities for a new Curry Co. employee 
dormitory in Yosemite Valley -- when the financially strapped Park Service was 
skimping on maintenance of trails, campgrounds and restrooms. Hardy could make 
such company needs known to congressmen in informal settings. He hosted 
lawmakers on company-paid, mule-pack trips to the high country. Former Rep. 
Tony Coelho (D-Merced), one of Hardy's guests on these trips, obtained the 
dormitory money through a line-item add-on to the Park Service budget. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, MCA has benefited from the work of Hardy and his staff. 
The number of visitors to Yosemite has jumped from 2.3 million in 1974 to 3.4 
million last year. Accordingly, MCA's profits mushroomed and are estimated at 
$12 million to $17 million a year. The Curry Co. refuses to disclose any 
figures and contends that its profits are actually below average for resorts. 
It does acknowledge, however, that, while amounting to a mere fraction of MCA's 
overall earnings, the Yosemite concession gives the corporation access to one 
of nature's gems. "MCA takes great personal pride in participating in a place 
as world-renowned as Yosemite," a Curry Co. official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 30-year contract MCA acquired in 1973, the Curry Co. pays the federal 
government only .75% of its gross receipts each year. In 1988, the most recent 
year for which figures are available, that equaled $590,000, less than the 
Curry Co. spent that year on its public relations office and advertising, 
according to the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts by preservationists to portray his company as profiteering at 
the expense of the park could unravel all that Hardy has built. He claims that 
environmentalists are being "used" by unnamed outsiders who want a foothold in 
Yosemite when MCA's contract expires. "They want to smear the Curry Co. so they 
can diminish the value of it and get the contract," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hardy does not seem particularly worried that the preservationists will 
succeed. "We have a long track record, we are well-financed and I believe we 
are the right players to be in the next contract," he said. He points to 
accomplishments: an upgrading of concession buildings in the park, 
company-provided nature education programs for visitors and the relocation of 
some company operations, including the reservation office, from Yosemite to 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
He no longer believes that 90% of Curry Co. housing can be moved outside the 
park. (As many as 1,200 Curry Co. employees -- including Hardy -- live in 
Yosemite Valley, a sore point for many preservationists.) Although he foresees 
the possibility of some cutbacks, he insists that most employees must be near 
guests to ensure good service. Moreover, he says, commuting would simply add to 
congestion on park roads. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the next contract, Hardy argues that more accommodations 
should be kept for tour-bus travelers. The Park Service now permits the Curry 
Co. to set aside 18% of its rooms for tour buses. If the Park Service would 
raise this to 22%, Hardy said, there would be 120 fewer cars overnight in the 
parking lots. But, of course, the kind of people who ride tour buses do not 
want to walk 100 yards in the middle of the night for a bathroom, he continued. 
So Hardy would like to replace about 200 of the company's historic tent cabins 
with two-story motel units with baths. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of Hardy's self-assuredness and his considerable plans, he 
occasionally is reminded that he does not call all the shots. After meeting 
with Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., the Park Service's boss, this summer 
to discuss concession contracts, Hardy was approached by Steven Goldstein, a 
longtime and influential aide to Lujan. Hardy made known his displeasure over 
news stories emanating from the Interior Department about Lujan's efforts to 
make concessioners share more of their profits with taxpayers. "Hardy gave 
Steve a steely-eyed look and said coldly, 'I see your name in the paper too 
much,' " related a colleague of Goldstein's who ran into the aide shortly after 
the encounter. " 'I don't want to read your name in the paper in connection to 
this. Can't we work something out without the papers?' " 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein, who will not publicly discuss the incident, was indignant. "I work 
for the secretary of Interior and the President of the United States," he 
replied icily. 
</P>
<P>
HOWARD CHAPMAN was the first Park Service official to be rolled by MCA's clout. 
For 15 years, until his retirement in 1987, the 40-year veteran of the Park 
Service served as director of its western region and was responsible for 
Yosemite. MCA came to the park just as Chapman and other park officials were 
developing a blueprint for Yosemite's future. The document was to set policies 
and goals that the park and its concessioner would have to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said the Park Service in the early 1970s envisioned a plan that would 
stress preservation of the park's natural resources; what he said MCA had in 
mind was a plan that would draw more visitors. 
</P>
<P>
A team of regional park officials led by Chapman met regularly with a team of 
corporate officials from MCA's headquarters in Universal City. As Chapman 
remembers them, the gatherings were at the best unpleasant and at worst 
"downright nasty." 
</P>
<P>
"We found ourselves completely outgunned by the MCA people, who were dead set 
on pursuing the profit motive of their operation," Chapman remembered. One of 
the MCA representatives, an accountant, "hard-lined it all the way. He made us 
feel like we were the ones who were carrying the black hat and trying to keep 
the public from enjoying the park. 
</P>
<P>
"When they were not satisfied with the positions we took," Chapman continued, 
"they would go over our heads to the (Park Service) director in Washington, and 
I'm reasonably sure, they were going over the director's head to the Interior 
secretary." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his meetings with MCA, Chapman said, the corporation wielded 
political influence within the Nixon Administration, and Nixon appointees 
overrode him when MCA balked over provisions in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy, who participated in some of the talks, said he did not go over Chapman's 
head and is not aware of any calls by MCA to circumvent the regional director. 
"Our philosophy has been that we operate with the superintendent at Yosemite," 
he said. Hardy contends that the Park Service told MCA that it might be allowed 
an additional 300 lodgings in Yosemite when the corporation bought the 
concession. After the Park Service made it clear it did not want an expansion, 
he said, MCA settled for replacing some cabins and tent cabins without baths 
with 1974-style motel units with baths. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman takes some consolation in the fact that MCA did not obtain everything 
it sought. He said the entertainment conglomerate wanted, among other things, 
to build an aerial tramway from the valley to Glacier Point (a concept once 
favored by the Park Service and renowned Yosemite photographer Ansel Adams) but 
dropped the idea after Chapman and his team resisted. 
</P>
<P>
But the final plan -- completed in 1974 -- left Chapman bitter. Whatever MCA's 
compromises, one of the options attached to the plan included adding more than 
100 hotel rooms in the valley and replacing tent cabins there with motel units. 
To conservationists and Park Service professionals, who had begun with a goal 
of reduced development, this represented a major defeat. The park already was 
too congested for their taste. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that we had been so knuckled under by MCA that our only salvation 
would be that we would present it to the public, and they would be so outraged 
they would throw it out," Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman was right. Conservationists were furious. They denounced MCA in 
impassioned speeches in Yosemite Village, grabbed the attention of the national 
news media and enlisted support from members of Congress. An assistant Interior 
secretary quickly dumped the master-plan options, saying they "appeared to have 
been written by the concessioner." Government investigations were launched, and 
a congressional report charged that the Curry Co. exercised "undue influence" 
over park matters. Park Service Director Ron Walker, who had been Nixon's 
campaign advance man, resigned under fire. 
</P>
<P>
The episode was emblematic of the difficulty all levels of the Park Service 
encounters when it tries to limit concessioners. "If the park superintendent 
crosses the concessioner, the next thing the concessioner does is escalate it 
to the National Park Service director's office in Washington," said Philip 
Stewart, 66, a retired Park Service official in charge of concessions during 
the Carter Administration. "And if he can't get satisfaction or relief, then he 
elevates it to the next level, to Congress. It's just like a game." 
</P>
<P>
Park Service officials who have crossed concessions have lost their jobs. 
Interior Secretary James Watt, appointed by President Reagan, left little doubt 
about where his sympathies lay. At a 1981 conference of concessioners, Watt 
listened to a complaint from a concessioner upset about the actions of a park 
official. 
</P>
<P>
"If a personality is giving you a problem," Watt told the concessioner, in 
widely quoted remarks, "we're going to get rid of the problem or the 
personality, whichever is faster." Shortly thereafter, a Park Service official 
in Washington who had been at odds with some concessions was removed from his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a revolving door exists between the Park Service and concessions. 
Those in charge of regulating concessions for the Park Service in Washington 
have included former concession employees and a relative of a park 
concessioner. A former Park Service director and former regional park director 
sit on the board of trustees of a corporation that runs three national park 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this, park officials, especially at the superintendent level, where 
most of the concessioner-park action takes place, are hardly expert at dealing 
with corporate negotiators. "In a place like Yosemite, a guy with a forestry 
degree like I have is suddenly dealing with very big and complex business 
issues," said Binnewies, who granted Curry Co. requests for new profit-making 
services when he was Yosemite superintendent from 1979 to 1986. "We pride 
ourselves in thinking we can do the job, but dealing with multimillion-dollar 
corporations should suggest that some good business expertise on the Park 
Service's side of the table would be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
The first master plan debacle prompted the Park Service to hold public hearings 
in the late 1970s to develop a new blueprint for Yosemite. More than $1 million 
was spent, tens of thousands of people testified and Park Service staff pored 
over draft after draft. The Curry Co. had the opportunity to make its case but 
did not exercise inordinate influence. The public, it turned out, wanted less 
development, not more, in Yosemite Valley but tended to favor keeping 
accommodations at their current level. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the new master plan, completed in 1980 and approved by the Park 
Service hierarchy in Washington, called for reducing the number of guest rooms 
in the Valley by 17%. The plan also sought to remove about 370 Park Service and 
Curry Co. buildings and minimize traffic. Visitors without overnight 
reservations would be required to leave their cars at the periphery of the park 
and enter by bus. "The result will be that visitors can step into Yosemite and 
find nature uncluttered by piecemeal stumbling blocks of commercialism, 
machines and fragments of suburbia," the plan promised. 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with many national park master plans, which are not guaranteed 
funding, this one barely got off the ground: Fewer than 75 Park Service and 
Curry Co. buildings came down. The company says the Park Service never formally 
asked it to remove more. Chapman blames resistance from the Curry Co. "You 
would just be worn down over time," he said. "They would stall and put you off. 
You would come back to them, and they would find reasons to throw up a 
roadblock." And without money to reimburse the Curry Co. for buildings it owned 
by contract, Chapman said, "there was always the threat that they would take us 
to court." 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, Binnewies was reassigned and replaced by Jack Morehead, who had earned 
impressive conservationist credentials as superintendent of Everglades National 
Park in Florida. After three years at Yosemite, Morehead commissioned an 
"examination report," or status report, on the 1980 master plan. It argued that 
much of the plan, including the restrictions on accommodations, might no longer 
be realistic. The plan represented 10-year goals, he said, and he wanted the 
public to know why the objectives were not being met. 
</P>
<P>
But Morehead also had grown to consider Ed Hardy a "personal friend" while at 
Yosemite, and the relationship between the two men became a matter of much 
debate after the report was made public. Morehead and Hardy had lunch together 
once a week, often at the Ahwahnee, and Morehead seldom paid for his own meal. 
The two men and their wives dined at each other's homes. Morehead also joined 
Hardy, congressmen and other Curry Co. guests on Hardy's mule-pack trips. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead says that the friendship did not influence his decisions but that if 
he had to do it all over again, he would change one thing: appearances. He 
would have paid for his own meals with Hardy in front of the Ahwahnee waiters. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists had paid little attention to Yosemite in the 1980s. "Yosemite 
wasn't a priority then," one of them said. But Morehead's report lit the fire 
again. Conservationists had assumed that the 1980 plan eventually would be 
enacted once funding became available, so the report stung like a broken 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the public outcry began, Morehead landed a promotion. He moved to 
Washington to oversee concession management, and Michael Finley, a park 
professional who was respected by conservationists, arrived in Yosemite as 
environmentalists were taking aim. 
</P>
<P>
JOE BOLAND GESTURED OUT over the valley from a curbside seat in front of 
Yosemite Lodge. He had to shout to be heard over the rumble of the 
smoke-belching bus idling a few feet away. "What would I like to see done?" he 
asked, his voice hostile. "I would like to see everyone and everything pushed 
out of here for at least 100 years until we get wise enough as a species to 
take care of this place." 
</P>
<P>
Boland, 45, is tall, slender and dead serious. He doesn't like to talk about 
the more likely possibility, that MCA and the Curry Co. will win the new 
contract in Yosemite in 1993. But he confesses to having another fantasy about 
just that prospect. In this fantasy, Boland, a tennis teacher who lives in a 
trailer in Mariposa, imagines that environmentalists become guerrillas, hide in 
the cliffs that surround Yosemite Valley and sneak down each night to attack 
Curry Co. holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Boland is one of three activists leading the charge against MCA. A veteran of 
the 1970s master plan wars, he brings historical perspective to the campaign 
and a sizable collection of documents about MCA's record in Yosemite. He 
considers the Curry Co. under MCA "the enemy," and in 1974 formed an informal 
group called Friends of Yosemite as a platform for speaking out about the park. 
</P>
<P>
Another longtime park-watcher, Dean Malley, joined the fight against MCA after 
the Morehead report was released. Perpetually reddened by the sun, with blond 
hair brushed to the side, Malley is an intense, 40-year-old, self-employed 
computer salesman in Sonora. He grew up in La Jolla and spent his summers in 
Yosemite camping, rock scrambling and riding his inflatable mattress down the 
Merced. Long active in his local Sierra Club, he responded to the examination 
report by establishing Coalition 94, a loosely knit group with preservation as 
its goal. 
</P>
<P>
MCA's most formidable opposition, however, came from Patricia Schifferle, a 
savvy, well-organized and well-placed activist. Schifferle, 39, was the top 
California representative of the Wilderness Society, a Harvard 
University-educated public administrator and former consultant to the state 
Assembly Transportation Committee. She is athletic-looking and enthusiastic, 
moving quickly and purposefully, the cane she acquired with a recent back 
injury failing to slow her momentum. 
</P>
<P>
When she saw the examination report, she immediately demanded a full-blown 
environmental review and the opportunity for extensive public participation. 
The Curry Co. responded just as quickly. It sent 93,000 mailers to former park 
guests, asking them to oppose any reduction in accommodations and to support 
the replacement of some tent cabins with motel units. Schifferle was incensed. 
"If nothing were done," she said, "the examination report could have sealed the 
fate for Yosemite." 
</P>
<P>
Although Schifferle, Boland and Malley are hard-pressed to admit it, there is 
no proof that MCA had triggered Morehead's report despite its advantages for 
the company. Still, the corporation became the target of the preservationists' 
wrath. They began to call for a new concession, one that would be willing to 
scale back accommodations and raze more buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It was principally Schifferle who matched action with the idea of a revolt to 
unseat MCA. Working with a San Francisco attorney who sat on the board of a 
Yosemite educational group, Schifferle and the Wilderness Society began to 
assemble a nonprofit board of directors to compete with MCA for the Yosemite 
contract. This board would include environmentalists, former Park Service 
employees and businessmen with experience in concession management. Boland and 
Malley saw the advantages of a united front and joined forces with Schifferle. 
</P>
<P>
If the Wilderness Society group was successful, it would enact the 1980 master 
plan. At the very least, the group, called the Yosemite Restoration Trust, 
would ensure conservationists a seat at the negotiating table where they could 
influence the terms of the new contract. "It is a serious effort," Schifferle 
said. "You can't do it without seriously wanting to take over the contract. But 
much of the purpose here has been to put some public light on what has been a 
rather cozy process between the Park Service and MCA." 
</P>
<P>
She and other preservationists were encouraged when Michael Finley took over 
Yosemite in September, 1989. Tall and robust, with short, brown hair, Finley, 
44, had just finished three years as a superintendent in the controversial and 
ecologically threatened Everglades park, where environmentalists held him, as 
they had Morehead, in high regard. 
</P>
<P>
Finley played it cool at Yosemite. On the one hand, he made it clear to the 
activists that the examination report was neither his nor binding. He more or 
less ignored it. On the other hand, when the nonprofit Yosemite Assn. publicly 
condemned the report, Finley complained to its board of directors. As an 
educational organization subsidized by the Park Service, it had no business 
taking a political stand, Finley told the directors. The charter to operate in 
the park, he reminded them, could be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent also believed that the environmentalists were 
exaggerating what the master plan would do. "I keep hearing from Patty 
Schifferle of the Wilderness Society about making Yosemite natural," he 
complained last spring. "I just watched her on the "Today Show" this morning, 
and she was with the cameramen up here saying, 'This is a resort, this 
shouldn't be here.' " Even under the master plan, there would still be many 
buildings in Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Having failed to find a strong ally in Finley, Schifferle, Boland and Malley 
took their case to the public. The trio's campaign to oust MCA became a battle 
for the hearts and minds of Yosemite lovers. The conservationists pored over 
what little public documentation existed about MCA's park revenues and accused 
the corporation of profiteering. Park Service files were scoured. Every MCA 
deviation from the master plan -- even though approved by the Park Service -- 
was noted. Officials at the Interior Department and some members of Congress 
started talking about concession reform. A steady stream of news media traveled 
to Yosemite, and conservationists were ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the conservationists' campaign was a tour given by Malley this 
summer for a visiting reporter. He drove into the woods next to the Ahwahnee 
Hotel to point out Curry Co. valets. They were parking luxury automobiles 
between pines and firs. He headed to a Curry Co. store to criticize the 
merchandise -- everything from shoes to centennial coffee mugs. At the Curry 
Co.'s ice rink, which the master plan said should be replaced with a portable 
rink in winter only, he stopped. He complained that the lights are so bright in 
winter that they dim the stars and that he can hear the rink's music until 10 
p.m. when he camps. 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle and Boland distrust MCA, but Malley seems downright anxiety-ridden. 
He has taken to keeping with him electronic equipment that he says can detect 
eavesdropping devices. "Since I am interfering with a billion-dollar contract," 
he said, "I assume at some point that they are going to throw some technology 
at me to find out what I am saying to people." 
</P>
<P>
Driving his truck through the valley under a light rain, he spotted a white 
jeep following him and shoved a transmission frequency counter out the door. 
"I've seen that jeep parked outside the Curry Co. headquarters," he confided. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite employees sympathetic to the anti-MCA campaign share Malley's worries 
and add to them the fear that speaking out may jeopardize their jobs. They meet 
reporters in the protective darkness of the park's woods and spill tales of the 
concession's domination of the Park Service. One staff member is known as "Deep 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
A book called "Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and the Mob," by Dan E. Moldea, 
has sold a lot of copies around Yosemite, and Malley is one of its devotees. 
"It has pictures -- I'll show you," he said, seated behind the wheel of his 
truck. "It has people with blown-up vehicles and stuff and bullets to their 
heads sitting in front of cars." 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that Malley or anyone else is being followed or physically 
threatened or that frequency counters are necessary. The Curry Co. spokesman 
dismisses such notions as "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Some conservationists, removed from the action in the park, have watched the 
struggle with dismay. Environmentalist David Brower, for instance, is largely 
satisfied with MCA's performance at Yosemite. The Curry Co. recently hosted a 
reception for Brower at the Ahwahnee, and Brower has been a guest at one of 
Hardy's parties. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 78, the eminent environmentalist appreciates comfortable 
accommodations and sees no need to reduce them. Nor do the crowds bother him. 
"I can be alone in Yosemite Valley in 10 minutes," he said. "I know where to be 
alone -- but my lips are sealed." 
</P>
<P>
Brower believes that environmental groups cannot be watchdogs of parks if they 
are running a concession, and he objects to the Wilderness Society's MCA 
contract challenge. Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and 
Conservation Assn., agrees. Instead, he said, environmental groups should be 
questioning the need for concessions at all in the parks. History may support 
Brower and Pritchard's view of the inherent conflict. Alfred Runte, author of 
"Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness," wrote that Ansel Adams lost his 
preservationist attitude toward Yosemite after he and his wife inherited a 
photographic studio in the valley. The photographer, who had once opposed 
camping in the valley, was by the 1970s declaring that as many people as 
possible should visit " 'one of the greatest shrines of the world.' " The Ansel 
Adams Gallery, Runte wrote, had become the 
"preservationist-turned-businessman's bridge to his growing and adoring 
public." 
</P>
<P>
THE FIGHT OVER Yosemite Valley has already produced some changes. Interior 
Secretary Lujan has begun to overhaul both the concession contracting process 
and the terms of the deal. The government's cut of the profits is virtually 
certain to be higher than .75%, and Lujan promises to use outside consultants 
to help the Park Service forge better deals in future negotiations. He also 
wants the federal government gradually to buy the buildings now held by park 
concessioners, including the Curry Co. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Park Service, any rival bidder for the Yosemite contract would 
have to be able to purchase MCA's interest in its physical plant in Yosemite, 
which by some estimates is worth as much as $200 million to $300 million. 
"Unless the Department of Interior is able to own those buildings, the 
concessioner still has control of the park," a Lujan spokesman said. In the 
park itself, Superintendent Finley is still working at playing a mediator's 
role. "The thing I am trying to do is defuse the rhetoric, all the torpedoes 
flying back and forth," he said, seated in his office in Yosemite Village. 
</P>
<P>
He betrays irritation at the ruckus raised by the preservationists. Their 
constant nattering about the park's failure to enact the master plan or 
vigilantly oversee the Curry Co. has frustrated him. "The point is," he says, 
"that even the 1980 master plan did not envision Yosemite returning to 
wilderness or a natural setting. It called for reduction." Why can't the 
environmentalists focus on threats from air pollution instead of what kind of 
coffee mugs the Curry Co. sells? he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his irritation, Finley has heeded the criticism about his predecessor. 
There will be no more dinners with the concessioner at the Ahwahnee -- Finley 
refuses to socialize with Hardy. The new superintendent also appears intent 
about fulfilling more of the goals of the master plan: The Park Service 
announced in August that it will soon raze 20 park buildings. Finley, moreover, 
seems reluctant to allow the concession in the next contract to set aside more 
rooms for tour-bus travelers. "Due to the bus roar in Yosemite, my home in 
Yosemite Valley is noisier than it was in the Miami suburbs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Curry Co., Ed Hardy seems satisfied with Finley's decisions so far. 
Hardy, who refers to Finley as "my sixth superintendent" -- says Finley is 
better at the job than his predecessors, even better than Morehead, who 
considered Hardy a friend. "He is articulate and understands the balance of 
preservation and use, and I don't believe he is tainted by any side of the 
issue," Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the controversy, however, Hardy is not happy with the way 
outsiders may be viewing his company. Every time the 100th anniversary of 
Yosemite comes up, it seems the contract challenge comes up, too, and with it, 
preservationists' gripes about MCA. "I'm sick of being bashed," Hardy grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
As he did at the beginning of his tenure at the park, Hardy is spending time 
putting out image brush fires. Reporters who have covered the conflict at the 
park have learned to expect scathing letters from the Curry Co. to their 
editors and publishers. In a form of subtle intimidation, the company provides 
copies of these letters to other reporters in the park to cover the dispute. In 
one such letter the Curry Co. complained about a story in the Wall Street 
Journal. Meanwhile, a Park Service spokesman called the reporter to compliment 
the story's fairness. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the preservationists are simply trying to keep the planning 
process for the contract challenge on track. This month, their side was dealt a 
setback. Schifferle resigned after the Wilderness Society reassigned her from 
director to senior counsel. She said the Park Service -- unhappy with any 
attacks on its image as park caretakers -- complained to the Wilderness Society 
about her role in the contract challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society strongly denied this and pledged a strong campaign at 
Yosemite. But to conservationists close to the action, Schifferle's loss was 
significant. "She was the only person from the mainstream environmental 
movement willing to call a spade a spade," Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Wilderness Society has forged ahead without Schifferle. With its 
board of directors in place, the Yosemite Restoration Trust began to search for 
an executive director. In the coming months, it will initiate studies to help 
it make an effective bid for the contract. Financing will be sought, including 
foundation money for the trust itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Yosemite's centennial is under way. It will begin tomorrow 
with a low-key ceremony in a meadow in Yosemite Valley. Dignitaries will gather 
for speeches, an actor will portray John Muir in a short monologue and the 6th 
U.S. Army Band will perform. There also will be a moment of silence -- even 
nearby traffic will be stopped -- during which guests will be asked to envision 
Yosemite before people came. 
</P>
<P>
And when the party ends, the tug-of-war at Yosemite will undoubtedly resume. 
The spotlight on MCA has caused an examination of the concessioner-Park Service 
partnership, with all its inherent strains. In the wake of the Yosemite battle, 
there are those who are no longer sure "partnership" is even the right term: 
"There should be no more than a landlord and tenant relationship," says former 
Park Service Director George Hartzog, "and we don't call that a partnership." 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who faces the challenge of working out this relationship every day, 
expresses confidence that he will call the shots in the park. Yet there are 
echoes in Yosemite Valley, and they bounce back and forth between the offices 
of Hardy and Finley. Who is adopting whose words is not always clear, but the 
two men tend to say the same things when they describe park matters. Buses are 
not "the panacea," according to Hardy. "Buses are not the panacea," Finley 
says. The superintendent even lets Hardy frame the park-concession relationship 
for him. "As Ed says," says Finley, "we are the senior partner." 
</P>
<P>
ON BUSY DAYS in Yosemite Valley, it is possible to forget that you are in a 
national park. Conversations are drowned out by passing buses. Open-air tour 
trams glide by, and the Curry Co. guide speaking into the bullhorn is heard by 
more than just the visitors neatly sandwiched on the tram's benches. 
</P>
<P>
Lines snake everywhere, in the stores and in the cafeterias. Waiting for a 
sit-down meal can take as long as an hour and 45 minutes. A loudspeaker alerts 
diners waiting outside: "Gordon party of two, in the Mountain Room Broiler," 
"Anderson party of four, in the Four Seasons." If you weary of waiting and call 
over to Yosemite Village for a pizza, you would not be the first to ask if the 
Curry Co. pizza stand delivers. It doesn't, but the point is that the valley 
can feel so urban that delivery would not be out of place. 
</P>
<P>
But there also are times, even in summer, when Yosemite Valley loses its urban 
feeling, when the magic of the valley can still exist and the struggle to 
preserve it doesn't seem futile. A spate of bad weather on the heels of a 
holiday weekend can thin the crowds and slow the pace. On such a rare summer 
weekend, the lines are short, the waits tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
Man is in every scene, but he does not ruin it. A ragged coyote wanders among 
picnic tables, and a young boy watches it fearlessly. "Here, boy; here, boy," 
the child beckons. The animal, scavenging for food, ignores him. A man drinking 
a cup of coffee stands with his young daughter on his shoulders at the edge of 
the Merced and watches the river flow by. On a trail leaving the valley and 
winding up to Glacier Point, the hikers are few and far between. At dusk, only 
occasional couples pass on the pathways that wind through the meadows. Deer 
graze in the grass; a gray squirrel scampers across the path. The lower part of 
the granite walls are brown and gray in the approaching darkness, the upper 
halves still bathed in a pink glow from the declining sun. 
</P>
<P>
At times like these, you are reminded of what Yosemite Valley once was and, 
while the enduring struggle continues, what it still has the power to be.

AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bill creating Yosemite National Park was signed into law Oct. 1, 1890. By 
1906, President Theodore Roosevelt had visited the park, hiked to Bridalveil 
Falls with John Muir and added Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Sequoia Grove 
to the park's acreage. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical mid-summer weekend, there are 3,320 tourists per square mile in 
Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ansel Adams worked as Yosemite's publicist / photographer when he moved there 
in 1927; in the next thirty years he shot more than 40,000 park images. 
</P>
<P>
The Ahwahnichi (meaning "people who live in the valley shaped like a big 
mouth") Indians inhabited Yosemite Valley as early as the1500s. In 1625, there 
were 2,000 Ahwahnichi Indians; the last Ahwahnichi family left Yosemite in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock made a famous on-camera "ascent" of El Capitan in 
"Star Trek V." Stunt climbers were used for the rock-face scenes, and the two 
actors, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, were helicoptered to the summit for 
the finale. 
</P>
<P>
The first ascent of the back of Half Dome, using ropes and eyebolts, was in 
1875. In 1919, Sierra Club members replaced those with the rock's first cable 
ladder-cum-walkway. 
</P>
<P>
Naturalist Johnn Muir was 30 when he first came to Yosemite Valley via 
Inspiration Point in 1868; he had sailed from the Gulf of Mexico to San 
Francisco and from there hiked 200 miles into the valley. He once rode half a 
mile on a Sierra snow avalanche, living to write: "Elija's flight in a chariot 
of fire could hardly have been more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Exhaust, traffic jams and high tempers led to the 1972 start of the valley 
shuttle-bus service to stores, restaurants and museums. Today, the average wait 
for a shuttle is eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven species of mammals live in Yosemite National Park. The most 
common is the deer mouse; the rarest is the wolverine. In 1892, Yosemite banned 
grizzly bear hunting, and that same year the Department of Fish and Game 
introduced rainbow trout to the park's streams and lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening at sundown, park rangers used to fill a large chicken-wire ball 
with redwood bark and set it afire, and hurl it off Glacier Point to create the 
famous Yosemite fire fall. The spectacular sight was canceled in 1968 when 
spectator traffic jams filled the valley floor. It had been a park tradition 
since 1872. 
</P>
<P>
During Yosemite's third decade, rangers coaxed bears into the valley to eat 
garbage and frolic for spectators. The popular tourist attraction was 
discontinued in 1941, after the bears began to stay past showtime. The bears, 
however, had learned that where there were humans, there was food. By 1975, the 
number of reported human-bear incidents rose to 860; that year, rangers shot 
and killed six Yosemite bears. Not long after, the Human-Bear Management Plan, 
which educated people and marked troublesome bears for relocation in the high 
country, was developed. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite rangers started carrying guns in 1967 -- "It was during the hippie era 
and you never knew what you would encounter," remembers one -- and still carry 
them today. The 1970 Steadman Meadow affair also marked the hippie era. Rangers 
were accused of brutality when they used riot sticks to disperse hundreds of 
young people gathered for the July 4th weekend; 174 were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite Valley was the first runner-up as the site of the 1932 Winter 
Olympics. The Games were held in Lake Placid. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 1,200 climbing parties attempt to scale El Capitan, 3,593 feet 
above the valley floor. Fewer than half make it to the top. There are 200 
routes up the famous rock's face; the fastest party to reach the summit did it 
in six hours this year. 
</P>
<P>
The first car drove into the park in 1900, but most early visitors rode the 
Central Pacific Railroad from Stockton to within miles of the park entrance. 
The rest of the journey into the valley was completed in horse-drawn 
stagecoaches. In 1913, when car access began in ernest, the speed limit on 
curves was 6 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
Parachuting off El Capitan was briefly permitted in 1970, but was eventually 
considered too dangerous and outlawed in 1980. In 1973, stunt skier Rick 
Sylvester became the first -- and only -- person to ski-parachute off El 
Capitan. When he landed he was arrested and charged with illegal flight. 
</P>
<P>
On a peak visitor day, the general store in Yosemite Village will sell 450 
rolls of camera film. 
</P>
<P>
John Muir considered the Hetch-Hetchy Valley, on the park's northern boundary, 
even more beautiful than Yosemite Valley, and when the Hetch-Hetchy Dam was 
approved in 1914, he left the park heartbroken. He died of pneumonia the 
following year and never saw the flooded valley. The dam was completed in 1934, 
sending water to San Francisco taps. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, Yosemite hosts the Bracebridge Dinner, a traditional English 
Christmas supper served by costumed actors in the Great Lounge of the Ahwahnee. 
The first dinner was held the year the Ahwahnee opened, and the lead role of 
Squire Bracebridge was played by photographer Ansel Adams. 
</P>
<P>
When the Ahwahnee Hotel opened in 1927, a room cost $6 a night and included 
maid service and a chauffeur. Today, rooms go for nearly $200 a night, and it's 
almost impossible to get reservations less than a year ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a tourist package, the Curry Co. in 1924 created Indian Field Days, 
a "festival and rodeo to celebrate the colorful culture of the park's original 
inhabitants." The Ahwahnichi, fewer than 15 families who lived at 
government-owned Camp Sunnyside in the park, demonstrated basketry and weaving, 
competed in a "cutest Indian baby" contest and performed native dances for a 
mostly Anglo audience. Indian Field Days ended in 1929 amid criticism calling 
the event exploitative. 
</P>
<P>
A raging fire ignited by lightning charred close to 13,000 park acres this past 
August. Aggressive firefighting, which snuffed the blaze in two weeks, caused 
some grumblings in the Park Service, which contends that natural fires should 
be allowed to burn unchecked in parts of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Galen Clark, appointed Yosemite's first superintendent in 1866, was paid $500 a 
year and lived rent-free on parkland; Michael Finley, the current 
superintendent, is paid $69,086 and rents National Park Service housing for 
$487.54 a month.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: RED IVY, GREEN EARTH MOTHER BY AI BEI TRANSLATED FROM THE

The four stories in "Red Ivy, Green Earth Mother," Ai Bei's first work to be 
translated into English, paint a harsh, unflinching picture of women's lives 
and roles in China that is very different from the tales of vague, unhappy 
marriages and urban anomie in contemporary American fiction. In "Green Earth 
Mother," a young bride finds herself engaged in a power struggle for her 
husband's affections with her smothering mother-in-law. Setting "Red Ivy" in a 
women's prison enables Bei to describe the social injustice, corruption and 
vice that flourish beneath the veneer of party rhetoric and ostensibly 
democratic institutions, in a rare vision of people caught in the clash between 
feudalistic traditions and governmental efforts to move a society into the 
modern era.

ZEN AND THE ART OF CALLIGRAPHY; THE ESSENCE OF SHO BY OMORI SOGEN AND TERAYAMA

The Japanese concept of calligraphy is very different from the Western one: Its 
aim is not to produce pretty letters (some of the finest calligraphy borders on 
illegibility) but to imbue each brush stroke with the self-conscious 
artlessness that characterizes Japanese aesthetics. "The Essence of Sho" 
surveys the themes of the Zen school of calligraphic art, one tenant of which 
states: "For a work to be truly alive, each of the thousand hairs of the brush 
must be energized"; Omori Sogen and Terayama Katsujo use electron 
photomicrographs to reveal how in the best work, the individual particles of 
ink form recognizable patterns, even when magnified 50,000 times! 
</P>
<P>
"Brush Mind" comprises 60 one-stroke paintings done by the noted modern 
calligrapher, Kazuaki Tanahashi. These minimal, intriguing pictures reveal the 
extraordinary flexibility of the brush in the hands of a master, and range from 
fragile-looking wisps that suggest waves on a distant sea to broad, black 
swipes relieved only by a few tiny streaks of white. Accompanying the pictures 
is a collection of Tanaha-shi's often paradoxical reflections on various 
subjects: "To be thoroughly lazy is a tough job, but somebody has to do it. 
Industrious people build industry. Lazy people build civilization."

The characters in these stories by the National Book Award winner seem to skate 
over the surface of reality without ever touching it. In "A More Complete 
Cross-Section," the narrator is so completely out of touch with his life that 
the external world becomes something he can't quite believe in, like a bad 
film. 
</P>
<P>
The novella "Connaissance des Arts" is a sort of double Pygmalion story: As a 
stuffy college professor helps a vibrant young woman learn how to enjoy life, 
he discovers ways of sharing his emotions. Ironically, the title story is the 
least interesting of the collection: John Casey sets out to create a boring 
little man and his constipated milieu, and succeeds only too well -- Mr. Pelham 
bores the reader as well as the narrator.

FATHER AND THE KING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I couldn't help but be more than interested in your "Endpapers" citation of 
Daniel Moynihan's forthcoming book, "On the Law of Nations" ("How Mesopotamia 
Became Iraq (and Why It Matters)" by Jack Miles, Sept. 2). The photo of King 
Hussein of the Hejaz immediately rang a bell and sent me to my old photo album 
where I found the enclosed photo. 
</P>
<P>
I went to Cyprus when I was 6 (1926); my father was working as managing 
director of Cyprus Mines Corp. (started by Harvey Mudd). One day we had a 
visitor at the mines who, my father told me, was "the King of the Hejaz." It 
didn't mean much to me at the time, but I did remember his gentle face and 
demeanor and the fact that he was in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Your article has put things back into perspective and I have been reading 
Fromkin's "A Peace to End All Peace" as well as Bullock's "Allenby's War," 
which refers to Hussein's exile in Cyprus after he incurred the displeasure of 
the British.

Re Georgia Jones-Davis' edifying "Storytellers" of Aug. 19:

<P>
The chapter headings, as well as the title, of Thomas Tryon's "The Wings of

in their homes, hiding the "artistic" nudes in secret desk drawers, false-front 
books and bookcases or behind those same prints. 
</P>
<P>
As for the "10th-Century art of Ishinpo" in Sidney Sheldon's "Memories of

innovation in painting.

MERCHANT MARINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Vietnam War historian, I was pleased to read the Aug. 26 review by Charles 
Bowden on "Looking for a Ship" by John McPhee. Bowden's review summarizes the 
changes within the merchant-marine industry during the past 20 years and it 
clearly outlines the potential impacts the current events in the Middle East 
and the Persian Gulf may have on the merchant fleet. 
</P>
<P>
However, readers should not forget that when American merchant ships become the 
illegal targets of foreign governments' military action, it is the American 
military that is called to the rescue. All we have to do is recall the Vietnam 
War and the SS Mayaguez. 
</P>
<P>
On May 12, 1975, while the U.S. was still at war in Southeast Asia, the 
Mayaguez, under Capt. Charles Miller, was fired upon by Cambodian gunboats and 
forcefully boarded while in international waters off the coast of Cambodia. The 
40 civilian crew members were taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined in Roy Rowan's book, "The Four Days of Mayaguez," President Ford 
ordered a rescue mission involving Air Force, Marine and Navy personnel. The 
crew members and ship were rescued, but at a loss of 15 American military 
personnel killed and three missing. Fifty more were wounded in the rescue 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
As the United States answers a new call for democracy, let us not forget that 
when serving in a battle zone, the merchant marine is at times exposed to 
danger. Yet it is ultimately the American military personnel, earning far less 
per year than the $30,000 to $60,000 of a merchant seaman, who will be called 
upon to rescue that merchant fleet, even at the risk of being wounded or 
killed.

During Jack Miles' call to John McPhee to amplify the review of "Looking for a 
Ship," both men ran aground. Miles reports McPhee said that the Scandinavians 
have quit shipbuilding altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Both men need refloating. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee's accuracy, so beautifully applied to birchbark canoes and to the Swiss 
Army, is reliable when he paddles the canoe, marches in the Alps and sails the 
freighter. But, obviously, McPhee has not visited the Baltic lately. 
</P>
<P>
On a Baltic tour last month I was shown a gigantic liner under construction at 
the Masa Yards in Helsinki harbor, Finland. It is the Ecstasy, said to be the 
largest cruise hull ever, to be delivered to the Carnival line in 1991. 
Carnival recently received their Fantasy cruise ship from the Finns.

GROWING UP WITH GROUCHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andy Marx, Andy Marx is senior editor of Hollywood Magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
ON JULY 27, 1977, I was appointed my grandfather's conservator. I was 26 and 
suddenly in the ironic position of caretaker to a man I had always believed to 
be invincible -- a man who now lay dying. My grandfather was Groucho Marx, and 
if he were still alive, next Tuesday would be his 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The chef at Trader Vic's in Beverly Hills is probably relieved he's not around 
to celebrate it. My grandfather's annual birthday dinner at that restaurant 
always ended the same way, with one of his trademark tirades. "This food is 
lousy. Take it back and dump it on the chef's head!" he would order the waiter. 
I pitied anyone who didn't know he was a regular customer. Because this was 
just my grandfather's way -- Groucho was often at his grouchiest (the attitude 
came before the nickname) when he was showing his appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Even as a young child, I understood that my grandfather's gruff behavior was a 
facade. He was always eager to have his grandson around. He would spend hours 
asking me about school, earnestly discussing whatever I was studying. But as 
soon as his guests arrived, he slipped back into his irritable Groucho persona. 
And they had better arrive on time -- if dinner was at 7, that was when Groucho 
began eating, whether his guests, no matter how important, were there or not. 
</P>
<P>
Although I felt I understood him, I was still awed that this larger-than-life 
image I saw at the movies could step off the screen and become real. On and off 
screen, he always had an answer; no one could best him. To me, he was a hero. 
And unlike today's action-macho characters who rely on heavy artillery, Grandpa 
Groucho could get out of any tight spot with just a look and a well-placed 
one-liner. 
</P>
<P>
Being Groucho's grandson didn't mean I had a Hollywood childhood. The only time 
I tried to take advantage of having a famous grandfather was when I was 11 
years old. It was the summer of 1962, and I was away at camp. One afternoon, 
Robbie Edwards boasted that his ancestors had come to America on the Mayflower. 
</P>
<P>
"Big deal," I replied. "My grandfather is Groucho Marx." Robbie didn't believe 
me, so I bet him 50 cents. There was just one problem. How was I going to prove 
it? My prayers were answered several days later when I received an unexpected 
surprise, a letter from Grandpa Groucho: 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Andy, 
</P>
<P>
 Your mother tells me you're having a hot time at camp, and I thought that by 
this time you might have written me a letter describing your activities. What's 
the good of me being your grandfather if you don't send me any news about 
yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 How long are you going to be up there? 
</P>
<P>
 When you get back, be sure to give me a ring. I will invite you over to swim 
and throw water on the French poodles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping this reaches you by Pony Express, I still remain your grandfather, 
</P>
<P>
 Groucho 
</P>
<P>
 Elated, I ran to Robbie's cabin to collect my winnings. Unfortunately, Robbie 
had left because someone in his family was ill. So much for milking the family 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Although I never got my 50 cents, I did spend many days that summer swimming in 
Groucho's pool and harassing the dogs (one of which was named De Soto, after 
the sponsor of "You Bet Your Life"). I had a standing invitation to hang out 
with my grandfather, and that summer was much like every summer. In the 
mornings, I'd bum a ride with my mother, Irene (she separated from my father, 
Groucho's son Arthur, when I was 10), to Groucho's house in Beverly Hills. Upon 
my arrival, Groucho would kiss me on the cheek, his mustache, with its 
unmistakable scent of cigar, tickling my face. 
</P>
<P>
Groucho had recently completed a 14-year run as the wise-cracking host of NBC's 
popular quiz show, "You Bet Your Life." Now he was 71 and semi-retired, but 
even when he was working, he found plenty of time to be a grandfather. We swam 
together and watched cartoons -- "Crusader Rabbit" was our favorite. Both avid 
Dodger fans, we listened to the games on the radio, arguing about whether the 
team would pull it off that year. And in 1965, we both were on the edge of our 
seats, cheering for Sandy Koufax the night he pitched his perfect game. Groucho 
never used a one-liner when he was talking about baseball; baseball was sacred. 
</P>
<P>
When I was an adolescent, Groucho had yet to be turned into a living legend. It 
had been more than a decade since the Marx Brothers, as a team, had made a film 
and even longer since they had made one that was considered worth watching. 
Their early efforts, including 1929's "The Cocoanuts" and "Animal Crackers" in 
1930, had propelled the brothers to stardom. But by the 1950s, their movies, 
including "Duck Soup" and "A Night at the Opera," had been all but forgotten, 
dismissed as mildly funny. (It was a source of much amusement to Groucho when, 
in the late '60s, their films were labeled masterpieces of sophisticated wit.) 
</P>
<P>
He still had time to lunch with his old cronies, especially two of his closest 
pals -- the great wit and pianist Oscar Levant and the songwriter Harry Ruby -- 
at Nate 'n Al's delicatessen in Beverly Hills. Often I would tag along. 
Predictably, my grandfather's personality shifted when we were around his 
showbiz friends. He became the combative Groucho -- ordering waitresses around, 
arguing heatedly with Levant -- as soon as we walked in the door. But even when 
I was on the receiving end of one of Groucho's withering one-liners, I sensed 
that he was proud to have me there. 
</P>
<P>
To survive these lunches, I developed my skills at verbal combat; occasionally, 
I scored a few points. One day, I arrived late and Groucho gave me the 
once-over. 
</P>
<P>
"You're late," he growled. "And I'm ashamed to see you." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you think I feel seeing you?" I shot back. 
</P>
<P>
As Levant and Ruby chuckled, Groucho relented. "Do you want to join us?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" I replied. "Are you coming apart?" This time I had gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me give you a piece of advice," he barked, scowling. "There's nothing 
worse than bagging another man's jokes, especially when that man happens to be 
your grandfather." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, in 1969, when I entered college, the renewed fascination 
with the Marx Brothers was just beginning to simmer. Their movies were showing 
up in revival houses, their posters were all over dorms and Groucho-isms were 
de rigueur. 
</P>
<P>
I, like a great many others of my generation, found myself hooked by their zany 
irreverence. But I had a head start on the lines and soon developed a much 
sought-after Groucho imitation. I still saw my grandfather every couple of 
weeks, and at a family party, I seized the opportunity to impress him by 
dropping a few of his more famous wisecracks. 
</P>
<P>
"May I buy back my introduction to you?" I asked. He glared at me. I tried 
another: "You haven't stopped talking since you got here. You must've been 
vaccinated with a phonograph needle." Again, I was met with a glower. I decided 
to ask him about "Duck Soup." Before I could get a question out, he stopped me. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen," he snapped, "what makes you think I want to talk about those old 
movies? I'm not interested in something that I did 30 years ago. When you start 
talking about things you did in the past, you get old." 
</P>
<P>
Little did he know that in just a few years, when Marx mania was at its height, 
he would gladly spend hours reminiscing with Dick Cavett and others. When this 
transformation occurred, Groucho granted me an interview for my college 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
As he greeted me at his house the day of the interview, I took out my tape 
recorder. "What's that for?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm recording you," I said. "I want to get everything right." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't let Life magazine record me," he fired back, angrily. "Why should I 
let you?" 
</P>
<P>
The passion for the Marx Brothers reached a fever pitch. In 1972, a performance 
by Groucho at Carnegie Hall sold out the day it was announced. Two years later, 
he was given a special Academy Award. I watched proudly as my grandfather 
slowly made his way onstage to the roar of applause. Weakened by several 
strokes, he paid tribute to his brothers. "I only wish Harpo and Chico could 
have been here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner at Grandpa's was no longer a simple family affair. It was a celebrity 
circus: Jack Nicholson, Elliott Gould, Liza Minnelli, Steve Allen, Jack Lemmon, 
Carroll O'Connor, Bill Cosby and Alice Cooper were just a few who would drop 
in. Groucho had become an idol the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, I was thrilled to meet some of these stars, but I also wished I had 
more time alone with my grandfather. And when he was 84, I'm not sure he really 
knew who a lot of these new-found admirers were; he probably couldn't tell Liza 
Minnelli from Alice Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
No evening was complete until he got the chance to regale his guests with 
several spirited choruses of "Hello, I Must Be Going" and "Hooray for Captain 
Spaulding" from "Animal Crackers." Although he seemed to enjoy himself, these 
predictable performances began to remind me of a talented kid being trotted out 
to play the violin for his parents' guests. 
</P>
<P>
As Groucho's health declined, these parties became more and more infrequent. In 
1977, he was in and out of Cedars-Sinai. In late June, he entered the hospital 
for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
I visited him often and was heartened one day by his insistence that we watch 
baseball's All-Star game on TV together that July. Sitting on the edge of his 
bed, I longed for the afternoons we had spent together listening to Dodger 
games. It was one of the last peaceful afternoons I spent with him. 
</P>
<P>
While Groucho battled for his life, a battle of a different sort raged in a 
Santa Monica courtroom. For the previous five years, to my father's 
consternation, Groucho had been keeping company with Erin Fleming, who had 
great influence over him. Fleming and my father were now fighting over who 
would be Groucho's conservator. Because of the vested interests of both sides, 
the judge chose a neutral party -- me. I was to run Groucho's household, confer 
with the doctors and make whatever decisions there were to make. The man whom I 
had admired all my life was suddenly in my care. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Groucho took a turn for the worse. His doctor informed me on 
the morning of Aug. 19 that my grandfather would probably not live through the 
day. I spent the next several hours with my father and stepmother, watching 
Groucho slip in and out of consciousness. As with any appearance by Groucho 
Marx, the scene was not without humor. As my grandfather teetered on the edge 
of death, Elliott Gould, in tennis whites and carrying a racket, breezed in as 
though he was expecting to get in a fast game with Groucho. Shocked at 
Groucho's appearance, he sheepishly excused himself. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as the sun set, Groucho's condition worsened. At 7:25 p.m., my 
grandfather was gone. I watched my father kiss him on the forehead, and I did 
the same. I took one last look at Grandpa Groucho, the man who almost won me 50 
cents in the summer of 1962. 
</P>
<P>
In the following days, I was constantly asked how Groucho died. "Too many 
birthdays," I would reply, pilfering yet another joke from the master.

It's difficult to imagine any woman dressed in shorts, or a short unitard, on a 
winter day in New York or Paris. But the idea makes such good sense here, it's 
as if designers worldwide had Southern California in mind. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Emanuel Ungaro and Jean Paul Gaultier offer distinctly different 
versions of winter-weight shorts. Ungaro's sporty, cuffed styles are mid-thigh 
length, made of menswear fabric and worn with an ultra- feminine velvet jacket, 
floral-print vest, silky blouse and tall, protective suede boots. Gaultier 
mixes a thigh-high bodysuit in Fair Isle patterned sweater knit with a sporty 
anorak. And he shows it with clunky leather ski boots, a footwear idea born in 
the city streets. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, Giorgio Armani pairs short shorts of menswear wool plaid with 
slouchy, oversized jackets. He adds deep-brimmed fedoras to soften the look. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Holly Sharp's stretchy cycle shorts go with peplum jackets. 
Melivier's tailored silk Bermudas have a long, narrow silk jacket. And for 
evening, Pepito Albert's red satin hot pants travel to dinner and dance clubs, 
topped by floor-sweeping bathrobe-style coats. MARY ROURKE

"Our children (clients) start at age 40," says Bill Connolly, owner of the Toy 
Soldier Exchange, which specializes in collector-quality toy soldiers, 
primarily from the Edwardian and Victorian eras. The store stocks such lines as 
William Britains Ltd., Bill Hocker, Imperial Productions of New Zealand and 
Alymer. 
</P>
<P>
Pieces range from $6 to $100; sets begin at $45. Connolly also buys and swaps 
old toy soldiers. 
</P>

Every glass case in Connolly's shop displays myriad adventures to titillate the 
imaginations of both the casual observer and the seasoned collector. In one, a

ARTS FESTIVALS; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S SAN FRANCISCO'S TURN; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL 2000 CELEBRATES CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND IS SEEN AS A "BOOKEND" TO 
L.A.'S RECENTLY COMPLETED ARTS FEST

<P>
As Los Angeles winds down from its arts festival, San Francisco is gearing up 
to launch a 23-day extravaganza of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Grandly billed as "one of the most ambitious celebrations of the arts ever held 
in an American city," Festival 2000 kicks off Saturday with a gala "Sole Night" 
dance concert at the War Memorial Opera House, hosted by legendary 
choreographer Katherine Dunham and featuring the American Indian Dance Theatre, 
the Muntu Dance Theater of Chicago and Jelon Viera's DanceBrazil. 
</P>
<P>
Budgeted at $2.5 million, with $500,000 from the City of San Francisco, the 
Festival 2000 tab amounts to half what the 1990 Los Angeles Festival cost. But 
in its own fashion, the San Francisco event is as logistically complex and 
controversial as Peter Sellars' elaborate undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
Both festivals were planned around the guiding principle of "multiculturalism" 
-- that ubiquitous buzzword for the ethnic diversity that is already a 
demographic fact of life in California, if not yet a social reality. But, while 
the Los Angeles event presented traditional art forms from "root" cultures of 
the Pacific Rim, Festival 2000 is commissioning new works by American artists 
of many backgrounds. Half the offerings are original, cross-ethnic "fusion" 
pieces; the remainder are imported existing works in a similar vein. 
</P>
<P>
Lenwood Sloan, the ebullient director of the festival and its chief architect, 
views the L.A. and San Francisco events as "bookends." 
</P>
<P>
"There have always been festivals of looking back, and they're important," says 
Sloan. "But they also tend to freeze-dry cultures into dashikis and kimonos and 
mariachis and drums. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing an ethnic festival, but a presentation of futuristic pieces by 
artists of color," he emphasizes. "You won't find any exotic food booths at 
Festival 2000, or any exotic crafts on sale. And we're not talking about Africa 
or Asia or South America -- we're talking about Chicago and Oakland and San 
Antonio. We're dealing with living, kinetic expressions, and trying to create a 
body of exciting collaborative work that will be infused into the national 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
Other key players in the festival echo Sloan's commitment to work that is 
contemporary and culturally eclectic. They stress that such collaborations by 
white, black, Asian American, Native American and Latino artists may help 
ameliorate the ethnic divisiveness some social critics disparage as a "New 
Tribalism." 
</P>
<P>
"Festival 2000 is either ahead of its time for going beyond the 'New 
Tribalism,' or it's hopelessly out of step," comments Kary Shulman, the 
director of the city's Grants for the Arts funding agency and an instigator of 
the event. "I think we're onto something important here, because I do believe 
the arts speak to our common humanity. At its very best that's what this 
festival will demonstrate." 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking toward the future, to remaking the ways traditions can encounter 
each other and result in innovation," observes artist and educator Amalia 
Mesa-Bains, who sits on the festival's board of directors. "Ethnic specificity 
may be a point along the way to cultural identity. But most people in this 
country live in a bicultural world by now. We grow up next door to each other, 
eat each other's food and listen to each others' music, and there are bound to 
be more and more cross-overs and partnerships." 
</P>
<P>
Few in San Francisco's large, diverse arts community are quarreling with 
Festival 2000's multicultural theme. After all, the city has been a prime 
example of ethnic multiplicity since 1849, when waves of Chinese, European and 
Hispanic immigrants converged here to join in the Gold Rush. In more recent 
times, San Franciscans have honored their heritage in such popular annual 
events as the Ethnic Dance Festival, the city's Carnaval parade, and the Native 
American Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
But a lot more is riding on the aggressively pluralistic Festival 2000. For one 
thing, the city pumped a large sum of money into it before the recent economic 
dip; the event will probably not be repeated again unless it can generate 
substantial support elsewhere. The festival has also raised expectations among 
local artists that it will bring them more exposure and, perhaps, national 
bookings. 
</P>
<P>
The festival may also forge a fruitful new partnership between San Francisco's 
low-budget, multicultural arts sector and the city's well-heeled, classical and 
European-oriented ballet, symphony and opera. In recent years, arts activists 
have criticized the city for giving these prominent companies too large a share 
of local arts funding. The institutions have also been attacked 
</P>
<P>
for inadequate ethnic representation on their boards and staffs. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the hot agenda items on the table when I started organizing the 
festival was, 'What is the relationship between the major institutions and 
multicultural arts groups?' " Sloan says. "I found there was a desire to talk 
and a mandate to engage on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
That engagement has resulted mostly in practical, behind-the-scenes help from 
the larger institutions. San Francisco Opera chief Lofti Mansouri and San 
Francisco Ballet general manager Joyce Moffatt served on the festival's 
steering committee. The War Memorial Board, which governs the city's larger 
arts facilities, donated use of the Opera House and Davies Symphony Hall for 
two events. The San Francisco Symphony gave proceeds of a pops concert with Cab 
Calloway to the festival effort, and the ballet and opera have, according to 
Sloan, "been instrumental in the design and production of the opening night 
concert." 
</P>
<P>
Direct artistic involvement was not feasible, says Sloan, because season 
calendars had already been set two years ago. But he contends that groundwork 
has been laid for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the high hopes, though, serious questions have been raised about Sloan's 
grandiose festival design, the effectiveness of his 18-member administrative 
and production staff, and the organization's handling of a serious budget 
crisis last spring. 
</P>
<P>
One frequently heard concern is that the festival's marketing campaign is too 
little, too late. A key participant (who asked not to be identified) 
complained, "The vision is great, but I wonder if the staff is capable of 
bringing the whole thing off. The promotion has been really mismanaged." And 
recently the music critic of the San Francisco Examiner groused in print about 
the event's "tardy publicity campaign" and its "cluttered and complicated" 
calendar of events -- a charge also leveled at the L.A. Festival for its 
confusing program. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan bristles when these criticisms are raised. He insists the festival will 
sell the 60,000 tickets it must to break even. And he points to the television 
public service announcements, the several million Safeway shopping bags 
emblazoned with the Festival 2000 logo, and the posters on city buses as proof 
that word is getting out. 
</P>
<P>
But Sloan does not deny that over 18 months of planning he has endured some 
tough stretches and a few run-ins with the city's highly politicized arts 
community. That, he contends, was inevitable in a project of this scope. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned from Peter Sellars in L.A., and from Michelle Smith, who directs 
the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, about the tightrope you walk when 
you try to do something that's grounded in your community but also of national 
significance," Sloan remarks. "It's a tightrope made tighter by lack of funds." 
</P>
<P>
The financial outlook for Festival 2000 seemed rosy in 1988, when Grants for 
the Arts catalyzed the event with a $500,000 infusion. The money came out of 
the 12.5% portion of the city's Hotel Tax Fund that is distributed each year to 
local cultural institutions, parades and festivals. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of presenting a major multicultural showcase, says Shulman, "bubbled 
up simultaneously from several sources. It just seemed to all of us that it was 
the right concept at the right time for this city." 
</P>
<P>
Sloan came aboard in January of 1989 to head the newly formed, nonprofit 
festival organization. Though based at the time in New York, he was no stranger 
to Northern California. While Jerry Brown was governor, Sloan served as deputy 
director of the California Arts Council and helped organize CAC's State/Local 
Partnership program. He headed East to work as a consultant for the National 
Endowment for the Arts and to produce a festival of black dance at the Brooklyn 
Academy of Music. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt Leni had the kind of background and experience we needed to bring this 
thing off," Shulman recalls. "We left the shaping of the artistic concept up to 
him. When you hire an impresario, you need to trust that person and their 
vision." 
</P>
<P>
Sloan's vision of new, hybrid works, initiated by local and out-of-town artists 
of color and produced with future touring in mind, didn't please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Jewish and Irish arts groups in the city got mad at me, saying 'We're ethnic 
too,' " Sloan reports. "Some black and Chicano artists were angry because we 
didn't just automatically fund them. My answer was always that this is not an 
ethnic event, but a contemporary festival of fusion work. I don't see 
'multicultural' as a term of entitlement, but as a term of inclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Sloan's national call for commission ideas generated 300 proposals. A jury of 
artists then selected 23 to receive awards of up to $40,000. Some of the more 
expensive productions -- Urban Bush Woman's "Praise House," the 
Balinese-American piece "Body Tjak" -- were planned as joint ventures with 
presenters from outside the area, including the Walker Art Center in 
Minneapolis and the Festival of Indonesia. Many of the other events are 
co-productions with Bay Area venues. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Festival 2000 unveiled its plans to the public at a Union 
Square rally with Mayor Art Agnos on hand. A few weeks later came the severe 
earthquake that rocked the Bay Area. The festival had already received major 
gifts from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trust, San Francisco 
Foundation and other sources. But $600,000 in promised corporate contributions 
dried up in the aftermath of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"The last quivers hit us," Sloan says, "because economically the Bay Area 
didn't have a fourth quarter last year. Every arts organization in the city had 
to cut back, and so did we." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until May that the festival's board of directors decided to trim 
$500,000 from the budget by eliminating 14 commissioned projects. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not something we did lightly," says Fran Streets, the board 
president. "We spent a great deal of time soul-searching." 
</P>
<P>
That was no comfort to the nine local arts groups who suddenly received letters 
rescinding their commissions; many had begun working and incurring expenses. 
Angered by the lack of warning and other communication problems, they swiftly 
demanded a meeting with Sloan and festival staffers. That encounter, recalls an 
observer, "was very tense but ultimately productive." In the end all but three 
of the canceled commissions were restored, though at much-reduced levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Controversies over empowerment and turf are ongoing issues, and that's nothing 
new," comments Cowell Theatre director Bob Martin, the presenter of several 
festival events. "What excites me is the quality of artists involved. I think 
there's going to be some really outstanding work." 
</P>
<P>
As the festival appraoches, Sloan prefers to take a more philosophical 
overview. "A lot of people use your turnstile as the yardstick of success," he 
suggests. "But one of the reasons I respect Peter Sellers so much is because he 
knew that a festival is a dividend project -- and the dividends may come six 
months or even a year later. A festival is a catalytic agent. It creates new 
ways to talk, new schools of expression. You can't weigh it in pound for pound. 
For me, the real dividend will come after the festival, when the art work goes 
out there to the rest of America and has an impact on the body culture."

pieces by artists of color . . . a body of exciting collaborative work that 
will be infused into the national culture," says Lenwood Sloan, executive 
director of Festival 2000. CINDY CHARLES / For The Times

PBS STRUTS ITS STUFF TO NAB VIEWERS FOR THE FALL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No longer content to passively watch its viewers tune out and watch cable, PBS 
has decided to get tough and aggressively counterprogram. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as the networks were airing season premieres of new and returning 
series, PBS devoted its prime-time schedule to one show: Ken Burns' 11-hour 
documentary "The Civil War." And on Sunday, PBS officially begins its new fall 
season with a potpourri of series and specials entitled "Showcase Week." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a celebration," said Jennifer Lawson, executive vice president for 
programming and promotional services. "It's not so much a sampling of all you 
can see on PBS, but a sampling of some of the best we traditionally have." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said PBS doesn't have the viewership it would like: "Like the networks, 
we have been affected by the drop in viewership overall and the increased 
competitive nature of what viewers have available (to watch). Our numbers have 
dropped slightly. All of our activities are designed in part to help reverse 
that trend and more importantly, it is just a part of our new approach in 
trying to make people aware of public TV." 
</P>
<P>
To heighten the awareness of "Showcase Week," PBS is even airing commercials on 
its competition. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning the week is the season premiere of "Nature" and the season opener of 
"Masterpiece Theatre." See related story for a complete schedule of "Showcase 
Week." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Winfield, a familiar face on PBS ("American Playhouse" and "Wonderworks"), 
hosts "Showcase Week." "We wanted a host who was not just simply a celebrity 
who did not have a connection to public TV," Lawson said. "It was important to 
have somebody whose work reflected what PBS was about." 
</P>
<P>
While cable's A&amp;E Network and Discovery Channel still acquire a majority of 
their programs from Britain, Australia and Canada, PBS has decreased its number 
of imports. "We have made a conscious effort over the past 10 years to put far 
more of our resources into our own productions," Lawson said. "That was our 
intent behind the creation of "American Playhouse," "Wonderworks," "American 
Masters," and "The American Experience." At one point, someone said we may have 
too many series that are entitled "American something," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
PBS is in the midst of restructuring, "so we have a bit more centralization of 
our funding and can then support new programming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, PBS stations across the country would individually purchase the 
programs that made up the PBS schedule. "That put PBS in a passive position of 
just scheduling what the stations collectively decided to buy," said Lawson. 
That explains why each local station can air PBS programs on different days, at 
different times or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
PBS hopes to achieve uniform scheduling sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
The network is banking that in some cases viewers would rather watch a special 
multipart series such as "The Civil War" over an entire week instead of airing 
one episode a week over several months. When a series is extended over a period 
of time, viewership tends to drop. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to see the next episode, you have to make an appointment to see it 
the next Wednesday and the Wednesday after that," Lawson said. "Putting the 
series on during a week, there is a greater likelihood viewers who find it 
compelling material will come back to it."

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the rising prices of French (and California) wines in the last few years, 
Italian wines have come to represent the best values on wine lists. But they 
offer more than just reasonable prices; Italian wines offer exotic and 
interesting tastes that match well with food. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that few Americans are familiar with the lesser-known Italian 
wines. Would you know, without help, that Breganze di Breganze from Maculan is 
85% Tocai and 15% Pinot Bianco and fresh as a spring morning? Or that 
Antinori's Cervaro Della Sala is a wonderful Chardonnay, or that Arneis is a 
soft, fragrant white wine with a delicate creaminess? 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Sedo, I Cugini's sommelier, can tell you. He speaks four languages, he 
knows the 125 wines on I Cugini's list (half of which are Italian), and he's 
happy to serve you your own wine should you take advantage of I Cugini's 
moderate corkage fee, $5 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Pricing of the wine here is fair -- not cheap, not too expensive. And with a 
little guidance you can find the real values, such as (among white wines) the 
Breganze di Breganze at $20; Anselmi's Capitel Croce Soave at $25; Saintsbury's 
Vin Gris at $17, or Folie a Deux's wonderful 1989 dry Chenin Blanc at $13. 
</P>
<P>
Among the red wines, there are a lot of great values starting with a wine 
perfect for the garlicky dishes here, the exciting 1988 Quivira Zinfandel 
($18). The Italian section of the wine list, however, has such gems as 1985 
Ceretto Barbaresco Asij ($35), 1988 Refosco from Collavini at $16, a wine that 
is fresh and youthful, halfway between Beaujolais and Zinfandel. There is also 
1985 Monte Vertine Riserva at $45. The '85 is no longer commercially available, 
but the '86 retails for $31 a bottle, making the '85 a bargain at $45. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a drawback here it's the glassware -- clunky little things that 
don't befit some of the great wines. 
</P>
<P>
If what you want is just a glass of wine, there are five reds and five whites 
sold by the glass, ranging from $3.75 for a simple Verdicchio and Valpolicella 
to $5.50 for a Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay and Ravenswood Cabernet Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
Grappa lovers will have a field day here; there are nearly four dozen on the 
list, as well as various liqueurs, Sherries, Ports, cognacs and other assorted 
after-dinner specialties. (A glass of 1970 Graham Port is $10.)

THREE S.D. DISTRICTS PLACED ON STRICT WATER-USE RULES; 
</P>
<P>
EMERGENCY: BREAK IN MAJOR PIPELINE TRIGGERS STAGE 4 ALERT; OUTDOOR WATERING AND 
WASHING OF CARS FORBIDDEN. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred thousand residents south and east of San Diego were admonished 
Saturday to reduce their water consumption by at least half -- and for some 
neighborhoods to brace for the possibility of intermittent water stoppages -- 
because of a break in one of the five main aqueducts that bring imported water 
to San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Three water districts that serve suburban cities and rural neighborhoods 
declared Stage 4 water emergencies, banning outdoor watering and car washing 
and asking customers to cut back on domestic water use indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials were also turning off water meters that serve crop irrigation 
lines and construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the rupture of the 84-inch aqueduct -- which normally pours 
70-million gallons of water daily into the area -- might not be repaired until 
Friday. Workers are awaiting a replacement 20-foot steel pipe section now being 
fabricated in Los Angeles. "And once it's delivered, we'll work around the 
clock to get it in," said Lester Snow, general manager of the San Diego County 
Water Authority, which sells wholesale water to the county's individual public 
water districts. 
</P>
<P>
He said cause of Friday's break in the reinforced concrete pipe, situated in 
the Scripps Ranch area just south of the Miramar Reservoir, was still unknown 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Snow said lessons are being learned from the incident, such as how San Diego 
might fare if an earthquake ruptured one or more of the five pipelines that 
bring imported water into San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good illustration of what we'd have to do if we had an earthquake -- 
by asking the public to immediately reduce its water consumption and by asking 
the various water agencies to share their water through interconnections," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While officials on Saturday said they couldn't accurately measure to what 
degree customers were reducing water consumption, they said the cooperative 
interconnections between the agencies were operating well. 
</P>
<P>
Among those affected by the waterline break were residents of the cities of 
Santee, El Cajon, La Mesa and Lemon Grove, and the unincorporated communities 
of Rancho San Diego, Spring Valley, Lakeside, Alpine and Otay alongside the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
Within the city of San Diego itself, only residents in the northern suburb of 
Rancho Bernardo might experience a drop in water pressure, Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
While Snow said there should be no serious water shortages if customers cut 
back on water and the affected agencies are able to buy water from neighboring 
districts -- as they were doing on Saturday -- other water officials still made 
dire pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a Stage 4 alert," said Leslie Melenchuk, spokesperson for the Padre 
Dam Municipal Water District. "And there is no Stage 5. This is as bad as it 
gets." 
</P>
<P>
Said Charlie Cassens, spokesman for the Otay Water District, the hardest hit: 
"We have enough water in our storage tanks to keep us until Wednesday, but we 
could run out of water, unless we get every customer to cut back to only the 
most essential water use. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some areas in our district that will experience lower water 
pressure, and there is the possibility of intermittent interruptions in our 
water service as we do some creative 'valving' to keep our reservoirs from 
going dry." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Otay and Padre Dam Municipal Water Districts were buying water from 
the Helix Water District, which also relied on the broken water line but which 
has several weeks' worth of water stored in its Lake Jennings reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have plenty of water -- if the weather stays cool and people are 
cooperative," said Shirley Massie, spokeswoman for the Helix Water District. 
"We're just scurrying about, trying to get water to the other two districts." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Helix was supplying 20-million gallons of water to the Padre Dam 
district, accounting for about half it's daily average consumption, and between 
6- and 8-million gallons of water to Otay, accounting for about 25% of its 
daily average water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The Otay district was also drawing some water from the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But, sitting literally at the end of the water pipeline from Northern 
California to the Mexican border, the Otay district officials said they weren't 
bluffing when asking customers to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get the word out to everybody that this is no drill, or the 
result of the drought or any political maneuvering," Cassens said. "This is an 
actual, physical break in a main artery that brings imported water to San Diego 
County. This is most certainly an example of what could happen to the region in 
an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Water district employees were called in to work on Saturday -- and most of them 
were sent right back out to area shopping centers, where they put flyers on 
cars that read: "WATER EMERGENCY." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that water supplies are limited and that mandatory restrictions are 
being enforced, the flyer ended with this warning: 
</P>
<P>
"Water use must be cut back 50% to 75% until further notice!!" 
</P>
<P>
Said Cassens, "If there's a fire, we could be sucking dry tanks in no time." 
</P>
<P>
He said enforcement officers were patrolling the district to look for 
water-wasting scofflaws, and he called on residents to take action if they see 
people not taking the matter seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, people will take this seriously and spread the word. If they see 
someone wasting water in any way, shape or form, we hope they'll try to educate 
them not to waste it. It's all our water, and nobody has more rights to it than 
anyone else."

EXCOMMUNICATED MORMON FEMINIST PLANS TO BUILD A WORLD OF HER OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN GOESSL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

ALBUQUERQUE, N. M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sonia Johnson's life took a dramatic turn after she was excommunicated a decade 
ago for supporting the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Devastated at first, the one-time devout Mormon became a lesbian and an 
activist, lecturing and writing for feminist causes. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's setting out to make her own world. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of what my mother said, 'If you want something done right, do it 
yourself,' " Johnson said. "Why don't we just do it? We're going to try to 
figure out how we would make a world, how would we make a society." 
</P>
<P>
The "we" is a group of lesbians planning an experimental community based on a 
simple philosophy that Johnson is sure will be misunderstood: Each member does 
what she wants to do all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to trust that our desires are wholesome and good and that our feelings 
reflect those desires," she said. "We want to make a world based on women's 
values, and we're adamant in only doing what we want to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 54, and for the rest of my life I'm going to do what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson envisions a society based on peace, love, harmony, joy and laughter -- 
and work. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying theory is that women will want to work if their duties are in 
harmony with their values, and that they will delight in doing it because it 
will suit them. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for a new society is Johnson's latest endeavor since the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints excommunicated her in 1979 for opposing 
church authority by actively working for the ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Distraught at first, Johnson says now that her ouster from the church and a 
painful divorce shortly after led her into a fulfilling career as a speaker and 
author. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great boon that the Mormons gave me this new profession," said 
Johnson, a former university professor with a doctorate in English education. 
"They excommunicated me to shut me up, and really they just gave me a forum. 
Women don't get that much poetic justice, so I just revel in it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson ran for President in 1984 on both the Citizens Party and the Peace and 
Freedom Party tickets, and got 71,947 votes. Two years earlier, she ran for 
president of the National Organization for Women and finished second, with 40% 
of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson today regards NOW as a white, middle-class, professional organization 
that tries to get women into the mainstream of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want mainstream," she said. "I want to make another stream." 
</P>
<P>
"Women have been trying to get men to change the world, saying they've got to 
do right by us," she said. "Activism in the women's movement has been to try to 
get men to change things, but this is the way men do worlds. They know the 
problems, but on the whole, they think the world is pretty amazing. We're 
asking the wrong people to change things." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and her group of six or seven women are looking for a site for their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
She is sure they can successfully divvy up duties according to what each wants 
to do. Some will want to grow vegetables, she said. Others might want to build 
or cook or paint or clean or landscape or fix a leaky faucet. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson envisions other communities based on the same philosophy. Hers would 
focus on gay women because that's where her interests lie, but she sees other 
mini-environments made up of heterosexuals or of gay men. 
</P>
<P>
The communities could interact, for example, by supplying vegetables to those 
whose residents didn't want to grow crops or by doing carpentry where others 
lacked either the skill or the desire to build. 
</P>
<P>
Her theory leaves room for jobs no one would want to do. How many people, for 
instance, really want to clean toilets? 
</P>
<P>
Suppose, Johnson said, that each woman in the community checks out her feelings 
and finds that, nope, cleaning toilets doesn't fit in. 
</P>
<P>
"But, because these women believe that their desires are perfect guides to 
behavior, none of them says, 'It's got to be done,' " she wrote last spring in 
Woman of Power magazine. "Trusting their feelings and knowing that they spring 
directly from their values, they realize that since none of them wants to clean 
it, something is wrong with the toilet, not with them." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, toilets are too high for most women, Johnson said, and they 
waste countless gallons of water. A toilet also takes "marvelous, 
scientifically unreproducible organic matter . . . and carts it off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The women thus could decide to replace the conventional toilet with custom-made 
composting toilets, she says.

RAGE FUELS FATHER'S OBSESSION OVER AIR CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM: THE PARENT OF A PAN AM FLIGHT 103 VICTIM RELENTLESSLY PURSUES AN 
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: 'WHY?'

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Swire is a country doctor whose days and evenings are devoted to his 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
His nights belong to his obsession: airport security and the bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103, which killed his daughter, Flora. 
</P>
<P>
"Why, Oh why, Flora?" 
</P>
<P>
Swire wrote that on his briefcase, around a circular photograph of his 
firstborn. In frequent meetings with government officials, he makes sure that 
they see it. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see their hackles rising when they see a person they've allowed to be 
killed. I don't see why they shouldn't see it," said the soft-spoken, 
gray-haired physician. 
</P>
<P>
Flora Swire, a happy medical student, a gifted artist and musician, was 
traveling to the United States to spend Christmas with her American boyfriend. 
She was one of 270 people who died when the plane blew up at 7:04 p.m. on Dec. 
21, 1988, and rained wreckage on the Scottish town of Lockerbie. 
</P>
<P>
It was the day before her 24th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 21 months since, her father has had periods of intense depression and 
rage. But his campaign to point out security flaws, bring the terrorists to 
justice and reform British airport security has been relentless. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Swire will be in Dumfries, 10 miles west of Lockerbie, for the 
opening of a public Scottish inquiry into the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"Rage is my secret weapon. When I am sitting at this desk, it's 2 a.m. and I 
have another letter to write but I want to go to bed, I just think about that 
flight, that warm airplane at four minutes past 7, and it makes me so angry 
that the adrenaline starts going and I can last for a few more hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The desk is Swire's communications center: a large computer, fax machine and 
desk telephone to supplement a mobile phone tucked in the breast pocket of his 
gray suit. 
</P>
<P>
There are many photographs of Flora -- smiling with alert, playful eyes -- in 
the Swires' sandstone house overlooking the Malvern Hills of central England. 
</P>
<P>
A son, William, is taking a year off before college. Catherine, who saw her 
sister off at Heathrow Airport, still lives at home. 
</P>
<P>
"She was excited about Flora's trip and even thought about buying a ticket 
too," Swire said. He took a deep breath, fighting to keep the voice steady. 
</P>
<P>
"I came within a hair's breadth of losing both of them." 
</P>
<P>
The Swires keep a comfortable house, where the Burmese cat has free rein over 
the Oriental rugs, the dog's long tail slaps against antiques, and dinner in 
the kitchen is beef stew and home-grown fruit. 
</P>
<P>
But talk around the table is about Mohammad Abu Talb, the Palestinian terrorist 
serving a life sentence in Sweden for bombings against American and Israeli 
targets in Europe. Lockerbie investigators have identified Talb as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone call from a Swedish journalist takes Swire from the table. 
</P>
<P>
"A (doctor's) family is used to being interrupted at the dinner table but this 
is just unbelievable," said Jane Swire, her voice trailing off, her eyes cast 
down. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry beginning Monday, the Scottish version of an inquest, is not the 
wide-ranging investigation that Swire has been demanding. But he intends to 
spend as much of the opening week in Dumfries as his practice allows. He hopes 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a thorn in the flesh of the British government. Thorns fester and I am 
determined not to leave off until we have some answers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Swire wants to know why Department of Transport warnings about a cassette 
recorder bomb like the one that blew up Flight 103 reached the airport security 
staff after his daughter was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Why was a warning of a terrorist threat given to U.S. Embassy staffers in 
Helsinki, Finland, and other cities but not to the public? 
</P>
<P>
Why has the British government refused an independent inquiry, even after a 
U.S. presidential commission reported in May that the disaster could have been 
prevented? 
</P>
<P>
There were 259 passengers on the flight, including 31 British citizens. As 
spokesman for U.K. Families Flight 103, Swire frequently travels to the United 
States for meetings with the two active family groups there. 
</P>
<P>
In May, he risked arrest by flying to New York with a fake bomb in his suitcase 
to dramatize his belief that airport security is still too lax. 
</P>
<P>
Swire, 54, learned about explosives during army service in the Royal Engineers. 
He says it took him six hours to buy the parts and duplicate the terrorist's 
bomb, substituting marzipan for Semtex, the Czechoslovakian-made plastic 
explosive. 
</P>
<P>
"When I smuggled the bomb on the flight to New York, and we flew up over 
Scotland, and climbed to 31,000 feet, it was a strange sensation that the other 
passengers didn't have a clue that there was a fake bomb in the hold." 
</P>
<P>
Swire's record for interviews is 24 in one day and his news conferences are as 
well-run as any politician's. 
</P>
<P>
A scholarship in Flora's memory has been established at Nottingham University. 
But the young woman may be most vividly remembered in the dark circles under 
her father's eyes, a sign of his determination. 
</P>
<P>
Swire said he no longer wants vengeance by having people fired, but desires 
improved airport security to prevent another disaster. He admits the goal is 
distant. 
</P>
<P>
Swire said his initial rage was stoked by officials who treated him as an 
ignorant outsider. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me livid," he said. "I had seen dead bodies lying in pieces in a 
mausoleum in Lockerbie. The experts didn't know what the death of 270 people 
looks like and they never would. That's why they can forget it and have such a 
lackadaisical approach to security." 
</P>
<P>
The Swires traveled to Lockerbie a few days after the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Families were told they could not see the bodies because it would be too 
upsetting, a policy that Swire says goes against psychological practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a doc, I pulled some strings and the pathologist put my daughter's body 
aside for me," Swire said. 
</P>
<P>
There were flowers around her body in the makeshift mortuary, and the 
pathologist had clipped a lock of Flora's thick, black hair to give to her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind was blank and I half expected to feel rage," Swire said. "But I just 
felt waves of sadness passing over me, wave after wave, a flying carpet of 
sadness."

TOURISM IN EGYPT A CASUALTY OF GULF CRISIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As July ended, Egypt was celebrating a tourism boom -- with no end in sight. 
There were almost 3 million visitors last year, and officials had visions of 5 
million by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt finally was returning as an international tourist mecca after years of 
Middle East uncertainty that had devastated an industry as old as the pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Aug. 2, Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is an industry sensitive to regional politics," said Fuad Sultan, 
Egypt's tourism minister. "If you're scared to travel to a country, you don't 
come." 
</P>
<P>
And many are not coming. Overall tourism is down 40%. Tourism from the United 
States has dried up almost overnight. Holy Land tours to Egypt and Israel are 
being canceled en masse. 
</P>
<P>
"One man, Saddam Hussein, has managed to convince the world that the whole 
Middle East is embroiled in a holy war, Muslims killing Christians, another 
crusade," Sultan said. 
</P>
<P>
"In one day Saddam Hussein undid what we took five years to build: a large 
American tourist market. He convinced tourists that God and Satan were slugging 
it out on the streets of Cairo, that Christians would be killed if they came to 
a Muslim country. 
</P>
<P>
"What rubbish!" 
</P>
<P>
Sultan said his envoys are spreading the word that Egypt, 1,000 miles from 
Iraq, is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"Every tourist who doesn't come here because of this man's echoes, his mouthing 
off, is letting Saddam Hussein win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Annual tourist figures, calculated every July, were being readied for public 
release at the time of the Iraqi invasion. Sultan said 2.8 million visitors 
deposited more than $2.5 billion into Egypt's debt-ridden economy in the 
previous 12 months, an all-time high. Almost 150,000 Americans and nearly 1.2 
million Europeans visited Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Sultan said cancellations were few early in August. The industry was in good 
shape because of a large number of well-to-do Arab families spending the summer 
in Cairo. Pre-paid Western tour groups also still came. 
</P>
<P>
But by this month officials feared the worst as they looked ahead to the 
beginning of Egypt's major tourist season in October. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to work to pick up European tourists to make up for the disappearing 
Americans," Sultan said. "We knew that people weren't coming because they were 
scared. We realized there is nothing to be done for a tourist who is panicked, 
afraid he can't get back home if fighting occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is something we can do for a tourist who wants to come but has a few 
doubts. We can persuade him to come. This is what's happening. We are taking 
steps to reassure the Americans they should really come ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Alia Noor is the Cairo-based national sales manager for the Hilton Hotel chain. 
She said American cancellations are running about 50% so far but that her staff 
is on the telephone daily to ensure that European charter flights don't cancel. 
</P>
<P>
"So far it's worked," she said. "We keep telling people to come here and see 
for yourself. Cairo's great." 
</P>
<P>
Hassan Kamy, head of a large Egyptian tourist company, blames sensationalism in 
the foreign news media for slanting Middle East events. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a long way from Iraq, from the action," Kamy said. "Nothing's happening 
here. But the media, particularly the American media, have sensationalized 
what's happening in Egypt by 200% at least. 
</P>
<P>
"We're suffering. I keep saying to other travel agents we must get out, call 
our agents around the world, tell them Egypt is fine, bring the people." 
</P>
<P>
Tension in the Middle East affects tourism according to the nationality of the 
tourist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Europeans have come despite the problems. The Germans are great. They're 
stubborn. They come anyhow. The Asians are far away and plan and pay ahead. So 
they're still coming," Kamy said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said there are two critical areas: international conferences and 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Conferences. Forget them. And the Americans. We've been in touch with our 
American travel agencies. They say they want to come ahead even with smaller 
groups, but nobody will come."

SURVIVORS OF ATTACKS FACE SECOND HURDLE: FEAR;

VIOLENCE: SEVERE INJURY MAY BE ONLY A FRACTION OF THE ORDEAL. TRAUMA TO THE 
PERSONALITY MAY NEVER HEAL.

People stare at the scars on his throat as he waits in the market checkout 
line. Sometimes strangers ask him if he has a cold; sometimes they ask if he 
fought in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
He never served in Vietnam, but he says yes, he did, because he knows from past 
experience that they won't want to hear how he got the scars. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that, eight years ago, a stranger jammed a knife into his gut, 
spilling the intestines out of his slight frame, then slit his throat as he lay 
calling for help. It's those details that people don't want to hear of -- 
details that still rattle him, still cause his hands to shake uncontrollably, 
hands with nails bitten down to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The sandy-haired young father is just one of several million people who have 
been victims of aggravated assaults in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The attack swept away his optimism and trust in others, his devil-may-care 
attitude. Left instead is fear -- fear so real that after telling his story, he 
asked that his real name and that of his hometown be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
"We live with the realization that it doesn't happen to somebody else," said 
the boyish, 33-year-old we'll call Larry Roberts. "We know that people will 
hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Murders may steal the headlines, but the number of serious nonfatal assaults 
dwarfs the number of killings. Assault victims survive, but often they are 
changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
"The trauma of having looked at the jaws of death is something that is very 
rough to deal with," said John Stein, deputy director of the National 
Organization for Victims Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Some 559,270 people -- roughly the population of Columbus, Ohio -- were injured 
in aggravated assaults last year alone, according to the National Crime Survey, 
which annually interviews members of some 49,000 households to extrapolate 
nationwide figures. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 1.1 million others were the targets of attempted assaults 
with a weapon -- were shot at and missed, for example. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of June 6, 1982, Roberts was on leave from the Navy. He was 
interested mainly in getting in one last day of scuba diving before his 
aircraft carrier departed in two days. 
</P>
<P>
He was pitching a tent in a park when two strangers approached and struck up a 
conversation with him. They seemed friendly enough. 
</P>
<P>
Then, without warning, one of them stabbed Roberts in the abdomen and ran off 
with his scuba gear, wedding ring and $4. 
</P>
<P>
"When I thought he was gone, I started to holler for help," Roberts said with a 
catch in his now-raspy voice. "He came back through the woods and he tilted my 
head back and slit my throat twice. And then he tied my feet together and my 
hands back to two trees." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts eventually worked free, dragged and himself about 250 feet to a dirt 
road, holding in his intestines and pressing his chin downward to keep the 
blood from spurting out. Help finally arrived the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
He spent 10 months in a hospital and had at least 10 operations. 
</P>
<P>
The fear took over when he emerged from the hospital on April 18, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to take a gun with me wherever I went," he said. "I was scared to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, Roberts moved his family six times. 
</P>
<P>
"Something would happen, something would trigger me and we'd be gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They stopped running five years ago in rural Maryland so that their elder 
daughter could start school and enjoy a semblance of a normal life. Four years 
ago, Roberts and his wife had a second daughter. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, his attacker pleaded guilty to attempted murder and sentenced 
to 10 years in prison. He served six years, then was released as a model 
prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts still fears him -- even though he believes his fear is irrational. (He 
also insisted that the assailant's name not be used, in part because he doesn't 
want to antagonize him.) 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Roberts' home is guarded by a large, loud watchdog named Norad, after 
the national early-warning system for nuclear attacks. At night, the house is 
awash in light. Two sheriff's deputies live across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and his wife never employ baby-sitters because they don't trust 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
The attack destroyed Roberts' career plans. The Navy discharged him because he 
could no longer perform his job. 
</P>
<P>
Desperate to make up for lost time, Roberts pushed himself too hard. He has had 
a drinking problem. He spent two months in a psychiatric hospital last year. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he takes things more slowly. He teaches diving part time while attending 
college. 
</P>
<P>
And after years of shying away from the world, he now tells his story to police 
groups. He hopes to make the officers sensitive to crime victims' needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim is a piece of evidence," said Andrew Turner, a criminal justice 
instructor at Wor Wic Tech Community College and a former Maryland police 
officer who has arranged some of Roberts' talks. 
</P>
<P>
"If the guy survived, you had a good case. He could come and testify against 
the perpetrator." Turner said. "Police don't see a guy healed up" yet still in 
need of emotional support. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts finds telling his story therapeutic, despite the toll it takes. He has 
established a network of people who can help him when he cracks from the 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to Roberts that he controls the impact of the attack, not the 
other way around, but he conceded: "It has given my life a different 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
He has yet another fear: AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts had numerous blood transfusions in 1982, before donated blood could be 
screened for the deadly disease. He refuses to be tested for AIDS now. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to die of it," he said with a grimace, "I don't want to know 
about it."

REMAINS OF EARLY MIGRANTS BEING STUDIED IN ALASKA 
</P>

KODIAK, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The remains left by some of the earliest migrants from Asia to Alaska and the 
remains of the first Russian colony in North America are being simultaneously 
uncovered on Alaska's Kodiak Island. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said Kodiak Island, jutting out of a volcano-formed archipelago 
in the Gulf of Alaska, is proving to be a treasure trove of artifacts left by 
North America's earliest settlers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being in a candy shop. There are sites everywhere," said Philomena 
Knecht, a doctoral candidate at Harvard University who leads one of several 
excavations on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Knecht's site, in the community of Chiniak on the east side of the island, 
shows evidence that the migrants from Asia had developed sophisticated tools to 
hunt marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
That makes them more advanced than the earliest Bering Strait migrants, who 
settled along what is now the Aleutian Island chain about 10,000 years ago. 
They gathered food along the shorelines and fished with simple techniques, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, she and her workers have uncovered the floors of 
several prehistoric homes, sea mammal bones, human bone fragments, hunting 
tools and pieces of a seal-oil lamp -- strong evidence, she said, that the 
people were ancestors of today's Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence indicates that these were the among the first Alaskans to learn 
maritime hunting skills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The site, 6,500 years old, is one of the earliest traces in Alaska of a 
maritime culture termed Ocean Bay by archeologists, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a definite link to Asia. There's just no question that these people are 
coming in from Asia," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimally, we're looking at the earliest ancestors of Eskimos and Aleuts," 
said Rick Knecht, Philomena's husband and an archeologist also specializing in 
the Ocean Bay culture. 
</P>
<P>
While Philomena Knecht scrapes away at her prehistoric Aleut site, her husband 
works farther south on the island, uncovering the earliest Russian settlement 
in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Knecht, working for the region's Aleut Corporation and for the University 
of Alaska at Anchorage, has joined forces with a prominent Soviet archeologist 
to excavate the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first Russian settlement in Alaska," Knecht said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the site was believed to have been established in 1784 by an expedition 
led by Grigor Shelekhov of the Russian American Co. 
</P>
<P>
Knecht said archeologists have known since the 1960s about the Russian 
settlement site on Kodiak Island but have only recently gathered the experts 
and the funding to conduct the excavation. 
</P>
<P>
The project, begun this year, is a joint U.S.-Soviet effort that grew out of 
renewed ties between the Soviet Union and its former colony, which Russia sold 
to the United States in 1867.

TAIWANESE BATTLE RAMPANT SMUGGLING

<TEXT>
<P>
Their cargoes range from the exotic to the erotic, from desperate job seekers 
to girls and guns. But a crackdown by Taiwan may dent smugglers' 
multimillion-dollar business. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing boats lurking in the waters off Taiwan smuggle enough wares to stock a 
bazaar, enough prostitutes to fill dozens of brothels and enough workers to 
staff many of the island's labor-starved factories. 
</P>
<P>
Security officials and analysts say watermelon seeds, rooster testicles 
(considered a delicacy), medicinal wines, peanuts, garlic, mushrooms, guns, 
girls, laborers and drugs are pouring into Taiwan from China, just a short boat 
ride away. 
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has about 150 fishing ports and each one can have several hundred 
fishing boats. There is no way of knowing how many smuggling cases we don't 
catch," said Jim C. H. Huang, inspector general of customs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fact that most fishermen at some point have smuggled. Because of 
pollution and other reasons, it's hard to make a living just from fishing . . . 
so they do other activities." 
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan's new premier, Hau Pei-tsun, formerly the country's top general, has 
vowed to crack down on the smuggling business and has bolstered the 
anti-smuggling drive with 20,000 additional troops. 
</P>
<P>
Nanliao Harbor, just up the coast from the northwestern port of Hsinchu and 
only 75 miles from China, has been declared a special military zone with strict 
control on entry and exit. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere else on Taiwan's long coast soldiers equipped with rifles, radar, 
night-vision glasses, spotlights and dogs play a cat-and-mouse game with Taiwan 
fishing boats that approach the shore, drop off their cargo and speed away. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the smuggling trade flourishes because Taiwan and China are still 
officially at war 41 years after the Nationalist Party fled to the island, 
formerly Formosa, in defeat from communist victory in China's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan bans direct trade and investment in China, and while it tolerates 
indirect trade through third countries, especially Hong Kong, many businessmen 
want the convenience and economy of direct shipping back and forth across the 
Taiwan Strait. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the extent of the smuggling could be measured in the number of 
fishing boats ordered. At Nanliao Harbor the number of boats jumped from 80 to 
200 in just one year, the economist said, despite a dying fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
With so many people profitably employed in smuggling, the new crackdown has not 
been universally welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
When Nanliao was declared a military control zone, the Hsinchu City Council, 
which has jurisdiction over the harbor, canceled two days of meetings to 
protest being singled out. 
</P>
<P>
"Up and down the coast more or less all harbors are involved in smuggling," 
said council chairman Yang Chin-mu. "We received many telephone calls from 
citizens complaining about the inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say underworld gangs are entrenched in the smuggling business, running 
fleets of boats. 
</P>
<P>
Smuggling guns from China is tremendously profitable because of demand from 
Taiwan's organized crime gangs. In the first four months of 1990 police found 
349 guns from China, compared to 687 in all of 1989. Many more go undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
A fishing boat operator can make a profit of $30,000 per trip. 
</P>
<P>
But smuggling people can be equally lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
A worker in China pays $500 to $700 to be smuggled into Taiwan, and a boat may 
take 50 or more per trip. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone on the mainland that is a huge sum of money, but illegal immigrants 
can earn that in a month working in a Taiwan factory. 
</P>
<P>
"The first words out of their mouth are always, 'We came because it's so easy 
to make money in Taiwan. Taiwan is so rich,' " said an army captain who heads a 
unit aimed at preventing illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Security forces said they knew of more than 2,000 illegal immigrants smuggled 
from China so far this year, twice the number they recorded in the whole of 
last year.

PROGRESSIVE DUTCH PRISONS TRY HUMANE PUNISHMENT

HAARLEM, Netherlands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brightly painted blue door opens, revealing a clean, narrow room with a bed 
along one wall. A radio is fixed into the opposite wall above bookshelves and 
there is a toilet in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Sunshine streams through a window, which has no bars even though the room is a 
cell. The room houses one of 230 inmates at a remand prison in this town west 
of Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
"People go to prison as a punishment, but we try to ensure that being here 
doesn't cause any more harm than is necessary," prison warden John van Putten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Built in the last century, "De Koepel" (The Dome) -- the name comes from its 
distinctive glass roof -- has just been refurbished for $20 million with work 
and recreation areas updated and visiting rooms improved. 
</P>
<P>
It typifies the relaxed Dutch penal system, which guarantees each prisoner his 
own cell -- for which he can rent a television and where perks can include 
private conjugal visits. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry puts the prison population at just 7,000, out of nearly 15 
million people in the Netherlands. That is less than half the number per capita 
of Belgium, France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
De Koepel, near Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, houses inmates from up to 50 
nationalities. They include many drug couriers who were attracted by the 
country's renowned liberal approach to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Possession of soft drugs has effectively been decriminalized in the Netherlands 
but cocaine and heroin smugglers face lengthy jail sentences if caught. 
</P>
<P>
Van Putten estimates that some 40% of his prisoners are dependent on hard 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs are a growing problem and it also cannot be denied that prisoners are 
getting more violent, but compared to other countries we can't really 
complain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his colleagues, he is loath to contemplate a stricter regime for 
violent inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"Why punish everybody for one bad apple? If you make things tougher, you only 
create a vicious circle of violence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
De Koepel's inmates are free to dress as they please and can spend large chunks 
of the day out of their cells. 
</P>
<P>
"Prisoners can work a half day. If they don't want to work, they stay in their 
cells. It's up to them," Van Putten said. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoons they choose from activities including sports, educational 
courses or painting and pottery courses. 
</P>
<P>
The system is not cheap. It can cost more than $115 a day to keep a prisoner, 
and the ratio of staff to inmates is high. 
</P>
<P>
Van Putten's total staff of 160 includes 100 guards. He emphasizes the care 
taken to select and train guards. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to hire people, we have an open day and they come and talk to me 
and other officers. In the end, out of 100 applicants, we maybe end up taking 
three," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young recruits are given time off to study alongside nurses and care workers 
for a professional qualification. 
</P>
<P>
Van Putten also avoids over-reliance on young officers. 
</P>
<P>
"With young men you tend to create a macho culture," he said. "If you hire 
older people who've worked elsewhere, then maybe the prisoners look up to them 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Communication is seen as vital, with inmates represented on committees to raise 
complaints with prison authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Van Putten sees a lack of communication as one of the main failings in other 
penal systems, such as in Britain, where earlier this year there were riots at 
Manchester's Strangeways prison and inmate protests at several others. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent a day in Strangeways and saw prisoners cleaning a wing. The warders 
didn't speak to them all day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Putten also said he believes prison disturbances are symptomatic of a 
violent strain in British society, which has also spawned race riots and soccer 
hooliganism over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
For him the Dutch approach is vastly preferable, although he remains doubtful 
about the chances of prison improving people. 
</P>
<P>
"If you believe we are here to improve people, then I think we fail," he said. 
"But if people want to improve, they have the chance."

RUMOR-CONTROL HOT LINE HELPS SORT FACT FROM FANTASY 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Sorry, sir, there are no plans for an underwater shopping mall in the Inner 
Harbor. No, ma'am, a highway is not coming through your living room. And no, 
pull tabs from soda cans and empty cigarette packs do not pay for kidney 
dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
For 22 years, operators at the city's rumor control center have been handing 
out facts and dispelling rumors for confused or curious citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"The rumor was it would be an underwater mall and they would have a restaurant 
and you could pick out your dinner from behind the glass," said Tom Saunders, 
who has worked for the hot line for 10 years. "We had contractors calling up 
wanting to build it." 
</P>
<P>
Rumor control hot lines were opened in several major cities in the 1960s to 
ease tension in the wake of race riots. Although the violence of that era has 
passed, Baltimore still operates its hot line, and some cities that dropped 
theirs are reviving the idea, Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia recently opened a rumor control hot line after a black man was 
shot to death by a Korean shopkeeper, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides handling frivolous rumors, Baltimore officials said, the hot line keeps 
the public informed about topics that could affect health or safety -- and 
helps the city to keep in touch with its residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a place people can call to get good information, but also cast a straw 
vote, in effect, for things the city should be doing to enhance the community," 
City Council President Mary Pat Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't try to appease people. We give them the facts from a creditable 
source," said Lillian Jones, head of the community division of the city's 
community relations commission, which operates the hot line. 
</P>
<P>
Calls from people expressing a desire to heal race relations helped lead to a 
scheduled meeting of community leaders in November. The calls were received 
after several apparently racially motivated incidents this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, one of the six workers in Baltimore's community relations office 
takes a turn staffing the hot line, answering questions and collecting rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the rumors are in reference to news events. People receive 
misinformation or bits and pieces, and they call rumor control," Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers try to keep abreast of current events, he said. A bulletin board in the 
small downtown office is littered with news articles, flyers and information 
about events that have been brought to the staff's attention. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors called in by the public range from the far-fetched to the mundane. 
Health, safety and neighborhood issues make up the majority of calls. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most unusual rumors called in recently involved the Ku Klux Klan's 
purported ownership of a popular line of sweat suits. 
</P>
<P>
"The rumor was the guy who owned it was on a television show and he said blacks 
will overpay for anything," Saunders said. "He said he was a member of the klan 
and decided to put out an expensive sweat suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out a Jewish person owned the company, therefore he wouldn't be a 
member of the Ku Klux Klan." 
</P>
<P>
The hot line still gets calls from people wondering where to send empty 
cigarette packs and pull tabs from soda cans to help pay for kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
"People have trash bags of cigarette packs. I run into people myself at the 
barbershop who ask for cigarette packages and pull tabs," Saunders said. "They 
swear to me they know what they are talking about."

PENAL COLONY FOR DRUG CRIMINALS STUDIED;

PRISONS: A CONGRESSMAN SUGGESTS SHIPPING OFFENDERS TO A REMOTE PACIFIC ISLAND.

Return to Alcatraz? How about Devil's Island? 
</P>
<P>
That may not be precisely what the House Armed Services Committee has in mind. 
But tucked away in the panel's report on this year's defense authorization bill 
is an unusual, if not altogether novel, idea for dealing with the prison 
overcrowding problem: Ship drug criminals off to "extremely remote Pacific 
islands." 
</P>
<P>
The two islands that the committee has in mind are well known to Americans with 
a sense of history -- Midway and Wake islands. Midway, a 1-by-1.5-mile island, 
1,150 miles northwest of Hawaii, was the site of one of the decisive U.S. naval 
victories during World War II. Wake, a three-square-mile atoll 2,300 miles west 
of Hawaii, was where President Harry S. Truman conferred with Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur during the height of the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the tiny U.S. possessions have slipped back to obscurity, used by 
the Defense Department for emergency airfields and communications stations. 
</P>
<P>
Given the "shortage of available space for convicted drug offenders," the 
congressional committee proposes turning the islands into drug prisons where 
inmates could be put to work. 
</P>
<P>
"The convicted drug offenders could be required to accomplish the duties that 
contractors now perform," the committee said in its report on the $284-billion 
defense bill, which the House passed earlier this month. The Senate passed a 
different version; the bill is in conference committee to resolve the 
differences. The House committee's report requests that Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney study the plan and report back by next March. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is the brainchild of committee member Rep. Richard Ray (D-Ga.), who 
insists that sending drug criminals to faraway islands makes more sense than 
simply building more federal prisons. As Ray envisions it, the Pacific islands 
would be reserved for volunteers only; convicts who signed up to go would be 
promised a one-third reduction in their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much chance they're going to get anything but rehabilitated on two 
small islands like these," said Ray. "You can't go anywhere. . . . You won't be 
interrupted by families coming to visit every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Ray, who thought up the idea after visiting Midway and Wake during committee 
trips, said he recently outlined it to a group of local sheriffs and to police 
chiefs in his district. "I got a standing ovation," he said. "They thought it 
was a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some law enforcement experts acknowledged that Ray was indisputably correct on 
at least one point: The islands are isolated enough to deter any thoughts of 
escape. Neither has any native inhabitants. Midway, for example, is home to 12 
U.S. military officers, 210 contractors, most of them Asians, and an estimated 
1.5 million fowl -- led by the gooney birds, albatrosses best known for parking 
themselves in large numbers along the main runway that runs the entire length 
of the island. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, called the 
idea "a giant step backward" -- a return to the days when the British shipped 
their hardened criminals off to Australia or the French sent their convicts to 
Devil's Island off the coast of South America. Leaving aside the likely 
exorbitant cost of flying prisoners and supplies back and forth, Sterling said 
the proposal reflects the all too common tendency to see drug criminals as 
"subhuman." 
</P>
<P>
"This is astonishing," he said. "It takes penology back two centuries."

CRISIS REVIVES OIL INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: THOUGH PRODUCTION IS RISING, FEW EXPECT A RETURN TO THE COUNTY'S 
PETROLEUM HEYDEY. 
</P>

<P>
Ventura County's oil industry isn't ready to declare the return of the boom 
times of the past, but the pace has quickened perceptibly for some of the 
county's production and oil field service companies since upheavals in the 
Middle East sent prices zooming upward. 
</P>
<P>
"We're calling in more crews to increase production in some wells and to bring 
others that were marginal back into production," said Murdock Baker, vice 
president of Seneca Resources Corp. of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hasn't yet expanded his payroll of about 35 employees, but has 
contracted with other companies that supply crews for this type of work. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt but that more people are working in the fields now than two 
months ago," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Aug. 2, when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait and 
triggered an embargo of those countries' exports, Seneca was receiving about 
$11.65 a barrel for the oil pumped from its 150 wells in the northern part of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the price for that same California light crude had risen to 
$32.35 -- not as much as the record amounts being paid for West Texas crude, 
but enough to arouse renewed interest in Ventura County wells that were idle as 
recently as two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Oil from the Ventura Avenue/Rincon Field, which is slightly heavier than that 
produced in the northern part of the county and therefore more costly to 
refine, was selling at $30.60 during the week. 
</P>
<P>
"In May, June and July, when oil dropped to $11 a barrel, we shut down any 
wells that needed major repair work," Baker said. "You couldn't justify the 
expense. Now, some of that work is worth doing." 
</P>
<P>
Illustrating how narrow profit margins had become, Carol Currie, a spokeswoman 
for the California Independent Petroleum Assn., said it costs a producer $8.50 
to $9.50 to get a barrel of oil -- equaling 42 gallons -- out of the ground. 
Others in the industry say the cost is actually about $15 when financing and 
other expenses are taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
Seneca, in normal times one of the county's most active exploration companies, 
is gearing up for recompletions -- drilling old wells into deeper zones -- in 
its prime production areas, the Sespe Field north of Fillmore and the Silver 
Thread Field between Santa Paula and Ojai. 
</P>

Bill Hewston, president of Measurement &amp; Control Engineering, an oil field 
service concern based in Ventura, said most of his 33 employees are working 
overtime, testing wells that previously were shut down but now are being 
readied for reactivation. 
</P>
<P>
But, like most other oil people in the county, Hewston hesitates to predict 
that the improvement in business will be long-lasting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a little increased activity, but nobody is jumping out and 
attempting to sign new leases," he said. "These prices will have to stabilize 
more than they have before that happens." 
</P>
<P>
Hewston said any increased activity among oil field developers before the end 
of the year will probably be limited to "small outfits that can adjust their 
plans and budgets more easily than the majors can." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the industry said it could take as long as six months before prices 
are considered stable enough to warrant widespread expansion or exploration. 
</P>
<P>
One small company, Fortune Petroleum Corp., based in Agoura Hills, is so 
confident about the future that it has signed a letter of intent to buy the oil 
and gas properties of a Ventura producer, Fairbanks &amp; Haas Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would double the production of Fortune, which now pumps 140 barrels a 
day from 28 wells near Fillmore and Piru. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Pasquini, Fortune's president, plans to drill for even more oil on 13 of 
his present locations that he says are proved but undeveloped. He expects to 
finance the move in two to three months when he believes prices will have 
stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
"We were barely breaking even before Kuwait," Pasquini said. "Now, we're making 
a net profit of $60,000 a month." 
</P>
<P>
While small companies such as Fortune are flourishing, neither Texaco nor 
Chevron said they plan to reverse decisions that recently reduced their staff 
operations in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The price increases have improved the picture for our production in the 
Ventura Avenue Field, but essentially we haven't changed our plans at all," 
said Mark Weller, Texaco's West Coast offshore manager. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Exxon, Arco, Chevron, Unocal and others, Texaco is a major offshore 
producer from platforms along the Ventura and Santa Barbara coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these offshore wells are already pumping at full capacity, though their 
production conceivably could be stepped up if they were drilled to deeper 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Such steps aren't likely to be taken, said G. Michael Marcy, a spokesman for 
Chevron's Ventura district operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Small companies can realize economies by boosting production quickly from, 
say, 100 barrels to 300 barrels a day," he said. "Because of the huge 
investment required, the majors are less prone to make such a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Marcy doesn't expect current developments to help resolve an environmental 
controversy that has held up production at offshore fields at Point Arguello in 
the Santa Barbara Channel. Chevron and its partners have invested $2.5 billion 
there but haven't produced a drop of oil. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of Ventura County oil, Marcy said he thinks its aging fields 
are "pretty much tapped out." Noting that his own company has sold all its 
onshore holdings in the county, he added: "There will always be an oil industry 
here, but the heyday of Ventura County oil is over." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Baldwin, acting superintendent of Cal Pacific Drilling Co. in Camarillo, 
said he expects the price for benchmark West Texas intermediate crude to 
stabilize in coming months at about $25. 
</P>
<P>
That would be about $15 below present levels and would translate to about $18 a 
barrel for oil produced in northern Ventura County. Pasquini said he thinks the 
north county price will settle at $20 to $25 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Kinnear, deputy supervisor of the California Division of Oil and Gas, 
estimates that there are about 2,500 producing oil wells in Ventura County, of 
which 900 pump fewer than 10 barrels a day. About 300 others have been shut 
down since oil prices tumbled badly in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is predicting that prices will climb so high that all the capped wells 
will be reactivated. 
</P>
<P>
So many people have left the industry that it would take years to train the 
workers needed for a major comeback, some experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hewston, 53, who has lived in the county all his life, remembers when 
"there was no question but that the top industries in this county were oil and 
agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
Farming has held its own, Hewston said, but the same can't be said for oil. 
</P>
<P>
"As recently as 15 years ago, oil companies paid 50% of this county's property 
taxes," he said. "Today, I doubt if oil accounts for more than 5% of the tax 
base." 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY: President Bush banned new oil leases off 99% of the California coast 
until the year 2000. With the threat to U.S. oil supplies from the Persian 
Gulf, should new oil drilling be allowed off the California coast? See Q&amp;A 
Monday on B2.

<P>
Rich Cleveland first tried to get through Hell Week to become a Navy SEAL in 
January. He got hypothermia and passed out from the cold. The second time, in 
March, he broke his leg. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's third try, two weeks ago, didn't begin badly. For 24 hours, he and 
the rest of Class 172 tossed 250-pound logs and then kicked them up sand berms, 
rowed and then shoulder-pressed inflated rubber rafts over their heads. They 
lay in the surf while waves pounded them, swam relay races, climbed walls and 
ropes and raced in the deep sand of Coronado's beaches. And they did not sleep. 
</P>
<P>
On the second night, Cleveland and the others were ordered into the bay. 
Cleveland, 22, remembered the hypothermia and panicked. 
</P>
<P>
For almost 20 minutes, the fully clothed men swam. As instructed, they removed 
their boots and socks in the water and tied them around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
They were ordered back to the steel pier, where they lay on the cold metal. An 
instructor hosed the men down with bay water as they did push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"Keeps them from overheating," the instructor said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Graham, a petty officer 2nd class, confessed that he had lost one of 
his boots in the bay. The group returned to the water, diving until they found 
it. Cleveland's face was pinched in fear. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the cold," the Oklahoma native said later. "And the night. . . . The 
dark has a way of taking things away. . . . I was petrified." 
</P>
<P>
For the chance to belong to the military's most elite special operation force, 
Cleveland and 57 others were going through what is widely regarded as the 
toughest military training in the United States. The program is so strenuous 
that only half of those who enroll will graduate and become SEALs, sea-air-land 
commandos. The most intense part of the 25-week training is Hell Week, a name 
that evolved over 47 years from its original name, "Motivation Week." 
</P>
<P>
During Hell Week, the recruits are almost constantly wet and cold. They lose 
their toenails and rub raw huge patches of skin. Their joints swell up like 
melons. Afraid they will be unable to put their boots back on, they rarely take 
them off. In the course of the week, the men faint, vomit and hallucinate. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had to suck up pain," said William (B.J.) Whitted, 28, a Virginia Beach 
resident who went through Hell Week with a stress fracture in each leg. "If you 
go through Hell Week, you feel a sense of superiority; you have done something 
few people could tolerate." 
</P>
<P>
As Class 172 went through Hell Week, Navy officials allowed The Times 
unprecedented access to the exercises and the men involved. Their only request 
was that instructors eligible to go on clandestine missions remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say Hell Week, which occurs during the sixth week of the 25-week 
training, is a hazing ritual that separates the determined from the doubtful. 
It is the ultimate "rite of passage to be a warrior" in the armed forces, said 
Cmdr. Larry Simmons, executive officer of the Naval Special Warfare Center. 
</P>
<P>
For those who succeed, it is not only a physical feat. They also suffer through 
mind games and mockery. Through the six days of Hell Week, the men get no more 
than three hours of sleep total. Several men in Class 172 fell asleep during 
the 15-mile paddles, waking up only after tumbling into the water. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell Week is to see how a young man operates under extreme stress. You try to 
simulate combat within super-tolerant margins of safety. They look like they 
got out of Auschwitz when it's over," said Rear Adm. George R. Worthington, 
commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command. "Nobody really dies during Hell 
Week." 
</P>
<P>
But they do get injured. Class 172 started with 79 enrolled. By Hell Week, the 
class had dropped to 58. About equal numbers quit, became physically 
incapacitated or were dismissed for being unable to hack it. Six men dropped 
out after Hell Week, an unusually low number, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before this Hell Week kicked off Sept. 16, 15 instructors gathered with SEAL 
officers in the conference room at the Special Warfare Command in Coronado for 
a "breakout brief." With the attentiveness of caterers planning a party, they 
discussed the trials the enrollees would endure, figuring in the nighttime 
water and air temperatures -- 70 and 60 degrees, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Instructors, all of them SEALs themselves, work eight-hour shifts in teams of 
six throughout the week. Because they need to stay alert, they do not keep the 
same hours as their charges, said Capt. Douglas P. Huth, commanding officer of 
the Naval Special Warfare Center. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m. Sunday, the 58 young men gathered and were assigned to black rubber 
boats. They would carry these boats everywhere they went -- including the mess 
hall -- during the next week. 
</P>
<P>
There were eight teams, grouped by height. Boat Crew 8, whose members were the 
shortest in the class, had already earned the dubious title that was to dog 
them throughout the week: the Smurfs. 
</P>
<P>
As the boat crews assembled, the shouting began. 
</P>
<P>
"You are late! That is no way to start Hell Week!" screamed one instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Another chimed in: "Class 172 is starting Hell Week on the wrong foot! I can't 
believe this! I can't believe you people are no more motivated than that!" 
</P>
<P>
In a desperate, unsuccessful effort to impress their instructors, the class 
gave the trademark shout: "HOO YAH!" It is a war cry uttered only by SEAL 
trainees. Nobody seems to know what it means, but it is a long-maintained 
tradition nevertheless. The air rang with the yells of hopeful trainees wearing 
green uniforms, dry for the first and only time during Hell Week. 
</P>
<P>
The instructors, however, seemed further irritated. 
</P>
<P>
"On my shift, I will not repeat myself! Do everything 120% and right the first 
time -- we won't have any problem!" one shouted. "It pays to be a winner!" 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Tom Campbell, the SEAL training officer, explained: "If you don't 
win, you are going to be miserable. And if you lose in combat, you are dead." 
</P>
<P>
The men quickly learned that every training exercise was a race in which the 
winning crew was rewarded, usually by being able to rest. The losing teams 
repeated the exercises again and again. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing their cumbersome boats atop their heads, the eight groups ran and 
stumbled to the ocean, where they paddled one mile to the rock jetty near the 
Hotel del Coronado. The ocean waves hurled the boats into the rocks as each 
crew jockeyed to beat the others ashore. Concerned about disturbing hotel 
guests, instructors ordered the trainees to keep quiet in the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, a small cluster of civilians gathered at the jetty to watch the wet 
men grapple with the boulders and boats. "They're nuts," one bystander 
remarked. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of races in the deep sand, Class 172 was ordered into the water 
to paddle a mile back to the base. They hauled out the boats and ran back to 
the main square in the unlit compound. 
</P>
<P>
The second the men reached the square, explosions rocked the compound, setting 
off alarms in the cars parked outside. The noise was deafening, the flares 
blinding. Men wearing earplugs crept out of the shadows, firing machine guns 
loaded with blanks. Thick smoke spewed from machines made it almost impossible 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
This was "breakout," another longtime SEAL tradition. Instructors shouted 
orders to the young men, who had to do a series of push-ups, stomach-crunchers 
and other exercises amid the smoke and noise as they were hosed down with 
water. For one hour, the chaos was complete. At the end, no man had a dry item 
of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 p.m., the men were ordered to crawl on their bellies. They writhed 
forward in the sand, following an instructor who was blowing a whistle. For the 
next 90 minutes, they alternated between crawling and lining up, arm-in-arm, to 
immerse themselves in water. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are wet, sand sticks to your clothes, it goes through the 
buttonholes. It rubs your elbows and knees raw," said Brad Long, a 19-year-old 
from Peoria, Ill. "It's like dragging yourself over sandpaper." 
</P>
<P>
They switched off between lying in the ocean and kneeling so the waves hit them 
at waist level. The trainees call it "surf torture." 
</P>
<P>
Instructors carefully timed it so the young men were immersed in the water for 
no more than 16 minutes at a stretch. Then they were taken out for two minutes 
before being ordered back in again. That time they stayed for 14 minutes and 
left for three before being returned. The wet uniforms clung to the men as they 
shivered and sang songs. 
</P>
<P>
"You never get used to the cold -- all this does is show it's not going to 
break you," said one 30-year-old instructor from Nebraska. "But just about 
everything I went through in Hell Week was about 10 times worse in missions." 
</P>
<P>
Class 172 continued through the night. At 5 a.m. Monday, they ran. The pace of 
exercises was relentless. At 7 a.m., each crew hoisted its boat overhead and 
marched to mess hall. Even this early in the week, the men had come to loathe 
the boats, which tended to pull the hair off their scalps. Asked later to 
sketch a picture of his boat, one man drew a hammer pounding down on a nail. 
The hammer was labeled "boat." The nail: "student." The hand holding the 
hammer: "instructor." 
</P>
<P>
"The boat bounces on your head. You are completely disoriented, it hits you so 
hard," said Whitted, the leading petty officer of the class. "The boat just 
beats the hell out of you all the way. I hated that boat. Your arms hurt so bad 
that they burn. By the end of the week, you are bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
After a one-hour breakfast, the men were ordered to do push-ups, an exercise so 
common that instructors don't bother scheduling it. Then the men crawled on 
their bellies during whistle drills in the paved parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"In the chow hall, you sit down and have food. Your body starts to slow down. 
You go back outside and it's a shock to your body," said Lt. Anthony McKinney 
of Newport, R.I., the senior officer in the class. "It just felt the worst. You 
are carrying the boats to and from meals. You are going at a fast pace." 
</P>
<P>
Except for four one-hour meals a day, Class 172 was constantly on the move. The 
first two days were packed with strenuous workouts. When they weren't toting 
boats, they were hoisting 250-pound logs over their heads, tossing the logs, 
doing sit-ups with the logs, running races with the logs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the boat crews, the Smurfs were taking a beating. Ordered to race down 
the beach with their logs, they were the only crew to pick up the log with half 
the members pointed in one direction and the other half pointed in the opposite 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday lunch, Class 172 was exhausted. Covered with sand and still wet, 
members lined up for their meal. Beginning with this meal, staying awake was a 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
"You blink your eyes once and they won't open again," said Will Tumulty, 21, of 
Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of using the bathroom during the 10-minute head break, some men changed 
their socks. 
</P>
<P>
"You get your dogs screwed up and Hell Week is over," Whitted said. 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, the men hoisted their boats over their heads and marched to the 
obstacle course. There, they competed as teams -- leaping from one stump to 
another, scrambling up walls, climbing up ropes and walking across logs the 
instructors were rocking. Whitted tumbled as one instructor shoved the log on 
which he was balanced. 
</P>
<P>
At the fifth obstacle, called "Dirty Name," three telephone poles were elevated 
in the air like huge steps. Machinist Mate Jose Fernandez was hoisted up to the 
top log by his team. He suddenly lost his balance and fell 10 feet to the 
ground. Face down in the dirt, he didn't move. The ambulance truck that 
shadowed each of Class 172's exercises drove up. Fernandez began to cry and his 
legs twitched in the dirt. As he hobbled into the ambulance, his boat crew 
yelled, "Hoo Yah, Fernandez!" 
</P>
<P>
The group left the obstacle course for more log races before dinner. As they 
held the logs overhead, the men's faces were red and dripped sweat. Some men 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot take this," one trainee muttered. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to decide if you want to be here or not!" an instructor barked. 
</P>
<P>
For Rich Cleveland, the day's events were familiar. Because this was his third 
try, the men called him "Grand Poobah." He knew he wanted to be here. But he 
didn't know if he could handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am more stupid than anything -- just too stupid to know when to 
quit," said Cleveland, an airman apprentice who made it through Hell Week on 
this try. 
</P>
<P>
Spirits were flagging when Class 172 scored an important victory. As they held 
their logs well above their heads, an instructor yelled at them to race down 
the beach. "He didn't say we had to take our logs," one man hissed. One by one, 
the boat crews dropped their logs and ran empty-handed. The instructors laughed 
at their own goof. 
</P>
<P>
Monday bled into Tuesday. The men had not slept yet. They ran, crawled, 
paddled, dug a huge pit and sat in the surf. They spent the next 24 hours 
outside on the beach. Boxed meals were brought to them on the Strand, potato 
and macaroni salad ladled directly into the box atop the packaged food. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner Tuesday night, each boat crew had to perform for its meal. One group 
imitated Roseanne Barr singing, another pretended to be helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"What's 43 plus 56?" one instructor asked a group. When the fatigued men 
hesitated, he ordered them to do push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
The men, their faces drawn and covered with sand, sat in a circle in a huge pit 
known as Camp Surf. They ate silently, too exhausted to speak. They had not 
slept for 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
One instructor pulled out a brown paper bag and announced: "I've got a real 
sandwich -- turkey, avocado, cheese and croissant. And potato chips." 
</P>
<P>
Although his meal was clearly better than theirs, the members of Class 172 were 
too tired to care. No one responded. Their eyes were glazed. They ate, 
shivering and wet, as the sun went down. One instructor offered a piece of 
chicken to a trainee. He repeated his offer three times before the student 
realized someone was talking to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you are feeling very sleepy," another instructor said, his voice 
soothing, then abruptly abrasive. "But the next person I catch with their eyes 
shut, they will be awakened by the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
The sea, however, was inevitable. After dinner, the men formed a line and 
walked into the surf. They lay on their backs, arm-in-arm, with only their 
heads out of the water. Pelicans swooped into the waves as the men shouted, 
"Hoo Yah!" For the next hour, Class 172 plunged in and out of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The men began walking the bow-legged Hell Week walk. Though they wore special 
underpants that resemble bicycle shorts, the sand had worked its way under the 
fabric, rubbing areas of skin raw. The chafing is worsened by the constant 
dowsings in salt water. Armpits, as well, become severely chafed, and the men 
try to hold their arms away from their sides. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, Class 172 was ordered back to the sand pit, where a fire 
had been lit. They jammed their wet, clothed bodies up against one another for 
warmth. An instructor ordered them to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sleep period -- don't screw with it," he said. "This is not a game. 
This is a sleep period and that doesn't happen very often during Hell Week." 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, most men were snoring. Three, however, tried to stay awake -- 
watching their instructors with mistrust. Twenty-five minutes later, the 
instructors screamed and blew whistles. Class 172 marched back into the water. 
</P>
<P>
"During Hell Week, even sleep is painful -- they get just enough to want more," 
explained one instructor. "In Hell Week, it's a matter of understanding your 
capabilities and limitations. Each man will know there is a point when he 
wanted to quit. You cry, you puke. . . . you have nothing to hide. After Hell 
Week, you don't feel invincible -- you know there are times you wanted out. You 
have no false impression about how great you are." 
</P>
<P>
At 8:50 p.m., Class 172 alternated between lying in the surf and crawling in 
the sand. One man -- Brad Long -- broke away from his group. After speaking 
with two instructors who tried to dissuade him, he stumbled up to the leading 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I quit," said Long, whose stepfather had been a SEAL for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke alone with the officer. Unable to talk him into joining the group, the 
officer told him to drink water and sit by the fire in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost all motivation. I didn't expect to be in the water so much, being so 
cold and wet. I kept thinking about a nice warm shower and going to sleep. I 
regret doing it -- I know I could have made it through," Long said later. "The 
worst thing is trying to figure out what to tell my family. God, I am 
depressed." 
</P>
<P>
Those who suffer medical ailments are allowed to try Hell Week again. But for 
men like Long, there is no second chance. 
</P>
<P>
The members of Class 172 crawled on their bellies in the sand. Only Long's boat

EFFORT TO BAN LIBRARY BOOKS IS INCREASING; 
</P>
<P>
CENSORSHIP: THE COUNTY SYSTEM HAS REJECTED SEVEN OF 10 REQUESTS TO REMOVE 
SPECIFIC VOLUMES THIS YEAR. THE REMAINDER ARE AWAITING DECISIONS.

<P>
Ventura County libraries are facing a rising number of requests to ban books, 
including efforts to purge an Elvis Presley biography and a Christmas book 
featuring a drawing of Santa Claus on a toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, the county system's 15 branches have fielded 10 requests 
to remove books from its 675,000-volume collection, up from a single request 
the previous year and six requests from 1984 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The book-banning efforts, while directed mostly at children's books in 
community libraries, have reached into the schools. Simi Valley educators this 
week will consider pulling a library book because a parent took offense at its 
"pictures of scary wolves and people with masks," a district official said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Jacobs, an associate superintendent for the Simi Valley Unified School 
District, declined to reveal the title of the book under reconsideration, 
saying the matter is being aptly handled by a special committee. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda Walker wants the county library system to pull "Remember The Alamo," a 
1958 children's history book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Penn 
Warren. Walker, 36, of Ventura, said the book contains slurs against Latinos 
and American Indians that children should not read, even if the passages 
reflect the ignorance of earlier times. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a book burner. On the whole, I say if you don't like it, don't read 
it," Walker said. "But it ticked me off when I found my son reading a book that 
said Indians were lazy and stupid." 
</P>
<P>
The efforts to remove books from circulation have alarmed county library 
officials, who have received an unprecedented number of "requests for 
reconsideration of library materials." 
</P>
<P>
Review committees have rejected seven of the 10 requests this year, with 
Walker's appeal and two others awaiting decisions. The volumes retained on the 
shelves include a book on werewolves, an illustrated children's book on slugs 
and a novel for teen-agers based on the life of a female Indian chief who took 
several wives. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the complaints are coming from older Baby Boom parents who are much 
more involved in their children's upbringing," said Sunny Church, manager of 
the county library's children services division. "The problem is that they're 
trying to force their values on others." 
</P>
<P>
Dixie Adeniran, director of the Ventura County Library Services Agency, would 
not release names of those who have sought to take books out of circulation, 
contending that they have a right to confidentiality that supersedes open 
government laws. 
</P>
<P>
Suzi Skutley, manager of Mr. Nichols bookstore in Santa Paula, said parents 
should screen what their children read and not overreact by denying others 
access to books they find objectionable, often without reading the entire text. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times we shortchange our children and don't give them credit for the 
intelligence we've given them," said Skutley, whose store held readings 
Saturday of passages from once-banned books to close Banned Book Week. "These 
complaints are almost funny, until you realize there is serious intent in what 
these people are doing." 
</P>
<P>
The increasing attempts to sanitize Ventura County's public book collection 
come at a time when national watchdog groups are reporting a sharp rise in 
censorship, including attacks on the works of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe 
and the explicit songs of the rap group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
People for the American Way, based in Washington, documented 244 attacks 
nationwide on educational materials and library books during the 1989-90 school 
year, with California accounting for nearly a third of the incidents. Three 
fundamentalist Christian groups spearheaded most of the challenges, the group 
said in an annual report released last month. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Krug, director of the American Library Assn.'s Office for Intellectual 
Freedom, said only 15% of all censorship incidents ever come to public 
attention, the remainder being settled quietly by librarians and school 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"So much censorship in the United States goes undocumented, because someone 
objects to some aspect of a book and it silently disappears from a shelf," said 
Ed Elrod, co-owner of Ventura Bookstore and an anti-censorship activist. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanview School District Supt. Robert Allen said last week that he removed 
"Catcher in the Rye" from the Oceanview Junior High School library in Oxnard. 
Allen said he agreed with a protesting parent that the novel was too mature for 
junior high students. 
</P>
<P>
"It was taken off the free reading shelf," Allen said. "It's not in the library 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the removal of the J.D. Salinger novel, one of the most often 
challenged books since its 1951 publication, didn't amount to book banning, but 
rather reflected a judgment on its appropriateness for sixth- through 
eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't support forcing material on kids that parents don't approve of," Allen 
said. "The child will be caught between two fires." 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers have become cautious in selecting classroom reading lists, 
sensing that certain titles will be vetoed by administrators, Elrod said. 
</P>
<P>
Popular young-adult novels such as "Less Than Zero" and "Bright Lights, Big 
City," in which the protagonists develop severe cocaine habits before paying 
for their vices, would be rejected by many administrators despite their moral 
endings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So instead, kids are still reading 'Silas Marner' after how many years?" Elrod 
said. "A book may be 50 years out-of-date, they won't even read the Cliff 
Notes, when they could be reading something contemporary that will challenge 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Books questioned across the country in the last year have included perennial 
targets such as the works of James Baldwin, Judy Blume, Allen Ginsberg, John 
Knowles, Shel Silverstein, Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut Jr. and Alice Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Many recent targets simply lacked happy endings. Junior high novels were banned 
or challenged in Washington and Oregon for being "devoid of hope and positive 
role models," for "the presentation of divorce as a fact of life and derogatory 
remarks about friends" and because "the character gets away with bad behavior." 
</P>
<P>
In Goose Lake, Iowa, a book called "Revolting Rhymes" faced expulsion from the 
high school library because parents complained that "the boy who is turned into 
a mouse will have to stay a mouse the rest of his life." The library director 
for the Santa Paula Elementary School District moved the same book from an 
elementary to a junior high library a few years ago after a parent complained. 
</P>
<P>
"I just handled it quietly, and frankly, a lot of librarians do that," Patricia 
Alderson said, adding that the book was originally purchased for fifth-graders. 
"Sometimes I just put the book aside and put it back after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura author Ray Maloney said he was startled when he recently learned that 
his novel for young adults, "The Impact Zone," was challenged by a library 
patron in Multnomah County, Ore. The book, which includes profanity and sexual 
references, is about a 15-year-old surfer who leaves Ventura to search for his 
father in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a belief these days that people should be in lock-step, 
marching in the same direction at the same speed," said Maloney, who works as a 
technical writer for an area defense contractor. "That's what gets a society in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
A 37-year-old woman, who declined to reveal her name, said she asked the 
Camarillo Library last week to pull "Please Don't Kiss Me Now" by Merrill J. 
Gerber from juvenile book racks. She said a librarian recommended the book, 
which contains four-letter words and sexual references, for her 13-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"When you read things, they're retained in your brain. If they stick it in the 
adult section, no one will bother to check it out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the county system, the Oxnard Public Library has not received a formal 
request to pull a book since 1984, Director Gail Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Librarians said informal complaints about a book's content outnumber requests 
to pull books from circulation by at least 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Brad S. Miller, a reference librarian at the Thousand Oaks Library, said he and 
his colleagues take great pains to explain to people why a book should be 
retained even if they find it distasteful. He said the only recent censorship 
attempt at the city-run library centered on the film "The Last Temptation of 
Christ" and a patron's assertion that it should be pulled from the library's 
video section. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of earnestness in what the people feel," Miller said. "There 
has to be long and careful explanations as to why the material is here." 
</P>
<P>
Simply voicing their dissatisfaction is a catharsis for most people, Warren 
said. "A lot of people just need to get it off their chest. They usually go 
away realizing there are others in the world with different tastes." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a library responsibility to have a variety of points of view available on 
controversial matters so people can come in and make up their own minds on a 
subject," Adeniran of the Ventura County Library Services Agency said. "The 
taste and interest of one particular party ought not to deprive other people of 
their right to read something of interest to them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHALLENGED BOOKS 
</P>
<P>
Listed below are six of the 10 books challenged in the county library system 
within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Elvis" by Albert Goldman, a biography that includes details of Presley's drug 
and sex life. The protester sought its removal from the adult section because 
"so many young adults look up to Elvis, his use of drugs and sexual perversion 
may make young people emulate this behavior." Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
"Slugs" by David Greenberg and Victoria Chess. The picture book of human-sized 
slugs suggests gnarly things for children to do with them, including "tie them 
to a bottle rocket," and "use them in banana splits." The slugs stuff their 
tormentor in a garbage can. The protester asked, "Can you imagine what a 
5-year-old boy could fry, blend, microwave, and dissect?" and said the theme of 
the book was "Slugs are not good for anything." Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Christmas" by Raymond Briggs. A picture book in which Santa is 
ill-tempered about having to make his annual rounds. A children's literary 
magazine praised the book for depicting a Santa who "is still hard-working and 
faithful," but who "can also be grumpy and impatient -- in short, thoroughly 
human." The protester objected to a drawing of Santa on a toilet and "the 
negative overview of Santa's view about Christmas." Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
"Meet The Werewolf," by Georgess McHargue. A book detailing the werewolf legend 
that includes a recipe and incantations on how to become one. A literary 
magazine noted that the book "comes right out and says that 'human beings 
cannot really change themselves into wolves.' " The objector wanted the book 
banned after discovering his son and a friend trying out the concoction and 
spell. Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
"Woman Chief" by Rose Sobel. A historical novel for teen-agers based on the 
life of a Crow woman who rose to lead her tribe and took several wives, as was 
the custom for Crow chieftains. A reviewer for "School Library Journal" found 
"the personal relationships of this unorthodox woman . . . are only hinted at." 
The protester said the book illustrated that "a woman has an opportunity to 
rise to the pinnacle of her society" but objected to "an implicit theme that 
lesbianism is all right." Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
"Games End" by Milton Dank. A children's novel whose main characters are 
involved in the French Resistance during World War II. The protester objected 
to profanity and "insinuations to adultery-prostitution situations" on one page 
that might lead children to think "that this type of behavior is modeled by 
responsible adults." Committee decision is pending.

PROPOSITIONS M AND D 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unfortunately, San Diego may never get a chance to adopt the concurrency 
measures referred to by John Koenig ("A Lesson Worth Heeding In San Diego," 
Sept. 9) if a phony growth-management proposition facing the voters this 
November passes. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition M and its county equivalent, Proposition D, are thinly disguised 
attempts by the building industry to prevent the City Council and Board of 
Supervisors from establishing concurrency. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key services these measures exempt from being provided concurrent 
with need are schools, police, jails, courts, libraries, recreation centers, 
parks, water and solid-waste disposal. This is particularly threatening because 
both propositions require a two-thirds council or supervisorial majority to 
mend their inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
These propositions make a mockery of local government's efforts to insure a 
sensible growth plan for San Diego. The final indignity is that many of the 
developers who are M and D's key sponsors are not even based in San Diego.

WRONG SIDE OF STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a lovely July afternoon, en route to a Gaslamp Quarter restaurant, I was 
panhandled seven times in six blocks. Just as I reached the corner of 5th 
Avenue and E Street, I was accosted by a drunk lying in the middle of the 
sidewalk who, when I ignored his demands, rolled his bottle toward me in an 
attempt to trip me. I quickly glanced up 5th Avenue and noting that there was 
no traffic, I crossed the street against the light. 
</P>
<P>
I confess. I am guilty of jaywalking. 
</P>
<P>
Heading south on 5th Avenue, I heard someone saying, several times, "Excuse me, 
miss." Not even considering stopping, I hurried toward my destination until I 
felt a hand on my shoulder. With more than a little relief, I turned to face 
two San Diego police officers. Thinking they had seen the incident and had come 
to help, I became incensed when I realized that they had stopped me for 
jaywalking. 
</P>
<P>
I was not pleased and I was not polite. I told them of my plight and all they 
could say was that they had not seen the incident, but had seen me cross 
against the light. 
</P>
<P>
I also plead guilty to being angry and verbal with the two officers. I pointed 
out my difficulty in walking the six blocks from my rented condo and asked if 
they didn't have anything better to do. 
</P>
<P>
I questioned the need for two young, strong and armed officers to stop one 
128-pound middle-aged woman for what I felt was a justifiable incident of 
jaywalking. I expressed relief that I wasn't carrying a screwdriver, as I might 
have risked being shot. 
</P>
<P>
I do not regret one second of my diatribe. I was and am very angry at a policy 
that penalizes citizens, visitors and businesses for a trivial infraction, 
while public drunkenness, vagrancy and drug peddling are allowed to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
I am not without compassion for the homeless; it is a dreadful problem and 
certainly not unique to San Diego. But I have yet to be panhandled by someone 
sober. I have also yet to be protected from them by any officer of the San 
Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The young officer who cited me suggested that if I didn't like the way things 
were run in San Diego, perhaps I might be happier elsewhere. He has a point.

COUNCIL MUST OFFER A GROWTH PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T LET DEVELOPERS, WHO HAVE A PROPOSAL ON THE BALLOT, SET CITY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the San Diego City Council is set to develop a comprehensive 
growth-management package designed to preserve the character that attracts so 
many to this city. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed since 1988, when four city and county growth-cap measures 
were defeated at the polls. When the council takes up the latest restrictions 
Monday, it will be considering regulations for a city facing an economic 
slowdown, not the crest of a development boom. 
</P>
<P>
Dragged into a shotgun wedding with growth controls after housing starts peaked 
at 19,180 in 1986, the council this year has the luxury of a construction bust. 
Only 6,235 building permits were issued in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean that San Diego can do without growth management. The cyclical 
nature of the construction industry guarantees that the city will relive its 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Looming over this year's debate is the growth-management plan put on the Nov. 6 
ballot by developers. The council must act, if only to keep the builders from 
setting city growth policy. 
</P>
<P>
The newest growth plan has merit. It calls for the establishment of standards 
governing the construction of roads, parks, fire stations and other critical 
community needs. New growth would be phased according to the capacity of the 
system to absorb it and still maintain those standards. 
</P>
<P>
That is wise policy. But in some places, the standards are unreasonable. 
Downtown streets, for example, will always be overcrowded. Standards should be 
generally strict, but tailored to reality. 
</P>
<P>
Widening and building roads is not the only way to keep pace with growth -- 
though traffic standards are important. We would like to see more emphasis on 
development of public transit, and more than an obligatory nod toward reducing 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
The city also would establish an exhaustive list of facilities it needs and set 
about building them according to a 20-year plan. In the newer parts of the 
city, developer fees would pay for the projects. 
</P>
<P>
But we are baffled by the absence of a plan to fund the hundreds of millions of 
dollars worth of facilities missing in the urbanized part of the city, where 
new growth cannot be required to pay for most of the need. Why bother to draw 
up a list, and tie development to it, if there is no money for the projects? 
</P>
<P>
The concept of an environmental tier is a sound one. By definitively outlining 
where and how open space will be preserved, the city can target areas where 
development will be off-limits, instead of fighting the battle parcel by 
parcel. Of course, it will take money, or ingenuity, to acquire that land. 
</P>
<P>
Citywide impact fees -- the controversial assessments that the council intends 
to impose to build facilities used by people throughout San Diego -- are an 
idea whose time has arrived. Without the fees, certain roads and parks, and a 
new central library, may never be built. 
</P>
<P>
But because of our uncertain economic future, the city would be wise to chart a 
slow course on impact fees. When the construction boom returns, the fees can be 
ratcheted up. 
</P>
<P>
The planned road projects, some of which appear anachronistic, should be 
reviewed. It would be counterproductive to charge new businesses for projects 
that will never be built. 
</P>
<P>
With the pressure to build subsided, now is the time to develop intelligent 
growth-management policy. If the council can take advantage of this 
opportunity, San Diego may stave off some of the urban ills that have made some 
cities so unlivable.

TOLL WOULD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wholeheartedly support the idea of a toll road in San Diego County ("San 
Diego Toll Road Plan Among 4 OKd by State," Sept. 15). 
</P>
<P>
As usual, opposition comes mainly from the politicians, who stand to lose votes 
from not being able to "give" their constituents another "free"way. 
</P>
<P>
They claim that motorists, given a choice between paying to use a toll road or 
traveling "free" on surface streets, would choose to clog up the surface 
streets. They are wrong in this assumption, as free-market economics continues 
to prove (i.e., the Coronado Bridge versus the Silver Strand route to North 
Island). 
</P>
<P>
I would much rather pay the toll than lose valuable time and gasoline stuck in 
slow traffic. Surely my time, as well as that of other motorists, is worth more 
than a couple of bucks for a toll. 
</P>
<P>
They are also concerned about the $2,800 fee that new homebuyers have paid for 
roads. What they seem to forget is that the fee (actually a tax), was mandated 
by government for building roads in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Toll roads can and do work when left to the free market and private industry to 
administer. The record of government-run roadways (higher taxes, poorer 
conditions) speaks for itself.

PETITIONERS SAY REVITALIZE LENNOX, BUT SPARE HOMES; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: THE COUNTY WOULD DEMOLISH 882 HOMES TO TURN INGLEWOOD AVENUE 
CORRIDOR INTO A VIABLE COMMERCIAL ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Lennox residents, angered by a county plan that would raze 882 housing units as 
part of the redevelopment of Inglewood Avenue, have signed petitions opposing 
the proposal and intend to air their protests at a community meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The county plan calls for a two-block wide corridor on either side of the 
avenue to be designated as a redevelopment area for Lennox, which is a 
1.1-square-mile unincorporated community east of Los Angeles International 
Airport. The largely residential corridor would be converted to commercial use 
under the county plan, which has yet to be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment designation would give the county the power to acquire 
properties in the corridor and force residents to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Lewis, senior manager for the county's Community Development Commission, 
said that redevelopment officials "would make every effort to replace as many 
units as we took out." But exactly how much replacement housing and where it 
would be located has not been determined because of the preliminary nature of 
the plan, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
A community meeting on the redevelopment plan and its effect on housing units 
will be held at 7 p.m. Monday in the Jefferson Elementary School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment plan must ultimately win approval from both the county's 
Regional Planning Commission and the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The residential areas that would be threatened by the plan are the portions of 
Burl and Dalerose avenues bordered by Century Boulevard on the north and 112th 
Street to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say previous drafts made no mention of including these portions of Burl 
and Dalerose avenues, to the west and east of Inglewood Avenue, as a 
redevelopment area. Residents along the west side of Dalerose, whose well-kept 
homes would be among those affected by redevelopment, spearheaded the petition 
drive to thwart the plan. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the precise strategy the county should adopt in its bid to 
revitalize Lennox's stretch of Inglewood Avenue, a deteriorated street zoned 
for commercial purposes. It is frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
County planning officials say the best way to clean up the avenue is to 
designate it and the streets next to it as a redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
Including the adjacent streets in the redevelopment area would make commercial 
development more feasible, because it would allow for both larger and more 
diverse commercial projects to open, said Sorin Alexanian, a county regional 
planner. 
</P>
<P>
The current commercial zoning includes only Inglewood Avenue and provides no 
incentive for developers, Alexanian said. "To be able to design a commercial 
project, you need lot depth," Alexanian said. "The way it is now, the lots are 
shallow and are not conducive to commercial development. If you take a drive 
along there, you'll see no commercial development has taken place." 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment proposal "is an option that obviously needs to be explored," 
said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hector Carrio, a Lennox school board member who has lived on Dalerose 
Avenue for 27 years, said the county would exact "a high and unfair price" from 
residents to clean up Inglewood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Carrio said the signatures of more than 70 residents who opposed the 
redevelopment plan have been gathered and mailed to county officials. Carrio 
said he and many of those who signed the petitions plan to attend Monday's 
community meeting to express their opposition to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents along Dalerose, Carrio said, are senior citizens, some of whom 
have finished paying off their homes. Though the county would compensate 
affected homeowners, such residents might not be able to afford a similar size 
home elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrio added that most Dalerose residents were generally in favor of the 
county's overall revitalization plan for the area and only objected to the 
suggestion affecting existing housing. 
</P>
<P>
James Keen, president of the Lennox Coordinating Council, said the 
redevelopment issue has left him "betwixt and between." 
</P>
<P>
Like many Lennox residents, he wants to see Inglewood Avenue cleaned up, Keen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Dalerose Avenue "is a beautiful little street," Keen said. 
"I'd hate to see it go -- I've got friends who live there. . . . But if we are 
going to make progress and clean up the area, something has to be done."

REFLECTIONS: 'ALL OF US ARE CAPABLE OF ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CREATIVITY AND 
HUMOR' 
</P>

Jacquie Lowell was headed for the medical profession until she abruptly changed 
tracks to a career in humor and creativity. The 43-year-old Clairemont resident 
is the proprietor of Creativity Games, where she helps people rediscover their 
humorous vein. Lowell also directs Zero Gravity, a comedy troupe, and is a 
consultant for the Gifted and Talented Education program in San Diego city 
schools. Lowell spoke with Times staff writer Terry Rather in her home and was 
photographed by Barbara Martin Pinhero. 
</P>
<P>
I was pre-med at Oberlin College and I passed up a lot of opportunities to 
laugh, play and be silly in order to get those A's. I fell off that train in 
senior year. I wanted a break before going on to medical school. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, I was going to Long Island to visit some relatives and my last 
piece of dormitory mail was a notice about jobs at a creative arts school near 
where I was going to visit. So I stopped by and ended up working there for four 
years. It was there that I learned most of the principles I still use in 
teaching today, that all of us are capable of enormous amounts of creativity 
and humor. What stands in the way of the expression of those in adults is fear 
of being laughed at, making a fool of yourself. 
</P>
<P>
To get the creativity and humor flowing is a two-step process: Remove the fear 
by creating a safe environment that is warm, that is friendly, that is playful 
where people can let down those safeguards against looking foolish and take off 
their mental shoes; and two, a series of exercises that will spark the 
creativity and humor flowing. You get people comfortable, relaxed and playful 
and you give them some really intriguing things to do and bam, out comes so 
much humor and creativity that it's awe-inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
First thing I want to do is get them comfortable so I'll start with an 
icebreaker like "people bingo." People come in the door and I give them an 
8-by-10 piece of paper marked up like a bingo card. Instead of letters and 
numbers in each square, there are words. Things like, find someone with the 
same size thumb as yourself. Or, find someone who loves to hike. Or find a 
vegetarian. People are instantly so busy running around tapping total strangers 
on the shoulders they forget to be nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon we realize with icebreakers like that that we're just all folks 
together and there's nothing to be afraid of. We then play a whole variety of 
different games. Some are verbal, some involve movement and mime, some involve 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
Someone once asked me if I had all money in the world, would I still do this? I 
would probably take a vacation and travel around the world, and yes, I'd come 
back to San Diego and do this again. I love it. I can't imagine anything else 
I'd rather be doing. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's always amusing to be in a situation where one has to practice 
what one preaches. I was driving up to Anaheim for a 4:30 p.m. appointment at 
the "Laughter and Play" conference and I got stuck in Friday afternoon Los 
Angeles traffic. I decided to creatively find a new way to get to the hotel by 
getting off the totally bumper-to-bumper freeway and going on side roads. There 
was major construction going on every one of the side roads I tried. It was 
getting later and later and I was getting more and more frustrated. I could see 
the hotel I needed to go to. It was 15 minutes away. Then my car started to 
overheat and by now I was starting to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
Finally I saw the freeway I was looking for, only according to my map I was 
supposed to go north on it and the freeway signs said east and west. I got on 
the wrong one and it's bumper to bumper again. At this point there's no way I'm 
going to make the appointment. I pulled over to the shoulder of the freeway and 
I burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a little part of my brain said Jacquie, you do what for a living? I 
teach humor and creativity! Now isn't crying a little silly? At that point I 
burst into laughter and relaxed.

REDONDO SEEKS TO BLOCK EDISON'S USE OF AMMONIA; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: THE CITY SAYS AIR QUALITY REGULATORS FAILED TO REVIEW THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BEFORE GRANTING A PERMIT FOR A POWER STATION SYSTEM THAT 
IS MEANT TO REDUCE SMOG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Redondo Beach, opening a new front in its battle with Southern 
California Edison Co., has asked air quality regulators to withdraw a permit 
they issued for the construction of two 10,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks 
at the utility's Redondo Beach power station. 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials say the ammonia, a potentially toxic substance, would be used 
in a pollution control system the utility needs to meet regional air quality 
standards. They complain city officials are unwilling to work with them to make 
the project acceptable to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed in the action they have taken," said Sebastian Nola, 
Edison's South Bay district manager. 
</P>
<P>
But the city says the permit, issued by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District on Sept. 7, is illegal because AQMD did not do an environmental impact 
review. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach also says it was never notified about Edison's permit 
application, and is skeptical of the utility's call for cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Coleman, a Los Angeles attorney representing Redondo Beach, said: "It's 
easy to be magnanimous when you have the permit in your hand. The city is doing 
what it has to do to make sure its interests are protected." 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials decline to discuss why they did not notify the city or do an 
impact study before issuing the construction permit. A hearing on the city's 
request for cancellation of the permit is set for Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials say their agency has long anticipated that utilities would have 
to use ammonia-based pollution control systems to meet air quality standards 
for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"Ammonia is used already by ice cream factories and in food refrigeration 
plants," said AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly. "There is no question that the 
compound is not good to breathe in the event of a spill, but history has shown 
it has not caused major (safety) problems." 
</P>
<P>
The permit issue is one of three bones of contention between Redondo Beach and 
Edison. On Sept. 11, the City Council voted to prosecute Edison for excessive 
plant noise. 
</P>
<P>
And last Thursday, the council voted to oppose Edison's proposed merger with 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. Officials fear local noise and air pollution 
could increase under the merger, which would result in increased power output 
by Edison stations in communities including Redondo Beach and El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Edison says the ammonia-based control system would be used on one of the 
Redondo Beach plant's four operating boilers to remove nitrogen oxide from flue 
gases. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen oxide is a main ingredient in summertime smog, and the AQMD is 
requiring utilities to reduce their emissions of it by 79% by the end of 1999. 
According to Nola, the system is one of several the utility plans to use to 
meet the AQMD standard. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet these requirements we will have to embark upon a $680 million 
capital investment program," Nola said, "and the (ammonia-based) system will be 
an integral part." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, the attorney representing Redondo Beach, says the city should have 
been notified that Edison was seeking a permit and asked to comment on the 
application. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent written complaint to AQMD, he said that under state law, the agency 
should have performed a detailed environmental review of the project's impact. 
</P>
<P>
Among the questions that should be addressed are how the ammonia would be 
transported to the Edison plant and how area residents would be affected by a 
spill, the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
Anhydrous ammonia can be fatal if breathed in high concentrations. According to 
Paul Papanek, a toxics expert with the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services, a leak of the chemical can form a dangerous low-floating cloud. 
</P>
<P>
"It actually burns the respiratory tract," Papanek said Friday. "It's every bit 
as worrisome as chlorine gas. . . . It's nasty." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that, because there are densely populated areas close to the 
Redondo Beach power station, the project should have been subject to special 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern is safety," Redondo Beach Mayor Brad Parton said Friday. "We 
have residents within 500 feet of that plant."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: THERE WILL BE MORALE IN THE PERSIAN GULF, THANKS TO SOUTH 
BAY PATRIOTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the general said Wednesday to the U.S. Marines in the Persian Gulf, "There 
will be morale." 
</P>
<P>
And if not, it won't be for lack of trying from the folks back home in the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
From videos and letters for U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia to button sales and 
yellow ribbons for the hostages in Iraq and Kuwait, local patriots have 
launched a host of programs aimed at boosting the spirits of Americans in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people need a lot of support," said Mike Leonzo of Redondo Beach, an 
elder in the Oceanside Christian Fellowship, which has mailed 75 letters to 
U.S. troops on the front lines. "We have a friend there now in the 82nd 
Airborne, and this is the second Christmas he won't be home -- he was (deployed 
with troops) in Panama last year." 
</P>
<P>
Leonzo's church is not scribbling alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Sand Debs, a girls club affiliated with the philanthropic Sandpipers 
organization, has also launched a letter-writing campaign to service people in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
And in Torrance, a group of students at North High School is offering 
higher-tech greetings: Anyone with relatives or friends stationed in the Middle 
East is invited to come to the school Nov. 3 and tape a free 10-minute 
videogram. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Smith, student activities director at the school, said the idea was 
dreamed up by teacher Gary Parton and the 13 students in his video production 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran across the idea out of a newscast and thought we could provide the 
service here," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested should call the class at 533-4426 during school hours and 
make a reservation for Nov. 3, when the taping will be done, Smith said. 
Participants will have a choice of three backgrounds -- one with a Christmas 
tree, another with a huge package and a third with an outdoor scene -- and will 
be allowed 10 minutes of recording time. 
</P>
<P>
The taping will be done by student technicians on videotapes paid for by Toyota 
Motor Sales USA in Torrance, the school's partner in the Adopt A School 
program, Smith said. Participants will get the finished tape that day along 
with mailing instructions. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Smith said, only about a half-dozen inquiries have come in, but the 
class hasn't really advertised the program. It plans to distribute flyers in 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, lest the hostages be forgotten, a group of employees at TRW's Space 
&amp; Defense Sector in Redondo Beach have tied a big, fat yellow ribbon on a 
tree near the company cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
According to the company, electronics technician Jerry Trager came up with the 
idea and suggested it to TRW's Veterans Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a simple gesture not only to acknowledge our military troops, but also 
the American civilians who are being held there," Trager said. 
</P>
<P>
The ribbon has been up since last Friday as "a kind of quiet reminder and a 
positive ray of hope for employees who have relatives or friends involved in 
the crisis," said Bob Neale of the veterans group. 
</P>
<P>
And elsewhere in Redondo Beach, housewife Terri Clune has yet another project 
in the hopper. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged and frustrated by developments in the Persian Gulf, she has contacted 
Coming Home, an Illinois-based nonprofit group set up for the families of the 
hostages, and is lining up volunteers and pledges for a plan to sell buttons to 
benefit the stricken families of "guests" in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching the news one day, and they showed a bunch of people in a bar 
wearing yellow ribbons," Clune said. "It seemed like they were just using it as 
an excuse to party." 
</P>
<P>
Resolving to do something "more personal," Clune and her husband at first 
donned homemade buttons demanding the return of the hostages because "We're 
Saddam Disgusted!" Then, on the Oprah Winfrey Show, she heard about Coming 
Home, a Champaign, Ill., group recently founded by a former hostage in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Belt, spokeswoman for Coming Home, said Clune is the first Californian to 
volunteer to help the organization, which maintains a communications network 
for the families of people detained in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In the short time since it was launched, Belt said, Coming Home has collected 
about $2,000 through donations and sales of buttons that say: "Coming Home. 
Help Bring Americans Home From Iraq and Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to passing along messages and news culled from interviews with 
those who have escaped or been released, the group offers solace and counseling 
to hostages' families, sets up support groups and helps finance trips home for 
former detainees who are stranded in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Clune said she is still processing the paperwork necessary to launch an arm of 
Coming Home in Redondo Beach, but would be glad to hear from anyone willing to 
help her. Buttons are offered in exchange for a donation. Clune can be reached 
at 378-8608. 
</P>
<P>
And for anyone who doubts that morale can be boosted by projects such as these, 
there is this week's letter to the Oceanside Christian Fellowship from Marine 
Cpl. Richard (Rico) Lopez, 22, of Santa Barbara. Lopez, who has been camped in 
Saudi Arabia for the past month, received one of those 75 letters the 
congregation mailed out and responded with a thank-you note. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is great that my fellow Americans and Christian brothers and 
sisters are taking time to let the services know that they have the country's 
support and prayers," Lopez wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"I was deeply touched by the amount of mail that flowed in to 'any service 
member.' I wanted to answer them all." SHAWN HUBLER

Gardena's large Japanese community is celebrating its heritage this weekend 
with displays and demonstrations of Japanese dolls, needlework, bonsai, sumi-ye 
painting and other arts, a variety of foods, as well as martial-arts 
tournaments. The 29th annual Japanese Cultural Show winds up a two-day run 
today from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Nakaoka Memorial Community Center, 1700 W. 
162nd St. 
</P>
<P>
Special attractions today will be a 1 p.m. concert by musicians playing the 
koto and samisen, which are stringed instruments. A tea ceremony will take 
place at 2 p.m. and the art of Japanses calligraphy will be displayed at 3:30 
p.m. Martial-arts tournaments will be held at Rush Memorial Gymnasium, which is 
across the street from the Nakaoka center. Participants will have a go at each 
other in kendo, a form of combat using bamboo swords, and naginata, which 
utilizes long bamboo poles with knives at the end. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the show is the landscaped Oriental garden created by the 
Gardena Valley Gardeners' Assn. It has a pond filled with Japanese carp, known 
as koi. GERALD FARIS

MOTORIST ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN DEATHS OF TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Marcos man has been ordered to stand trial next month for the deaths of a 
man and his daughter who were riding their tandem bicycle July 30 along 
Carlsbad Boulevard when they were struck from behind. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Meiss, 51, who was described by a witness at a preliminary hearing 
on Friday as driving "like he was at the Carlsbad Raceway," was ordered by 
Vista Municipal Judge Harley J. Earwicker to stand trial Oct. 23 in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss is charged with vehicular manslaughter, drunken driving and felony 
hit-and-run in connection with the deaths of Jerry Flaming, 48, and his 
17-year-old daughter, Brandi Flaming. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager died instantly, authorities said, and her father died eight days 
after the collision. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's hearing, witness Curtis Glen Brown testified that he saw Meiss 
strike the cyclists from behind and drive off without stopping.

UCSD PROFESSOR FOUND FATALLY STABBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A popular black professor at UC San Diego was killed late Friday night, stabbed 
several times in his car that was parked near an automated bank teller machine 
in the 4100 block of El Cajon Boulevard, San Diego Police reported. 
</P>
<P>
He was identified as Charles W. Thomas, 64, a psychologist who had taught at 
UCSD since 1971 as a professor of urban studies and planning. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators said passers-by discovered Thomas slumped over his 
steering wheel, asking for help. He was taken to Villa View Community Hospital, 
where he underwent emergency surgery but died. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they knew of no motive and had no identified suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas lived in El Cajon and taught at UCSD's Third College, where colleagues 
referred to him as the "father of black psychology," said university 
spokeswoman Winifred Cox. 
</P>
<P>
"His expertise was in urban culture and Afro-American culture and psychology," 
she said. Among the classes he taught were "Community Dynamics and Ethnicity" 
and "Impact of Public Policy on Human Behavior." He also wrote the book, "Boys 
No More: A Collection of Writings and Essays on the Psychology of Blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' wife, Shirley Thomas, was a professor of Afro-American studies at San 
Diego State University until her death last year.

PACOIMA ACTIVISTS FORM NEW COALITION TO CLOSE RIFT IN BLACK COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new coalition aimed at unifying several factions within Pacoima's black 
community that have been at odds in recent months was formed Saturday, said a 
longtime activist who was elected as the group's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first real step toward a total community effort," said William 
Huling, a counselor and psychology professor at Cal State Northridge. "The 
black community was too fragmented." 
</P>
<P>
Huling's remarks came after a two-hour, closed-door meeting attended by about 
40 black leaders at the Boys and Girls Club in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems have been ironed out," he said. "They're behind us now." 
</P>
<P>
The rift among black leaders surfaced earlier this month when the Ministers' 
Fellowship of the San Fernando Valley threatened to mount a recall drive 
against Los Angeles Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who they claimed reneged on a 
campaign promise to appoint a black field deputy nominated by the group. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bernardi appointed Richard Packard, head of the Black American 
Political Assn., as a field representative, a position that ranks below a 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Some Bernardi supporters who are black sharply criticized the fellowship, which 
represents more than 40 churches in the northeast Valley, for its attack on the 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
One critic said the ministers should stay out of politics and remain in the 
pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
The fellowship had set a Sept. 30 deadline for Bernardi to appoint a black 
deputy, but the Rev. James Lyles, who heads the group, said Saturday that the 
ministers will not try to recall the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
"That battle has been lost," he said. Lyles also said his group would cooperate 
with Packard. 
</P>
<P>
The furor over the threatened recall of Bernardi also led to the fellowship's 
severing ties last week with its political consultant, Fred Taylor, after the 
ministers learned that he was paid $3,000 to do campaign work for Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles, pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Pacoima, said the 
organization, which endorsed Bernardi, was concerned over perceptions that its 
political support "could be bought and sold." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition formed Saturday will work closely with Packard, Huling said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ministers' anger over Bernardi's failure to name a black deputy, 
"the community's not divided about the appointment of Packard," Huling said. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no recall effort against Bernardi because the reasons for the 
recall "have been removed," Huling added. 
</P>
<P>
Both Taylor and Lyles are members of a panel elected to formulate goals for the 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The two men said, however, that they will continue their work with their 
respective organizations -- Lyles with the ministers fellowship and Taylor with 
Focus 90, an organization of homeowners' groups -- as well as with the new 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody sticks to their guns, there's going to be some positive things 
coming out of this," Taylor said of the coalition. "But Focus 90 will 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
Lyles said the fellowship also will maintain its autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Others on the coalition steering committee are Huling, Jose de Sosa, head of 
the state NAACP and a longtime Pacoima resident; Marie Harris, head of the 
Pacoima Property Owners Assn.; the Rev. Alfred Lewis, a member of the ministers 
fellowship; and community activists Tom Montgomery and Ed Kussman. 
</P>
<P>
Huling, a Pacoima resident since 1962, said he and Michael Augustus, another 
longtime community activist, organized Saturday's meeting because they didn't 
like the schisms they saw developing among blacks in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Huling said the meeting was closed to the news media so that black leaders 
could sort out their differences without fear of being quoted by newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
He said the coalition will hold a communitywide meeting to discuss common 
problems at 11 a.m. Oct. 13 at the Boys and Girls Club.

CARSON CITY HALL TO CLOSE ON FRIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson City Hall will be closed Fridays beginning next week as most Carson city 
workers start a four-day work week in an effort by the City Council to meet new 
state air quality regulations for the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations require employers with more than 100 workers at a job site to 
reduce the number of vehicle trips into and out of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all full-time city of Carson employees will be working 10-hour days, but 
shifts will be juggled to continue services at other city facilities, said Al 
Vollbrecht, a city spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall will open at 7 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. Street sweeping will continue 
as usual. Code enforcement officers also will continue weekend duty, Vollbrecht 
said.

FLAMES, SMOKE POUR FROM MOBIL PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flames and heavy black smoke poured from Mobil's Torrance refinery Friday 
morning as a result of a pressure buildup of hydrocarbon gas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials said Friday afternoon that they did not know the cause of the 
pressure buildup that led to the 10:35 a.m. discharge. But a spokeswoman for 
the Air Quality Management District said a valve on a refinery gas vessel 
closed, creating excessive gas pressure. AQMD spokeswoman Claudia Keith said 
the gas line was closed for repair after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Barry Engleberg said the smoke emission occurred when the gas 
buildup was diverted to the refinery's flare system. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported.

SAFE OPTIONS FOR TOXIC HOUSEHOLD WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many recycling centers do not accept hazardous wastes commonly found around the 
home, such as car batteries, paints and oven cleaners. But with a little extra 
effort, those products can be recycled too -- or at least disposed of properly. 
</P>
<P>
Several government agencies hold periodic hazardous waste roundups, where 
household wastes of all types are collected free of charge. The County 
Sanitation Districts has tentatively scheduled its next roundup on Oct. 20 at 
Hollywood Park in Inglewood. For more information, call (213) 908-4286. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles also sponsors roundups, although none is currently 
scheduled. To get on the city's mailing list for announcements about upcoming 
collections, call (213) 237-1634. Contact your local city government for more 
information about roundups in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers of "The Recycler's Handbook: Simple Things You Can Do," which is 
scheduled to be in bookstores Nov. 15, make suggestions about how best to 
handle household wastes that are difficult to recycle. The book can be obtained 
by sending $4.95 plus tax and a $1 shipping fee to The EarthWorks Group, 1400 
Shattuck Ave., 25, Berkeley, CA 94709, or by calling (415) 841-5866. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
BATTERIES. If a service station changes your battery, check to make sure it 
will be recycled. If you replace your own battery, buy the new one from a 
retailer who will recycle the old one. If you cannot find someone to recycle an 
old battery, take it to a hazardous waste facility or to a hazardous waste 
roundup. Do not store old batteries for any length of time in your garage or 
house. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOR OIL. If a service station changes your oil, check to make sure it will be 
recycled. If not, take your car elsewhere. If you change your own oil, store it 
in a screw-cap container that will not leak, such as a plastic milk jug, or use 
a recycling kit available in hardware and automotive stores. Avoid spilling oil 
on the ground, where it will leak into the ground water or wash into storm 
drains -- and eventually go into the ocean. Take old oil to collection sites at 
service stations and garages or to a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
PAINT. If old latex paints still look fresh, mix them together and use them as 
a primer. Some communities have paint exchange programs, where people bring 
reusable paint to trade or give away. Check with your city government. Unusable 
paint should be disposed of at a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
PAINT THINNER. Put used thinner in a jar. After it settles, reuse the clean 
thinner on top, and let the sediment sink to the bottom. When enough sediment 
accumulates, dispose of it at a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS. The EPA estimates that 25% of hazardous wastes come from 
homes. The culprits include lighter fluid, pesticides, furniture polish, nail 
polish, nail polish remover, drain openers, scouring powders, oven and toilet 
bowl cleaners, caulk, mothballs and adhesives. Give unneeded products to 
neighbors or friends who could use them, or properly store and label them for 
future use. Otherwise take them to a hazardous waste facility or roundup.

BIKE PATH SHUTTLE TO NOWHERE AND BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Huntington Beach seems preoccupied with making visitors happy with 
a free shuttle on the bicycle path where on the weekends pedestrians vie with 
bicycles for space. 
</P>
<P>
Walking as a form of exercise seems unrelated to the unnecessary use of 
gasoline to transport one or two persons from one end of the path to the other, 
for no apparent reason, as there are no destinations at either end. 
</P>
<P>
The pier, of course, is closed. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how many of the good citizens of this city realize how much in debt 
the city is to someone's unfortunate idea of service.

POLITICIANS AND SCANDALOUS BEDFELLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Feinstein's 'Star Power' Dimmed by Martyrdom Claim" (Sept. 19): Columnist 
Dana Parsons is quite politically naive if he cannot distinguish between the 
attacks on husbands of women running for high office and that of the scandal 
produced by former state Sen. Bill Campbell and his wife, Margene Taylor 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Let me enlighten him. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Campbell sponsored the women's conference, seeded by taxpayer's money, 
through the Small Business Administration. Mrs. Campbell became a consultant to 
that conference shortly before the conference began and was paid for her 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's aide and secretary also benefited greatly from this conference, and 
of course, because of community property laws, so did Bill. Mrs. Campbell's 
association with the conference was all that came under public scrutiny. I have 
a feeling that Campbell would have been happy if Parsons had not used his case 
as an example. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons also makes it clear that Caesar's wife will always be Caesar's wife, 
candidate or not. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's husband is in private business, and his success is a product of 
free enterprise in our capitalistic system. This was the same with other mates 
of females daring to run for high office. 
</P>
<P>
It must be noted that when no fault can be found with the female candidate, 
they attack her husband. In the case of male candidates, it seems no one cares 
what they have done or what their wives have done; we just look the other way 
and say "Oh, they all do it." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Wilson became a wealthy man after his marriage. Perhaps it would be only 
fair if Gayle Wilson's financial background was carefully checked over.

A BURGEONING COUNTY BUDGET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James L. Doti of Chapman College presented a simplistic and misleading analysis 
of the county's budget in the Aug. 26 commentary "Taxpayers will Eventually 
Balk at Burgeoning County Budget." 
</P>
<P>
The erroneous conclusion of the analysis is that the county budget has been 
mismanaged because expenditures have grown at a rate greater than population 
increases and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
By simply looking at the county expenditures from 1975 to 1990, one might be 
led to such a false conclusion. However, Doti's analysis lacks a much-needed 
recognition of the increasing complexity of the county structure and service 
system that has evolved over the past 15 years. This understanding is needed to 
truly grasp the expenditure picture. 
</P>
<P>
A primary reason the county's budget has grown over the past 15 years is that 
the state and federal governments have required the county to assume the 
financial and sometimes functional responsibilities for a host of services. 
Examples include mandated social services programs and construction and 
financing of new highways in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Orange County has evolved into a metropolitan region. 
Consequently the county is a much more complex society today and it requires a 
different and a more substantial mix of services to meet demands. 
</P>
<P>
Had Doti taken the time to compare the services Orange County is providing and 
funding this fiscal year to those 15 years ago, he would have reached a 
conclusion that the county is now responsible for many more services, with more 
than 50% of the county's General Fund budget financed by federal and state 
government reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
Doti's review needs some comparative analysis to truly understand county 
expenditures. A simple comparison of the per-capita expenditures among 
California counties would have revealed that Orange County has the lowest among 
all of the major metropolitan counties in the state. This speaks to fiscal 
responsibility rather than the fiscal irresponsibility imputed by the 
professor.

RIVER TOLLWAY: IMAGINE THE CONSEQUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The planned tollway in the Santa Ana River is one of the most unfortunate 
proposals to surface in a long time. This toll road would destroy open space in 
that part of the county that is most in need of open space, and put in its 
place a major smog-producing structure. 
</P>
<P>
Further, it will destroy the character of the Santa Ana River trail. At present 
this trail is a quiet place far removed from traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is one of the few places in the county where one can ride a road 
bicycle away from the noise and fumes created by automobiles. It is one of the 
best bicycle trails in the nation and one of the most heavily used recreational 
facilities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
It should be treated like the national treasure that it is and should not be 
turned into an unhealthful and almost unridable path bordering a toll road.

GASSING UP AT ONTARIO AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alaska Airlines' convoluted exercise of departing John Wayne Airport within 
prescribed weight limits, then landing at Ontario Airport to take on fuel, is 
tantamount to exporting garbage to a neighboring state ("Refueling Stop Is 
Airline's Weight-Reduction Secret," Sept. 26). 
</P>
<P>
Not only does this machination transfer the noise of an unnecessary arrival and 
departure to the Ontario area, but it is blatantly wasteful of fuel and 
frivolously exposes the passengers to the slight safety risk of an unproductive 
landing and takeoff at Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Add that slight safety risk to the considerable safety risk of the noise 
abatement departure procedure at John Wayne Airport, coupled with the exposure 
to low-altitude, non-controlled small-aircraft traffic en route to Ontario, and 
the result is a flight, I, as a former airline pilot, would rather not ride on. 
</P>
<P>
I'd much rather go to Ontario by surface transportation in the first instance 
and board the flight there. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne Airport, with its too-short runways, mix of heavy and small aircraft 
traffic and its inane power-reduction, noise abatement procedures, makes the 
airport an accident waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
The new terminal building only contributes to the determination to increase 
operations at this wholly inadequate airport, and thus statistically -- at the 
least -- brings closer the inevitable horrible air disaster at, or in proximity 
to, John Wayne.

STORM DOESN'T DAMPEN REIGN OF REDS' PARADE 
</P>

<P>
CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was like a scene out of a Woody Allen movie. The fans were celebrating. The 
scoreboard was flashing. The TV cameras were ready. 
</P>
<P>
The field, with the exception of a wet tarp, was empty. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was only fitting that the Cincinnati Reds -- the team that since the 
first of June had lost one game more than it had won but watched everyone fall 
apart trying to catch them -- learned that they won the National League West 
Saturday while sitting in the clubhouse during a rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, trailing, 3-1, in the seventh inning to the San Diego Padres, were 
watching the Boston-Toronto game on television when it happened. Someone, no 
one remembers who, was listening to the Reds' broadcast during the rain delay 
when the announcement came across the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Dodgers 3. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, at 6:05 p.m. local time, were champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, no one said it was going to be pretty, and maybe the way we won it was 
pretty ugly," Red pitcher Jose Rijo said. "But we won it. We finally won it. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know, no one's going to remember how we won it 50 years from now 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The news spread quickly through the crowd of 37,133, most of whom were under 
cover near the concession stands. Soon, fans emerged, tipping plastic cups of 
beer at one another. Shrieks of glee could be heard throughout the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there still was no official word on the Riverfront Stadium scoreboard, 
which was showing highlights of the 1970 World Series. The last Dodger score 
shown on the scoreboard was in the sixth, with the Giants leading, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
The delay apparently had been orchestrated by Marge Schott, the Reds' owner. 
She instructed stadium officials before the game to delay updates of the Dodger 
game for several innings. If the Reds were going to win the title, she said, 
they were going to win it in style. 
</P>
<P>
When the rain began at 5:27, and when home-plate umpire Dana DeMuth ordered the 
tarp to be placed on the field, Schott had no choice. You can hold back history 
only so long. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 6:09, the scoreboard let everyone in on the news, showing the 
linescore of the Dodger game. 
</P>
<P>
And just in case there was a soul in this town who didn't understand the 
implications, one minute later, it came across the board: 1990 National League 
Western Division Champions. 
</P>
<P>
The leader, as they say on the PGA Tour, was in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
It hardly mattered to Red fans, who have been awaiting this celebration for 11 
years. They simply stood in the rain, laughing, cheering an empty tarp. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, some Reds appeared on the field, with Rob Dibble and Herm 
Winningham leading the entourage. 
</P>
<P>
The only element missing from the Reds' celebration was Schott. Where was the 
woman who has turned this town upside down? 
</P>
<P>
She finally was discovered outside the press box, kicking the daylights out of 
the elevator door and screaming: "Where's the . . . I want to be on the field 
now!" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the elevator door opened, she got in and moments later, at 6:16, there 
was Scott and her dog, Schottzie, parading around the field. Soon, reliever 
Randy Myers emerged, hugging Schott and patting Schottzie. There was Manager 
Lou Piniella, hugging the owner, but trying to ignore Schottzie. There was 
Schott leading her manager by the hand around the stadium, blowing kisses to 
the crowd. And there was Schottzie, holding up the procession, pausing by the 
Padre dugout to relieve herself. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, yes, it was quite an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Reds, who couldn't wait to wrap their hands around the 
bottles of champagne, they didn't have to go out and finish the game. At 6:42 
the game was called and the celebrating began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
Although the division championship seemed inevitable for the Reds in mid-summer 
after they had led since opening day, the anxiety was a painful burden to carry 
to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough, we struggled for so long," Rijo said. "San Francisco and L.A. 
were on our tail the whole way, it scared me. But it was like a dream for all 
of us, a Cinderella season." 
</P>
<P>
Rijo is one of 14 members of the Reds playoff roster who are castoffs from 
other teams, excluding Piniella. But they jelled into a championship team. 
</P>
<P>
One of those castoffs was Mariano Duncan, traded by the Dodgers along with Tim 
Leary for Kal Daniels and Lenny Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what the difference is this year," Duncan said. "I'll tell you the 
difference. I hit .240 for them, but I know I'm not a .240 hitter all my life. 
But with the Dodgers, they have five or six guys that mix up your head. 
Everyone tell you what to do when you go to the plate, and every one of them is 
telling you something different. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, there's only one guy who helps me with my hitting, Tony Perez. That's 
all I need, one guy. If the Dodgers had Tony Perez, they might be winning too." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rob Dibble: "You look at this team, and you won't find a better clubhouse 
atmosphere than this one. We don't have the best talent, everyone in baseball 
knows the Padres have the most in this division. But we play together. We go 
out together. We lived for this together." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds were laughing and scoffing at any questions about the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, who clinched at least a tie in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
Then someone mentioned the Big Red Machine, the dynasty that ruled all of 
baseball, responsible for the Reds' last division championship in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Then someone mentioned a player from that era, the same one for whom a street 
had been named in front of Riverfront Stadium. The same one who is residing in 
the Marion, Ill., federal penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
Someone brought up the name, Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how anyone else is feeling around here," said infielder Ron 
Oester, who has been with the Reds since being drafted in 1974. "But I've been 
thinking about him. I've been thinking about him a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish Pete could be a part of this. I really wish he could be here, because 
he deserves as much credit as anyone. In his heart, I think Pete Rose knows he 
has something to do with it."

CLEMENS MAKES TITLE PITCH; 
</P>
<P>
AL EAST: RED SOX ACE RETURNS AFTER 25 DAYS TO THROW SIX SHUTOUT INNINGS. 
BRUNANSKY HITS THREE HOME RUNS IN VICTORY OVER BLUE JAYS.

<P>
There proved to be nothing wrong with Roger Clemens' ailing biceps Saturday -- 
nor with the sometimes dormant muscle of Tom Brunansky. 
</P>
<P>
Sidelined 25 days by a tendinitis condition viewed as a threat to his season 
and career, Clemens returned to pitch six shutout innings of a 7-5 victory over 
the Toronto Blue Jays that gave the Boston Red Sox a two-game lead in the 
American League East with four to play. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Fischer, the Boston pitching coach, shook his head later and said: 
</P>
<P>
"If Roger Clemens told me he could walk on water, I'd believe him. There's 
probably nothing he can't do, including driving a tank or flying a plane. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the most incredible thing I've ever seen. He acted like he pitched 
just five days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I'll never be surprised by anything he does after today. I'm just 
surprised he didn't pitch a no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Registering as high as 91 miles per hour on the speed gun, Clemens struck out 
five, walked two and gave up four hits in improving his record to 21-6 and 
lowering his earned-run average to a major league best 1.93. 
</P>
<P>
As the faithful held their breath throughout New England, and a crowd of 35,444 
at Fenway Park watched anxiously, Clemens made 93 pitches in a display of 
heart, complemented by the flexing of Brunansky's muscle. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston right fielder grounded out in the first inning, then hit a solo home 
run off Todd Stottlemyre in the fifth, a three-run homer off Duane Ward in the 
sixth and a solo homer off Rich Luecken in the eighth, becoming the first Red 
Sox player to hit three home runs in a game since Jim Rice on Aug. 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an individualist, but it's every player's dream to produce like this 
in a situation like this," Brunansky said. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with his two-run homer of Friday night, he has driven in seven runs in 
this showdown series, enhancing his potential free agency and putting his team 
on the verge of a sweep. 
</P>
<P>
It is never easy for the Red Sox, of course, and never over in the launching 
pad that is Fenway Park. Thus, what was a 7-0 Boston laugher going into the 
ninth inning, ultimately required the services of relief ace Jeff Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Lamp, who pitched a harmless seventh and eighth for the Red Sox, allowed 
five hits and five runs with two out in the ninth, the final four runs coming 
on a grand slam by Kelly Gruber, who has 31 homers, 117 runs batted in and a 
sore back from carrying the Blue Jays in September. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon came on to get Fred McGriff to pop up for the last out, giving the Red 
Sox a chance to clinch a tie for the division title today. At worst, Boston 
will have a one-game lead heading into a three- game series at Fenway with the 
Chicago White Sox beginning Monday, the division title theirs to win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
They also seem assured of having Clemens available to pitch the playoff opener 
against the Oakland Athletics next Saturday, providing they get that far. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing was that I wanted to feel part of the team again," Clemens said. 
"We had a 6 1/2-game lead (when he last pitched on Sept. 4) and I felt like I 
let the team down. I didn't want to end the season on that kind of downer. 
</P>
<P>
"So much anxiety had built up today that I'm just glad to have it over, glad to 
have pitched well again." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens said he threw often enough on the sidelines to feel secure about his 
decision to try it, though he warmed up for an extra 15 minutes in case of a 
problem, knowing by doing it he would leave a few fastballs in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt fatigue in the third inning and was finished after the sixth," he said. 
"Mentally, I had to take myself past a certain point. In '85, (when he had 
shoulder surgery) I learned there was a difference between pain and being hurt. 
I knew there would be stiffness and different feelings in my shoulder today, 
but I think I can build on this and handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Fischer said he needed to see Clemens throw only two all-out pitches in the 
bullpen to know he was back. Brunansky wasn't as confident. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he shook his arm today I felt a twinge," Brunansky said. "I mean, 
it was an emotional roller coaster watching him warm up, watching him start and 
stop a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never sure he was going to make it, but he's pretty amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky's performance wasn't bad either, particularly since he was benched 
four times in the last week and a half for a lack of productivity and now has 
nine RBIs in the last four games after collecting just 11 in the previous 38. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working on some things and they seemed to have clicked in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky, who hit four home runs in a double-A game while a member of the 
Angels' farm system, drove each of his three homers into the net above the 
left-field wall. Fenway has always been one of his most productive parks, but 
he has only 14 home runs in 125 games since the May 4 trade in which Lee Smith 
went to the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Is he hopeful of re-signing here, or will he leave as a free agent? 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt comfortable and enjoyed hitting here, but I'm not even 
thinking about that right now," he said of his contract situation. "I just want 
to stay hot like this for another three weeks or so." 
</P>
<P>
That would take him through the World Series, a dissolving goal for the Blue 
Jays, who have lost four in a row and six of their past eight games, and are 
2-10 against the Red Sox this year -- 0-6 at Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still not quite over, but it's an uphill battle all the way now," Toronto 
Manager Cito Gaston said of the race. "It would be asking a lot if we lose 
tomorrow. That's a game we have to win." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated again Saturday, Gaston said of Clemens: "He looked pretty good for a 
guy with a bad arm. Guys who are winners reach back for a little more, and 
that's what he did." 
</P>
<P>
Added Boston left fielder Mike Greenwell: "He was great. He was Roger Clemens. 
What more can you say?"

THUNDERING HEARD, USC WINS;

<P>
WEATHER: OHIO STATE PLAYERS ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY GAME ENDED AND ALSO WITH 
THE WAY THEY PLAYED DEFENSE AGAINST USC.

<P>
With Ohio State fans screaming "Forfeit!" and more colorful expressions as they 
left Ohio Stadium Saturday, Ohio State linebacker Steve Tovar and his teammates 
stood on the sideline and let the officials' announcement sink in with the 
water in their red shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Game called on account of weather conditions. Final score: USC 35, Ohio State 
26. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from Ohio State players: raw deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly way to finish," Tovar said later, "very ugly. I guess they were 
looking out for the fans' safety, but that was just an ugly way to finish the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Officials stopped the game with 2:36 remaining and USC owning the ball after an 
unsuccessful onside kick attempt by Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
With a torrential rain beating down and lightning in the vicinity of the 
sold-out stadium, USC Coach Larry Smith and Ohio State's John Cooper had agreed 
with officials before the onside kick that the game would be halted if the 
Buckeyes, who had just put a touchdown and two-point conversion on the board, 
couldn't maintain possession. And so, when the Trojans' Bruce Luizzi came up 
with the ball, the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
Recounting the meeting with officials before the kickoff, Cooper said: "The 
referee said the game should be suspended. I said, 'Let's work out a deal. 
We're going to (attempt an) onside kick. If we get the ball, we keep going. If 
they get it, just go ahead and suspend the game.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith, naturally, had no objection, although he said later that he thought it 
was "kind of strange" that the officials would care what the USC coaches 
thought at that point. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he had no objection to the way the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the referee made a wise decision to suspend the ballgame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His players, however, did not feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really upset," nose guard Greg Smith said. "Chances are, nothing would 
have happened (to allow the Buckeyes to come back). But I play for 60 minutes, 
and what's the harm of playing a few more? Playing 58 minutes, that's not 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"The rain wasn't having much of an effect on anything. For them to suspend the 
game -- well, there was really no reason. I know the game was pretty much over, 
but there was just no reason. You still want to get in there and play. I just 
don't think it was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Said linebacker Jason Simmons: "I've never seen a game end like that in my 
life. I mean, with two minutes left, you never know what can happen -- freak 
plays, dropped balls, interceptions, fumbles." 
</P>
<P>
On a day when the Trojans stuffed the Buckeyes' heralded freshman tailback, 
Robert Smith, and the Ohio State running game, the OSU offense had, in fact, 
found a late spark behind quarterback Greg Frey. 
</P>
<P>
Frey took the decision to halt the game with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
"In a close game like that, no way you want off the field," he said. "Yeah, 
sure, it bothered me. But if somebody gets hit by lightning, what then? You've 
got to do it (call the game)." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if nothing else, the decision added insult to injury for the Buckeyes, 
who had come into the game with hopes of erasing the sting of last year's 42-3 
loss to the Trojans in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They just ran right through our arms," Simmons said of Saturday's loss. 
</P>
<P>
Of Ervins, Tovar said: "The guy showed a lot of speed, showed definite talent. 
But we have to play well against guys like that if we want to be anywhere in 
the rankings." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Buckeyes' emerging stars, Tovar, a sophomore, took the loss 
particularly hard. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a lot to prove this week," he said. "Texas Tech and Boston 
College (teams the Buckeyes had beaten in their two previous games), they're 
good teams. But a game like this tells you if you're really good or not. 
</P>
<P>
"(USC linebacker) Scott Ross, if he wants to call USC Linebacker U. now, he 
can. I have to play in big games. . . . We can't be losing games to Southern 
Cal. I don't care if they're No. 18 or 15 or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"This is two years in a row we tried to prove we're better and didn't do it. We 
wanted to prove as a defense that we could shoot down a legitimate team, a 
(national championship) contender, and we didn't do it. That's what hacks me 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the way the game ended.

TROJANS: ERVINS RUNS FOR 199 YARDS AGAINST OHIO STATE IN GAME CALLED BECAUSE OF 
LIGHTNING WITH 2:36 TO PLAY.

<P>
Ohio State ripped out the artificial turf in Ohio Stadium last spring, 
replacing it with grass at a cost of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, USC and the elements tore up the new field. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, who ranked ninth in the Pacific 10 Conference in rushing offense 
going into the game, ran for a season-high 331 yards in a 35-26 victory over 
Ohio State before that was stopped with 2:36 left because of the weather 
conditions, including torrential rains, thunder and lightning. 
</P>
<P>
Against an Ohio State defense that allowed only 63 yards a game on the ground 
in victories over Texas Tech and Boston College, USC more than doubled its 
rushing output from its first three games. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Ricky Ervins led the way, rushing for a career-high 199 yards and two 
touchdowns before leaving the game in the third quarter with a mild sprain in 
his left ankle, sustained on the second play of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some large holes," said Ervins, who ran for more than 100 yards 
nine times in 12 games last season, but in three games this season had run for 
only 181, averaging 3.0 yards a carry. "The offensive line should be talking to 
you because they played tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
The game was stopped by mutual consent of the coaches after the Trojans 
recovered an onside kick by the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State had pulled to within the final margin with 2:38 left, when 
quarterback Greg Frey passed to flanker Jeff Graham for a two-point conversion 
after tailback Raymont Harris' one-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
If Ohio State had recovered the kick, both coaches said afterward, the game 
would have continued. 
</P>
<P>
And USC, in all probability, would have kept running. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans never trailed. They took a 7-0 lead midway through the first 
quarter when Willie McGinest blocked a punt and Zuri Hector picked up the ball 
and carried it nine yards into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when quarterback Todd Marinovich again posted pedestrian numbers, 
completing 11 of 23 passes for 119 yards and throwing two interceptions, the 
Trojans enjoyed their most productive running game since last September, when 
they rushed for 491 yards in a 66-10 rout of Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
After enduring "perhaps the hardest week of work I've ever seen a team go 
through," as Coach Larry Smith described it, USC returned to basics after last 
week's "disaster," a 31-0 loss to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ohio State Coach John Cooper: "They weren't supposed to have a running 
attack, (but) they just hammered and hammered." 
</P>
<P>
After averaging a conference-worst 2.3 yards a carry in its first three games, 
USC battered Ohio State for 7.3 yards a try. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Lockwood, making his first start at fullback, ran for 75 yards in five 
carries, including a 66-yard third-quarter touchdown run, and Mazio Royster, in 
relief of Ervins, ran for 70 yards in seven carries, including a 50-yard burst. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought it would be a fun game just running it," Marinovich said, "but 
I had fun watching our (offensive linemen) come off the ball and hit people. I 
know our backs were thankful for it." 
</P>
<P>
Was Ohio State caught unaware? 
</P>
<P>
"We were all keyed up to rush the quarterback 30 or 40 times," nose guard Greg 
Smith said, "but it just didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
It was evident from the start that USC could run successfully. Ervins carried 
28 yards on the Trojans' second play. 
</P>
<P>
Still, USC's first possession ended after only three plays, when a pass by 
Marinovich was intercepted at the goal line, and its second went three plays 
and out as Marinovich was sacked on two consecutive plays. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans still scored first, though, after McGinest crashed through the Ohio 
State line and blocked a punt by Jeff Bohlman. 
</P>
<P>
"An excellent effort on the part of McGinest," Smith said. "He's very quick and 
a great athlete. He just made the play." 
</P>
<P>
In its third possession, USC started to move, driving 80 yards to a touchdown 
to increase its lead to 14-0 on a 15-yard run by Ervins, who carried four times 
in the drive for 55 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes closed to within 14-10 midway through the second quarter on a 
46-yard field goal by freshman kicker Tim Williams and a 17-yard touchdown pass 
from Frey to split end Bobby Olive. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, USC again reasserted itself, gaining 58 yards on the ground 
during a 73-yard drive that lasted almost seven minutes and ended with Ervins 
scoring on a one-yard run to make it 21-10 with 1:37 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Ervins had already run for 162 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Ricky took it upon himself (that) this was a personal challenge to 
him," Smith said. "He didn't feel like he was contributing that much and he's a 
determined little guy, so I'm not surprised by what he did. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd be the first to tell you, though, that the day was made possible by guys 
like (Mark) Tucker and (Pat) Harlow and some other offensive linemen who really 
started to put some people on their backs." 
</P>
<P>
Rain began at the start of the second half, but it didn't deter the Trojans, 
who continued to roll. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's 66-yard run increased USC's lead to 28-10. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State's freshman tailback, Robert Smith, a native of Euclid, Ohio, who 
spurned USC to stay closer to home and play with the Buckeyes, then made a 
20-yard run, his longest of a game in which he carried 12 times for 54 yards, 
to spark a 58-yard touchdown drive by the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
Frey, who completed 19 of 36 passes for 262 yards and two touchdowns, passed 29 
yards to Graham for a touchdown with 4:47 left in the quarter, then passed to 
Bernard Edwards for a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
It was 28-18 with almost 20 minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
But, with Ervins watching from the sideline, Royster broke free for a 50-yard 
run on his first carry, leading to a one-yard touchdown run by Marinovich that 
again put USC in command, 35-18, with 14:12 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt we had a terrible running game," Smith said. "It was just a 
matter of getting it untracked. It comes down to blocking and we got control of 
the line of scrimmage." 
</P>
<P>
Paying for it were the Buckeyes and their new field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC is 3-1; Ohio State is 2-1. . . . The crowd of 89,422 represented Ohio 
State's 47th consecutive sellout in Ohio Stadium. . . . Ricky Ervins' 199 
rushing yards were the most by a USC back since 1986, when Ryan Knight ran for 
204 in a 28-3 victory over California. . . . Said Ervins, who ran for only five 
yards in nine carries last week against Washington: "The first (few) games, I 
was trying to pick my holes, thinking about the long runs. But this game, I 
talked to several people, and they said just run the ball hard and make people 
pay for it." . . . In its first three games, USC ran for 248 yards, including 
only 28 last week in a 31-0 loss at Washington. . . . Ohio State ran for only 
79 yards after running for 384 in its first two games.

COMMENTARY: THIS IS NO PLACE FOR A PICNIC

Let's go back to the scene of the crime: the New England Patriots locker room. 
Like all NFL locker rooms, it is where the players undress, shower, dress, 
gossip, play cards, stretch, read the paper, exchange head butts, meet with the 
coach, emit the occasional primal scream and also where they can be interviewed 
by sportswriters and their electronic-media brethren. The place smells of salve 
and sweat and laundry baskets overflowing with jockstraps. You get used to the 
atmosphere, but no one would ever confuse a locker room with, say, the Tulerie 
Gardens. In other words, don't bring a picnic lunch. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, a day not unlike any other, Lisa Olson, who covers the 
Patriots for the Boston Herald, sat down for a locker-room interview with 
cornerback Maurice Hurst. This is how she does her job. She and the other media 
are welcome in this sanctuary, if not by all the players, then certainly by all 
the owners interested in seeing stories on their teams. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity, we need not be reminded, is what sells tickets. And, of course, 
stories are what sell newspapers. It's a neat arrangement that biologists would 
call symbiotic. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular day, during the interview, five of the Patriots emerged 
naked from the shower to approach Olson, taunting her with sexual insinuation 
and suggestions of lewd behavior. Tight end Zeke Mowatt has been named as one 
player who shook his genitals in Olson's face, asking her if she wanted to 
touch them. 
</P>
<P>
Olson has called it mind rape. Team owner Victor Kiam -- you've seen him on the 
Remington commercials -- viewed it differently. Kiam, sitting comfortably on 
the razor's edge of insensitivity, said the Herald was "asking for trouble" by 
sending a woman reporter to the locker room and that players "can wiggle their 
waggles in front of her face as far as I'm concerned." All that he didn't say 
was that she should have relaxed and enjoyed it. Vic, how do you think those 
Lady Remingtons are selling now? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the waggle-wiggling continues. Olson has reported that not exactly 
everyone has been supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had messages left on my machine," she told one newspaper, "telling me 
that I was asking for it, that I'm a whore, that I probably sleep with the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
If the situation weren't so traumatic for Olson, it would almost be funny. What 
is at work here is a terrifying flight of adolescent male fantasy. Many men, 
including athletes, actually believe the women who become sportswriters make 
this career decision based on a desire to see athletes naked. It is my 
experience that you don't need to be a sportswriter to see athletes undressed, 
unless all the women hanging around hotels with ballplayers show up just for 
the free in-room movies. 
</P>
<P>
Locker rooms are not sexy. Despite what you may have seen in "Bull Durham," the 
closest thing I've noticed to sex in a locker room is a proliferation of girlie 
magazines. More male fantasy. I've never known a woman sportswriter who didn't 
believe that entering a locker room was the most distasteful part of her job. 
To tell you the truth, most men sportswriters would say the exact same thing. 
</P>
<P>
As far as I'm concerned, they could close the locker rooms to everyone. I've 
smelled enough dirty socks, just counting the ones I'm wearing. In my perfect 
world, you'd review a ballgame much as a critic reviews a movie or a play. But 
the present system isn't going to change, and women are now full-fledged 
members of that system. 
</P>
<P>
Haven't we gotten past equal access? I think even Judge Souter is for it. Of 
course, some make the argument that men aren't allowed in women tennis players' 
dressing rooms. That's true. Neither are women sportswriters. All anyone can 
ask for is an level playing field and no waggle wiggling. 
</P>
<P>
Please understand, the locker room is not show and tell. I've never seen a 
woman sportswriter try to sneak a peek, and, in fact, most athletes cover 
themselves anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are exceptions. Back in the early '80s, four or five Los 
Angeles Dodgers players had a routine in place for whenever a woman entered the 
clubhouse. These players would parade naked. And they especially loved bending 
over for what is called a moon shot. This is when you could really use a Lady 
Remington. 
</P>
<P>
Do you think women are lining up by the thousands to get up close and personal 
with some baseball player's naked rear end? Or how far does the male fantasy 
extend? Look next for a whipped cream dispenser in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Kiam has certainly done his part to calm the situation. He called Olson "a 
classic bitch." Then, in a TV interview, he said he had seen Olson hanging 
around the shower room, presumably looking for -- at? -- a player. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the story is that she got lost," Kiam said. "Well, I think most people 
know what a shower is." 
</P>
<P>
And most know what the truth is, too. Later, Kiam, confronted with the truth, 
issued a statement that he didn't see Olson near the shower after all, and 
neither did anyone else. Reagan called that misspeaking. 
</P>
<P>
Now, people are talking about boycotting Patriots' games. The Boston chapter of 
the National Organization for Women is calling for a boycott of all Remington 
products, and Kiam will be sorry he bought any part of this business. 
</P>
<P>
Even the slow-moving NFL will be forced to punish the guilty players. Too much 
bad publicity otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Olson? She's back in the locker room. It's her job. Trust me, 
that's all it is.

MORNING BRIEFING: BATTLE FOR COMISKEY MEMENTOS MAY LEAVE BOTH SIDES A WRECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hold the nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
Speedway Wrecking is on a collision course with the Chicago White Sox. At 
stake: collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
Irv Kolko, president of the demolition company, said Friday that his bid of 
$1.2 million to tear down 80-year-old Comiskey Park was based largely on the 
memorabilia value of the wreckage. The White Sox say they want to sell 
memorabilia for charity. 
</P>
<P>
Said Howard Pizer, executive vice president of the White Sox: "Typically, 
salvage means what is left over when someone leaves, and there were specific 
provisions for that. There is specific language identifying seats and other 
memorabilia as our property. The quote (in the contract) says, 'All seats, 
bases, pitching rubbers and other items of memorabilia.' That's pretty 
specific, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Add Comiskey: Michael Roche, an attorney for Speedway Wrecking, said: "The 
contract specifically gives us fixtures, which is even more inclusive than 
bricks and seats. We receive all salvageable materials." 
</P>
<P>
Roche blamed the confusion on the Illinois Sports Authority, which, he said, 
negotiated one contract with the White Sox and another with the wrecking 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Said Roche: "The Sports Authority sold the same thing twice. The question is: 
Who has the priority?" 
</P>
<P>
Speedway Wrecking, the White Sox and the Sports Authority will sit down 
together this week. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On opening day of the 1990 baseball season, which college team had 
the most players on major league rosters? 
</P>
<P>
Stick to basics: National Hockey League President John Ziegler last week 
announced a ban on bright-colored equipment because it is not in the image the 
league wants to portray. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Meehan, general manager of the Buffalo Sabres, said several players used 
neon sticks last season. He argued that the flash of color could be a serious 
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Said Meehan: "Hand-eye coordination is one of the most important things a 
player can have, and that brightness might improve someone's already great 
hand-eye coordination." 
</P>
<P>
Let the games begin: From Reuters: "A cure for impotence based on an herbal 
potion used at China's imperial court has won a gold medal at the Asian Games." 
</P>
<P>
Will he scoot?: Former New York Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto, a broadcaster 
with the team for 34 years, may have called his last Yankee game unless WPIX-TV 
is able to purchase the rights to broadcast 1991 games from the Madison Square 
Garden cable network. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rizzuto: "I have a terrible feeling right now. I'm not an emotional guy, 
but today, thinking about all of this, I had tears in my eyes. Fifty years have 
gone by and I can't believe there's a chance I won't be coming here any more. 
It's kind of frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Deep rough: The eighth hole at Pebble Beach, positioned alongside a perilous 
cliff, is one of the course's most challenging. 
</P>
<P>
Novice golfer Bill Sadler, 45, a lieutenant commander in the British Navy, 
won't argue that. The eighth proved to be his downfall -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler was trying to retrieve a ball when he fell 150 feet. He suffered only a 
broken rib and cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sadler: "I'm extremely lucky. . . . The ball was just over the edge of the 
cliff. I reached down trying to get it and the ground gave way." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Texas, with 14. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Phil Rizzuto, in his final telecast of the WPIX-TV Yankee season, as 
the last batter hit a fly ball to left field: "A high fly, and while it's in 
the air, happy birthday to Daphne Lapizana. She turns 18 today." TED BROCK

MIKE DOWNEY: THE SACRIFICE MIGHT BE A LOST ART IN BASEBALL, BUT IT'S A BIG HIT 
IN NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am thinking about taking a cut in pay, so my company can afford to go out and 
hire somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
I want to make this organization as good as it can possibly be, even if it 
means giving back part of my paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
I want to be like Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
When their basketball teams did not have enough money, under the terms of the 
NBA's salary cap, to go out and purchase a couple of necessary new players, 
Magic and Michael donated portions of their salaries to make the acquisitions 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
That's right -- basketball players, giving rebates. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, I'd hate to think my employers couldn't afford to buy another baseball 
reporter, or a crossword puzzle, or Erma Bombeck or Beetle Bailey just because 
some greedy pig in the sports department was getting too much money. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, a man with a heart of gold as well as a vault full of it, gave 
back something approximating $75,000 for the Lakers to meet the salary needs of 
Terry Teagle of the Golden State Warriors, who will be coming south this season 
to weave baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I know what you are thinking. What's 75 grand to Magic? He'll get that 
back with one Diet Slice commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's the principle of the thing, not to mention the interest. Earvin 
Johnson dug into his own purse and fished out 75K for the sake of the Lakers. 
Teagle is now on the team, and Magic, as usual, gets the assist. 
</P>
<P>
Same thing happened with Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Back on draft day, the 
Bulls were interested in acquiring Dennis Hopson. The salary cap, however, 
stood in their way, partly because Jordan costs more than a tanker of crude 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Since the only way Chicago is ever going to win an NBA championship is for 
Jordan to get some more help, Michael saved the day. He deferred some of his 
income so that Hopson could be paid what he supposedly is worth. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how much Jordan already has in the bank, this was a significant 
gesture on his part. By NBA standards, Michael happens to be underpaid. When 
you take a minute to consider what Hot Rod Williams and Jon Koncak make, it's 
amazing that the Bulls don't have to pay off Michael Jordan in uranium. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, he gave money back. 
</P>
<P>
I respect this. That's why I am willing to do my share, to give till it hurts. 
That's why I am planning to give back $10 from my salary every two weeks for 
the next six months so that, by God, this newspaper can go out and pay what it 
takes to hire somebody else who is worth every bit as much as me. 
</P>
<P>
After all, we are all in this together, and because of people like me, 
wonderful people like me, caring people like me, the world can be a better 
place for all of us, the united way. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sorry. Somehow I slipped into a Georgia Frontiere commercial there. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I wonder what would happen if baseball tried a salary cap. Every time 
somebody in that sport signs a contract for $3.5 million a year, making him the 
highest-paid player in the game, somebody the next day signs for $3.6 million, 
whereupon the first guy says he was cheated and wants his contract renegotiated 
to $3.61 million. 
</P>
<P>
I had a dream the other day where Rickey Henderson, rounding third and headed 
for home, refused to run the final 45 feet unless the Athletics did something 
about his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"OK! OK! You get the damned Ferrari! Now slide! Slide!" 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could use a couple of hitters, but you can't expect Mark Langston to 
spring for them. The White Sox could have used Willie McGee and Harold Baines, 
but it wasn't Carlton Fisk's job to free up the necessary dough. 
</P>
<P>
If Magic Johnson had been playing for the Dodgers, they would have won the 
division. By September, he would have given back enough of his salary that they 
would have gone out and gotten the players they needed most -- like, oh, you 
know, Franklin Stubbs. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers needed a shooter. Magic, being Magic, made one appear. He made sure 
the Lakers were able to get Eagle-Eye Teagle. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls need a center. Michael, being Michael, probably will offer Akeem 
Olajuwon every penny of his salary and play for free, just to win a 
championship. Michael would scrub Chicago Stadium with his tongue to win a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
This NBA salary cap is unconstitutional, if you ask me, but darn it anyway, I 
like it. I wish this newspaper had a salary cap. There's one guy around here 
who makes way too much. 
</P>
<P>
All summer, I've been thinking that this is finally the season the Lakers slip 
to third or fourth place. But I did something I almost never do. I 
underestimated Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Now I estimate that by November, Magic will be playing for about $7.98 a game, 
but the Lakers will have All-Stars at the other four positions. Poor Earvin. 
He'll have holes in his socks, but at least he'll have another ring on his 
finger.

KINCHEN RUNS LSU PAST TEXAS A&amp;M

<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Kinchen turned a short pass into a 79-yard touchdown, then set up a second 
fourth-quarter touchdown with a 60-yard punt return to lead Louisiana State to 
a 17-8 victory over No. 11 Texas A&amp;M on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M scored on a 13-yard pass from Lance Pavlas to Doug Carter with 
5:24 left, and Pavlas hit Shane Garrett for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Suarez had the only score of the first three quarters, a 26-yard field 
goal with four minutes left in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, on a 
third-and-12 situation, Kinchen took a short pass, dodged through the A&amp;M 
linebacking corps, hit the left sideline, spun Kevin Smith around with a fake 
at the LSU 35, cut back across field and outran Smith and two other defenders 
for the right flag. 
</P>
<P>
Kinchen had 10 receptions for 133 yards. 
</P>
<P>
After A&amp;M's next series, Kinchen took the punt at the 26, broke through the 
coverage and raced to the Aggies' 14. Harvey Williams scored from a yard out 
four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M's star running back Darren Lewis was ejected in the second quarter for 
throwing a forearm into the face of a tackler. He had averaged 130 yards a game 
in three previous contests.

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP;

FLORIDA DOMINATES MISSISSIPPI STATE, 34-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shane Matthews passed for 351 yards and three touchdowns and Errict Rhett 
rushed for 143 yards and scored on a seven-yard pass reception to lead Florida 
to a 34-21 victory over Mississippi State in a Southeastern Conference game 
before 72,943 at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The 17th-ranked Gators improved to 4-0 overall and 2-0 in the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's offense produced 567 yards in 94 plays, but had two fumbles returned 
for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of you can tell this team has got a chance for a big year if we 
can eliminate those few bad plays that are happening each week," Florida Coach 
Steve Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have some stupid plays, but I really believe our players played with a 
tremendous amount of effort. . . . When bad things did happen, nobody put their 
head between their legs and nobody started pointing fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews completed 27 of 42 passes and also scored on a one-yard quarterback 
sneak. Rhett, in his second college start, carried the ball 25 times and was 
the main reason Florida was able to build a 2-1 advantage in time of possession 
(39:40 to 20:20). 
</P>
<P>
But as effective as the Gators' offense was, the defense was better. 
Mississippi State was held to 58 yards in the second half and finished with 19 
yards net rushing in 21 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a disappointing game," said Bulldog Coach Rockey Felker, whose team had 
a two-game winning streak stopped in falling to 2-2 and 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week (against Southern Mississippi) we were able to move the ball, but 
Florida's defense caused problems for us," Felker said. "They applied a lot of 
pressure and did a good job of keeping us off balance." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews bounced back from a subpar performance against Furman with touchdown 
passes of seven yards to Rhett, six yards to Kirk Kirkpatrick and 18 yards to 
Ernie Mills. Arden Czyzewski also kicked field goals of 45 and 46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Shane had a little bit of a hip pointer and came in there and had a gutsy 
performance. He played super," Spurrier said. "He missed a few here and there, 
but he hit for a bunch too. I think he is getting better each week." 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 31, Tulane 21 -- Randy Baldwin broke a 41-year-old Mississippi 
single-game rushing record as he ran for 241 yards and two touchdowns in 17 
carries in a nonconference game at Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, who had only 80 yards in the first three games, opened the scoring on 
his first carry by capping the Rebels' first possession with a 26-yard run. The 
senior ended it with a 67-yard scoring run down the left sideline in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (3-1) overcame five turnovers. Tulane is 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia 19, East Carolina 15 -- Chuck Carswell's punt returns of 14 and 55 
yards set up 10 fourth-quarter points at Athens, Ga., as the Bulldogs (3-1) 
posted their third consecutive comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
Carswell, who sat out the 1989 season with a neck injury, set up a 51-yard 
touchdown drive with his 14-yard return and his 55-yard set up a 20-yard field 
goal by John Kasay. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Garrison Hearst capped the 51-yard touchdown drive on a one-yard run 
on the first play of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For East Carolina (2-3), quarterback Jeff Blake had two touchdown pass plays to 
Luke Fisher, covering 69 and 14 yards.

<P>
Craig Erickson threw for 360 yards and three touchdowns as 10th-ranked Miami 
scored the game's final 24 points and beat Iowa, 48-21, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The victory set up a showdown in the Orange Bowl next Saturday between 
defending national champion Miami (2-1) and No. 2 Florida State, which beat 
Virginia Tech, 39-28, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa (2-1) went into the game averaging 54 points, best in the nation, but 
never sustained a running attack that had been potent in the Hawkeyes' first 
two games. Tony Stewart was held to 36 yards in 10 carries and Nick Bell gained 
26 yards in 10 tries. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Carroll scored on pass plays from Erickson of 73 and 16 yards and Darryl 
Spencer scored on a pass play of 35 yards. Erickson completed 17 of 33 passes 
with two interceptions. Carroll had six catches for 146 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes closed the margin to 24-21 early in the third quarter on a 35-yard 
touchdown pass from Matt Rodgers to Sean Smith. The Hurricanes then took 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's Stephen McGuire carried five times for 50 yards and caught a nine-yard 
pass to spark a 64-yard scoring drive. The touchdown came on a six-yard run by 
McGuire to make it 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes had to punt on their next possession, but Doug Buch fumbled the 
kick and Miami's Darren Krein recovered at the Iowa 19. Three plays later, 
Erickson hit Carroll for a 38-21 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The game was Miami's first since the team was ordered by Coach Dennis Erickson 
to tone down celebrating after big plays. The Hurricanes responded to the edict 
by faking high-fives, thrusting their arms skyward for just an instant or 
crossing their arms in mock solemnity.

Terrell Buckley scored on a 53-yard interception return and Errol McCorvey went 
77 yards with a recovered fumble to help Florida State defeat Virginia Tech, 
39-28, Saturday at Tallahassee, Fla., and increase the nation's longest winning 
streak to 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (4-0) didn't get the lead for good until Buckley's touchdown run 
in the final minute of the third quarter made it 32-28. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey's touchdown with 3:59 left in the game completed the scoring, giving 
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden an opportunity to pick up his 200th career 
coaching victory next Saturday against rival Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech (2-3) led 21-3 early and 28-25 with 2:51 left in the third period 
after a four-yard pass from Will Furrer to Vaughn Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
Furrer, who completed 21 of 37 passes for 194 yards, also threw two first-half 
touchdown passes to John Rivers on plays covering four and two yards. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley stopped Tech's final drive with two minutes remaining with his second 
interception of the game. Buckley, who has four interceptions this season, 
returned his second theft 41 yards from his own end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State intercepted four passes by Furrer and one by backup Rodd Wooten. 
</P>
<P>
No. 19 Clemson 26, Duke 7 -- The 19th-ranked Tigers, stung last season by their 
first loss to Duke in nearly a decade, beat the Blue Devils in an Atlantic 
Coast Conference game at Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"Duke spoiled things for us last year," linebacker John Johnson said. "We 
wanted to let them know it wouldn't happen again, starting from the first 
kickoff." 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 1-3 overall and 0-2 in the ACC, trailed Clemson (4-1, 2-1) only 10-0 
after the first half, but pulled away in the third quarter before 81,500 at 
Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Duke rallied from a 14-0 halftime deficit to beat Clemson, 21-17, 
for the first time since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers drove 75 yards in 10 plays -- the key play a 30-yard run by Rudy 
Harris -- on its first possession of the second half to go up 17-0. DeChane 
Cameron, who also threw for two touchdowns, capped the march with a two-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils' only score was a 78-yard kickoff return touchdown by Leroy 
Gallman with 1:28 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 27, No. 25 South Carolina 6 -- Quarterback Shawn Jones ran for the 
Yellow Jackets' first touchdown and his passes set up two other scores at 
Atlanta . 
</P>
<P>
Jones scored on a bootleg from a yard out in the second quarter, Stefen Scotton 
plunged two yards for another score and Jeff Wright scored from 20 yards out 
for Tech (3-0), which also got field goals of 42 and 20 yards from Scott 
Sisson. 
</P>
<P>
Jones completed 11 of 20 passes for 136 yards, with two interceptions, before 
being shaken up and taken out of the game midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina quarterback Bobby Fuller completed 14 of 28 passes for 143 
yards, but he was intercepted three times and sacked five times by a Tech 
defense led by Ken Swilling and Marco Coleman. Coleman sacked Fuller once and 
twice hit him as he released the ball during a fourth-quarter drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Gamecocks fell to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 12, North Carolina 9 -- Damon Hartman kicked a 56-yard 
field goal as time expired and turned the Wolfpack's afternoon of frustration 
into a victory over the Tar Heels in a battle of field goals at Chapel Hill, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman's field goal, a line drive, completely silenced a partisan North 
Carolina crowd which had earlier booed the decision to go for the tie when the 
Tar Heels were at the North Carolina State five. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman broke his own school record of 54 yards, set against North Carolina in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State is now 3-2 and 2-2; North Carolina 3-2 and 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Virginia 63, William &amp; Mary 35 -- Terry Kirby and Nikki Fisher paced 
a 398-yard ground attack and the No. 7 Cavaliers used a third-quarter surge to 
pull away to a victory over the pesky Indians at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, off to a 5-0 start for the first time since 1949, scored 22 points in 
the opening 5:01 of the second half to build a 49-21 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby ran 23 times for 188 yards and four touchdowns, and fellow tailback 
Fisher had 164 yards and two scoring runs in 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's Shawn Moore completed 15 of 26 passes for 291 yards and two 
touchdowns, but he hit only seven of 16 in the first half, frequently 
overthrowing open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
William &amp; Mary (2-2), which beat the Cavaliers in 1987 and played them 
tough in losses the last two seasons, trailed only 27-21 at halftime. The 
Indians are ranked No. 20 in Division I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi 25, Louisville 13 -- Tony Smith returned a punt 46 yards 
for a touchdown to open a 22-point first-quarter blitz that helped the Golden 
Eagles (3-2) win at Hattiesburg, Miss. Louisville is now 3-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest 52, Army 14 -- Anthony Williams rushed for 136 yards and two 
touchdowns and the Demon Deacons (2-2) capitalized on four Cadet turnovers for 
24 points and breezed at Winston-Salem, N.C. Army is now 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State 22, Tulsa 10 -- Freshman Joe Allison kicked three field goals, 
including a 49-yarder into a stiff breeze, and quarterback Keith Benton scored 
on a five-yard run in the fourth quarter to lead the Tigers (2-1-1) at Tulsa, 
Okla.

Alabama ended its longest losing streak in more than three decades Saturday, 
and Coach Gene Stallings got his first victory with a 59-28 Southeastern 
Conference win over Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jones had two one-yard touchdown runs for Alabama, and Gary 
Hollingsworth threw a 25-yard scoring pass to Kevin Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Tarrant Lynch ran 77 yards for a late touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Crimson Tide, which had dropped five games dating back to last season, 
improved to 1-3, 1-2 in the SEC. Vanderbilt (1-2, 1-1) handed Alabama its first 
31 points on mistakes, the same kind of errors that had given Alabama its 
longest string of losses since 1956, when the Tide ended a 15-game skid. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt's Mike Healy had touchdown passes of eight, four, and 28 yards to 
Derrick Gragg, but it was not enough to turn the Tide, which led 52-7 at the 
half.

LONG BEACH MAKES IT TWO IN ROW, 21-20

Todd Studer threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Sean Foster with 1:52 to play and 
Sean Cheevers kicked the extra point to give Cal State Long Beach a 21-20 
victory Saturday over Boise State before 4,106 at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The winning 80-yard drive started after Boise State's Mike Black missed a 
37-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them we had plenty of time, that we could still win," Coach George 
Allen said after the 49ers won their second game in a row to improve to 2-3. 
"We followed the four points I put on the (locker room) board: Be sound, be 
patient, be positive and stick together." 
</P>
<P>
Studer started the drive with pass plays of 29 yards to Foster and 16 to Jeff 
Exum. On fourth and nine on the Boise 34-yard line, Studer hit Keith Fitzgerald 
at the 17. After a penalty, Studer, who had been limping with a sore knee, ran 
12 yards to the 10 to set up the final pass to Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Studer completed 20 of 38 passes for 318 yards and two touchdowns. Exum caught 
seven passes for 188 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach took a 7-0 lead on the third play of the game when Freddie Leslie 
ran 73 yards for a touchdown, but did nothing further for almost three quarters 
against the Division I-AA Broncos (3-2).

MARTINI HAS RIGHT BLEND FOR SAN JOSE;

SPARTANS: QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 361 YARDS TO LEAD TEAM TO ITS SECOND

If San Jose State quarterback Ralph Martini would have impressed Stanford 
admissions officers the way he did the school's football coaches, the Cardinal 
may have been on the other end of a 29-23 loss to the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
"BYU and San Jose State recruited me, and I really wanted to come to Stanford, 
but my SAT scores weren't good enough," said Martini, whose football scores -- 
four touchdown passes and another two-point conversion pass -- were more than 
enough for a San Jose victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Spartan-Stanford game is for heroes, and today, Martini was a hero," said 
San Jose State Coach Terry Shea, whose 3-1-1 team won for the second 
consecutive year at Stanford, where they are 6-4 since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Martini completed 23 of 32 passes for 361 yards, without an interception, to 
outduel Stanford's Jason Palumbis, who was 27 of 39 for 387 yards, with one 
touchdown and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Dennis Green, whose 1-3 team goes to South Bend, Ind., next week 
to face top-ranked Notre Dame, said: "We didn't play as well as we hoped; we 
should have played better." 
</P>
<P>
Martini and Maceo Barbosa had a 72-yard touchdown pass play, San Jose State's 
longest offensive play of the year, on the second play of the second half to go 
ahead 21-3. But Stanford regrouped and scored 13 points in 39 seconds to trail 
21-16 with 12:31 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis teamed with Glyn Milburn on a 69-yard pass play down the sideline for 
the first Stanford touchdown, cutting the lead to 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
After the Spartans fumbled away the kickoff return, Stanford's Tommy Vardell 
scored on a one-yard dive to make it 21-16. A two-point conversion try failed. 
</P>
<P>
Martini then took the Spartans on an eight-play, 70-yard drive late in the 
third quarter. He hit Bryce Burnett on a three-yard scoring pass and then found 
Barbosa in the end zone on the Spartans' first two-point conversion try of the 
season, giving San Jose State a 29-16 lead after three quarters.

'GAME OF YEAR' LEAVES FULLERTON EMPTY IN DEFEAT 
</P>

FRESNO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Saturday night's Big West Conference opener against Fresno State was "the 
game of the year," as Cal State Fullerton coaches and players had said it would 
be, then the Titans won't have much to look forward to in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State routed Fullerton, 38-3, in front of 33,624 in Bulldog Stadium, 
seriously damaging what little hopes the Titans had of winning a conference 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The 24th-ranked Bulldogs (5-0) threw everything they had at the Titans (1-4), 
leaving Fullerton practically defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Barsotti, who is 26-3 as a Fresno State starter, completed 12 
of 24 passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns to lead an offense that amassed 
521 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Aaron Craver, who didn't play football at Compton High School but 
developed into a standout running back at El Camino College, rushed for 121 
yards and two touchdowns, and fullback Lorenzo Neal added 112 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Punter Brad Seagle even ran 47 yards with a fake punt in the first quarter, 
prolonging a drive that ended with a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
And to add injury to insult, Fullerton's best defensive player, linebacker 
Clarence Siler, went down with a knee injury midway through the third quarter 
and had to be carried off the field. Siler suffered a partially torn ligament 
in his right knee, sprained his right ankle and will be out for three to four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton gained 402 total yards but turned the ball over six times, four on 
fumbles and two on interceptions. The Titans had eight turnovers in last week's 
48-17 loss to Akron. 
</P>
<P>
"We got beat by a better team," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "They're a 
top 20 team. We thought we could do some things against their defense and we 
did. We moved the ball in the first half, but it all came down to turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
For Fullerton to have any chance of winning the Big West title outright, 
conference favorites Fresno State and San Jose State must each lose to a Big 
West team before their Nov. 17 meeting. That's not too likely, given the 
strength of the Bulldogs and Spartans and the weakness of the remainder of the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
So now, it appears Fullerton will be playing for what it played for in the 
second half Saturday night -- pride. 
</P>
<P>
So much for Titan pride Saturday night. The Titans failed to score a touchdown 
in a conference game for the first time since 1985, when Nevada Las Vegas beat 
the Fullerton, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
They came close on their final offensive play of the game when reserve 
quarterback Terry Payne hit Danny Pasquil with a 25-yard pass to the Fresno 
State one-yard line. But Pasquil, who never appeared to have possession of the 
ball, dropped it in the end zone. The officials ruled it a fumble, and the 
Bulldogs recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Not that a touchdown at that point would have mattered. This game was virtually 
over at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State took advantage of two Fullerton turnovers and several penalties -- 
the bane of the Titans' existence in two of three previous losses -- to take a 
commanding 24-3 lead after two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had driven from their 28-yard line to the Bulldog 9 on their first 
possession, 43 of those yards coming on a pass from Paul Schulte to J.J. 
Celestine, but Schulte fumbled the snap on a first-and-goal play from the nine, 
and Jeff Thiesen recovered for Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs then drove 88 yards in 11 plays, with Barsotti hitting Marty 
Thompson on a 20-yard, play-action pass for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead. Fifteen 
yards of the drive came on a Fullerton cornerback Lionel Denman's pass 
interference penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Another pass interference call, this one on safety Terry Tramble, who was 
playing his first game in three weeks, hurt the Titans on Fresno State's next 
possession, which ended with Derek Mahoney's 24-yard field goal and a 10-0 
Bulldog lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans scored early in the second quarter on Phil Nevin's 22-yard field 
goal, but Fresno State dominated the remainder of the period, scoring two 
touchdowns. A personal foul penalty on Lorenzo Hailey (late hit) and Darrell 
Bruce's pass-interference penalty accounted for 30 yards of the Bulldogs' 
75-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Barsotti, scrambling to his right, drilled Chris Gawley in the right rear 
corner of the end zone with a 17-yard touchdown pass, and Mahoney added the 
extra point for a 17-3 lead with 5:27 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte went back to pass on the Titans' next possession and fumbled after 
being hit by Judd Foell. Thiesen recovered again for Fresno State on the 
Fullerton 47, and it took the Bulldogs eight plays to reach the end zone, with 
Aaron Craver scoring from one yard out for a 24-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State added two more touchdowns in the third quarter, the first on 
Craver's 11-yard run and the second on Neal's one-yard run. The Bulldogs 
intercepted Schulte twice in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which hasn't defeated Fresno State in their last six meetings, was 
led by Schulte's 201 yards passing on 10 of 24 attempts. Payne completed 8 of 
13 passes for 92 yards in the fourth quarter, and Reggie Yarbrough finished 
with 74 yards rushing.

HORSE RACING LOS ALAMITOS; 
</P>
<P>
PARKER CONTINUES UNLIKELY SUCCESS STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON JACKIMOWICZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 19 days in March of 1984, Jack Parker Jr. lay in a coma, the victim of a 
horrifying multihorse crash at the Meadowlands race track in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors feared that Parker wouldn't survive. He had been kicked in the head by 
one horse and trampled by two others. After coming out of the coma, the doctors 
told him he might be handicapped and probably would not be able to resume his 
career as a harness driver. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly two months he was released from the hospital. And three days 
later, he was back in the sulky, training his horses. On Aug. 2 of that year, 
Parker returned to the races and guided I'm a Wanderer to the winner's circle 
in his first race back. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the severity of his injuries, he never thought about giving up racing. 
</P>
<P>
"That was no problem at all with me," Parker said. "I just thought about 
getting back to what I like to do, driving horses." 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, Parker has won nearly 300 races and earned more than 
$3,000,000 in purses. And now he's asserting himself as one of the top catch 
drivers at the current Los Alamitos meeting. 
</P>
<P>
This is not his first trip to Southern California to race, but the 35-year-old 
Parker is trying to make it his most successful. A little more than halfway 
through the 42-day meet, Parker is fourth in the driver standings, behind Joe 
Anderson, Rick Kuebler and Ross Croghan, despite having only half as many 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
Business was slow for Parker at first, having brought just two of his own 
horses from New Jersey, and finding drives was not easy. But with the victories 
have come increased requests for his services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gotten gradually better since I came out here. It wasn't wham-bam all at 
once," the winner of more than 1,100 races and $11,000,000 in purses said. "At 
first it was two a night, then three and now its four or five." 
</P>
<P>
Parker enjoyed his most successful day of the meet Tuesday when he scored with 
three of his four horses, among them trotter Arnold's World, a 25-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack has become the top catch driver on the track," said current training 
leader Paul Blumenfeld. "I used to think, years ago, that he was wild. Now he's 
more relaxed and he's much better." 
</P>
<P>
Parker is one of several drivers from the East Coast at Los Alamitos this 
season, but so far he has out-performed them all. Donald Dancer, a winner of 
more than 3,000 races, returned to the East after three very unsuccessful weeks 
at the track. 
</P>
<P>
"He just had some bad luck, and I've had some good luck," said the soft-spoken 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
But it has been his soft hands, especially with trotters, and his ability to 
put a horse in a position where it can win a race that have endeared him to 
trainers and fans alike. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 14, Parker watched an accident similar to his own from the driver's 
room when Lepton, one of the nation's top 3-year-old fillies, broke stride 
while leading the race and nearly took down the entire field. But instead of 10 
horses there were only six, and Parker's accident happened at the quarter-pole, 
not in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, that one wasn't as serious, and no one got hurt," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
You could say that harness racing is in Parker's breeding. His grandfather was 
the late Howard Parker, a member of the Harness Hall of Fame and an outstanding 
trainer. His father is a trainer at the Meadowlands, and he also has a brother 
and an uncle who are drivers. 
</P>
<P>
When Parker decided to get into harness racing, it didn't take him long to 
establish himself. He started jogging horses at the Liberty Bell track at the 
tender age of 8, and got his harness driver's license as soon as he turned 18. 
Two weeks later he won in just his third start. 
</P>
<P>
After the current Los Alamitos season, Parker will return to New Jersey where 
his wife, Cathy, has their twin 9-year-old sons, Chet and Jason, in school. He 
will race at Garden State until the Meadowlands reopens after Christmas and 
then plans on returning here in time to open the spring season at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
If he continues driving the way he has, there will probably be a few trainers 
who will personally invite him back if he can't make up his mind.

<P>
Dan McGwire passed for three touchdowns and 322 yards, and San Diego State 
recovered six fumbles and blocked one punt in a 48-18 victory over the Air 
Force Academy Saturday night in a Western Athletic Conference game at San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Amid McGwire's 18 completions in 27 attempts were touchdown pass plays of 71 
and 56 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Pieri recovered two fumbles to lead the Aztecs as they converted Air 
Force mistakes into 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State improved to 2-2 overall and 1-1 in the WAC. The Falcons are 2-3 
and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis Baker, making his first start at quarterback for Air Force, ran for 116 
yards in 29 carries, but completed only two of seven passes for 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, who held a 24-3 halftime lead, opened the third-quarter scoring 
with a three-yard run by Curtis Butts, his second touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire added a 56-yard touchdown pass to Patrick Rowe and a three-yard scoring 
strike to Dennis Arey, giving San Diego State a 45-3 edge late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons' touchdowns came late in the third quarter on a 23-yard run by 
Jason Jones, and on a three-yard run by Chris Gray with 34 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
After recovering an onside kick, Air Force got a 37-yard field goal by Joe Wood 
as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Starting the scoring, McGwire hit on his 71-yard pass play to Arey after Eric 
Duncan recovered a fumble by Baker at the San Diego six, ending the opening 
drive that had gone that 75 yards in 14 plays. 
</P>
<P>
On the Falcons' next possession, halfback DeShawn Durham bobbled a pitch from 
Baker. Andy Coviello took the ball in mid-air and returned the fumble 42 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming 28, Utah 10 -- Wyoming reserve running back Dwight Driver ran for two 
touchdowns as the Cowboys (5-0, 2-0) rallied for a victory at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The Utes held a 10-7 lead at halftime, but Wyoming scored three second-half 
touchdowns, including two in the final 5:26 of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Utah, losing its third consecutive game at home, dropped to 2-3 and 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Driver, a junior starting in place of injured senior Jay Daffer, rushed for 
Wyoming's first and last touchdowns, gaining 91 yards in the process.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
PIRATES WIN, CLINCH AT LEAST A TIE FOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten days ago the Pittsburgh Pirates set a goal: clinch the National League East 
championship before the final three-game series against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
That goal is definitely in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Walk (7-5) pitched a four-hitter and doubled in a run Saturday at St. Louis 
to lead the Pirates to an 8-0 victory over the Cardinals and clinch a tie for 
their first division title since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Today the Pirates, needing one more victory or a Met defeat, will send the 
winningest pitcher in the league, Doug Drabek (21-6), against the last-place 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth victory in a row for the Pirates, who appear to be reaching a 
peak for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited about where we are," said Jay Bell, whose three-run homer was a 
key Friday night, "but at the same time we know what we have to do. We want to 
clinch it before we jump for joy." 
</P>
<P>
In most of the Pirates' 93 victories, one or more of the trio of Andy Van 
Slyke, Bobby Bonilla and Barry Bonds has led the attack. In this one, they were 
a combined one for 15. 
</P>
<P>
But Sid Bream hit his 14th home run, Bell, Mike LaValliere and Jose Lind each 
had two hits and Walk came through with a key sacrifice besides his double. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sept. 20, when Montreal swept a doubleheader against the Mets to give the 
Pirates a 2 1/2-game lead, the Pirates have lost once. They lead by four with 
four to play. 
</P>
<P>
In two previous starts against the Cardinals, Walk was 0-2 with an earned-run 
average of 5.17. 
</P>
<P>
But working on eight days of rest, Walk -- bothered by a back problem much of 
the season -- needed only 103 pitches. He was never in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"After today, I'll be able to go into wintertime with a little bit better 
thoughts when I'm sitting around the fireplace," Walk said. "It's my best 
outing in two years." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals will finish last for the first time since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, New York 2 -- Once again playing without injured sluggers Darryl 
Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds, the Mets reached the edge of elimination at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Although they had Frank Viola going for his 20th victory, the Mets couldn't 
handle Cub pitchers Les Lancaster (9-5) and Paul Assenmacher. Lancaster held 
the Mets hitless until Dave Magadan homered with one out in the fourth. The 
Mets had only six other hits, with the left-handed Assenmacher working four 
shutout innings for his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dascenzo's two-out, two-run single capped the three-run second inning that 
beat Viola (19-12). 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the way we wanted to play these games," Met Manager Bud Harrelson 
said. "We need Darryl and Kevin. There's not a whole lot to say. It's an 
emotional letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry has a sore back and McReynolds has an infected toe. Between them 
they have 61 home runs and 190 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, about all that's left for the Mets is Magadan's drive for the 
batting title. His sixth home run was his only hit in three at-bats. Magadan is 
at .330, while Willie McGee -- now with the Oakland Athletics -- is at .335. 
</P>
<P>
With four games left, Magadan, by going eight for 16, could win the title. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 9, Atlanta 0 -- Glenn Davis doubled twice, drove in three runs, scored 
three and was involved in a bench-clearing incident at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, hit by a pitch in the fifth, was almost hit in the sixth by Dwayne 
Henry. Davis argued with catcher Kelly Mann and both dugouts emptied. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Philadelphia 1 -- Brian Barnes pitched a three-hitter for his first 
major league victory and the Expos ended their eight-game losing streak by 
defeating the Phillies at Montreal. DAN HAFNER

<P>
KINGS' VICTORY HAS SPECIAL MEANING FOR PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a month of a demanding training camp and an exhibition season during 
which the team barnstormed the country, the Kings will at last settle down to 
business. Or more correctly, the business side of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings opened camp with 81 players and went into Saturday night's final 
exhibition with a roster of 33. Those numbers will change upon the completion 
of Monday's NHL waiver draft. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster is not revealing who the team will protect in the draft 
-- each team may protect 18 skaters and two goal tenders -- but certain players 
Saturday night were aware that if they wanted a job with the Kings, they still 
had to impress the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
And the Kings were impressive, beating the New York Islanders, 6-2, before 
11,653 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Webster has adopted the age-old coach's view that competition is healthy for 
any team at any time of season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just now, it's the whole year," Webster said. "That was something we 
went through this year at training camp; we wanted to get depth in the 
organization so we don't have to look at any roster moves at all. Players were 
fighting for their jobs. I think it was encouraging what we saw. The players 
played. One of the most competitive camps we've had." 
</P>
<P>
An area Webster and King GM Rogie Vachon probably will scrutinize is the King 
defense, a perennial concern. A handful of defensemen were hampered by 
injuries, adding to the problem, but as of Saturday night the situation had 
improved. Tom Laidlaw's back injury has improved with the aid of cortisone 
injections and the veteran defenseman has begun skating. Bob Halkidis is 
recovering from off-season shoulder surgery and is expected to be able to 
scrimmage by the middle of October. Perhaps the best news of all for the Kings 
was Steve Duchesne's return to the lineup Saturday night after a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
The bright spot on defense is Rob Blake, a rookie who played a few games for 
the Kings last season after playing at Bowling Green. Webster reserves his 
highest praise for Blake. 
</P>
<P>
"Outstanding. I think we should be talking about him as a candidate for rookie 
of the year," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
A young, mobile defenseman with such talent is the sort of player the Kings 
yearn for. They would also like to see a greater commitment to defense from the 
entire team -- as they have for a decade.

NEWSWIRE: ORMSBY SETS DRAG RECORDS IN QUALIFYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending Winston champion Gary Ormsby recorded the quickest and fastest times 
in drag racing history Saturday at Heartland Park in final qualifications for 
the $1,025,050 NHRA Heartland Nationals at Topeka, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Ormsby set a quarter-mile record of 4.881 seconds and had the fastest speed 
ever, 296.05 m.p.h, in the Top Fuel division. 
</P>
<P>
Ormsby's record run bettered the elapsed-time record held of 4.909 seconds set 
by Darrell Gwynn last March in Baytown, Tex., and beat Ormsby's own top speed 
mark of 294.88 m.p.h. established last October at Ennis, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
In the funny-car category, Ed McCulloch of Hemet wheeled his Oldsmobile to a 
track record of 5.211 seconds at 271.49 m.p.h.

THREE TIED FOR LEAD IN THE SOUTHERN OPEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Hallet finished birdie-eagle Saturday to complete a round of 65 and gain a 
share of the lead with Kenny Knox and David Peoples after the third round of 
the Southern Open. 
</P>
<P>
Knox had a 68 and Peoples, who led by two shots entering the day, had a par 
round of 70 over the tight, hilly, 6,775-yard Green Island Country Club course 
at Columbus, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Both Knox and Peoples birdied the 18th to join Hallet at 199, 11 under par. 
There are 14 players within three shots of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Buckner had a double-eagle 2 on the par-five, 585-yard 18th when he used a 
four-wood to hit 243 yards into the hole on his second shot. He is in a group 
at 202. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Woosnam, angry because of a round that took more than five hours, shot a 
four-under-par 67 and took a three-stroke lead over Mark McNulty after three 
rounds of the Grand Prix of Europe at Chepstow, Wales. 
</P>
<P>
Persistent rain that eventually turned into a downpour slowed play, but 
Woosnam, at 14-under-par 199, said the main culprits were the players. 
</P>
<P>
"We took 4 hours and 15 minutes for the first 15 holes, which I think was 
disgraceful," he said. "I know it was wet, but there are obviously some very 
slow players out there." 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Bob Charles added a 66 to his first-round 65 and leads by 
two shots after two rounds of the senior tournament at Melbourne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Charles is at 13-under-par 131 at the 6,590-yard Suntree Country Club course. 
Dale Douglass shot a 67 and is at 133. Homero Blancas is next at 135.

WINNING WAYS ARE THE SAME FOR RAIDERS, BEARS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: L.A.'S SHELL, CHICAGO'S DITKA WILL STICK WITH WHAT GOT THEM TO 
3-0 -- THE RUNNING GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For one game, the forward pass as we've come to know it may cease to exist. The 
Raiders and Chicago Bears, using scripts from another era, threaten to reduce 
today's game to a public pushing contest in a battle of undefeated teams at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, Raider Coach Art Shell has said in so many words that any team 
that throws the ball 30 times a game should have its head coach examined. 
</P>
<P>
On the other, Bear Coach Mike Ditka has threatened to run the ball 70 times a 
game, if that's what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
Scoffing at today's offensive wizardry and the glitter of run-and-shoot, the 
Raiders and Bears threaten to set the game back 60 years. Why? Because they are 
winning, and this is a league of copy-cat coaches and strategists. 
</P>
<P>
Passes might be pretty, but nothing beats winning. Sometimes, winning is this: 
At one stretch in last week's 19-16 victory over Minnesota, the Bears ran 19 
consecutive running plays. Chicago ran 43 times for 215 yards. Quarterback Jim 
Harbaugh threw 16 passes, completed five for 43 yards and otherwise stayed out 
of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
In the battle for fewest passes thrown, Harbaugh, with 59 through three games, 
ranks second only to Jay Schroeder of the Raiders, who has 54. (New England's 
Steve Grogan has 52, but he didn't play last week.) 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders and Bears have taken the same conservative approach on the road to 
3-0. Both teams are unsteady at quarterback, so they have relied on strong 
running games and dominant defenses. 
</P>
<P>
How dominant? The Raiders have allowed an NFL-low 25 points and one touchdown 
in three games. The Raider defense has scored more touchdowns, two, than it has 
given up. The Bears are right on their heels, having given up 29 points and two 
touchdowns. Shell acknowledges that he and Ditka share the same philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to win," Shell said. "If it means we've got to win , 3-0, I'll 
take that. If it means we've got to win 35-34, I'll take that." 
</P>
<P>
A 3-0 score seems more likely today. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka doesn't know how long he can get away with 16 passes a game, the total 
Harbaugh has attempted in Chicago's last two victories. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a departure from the norm," Ditka said. "I think you have 
to have the ability to throw the ball, and more than some confidence in your 
passing game. But the bottom line in this game is that you've got to do what 
you've got to do. You can't ever fool yourself, or get caught up in looking at 
stats, or wonder, 'Oh, gee, I saw Cincinnati and they do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
After last year's 6-10 finish, the worst in his eight years as the Bears' 
coach, Chicago, Ditka didn't much care how he got it turned around. The Bears 
had a 4-0 start in 1989 but closed the season with six consecutive losses. At 
one point in the schedule, Ditka predicted his team would never win again, and 
it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Either through group therapy or sheer will, Ditka claims to have blocked the 
season from memory. He wouldn't even say he was surprised by his team's fast 
start, for that would be acknowledging last season's slow finish. 
</P>
<P>
"What should I say, that I expected to lose?" Ditka said. "You don't 
understand. You don't live in the past, do you? That's dead. You don't base 
anything on last year. We don't base anything on last week or next week. It's 
silly. Why would you want to talk about last year? It's one thing we don't talk 
about around here. Based on what? Based on '85. You want to talk about that, 
too? We had a good season in '85. So what? Who cares? Who cares what we did 
last year?' 
</P>
<P>
But what about that dramatic turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what you're talking about," Ditka said. "What was last year? Do 
you remember what you got for Christmas? I don't." 
</P>
<P>
A few clues, regardless. The Bear defense, which ranked 25th in 1989, is 
looking more like the unit that dominated the mid-1980s. Ditka is moving 
defensive end Richard Dent along the line of scrimmage this season, and Dent 
has responded with four sacks. Defensive end Trace Armstrong, the No. 1 pick of 
1989, leads the league with five sacks. William Perry has pushed his dinner 
plate aside long enough to play the best football of his six-year career. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing about William people don't understand," Ditka said. "When he's out 
there, you have to account for him." 
</P>
<P>
On offense, Neal Anderson leads the NFL in rushing with 263 yards in 64 
carries. But he couldn't do it without Harbaugh, who hands Anderson the ball. 
Today, it will be more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Neal Anderson has sore ribs, but Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said the running back 
would play. "He's probable," Ditka said. "He'll play, but he's hurt." . . . 
Fullback Brad Muster, a first-round pick in 1988, had a career-high 90 yards in 
14 carries last week against the Minnesota Vikings. . . . Raider Coach Art 
Shell said his team's 20-3 exhibition victory over the Bears means nothing. 
"It's live bullets now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bear defensive tackle William Perry, who had reduced his weight to an estimated 
298 pounds in training camp, is back up in the 320-pound range again. "I can 
live with it," Ditka said. "I'd like him down a little lower. His job is to 
play football and play the best he can. As long as he does that, I'm not going 
to have any gripes about pounds here or there. . . . The Raiders and Bears are 
two of five unbeaten teams in the NFL. . . . Shell and Ditka, both in the Hall 
of Fame as players, never faced each other on the field.

The Hornets scored two touchdowns in the third quarter when defensive back Tim 
Miltersen intercepted Pasadena quarterback Ken Edwards' pass and returned it 24

SEWICKLEY REPEATS AS HOUSEBUSTER FADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sewickley, who had not won since last year's Vosbergh Stakes, scored a 4 
1/2-length victory over Sunshine Jimmy Saturday in the $236,800 race at Belmont 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Sewickley, ridden by Angel Cordero Jr., closed strongly while 1-5 favorite 
Housebuster tired abruptly in the stretch and faded to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Sunshine Jimmy, under Chris Antley, closed in the final strides to wrest second 
place from Glitterman in the field of nine 3-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster shadowed pace-setting Glitterman into the stretch while the leader 
set fast fractions of 21 3/5 for the quarter-mile and 44 for the half, but 
faded as Sewickley rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Flint Schulhofer said he does not plan to run Sewickley in the 
Breeders' Cup Sprint, but might start him in the NYRA Mile at Aqueduct Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the first in eight starts this year for Sewickley, who covered 
seven furlongs on a fast track in 1:21 to earn $142,080. The winner returned 
$14.20, $7.40 and $4.60. Sunshine Jimmy paid $11.20 and $9.40, and Glitterman 
returned $11.80. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster's trainer, Jimmy Croll, said his colt "didn't warm up well. He 
looked like he was a little crampy. He injured himself." 
</P>
<P>
It was found after the race that Housebuster had suffered a cut on his left 
hind leg in the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Wackie won his first stake, the $55,250 Foolish Pleasure for 2-year-olds 
at Calder Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
Saddle Tramp, a 15-1 shot, finished second but was disqualified and placed 
fourth for impeding Franklin Me inside the sixteenth pole. Ballroom Romeo came 
from last to finish third, and was moved up to second. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Heberto Castillo Jr., Jackie Wackie ran a mile and 70 yards in 1:45 
4/5 and paid $3.80, $3.80 and $2.80. Ballroom Romeo paid $10.40 and $5.20. 
Franklin Me returned $3. 
</P>
<P>
Earn Your Stripes, overcoming injuries that limited him to only one race over 
the past two year, raced to a two-length victory in the $150,000 Bay Meadows 
Budweiser Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was worth $84,700 to the 6-year-old horse who suffered from bone 
chips in his ankle after a successful campaign as a 3-year-old that included a 
victory in the $130,000 Pomona Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Patrick Valenzuela, he easily passed Frost Free down the stretch to 
win his eighth race in 23 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
Earn Your Stripes finished six furlongs in 1:08 and paid $5.20, $2.60 and 
$2.40. Frost Free paid $2.40 and $2.20. Just Deeds paid $3.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Capades, champion New York-bred filly in 1988 as a 2-year-old and again in 
1989, has been retired after sustaining a serious injury in a workout at 
Belmont Park. Her trainer, Richie O'Connell, said the 4-year-old granddaughter 
of Damascus suffered a broken left-front cannon bone. 
</P>
<P>
After victories this year in the Grade II New York Handicap at Belmont and in 
Atlantic City's Grade II Matchmaker Stakes, Capades retires with 11 victories, 
nine seconds and two thirds in 27 career starts and earnings of $1,015,006.

<P>
Daniel Niednagel, who had the fastest time for the second consecutive year, won 
the Dana Hills Cross-Country Invitational Saturday for the third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel, a senior at Dana Hills High School, led 116 senior boys from 22 
Division I schools, finishing the three-mile course in 14 minutes 51 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Brendan Sullivan of Dana Hills was second, and Saddleback's Eddie Salinas, who 
ran neck and neck with Niednagel in last year's race until Niednagel pulled 
away at the end, finished fourth. Blake Rothschild of El Toro was third. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to go a little faster," Niednagel said. "He (Salinas) was there 
for only about a mile. Last year, we were totally pushing each other. This 
year, the pace wasn't as fast." 
</P>
<P>
In the Division I junior/senior girls' race, Shelley Taylor of Edison won in 
17:02, 52 seconds ahead of Susan Scott of Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
James Pendergraph of Riverside Norte Vista edged Escondido's Cesar Lopez in the 
Division II senior boys' race, winning in 15:05. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's Heather Killeen (17:42) and University's Tanja Brix (17:54) were the 
only two Division II junior/senior girls to finish in less than 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The top two senior boys in Division III were from San Marino: Peter Nichols 
finished in 15:14 and Carlos DeQuando came in at 15:27. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa's Denisha Bendz (18:14) edged San Marino's Marjorie Hsu (18:16) in 
the Division III junior/senior girls' group.

DACHI'S FOLLY WINS DERBY, SETS RECORD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over an extremely fast track at Fairplex Park Saturday afternoon, Dachi's Folly 
set a track record in beating favored Greydar by a neck to win the $104,300 
Pomona Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Rallying from seventh down the backstretch, Dachi's Folly moved between horses 
on the far turn and caught Greydar in the final strides. Rocket Gibralter was 
another neck behind in third. Due To The King, winner of the Foothill Stakes, 
was rank throughout and faded to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Dachi's Folly covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 2/5 under Alex Solis, breaking 
Epidaurus' record by one fifth of a second. Dachi's Folly paid $18. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised because he finished three lengths behind Greydar the 
last time and really needed the race," Solis said. "He really kicked it in down 
the stretch this time." 
</P>
<P>
Greydar was four wide around the clubhouse turn and three wide into the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th race, Monte Parnes set a track record of 1:41 3/5 for 1 1/16 miles, 
paying $46 to win. Growler Sandue, a $25,000 claimer, equaled the 6 1/2-furlong 
track record of 1:15 1/5 in winning the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fairplex Notes 
</P>
<P>
Veteran thoroughbred trainer Richard Mulhall suffered a heart attack and was 
admitted to Arcadia Methodist Hospital, according to Fairplex Park publicity 
coordinator Don Escalante. Mulhall was in the coronary care unit Saturday 
evening. Hospital spokesmen refused to release his condition. . . . No one had 
six winners in the Pick Six. Today's carryover is $39,412. . . . Annual Date, 
winner of the Pomona Derby last year, tops the field for this afternoon's 
$150,000 Pomona Invitational Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Garcia and Paul Atchison avoided injuries when unseated by their mounts 
in the sixth and eighth races, respectively. Exclusive Emigrant broke down 
entering the backstretch of the sixth race and Pirate's Adventure unseated 
Atchison when caught in tight quarters around the clubhouse turn of the eighth 
race.

MCILVAINE INTERVIEWS FOR PADRES' GM SLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe McIlvaine, New York Mets vice president/baseball operations, said Saturday 
night that he recently interviewed for the Padre general manager opening, but 
refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his Tuckahoe, N.Y., home, McIlvaine said in a telephone interview 
that he was in California a week ago to interview for the job, but declined to 
say whether he'd accept, if offered. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been out there, I've talked with them," McIlvaine said, "but that's all I 
can tell you. I'm sorry, I'm just not going to comment any further." 
</P>
<P>
However, Newsday reported in today's editions that McIlvaine will go to the 
Padres, and the announcement could come as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
Newsday reported that its source said the announcement might be put off until 
the Mets are officially eliminated from contention for the National League East 
title. One victory by the Pittsburgh Pirates or a loss by the Mets would 
accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Werner, Padre chairman, who has been conducting the interviews, declined to 
comment, as he has throughout the search process. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine, 42, is one of six candidates that the Padres are known to have 
interviewed for the position. However, he is the highest ranking of any of the 
candidates interviewed, and is the only one of the group who directly is 
involved in the trading of players. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Padres are keeping mum, McIlvaine would appear to be the leading 
candidate of the group because of his qualifications. He joined the Mets in 
November 1980 as the director of scouting, subsequently became assistant vice 
president/director of player personnel, and in November 1985 was promoted to 
his present position. Previously, he had spent five years in the Detroit Tiger 
organization as a minor-league pitcher, and was a scout with the Orioles, 
Angels and Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest question to the Padre ownership is whether McIlvaine would 
accept an offer. The New York Times, attributing their information to sources 
close to McIlvaine, reported that McIlvaine is willing to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates who have been interviewed for the vacancy, and who still 
are interested, are: Bob Gebhard, vice president/player personnel of the 
Minnesota Twins; Walt Jocketty, director of baseball administration of the 
Oakland Athletics; Dan Duquette, assistant general manager of the Montreal 
Expos; Gordon Ash, assistant general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays; and 
Roger Jongewaard, vice president/scouting and player development of the Seattle 
Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine's name has popped up in the past for general manager vacancies, but 
he discouraged interest, expressing his desire to stay with the Mets and become 
their general manager when Frank Cashen retires. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported that McIlvaine's thinking has changed, primarily 
because Cashen still isn't ready for retirement. Also, McIlvaine reportedly is 
weary of being heavily criticized for his recent trades, such as sending 
outfielder Lenny Dykstra and reliever Roger McDowell to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in exchange for outfielder Juan Samuel.

COUNCIL GADFLY IS SENTENCED, GETS WARNING BY JUDGE; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: DANIEL ROSENBERG IS GIVEN THREE YEARS' PROBATION, ORDERED TO DO 100 
HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR DISRUPTING MEETINGS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Municipal Court judge put gadfly Daniel Rosenberg on three years' probation 
last week and ordered him to do 100 hours of community service for disrupting 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, 61, was convicted last month of interrupting a March 20 meeting of 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Judge John S. Lane warned Rosenberg that he faced going to jail 
if he violated his probation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you misbehave and you come back to me, I want it distinctly understood that 
I'm going to put you in jail," Lane said. "If you behave yourself, you have 
nothing to fear." 
</P>
<P>
Misbehaving, said Susan Melton, the assistant city prosecutor who handled the 
case, means "if he does it again, and just doesn't shut up, and causes more 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
City officials -- who have taken to leaving the dais, rolling their eyes and 
chatting during Rosenberg's many diatribes -- said they are pleased with the 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd take it very seriously if I were him," said Mayor Ernie Kell, who has 
sometimes switched off the microphone during Rosenberg's speeches. "We can't 
have people like Mr. Rosenberg completely disrupting public meetings." 
</P>
<P>
However, local activists feared that the sentence would intimidate others who 
wish to speak out at public meetings. And they questioned spending $3,000 a day 
for the three days it took to try the case -- a decision city prosecutor John 
Vander Lans said was Rosenberg's. Rosenberg refused a pretrial offer that he 
plead guilty in return for 40 hours of community work. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is ridiculous, when there are so many other kinds of pressing 
needs and issues," said Alan Lowenthal, president of Long Beach Area Citizens 
Involved. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenthal said he felt "sorry" for Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
But if Rosenberg is intimidated, he did not show it at Wednesday's sentencing. 
Instead of the formal suit he had worn to his trial, he sported a pair of jeans 
and a worn denim shirt. Embroidered on the shirt were a rainbow, a sun and a 
gull, which he said represented "freedom and love." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg's manner was also dramatically different from the oddly timid way in 
which he comported himself at his trial last month, when his attorney, Jay 
Glaser, argued that Rosenberg was a "man with a mission to help" the poor and 
weak. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Rosenberg was his old scrappy self. He read a defiant seven-page, 
handwritten speech saying, in part: "This is one of my proudest days in my 
life. I'm disliked and perhaps even feared and hated." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg said battling a "corrupt political machine" is what has caused his 
lack of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
And he vowed to keep fighting: "We will not remain silent." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg filed an appeal immediately after the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg recently put a message on his answering machine asking for donations 
to what he called the Long Beach Legal Defense Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Slap back," he says on the machine. "Help disrupt the corrupt. Vote with your 
dollar. We need your help."

BELL GARDENS FEARS IT'S LOST TOUCH; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY EVENTS HAS DROPPED, PROMPTING OFFICIALS 
TO ORDER A STUDY ON HOW TO BETTER SERVE PEOPLE.

<P>
In the five years that he has been a city councilman, Ronald Bird said he has 
received maybe 15 calls from residents who have a problem they want to bring to 
his attention. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, he and his fellow council members have watched 
attendance at once-popular community events -- such as health fairs, earthquake 
preparedness fairs, school plays and cultural festivals -- dwindle until no 
more than a handful of people appear. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders, concerned that City Hall is losing touch with the community, have 
hired a community and governmental affairs firm to undertake a $12,000 study of 
community services and recommend ways to strengthen them. 
</P>
<P>
"When hardly anyone shows up any more, that's a message that something has got 
to change," Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders and residents cannot pinpoint one specific reason for the lack of 
participation and apparent lack of interest in city programs. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason could be that many Bell Gardens residents earn poverty-level 
incomes and are more concerned with getting food on the table than civic 
participation, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Poor communication, caused in part by a language barrier and in part by the 
bureaucracy at City Hall, also plays a role, both city officials and residents 
said. Some residents also blame city leaders for failing to adapt to changes in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two decades, Bell Gardens, like many cities in Southeast Los 
Angeles County, has undergone dramatic change. What was once a quiet suburban 
community populated by Midwesterners who lived on large lots and tended small 
farms is now a teeming city of Latinos, many of whom speak limited English, 
live in crowded conditions and earn about $5,000 a year. According to city 
officials, 30% of the population is transient, most residents do not own their 
own homes and more than half are younger than 18. 
</P>
<P>
"The change has caught everyone off guard," Bird said. "We've just now 
discovered that we must serve different ethnic groups differently." 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has undergone a drastic transformation in the last 20 years, 
Bell Gardens City Manager Claude Booker said many city programs have not 
changed since the city was incorporated 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Booker said, the Bell Gardens High School drama department has 
performed "South Pacific" for years -- Councilman Bird remembers his daughter's 
performance 14 years ago before a packed auditorium -- but at this year's 
performance, the auditorium was nearly empty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for a real step back to look at the city and see how we can do 
better," Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
According to representatives of the Latino community, city officials have a lot 
of work ahead of them. The all-white City Council has been roundly criticized 
-- especially during the last several elections -- for not being receptive to 
the community. There have been complaints that the city does not make an 
attempt to inform Latino residents about issues of concern and has made little 
effort to seek participation of residents in community affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Hernandez, a 13-year resident of Bell Gardens who made an unsuccessful bid 
for a City Council seat in April, said she does not believe that the city is 
sincere in trying to strengthen communication with the community. 
</P>
<P>
"They are just trying to save their jobs," she said. "It's not going to help 
any. What the people here need and want and are screaming for is just to be 
heard. If the city is really concerned about answering our needs, they just 
have to come to us. They don't need to spend thousands of dollars on a 
consultant." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the study, Hernandez and a few Bell Gardens residents said 
that if the city really wanted to strengthen communication with the community, 
it had a perfect opportunity at a recent Planning Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was continued, was to discuss rezoning a residential area 
for industrial use. Hernandez said residents of the targeted area were angry 
because they said they had not been adequately notified that the city was 
considering the change. 
</P>
<P>
City officials placed notices in a local newspaper and sent written notice to 
those who requested it, but Hernandez and others said the city did not make 
enough effort to make sure everyone knew and understood what the zone change 
will mean. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole thing just proved to me that the city doesn't really want to open 
the doors of City Hall to us," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Though city leaders acknowledge that change in the city has been slow, they 
said they have tried to make themselves accessible to residents. Among other 
services, there are bilingual tours of City Hall, more bilingual staff, and a 
monthly publication mailed to all residents with information on City Council 
actions, Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think cities have an obligation to reach out to people and say, 'You're not 
telling us what you think, so we are going to come to you,' " Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas M. Calderon, the president of Calderon, Bacon and Associates, the 
Fullerton-based firm that is preparing the study, said one of its main goals is 
to make City Hall less intimidating to residents. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, he said, the city must learn to operate as most corporations 
operate today. He said that residents have become to cities what a market is to 
a corporation. Both cities and corporations must understand the wants and needs 
of the market in order to improve service, he said. To that end, he has 
interviewed church, school and law enforcement officials, as well as city staff 
and members of the community, including Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about getting back to basics, and re-establishing contact with 
people," he said. "The business of serving people has changed dramatically. 
What we are finding is that communities and corporations really feel they don't 
have a handle on what's happening out there." 
</P>
<P>
Booker said many cities have not taken the time to analyze their services and 
programs to determine which have become obsolete and what is lacking, because 
most cities in the area are focused on economic survival. 
</P>
<P>
He said the first concern of city officials everywhere is to develop a strong 
economic base and make sure basic services, such as law enforcement, are 
well-funded and running smoothly. Bell Gardens now has both, he said. 
Redevelopment is well under way, and the city has a strong reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bird said he and his fellow council members are confident that the 
study will help city officials reach more residents and encourage them to 
become involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not reach everyone, but our goal is just to reach more people than we 
are now," he said.

<P>
L.B. SYMPHONY FINDS ITS TEAM PLAYER IN JOANN FALLETTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, when the Long Beach Symphony's directors failed to renew 
conductor Murry Sidlin's contract, there was talk of football in the Terrace 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the music director as the quarterback," board president George M. 
Murchison said, "and we want to improve the team's record. I want to see a 
better passer in there." 
</P>
<P>
Sidlin was livid. He said comparing music to sports is inappropriate and 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
His successor, JoAnn Falletta, a week ago introduced concertmaster Roger Wilkie 
during a lecture before the season's opener this way: 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like I'm the coach and he's the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Then the diminutive maestro, who is 36, added sweetly, "I don't know how Roger 
feels about being described that way." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's management feels just fine about it. For if the board of 
directors wanted a conductor who is a team player, they seem to have found one 
in Falletta. And if better passing means selling more tickets, well, the 
youthful maestro is a veritable star. 
</P>
<P>
Since Falletta took artistic control of the 90-member group last year, overall 
ticket sales have increased by 54%, said Mary Newkirk, the orchestra's general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
With an increase in the price of admission, she said, revenues are up 76%. And 
for the first time in its 56-year history, Newkirk said, the orchestra has 
begun a season, Falletta's second as conductor, with its classical music series 
sold out before the first concert. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen an enthusiasm that we simply have not known before," Newkirk said. 
"There's no question but that JoAnn has already made a mark on the orchestra; 
she is one of the stars of her generation." 
</P>
<P>
Even the maestro's series of pre-concert lectures, which Sidlin performed in 
the 900-seat Center Theatre, had to be moved to the adjacent Terrace Theatre, 
which seats 3,000, Newkirk said. 
</P>
<P>
"We found we were turning people away," she said. Average attendance is about 
1,500 per lecture. 
</P>
<P>
And the attention paid the conductor by the national media seems to have 
brought a new level of exposure to an orchestra that, just six years ago, was 
struggling back from the brink of financial oblivion. Earlier this month, 
Falletta was on the cover of "Musical America," a major national journal of the 
classical music industry. And focusing on her as she led the orchestra during 
the recent season opener were several CBS cameramen, filming an upcoming 
profile by Charles Kuralt for "CBS Sunday Morning." 
</P>
<P>
Why all the fuss over someone whose main claim to fame is the directorship of a 
regional orchestra that many consider overshadowed by the much-better-known Los 
Angeles Philharmonic? 
</P>
<P>
Part of the answer, Falletta's admirers admit, is that she is young and female, 
both of which are relative anomalies in the close-knit world of conducting. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond that, they say, is her musical style: one marked by verve, tenacity 
and a kind of vivacious energy that most audiences find hard to resist. 
</P>
<P>
"She has young ideas," said Ray Bisso, a member of the orchestra's board of 
directors and chairman of its artistic advisory committee. "Yet she still has a 
good traditional grasp of things. It's a perfect balance." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Perlmutter, a Times critic who reviewed the Sept. 22 concert, described 
Falletta as "a genuine podium master with considerable flair," who extracted 
from the orchestra a "plush, full-bodied, integrated sound" containing, at 
various times, "propulsion and heat" as well as "vigor, breadth, excitement and 
no surfeit of sentimentality." 
</P>
<P>
Many audience members seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"She's terrific," Carole Atkin, a longtime concert-goer, said during the 
intermission. "She's improved the quality of the orchestra tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
Amy Blender said: "She's lent an enthusiasm, a vitality and a vibrance that has 
captivated all of us and given an electric quality to the performances. JoAnn 
is really impassioned with the music; I've waited a long time for her." 
</P>
<P>
Falletta modestly attributes her success at attracting audiences to being in 
the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"We, as a symphony, are part of the renaissance of Long Beach," she said during 
an interview at the downtown Villa Riviera, where she recently bought a 
condominium unit. "It's the right kind of cultural environment; I was very 
fortunate to (come to) an orchestra poised for growth." 
</P>
<P>
She has tried to aid that artistic and financial growth in several ways. She 
has broadened the orchestra's musical repertoire to include the works of such 
little-performed composers as Bela Bartok and Bohuslav Martinu. She has 
expanded the group's traditional youth and kinder-concert programs to reach a 
far greater number of children (and potential future concert-goers) in area 
schools. And she has supported the careers of today's struggling young 
composers by providing a forum in which their works can be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Later this season, for instance, the orchestra will perform the first work in 
its history that it commissioned: a piece by Mark McGurty, a young California 
composer. 
</P>
<P>
Falletta has also become a "team player" in ways that orchestra board members 
say was lacking in the past. As required by her contract, she spends at least 
100 days a year in Long Beach. Besides her downtown apartment, she maintains 
homes in Denver, where she directs the Denver Chamber Orchestra (she also heads 
a group called the Bay Area Women's Philharmonic in San Francisco), and in New 
York, her hometown. 
</P>
<P>
When in Long Beach, she averages five speaking engagements a week on behalf of 
the symphony. And, in general, the youthful conductor has become a highly 
visible member of the community and an effective advocate for the orchestra, 
Newkirk said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's remarkably centered and remarkably strong," Newkirk said. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians, while generally praising her, tend to be somewhat more restrained in 
their assessments. Steve Scharf, a violinist who has been with the symphony for 
10 years, describes Falletta's musical personality as "cool and no-nonsense," 
in contrast with Sidlin's "rush and fire." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see a little more clarity," he said of her conducting style. "I 
don't always read her" intentions. 
</P>
<P>
John Hollenbeck, principal trombonist, said Falletta tends to concentrate on 
the mechanics rather than the emotions of the music -- a focus he said the 
symphony needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we play cleaner now," he said. "We have a much better ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
And Allan Carter, a violinist with the orchestra since 1974, said that, while 
preliminary indications are good, the jury is still out on whether it will be a 
marriage made in heaven. "We're still getting used to her," he said. "I hope 
the orchestra will grow as much under JoAnn as it did under Murry. It's too 
early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
As far as management is concerned, the verdict is a foregone conclusion. 
Already, Newkirk said, the orchestra is negotiating with Falletta's managers 
for a three-year extension of her $70,000-a-year contract, which expires in 
June. "I would imagine she will get a raise," Newkirk said. 
</P>
<P>
Falletta, meanwhile, is brimming with plans for the orchestra's future, many of 
which involve schemes for attracting people to the concert hall who have never 
been there before. 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, her major problem is too much success. "The fact that we're 
sold out has been a problem," Falletta said. "We can't really reach out to new 
people. We're almost stymied." 
</P>
<P>
To help make performances more accessible to new audiences, Newkirk said, 
orchestra staffers have begun contacting season subscribers before each concert 
to request the return of any unused tickets. 
</P>
<P>
They are also, she said, planning to add concerts in future years that will be 
separate from the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Newkirk said, things are running smoothly for the newly 
constituted Long Beach Symphony. Does she fear that the rising media star at 
its helm might some day leave the orchestra behind? 
</P>
<P>
Falletta "is definitely going to be going places," Newkirk said, "but Long 
Beach is going along with her."

DESPITE HEATED BIG MAC ATTACKS, WEST COVINA OKS RESTAURANT

<P>
The City Council has overturned the Planning Commission and approved 
construction of a controversial drive-through McDonald's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
After two marathon sessions of heated debate, the council early Thursday voted 
4 to 1 to approve the restaurant at 3030 E. Garvey Ave., near the San 
Bernardino Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nancy Manners voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, the president of a local homeowners association 
threatened to "get even at election time" with City Council members who 
overturned the commission decision. City Council elections are normally held in 
the spring of even numbered years. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a council that is sensitive to the needs of the people," said Corey 
Warshaw, president of the East Hills Homeowners Assn., which opposed the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Although the property is located in a commercial zone, the McDonald's Corp. 
needed the city's permission to build a drive-through restaurant, said Pat 
Haley, West Covina planning director. The Planning Commission twice voted 
against the project. 
</P>
<P>
During lengthy public sessions Monday and Wednesday, 32 people spoke against 
the project. Twenty-nine people, some of them affiliated with McDonald's, spoke 
in favor. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents complained that the restaurant would increase noise, traffic 
congestion and pollution and would decrease their property values. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned with the increase in crime, or robberies, a fast food restaurant 
would bring," Yvonne Hillmann said. 
</P>
<P>
But William J. Brutocao, an attorney for McDonald's, countered that the 
drive-through would provide the city $25,000 a year in sales tax revenue. The 
restaurant would also provide 100 jobs, according to other McDonald's 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Planning Commission denied McDonald's proposal to build the 
119-seat drive-through eatery. The commission said the project was not 
compatible with the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
But at an appeal hearing in July, the City Council referred the project back to 
the commission for review and revision. On Aug. 15, the commission voted 
against the revised project. 
</P>
<P>
The revised project called for a wall to buffer traffic noise, restrictions on 
hours of operation, removal of some roof lighting and an agreement to provide a 
recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the commission turned down the project, planning director Haley 
recommended that the council approve it last week. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed, approving the revised project on the conditions that 
McDonald's construct a 10-foot-high noise-buffer wall and conduct a traffic 
study. If the study shows that a stoplight or sign is needed, McDonald's would 
pay at least part of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that residents in the San Gabriel Valley have 
attempted to halt construction of a McDonald's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Altadena residents have delayed construction of a McDonald's restaurant at the 
northwest intersection of Altadena Drive and Lake Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents of that project asked the county Board of Supervisors to block 
it, but because the restaurant plans comply with the site's commercial zoning 
and local building plans, the supervisors could only ask for a more detailed 
review under a 10 1/2-month urgency ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance requires McDonald's to obtain a conditional-use permit before 
beginning construction. A public hearing must be held before such a permit is 
granted.

LA MIRADA HOPES THAT SMALL WILL BE BETTER FOR MALL; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: CITY OFFICIALS BREAK GROUND FOR SCALED-DOWN NEIGHBORHOOD 
SHOPPING CENTER TO REPLACE MALL THAT FAILED.

LA MIRADA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, the La Mirada Mall grew from a 50-store, open-air shopping 
center to an enclosed mall, doubling in size, because bigger was better. And 
malls couldn't lose. 
</P>
<P>
But the La Mirada Mall lost. 
</P>
<P>
City officials now are endorsing a step back in size that they say is forward 
in thinking. They are ripping down their regional mall and replacing it with a 
neighborhood shopping center that will house about 40 stores, theaters and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
At a groundbreaking Thursday, city officials and businessmen gathered around a 
10-by-20-foot patch of artificial turf graced by a podium, a loudspeaker, two 
columns of green and white balloons and a silver-bladed shovel. 
</P>
<P>
Around them, mounds of asphalt pushed up from the ground like stalagmites. 
Vacant shells of buildings echoed the hum of bulldozers. And above the din and 
dust, purple and yellow letters still clearly identified this vanishing ghost 
town: La Mirada Mall. 
</P>
<P>
It is the rubble of which retail dreams were once made. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '70s, Canadian developer Mark Tanz invested about $7 million to 
transform a loosely arranged collection of stores into an enclosed mall next to 
a renovated outdoor plaza with fountains and trees. 
</P>
<P>
A city-commissioned market study boasted, "The La Mirada Mall has become an 
attractive, growing center. . . . Many people seem to treat this mall as a 
community center and visit it just to browse or show to visitors." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the work by Tanz, the shopping area had grown steadily since 1958, 
when a market and a handful of other stores first appeared on vacant land at 
the southeast corner of La Mirada Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue. There was 
room to grow and the plaza did, piece by piece, across 72 acres. 
</P>
<P>
And that became part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If a housewife wanted to take her clothes to the cleaners, buy some clothes 
for her kids, have her shoes repaired, shop at the grocery store and mail a 
letter, she had to move her car five different times," Councilman Wayne Rew 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The center generally thrived anyway, until these weaknesses were exposed by 
increasing competition in every direction: to the north, the Whittwood Mall 
(enclosed and expanded in 1979); to the south, Buena Park Mall (built in 1979) 
and Los Cerritos Center (built in 1971); to the east, La Habra Fashion Square 
(1969), and to the west, the Stonewood Center (built in the late 1950s, now 
being enclosed). 
</P>
<P>
That is why Tanz expanded and enclosed what became the La Mirada Mall. He and 
the city would try to win the battle of the big malls by being bigger. 
</P>
<P>
But the enclosed mall, too, had problems. The weaving, circular interior path 
made some stores almost invisible, and customers literally had to walk a 
figure-eight to get to other businesses. Some of the larger stores in the east 
wing were not even directly accessible from inside the mall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was confusing," Councilman Art Leslie said. "You weren't sure which door 
you went in or where you had parked your car. And it was spread out so far. It 
wasn't convenient for people to walk." 
</P>
<P>
Successful regional malls are typically located near freeways or on major 
roads, or both. La Mirada Mall sat at the intersection of two streets with less 
combined traffic than Whittier Boulevard, a major thoroughfare to the north, 
carries by itself. Visibility from freeways also was limited, to say the least. 
A market study pointed out that a potential shopper could see the top of a mall 
pylon from a single overpass of the Artesia Freeway. Other than that, shoppers 
had to know the mall was there and not mind leaving the freeway and driving 
more than a mile to search for it. 
</P>
<P>
Major stores deserted, including J.J. Newberry, Woolco, Ohrbach's and Barker 
Brothers. Attempts to lure a major department store failed. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Madeline Hernandez, 25, was among those who began shopping at the 
Cerritos mall. "More people, more stores, more big department stores," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Frances Smith, another resident: "The shops were always closing and they 
were always opening new ones. I usually just went to the movies when I went to 
the mall." 
</P>
<P>
In a desperate attempt to lure tenants, mall owners negotiated long-term, 
low-cost leases for desirable tenants, such as Toys 'R' Us, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that some businesses had a lease that said their rent went down 
instead of going up," Councilman Rew said. 
</P>
<P>
The efforts failed to attract great numbers of either new customers or tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Tanz sold the mall about 10 years ago, and there followed a succession of 
absentee or inexperienced owners, City Manager Gary Sloan said. They included a 
residential developer, two garment-industry executives and a Long Beach savings 
and loan. Mall owners invested little in the property, he added. 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 city-sponsored study offered solutions: make the entrances stand out 
more, improve the road around the mall, make the doors more identifiable, add 
attractive and consistent architectural features throughout, install larger 
illuminated signs and skylights. 
</P>
<P>
The ideas were tabled pending the arrival of a department store. The department 
store never came. 
</P>
<P>
Because the struggling mall remained the city's largest shopping area, saving 
it became an issue in every City Council election. Near the end, about 1986, 
the mall earned the city less than $300,000 a year in sales tax revenue. By 
contrast, the Los Cerritos Center fattened the Cerritos city budget by $2.2 
million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The city finally gave up. Abandoning hopes of reviving the mall, La Mirada 
officials negotiated a redevelopment plan with Hopkins Development Co. of 
Newport Beach. The developer agreed to scale plans down dramatically from the 
125-store, 30-restaurant, 72-acre mall. 
</P>
<P>
The new development, tentatively called the La Mirada Town Center, will contain 
about 35 stores and half a dozen restaurants spread over half the original 
area. The remaining acreage will be used for about 250 upscale houses and 63 
townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
Before this vision of city planning becomes a reality, Hopkins Development and 
the city must endure about two years of construction and resolve relocation 
lawsuits from some of the former mall's expelled tenants. 
</P>
<P>
But the project represents a new, smaller and better direction, Rew said. "The 
land was too large for a neighborhood shopping center and too far from the 
freeway to be a regional mall. It was just too doggone big."

A CAMPUS GARDEN THAT JUST WENT TO POT

Something has been growing in the Organic Gardens on the campus of Cal State 
Long Beach that isn't the normal squash, green beans and sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
Someone has been growing marijuana plants, according to the university police. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police arrested a man identified as Ramon Sala, 50, on suspicion of 
cultivating marijuana. Sala, who was booked at the Sheriff's Department 
Lakewood substation, is free on $1,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Cultivation of marijuana is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of three 
years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Police conducted an investigation after an anonymous caller tipped the office 
of university President Curtis McCray that marijuana was growing in the 
gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Public Safety Sgt. Jerry Prieto arrested Sala, who was seen leaving the gardens 
carrying "a leafy plant about two feet high," said Toni Beron, university 
public affairs director. 
</P>
<P>
Sala threw the plant under a nearby vehicle and asked, "What marijuana?" before 
Prieto could say anything, Beron said. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the gardens failed to turn up more marijuana, but it appeared that 
five to six plants may have been removed from the area, Beron said. 
</P>
<P>
The gardens at Bellflower Boulevard and State University Drive are rented to 
the public to grow vegetables and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Beron said there has been no previous problem with marijuana in the gardens.

ATLANTIC SQUARE NO 'DONE DEAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(Times Staff Writer) Irene Chang, in her article mistitled "Renewal Project 
Gets a Boost" (Times, Sept. 16), was at a loss to make any sense of the mess 
which we in Monterey Park call the "Atlantic Square Muddle." 
</P>
<P>
The latest flurry of activity was instigated by a number of developments, all 
of which make the questionable project less attractive as an investment for 
Monterey Park. The developments are: 
</P>
<P>
1. Champion Development failed to obtain a loan to cover its part of the land 
acquisition and construction costs under terms originally agreed upon by a 
previous City Council. 
</P>
<P>
2. The new package of conditions requires: 
</P>
<P>
a. An increase in the city's investment of 50%. 
</P>
<P>
b. A loss in security for the city as the lender's interest supersedes Monterey 
Park's interest in case of developer default. 
</P>
<P>
3. The report prepared by Kotin, Regan and Mouchly, for which Monterey Park and 
Champion each paid $5,000 for a total of $10,000, is not an independent 
evaluation of the Atlantic Square project. The above mentioned firm has a 
business relationship with the developer; therefore, the report fails the 
requirement that it be an objective analysis. A decision will be made based on 
this questionable document. The report overstates the net benefit to the city 
by $5.9 million and our city stands to lose $5 million over a 30-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park residents should not consider this project as a "done deal." A 
public hearing has been scheduled for Monday night, Oct. 29, in the Monterey 
Park City Council Chambers. Our concern is that in scheduling the public 
hearing so late, the council may commit the city to the deal before the public 
can express its views. 
</P>
<P>
We urge all residents to contact the city manager's office, 320 W. Newmark 
Ave., for a copy of the report. And by all means, please plan to attend the 
public hearing! It is time to send a message to the Community Redevelopment 
Agency that we want accountability and that CRA (Community Redevelopment 
Agency) business, such as the report, is public business to be discussed at 
open meetings.

GOVERNOR VETOES BAN ON CROAKER FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second straight year, Gov. George Deukmejian has rejected legislation 
to ban the commercial harvest of white croaker fish off the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
In a veto message Thursday, Deukmejian described the latest bill, written by 
Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), as unnecessary because the state 
Department of Fish and Game has closed the area to commercial white croaker 
fishing under emergency regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he expects the fishing ban to become permanent. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "The Department of Health Services has also issued a health advisory 
to sport anglers against the consumption of white croaker taken from the 
affected area." 
</P>
<P>
The ban on commercial fishing was ordered in May after a state Department of 
Health Services study determined that white croaker in Peninsula waters pose an 
unacceptable cancer risk because they contain excessive levels of DDT and PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
But Colleen Beamish, a Rosenthal aide, maintained that the administrative ban 
is inadequate because it is more easily subject to appeals and protests than a 
statute enacted by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a law . . . it's a lot more difficult to challenge," Beamish said. "We 
want to make sure the closure is permanent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on what happens to the emergency administrative ban, Rosenthal may 
reintroduce the proposal next year, Beamish said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also had sponsored a similar bill that cleared the Legislature last 
year but was vetoed by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ban, ordered in May, affects state waters from Point Fermin to 
Point Vicente. The fishing prohibition expired earlier this week but was 
renewed for another 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
The state health department study found that if white croaker taken from 
Peninsula waters were eaten once a week over a lifetime they could cause up to 
one additional cancer per 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have argued that the findings were based on an inaccurate assumption, 
saying it is unlikely consumers will eat only one species of fish, all from the 
same source, for their entire lifetime.

SHERIFF PATROLS TO THE RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about anger! 
</P>
<P>
Your Sept. 6 article regarding the use of Sheriff's Department deputies to 
patrol portions of Long Beach indicates that certain groups are angry. 
</P>
<P>
These people apparently object that there will be less opportunity for citizen 
review, that the matter should be further studied or the morale of the Long 
Beach officers will be adversely affected. 
</P>
<P>
I live in the 5th Council District where there are no assigned patrol cars, 
where a response to a 911 call can (and often does) take hours, where the crime 
rate is steadily increasing and where traffic enforcement is virtually 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
It will take years for the staffing of the Long Beach Police Department to be 
built up to adequate levels. Just how long do the opposing politicians and 
special interest groups expect us to go without police protection? Does it make 
sense to hold the lives and property of Long Beach citizens hostage to their 
concerns while we wait for the Long Beach Police Department to be rebuilt? 
</P>
<P>
Thank God the Long Beach City Council saw fit to throw a life preserver to a 
drowning man even if others would rather wait until after the drowning to 
determine if intervention was required. Please forgive me, folks, for making 
such a fuss thrashing about in the water before I sink.

HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL TIPS; 
</P>
<P>
RECYCLING: GOT OLD BATTERIES, OIL OR PAINT? HERE'S HOW TO CLEAN HOUSE WITHOUT 
HARMING THE ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many recycling centers do not accept hazardous wastes commonly found around the 
home, such as car batteries, paints and oven cleaners. But with a little extra 
effort, those products can be recycled too -- or at least disposed of properly. 
</P>
<P>
Several government agencies hold periodic hazardous waste roundups, where 
household wastes of all types are collected free of charge. The County 
Sanitation Districts has tentatively scheduled its next roundup on Oct. 20 at 
Hollywood Park in Inglewood. For information, call (213) 908-4286. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles also sponsors roundups, although none is currently 
scheduled. To get on the city's mailing list for announcements about upcoming 
collections, call (213) 237-1634. Contact your local city government for more 
information about roundups in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers of "The Recycler's Handbook: Simple Things You Can Do," which is 
scheduled to be in bookstores Nov. 15, make suggestions about how best to 
handle household wastes that are difficult to recycle. The book can be obtained 
by sending $4.95 plus tax and a $1 shipping fee to The EarthWorks Group, 1400 
Shattuck Ave., 25, Berkeley, CA 94709, or by calling (415) 841-5866. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
* BATTERIES. If a service station changes your battery, check to make sure it 
will be recycled. If you replace your own battery, buy the new one from a 
retailer who will recycle the old one. If you cannot find someone to recycle an 
old battery, take it to a hazardous waste facility or to a hazardous waste 
roundup. Do not store old batteries for any length of time in your garage or 
house. 
</P>
<P>
* MOTOR OIL. If a service station changes your oil, check to make sure it will 
be recycled. If not, take your car elsewhere. If you change your own oil, store 
it in a screw-cap container that will not leak, such as a plastic milk jug, or 
use a recycling kit available in hardware and automotive stores. Avoid spilling 
oil on the ground, where it will leak into the ground water or wash into storm 
drains -- and eventually go into the ocean. Take old oil to collection sites at 
service stations and garages or to a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* PAINT. If old latex paints still look fresh, mix them and use them as a 
primer. Some communities have paint exchange programs, where people bring 
reusable paint to trade or give away. Check with your city government. Unusable 
paint should be disposed of at a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* PAINT THINNER. Put used thinner in a jar. After it settles, reuse the clean 
thinner on top, and let the sediment sink to the bottom. When enough sediment 
accumulates, dispose of it at a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS. The EPA estimates that 25% of hazardous wastes come from 
homes. The culprits include lighter fluid, pesticides, furniture polish, nail 
polish, nail polish remover, drain openers, scouring powders, oven and toilet 
bowl cleaners, caulk, mothballs and adhesives. Give unneeded products to 
neighbors or friends who could use them, or properly store and label them for 
future use. Otherwise take them to a hazardous waste facility or roundup.

GOVERNOR VETOES BILLS ON COASTAL COMMISSION; 
</P>
<P>

ON ILLEGAL DEVELOPMENT.

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, a longtime critic of the California Coastal Commission, 
has vetoed two bills aimed at giving the agency more power to crack down on 
illegal development. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the legislation anticipate that the proposals will be revived 
next year, will again clear the Legislature and get a more sympathetic 
reception from the next governor. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting two measures by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), 
Deukmejian said the Coastal Commission "already has adequate enforcement powers 
against violators if used in a prudent and rational manner." 
</P>
<P>
The veto messages by Deukmejian, who decided not to seek reelection this year, 
were released last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
One of Rosenthal's bills would have given the commission the power to impose 
fines and issue cease-and-desist orders without going to court when ongoing 
violations of coastal development procedures are occurring. 
</P>
<P>
The other bill would have required the panel to develop and implement a 
comprehensive enforcement program, in part to determine where illegal activity 
is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
In vetoing the bill that would have allowed the commission to impose fines and 
issue cease-and-desist orders, Deukmejian repeated objections that he raised 
last year, when he vetoed a similar measure. The governor said he appreciated 
the aim of Rosenthal's efforts, but said he does not believe the commission 
"should have the sole authority" to stop illegal projects and levy substantial 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian rejected the second Rosenthal bill as unnecessary. He said that 
rather than devise a comprehensive enforcement program, the commission should 
focus on completing local coastal development plans that have not been written 
for large sections of the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Liebster, a spokesman for the commission, maintained that the panel needs 
expanded enforcement authority, citing a backlog of more than 700 pending 
cases. "Putting teeth in the law would create a deterrent to this abuse. We 
hope the Legislature speedily passes this legislation again in the new 
session," Liebster said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Hart, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said that based on the 
environmental records of the two major party gubernatorial candidates -- 
Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein -- either one probably 
would look more kindly on proposals to beef up enforcement. "It will be much 
easier" next year for the measures to become law, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Hart assailed Deukmejian's vetoes "as yet another expression of the governor's 
irrational vendetta against an important environmental protection agency." 
</P>
<P>
The commission has been a favorite target of Deukmejian's since he took office 
in 1983. Unable to abolish the panel and turn its duties over to local 
government, Deukmejian has drastically reduced its budget and staff. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Rosenthal said: "The governor has had a longstanding 
aversion to the Coastal Commission, but I am surprised that he has allowed it 
to color his decision on this legislation."

BUDGET TALKS 'GETTING CLOSER' IN 11TH HOUR 
</P>

<P>
Federal budget negotiators signaled their intent Saturday not to tamper with 
annual Social Security inflation increases as they drove toward a 
deficit-reduction accord that would avert crippling cuts in government services 
and furloughs of up to 1 million federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, lawmakers said they were exploring alternatives to President 
Bush's proposed capital gains tax cut, which has long divided the two sides and 
appeared to be a major stumbling block in the budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
White House and congressional leaders hoped to wrap up a budget deal in time to 
allow an extraordinary session of Congress today to block $85 billion in 
automatic spending cuts due on Monday and to keep the government running 
without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting closer and closer," said Bush, who was meeting at the United 
Nations in New York with foreign leaders. "It's like pulling teeth." 
</P>
<P>
Federal employees were told to report for work as usual Monday, but they were 
warned that all but essential workers might be sent home if there were no 
resolution of a budget crisis that has defied a solution during more than four 
months of high-level negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Details were sketchy about the eleventh-hour bargaining, but a key Republican 
senator and a top Democratic lawmaker said the accord would not include a 
three-month delay in Social Security cost-of-living adjustments suggested by 
White House officials earlier in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it remained possible that the budget negotiators might agree to 
increase taxes on more affluent Social Security beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to change the cost-of-living index," Sen. Pete V. Domenici 
(R-N.M.) said in a television interview. "We're not going to freeze it." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the third-highest ranking Democrat in 
the House, agreed that Social Security inflation adjustments would continue 
untouched. But he cautioned that other aspects of the budget package remained 
up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Things hit the table, bounce off and come back again," said Gray, who was also 
interviewed on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday" program. "So you really don't know 
what's going to be in the package until there's a final shaking of hands and a 
signing-off." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's persistent call for a capital gains tax cut -- and Democratic demands 
for offsetting increases in taxes paid by upper-income Americans -- remained a 
key stumbling block as weary negotiators tried to resolve remaining differences 
before the fast-approaching deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the discussions on Capitol Hill said they were looking at 
alternatives to a broad cut in capital gains taxes on investment profits in an 
effort to find other means of providing incentives for new business investment. 
</P>
<P>
Both Democrats and Republicans said that a decision to set aside the bitter 
debate over capital gains could clear the way for a settlement of other 
unresolved issues in negotiations expected to continue late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, asked if capital gains might be 
removed from the bargaining sessions, responded: "We're looking at other 
options. . . . We're looking at a lot of options, growth options." 
</P>
<P>
And House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) indicated that Democrats were still 
insisting that a capital gains tax break, which primarily would benefit wealthy 
investors, must be offset by higher income tax rates for richer taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he hinted, it appeared possible that Bush might abandon his 
yearlong quest to include a capital gains cut in the budget package. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at alternatives to a capital gains tax rate change and a general 
rate change," Foley told reporters before joining the negotiations Saturday 
afternoon. "We haven't actually concluded anything yet." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulty of forging an agreement acceptable to both Republicans 
and Democrats, budget leaders remained optimistic that they would reach their 
goal of reducing the deficit by $50 billion in the fiscal year that begins 
Monday and by $500 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
In view of the brighter prospects, Domenici said, Bush should pull back from 
his threat to trigger automatic spending cuts on Monday as called for under the 
Gramm-Rudman budget law. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are close enough to getting an agreement that I personally do not 
believe it ought to be implemented," Domenici said, "because we will work it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
If an accord is reached by tonight, Gray said, Congress could pass a bill to 
continue government spending at current levels while lawmakers work out the 
details within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But there was widespread concern among the budget negotiators that a package of 
deep spending cuts and tax increases -- even if backed strongly by the White 
House and the bipartisan leadership of Congress -- will face strong opposition 
from lawmakers worried about their reelection prospects on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are talking about the range of $120 billion in net domestic cuts over 
five years, that's tough business," Gray acknowledged. "Everybody wants to have 
deficit reduction, but nobody wants to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
One apparently unresolved item is a Democratic proposal to tax a greater share 
of Social Security benefits paid to upper-income retirees. For elderly 
individuals with incomes above $25,000 and couples above $32,000, half of 
Social Security income is currently subject to taxation. Democrats have 
suggested raising the limit to 85%. 
</P>
<P>
But many lawmakers are wary of tampering with Social Security at all. Congress' 
last attempt to raise taxes on more affluent retirees, designed in 1988 to help 
finance health benefits for "catastrophic" illnesses, produced such a strong 
backlash that the law was repealed barely a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, however, will not have to vote today on the contents of any budget 
agreement. The House and Senate were called into session primarily to approve 
stopgap legislation to postpone the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts and to authorize 
the government to keep running at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
This year's long battle over the budget has delayed congressional action on the 
13 regular appropriations bills for 1991. No spending measures have passed both 
houses and been sent to the President for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a budget accord, Congress will be forced to devote the final days 
of the current session to a hurry-up effort to limit spending and raise taxes 
to the levels called for under the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences over policy, two of the participants in the 
negotiations were united in at least one cause. 
</P>
<P>
White House budget chief Richard G. Darman and Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), both from New England, are big fans of the Boston Red Sox, 
now two games ahead of the Toronto Blue Jays in their battle for the American 
League East championship. 
</P>
<P>
A television set outside the negotiating room was tuned to the Red Sox-Blue 
Jays game. A cheer erupted when the Red Sox won in the bottom of the ninth 
inning Friday night, one of the few moments when reporters actually learned 
what the participants were doing during their bargaining sessions.

SOVIETS PLEDGE TROOPS IF U.N. APPROVES ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: MOSCOW MAKES ITS FIRST UNEQUIVOCAL VOW TO SUPPORT A MILITARY 
OPERATION AGAINST IRAQ.

<P>
Soviet combat troops will participate in any military action against Iraq that 
is authorized by the U.N. Security Council, Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We will comply with any decision, with any resolution of the Security 
Council," Shevardnadze said. "And that would include anything regarding the 
involvement of Soviet troops under the flag, under the auspices, of the United 
Nations." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said of Shevardnadze's 
comments, "If the U.N. should move in this direction, we would, of course, 
welcome Soviet participation." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's comment, recorded for broadcast today on the NBC-TV program 
"Meet the Press," was the first unequivocal pledge by Moscow to contribute 
troops to a U.N.-ordered offensive to drive Iraqi occupiers out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
It marked a dramatic departure from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
statement to a joint press conference with President Bush after their summit 
meeting in Helsinki earlier this month that Moscow was staunchly opposed to the 
use of military force against Iraq even if current economic sanctions fail to 
force the Baghdad regime to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Shevardnadze warned that 
war could break out in the Persian Gulf at "any moment." He strongly implied 
that Moscow would support a U.N. force in the region, but he did not say flatly 
that the Soviet Union would send its own troops. 
</P>
<P>
His latest comments came as Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
sought to enlist increased support for U.S. operations in the gulf during 
meetings with a long list of foreign leaders attending the opening of the 
General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a Japanese official said Baker told Japanese Foreign Minister 
Taro Nakayama that, if the economic embargo does not drive Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, "there should be a determination on the part of 
the United States and others to take further strong actions, including the 
military option." 
</P>
<P>
"We are of the same view as the United States that Iraq's aggression threatens 
peace and stability . . . all over the world," the Japanese official said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Nakayama said Japan's post-World War II constitution would not 
permit Japan to send troops to fight Iraq. But he said Baker reported a growing 
consensus in the United Nations "for strong action." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Japanese officials said Bush urged Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu to speed up the distribution of the $4 billion that Japan has pledged to 
support the U.S.-led confrontation with Iraq and to bolster struggling 
economies in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also asked Japan to increase the $3 billion a year that it contributes to 
support U.S. forces stationed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Solomon, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, 
said Bush put particular stress on the need to get money quickly to Egypt, 
Jordan, Turkey and other nations that have been hard hit by the echo effects of 
the economic embargo of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Taizo Watanabe, Kaifu's spokesman, said the Japanese leader agreed that Tokyo 
would do its part to prevent front-line states from wavering in their support 
of the economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe said that Japan is already contributing more to the support of U.S. 
troops than any other country where American forces are stationed. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he quoted Kaifu as saying, "It goes without saying that Japan 
should continue to increase host nation support in the future." He said no 
specific figures were cited on either side. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Kaifu also agreed to consult closely about possible use of the 
strategic petroleum reserves in each country to combat the spiraling cost of 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be necessary to use some reserves to water down speculative price 
activity," Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Bush did not ask Japan to match his decision to release 5 million 
barrels of oil from the U.S. reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Bush accepted Kaifu's invitation to visit Japan early next year although a 
specific date was not fixed, U.S. and Japanese officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush and Baker were seeking additional economic support from Japan, Bush 
was urged to boost U.S. aid to hard-pressed Latin American economies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia that he will soon send to 
Congress legislation providing trade concessions to the drug-impacted economies 
of the Andean region, the White House said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush promised to include cut flowers, Colombia's most lucrative legal export, 
in the tariff-cutting legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria said Bush made the promise after thanking Colombia for increasing its 
oil production to help offset the embargo against oil from Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua said she asked Bush for an 
extra $200 million to revive her nation's crumbling economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have inherited a bankrupt country," she told reporters. "I am not at all 
shameful to recognize that I have asked for economic support."

BRADLEY'S FOREIGN TRAVELS TOP ALL BIG-CITY MAYORS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIPS: BUT TOP CITY HALL AIDE SAYS THE MAYOR'S OVERSEAS VISITS HAVE HELPED MAKE 
L.A. A MAJOR TRADE CENTER.

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, back from Monaco after a 17-day tour of Western Europe, has 
traveled abroad at public expense more often in recent years than any mayor in 
the nation's 10 most populous cities, The Times has found. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley will take to the skies again on Oct. 20, when he is scheduled to lead a 
delegation to Leningrad to welcome Los Angeles' newest sister city, said a 
spokesman for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong trip to the Soviet Union, city records show, will mark the 15th 
time that Bradley has ventured overseas since January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
During the last eight years, records show, the mayor has been away from the 
city a total of 690 days -- twice the number that his predecessor, Sam Yorty, 
logged in his first two terms when Bradley began to criticize his travel. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani defended Bradley's travels, saying that his efforts 
overseas have helped build Los Angeles into a major foreign trade center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to write about (the mayor visiting) exotic cities that most people 
have never been to," Fabiani said in an interview. "But when you see the 
positive impact on our economy, the trips are well worth it." 
</P>
<P>
A survey of other big-city mayors found that only Annette Strauss of Dallas 
travels as often as Bradley. Strauss has made 15 foreign trips on city business 
since 1987 -- but unlike Bradley, none of her travel expenses are paid with 
public funds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayors in the nation's five largest cities excluding Los Angeles -- New York, 
Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston and San Diego -- took a combined total of 14 
foreign trips over the last four years. Six of the trips were taken by Houston 
Mayor Kathy Whitmire. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who returned from Europe on Thursday, declined to be interviewed about 
his travels. His most recent journey included visits to England, France, Italy 
and West Germany to pitch Los Angeles as a popular tourist destination. The 
mayor was scheduled to spend the last five days in Monaco at an airport 
conference, but cut his stay there two days short because there was no 
remaining business on his schedule, said spokesman Bill Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
Other big-city leaders lag far behind Bradley, according to an informal survey 
of travel by mayors in the 10 largest U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode has not taken any foreign trips since 1987, 
according to his staff. Goode considers each travel request and "if it is not 
directly related to some important city action or city responsibility, he 
doesn't go," said press secretary Karen Waddington. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Mayor Coleman Young has taken only one foreign trip since 1987, said 
Robert Berg, the mayor's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"Various invitations come through but generally there is enough happening here 
at any given time that he is just reluctant to get away for too long a period 
of time," Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss said all of her foreign trips are designed to "let the world know the 
opportunities of Dallas and the advantages of doing business in Dallas." Her 
expenses, Strauss said, are paid out of a private fund established to finance 
overseas travel by city officials to promote Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's travel expenses are paid primarily from four accounts -- his mayoral 
budget, political campaign funds and the city's harbor and airport departments. 
The bulk of his travel costs come out of harbor and airport funds that cannot 
be used for general city services. City officials were unable to provide a 
figure for the cost of all of Bradley's travels. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley raised the travel issue in 1969 when he first ran against 
then-incumbent Yorty. Yorty "clearly doesn't display a desire to be mayor of 
this city," Bradley told a City Hall news conference. "You can see this in the 
frequency of his departures from the city." 
</P>
<P>
City records show that Bradley has been away from the city on 690 dates since 
September, 1982. He had criticized Yorty for being absent from the city a total 
of 328 dates during an eight-year period ending in 1969. Despite the criticism 
from Bradley, Yorty was absent 372 days during the first 43 months of his third 
and final term. 
</P>
<P>
The attendance numbers for Bradley and Yorty include time spent outside the 
city campaigning for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
It made no difference, Bradley said in 1969, whether Yorty called his trips 
trade missions or junkets. Yorty's absentee record and "his lack of full-time 
leadership is one reason why this city is in trouble today," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Running Los Angeles today, however, requires devoting more attention to foreign 
interests than 15 years ago, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, as the city's role as an international trading center has grown, it 
has become necessary for the mayor to represent the city in negotiations abroad 
with major foreign trading companies. That was not something that Sam Yorty was 
doing in the '60s. But it is something that has paid off for the mayor and the 
city a hundredfold with the Olympics, with a strong local economy that has been 
remarkably resistant to recession, and with enormously large and bustling 
airport and harbor facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Yorty scoffed at the frequency of Bradley's travels. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to make Los Angeles an international city and I did," Yorty said. 
"He is just having a good time at city expense." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's out-of-town travel became a subject of political debate during last 
year's election. 
</P>
<P>
Before Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky dropped out of the mayor's race, he said that 
Bradley had devoted too much time "jet-setting around the globe" while Los 
Angeles faced ever-rising problems of crime, traffic congestion and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, who Bradley narrowly defeated last year, noted in an 
interview that 17 people were slain in Los Angeles County last weekend while 
the mayor was in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going on in this city. It's a war," Holden said. The 
amount of time Bradley spends away from the city, he said, is "a judgment call 
and the mayor's got to decide that for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Holden is one of the few council members who has not left the city in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The council has canceled six of its last seven regularly scheduled meetings 
because so many members were either out of town or unavailable. The council 
last met on Sept. 18 and will not meet again until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Council President John Ferraro joined Bradley for the last two weeks of the 
European trip. Other council members who were out of town include Marvin 
Braude, Joan Milke Flores, Joel Wachs, Robert Farrell, Joy Picus, Gloria Molina 
and Michael Woo. 
</P>
<P>
While the mayor is away from the city, he is required to notify certain council 
members in writing that they will serve as acting mayor in his absence. During 
the European trip, Ferraro, Braude, Flores and Ernani Bernardi took turns 
serving as acting mayor, depending on who was in town. 
</P>
<P>
When Bradley travels abroad, he routinely puts in long days and seldom takes 
any personal vacation time, according to his staff. Spokesman Chandler said the 
mayor's only vacation in the last decade was a 1983 trip to Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't see how exhausted the mayor is after he gets back from these 
trips," Fabiani added. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's wife said that she long ago stopped accompanying her husband on 
out-of-town travel because he is too busy meeting with diplomats and attending 
official functions. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to New Zealand 13 years ago for two weeks and I never saw the man," 
Ethel Bradley said in an interview. "I can stay home and not see the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's wife said she wishes the media would follow Bradley on his foreign 
travels so they could see the warm reception he receives abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked when I first went to England and Japan and saw how he was 
treated," she said. "Everything is done for him just like he is a king."

LEGISLATIVE TERM LIMITS BACKED BY BIG MARGIN

<P>
The California electorate is in a mood to join Oklahoma in imposing term limits 
on state legislators in a broad-based revolt against failures in Sacramento, 
The Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
Voters are angry at the Legislature as an institution rather than its 
individual members, the survey indicated. When it comes to the lawmakers in the 
citizens' districts, there seems to be no great fervor to "throw the rascals 
out." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a revolt against incumbency, not against incumbents," observed Times 
political analyst William Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the motivation, California voters are moving toward following the lead 
of Oklahoma, which on Sept. 18 became the first state to impose term limits on 
legislators. Colorado also has a term-limit proposal on its ballot Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Americans traditionally have been more critical of legislative institutions, 
such as Congress, than they have of their local representatives. What is 
different this year is that Californians, and voters in a couple of other 
states, have an opportunity to strike out against the institution while still 
voting for its members. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in this state will have two term-limit initiatives to consider. Either 
one would dramatically change the political system in Sacramento. Right now, 
both are favored by comfortable margins, The Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 131, sponsored by state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, would limit 
legislators to 12 consecutive years in office and impose limits of two 
four-year terms on most statewide elective offices, such as governor. The 
measure would do much more: It would permit candidates for state office to help 
finance their campaigns with tax money if they adhered to spending limits. It 
also would impose some ethics rules by limiting gifts and honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll found voters to be supporting Proposition 131 by 50% to 34%, 
with 16% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 140, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, 
would impose tighter term limits -- six years total in the Assembly and four in 
the Senate. The governor and other elected statewide officials could serve two 
four-year terms. The measure would also eliminate the Legislature's pension 
system and cut back substantially on legislative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Voters like Schabarum's initiative even more than Van de Kamp's. Proposition 
140 was favored by nearly 2 to 1 in the survey -- 55% to 28% with 17% 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Both term-limit measures similarly were leading by big margins in a Times poll 
last month. Both have added slightly to their support since then. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also were asked their opinions of Proposition 128, the sweeping 
environmental protection proposal called "Big Green" by its sponsors and 
denounced as "the Hayden initiative" by its opponents. People were split 
virtually down the middle on the measure, exactly as they were a month ago: 44% 
in favor, 42% opposed and 14% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll conducted telephone interviews with 1,892 registered voters for 
a six-day period ending last Tuesday night. The margin of error for this size 
poll is 3 percentage points in either direction. Susan Pinkus, assistant Times 
Poll director, supervised the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Californians on Nov. 6 will be asked to consider 28 ballot measures, including 
a modern-record 13 initiatives. Voters told The Times Poll this is a bit much. 
Three-fourths of those surveyed agreed with the statement: "There are so many 
initiatives on the ballot with so many involved issues that an average voter 
cannot make an intelligent choice." 
</P>
<P>
The main cause of this ballot overload, they said, is that "the Legislature has 
failed to do its job of making the laws." The No. 2 culprit, voters contended, 
is that "special interests use initiatives to get around the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Californians have a very low opinion of the Legislature as a whole. Asked to 
rate its job performance, the voters' reply was 2 to 1 negative: 24% approval, 
48% disapproval and 28% not sure. Naturally, people who disapprove of the 
Legislature are the most likely to support the term-limit initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also have an unfavorable impression of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco), the Legislature's most powerful and best-known member. But 
their opinion of him is less negative than of the Legislature overall. It is 
31% favorable, 39% unfavorable and 30% not sure. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Speaker Brown symbolizes the Legislature as an institution. It is 
the institution that voters are especially angry at, not with individual 
members. 
</P>
<P>
When voters were asked whether their local Assembly member "deserves to be 
reelected or not," the answer was 46% yes, 17% no and 37% not sure. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature is in trouble. Incumbents are not," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the term-limit measures spans the entire political spectrum -- 
Democrats as well as Republicans, liberals as well as conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
But Big Green -- Proposition 128 -- provokes sharp divisions. Democrats favor 
the environmental protection measure by 2 to 1. Republicans oppose it by more 
than 2 to 1. Independents support it, but by a smaller margin than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a significant gender gap involving Big Green. Men oppose it by 10 
points; women support it by 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Younger people tend to support it. People middle-aged and up oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
It is most popular in the state's two largest urban areas -- Los Angeles County 
and the Bay Area. The rest of Southern California tends to oppose it. Voters in 
the Central Valley farm belt are split. 
</P>
<P>
The negative public image of Big Green's controversial chairman, Assemblyman 
Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), continues to hurt the proposal, interviews showed. 
The voters' impression of Hayden is only 27% favorable, against 43% unfavorable 
and 30% not sure. When people who dislike Hayden hear that he is pushing Big 
Green, their opposition to the measure doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Big Green point out that the liberal assemblyman has his eye on 
running for the new state office of environmental advocate that the initiative 
he co-authored would create. Voters, by 2 to 1, said establishing this office 
would be "just creating another layer of government and little will get 
accomplished." They rejected the notion that the new post would "help a lot to 
clean up the environment." 
</P>
<P>
A key element of the supporters' strategy is to inform voters that chemical 
companies are among the measure's chief opponents. This knowledge made 
virtually no difference to voters surveyed by The Times. Half were told that 
chemical interests were trying to defeat the measure and half were not. Both 
groups voted about the same way. 
</P>
<P>
What did seem to make a difference was a voter's assessment of California's 
"quality of life." People who believed it had stayed the same or improved in 
the last decade tended to oppose Big Green. Those who thought the state's 
quality of life had declined -- and they represented nearly 6 in 10 of those 
surveyed -- tended to favor the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the complex initiative seeks to solve several environmental 
problems. Among other things, it would ban cancer-causing chemicals in food, 
save old-growth redwoods, tax oil companies to pay for potential oil spills and 
reduce gases that contribute to global warming and depletion of the ozone 
layer.

PESTICIDE LEGISLATION SIGNED BY GOVERNOR;

Gov. George Deukmejian, saying California consumers "will not learn to live 
with higher prices for maggot-infested fruit and vegetables," signed into law 
Saturday six bills intended to give the state new weapons in its battles 
against agricultural pests. 
</P>
<P>
A key law in the package, designed to crack down on the Mediterranean and 
Mexican fruit flies, will set up a center for pesticide research within the 
University of California. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion over Los Angeles and surrounding 
cities over the last year prompted a prolonged outcry by residents and their 
legislative representatives in Sacramento, claiming the spraying was 
unhealthful. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation signed by Deukmejian seeks to address these concerns by calling 
for the UC center to search for alternatives to malathion and other 
agricultural chemicals now in common use. 
</P>
<P>
Three other bills in the package call for tougher inspections at air and sea 
ports of entry, increased sterile fruit fly production and a long-term state 
Department of Health Services study of the effects of aerial pesticide spraying 
on humans. 
</P>
<P>
Another bill places the Legislature on record seeking to reduce pesticide use 
"to protect urban residents and the agricultural industry." The sixth bill 
signed slightly raises a state assessment charged on the sales of registered 
poisons. 
</P>
<P>
"California's consumers and farmers deserve better protection from agricultural 
pests," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), a foe of the malathion aerial 
spraying in Southern California, the UC pesticide research center bill passed 
the Assembly 47 to 24 and the Senate by 32 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural representatives opposed the measure because they said malathion 
was the best way to cope with the fruit fly infestation that threatened the 
livelihood of their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit fly problem was a hot topic of discussion during the legislative 
session that began in January with a flock of bills on the subject introduced 
in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, the debate prompted a rare committee of the whole in the Assembly 
-- attended by all members -- to listen to top scientific and government 
experts testify on the infestation, the health risks of spraying malathion and 
alternatives to using the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
A Times poll that same month showed most Californians believed that the 
Deukmejian Administration should temporarily halt the aerial spraying of 
malathion until more studies were conducted regarding its possible health 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly infestation appeared to abate in the last two months and 
agricultural officials are hopeful they can declare full victory by early 
November. Some scientists, however, are convinced the pest is entrenched 
statewide and detection of future infestations is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governor also signed a bill to create a new crime of stalking, 
described as maliciously following or disturbing the peace of others with the 
intent of making them fear death. It was authored by Sen. Edward R. Royce 
(R-Anaheim).

SAN DIEGO RESIDENTS ASKED TO CUT WATER USE AFTER AQUEDUCT BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred thousand residents in southeast San Diego County were 
admonished Saturday to reduce water consumption by at least half -- and in some 
neighborhoods to brace for intermittent water stoppages -- because of a break 
in one of the five main aqueducts that bring imported water here. 
</P>
<P>
Three water districts that serve suburban cities and rural neighborhoods 
declared a Stage 4 water emergency, meaning that outdoor watering and car 
washing are banned and customers are urged to cut back on water use indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials also were turning off meters that serve crop irrigation lines 
and construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
The break in the aqueduct occurred Friday. Officials said the rupture of the 
84-inch aqueduct -- which normally pours 70 million gallons of water daily into 
the area -- might not be repaired until next Friday. Workers were awaiting a 
replacement 20-foot steel pipe section being fabricated in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Once it's delivered, we'll work around the clock to get it in," said Lester 
Snow, general manager of the San Diego County Water Authority, which sells 
wholesale water to the county's individual public water districts. 
</P>
<P>
He said cause of the break in the reinforced concrete pipe, in the Scripps 
Ranch area of San Diego, was still unknown Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He said lessons are being learned from the incident: just how well San Diego 
might fare if an earthquake ruptured one or more of the five pipelines that 
bring imported water into San Diego from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good illustration of what we'd have to do if we had an earthquake -- 
by asking the public to immediately reduce its water consumption and by asking 
the various water agencies to share their water through inter-connections," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those affected by the waterline break were residents of the cities of 
Santee, El Cajon, La Mesa and Lemon Grove, and the unincorporated communities 
of Rancho San Diego, Spring Valley, Lakeside, Alpine and Otay along the 
U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Within the city of San Diego, only residents in the northern suburb of Rancho 
Bernardo might experience a drop in water pressure, Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Snow said there should be no serious water shortages if customers cut 
back on water and the affected agencies are able to buy water from neighboring 
districts -- as they were doing Saturday -- other water officials still made 
dire pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a Stage 4 alert," said Leslie Melenchuk, spokesperson for the Padre 
Dam Municipal Water District. "And there is no Stage 5. This is as bad as it 
gets." 
</P>
<P>
Said Charlie Cassens, spokesman for the Otay Water District, the hardest hit: 
"We have enough water in our storage tanks to keep us until Wednesday, but we 
could run out of water, unless we get every customer to cut back to only the 
most essential water use. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some areas in our district that will experience lower water 
pressure, and there is the possibility of intermittent interruptions in our 
water service as we do some creative 'valving' to keep our reservoirs from 
going dry." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts were under way Saturday to purchase water from other districts. Still, 
sitting literally at the end of the water pipeline from Northern California to 
the Mexican border, the Otay district officials said they weren't bluffing when 
asking customers to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get the word out to everybody that this is no drill or the 
result of the drought or any political maneuvering," Cassens said. "This is an 
actual, physical break in a main artery that brings imported water to San Diego 
County. This is most certainly an example of what could happen to the region in 
an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Cassens said enforcement officers were patrolling the district to look for 
water-wasting scofflaws, and he asked residents to take action if they see 
people not responding to the call for strict conservation.

A 538-foot Norwegian tanker lost power and collided with a tugboat and two 
barges, dumping more than 100,000 gallons of light crude oil into Houston's 
ship channel, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred late Friday 3 1/2 miles east of Texas City, piercing the 
hull of one of the barges and spilling the oil into the water, said Petty 
Officer Mike Sams of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in Galveston. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Garner, president of a cleanup company, made an aerial survey of the spill 
and said it should be evaporated by today.

S&amp;L BAILOUT MAY HIT $600 BILLION, SEIDMAN SAYS

<P>
The final cost to taxpayers of the savings and loan bailout may reach $600 
billion, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman indicated 
Saturday in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman, who also is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., said on the CNN 
television program "Evans and Novak" that the costs would swell because of 
interest paid on money borrowed to finance the bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the total price tag would be for taxpayers, Seidman said: "We talk 
about upfront dollars -- that is, if we had all the money to pay today -- I 
think the best estimate is between $175 and $200 billion." 
</P>
<P>
But Seidman said that excludes interest paid on money that the government will 
have to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably if we borrowed for 30 years at 10%, why that could roughly triple the 
figure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the two major banking regulatory agencies also discounted the 
chances for an even bigger problem with the commercial banking industry despite 
recent financial problems of varying degrees at such major banks as Chase 
Manhattan, the Bank of New England and others. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said that while bank problems appeared to be spreading down the East 
Coast because of weakness in commercial real estate markets, "there's very 
little possibility of (a major bank crisis)." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if we have a major depression, recession over a long period of time 
it will strike heavily against the banking system," he said. "But at that point 
I don't think that will even be the most serious problem we have."

SAUDIS A FADING TARGET FOR BRAZIL ARMS INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE U.S. MOVE TO SELL THE KINGDOM MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS REDUCES 
THE CHANCES FOR THIRD WORLD SUPPLIERS. SOME ARE IN DEEP FINANCIAL TROUBLE.

<P>
Brazil's arms industry, once the biggest in the Third World but now in deep 
financial trouble, desperately needs new business. So as Saudi Arabia stocks up 
on military equipment, Brazil is hoping for a share of the sales. 
</P>
<P>
But with the United States dominating the Saudi arms market, Brazilian 
prospects there seem uncertain at best. 
</P>
<P>
Engesa, a Brazilian company that builds armored vehicles, has been trying to 
close a $2.2-billion deal to provide Saudi Arabia with 318 Osorio battle tanks. 
To please the Saudis, Engesa even calls the tank the Al Fahd, as in King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
Engesa's main competition is General Dynamics of the United States. And a 
$7.5-billion list of planned U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, announced 
Thursday by the White House, includes 150 General Dynamics Corp. tanks, the 
M1-2A Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
Production recently began on a Saudi order of 315 Abrams tanks approved last 
year, and a new list of planned sales to be announced in January is expected to 
include more of the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Israel has objected to proposals to sell such sophisticated 
armaments as Abrams tanks to Arab countries, but the Persian Gulf crisis has 
convinced the U.S. government of the need for more. That reduces the chances 
for other countries to sell less sophisticated equipment to the Saudis, said 
Shelley Stahl, a researcher at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I would guess that a lot of Third World suppliers are going to be sort of 
frustrated now that the United States is willing to sell (the Saudis) more 
stuff because of the crisis," Stahl said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Some Brazilian newspapers already have reported that Saudi Arabia has decided 
not to buy any Engesa tanks. But Miguel Whitaker Pinto, an Engesa executive, 
said the company still has hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any news, good or bad," he said. "We don't have any information 
from the government of Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Engesa sold thousands of troop carriers and other armored vehicles to Iraq 
during the Iraq-Iran War. Those sales stopped in 1987, Pinto said, because Iraq 
stopped paying. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq reportedly owes Engesa $80 million, one reason the company is in financial 
trouble; another is the reported expenditure of $100 million to develop the 
Osorio tank. Pinto said he could not confirm either figure. 
</P>
<P>
He did confirm reports that Engesa owes its creditors about $200 million and, 
under a legal agreement with them, must pay 40% by March to avoid bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Another major Brazilian arms builder is in similar trouble. Avibras, which 
makes rockets and missiles, also owes about $200 million and must pay 40% -- 
$80 million -- in January. 
</P>
<P>
Avibras recently sold Saudi Arabia a shipment of short-range, ground-to-ground 
rockets. The rockets, made for truck-mounted Astros-2 multiple-rocket-launchers 
previously sold to the Saudis by Avibras, were worth up to $70 million, 
industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The company is said to be hoping for more sales to Saudi Arabia worth several 
times that amount. But the latest U.S. package for the Saudis also includes 
rockets and launchers, an indication that Avibras faces competition. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say Avibras' billing dropped from $350 million in 1987 to $10 
million last year. As a result, the company has laid off all but 400 of its 
6,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian military is buying few weapons, making things even harder for the 
arms industry. Fernando Batista Costa, vice president of the Brazilian Assn. of 
Defense Industries, said government austerity measures have cut military 
budgets nearly 50% since March. 
</P>
<P>
He said most of that comes out of equipment purchases because "you can't cut 
out food for the troops." As a result, some weapons-supply contracts have been 
canceled and new orders have nearly dried up. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all at the doors of bankruptcy," said Costa, who operates a company 
that supplies naval electronics equipment. "The whole industry is in 
difficulty."

A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS.

<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush arrived for a three-day visit in New York, where he will discuss 
the Persian Gulf crisis in an address to the U.N. General Assembly and meet 
privately with foreign leaders in an effort to cement the international 
alliance against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Also in New York, Secretary of State James A. Baker III asked Japanese Foreign 
Minister Taro Nakayama to make his country's promised $4-billion contribution 
to help pay for the costs of the Persian Gulf crisis available as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Contradicting previous press reports, Iraq's trade minister said that 
foreigners will be entitled to receive the same quantities of rationed food as 
Iraqi citizens. Meanwhile, the Belgian foreign minister said most members of 
the European Community plan to close their embassies in Kuwait city next week 
because diplomats are running out of water and food. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials in Saudi Arabia have ordered rapid installation of 
special equipment on helicopters to prevent damage caused by blowing sand and 
to improve navigational capability in the featureless desert environment. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military said it is investigating circumstances surrounding the 
wounding of an American soldier shot in the shoulder while on duty in eastern 
Saudi Arabia. Spokesmen said the soldier was listed in good condition at a 
military hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The first French Foreign Legion soldiers arrived in Saudi Arabia,where they 
will join a French troop contingent eventually expected to number 13,000. 
Meanwhile, Britain began a deployment of thousands of ground troops, and more 
Egyptian soldiers were on their way. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism Front: 
</P>
<P>
The State Department renewed an earlier warning to Americans abroad of the 
possibility of Iraqi-sponsored terrorism in Europe and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
France vowed to retaliate if a grenade blast at the Cafe de Paris in the East 
African nation of Djibouti is linked to Iraq. A French boy died and 17 people 
were injured in the incident.

CASTRO SAYS SOVIET CHANGES, GULF CRISIS THREATEN CUBA

President Fidel Castro said that the Persian Gulf crisis and changes in the 
Soviet Union are hurting Cuba, and he appealed to Cubans to work harder and 
make sacrifices to save the island's Communist system from economic collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to foresee what the situation will be in 1991. . . . We might 
have to work with less and less and even with zero," the gray-bearded, 
64-year-old leader said in a three-hour speech Friday night to leaders of 
neighborhood block committees. 
</P>
<P>
The speech marked the 30th anniversary of the so-called Committees for the 
Defense of the Revolution set up by Castro a year after he led the 1959 
revolution and toppled right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista. 
</P>
<P>
Castro cited growing disruptions in vital oil and other raw materials exported 
to Cuba from the Soviet Union and Soviet plans to trade in convertible currency 
and at world market prices from 1991 onward. 
</P>
<P>
These factors, together with soaring oil prices caused by the gulf crisis, have 
put a heavy squeeze on Cuba's sugar-producing, oil-importing economy. 
</P>
<P>
Castro said it is almost inevitable that Cuba will have to adopt an emergency 
austerity plan, known in the official economic jargon as "a special period in 
time of peace." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have already started this by drastically restricting fuel 
distribution and extending rationing of food, clothes and other goods because 
of delays in Soviet shipments. 
</P>
<P>
"The current limitations may become much more serious," Castro said. "So what 
are we going to do? Give up the revolution, socialism, our independence? 
Never."

AMMAN, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz made a flying visit Saturday to Jordan, a 
determined peacemaker in the Persian Gulf crisis, but his mission was shrouded 
in silence. 
</P>
<P>
A ranking Jordanian official said only that Aziz had delivered a personal 
message to King Hussein on "recent developments in the gulf crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The note from President Saddam Hussein was discussed over lunch, 24 hours 
before the Iraqi leader was to speak at Baghdad ceremonies today marking the 
Prophet Mohammed's birth date, a day earlier than the rest of the Muslim 
world's ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Amman diplomats said Saddam Hussein's message could have dealt with any of a 
range of issues, including possible feelers on a political solution to the 
crisis. But there was little in the week that preceded its delivery that 
suggested Baghdad was looking for a way out of the confrontation with Western 
forces over the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago today, Hussein threatened to attack Persian Gulf oil fields and even 
Israel if the U.N.-mandated trade embargo began to strangle Iraq's economy. The 
threat may have been largely rhetorical, but it was enough to send oil prices 
soaring over $40 a barrel in Western markets. 
</P>
<P>
In the same speech, the dogged Iraqi strongman again declared the annexation of 
Kuwait irreversible. The U.N. Security Council's answer two days later was 
adoption of an air embargo to further tighten the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
The half-day visit by Aziz, who flew into Amman in a small Iraqi government 
jet, marked his first visit here since late August, when he met with U.N. 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. The U.N. leader, searching for the 
parameters of a political solution to the gulf crisis, left disappointed. "I 
have failed," he told reporters later. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, King Hussein has continued his efforts as a peace seeker, most 
recently meeting in Morocco with King Hassan II and Algerian President Chadli 
Bendjedid on Sept. 17-20. The three moderate Arab leaders called on Iraq to 
make a commitment to withdraw from Kuwait in the framework of a wider 
settlement. There has been no public answer from Baghdad, and no anticipation 
that one was delivered by Aziz on his visit here. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, King Hussein, the fence-walking monarch of a decidedly pro-Iraqi 
populace, postponed Monday's scheduled opening of Parliament for 48 days, the 
official Petra news agency reported. No reason was given, but the political 
floor of Parliament would give Baghdad enthusiasts a high profile. 
</P>
<P>
In other crisis developments: 
</P>
<P>
* French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas warned that the Paris government would 
retaliate if an investigation proves that Iraqi agents are responsible for a 
cafe attack that killed a young boy and wounded 17 other people in the former 
French colony of Djibouti in East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In the Thursday night attack, still unidentified assailants tossed grenades 
into a cafe crowded with off-duty French servicemen. Djibouti is the major 
staging base for French forces being deployed in Saudi Arabia as part of the 
Western military force there. The first units of the French Foreign Legion went 
ashore Saturday, and the total French commitment is expected to reach 13,000, 
the nation's largest overseas deployment since the Algerian war of independence 
in the 1950s and early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
If Iraq is found responsible for the Djibouti incident, directly or indirectly, 
Dumas told a television interviewer in Paris, "There will be a response from 
France and -- you better believe it -- it will be appropriate to the hateful 
nature of this attack." 
</P>
<P>
In the explosive gulf, military analysts fear that even an isolated incident 
like the Djibouti attack could trigger a series of escalations that could start 
a full-scale war. 
</P>
<P>
* In Cairo, Egyptian military sources told Associated Press that another 1,000 
troops left the port of Alexandria for Saudi shores, and the total Egyptian 
force by the end of the coming week will be 14,000. Egypt has deployed the 
largest non-gulf Arab force in the confrontation. Along with Saudi, Syrian and 
Moroccan troops, and non-Arab Islamic forces from Pakistan and Bangladesh, the 
Egyptians form the front line in the Saudi desert facing 430,000 Iraqi troops 
in Kuwait and the territory north and west of the Iraqi border. The anti-Iraqi 
Muslim troops are backed by even stronger Western ground forces, primarily 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
* The Iraqi government denied reports that it would deny rationed food to 
foreigners beginning Monday. "There are no instructions to deprive foreigners 
from benefiting from the ration cards as claimed by certain hostile media," 
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said in Baghdad. Press accounts of 
the reported restrictions sent a surge of Asian and Egyptian workers seeking 
sanctuary across the Jordanian border.

BONN COURT REJECTS ALL-GERMAN ELECTION RULES

West Germany's highest court on Saturday rejected the current rules for 
December's all-German elections, a move likely to split the left-wing vote and 
further strengthen Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chances of reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Federal Constitutional Court appeared to throw a life 
preserver to small East German parties, which had played a key role in last 
fall's East German revolution but had seemed likely to face extinction in the 
unified German vote, scheduled for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling by the eight-judge panel requires adoption of a new 
election law, parliamentary leaders said Saturday that the Dec. 2 balloting 
need not be postponed. Friedrich Bohl, leader of the ruling Christian 
Democratic party, said that a new plan will be introduced in Parliament this 
week, with swift passage expected. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling has no affect on German reunification, scheduled to occur Wednesday 
under an East-West treaty that went into effect Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The high court objected to a rule that all parties must poll at least 5% across 
a united Germany to win any seats in the new all-German Parliament but that 
parties not competing in the same areas could "piggyback" or join forces to 
clear the hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
That arrangement was fine for the Social Democratic Party, main rival of Kohl's 
Christian Democratic-led coalition. The Social Democrats had hoped to lure 
voters from the reformed East German Communist Party, now calling themselves 
the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), who had no real chance of finding an 
ally big enough to help them over the hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
But the court said that Bonn should apply a separate 5% hurdle for eastern 
Germany, virtually ensuring that the PDS and the East's Alliance 90, a grouping 
of civil rights activists, will be able to enter the new Parliament under their 
own steam. 
</P>
<P>
With a split left-wing vote, the Social Democrats' already poor chances of 
defeating Kohl's center-right alliance have weakened. 
</P>
<P>
East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, a Christian Democrat and close 
ally of Kohl, welcomed the decision, saying that it supports what he has been 
advocating all along. 
</P>
<P>
"The constitutional court's judgment is a resounding slap in the face for the 
electioneering games of the (Social Democrats) in East and West," he said in a 
statement.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scholar in the history of ancient Armenia and Syria left his books two years 
ago and took to the streets to try to free his people from Communist rule. 
After six months behind bars for his dissident activities, Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
is now the president of the smallest Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
Changes are coming so rapidly in the Soviet Union that dissidents do become 
presidents and sit down to negotiate with the Kremlin leaders who had jailed 
them. The visions that seemed so dangerous just months ago now are official 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything flows by so fast," Ter-Petrosyan said about the pace of events in 
Armenia. "We haven't even had the chance to ponder the changes." 
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan is due in Los Angeles as part of a nine-day visit to the United 
States that has also taken him to New York and Washington to meet with U.S. 
officials, including President Bush, and Armenian groups to lobby for support. 
</P>
<P>
"I look on my trip as a consolidation of the Armenian diaspora to help create 
an independent Armenian government," Ter-Petrosyan said. "We need moral, 
material, economic and political help from our brothers abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Help from abroad is especially important to Armenia now, Ter-Petrosyan said, 
because it must learn to live without Moscow's control or support. 
</P>
<P>
At home, Armenians' faith in Ter-Petrosyan and his government of former 
dissidents gives him a mandate previous Communist-led governments never 
enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our only asset," Ter-Petrosyan, 45, said in an interview. "We have no 
experience in managing the state, we have no authority as politicians as yet, 
and so we have only the people's trust to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan, who has written extensively on the cultural relations between 
ancient Armenia and Christian Syria, put his studies aside in 1988 to join 
forces with several other scholars in the Karabakh Committee, a tight circle of 
intellectuals that became the heart of the Armenian nationalist movement. 
</P>
<P>
The scholars regularly drew tens of thousands of people into the streets of 
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, to protest violence against Christian Armenians 
in the neighboring Muslim republic of Azerbaijan and to call for an end to the 
Communist Party and central government's rule in Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The central topic of many of the rallies was the long-festering conflict over 
Nagorno-Karabakh. An Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh has 
voted to join Armenia, but Azerbaijanis consider the territory historically 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The protests brought Ter-Petrosyan to the fore. A tall man with a calm 
disposition, he spoke more often than anyone else at these rallies and worked 
from dawn to midnight for the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good orator because he explains things very well," said Babken 
Ararktsyan, another member of the Karabakh Committee and Armenia's new vice 
president. "His personality is very attractive to the people." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was far from pleased with 
the activities of Ter-Petrosyan and his fellow nationalists. While on a trip to 
view the devastation of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia, Gorbachev 
accused the Karabakh Committee of exploiting the tragedy to further Armenian 
claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, then under virtual siege by Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next weeks, Ter-Petrosyan and several other nationalists were jailed. 
Formal charges were never brought against them. Their detention only increased 
the committee's popularity. When Ter-Petrosyan was released, he was suffering 
from a back ailment so painful that he was hospitalized for four months in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
"He was imprisoned to free his people," Mager Airapetyan, 36, a supply manager 
for a private construction firm, said. "Levon Ter-Petrosyan is our king. Thank 
God our people finally have a king again. If the Communists do not thwart him 
in his struggle for democracy, he will surely be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan had been jailed before for his political activity. As a 
university student in 1966, he spent 10 days in jail for organizing nationalist 
demonstrations and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my friends from the Karabakh Committee started in politics as student 
activists in the '60s," he said referring to the period of political thaw under 
Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev. "We're part of the Khrushchev generation." 
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan's activities contrasted sharply with the political beliefs of his 
father, a founder of the underground Syrian Communist Party, who brought his 
family back to their homeland in 1946 when Ter-Petrosyan was a year old. 
</P>
<P>
But after university, Ter-Petrosyan largely stuck to his study of ancient 
Armenian-Syrian relations, writing six books and more than 70 scholarly 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
And, until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the government allowed little 
nationalist expression. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ter-Petrosyan's ascent to the Armenian presidency seems lightning 
fast, he said it was natural for the Armenian Parliament to elect him almost 
two months ago. Since last year, he has headed the Armenian All-National 
Movement, which won two-thirds of the seats in the parliamentary elections in 
May; the movement had only four seats in the previous Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Ter-Petrosyan's election, Gorbachev telephoned to congratulate him 
and made it clear that he would not treat him as a former dissident. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev seems to have revised his opinion of Ter-Petrosyan, the 
Armenian leader has little complimentary to say about the Soviet president. 
</P>
<P>
"In the very beginning, 1985, Gorbachev was the initiator of the reforms," 
Ter-Petrosyan said. "But since then he has always been the rear guard. He is 
always behind the pace of events." 
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan, nonetheless, said he intends to work with the Soviet president 
to achieve his aims for the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Right after his election Aug. 4, Ter-Petrosyan flew to Moscow and persuaded 
Gorbachev to extend by two months the deadline for paramilitary groups in 
Armenia to disarm. Then he began to disarm the bands himself. He had convinced 
Gorbachev, he said, that it would be dangerous if troops from Moscow were used. 
</P>
<P>
"The people would not have understood if the Russian army was punishing 
Armenian militia, and would have stood up against the army," Ter-Petrosyan 
said. "When we did it ourselves, the people understood and said we did the 
right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the weapons have been turned over, Ter-Petrosyan said, and those 
militia members who kept their arms pledged allegiance to the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The people will respect Ter-Petrosyan's decrees, Ararktsyan said, "because he 
is the first Armenian leader who really represents the people." 
</P>
<P>
But Ter-Petrosyan needs more than public popularity to salvage Armenia's 
economy, reconstruct the areas destroyed by the earthquake, establish a 
democracy and assert Armenia's independence from the Kremlin after more than 70 
years of Communist rule from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Ter-Petrosyan came to power, the Armenian Parliament passed a 
declaration on the republic's independence. 
</P>
<P>
"It calls for gradual increase in the republic's sovereignty," he said. "I mean 
economic independence and our own foreign policy. We haven't had this for more 
than 70 years because we have been monopolized by Moscow. Now we want 
independence here, too."

LEGEND OF LAKE ERIE MONSTER RISES AGAIN;

<P>
Does Nessie, Scotland's fabled Loch Ness monster, have a cousin? 
</P>
<P>
A handful of sightings of huge serpentlike creatures in Lake Erie were recorded 
in 1985 and 1987. But things remained quiet until Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Harold Bricker and his family returned from a fishing trip with a 
new sighting, and monster mania began spreading along lakefront communities. 
</P>
<P>
The Brickers said they saw a large creature moving in the water about 1,000 
feet from their boat. They described it as black and about 35 feet long with a 
snakelike head. It moved as fast as their boat. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my son that I wanted to get a look at it," the 67-year-old Bricker 
said. "My son said: 'No way, that thing is bigger than we are.' So we stayed 
where we were." 
</P>
<P>
Bricker, his wife, Cora, and son, Robert, told rangers at East Harbor State 
Park about what they had seen. 
</P>
<P>
The creature has since been reported by five people on three separate 
occasions, including a Huron, Ohio, firefighter and a 50-year-old woman from 
Pennsylvania vacationing at her Lake Erie cottage. 
</P>
<P>
John Schaffner, editor of a weekly newspaper in Port Clinton, Ohio, has set up 
a toll-free phone line for people to call if they see the serpent. 
</P>
<P>
He also ran a contest to name it. South Bay Besse was chosen in part because of 
the location of the Davis Besse nuclear power plant near Port Clinton -- not to 
mention that Besse rhymes with "Nessie." 
</P>
<P>
The story of the monster in Loch Ness in north-central Scotland dates back 
centuries and is worth tens of millions in tourist dollars to the region each 
year. Three years ago, a million-dollar scientific expedition to find the 
creature turned up just vague sonar readings, but the legend remains. 
</P>
<P>
Any similar effort to find a creature in Lake Erie would be even more difficult 
-- at 240 miles, it's more than 10 times as long as Loch Ness. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Solberg, owner of Huron Lagoon Marina, has offered a $5,000 reward to 
anyone who captures South Bay Besse alive. He also posted a sign at his marina 
calling it the future home of the Lake Erie sea serpent. 
</P>
<P>
But while some people are having fun with the creature, marine researchers 
remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Snyder, a researcher with the Ohio Sea Grant, an organization that 
examines Great Lakes issues, said it is highly unlikely a monster is living in 
Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Loch Ness is old, while Lake Erie is a youngster, geologically 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people kind of assume, like most places in the world, it must be 
millions and millions of years old," he said. "It's not the case. The glaciers 
receded and the area stabilized about 12,000 years ago, which, geologically, is 
just yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
"So the monster really can't be anything left over from the dinosaur days, 
because it's just too young." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder also noted that no sightings were reported before the mid-1980s. He said 
he doubts that a big sea creature could have gotten in from the Atlantic Ocean 
because of the difficulties of navigating the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
</P>
<P>
The sturgeon, Lake Erie's largest fish, can grow to 300 pounds and 10 feet in 
length, but it is on the endangered species list and is a bottom-dweller, 
Snyder said.

LAW: THE NEW JUSTICE COULD SOLIDIFY THE HIGH COURT'S CONSERVATIVE BLOC OR 
FOLLOW A MORE MODERATE COURSE. UPCOMING CASES MAY PROVIDE SOME CLUES.

<P>
The Supreme Court opens its fall term Monday facing a looming question: Will it 
finally have a true conservative majority? 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1956, the justices will take the bench without William 
J. Brennan Jr., the architect of the liberal court that a generation of 
Americans came to know. It was a court that promoted school desegregation, 
abolished school prayer, protected a woman's right to choose abortion, insisted 
on a strict separation of church and state and upheld job policies that gave an 
edge to blacks and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
To his young clerks, Brennan held up his hand, fingers spread, to explain his 
formula: "All you need here is five votes," he would say. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, as a procession of Republican appointees came to the 
court, Brennan had more and more trouble finding five votes. Indeed, since 
1988, with the arrival of President Ronald Reagan's third appointee -- Anthony 
M. Kennedy -- it has been Brennan's conservative rival, Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist, who has generally enjoyed a five-vote majority. 
</P>
<P>
Now -- by mid-October, barring any unexpected developments -- 51-year-old David 
H. Souter will join the court as its ninth justice, and some analysts are 
saying Rehnquist should then have no trouble finding five votes to mold a 
solidly conservative coalition. (The Senate is expected to approve Souter's 
nomination this week.) 
</P>
<P>
Already, Rehnquist has used his new majority to help press the goals of the 
court's conservative revolution, narrowing the impact of anti-discrimination 
laws and giving states more authority to limit abortion. But at times, the 
rightward push has been sidetracked -- when Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and 
Byron R. White have either refused to go along with sweeping Rehnquist opinions 
or even switched sides to join with Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
On June 27, for example, the 84-year-old Brennan, speaking in a weak, gravelly 
voice, read his final opinion -- a 5-4 ruling upholding a federal policy that 
gave blacks, minorities and women a slight preference in seeking broadcast 
licenses. Without explanation, White had joined in the Brennan opinion. 
Rehnquist, for his part, glared straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, that sort of scene is not likely to be repeated. With Souter's 
support, Rehnquist figures to have four -- or perhaps even five -- justices on 
his side in the most contentious cases. And there is no compelling leader, like 
Brennan, to help piece together a winning five-vote coalition for the court's 
rapidly shrinking liberal bloc. 
</P>
<P>
With Souter's support in the coming term, the Rehnquist court could call a halt 
to busing for school desegregation, forbid doctors from telling needy pregnant 
women about abortion and give states the authority to send drug users to prison 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the term, the court might also face a direct challenge to the Roe 
vs. Wade ruling on abortion. If Souter sides with Rehnquist, the constitutional 
right to abortion will probably be wiped off the books. 
</P>
<P>
But that may not prove as predictable as some critics have suggested. Indeed, 
Souter's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee raised some serious 
doubts as to how reliably Rehnquist will be able to count on the New Hampshire 
jurist. 
</P>
<P>
Staffers on the Judiciary Committee dubbed Souter's performance a "confirmation 
surprise." They had spent weeks reading Souter's unswervingly conservative 
writings as a New Hampshire attorney and judge, only to hear him testify to 
moderate -- even liberal -- views on constitutional issues. 
</P>
<P>
Law professors who closely follow the Supreme Court say they are perplexed: Is 
Souter a conservative who will dutifully support the Rehnquist philosophy, or 
is he a closet moderate who will occasionally follow the liberal path Brennan 
laid down? 
</P>
<P>
University of Minnesota law professor Daniel Farber, himself a former Supreme 
Court clerk, says the New Hampshire judge sounded "somewhat like a Lewis 
Powell" -- referring to the former justice from Virginia, who established a 
conservative record on crime but often voted with the liberals on civil rights 
and civil liberties cases. Farber predicts Souter "may be willing to play an 
active role in defending individual rights." 
</P>
<P>
But Georgetown University law professor Thomas Krattenmaker argues that Souter 
was appointed only because he had a faithfully conservative record in New 
Hampshire. "I wouldn't take the transcript of those hearings all that 
seriously," he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Added Louis M. Seidman, a colleague at Georgetown: "There must be a tremendous 
temptation to go up there and say things that people want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Seidman and other skeptics point to Justice Kennedy's example. During his 
confirmation hearings in 1987, Kennedy told senators he supported a right to 
privacy, had an "open mind" on the abortion issue, saw firsthand the value of 
affirmative action and believed court precedents were entitled to "very great 
weight." But, after being confirmed unanimously, Kennedy has voted uniformly 
with the court's conservatives, including in their efforts to overturn the 
right to abortion and to outlaw affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
During Senate hearings earlier this month, Souter displayed a thoughtful tone 
and a thorough knowledge of the law. But he left unanswered how he will vote on 
close cases involving abortion, civil rights, crime and the death penalty -- 
questions that this coming court term almost certainly will be called on to 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few of the major cases likely to come before the court this term: 
</P>
<P>
SEGREGATION: When can a school board end its mandatory desegregation effort? In 
1968, the court ruled that legally segregated school districts had a duty to 
desegregate and to wipe out all "vestiges" of discrimination. But the justices 
still have not made clear when, or if, that duty comes to an end. About 500 
school districts are still under court control, the Justice Department says. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma City school district was found guilty of segregation in 1971, and 
a federal judge ordered the busing of students as a remedy. Six years later, 
the judge said the school system had fully complied with his order and 
terminated all constraints. But last year, an appeals court in Denver ruled 
that the school board may not go back to a neighborhood-school plan because 
doing so would resegregate its elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Oklahoma City, backed by the Bush Administration, say the school 
board's legal duty has ended. But the Legal Defense Fund of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People argues that the board has a continuing 
duty to maintain desegregated schools. The case of the Board of Education of 
Oklahoma City vs. Dowell will be argued Tuesday. Souter will probably miss the 
argument, so he will not get a chance to vote on the case unless the justices 
split 4 to 4. In that event, the court would be expected to order new oral 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: Can the Bush Administration insist that doctors in federally funded 
family planning clinics not discuss abortion with low-income pregnant women? 
Each year, about 5 million women and girls go to subsidized clinics for medical 
checkups and for information about contraception and pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
By law, these clinics may not use federal funds for abortion. Two years ago, 
however, the Reagan Administration issued strict new rules forbidding doctors 
from referring their patients to abortion facilities -- or even telling them 
about abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Those regulations, which have been kept on hold, are being challenged in the 
Supreme Court as an unconstitutional infringement on the free speech rights of 
doctors and the abortion rights of women. Lawyers for the Bush Administration 
counter that the government has a right to have a say in how its money is spent 
and to require that these doctors "value childbirth over abortion." The case of 
Rust vs. Sullivan will be heard on Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
SEX DISCRIMINATION: Can a company exclude women from dangerous jobs to protect 
a potential fetus? The Johnson Controls Co., a battery manufacturer based in 
Milwaukee, forbids women up to age 50 from holding jobs in its factories 
because they are likely to be exposed to lead. The company says this "fetal 
protection policy" is justified because it protects potential unborn children. 
An appeals court in Chicago agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the women say it is a "female-exclusion" policy that blatantly 
violates federal laws against sex discrimination. If the policy is upheld, they 
say, up to 20 million jobs could be closed to women because of potential danger 
to their offspring. The case of International Union vs. Johnson Controls will 
be heard Oct. 10. (Regardless of how the court rules, the fetal protection 
policy is illegal in California under state anti-discrimination laws.) 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: Can a state send a first-time drug offender to prison for life without 
the possibility of parole? 
</P>
<P>
Michigan did just that to Ronald Harmelin after his car was stopped in 1986 and 
he was found to be carrying about 1 1/2 pounds of cocaine. A new Michigan drug 
law -- said to be the nation's stiffest -- requires judges to impose a life 
prison term for those convicted of possessing such a large amount of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union are challenging the law as 
"cruel and unusual punishment," arguing that the sentence is grossly 
disproportionate to the crime. The case of Harmelin vs. Michigan will be heard 
Nov. 5 and will test whether the court will put any constitutional limits on 
the new wave of anti-drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY: Can a state force a Death Row inmate to take anti-psychotic 
drugs so it can execute him? 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the high court said an insane inmate may not be put to death. Michael 
Perry, a Death Row inmate in Louisiana, is psychotic. Doctors say his insanity 
can be treated with medication. State prison officials want to medicate Perry 
forcibly so he may be executed. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for Perry are challenging this move, contending that the 
Constitution does not allow a person to be forcibly medicated so he can be 
executed. The case of Perry vs. Louisiana will be heard Tuesday and will test 
how far the court will go in upholding a state's administration of the death 
penalty.

SIX FORMER SOUTH BAY ATHLETES ARE SEARCHING FOR GOLD WITH RAINBOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Leuzinger High standout Zac Odom -- Mark Odom's younger brother -- is in 
his first year at the University of Hawaii. He's one of six South Bay athletes 
on the Rainbows' football squad. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-11, 165-pound cornerback, Zac Odom will very likely be redshirted this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Odom, who never saw his younger brother play high school ball, thinks 
Zac might be ready to play for Hawaii now. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty good," Mark Odom said. "He can cover well and he's real fast. He 
could definitely play some special teams right now, maybe even some corner. 
He's going to be real good for this school for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Odom is spending his first semester in the dorms at the 
university's Manoa campus. Mark Odom lives 10 minutes away, off-campus in 
Makiki. 
</P>
<P>
He likes it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to put too much pressure on Zac," Mark Odom said. "I basically just 
tell him to work hard and go to class. But I want to give him room to grow up 
and experience some things for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Odoms, there are four other former South Bay players on Hawaii's 
roster, none of whom have seen any action this year. They are: 
</P>
<P>
* Erik Evans, El Segundo High, slot-back, 5-11, 180 -- Evans was The Times' 
first team running back in 1989 and the Santa Fe League's most valuable player. 
He redshirted last season. 
</P>
<P>
* Don Godden, Serra High, wide receiver, 6-1, 170 -- Godden was a member of 
Serra's Camino Real League and Southern Section Division VII championship team 
last season. A redshirt this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Steve Johnson, Serra High, defensive back, 6-1, 201 -- Johnson chose Hawaii 
over UCLA, UNLV, Oregon State and New Mexico. A redshirt this season. 
</P>
<P>
* Ken Talanoa, El Segundo High, defensive line, 6-4, 230 -- Talanoa was a 
three-sport athlete (baseball, football, basketball) at El Segundo. A redshirt 
this season. STUART MATTHEWS

Rancho Santiago had the state's best running back and top scorer going into 
Saturday's Mission Conference game against El Camino at Murdock Stadium, but 
the Warriors' Anthony Daigle outplayed Estrus Crayton, an All-American for the 
Dons, in El Camino's 51-47 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Daigle, a freshman back who transferred from Arizona State, scored four 
touchdowns and gained 199 yards on 30 carries. Crayton finished with 174 yards 
on 24 carries and scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino, ranked No. 2 in the state, improved to 4-0 and 2-0 in conference 
play. Seventh-ranked Rancho Santiago fell to 2-1 and 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rod Harvey started slowly, but opened the second half with nine 
consecutive completions. He finished with 21 completions in 34 attempts for 303 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His 50-yard pass to Calbert Johnson set up Daigle's first touchdown, a 12-yard 
run, with 7:51 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A field goal by Rancho's Tim Hatcher cut the Warriors' lead to 7-3, but Daigle 
scored on a three-yard run for a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho opened the second quarter with an eight-play, 63-yard drive that ended 
with a 16-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Rich Fanti to Trent Julian. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Perez kicked a 32-yard field goal, but the Dons got a 19-yard touchdown 
pass from Fanti to Danny Hooker to cut El Camino's lead to 24-17 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Daigle scored on a 15-yard run, but Hatcher's field goal cut the lead to 31-20. 
Daigle's one-yard run gave the Warriors a 37-20 edge with 2:32 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago cut the lead to 10 with a 55-yard touchdown pass from Fanti to 
Eric McKay, but Mark Harper scored El Camino's next touchdown for a 44-27 lead. 
Crayton then returned a punt 95 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey connected with Marquis Owens for an eight-yard touchdown pass with 9:29 
left, giving El Camino a 51-33 edge, but Crayton returned another punt 75 yards 
for another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 21, L.A. Southwest College 12 -- Southwest had two scoring 
opportunities in the second half, but fell victim to dropped passes, poor line 
play and penalties in a Western State Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our opportunities to win this football game," Southwest Coach Henry 
Washington said. "We're coming around slowly." 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros were 0-2 entering the game, but their losses had come against two 
nationally ranked teams, including No. 1 Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Bobby Webster finished with 128 yards on 30 carries and scored two 
touchdowns. Wes Bender gained 104 yards on 19 carries and quarterback Marco 
Arcipreste, who completed only four of 10 passes for 57 yards, had a 23-yard 
scoring pass to Cotie McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest (1-2) countered with the passing of Craig Manigo, who completed 12 of 
24 attempts for 154 yards and two touchdowns. Both of the scoring passes were 
to Robert Avery, who had three receptions for 74 yards. HEATHER HAFNER

FISHING NOTES: TUNA PROVIDING ANGLERS WITH PLENTY OF ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A variety of exotics dominates fall fishing. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest run of tuna in weeks is under way and the fish are within reach of 
the overnight South Bay sportfishing fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's Aztec returned Monday from a trip to the Cortez bank 
with 103 bluefin tuna that tipped the scales between 30 to 55 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Wegener, captain of the Aztec, said anglers used small mackerel for bait 
and heavy tackle. The tuna gave fishermen an average fight of 25 minutes per 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Band of West Los Angeles was the trip's jackpot winner with a 55-pound 
bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Shroyer of Torrance was a contender with four tuna that weighed 35 to 44 
pounds. He also caught a 26 1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Speece of Torrance caught four fish that averaged 30 pounds. Orun Perdun of 
Torrance caught three bluefin and three yellowtail. Don Davis of Gardena also 
landed four tuna and a yellowtail. Armond Washington of Long Beach caught the 
trip's only dorado. It weighed 28 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Newman of Long Beach caught seven bluefin and two yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Wegener said on a previous trip he had a catch of 140 big-eye tuna. Alan Kato 
of Gardena was the jackpot winner on that trip with a 117-pound big-eye tuna. 
Rich Westhalan of Gardena caught a 109-pound big-eye. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin catches continue to increase off the east end of Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon weigh master Rosie Cadman said the season's total catch has reached 161. 
This does not include fish tagged and released. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Beivold and Chip Upton of Avalon were fishing for marlin off the Avalon 
bank and had a double strike. 
</P>
<P>
After 30 minutes, the marlin surfaced. It was hooked by both anglers. The fish 
weighed in at an even 140 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Marcus Larson of Carson, fishing off San Clemente Island 
aboard the Shogun, pulled out a yellowtail from the kelp. The whopper of the 
week weighed in at 38 1/4 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Unmard of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Happyman at Venice reef, 
caught a 34-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Zahid Hussan of West Los Angeles, fishing off San Clemente Island aboard the 
Blackjack, caught a 30-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lee of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Diawa off Catalina, caught a 26-pound 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Trullinger of Torrance, fishing aboard the Matt Walsh at the horseshoe 
kelp, caught a 17 1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Beyers of Inglewood, fishing aboard the Betty G off Catalina, caught a 
16-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Garcia of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Spitfire off Venice reef, 
caught a 14-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Halibut have been showing at local fishing areas along with 
bonito and sculpin. Yellowtail and bullet tuna catches are reported off 
Catalina and San Clemente islands. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Del Mar trip to Venice reef had a catch of 
230 sculpin, 45 calico bass, 39 yellowfin croaker and 17 halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Spitfire fished the bay and returned with 80 bonito, 31 calico bass, nine 
yellowtail and a barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod special had a catch of 310 rock cod and a lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished the outside of rocky point for 
163 sculpin, 150 bonito and 74 calico bass.

UNITED GERMANY MUST CONFRONT CHAOS ONCE LOCKED SAFELY BEHIND IRON CURTAIN; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: A UNIFIED GERMANY IS PART OF CENTRAL EUROPE, NOT OF THE WEST. ITS 
POLICIES WILL REFLECT A GROWING PREOCCUPATION WITH NEIGHBORS TO THE EAST.

Publicly, the West has been calling for it for 40 years, but the prayers for 
German unity were like St. Augustine's youthful prayers for chastity: "Make 
Germany one, Lord -- but not yet." 
</P>
<P>
God heard the first half of that prayer. One year ago, German unity was a 
remote contingency, not expected for decades. On Oct. 3, the church bells will 
ring and the banners will wave from the Rhine to the Oder -- the Fourth Reich 
will be open for business. 
</P>
<P>
The good news first. German fascism is dead and there are no prospects for its 
revival. Nobody in German history has been as thoroughly discredited as the Man 
with the Mustache. He ruined Germany in 12 short years. In 1945, the German 
people were starving, occupied, hated and covered in a shame that, half a 
century later, has still not departed. Some lessons people learn. Fringe groups 
are with us always, but the overwhelming majority of Germans are sincere in 
saying they don't want to go this route again. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the news that may not be bad, but is a little less comfortable. A 
reunified Germany will be far more powerful than the old West German state, and 
it will use its power in ways that will sometimes make its old partners 
unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Some commentators argue that reunification doesn't mean much. Germany, they say 
hopefully, is not a great power. For years to come it will be too absorbed in 
the expensive and divisive process of integrating its communist East and 
capitalist West to throw its weight around. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong answer. The new German state is already a superpower. The Soviet Union 
and the United States are both trying to sponge off the Germans -- the Soviet 
Union, to avoid disintegration; the United States, to prop up its shaky Middle 
Eastern position today, to prop up a shakier dollar tomorrow. The deutsche mark 
is the world's second-most-important reserve currency, and it continues to gain 
on the dollar. If reunification goes badly, taking longer and costing more than 
even the latest set of escalating estimates, Germany will be restless and 
unhappy, but it will still be the richest and most influential country in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Germany's new weight in the world doesn't come from the addition of the five 
polluted and flea-bitten states of the old East Germany. It comes from the 
astonishing collapse of Soviet power, and the less rapid and complete, but no 
less real, decline in the U.S. position in Europe. The Soviet collapse has left 
a vacuum in Eastern Europe that German money and influence will fill. For 
countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, Germany will become their 
most important trading partner and most important source of investment capital. 
The Soviet Union is daily becoming more dependent on German credit. Germany's 
diplomats and businessmen will loom large in the old Soviet Bloc -- and that 
influence, in turn, will strengthen their hands in the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Washington hopes that the new Federal Republic of Germany will be just like the 
old Federal Republic of Germany -- only bigger. West Germany was a stuffy, rich 
country firmly tied to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with the United 
States and to a European partnership with France -- a kind of Greater Holland. 
The new Germany, says official U.S. opinion, will be more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong again. The old Federal Republic, West Germany, was part of Western 
Europe. The new Federal Republic is part of Central Europe. There's a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
While Western Europe was busy celebrating the "end of history" in 1990, Eastern 
Europe was descending into the maelstrom of chaos, depression and possibly war. 
Germany, as so often before in its history, is caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
The Iron Curtain was, in its way, convenient for the West. Josef Stalin took 
the poor and quarrelsome half of Europe and imposed rigid discipline on it. 
That left Western Europe, composed of largely peaceful countries with subtle 
boundaries, an opportunity to develop new kinds of international cooperation 
without having to worry about neighbors to the East. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the Iron Curtain means the end of Western Europe's isolation from 
the messy and dangerous part of the Continent -- and Germany feels this more 
keenly than anyone else. This situation in Eastern Europe deteriorates day to 
day. The Bulgarian government warns of famine and bloodshed; Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's own top economic advisers use words like catastrophic and 
cataclysmic to describe the state of their country. At market exchange rates, 
Soviet workers earn about $10-a-month. Bulgarians and Romanians are in much the 
same state. Even the Yugoslavs, the Swiss of the East, earn less in a month 
than Italians make in a week. Nobody talks about the magic of the market any 
more; nobody now predicts anything but further erosion of these standards of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, polls show up to 30% of the Soviet people would emigrate. In 
one of the most ominous signs of the postwar period, Soviet Jews are banging at 
the doors of German consulates, seeking asylum. The Dutch minister of labor 
predicts between one and three million Soviets a year will come West looking 
for work in the early 1990s. Poles, Gypsies, Romanians, Bulgars and Serbs are 
also knocking at the West's back door -- which happens to be Germany's eastern 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
In the age of the Iron Curtain, West Germany could believe that its major 
interests and concerns were with Western Europe and the United States. The new 
Germany still has important links with the West -- but these aren't its only 
major interests anymore. Trying to maintain good relations with its newly 
restless Eastern neighbors, and trying to bring some kind of stability to this 
region is rapidly becoming the No. 1 priority of the all-German government. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign of the new German policy -- and the first cause of trouble 
between the new Germany and its old Western partners -- is the German drive to 
"totalize" the institutional network in Western Europe: To pull the blankets of 
NATO and the European Community over its neighbors to the East. This has led to 
some grumbling and blanket-snatching by its bed mates to the West; not everyone 
is convinced the new arrangements will keep them as warm as the old ones. 
</P>
<P>
The United States worries mostly about NATO. Germany wants to replace the old 
Atlantic Alliance with the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 
"Pan-European" security system that stretches from Vancouver to Vladivostok. 
Maybe, says Washington. The European menagerie could certainly use a Pan-Animal 
Protective Society; but there were lions and leopards as well as rabbits and 
sheep in the zoo. The leopards say they are changing their spots, and the lions 
say they have sworn off red meat; the rabbits and sheep have heard this before. 
NATO worked as well as it did because it had a small number of members who 
shared a large number of common interests. Washington worries the 35-member 
CSCE will have more members who share fewer interests, and so be less 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
France worries about the European Community for similar reasons. The EC works 
because it has a manageably short membership list -- 12 -- and because its 
members are at basically the same level of development. The EC has trouble even 
now with its less-developed members. Adding the poor and chaotic Eastern 
European countries will complicate -- possibly derail -- the whole process of 
European integration. The EC is now dividing between the "deepeners" who want 
to continue the process of integration among the 12, and the "wideners" who 
want to embrace the new democracies of the East. Not surprisingly, Germany is 
leading the wideners. 
</P>
<P>
Germany doesn't want to cause all this trouble, but it hasn't got much choice. 
France, Britain and the United States don't have borders with Eastern Europe. 
The Soviet collapse and the resulting situation there don't hold the same 
opportunities and dangers for the Western countries they do for the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Reunification doesn't happen until Wednesday, and already German policy is 
moving away from its postwar moorings. It won't -- can't -- follow the U.S. 
lead in security policy anymore, and it won't -- can't -- work as closely as it 
used to on economic policy with the French. Rich, talented and troubled, the 
new Germany is an important new player on the international scene. Like it or 
not, the other great powers must learn to move over.

U.S.-MEXICO FREE TRADE: LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD;

<P>
TRADE: WHAT WILL ECONOMIC RELATIONS BE LIKE? COMMERCE BETWEEN THE NATIONS WILL 
BE FREER, BUT THE INFLAMMATORY ISSUES WILL REMAIN. 
</P>

<P>
Mexico and the United States are moving steadily toward an unprecedented 
free-trade agreement that seems likely to alter the relationship between the 
two countries. In five years, when the envisioned accord is in place, what 
should be the shape of U.S.-Mexico economic relations? The Times asked that 
question of three Americans and three Mexicans: 
</P>
<P>
Richard E. Feinberg, executive vice president of the Overseas Development 
Council and a leading policy analyst on economic and Latin American issues: 
</P>
<P>
There will definitely be a free-trade pact well before 1995. The effect 
altogether will be to convince Americans and Mexicans that the historic Mexican 
decision to integrate itself into the North American market is definitive and 
irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
Traders and investors will come to see North America as a single market. On the 
downside, however, there is about a 20% chance that the Mexican political 
system will enter into a crisis that would, in turn, increase bilateral 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, there will still be a northward migratory flow, which will only 
be a serious problem if the U.S. economy is not healthy and is unable to absorb 
the influx. 
</P>
<P>
Diego Asencio, retired U.S. Foreign Service officer and chairman of the 
Commission for the Study of International Migration and Cooperative Economic 
Development: 
</P>
<P>
Despite the agreement and (Mexico's) improving economic position, we know that 
the economic development process itself is destabilizing and, in the short term 
at least, it might even increase the amount of immigration to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
We could also anticipate that there will continue to be a drug problem, as a 
sore point in relations. There will continue to be a problem with regard to the 
protection of the rights of migrants. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiation of the agreement is going to be a four-alarm fire in itself. A 
lot of the questions that one could project into the future will be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
I do consider the agreement, however, inevitable. It's just such a clear and 
obvious benefit that, although there's going to be resistance to it on both 
sides, I think its existence is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a political commentator and senior researcher at the new 
Center for the Study of the United States at the National Autonomous University 
of Mexico: 
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the United States are again revising the terms of their endearment. 
</P>
<P>
What is not clear is the realistic possibility that this agreement will reflect 
the feelings of both countries for the long term. The worst scenario is that we 
sign an agreement that will only reflect the immediate political interests of 
both administrations: of Carlos Salinas (de Gortari) in Mexico and of George 
Bush in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The questions in Mexico are related to the democratic transition that this 
country has to witness in the next five years. If Mexico does not become a more 
representative, open, tolerant, truly democratic and honest, clean political 
system, the kind of agreement Salinas might sign with the United States could 
be interpreted by large sectors of the Mexican population as a self-serving 
treaty that will only politically benefit Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest challenge for the United States is to see Mexico not as a 
single-issue country, as a country just in terms of immigration, or in terms of 
drugs or in terms of certain trade agreements or in terms of energy, as is the 
tendency now with the Iraq-Kuwait conflict. 
</P>
<P>
If American society sees this as an opportunity to extract concessions from 
Mexico because Mexico is weak and the government needs the agreement, then the 
deal might very well reflect the United States' short-term interests but not 
the long-term interests of the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San 
Diego: 
</P>
<P>
A free-trade agreement would set the stage for a much greater integration of 
the two economies, but it will certainly not remove inflammatory issues like 
drug traffic and illegal immigration from the U.S.-Mexico agenda. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, to the extent that a trade agreement improves economic conditions in 
Mexico, the short-term impact may be to stimulate migration to the United 
States by giving more Mexicans the means to finance migration, to stay in the 
United States for longer periods of time and to bring their dependents from 
Mexico. So economic integration will accelerate the integration of the two 
societies. 
</P>
<P>
But most Americans prefer economic integration without any social residue. 
There is no evidence, for example, that the U.S. public is prepared to accept a 
level of immigration from Mexico -- whether legal or illegal -- that 
approximates what is likely to occur during the next six years, with the 
increased cultural diversity that it will bring. Moreover, the conventional 
wisdom in Washington is that there are too many unskilled, poorly educated 
people coming into the country, primarily from Mexico. This allegedly threatens 
our ability to compete with countries that do not rely on a large, low-skill 
labor pool. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Mexico already have a deeply institutionalized, 
transnational labor market. A free-trade agreement and recovery of Mexico's 
economy will only underline that fact, and intensify the social and cultural 
objections to it in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Zabludovsky, Mexican Ministry of Commerce and Industrial Promotion chief 
of staff for the free-trade agreement negotiations: 
</P>
<P>
The challenge that we face is how to negotiate an agreement that will allow the 
two countries to take full advantage of the complementary natures of their two 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
We are looking for a comprehensive global agreement on services, goods and 
investments. But it is also important to stress that there are some sectors of 
both economies that are sensitive and have to be subject to special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government has already stated that those sectors that are, by 
constitutional prohibition, reserved to the state are not going to be on the 
table: oil drilling, basic petrochemicals, electricity, railroads, mail and 
telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
With a trade agreement, Mexico is going to be able to provide jobs for its 
increasing population. The Mexican position is that one of the best ways to 
relieve the pressure of immigration is to provide jobs in Mexico. Mexico does 
not want to export jobs, we want to export goods. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ramirez, journalist and author: 
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Mexico is going to have to confront three very important problems. 
First, economic reactivation. We cannot continue in our present condition 
brought on by Salinas' policy of (economic) stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
Second, in 1995, Mexico will have finished the process of modernizing its 
economic and productive systems. All new economic opportunities will require 
reaccommodation on all levels, from businessmen to political parties. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a very important element that will influence events in 1995 is that we 
will be deciding on our next president. This president will take office in late 
1996. But, beginning in 1995, the country will experience an internal 
tug-of-war between those presidential advisers who want to succeed Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Mexico will undergo a crisis of expectations: Salaries, conditions and 
social welfare are deteriorating even though people have been promised that 
within a few years things will change.

</P>
<P>
As a recent arrival, the U.S. Ambassador can be forgiven any flaws in her 
knowledge of New Zealand. Mrs. (Della M.) Newman complains that hotels have a 
"mirror on the wall over here and a wall plug over there and none in the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Now, how am I supposed to do my hair?" 
</P>
<P>
She is right, of course. It is the New Zealand way. The wall plug "over there" 
is for convenience in making a cup of tea or coffee without calling room 
service . . . . The plug is missing from the bathroom for fear that with all 
the water around, using an electrical appliance could produce a shocking 
hairstyle. Standard current is 240 volts, Your Excellency.

This is the debut of a new Opinion feature -- excerpts of editorials and

</P>
<P>
Except during coups or earthquakes, the only time the American media deigns to 
mention the Philippines is when the issue of the U.S. military facilities in 
the country crops up. 
</P>
<P>
Such a focus has given the impression that the bases lie at the heart of the 
U.S.-Philippine relationship. (But) as President Corazon Aquino put it: "The 
(bases) . . . are not the heart of our economy nor the soul of our political 
well-being." 
</P>
<P>
We support Aquino in her avowed determination that . . . the two governments 
shall "craft a new relationship -- one more equitable, mutually beneficial and 
respectful of each other's sovereignty." We hail, too, her declaration that "it 
is now necessary for our government to work with the United States for 
arrangements regarding the orderly withdrawal of their forces from our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
These are . . . not sugarcoated terms of surrender to U.S. demands to extend 
the bases' lease.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kissinger not unexpectedly joins the hawks you quoted in your Sept. 14 issue 
who dismiss sanctions and argue for a decisive military strike in Iraq now. 
Even though sanctions imposed by virtually the whole world have never been 
tried before, these "analysts" know they won't work. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, they say, our waiting game will get harder to sustain. Harder than 
what, one wants to ask, war? 
</P>
<P>
What's really getting harder is restraining the hawks. Their own proclivities 
and all that bright new military hardware glinting in the desert sun blind them 
to other courses of action. But there are some. Iraq depends for water on two 
vital rivers that originate outside its borders. It's been suggested that they 
be dammed. This might precipitate military reaction by Iraq against the 
countries damming them but perhaps we could negotiate with Britain, France and 
Germany to come to the defense of these countries. Perhaps we could wait for 
sanctions to take their inevitable toll. 
</P>
<P>
There is in all of us a tendency to let frustration and fear impel us to use 
force before trying other measures which might achieve our goals. We have to 
remember, though, that our boys will be killed and our economy devastated by 
giving in to this tendency. Let's hope Bush resists the advice of hawks like 
Kissinger whose role in Vietnam should have put an end to invitations from The 
Times and other responsible members of the media to give his discredited 
advice.

HUSSEIN'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his article "Beware Timidity in the Endgame" (Commentary, Sept. 23), former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger leads a debate on policy objectives in the 
Persian Gulf which centers on events in the Vietnam War. And it is not hard to 
see that he has mostly accepted the critics' view of history. 
</P>
<P>
"For economic and political reasons, I doubt a stalemate can be sustained." The 
official military policy in Vietnam became defensive in 1970, under President 
Nixon. "A prolonged stalemate is likely to undermine the domestic stability of 
our Arab associates." Does anybody remember Cambodia? 
</P>
<P>
Is it realistic to assume that there is no debate on the gulf crisis because we 
continue to measure our foreign policy by events which took place during the 
Vietnam War? Would the U.S. be isolated in a "military crunch"? Should we place 
our head into the lion's mouth again? Kissinger's most revealing statement 
concerns an "imperative to create the right conditions for an equally rapid 
withdrawal." And to that end I credit him with orchestrating the U.S. exodus 
from Vietnam, an event that could have been bloody and torturous, particularly 
in the final hours. We might not have such good grace in extricating ourselves 
from the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger has taken a good look at recent history and Vietnam when he calls for 
an outcome "more consistent with long-term stability." By this I take it that 
he means a policy not formulated by the hawks who want to bomb Baghdad. Or is 
it Hanoi? It's all too chillingly familiar to me, and quite probably to the 
former secretary.

<P>
More and more it appears that we are moving toward war in the Middle East. And 
the thought is frightening. We must not let it happen. 
</P>
<P>
The charges and counter-charges by Hussein and Bush, the tit-for-tat moves by 
each to gain advantage fill one with horror. If this continues, war is 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
We must find someone such as King Hussein of Jordan, PLO leader Yasser Arafat 
or some Islamic religious figure to talk to Saddam Hussein to try to get him to 
soften his position. We can't get him to change his mind by using belligerence. 
He angers Bush; Bush hurls threats. The danger of war increases.

If we go to war, we can defeat the Iraqis -- but we won't win the war. No one 
wins wars any longer. And once more we will fill body bags, and we will plunge 
once again into that prolonged pain and suffering which always accompanies war.

HUSSEIN'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Robert E. Hunter's "Capital in High Fever for 'Low-Cost' War" 
(Commentary, Sept. 26): 
</P>
<P>
Hunter goes on and on about what the U.S. should not be doing in the gulf, yet 
he gives no realistic alternatives on how to accomplish what are widely 
perceived to be U.S. goals in the region. 
</P>
<P>
He does, however, raise some interesting questions about U.S. will. 
</P>
<P>
It is no coincidence that Iraq's information minister pointed out that "Iraq is 
willing to sacrifice over 100,000 men for this cause." He then went on to ask 
"is the United States willing to sacrifice 100,000 U.S. lives for this cause?" 
Good question. Are we? The Iraqis obviously don't think so! 
</P>
<P>
Why should Hussein withdraw if he does not feel that the United States has the 
stomach to pay the price that is necessary to force his withdrawal? We must 
clearly convey to Hussein that we are willing to sacrifice whatever it takes! 
Finally, if he does not withdraw by a preset date, we must begin backing our 
conviction with action, or pack up and get out of there.

UNSAFE SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you do when you know with objective certainty that many teen-agers are 
going to have sex -- whether you like it or not, whether religious authorities 
like it or not, whether it is a good thing for them or not? 
</P>
<P>
And that they're going to have sex at a time when the nation is awash in 
unwanted teen pregnancies? And when the AIDS epidemic is hitting lower-income, 
minority communities with a gale-force vengeance? 
</P>
<P>
Duck it, right? 
</P>
<P>
That's what New York City -- the AIDS capital of the nation -- did for years. 
The city Board of Education always voted down proposals to distribute condoms 
in the public high schools (condoms are an inexpensive but relatively effective 
method of reducing the risk of pregnancy and disease). But New York is ducking 
no more. The city board is leaning toward distributing condoms to teen students 
-- despite the sincere and deeply felt opposition of many local religious 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The switch in position was led by Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez, a Latino 
educator in a city whose mayor, David Dinkins, is a black. Said the chancellor: 
"I am a Catholic, but I have to give the best recommendations to (school) board 
members who are faced with the fact that we have been preaching safe sex and no 
sex, and 80% of the kids are sexually active. Then we have to do something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Fernandez is to be congratulated for his leadership -- and for 
keeping his personal religious beliefs separate from his secular 
responsibilities as a public official.

THE $430-DOLLAR QUESTION; 
</P>
<P>
A GLOOMY DIAGNOSIS FOR A SICKLY HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an 18-month study of America's health-care system, a bipartisan 
commission concludes that it is "approaching a breaking point." The nation will 
overlook -- or play politics with -- this gloomy diagnosis at its peril. Sen. 
John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), chairman of the commission, says that 
failure to improve health care could bring the United States to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
The study group consisted of a dozen members of Congress and three medical 
experts appointed by former President Reagan, including a past president of the 
American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As to the sometimes abysmal and often haphazard access to medical help in the 
United States, there was no dissent. The report drew criticism mainly on 
questions of how to change the system and where to find the estimated $72 
billion a year that improving the system will cost. 
</P>
<P>
There are shocks everywhere you look in the 315-page analysis. The number of 
Americans with no insurance of any kind to help pay for medical care now is up 
to 37 million. Another 60 million have some insurance, but not enough. What's 
more, these are not people on the economic fringes. Three-fourths of them have 
jobs or are in families that earn income. 
</P>
<P>
Another shock: Less than half of Americans with incomes below the official 
poverty level get medical help from either Medicaid or Medicare, the two 
immense federal programs for the elderly, the disabled or the poor. 
</P>
<P>
A bare majority of commissioners, eight of 15, voted to require companies to 
provide health insurance for employees. The majority also wants minimum health 
standards for all Americans -- including prenatal care -- and a new system for 
the poor to replace Medicaid. These changes and a decent program of long-term 
care for the elderly would cost most American adults an extra $430 a year in 
taxes. The group also split over just how to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
But the nation has fair warning. Its leaders have no more important task than 
deciding how best to respond.

TURNING 'CIVIL RIGHTS' UPSIDE DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
THIS BILL AUGMENTS RATHER THAN LIMITS GOVERNMENT POWER. IT'S EXACTLY BACKWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM BETHELL, Tom Bethell is Washington editor of the American Spectator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush now has on his desk one more civil-rights bill. It passed both 
houses of Congress this summer by large margins, but probably not large enough 
to sustain a veto. Let's hope that the President does veto the bill, one of the 
worst pieces of legislation of recent years. It has nothing to do with civil 
rights, properly understood. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights are limitations of government power. They itemize things that 
government is not authorized to do to any citizen. For example, the First 
Amendment says that Congress "shall make no law" prohibiting the freedom of the 
press. First Amendment rights are therefore something that all Americans have, 
not just journalists. The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of people to be 
"secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable 
searches and seizures." Rights, then, apply to all citizens and they limit the 
power of government. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, we have been propagandized, mostly by civil-rights lawyers 
who stand to gain, on behalf of a new, "expanded" interpretation of civil 
rights. But these "expanded rights" are misleadingly labeled. They actually 
augment the power of government rather than limit it, and apply to favored 
groups rather than all citizens. In the pending legislation, one of our most 
basic rights -- the presumption of innocence -- is jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1964 Civil Rights Act became law, employers could not legally 
discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, religion, sex or 
national origin. An enforcement provision noted that only if an employer 
"intentionally engaged in" an unlawful employment practice could courts step in 
and "order such affirmative action as may be appropriate." The key word was 
"intentionally." The bill's chief architect, the late Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, 
said: "The express requirement of intent is designed to make it wholly clear 
that inadvertent or accidental discrimination will not violate the title or 
result in the entry of court orders." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, in a 1971 case, Griggs vs. Duke Power, the Supreme Court declared 
on its own authority, citing not one line or word of legislative language, that 
"Congress directed the thrust of the act to the consequences of employment 
practice, not simply the motivation." This was judicial activism at its most 
extreme. 
</P>
<P>
After Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the Supreme Court, a majority was 
willing to overturn some of the worst affirmative action rulings. In 1989, the 
court made it harder to claim that an employment practice was discriminatory 
just because it had a "disparate impact" on the labor pool. The burden of proof 
was shifted from companies to complainers. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, "civil-rights groups" didn't take kindly to this. So they went to 
their friends in Congress, who cobbled together the bill that is now on the 
President's desk. An "unlawful employment practice is established," according 
to the new legislation, when a "complaining party demonstrates that an 
employment practice results in a disparate impact on the basis of race" and so 
on. The mere existence of employee groups disproportionate to the labor pool 
from which they were selected will give civil-rights lawyers the opportunity to 
file suits. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the presumption of innocence is discarded. If the bill is 
signed, the illegal intention to discriminate can confidently be imputed to 
innocent people, simply because they hired workers in non-approved proportions. 
</P>
<P>
About the only way employers can guard against such a costly outcome is to hire 
in the approved racial and ethic proportions in the first place. In short, 
adopt quotas or risk trouble from award-seeking lawyers. The long-time 
civil-rights advocate Joseph Rauh conceded in July: "There may be some people 
who would use quotas as a basis of avoiding" such lawsuits. But, he added: "So 
what?" 
</P>
<P>
So, it would be bad for the country if companies feel they have to hire people 
on the basis of ethnic criteria rather than merit. That outcome is almost the 
opposite of what the original Civil Rights Act was intended to achieve. Is it 
any surprise that race relations in this country appear to have deteriorated 
when we have accepted, with very little debate, such a degraded interpretation 
of the old and honorable idea of civil rights? 
</P>
<P>
Bush has let it be known that he is "eager" to sign a civil-rights bill. 
Clearly he is fearful of being labeled "anti-civil rights." But liberals should 
not be allowed to monopolize political vocabulary. Civil wrongs should not be 
permitted to masquerade as civil rights. If Bush can stand up militarily to 
Saddam Hussein, he can stand up rhetorically to the NAACP's Benjamin Hooks.

U.S. TROOPS UNDER A U.N. COMMANDER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE KIRKPATRICK, Jeane Kirkpatrick's comments are excerpted from her 
syndicated Washington column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Published reports citing anonymous sources multiply, saying President Bush and 
his team want to work through the United Nations on a solution to the gulf 
crisis -- seeking a Security Council authorization for military action under 
Article 42 of the U.N. charter. No action has been so taken since June, 1950, 
when the Security Council -- then boycotted by the Soviet Union -- authorized 
military force to turn back the invasion of South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
But 1990 is light years from 1950. Today, a war under U.N. auspices would 
almost surely involve a degree of U.N. control and a U.N. commander who would 
be more attentive than the United States to the sensibilities of countries in 
the region (because that is the way the United Nations works). 
</P>
<P>
Could the United States, which has far more troops in the gulf than any other 
country, accept international control of its forces? Indeed, has the U.S. 
President the legal power to relinquish command of American troops to U.N. 
control? Is the authorization of Congress required for the President to 
delegate that control? 
</P>
<P>
If the Bush Administration relies on the Security Council to authorize the use 
of force, will it delegate to the Security Council the power to set the terms 
for ending such a war? 
</P>
<P>
In considering the options, Bush and his advisers will surely remember that, 
while a President may be able to delegate control over a war, he cannot 
delegate the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
It was the President who responded in force to Iraq's invasion. It was he who 
dispatched 100,000 American troops and rallied an international coalition in 
support of this action. It was he who invested U.S. power and reputation in the 
gulf. And it is he who will be praised or blamed by the American people for its 
outcome.

DURING THE U.N. WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN, LET'S REMEMBER WE HAVE A CURRENT AND

As a former teacher and principal, I am keenly aware that society sees patience 
as one of the most valued qualities in those of us who work directly with 
children. But, given the evidence of how much we have raised the ante on 
growing up, it is now clear to me that in matters involving children, patience 
is no longer a virtue. In fact, at a time when children and childhood are in 
terminal danger, being patient is irresponsible if not outright criminal. 
</P>
<P>
There is a critical need for action in behalf of children, but some formidable 
obstacles stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
* The rapid pace of changes in the structure of the American family, 
traditional institutions and gender roles seems to have outstripped our ability 
to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
* Changing social conditions, especially the greater availability of drugs and 
the attendant pervasive violence, along with the widening chasm between the 
"haves" and "have-nots," have made this a time when events are in the saddle 
and ride mankind (to rephrase Ralph Waldo Emerson). 
</P>
<P>
* The habitual thinking of children as "our future" seems to excuse us from 
paying sufficient attention and resources to them in the present. 
</P>
<P>
* Our confusion between "adult time" and "child time" blunts our sense of 
urgency. We accept that it may take a year to initiate a child-rescue program, 
forgetting that the year between 5 and 6 for a child is much longer than the 
year between 35 and 36 for an adult. This fosters our propensity to label 
children as "at risk" when it really should be "in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, more than 80 nations are participating in the World Summit for 
Children at the United Nations. Much of the attention will be -- and deservedly 
so -- on the children of the world's most impoverished countries. Let's hope 
that the United States' response will be generous. But let's remember that we 
have an outstanding, and growing, debt to our own. 
</P>
<P>
Their crisis is real: We are a country at peace, yet an increasing number of 
our children are living in war zones; increasingly, they are forced into 
premature adulthood; in the words of poet Ina Hughs, "their nightmares come in 
the daytime." 
</P>
<P>
The lexicon describing children in the United States today -- crack babies, 
cross-fire children, shelter kids, throwaways -- should prompt us to question 
if we merit the title of "civilized nation." Add to this litany the parlance of 
shameful childhood modifiers: We are no longer shocked when children are 
referred to as homeless, abused, abandoned or missing. 
</P>
<P>
Each time the media makes us aware of yet another horror committed against a 
child, we shudder, then shrug and tell ourselves that, surely, these are just 
aberrations. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year ago a congressional report based on a thorough review of the 
status of our nation's children and youth concluded that childhood is actually 
dangerous for children in this country. The Children's Defense Fund churns out 
facts that might legitimately provide the basis for a class-action suit against 
all adults for endangering the welfare of American children. 
</P>
<P>
As individuals we claim to cherish children while collectively our behavior 
seems to prove otherwise. We debate the merits of child-care legislation in a 
child-care-less society. As the ante is raised on growing up, so is our 
indignation. But this indignation has yet to be translated into an agenda, a 
platform of concrete actions or legislation that unequivocally demonstrates 
that we do care about our children. 
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the World Summit for Children, let's consider some of the 
things we can do in our own country to make our commitment unequivocal (note, 
too, that most of them are cost-free): 
</P>
<P>
* Adopt a child-impact policy. Examine all existing legislation and all 
proposed legislation in light of how it would affect children. 
</P>
<P>
* Appoint a Cabinet-level child advocate general to develop and direct a 
coherent and comprehensive children's policy, create useful and realistic 
legislation and champion children's rights and needs. This, in turn, might be 
effectively carried out at the state and local levels, as well. 
</P>
<P>
* Issue U.S. government children's savings bonds to provide an opportunity to 
earmark resources specifically for improved and better-coordinated children's 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make schools the loci of children's advocacy so that they, as the only 
agency seeing every child every day, can accept responsibility for mobilizing 
available resources and generating new ones as needed. (An advocacy role does 
not mean that the school itself must provide or perform the necessary 
services.) 
</P>
<P>
* Direct any new funding for children's programs to coalitions of 
professionals. We can no longer afford the luxury of specialists working in 
isolation of each other. Much more could be accomplished if professionals in 
health, education, welfare and parenting shared and combined their expertis. 
</P>
<P>
Using the children's summit as a catalyst, we must summon our most passionate 
and compassionate individual and national instincts to ensure that every child 
will develop to the limits of his or her capacity. As a nation dedicated to 
individual freedom and dignity, we can do no less.

THE 1990 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IS CRUCIAL TO WOMEN TRYING TO BREAK INTO 
HIGHER-PAYING JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SHIRLEY M. HUFSTEDLER, Shirley M. Hufstedler, a former federal appeals court 
judge, is a lawyer in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Civil Rights Act of 1990, passed with bipartisan support in the House and 
Senate, would provide significant protection from workplace discrimination for, 
among other beneficiaries, thousands of working women. The Bush Administration 
persists in its threats to veto the act, repeating unfounded arguments that its 
enactment will result in hiring quotas and will create a "lawyers' bonanza." 
Those fears are groundless. If the President capitulates to scare tactics, he 
will deny a necessary shield against employment discrimination and deepen 
severe economic disadvantages women already suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Women, like men, work because they and their families need paychecks to 
survive. Today, almost half of all workers are women, and 72% of all mothers of 
school-age children work outside their homes. Discrimination in employment 
causes grievous suffering for these women; the children suffer, too, because 
depriving mothers of the employment they need to support their families 
handicaps the children as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Rights Act of 1990 would protect women against illegal discrimination 
by reversing a 1989 Supreme Court decision, Ward's Cove vs. Antonio, which made 
it more difficult for women to challenge employment policies that are 
supposedly neutral, but, in fact, have an adverse impact predominantly on women 
and minority employees. 
</P>
<P>
An example of such a policy is a police department regulation imposing height 
and weight minimums on all officers. Although policies of this kind may not 
seem discriminatory on their face, they often operate to exclude a majority of 
women (and men in some ethnic groups as well). Before Ward's Cove, a woman 
could successfully challenge that policy as discriminatory if she proved that 
the height and weight requirements barred most women from employment, and if 
the police department could not prove that the requirements were necessary for 
its operation. Ward's Cove greatly increased the burden of proof on the 
employee who challenges as discriminatory such employer policies and practices. 
</P>
<P>
For women struggling to break into the ranks of traditionally male occupations, 
which usually pay considerably more than traditionally female jobs, the Ward's 
Cove decision struck a harsh blow. These women need the Civil Rights Act of 
1990 to restore their ability to challenge unfair practices that keep so many 
high-paying jobs off-limits to them. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Bush Administration contend that overturning Ward's Cove 
would result in employers imposing quotas by sex and race. No evidence supports 
that argument. Employers did not resort to quotas before Ward's Cove changed 
the law, and there is no factual basis to suspect that employers will do so if 
Bush signs the 1990 act, restoring the situation that existed before Ward's 
Cove. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 act would give women further protection by allowing victims of 
intentional sex discrimination to sue their employers for damages. The Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 provides no possibility of recovering damages to compensate 
victims of proven sex discrimination who have thereby suffered loss or injury. 
A separate statute provides victims of racial discrimination with an 
opportunity to recover damages if they prove their cases. 
</P>
<P>
In opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1990, the Administration contends that 
women will get "multimillion-dollar" damage awards and make lawyers very rich. 
The history of damage awards in race discrimination cases is directly to the 
contrary. The Administration offers no explanation for its contention that 
women, whatever their race or ethnicity, will be awarded huge damages when 
neither men nor women who have suffered racial discrimination have received 
such awards. What is it about working women that makes the Administration so 
nervous? 
</P>
<P>
The President should focus his attention on the cost to working women, to their 
families, and to the national economy of allowing invidious discrimination to 
go unremedied and undeterred. The nation relies on the labor of millions of 
women and minority workers today, and the demographics tell us that we will 
rely even more heavily on them well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
If the President is not moved to sign the Civil Rights Act of 1990 because it 
is conscientiously right or because it is supported by both Democrats and 
Republicans in Congress, he should sign it, because it is vital to the economic 
health and productivity of our country.

<P>
Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, in recent years the most active 
political fund-raiser of any supervisor, has been forced to disqualify herself 
from 69 votes since early 1989, a review of county records indicates. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, Wieder -- in order to comply with county campaign laws 
requiring elected officials to abstain from votes involving donors who exceed a 
certain limit -- has abstained more often than the rest of her colleagues 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of her abstentions arise because of projects directly 
involving the Baldwin Co., an Irvine-based developer whose officers contributed 
heavily to Wieder's unsuccessful 1988 congressional campaign and has since 
brought a bevy of proposals before the board. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder also leads the pack in missed meetings, having skipped 23 board sessions 
in roughly 21 months; Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez missed meetings the next most 
frequently: He has been absent for 14 sessions during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The missed meetings and abstentions threaten to fuel criticism of Wieder, a 
three-term incumbent facing a Nov. 6 runoff. Some observers said in interviews 
last week that Wieder's record reflects her inattentiveness to the nuts and 
bolts of her supervisorial duties and illustrates her close ties to the 
development community, especially the Baldwin Co. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, said the significance of Wieder's record may be overstated, 
and some attribute her high number of abstentions to the supervisor's 
scrupulous attention to declaring potential conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
But a recent $2,500 contribution from the William Lyon Co. State Political 
Action Committee has reinforced Wieder's critics, leading some to complain that 
she is violating the spirit of the county's campaign finance law. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder strongly rebuts that, saying that her absences are primarily the result 
of conducting other county business that happens to fall on meeting days and 
that nearly all of her abstentions are the result of a one-time "accident" -- 
overlooking the limit on Baldwin Co. contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at my activities on the board, you'll see that I'm more active 
than anyone," Wieder said. "Nobody gives you credit for the days you put in 
doing important work, but nobody works harder here than I do." 
</P>
<P>
For Wieder, the abstentions issue traces back to an unsuccessful bid for a 
congressional seat in 1988. Congressional races are notoriously expensive. In 
her fund raising for that campaign, Wieder accepted $1,000 contributions from 
both James and Alfred Baldwin, the brothers who run the Baldwin Co. In 
addition, each of the developers' wives gave Wieder $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, those donations put the Baldwin Co. far above the $1,874 county 
threshold that requires supervisors to abstain from matters involving a "major 
campaign contributor." 
</P>
<P>
As is required by the county fund-raising ordinance, Wieder has disclosed that 
conflict and has properly abstained from votes. 
</P>
<P>
"Her high level of abstention is really understandable, given the high level of 
scrutiny by the press and public on potential conflicts," said Sandy Sutphen, a 
professor of political science at Cal State Fullerton. "It sounds like she's 
trying to be really scrupulous." 
</P>
<P>
But some observers worry that Wieder's acceptance of the contributions has 
effectively silenced her constituents' voices on matters involving the Baldwin 
Co. In addition, Wieder has been forced to abstain on issues in the last 21 
months involving the securities broker Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; 
Smith, another major contributor to her congressional race, and Warmington 
Homes, a South County developer. 
</P>
<P>
"Her constituents should be asking what kind of representation they are 
getting," said Mark Petracca, a UC Irvine political science professor. "Is this 
someone who's really able to represent her district, if she has to remove 
herself from votes because she's taken so much money from a developer?" 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's recent acceptance of a $2,500 contribution from the Lyon PAC -- a gift 
that she said "wasn't even solicited. . . . It came as a very pleasant 
surprise" -- has redoubled criticism of the supervisor's fund raising. Critics 
accused Wieder of exploiting a loophole in the county fund-raising law and said 
she should remove herself from voting on Lyon matters, a step she has not 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's campaign records indicate that she accepted the $2,500 Lyon 
contribution June 4. Her disclosure statement, signed by Wieder and her 
campaign treasurer, lists that contribution as coming from the William Lyon 
Co., but the PAC's statement says the money came from it, not the company. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction is legally important, because taking money from a PAC does not 
trigger the abstention requirement on company issues, and Wieder has continued 
to vote on routine Lyon Co. matters since June 4. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the gift came from the PAC and not the company itself, some 
observers believe that Wieder should stop voting on issues that involve the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a clear attempt to evade" the rules of the county fund-raising 
law, said Shirley Grindle, a former planning commissioner and one of the 
officials who helped draft the law. "I recognize that there is notably one 
supervisor who has abused this, who doesn't see any problem with voting on 
issues that involve a company, even when its PAC is a major donor." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, however, said the PAC and the company are different entities, so 
accepting gifts from the PAC should not affect decisions involving the company. 
Although the PAC is funded largely by company employees, it operates 
independently of the company, and employees are not obliged to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
"This gift was not from the company," Wieder said. "The PAC is constituted of 
an aggregate number of people, and those are the people who made the 
contribution." 
</P>
<P>
Records on file with the county indicate that the William Lyon Co. PAC is 
largely the work of the company. The PAC's most recent disclosure form lists 
eight contributors to the PAC, all of whom either work for the company or are 
married to someone who does. PAC decisions on campaign contributions are made 
by a three-person committee, two of whom are company employees. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no distinction," said Grindle, adding that the county fund-raising 
law was drafted in 1978 and does not directly address the issue of PACs. 
</P>
<P>
"The PAC is the company, its employees and its owners," she said. "This is an 
area that we're going to have to address soon." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's acceptance of the PAC contribution is not the first time that she has 
taken money from a prominent development company's PAC. On March 10, 1988, 
campaign documents on file with the registrar of voters indicate that Wieder 
accepted $2,500 from the Irvine Co. Employees Political Action Committee, known 
as ICEPAC. 
</P>
<P>
On April 27, less than two months later, Wieder voted for a development 
agreement sought by the Irvine Co. on the Laguna Laurel project. That agreement 
was approved by a rare 3-2 vote, with Wieder joining supervisors Don R. Roth 
and Thomas F. Riley to form the majority. 
</P>
<P>
While Wieder's fund raising, particularly from the development community, has 
drawn fire in recent years, some analysts believe that her attendance record 
could end up being even more politically damaging. 
</P>
<P>
In her runoff campaign, Wieder faces Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. 
Neugebauer. City records show that since the beginning of 1989, Neugebauer has 
missed one of 84 City Council meetings and has never abstained from a vote. 
</P>
<P>
During that same period, Wieder has missed 23 meetings for varied reasons, 
including several that were the result of medical problems she wrestled with in 
early 1989. Her attendance has lapsed behind that of her colleagues, most 
notably 5th District Supervisor Riley, who has missed just two meetings in that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Riley declined to comment specifically on Wieder's attendance but did say: "To 
appear at meetings and to be able to vote is one of the most important duties 
of a supervisor. I take that very seriously. The public forum is where we do 
our work." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Riley's remarks, Wieder retorted that her colleague can attend more 
meetings because "his concentration is on the 5th District, and mine is on the 
whole county." 
</P>
<P>
Though 14 of her absences are attributed either to vacations or medical 
appointments, Wieder has missed many of her meetings to attend conferences and 
occasionally to testify in Washington and Sacramento on county issues. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true for her colleagues: Vasquez, for instance, missed several 
meetings this year to travel to Uruguay with the U.S. attorney general and to 
testify in Washington regarding the Santa Ana River flood control project. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder cited her work-related trips and her membership in varied state and 
regional organizations as the reason for most of her absences. And attending 
those meetings, she said, is often the most important thing for the county and 
her district. 
</P>
<P>
"Does never leaving the fifth floor (where board members have their offices) 
mean that you're doing a good job?" Wieder asked. "I think I serve my district 
better by being involved." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some observers say missing the meetings could hurt the 
supervisor. "That strikes me as a problem for her," said Alan Saltzstein, a 
political science professor at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"To the average voter, being at the meetings is an important responsibility," 
he said. "You elect these people. You pay them well, and you at least expect 
them to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Petracca of UCI called the absences "simply inexcusable. Representation only 
occurs when a person is present. It doesn't happen by osmosis." 
</P>
<P>
Other observers said that much of the board's work takes place out of the 
public eye, so simply missing meetings may not seriously harm a supervisor's 
ability to be effective. Sutphen of Cal State Fullerton said Wieder's 
attendance record "might not be as significant as it appears." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, whose attendance has improved markedly in 1990 from the previous year, 
agreed: "I've worked as hard as any of my colleagues, and I've only missed 
meetings when it was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't look just at the numbers," she added. "From the numbers, you can 
make it look like hamburger, or you can make it look like steak."

HIGH SCHOOL AS A SECOND LANGUAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
When Quoc Anh Do spotted a vaguely familiar Vietnamese teen-ager outside the 
administration building at Valley High School, it was as if he had bumped into 
a next-door neighbor amid a throng of aliens speaking gibberish. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you from somewhere," Do said in Vietnamese to the youth, "but I don't 
know where." 
</P>
<P>
But Tuan-Anh Nguyen knew. And Do flashed a thousand-watt smile when Nguyen 
refreshed his memory. 
</P>
<P>
"We met in the refugee camp," said Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
Do, 15, and Nguyen, 19, had parted ways two months earlier thousands of miles 
away at a Thai transit camp that serves as a way station between Vietnam and 
America. They never expected to see each other again. 
</P>
<P>
But here they both were on a warm September morning in Santa Ana, facing a 
truly alien world -- a labyrinthine campus of 34 buildings with thousands of 
unfamiliar people speaking in strange tongues. 
</P>
<P>
For each youth, the reunion meant a toehold on familiarity. At least they would 
have each other with whom to explore high school -- under the best of 
conditions one of the most telling and harsh microcosms of American teen life. 
</P>
<P>
On just about any school day, students like Do and Nguyen from dozens of 
foreign lands take their first tentative steps into American schools, unable to 
speak the language and unfamiliar with the culture. 
</P>
<P>
"This school -- talk about intimidation -- there's 3,000 students here," said 
Kathy Hayden, director of the English as a second language curriculum at Valley 
High. "This is like a city." 
</P>
<P>
Whether they are Latinos fresh out of tiny schools in tiny pueblos -- those 
lucky enough to have schools -- or Southeast Asians who have been subjected, in 
many cases, to more indoctrination than education in communist-run schools, 
thousands of students in Orange County and throughout the state each year 
wander into the world of American education with few clues on what to expect. 
The resulting psychological pressures can be overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
For a glimpse of how students like Do cope with these pressures, The Times 
accompanied him on his first three days of classes and interviewed him and his 
family. What emerged was a portrait of a young man who outwardly was a picture 
of calm, but who inwardly was grappling with a troubled past, the day-to-day 
pressures of adjusting to life in a new land, and an uncertain future. And 
that's not to mention the ordinary wrenching emotional upheavals experienced by 
any adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case where you have an adolescent who arrives at the high school level 
but speaks no English, the problems of language are compounded by the problems 
of adolescence," said Ruben G. Rumbaut, a sociology professor at San Diego 
State University and co-author of the book "Immigrant America." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not only trying to cope with the language, but he's trying to cope with 
issues of identity, especially sexual identity. He also doesn't have that much 
time before his high school years are finished. For someone who arrives at age 
15, the clock is ticking, if you will." 
</P>
<P>
DAY ONE 
</P>
<P>
'I'm Not Very Sociable' 
</P>
<P>
For Do, the clock started ticking at 7 a.m. on Sept. 10, when he left his 
parents' modest but comfortable Diamond Street home for his first day of high 
school. Classes were scheduled to begin at 8 a.m., but Do wanted an early start 
to find out where his first class would be and to meet a friend, 17-year-old 
Thach Ngoc Nguyen (no relation to Tuan-Anh). 
</P>
<P>
Although he had only been in America for two months, Do had already adopted the 
uniform of the American teen-ager -- jeans and high-tops. The temperature on 
that day was expected to soar past 95 degrees, but there wasn't a bead of sweat 
on Do's brow, despite his long-sleeved, buttoned-to-the-neck white shirt. He 
strode out of the home, a multicolored binder tucked under his arm, hoping for 
the best but prepared for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
He said little on the way to the Greenville Street school. But a few days 
before the start of classes, the shy, rail-thin youth with the boyish cowlick 
and wide grin spoke of his expectations of life in an American high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect to make a lot of friends in high school," said Do, answering 
questions through an interpreter. "I don't think the language barrier will be a 
problem because I'm not very sociable. If I can get to know (other students), 
then I'll be their friend." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his gloomy prediction, there would be no shortage of teens to befriend. 
Thousands of students poured onto the campus from every direction, on foot, on 
bikes, in cars and in school buses. Most of the students were Latinos, with a 
good number of Asians mixed in. 
</P>
<P>
Do was designated a freshman by district officials after he was tested over the 
summer, even though he had just completed ninth grade in Vietnam. His inability 
to speak English required him, under Santa Ana Unified School District rules, 
to be automatically placed in ninth grade, although he was eligible to be moved 
to more advanced classes if he displayed extraordinary aptitude. So although he 
had yet to set foot in a classroom, Do was already a grade behind. 
</P>
<P>
Like all other freshmen, Do was directed to go to the administration building, 
where green-and-white computer printouts were posted over the front doors. 
Dozens of confused freshmen huddled around the list, seeking their names and 
the location of their first-period classes. Printed next to "Do, Quoc Anh" was 
the location of his first class -- Building 14, Room 1, where a Mr. Pham would 
conduct a course called "American Issues" for limited-English proficient 
students. 
</P>
<P>
It was after Do found his name and extricated himself from the crowd of 
freshmen that he spotted a seemingly familiar face staring at him from across a 
lawn. After a moment, the memory of Tuan-Anh Nguyen and the refugee camp 
outside of Bangkok came flooding back. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know he was going to be here," Nguyen said later. "I was really 
surprised to see him here today." 
</P>
<P>
Though unexpected, the reunion appeared outwardly undramatic. The youths' only 
evidence of emotion was an exchange of broad smiles. Still, Do clearly was 
pleased to have a companion to accompany him through the confusing maze of 
buildings that was a far cry from Bach Dang Junior High School in Saigon, where 
Do completed ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnamese schools, the students stay in one room while the teachers move 
from room to room to teach a particular subject," Do explained later. "The 
students can only get to know about 40 (classmates). With American schools, the 
students are the ones who move from room to room. Therefore, I can get to know 
many more friends and I like it better." 
</P>
<P>
Before setting about the task of finding their first-period classrooms, Do and 
Nguyen set off in search of Thach Ngoc Nguyen, another former resident of the 
Thai transit camp. They quickly discovered that finding him would not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students milled about, congregating around walls where class 
schedules were posted, greeting old friends with hugs and kisses, and shouting 
to each other to be heard over the ever-increasing din. An administrator, laden 
with a pile of green and yellow papers, walked around yelling, "Maps of the 
school! Mapas de la escuela! Maps of the school!" Do and Nguyen, unable to 
understand either English or Spanish, glimpsed other students taking maps, 
figured out what they were, and took copies. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:53, just seven minutes before the start of his first class, Do abandoned 
the search for his friend and started looking for Building 14. He and Nguyen 
wandered into a couple of buildings, trying to match their location to the 
buildings on the map. 
</P>
<P>
"This school is too big," Do said. 
</P>
<P>
At 8 a.m., the siren signaling the start of classes sounded. Do finally 
realized that the numbers of each building were posted on the walls. After a 
glance at the map, he got his bearings and, with Nguyen in tow, sped off for 
Building 14. They arrived about three minutes late, along with many other 
similarly perplexed classmates. 
</P>
<P>
There were 32 students in the class -- three Latinos and 29 Vietnamese, 
including Thach Ngoc Nguyen, Do's missing friend. Do was assigned a seat in the 
front row by the teacher, La Pham. For Do, attending a predominantly Vietnamese 
class taught by a Vietnamese teacher was a strong cushion to the initial 
culture shock of his first foray into an American classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Though shy and reserved in class, Do's fears of being friendless passed 
rapidly. The trio of Do and the two Nguyens quickly grew, and the three youths 
found themselves accompanied by a small entourage as they blended with the 
onrushing tide of students headed for second-period classes. 
</P>
<P>
Next stop for Do was Building 4, Room 14, where Dennis Maxey cheerfully greeted 
his students as they entered class for the first time at 9:05 a.m. Again, the 
class was mostly Vietnamese, although a few more Latinos were scattered around 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their lack of comprehension, Maxey chattered on for the remainder of 
the period, explaining the nature of the course, the grading system and 
reviewing class rules, such as "act like ladies and gentlemen" and "no eating 
or drinking in class." 
</P>
<P>
"How many of you understand the rules?" he asks. No response. Maxey smiles and 
asks, "How many of you don't understand the rules?" Still no answer. 
</P>
<P>
Do's third-period class was an introductory English as a second language class 
intended to teach students words and phrases typically used in high school 
classes. Do would spend three periods a day in ESL classes in Building 25, a 
portable classroom. The class was crowded -- 36 students, almost evenly split 
between Latinos and Vietnamese -- jammed into the wood-paneled, trailer-like 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The students grouped themselves by ethnicity as they walked in. But the 
teacher, Nancy Bolton-Brenner, put an end to that by asking the students to sit 
in alphabetical order. Do ended up seated in the first row, several rows away 
from the two Nguyens, and surrounded by Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
The class size may have seemed large to American students and teachers, but as 
far as Do was concerned, there was plenty of elbow room. "The classes here are 
smaller than in Vietnam," he said later through a translator. Then, in halting 
English, he said, "There, 45, 50." 
</P>
<P>
Students in the class ranged in age from 14 to 19 -- a common practice in ESL 
curricula, ESL director Kathy Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can accommodate any student beginning in 'A' level," the designated ESL 
class for students who speak little or no English, she said. "Our point here 
is, take as long as it takes to finish high school, but learn English." 
</P>
<P>
As in other first-day classes, Bolton-Brenner -- who speaks neither Vietnamese 
nor Spanish and had difficulty properly pronouncing names -- spent most of the 
period assigning seats and familiarizing the students with the class and the 
school. Speaking in a lilting Southern accent, Bolton-Brenner tried to ask the 
students about their backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"How long have you been in California?" she asked Do. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Ana," he responded. 
</P>
<P>
"You live in Santa Ana?" she said. "And how long have you been in California?" 
At least a couple of the words must of been comprehensible to Do -- he 
hesitated, then replied, "Two months." The scene was repeated in fifth and 
sixth periods, a two-hour block of ESL classes. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Do was scheduled for two of the more social periods at Valley High 
School -- gym class, and lunch. Lunch is scheduled at two different times to 
handle the crush of students, and Do was somewhat confused about which was his 
lunch period. After comparing notes with his friends, Do finally determined 
that the sequence was gym, then lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the gymnasium, the Vietnamese youths grappled with the vagaries of a 
typical American fixture not often found in Vietnam -- the soft drink machine. 
In this case, the machine dispensed a "Frezie," a flavored slush drink. Like 
scientists studying a contraption from another planet, the teens huddled around 
the machine, trying to figure out how to use the coin slot. Eventually they 
figured it out, but Do remained confused by the Coke machine in the gymnasium's 
vestibule -- he failed to understand why the machine continually spit out the 
$10 bill he tried to feed into the dollar-bill slot. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on?" he asked his friends, who were embroiled in a heated 
argument over American currency. "The small one is a dime, the big one is a 
quarter!" one yelled in Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The gymnasium, meanwhile, was utter chaos. More than 200 students sat in the 
bleachers in groups of about 40, as the gym teachers distributed forms for them 
to fill out. Do was separated from his friends again, sitting alone in his 
group while the others were grouped together in a class in the opposite 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
But being separated from his buddies didn't dissuade Do from trying to make new 
friends. He struck up a "conversation" -- mostly in sign language, with a 
Latino student named Pablo seated beside him. Somehow, the two managed to 
transcend the language barrier, and shook hands as they left for fifth-period 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
After two more periods of ESL, Do's first day at Valley High School was 
completed at 2:43 p.m. His assessment? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the teachers are nice and easygoing," he said. "They seem really 
caring about the students." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Do seemed surprisingly unfazed by his first day at school. But again, 
his cool reactions may have been a product of the hardened shell that he built 
up after years of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been through a lot in Vietnam," Do said a week before he started 
classes, "so I guess this ordeal seems small compared to what I've been 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, what Do has been through has already had a profound effect on his 
young life. Do's parents fled Vietnam in 1977, when he was 2 years old, but 
were forced to leave him and his sister, Vi, then 6, behind. They were reared 
by their paternal grandmother and their father's sister. 
</P>
<P>
After six years, the family was granted permission to leave Vietnam under the 
Orderly Departure Program, which allows Vietnamese residents to emigrate to 
America if sponsored by a family member here -- in this case, Do's father, Anh. 
However, their ODP papers were lost and the family waited four years while Anh 
attempted to cut through mounds of red tape. 
</P>
<P>
The family's ODP application was finally approved in 1987, but it took another 
three years before the Vietnamese government allowed them to leave. In the 
spring of 1990, Do learned that he and his sister, grandmother and aunt would 
be leaving Saigon for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard the news that I would come to America, I was really nervous and 
excited," Do said. "I left Vietnam and we went to Thailand, and stayed there 
for a week, near Bangkok, in a refugee camp." 
</P>
<P>
It was there that Do met Tuan-Anh Nguyen and Thach Ngoc Nguyen. Before leaving 
the camp, Do learned that Thach Nguyen was also bound for Santa Ana. They vowed 
to meet again in California. 
</P>
<P>
On July 7, Do and his sister flew to California to be reunited with their 
parents after 13 years and to meet Tommy Do, their 11-year-old brother, for the 
first time. The reunion was a paradox for Do -- although he was being reunited 
with his mother and father, he and his sister were, in effect, being sent off 
to live with virtual strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the excitement of getting acquainted with his new family, country, 
school and friends, Do yearns for the old. "I have hopes of going back" to 
Vietnam, he said. "It won't be long." 
</P>
<P>
DAY TWO 
</P>
<P>
A Question of Timing 
</P>
<P>
Do may harbor hopes of returning to Vietnam, but on his second day at Valley 
High, it was clear he was already getting used to his new life. 
</P>
<P>
Like any other teen-ager, he had no complaints about the news that the school 
day would be shortened because of the intense heat. Confident that he now could 
find his way around the school, he left home 30 minutes later than on Day One 
and arrived at school 15 minutes before his first class. 
</P>
<P>
Do's adverse past in Vietnam and Thailand had at least one positive effect -- 
it's clear that he is adaptable. He strode onto the campus as if he had spent 
his whole life there and made a beeline for Building 14, unaided by a map. 
Several members of his new-found entourage awaited, and gently chided him about 
the reporter, photographer and interpreter chronicling his every step. 
</P>
<P>
With each class shortened to 39 minutes, the teachers found little time to do 
more than continue checking in the new students who unceasingly stream into 
school for the first time and process seemingly endless reams of paperwork. In 
second period, however, Maxey kept the students occupied with a diagnostic math 
test to determine each student's skill level. Do proclaimed the test easy, but 
said he could not finish it because of the shortened period. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt more comfortable today than on the first day because I know my way 
around," Do proclaimed after school. All that was left for him was to get his 
timing straight. 
</P>
<P>
DAY THREE 
</P>
<P>
Signs of Success 
</P>
<P>
By Sept. 12 -- another school day shortened by the heat -- Do bounded off to 
school with enthusiasm. Quiet and reserved at home, he seemed eager to get out 
among his new friends, with whom he laughed, joked and ogled girls. It didn't 
take long for him to become a typical American high school student. 
</P>
<P>
His prediction that he wouldn't be "sociable" turned out to be unfounded. Do 
chatted in Vietnamese with neighbors in just about every class -- and gestured 
in sign language to those who didn't speak Vietnamese. After an ESL class, Do 
and his friends joined a group of Latinos gesturing toward a group of girls. 
</P>
<P>
In class, Do remained studious, carefully copying down assignments and trying 
to keep up with his English-speaking teachers. "If they (teachers) say 10 
words, maybe I can understand three or five." 
</P>
<P>
Even that is quite an achievement for a Vietnamese student who never spoke 
English before. Prof. Rumbaut of San Diego State University said Vietnamese 
students often have difficulty when first learning English because of the 
divergent nature of the two languages. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese language is a tonal language, it's a completely different 
language family altogether," he said. "There are different rules of grammar and 
syntax. In Spanish as well as English, each particular syllable has a 
particular sound associated with it. In Vietnamese, the same syllable can be 
intoned six different ways and would have totally different meanings." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from learning English, there are "a number of risk factors stacked up 
against" older students like Do, Rumbaut added. "Getting good grades may be 
more difficult, and when a student begins pushing 18 or 19 he may decide that 
it's hopeless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Do is successful in school is anybody's guess -- he has the advantages 
of coming from a supportive home environment, but his parents' odd work hours 
make it difficult for them to supervise his work. He has a strong support 
system at school, but few Vietnamese role models. And with 1,000 ESL students 
at Valley High -- about 100 of them Vietnamese -- Do can count on little 
personal attention. 
</P>
<P>
But he definitely showed signs of success. 
</P>
<P>
A week after The Times spent three days with Do, a brief return visit revealed 
that he had shown an interest in diving and was getting more involved in school 
activities -- something many Vietnamese students shun. 
</P>
<P>
Do was, in fact, becoming a typical American high school male. He was last seen 
flirting with four girls.

CORONA COPES WITH GANG TENSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
RIVALRY: AN INFLUX OF ORANGE COUNTY GANG MEMBERS HAS THE FORMER CITRUS TOWN'S 
HOMEBOYS BRISTLING, BUT SO FAR IT'S BEEN JUST A WAR OF WORDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
"OC Rules" is scratched out and painted over with "Crown Town" along the "Alley 
of Hell," a back street near Paseo Grande and 6th Street that bears the scars 
of gang rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
On the alley's walls and fences, Corona's well-established Latino gangs 
constantly hurl spray-painted insults in a war of words with imperialistic 
homeboys from Orange County interested in annexing more turf. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when Corona's population boom was at its height, Orange County 
gang members began moving into the former citrus town, raising fears of 
violence in neighborhoods identified as gang territory. So far, the only sign 
of conflict has been highly stylized graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a gang population, not a gang problem," said Corona Detective John 
Marshall. "Even though they have the propensity for violence, there hasn't been 
any violence." 
</P>
<P>
But, Marshall warned, "that could change. That could change any day. All it 
takes is just one incident." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, city officials have kept close tabs on the situation, concerned 
that if nothing is done to ease tensions between the gangs, the exchange of 
words will turn into an exchange of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Corona has five gangs that have been around for generations, even back to the 
days when the city was called the Lemon Capital of the World. Like their 
counterparts in other cities, Corona's gangs are very protective of their 
barrio, or neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"They consider themselves warriors, or soldiers, to their community," Marshall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The root of the current gang conflict took hold as a tide of families moved to 
Corona from Orange County in pursuit of affordable housing. With them came 
teen-agers belonging to Orange County gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"The ability to move there has increased," said Deputy Probation Officer 
Colleene Hodges, who supervises Orange County's Gang Suppression Unit. "It's 
not like they're moving to just anywhere. These are areas that they can afford 
and be away from their old neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
But what many parents fail to realize, Hodges and Marshall say, is that 
teen-agers can bring their gang ties with them. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents can move to Timbuktu, but it's the kids' choice" to retain their 
gang ties, Marshall said. "They tattoo it on them. Their loyalty is to that 
gang. . . . They bring with them their same habits or attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
These habits include the standard gang activities, such as parties, cruising, 
drinking and, most notably, the spreading of graffiti, which immediately came 
to the attention of city officials and police two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Many (Corona gangs members) say, 'We live here now. We're not going to see 
Orange County graffiti here,' " Marshall said. "For the traditional Hispanic 
gangs that have been in Corona for generations, that's an offense to them." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys from Santa Ana, they disrespect Corona," said an 18-year-old 
Corona gang member who identified himself only as Gunner. "That ain't cool. 
That's not cool, man." 
</P>
<P>
So far, city officials say, they have been able to defuse gang tensions with 
two cleanup programs that erase graffiti, sometimes within 48 hours. Last year, 
the Corona Chamber of Commerce embarked on one such project in Corona's 
redevelopment areas. The city has a similar program in residential 
neighborhoods, and a "graffiti hot line" was started so that defaced areas 
could be reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The graffiti is the beginning of it," Hodges said. "That's the open challenge. 
To ignore it is a mistake, because eventually you're going to have action." 
</P>
<P>
Between November, 1989, and August, 1990, the Chamber of Commerce reported, 371 
locations within community redevelopment areas were cleaned up. Later this 
month, the graffiti removal program will expand citywide, with $40,000 in city 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to graffiti removal, two police officers have been assigned by city 
officials to patrol Corona High School and Centennial High School. The officers 
spot gang members who have been involved in criminal activity, which, so far, 
has been limited to vandalism and petty burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
When a gang member is identified, an officer meets with the youth and his 
parents to try to get him away from gangs and into school associations. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are some signs that Orange County gang members have backed off 
from the graffiti war, Marshall said. Instead, he said, they are commuting back 
to Santa Ana, where they still have ties in their old neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall doubts that street gangs from Santa Ana or Los Angeles would be able 
to establish themselves in Corona, where, he said, gang members tend to be more 
subtle. Outsiders, Marshall added, might stand out, depending on their gang 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few people, if any, fly colors in this town," said Corona Police Lt. Roy 
VanderKallen. 
</P>
<P>
Even the 18-year-old gang member, reflecting on the increase in Orange County 
homeboys, said he has noticed that things have been stable and that the 
newcomers have been lying low. 
</P>
<P>
"First it was one guy, then two or three guys, then crowds," Gunner said. "They 
start throwing their finger signs and hand signs. It's ridiculous. They look 
like cartoon characters." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, he said, "the guys from Santa Ana are really chilling out. The 
older guys are trying to make peace."

OFFICIALS SWEATS OUT THEIR STRESS AT GYM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a $40-million budget shortfall this year that could well jump to $60 
million next year. There is a desperate need for a new Orange County jail, but 
no one can agree on where to build it or how to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints increase daily about the lack of money to house and feed the 
homeless, some of whom live in the bushes right outside the County Hall of 
Administration building. Crime is on the increase and the criminal justice 
system needs more judges and more courtrooms. The problems often appear 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
So how do some county officials keep their heads when others have lost theirs? 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider skips lunch and heads for the 
YMCA -- a small, colorless gym with basketball and handball courts across the 
street from the county government complex in downtown Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
He and others, from high-ranking county administrators to judges and 
prosecutors, pass up the three-martini lunches in favor of sweating it out 
pumping iron, running, playing basketball or toiling on bodybuilding machines. 
</P>
<P>
They say the daily exercise is their antidote to the stress and frustrations of 
managing thousands of people, spending billions in taxpayers funds, prosecuting 
criminals and ordering them to Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes the edge off. There is so much stress associated with this job," 
Schneider, the county's top administrator, explained after a daily workout last 
week. "There are so many arrows and bullets flying in my direction that when I 
work out it's like things slow down and I can dodge the bullets easier. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because I'm not hyped, you know, I'm not skitzed, I'm not jumping up 
and down all over the place, freaking out. It's not that I'm tired, I actually 
have more energy, but there's a calmness, a mellowness." 
</P>
<P>
Officials like Schneider, 43, County Planning Director Thomas Mathews, Superior 
Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald, and county prosecutor Kelly W. MacEachern, 
have been making the daily treks to the gym for years. They are among hundreds 
of county employees who exercise their lunch hours away each day by running in 
Santa Ana or working out at nearby gyms and health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
They set their schedules so they can spend an hour or more each day lifting 
weights, running, playing basketball or handball, swimming, pumping a 
stationary bike, pulling make-believe oars, or working on a variety of aerobic 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
They very seldom deviate from what they call their "addictions" and "euphoric 
experiences." All of them confessed that they become "cranky, irritable, and 
not much fun to be around" if they are denied their daily exercise. 
</P>
<P>
After a workout, they return to their desks and eat chicken or peanut butter 
sandwiches, a salad or fruit they brought to the office in a brown paper bag. 
They have a camaraderie with others who go to the gym regularly and feel that 
the daily routines keep them young, mentally alert and thin. 
</P>
<P>
MacEachern, 36, prosecutes child molesters, an extremely stressful job because 
"you know that little children are being abused sexually and physically." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could survive without working out," said MacEachern, a mother 
of four children ranging in ages from 1 to 10. "I'm working full time and have 
four kids, three of them in soccer, three of them go to tutors and one is in 
gymnastics . . . as you can imagine, our evenings are really full." 
</P>
<P>
She runs 3 miles four times a week before she comes to work. Then four days a 
week she visits the gym at the Santa Ana-Tustin YMCA at 205 Civic Center Drive. 
Fridays are reserved for "social contact," when she has lunch with other 
lawyers in her office. 
</P>
<P>
What if she had to stop working out? 
</P>
<P>
"I would have ulcers and would be screaming at everybody all the time," she 
said. "I think the tension would build up so badly I probably would have either 
physical problems or emotional problems." 
</P>
<P>
Even since he came to work for the county in 1974, Mathews, 47, head of the 
county Planning Department in the Environmental Management Agency, has been 
working out at the YMCA gym. 
</P>
<P>
"Exercising is as much a part of my life as eating and sleeping," Mathews said. 
"I look better in my clothes and feel better and more professional. I take care 
of myself physically because that is part of the package of maintaining myself 
as a professional." 
</P>
<P>
Mathews' department evaluates and makes recommendations for development 
projects in unincorporated areas of the county. Many times, the department 
feels pressure for the public as well as from powerful developers. 
</P>
<P>
"Working out allows my mind to loosen up enough to accept other alternatives or 
view problems from other angles," Mathews said. "Generally speaking, people who 
work out regularly are very positive people. Positive people want to be around 
positive people." 
</P>
<P>
"Ego is a big part of it. . . . Ego is a very fundamental characteristic of the 
human animal. I recognize that and I don't have a problem with that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald years ago traded in his lunchtime 
martinis for a basketball and weights. 
</P>
<P>
When Fitzgerald, 55, was in private practice in the early 1970s, he attended a 
lot of lunches. 
</P>
<P>
"It was customary for business reasons to have lunch with folks and tip a few 
martinis. So I was a regular noontime imbiber," said Fitzgerald, often 
considered one of the toughest judges in Orange County and who has sent six 
convicted murders to Death Row in San Quentin. "In 1974, I quit drinking for 
good on April Fools' Day. A year later, I was involved in heavy athletics and 
ever since then it has been noontime workouts rather than noontime drink-outs." 
</P>
<P>
He can often be seen on the YMCA basketball floor at noon playing pickup games 
against men half his age. After he exhausts himself he goes downstairs to the 
weight room for another 10-minute workout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost a euphoric experience," he said. "This would be a very stressful 
job for most people. . . . I know one thing when I go and work out at noontime: 
I am really mellow in the afternoon session of court. Sometimes in the early 
part of the day I am pretty much a grouch." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, who, as county administrator makes $129,000 a year, and heads a 
budget of $3.3 billion and a county work force of more than 16,000, said many 
of the pressing problems at his level are not solvable. For example, he said, 
the state cut $13 million to the county for services and there is nothing the 
county can do to make up the money. 
</P>
<P>
Problems like this send him to the gym. "It takes the edge off -- I can't 
really think of a better way to put it. 
</P>
<P>
"As funny as it may sound, it gives me even more strength to get through the 
day," said the wedged-shaped Schneider, who has a vigorous exercise and 
handball schedule Monday through Friday. On weekends he surfs and takes long 
walks along the beach with his wife, Sally, and 9-year-old son, Nicolas. 
</P>
<P>
"When I don't work out I get very irritable. I get tense and I don't have very 
much patience. I feel more stressed out and more pushed to the wall," Schneider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who work out religiously become preachers of sorts spreading the 
word of exercise as a way to better physical and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, who has run a marathon and numerous triathlons, hands out free 
one-week passes to the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more respect for someone who cares enough for how they look and how 
they feel than someone who doesn't," Schneider said. "I know how much work it 
takes and how much effort you have to put into it. 
</P>
<P>
"People who say to me, 'I don't have the time,' I don't buy that. I don't have 
time either, but I make time. It is a priority -- it is what you want to do 
with your time and your life. I'm not looking for longevity, I am looking for 
quality."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK GEBE MARTINEZ: MILITARY STILL WANTS TO MANAGE THE NEWS

<P>
Tom Hayden is one of those people you never forget. 
</P>
<P>
That is, Tom Hayden the tough-talking lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps at 
Camp Pendleton, not the California assemblyman who used to be married to film 
star Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
"I was south and she was north," he offers with a clear note of contempt for 
the woman who demonstrated her opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam 
War by visiting North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden was facing the press on an August morning, shortly after the crisis in 
the Persian Gulf began. And, like the military men who controlled information 
during the Vietnam War, he had firm ideas about what he wanted the press to 
carry away from this encounter and what he did not want them to know. 
</P>
<P>
He did want the press to believe that the American soldier was ready to 
withstand the horrors of chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
But he was not pleased with the skeptical questions that arose from the gaggle 
of reporters invited there for a demonstration of equipment designed to protect 
against chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq was threatening to employ its estimated 2,000 to 4,000 tons of material in 
its poison gas arsenal. The chemical weapons, mostly made up of mustard gas 
which causes blisters and burns the lungs, were used by Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein during the war with Iran against Iranian targets and his own citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
Although American troops have trained in desert-like conditions, military 
officials said they believed the protective equipment to guard against a 
chemical attack has never been used by U.S. forces in combat. The news media 
had asked to see how the equipment worked and Lt. Col. Hayden appeared eager to 
demonstrate that if called on to fight a war, the troops would be ready. 
</P>
<P>
"If the enemy thinks he can drop that stuff on us and not suffer the 
consequences, he's out of his mind," Hayden said, minimizing the likelihood the 
chemical weapons would be used. "I think the people we would go up against are 
well aware of the retaliation capability of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters had just witnessed a Marine demonstrate, step by step, how to don the 
charcoal-lined clothing, a protective hood equipped with an air filter, and 
rubber boots and gloves. In order to protect against the chemicals, no skin 
could be exposed. 
</P>
<P>
But since the start of the crisis, numerous news reports had pointed out the 
110-degree-plus desert heat in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The fair-skinned Marine was in the full gear for only a few minutes. But as he 
removed the hood, his face was turning red, and beads of sweat had formed on 
his forehead. He was standing on the California coastline in weather dozens of 
degrees lower than what he might encounter in the Saudi Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
How long could the troops stay in those heavy suits in that heat? What if an 
attack lasted longer than just a few minutes? 
</P>
<P>
Those were questions Hayden did not want asked. 
</P>
<P>
"You put that in the paper or whatever you are writing for," he sternly scolded 
me, "you are going to do a disservice to the people who have to wear them. You 
are going to let the enemy know how long it will be before he is in 
discomfort." 
</P>
<P>
My observations were included in my report the following day. 
</P>
<P>
Having come from San Antonio, where five military installations help make the 
defense industry the city's largest employer, I was accustomed to military 
personnel being touchy about having news reporters on their bases, even during 
peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
And with the threat of war in the Middle East, I expected strict limits on what 
we would be able to see and photograph. I did not expect to be warned by Hayden 
that my report would be helping the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I remembered his comment about Fonda and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in American history, citizens watched that war from their 
living rooms as nightly television newscasts chronicled the number of U.S. 
servicemen killed each day. 
</P>
<P>
And as citizens became more cynical about U.S. involvement in the undeclared 
war, the military intentionally distorted or kept secret information that would 
have shown just how badly America was losing the war. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if the American public, through the news media, had been dealt with 
more openly early on and been given a more accurate portrayal of the war, then 
maybe Vietnam would not have become a long, embarrassing nightmare for the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe, if citizens could be told how unbearable those anti-chemical suits 
are in the scorching heat, then maybe their expectations of a successful 
campaign in the Persian Gulf would be more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after my first visit to Camp Pendleton, several newspapers across 
the country carried a photograph of a Marine dressed in desert camouflage 
fatigues, suffering from heat exhaustion and being carried off by a buddy. 
</P>
<P>
The picture was taken by a friend who was reporting on the conflict from Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered if my friend, a former Marine, thought he was helping the enemy when 
he took the photograph.

CHARITY BECOMES HABERDASHERY FOR POOR SCHOOL KIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
Her eyes shyly downcast, fourth-grader Claudia Lima wordlessly accepted the 
bright blue backpack -- the first one she had ever owned -- from the worker at 
the Orange County Rescue Mission. 
</P>
<P>
Her demeanor lightened considerably, however, when she was asked how she felt 
about the cache of free school supplies and clothes she carried. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good," she blurted before her mother whisked her away into a crowd of 
other families waiting patiently in the parking lot of the privately funded 
rescue mission. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia and more than 700 other people were on hand Saturday morning to witness 
the beginning of a tradition at the mission, which normally caters to single 
homeless men. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of several local churches, Disneyland and the Newport Beach-based 
Fieldstone Co., the mission launched its first Back to School Clothing and 
Supply Giveaway on West Walnut Street. 
</P>
<P>
For almost three hours, hundreds of impoverished children and parents stood in 
a line that wrapped almost around the brick building for a chance to pick 
through the tables of new and used clothes, boxes of pencils, stacks of 
notebooks and bags of books and crayons. 
</P>
<P>
The items, workers hoped, will help the children be more prepared and less 
awkward in school. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids have never had any new things in their lives," said James 
Palmer, a spokesman for the 27-year-old mission. "A lot of what they are 
wearing are fourth or fifth generation." 
</P>
<P>
Behind Claudia, Margarita Garcia, 36, a native of Tijuana, was combing through 
a pile of socks and shorts for her daughter's size. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of four children, Garcia said she is confined to the house while her 
husband struggles to make ends meet as a truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good for us," she said. "We never have enough money." 
</P>
<P>
Several volunteers who spent the day helping mission workers knew well the 
plight of the poor families who stood in the long line. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was John Wilson, 38, who has been living since January at the 
mission. Wiping sweat from his brow as he tried to keep the table in front of 
him stocked with new clothes, Wilson cheerfully tried to pronounce the few 
Spanish words he knew to direct parents to take just one item of clothes for 
each member of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me great satisfaction to be able to be participating in the ministry 
that Christ had while he was on this earth," said Wilson, who has been 
diagnosed with the virus for acquired immune deficiency syndrome from sharing a 
contaminated needle while a heroin addict. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we all can work together as one, the angels are singing up in 
heaven," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his illness, "this makes me think twice about how fortunate I am," 
Wilson said. "I can be back out on the streets or in a wheelchair. I share in 
their (the children's) feelings, their hunger, their needs." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, mission director John Lands said, using the homeless men who regularly 
stay at the mission to help with the school supply giveaway is a way to build 
much-needed self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have been on the streets," Lands said. "They know what it's like. 
It's not enough to clothe and feed them (the homeless men). They have to be 
changed spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
Lands said he was pleasantly surprised by the larger-than-expected turnout, but 
he regretted that the mission had run out of many items long before all the 
people had filed past the tables. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected 150, 200 people, tops," Lands said. "We can't believe the number 
of people who came out." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Laurie Sargent, 41 -- a secretary for the Fieldstone Co., who donated 
pencils, paper and her time on Saturday -- said she was struck by the poverty 
that she witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing, isn't it?" she asked as she arranged pairs of pants that were 
piled on a folding table. "It's terrible. I didn't realize that there was so 
many people in need."

Mayor Christian W. Keena looked ready to explode in anger as his colleagues, 
council members Robert A. Curtis and Victoria C. Jaffe, heaved verbal daggers 
at each other at a recent meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William S. Craycraft gripped his coffee cup tightly and listened. 
Nearby, Councilman Norman P. Murray just sat and frowned. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 tumultuous months since its incorporation in 1988, South County's 
largest city has witnessed the rancor and animosity that have turned council 
meetings into bitter arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigning as peacemakers, nearly all of the 14 candidates running for three 
council seats in the Nov. 6 election have vowed to bring harmony to council 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, during interviews and at public forums, cleaning up the council's image 
has dwarfed other issues, such as traffic congestion, a failed recall campaign 
last spring against Curtis and an increasing public disaffection with the 
city's sole developer, the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of seeing our council classified as the 'soap opera council' of 
Orange County," said candidate Edward Kearns, a retired Postal Service 
employee. "It's time to stop putting personalities before the politics of 
running the city." 
</P>
<P>
At candidate forums and in mailers being circulated around the city, Kearns and 
several other candidates are taking aim at the council's performance. However, 
while some allege shortcomings in controlling growth and poor handling of city 
finances, the candidates always seem to swing back to the council's behavior in 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer tolerate the anger (among council members) and the political 
maneuvering," candidate Marilyn MacDougall, a trainer for sheriff's deputies, 
said in a recent interview. "It's OK to disagree, just don't make it personal." 
</P>
<P>
"Our City Council has failed," said another candidate, Robert Breton, an 
assistant state attorney general. "They have shown an appalling lack of 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, the lone incumbent seeking reelection (both Jaffe and Keena decided not 
to run again) is trying to stay above the criticism, choosing to emphasize the 
council's efforts to set up a new city government. 
</P>
<P>
"The issues and accomplishments we've achieved . . . (have) directly affected 
the quality of life in Mission Viejo for the better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Craycraft, whose term has not yet expired, warned that taking potshots at the 
current council might backfire with voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the community is fed up with all the uproar and the bashing of the 
council," he said. "I think those who bash the council in their campaigns are 
going to make voters wonder if they would continue that kind of bashing on the 
council." 
</P>
<P>
The field of candidates is as diverse as it is large. Several have served on 
city commissions, and others are leaders in such organizations as homeowners' 
associations or the local board of realtors. Others have led such groups as the 
recently disbanded citizens' committee against the Curtis recall attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"There are at least eight front-runners," Craycraft said. "It's going to be 
very close." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their divergent backgrounds, many of the candidates appear to agree on 
the major issues facing Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all concur that traffic circulation improvements are badly needed and 
that the Mission Viejo Co. should be watched closely on development issues, 
with the planned community nearly built out. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Ray Carolin, a marketing strategist, referred to completion of the 
city's general plan: "We are at a crossroads in Mission Viejo. The Mission 
Viejo Co. is leaving the city in five years, and we will be left to pick up the 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Others decried what they called the council's rubber-stamping of service and 
development agreements left by the county before incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to let the county of Orange decide our future, why did we 
incorporate?" asked candidate Susan Withrow, a Dana Point municipal employee. 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of who wins in November, Craycraft said he is confident that the 
new council will get along better.

BRADLEY'S 4 TOUCHDOWNS LIFT MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conventional wisdom dictates that a team trailing late in the game needs to 
throw to gain chunks of yardage. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom doesn't take into account Moorpark College running back 
Freddie Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark trailed host Santa Monica by a point Saturday night and had the ball 
on its 35 with 2 minutes 57 seconds remaining when Bradley took control of the 
Western State Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley ran up the middle for nine yards, then broke free on the right side for 
48 yards to put Moorpark on the Santa Monica eight. Three plays later, he 
scored on a four-yard touchdown run to give Moorpark a 44-38 win. 
</P>
<P>
Demetrius Wynn intercepted a Jeff Barrett pass to ensure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we got on the field with enough time, we knew we could score or at least 
get in field-goal range," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley finished with 175 yards in 27 carries and scored four touchdowns, 
including a 93-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
"Freddie is in a class by himself," said Will Thurston, Moorpark's offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's performance matched that of Barrett, a former Burroughs High standout 
who threw for 370 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The performances of Bradley and Barrett were not the extent of the offensive 
exploits, though. 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive game, Moorpark quarterback Del Marine's first 
completion of the game was a touchdown pass to his brother Pete. 
</P>
<P>
Del hit Pete with a 44-yard touchdown pass to open second-half scoring and give 
Moorpark (3-0, 2-0 in conference play) a 30-18 lead. Andrew Petroski added the 
conversion kick. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica (2-1, 1-1) battled back with two Barrett touchdown passes in a 
three-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
Del hit Pete again, this time with a 41-yard touchdown pass, to put Moorpark 
back ahead, 37-32, with 6 1/2 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett struck again, on a two-yard quarterback sneak with 2:59 remaining. The 
conversion run failed and Santa Monica led, 38-37, setting the stage for 
Bradley's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Jamal Anderson complemented Bradley with 106 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
As it has in every game this season, Moorpark allowed a score on its first 
defensive series. Barrett hit tight end Jeff Williamson with a short pass on 
Santa Monica's first play from scrimmage, and Williamson broke away from a 
tackle for a 73-yard touchdown.

OCCIDENTAL'S BELTRAN DOWNSHIFTS, TAKES 4TH AT UC RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Marcial Beltran tried a change of pace Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental College cross-country runner took a more relaxed approach while 
running in the UC Riverside Invitational in Riverside and the result was an 
impressive fourth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Beltran, who grabbed the lead midway through the race in the Fresno 
Invitational two weeks ago but faded to ninth, stayed off the pace Saturday 
before moving into a lead pack of eight by the third mile. The group was 
whittled to five by the fourth mile before Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's Scott 
Hempel, UC Riverside's Shannon Winkelman and USC's Mitchell Sloan broke away. 
</P>
<P>
Hempel won the 8,000-meter (4.96 miles) race in 25 minutes 21 seconds, followed 
by Winkelman (25:29) and Sloan (25:31). 
</P>
<P>
Beltran finished in 25:36, four seconds ahead of the Jamal Toads Club's Danny 
Martinez.

"I started in the middle instead of trying to put an all-out effort today and 
win," said Beltran, a junior transfer from Fullerton College who holds the 
national junior college record in the marathon (2:17:26). 
</P>
<P>
"I started to move a little bit at a time and I felt stronger (than at Fresno) 
at the end and didn't burn out. I'm still learning to run a five-mile race (a 
mile longer than a junior college race)." 
</P>
<P>
Emmet Hogan (13th), Jose Garcia (17th), Konstantine Kindreich (30th) and Mike 
Anker (64th) rounded out Occidental's scoring as the Tigers placed fourth with 
128 points in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo won with 69 points, 14 ahead of the Jamal Toads. Arizona State 
was third with 122 and Cal State Fullerton was fifth with 155. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's Laurie Schuster, the defending Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference champion, placed eighth in the women's 5,000-meter race 
(18:23) and teammate Becky Kopchik was 22nd (18:45), helping lift the Tigers to 
fifth place in the women's standings with 233 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go out fast and I was among the top 20 throughout the race," said 
Schuster, "but I was hoping to run in the 17s." 
</P>
<P>
Patti Blunk, competing unattached, won the race in 17:48. Arizona State won the 
team title with 71 points, followed by San Luis Obispo (91), UC Irvine (124) 
and UCLA (156). 
</P>
<P>
Former Valley College standout Gretchen Lohr-Cruz finished 12th in 18:26. 
Northridge held out its top two runners, Darcy Arreola and Derik Vett. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Doering and Martha Segura were Northridge's top finishers, placing 40th 
and 48th, for the eighth-place Matadors. Northridge's Fernando Fernandez 
finished 78th in the men's race as Northridge placed 16th.

Camp Kilpatrick 14, Village Christian 14 -- Camp Kilpatrick kicker Rafael 
Sarabia's extra-point attempt with 26 seconds remaining sailed wide to the 
right in the nonleague game at Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
With Camp Kilpatrick trailing, 14-8, in the fourth quarter, Sarabia launched a 
31-yard pass to Corey Henderson, putting the Mustangs at the Crusader five-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, running back Bobby Wilson slammed into the end zone from a 
yard out to tie the score, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Kilpatrick trailed, 14-0, in the fourth quarter when Sarabia connected 
with Michael Black on a 56-yard touchdown pass with 3 minutes 29 seconds to 
play. The kick attempt was fumbled but Sarabia salvaged a two-point conversion 
with a pass to Kenneth Young. 
</P>
<P>
With Village Christian leading, 7-0, in the first quarter, Rick Nickels 
recovered a fumble by Camp Kilpatrick quarterback Clarence Scranton on the 
Crusader two. Village Christian marched 98 yards in 16 plays and opened a 14-0 
lead on a two-yard pass from Mark Vail to J. B. McLeod. 
</P>
<P>
Vail completed eight of 21 passes for 84 yards and two touchdowns and suffered 
two interceptions. TIM PERERA

Pierce 27, Harbor 12 -- The Pierce offense awoke late in the third quarter with 
a pair of big scoring plays to break open a tight game and post a victory at 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 6-6, Pierce (1-2, 1-1) took the first 7:39 of the second 
half to drive to the Harbor three-yard line but came up empty when it ran out 
of downs. 
</P>
<P>
However, after regaining possession after a punt, Pierce scored on a 56-yard 
run by LaShante Parker that gave the Brahmas the lead for good. Parker finished 
with a game-high 175 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On the final play of the third quarter, Arie McQuaig capped a two-play drive 
with a 68-yard touchdown run to give Pierce a 20-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Jenkins had five catches for 79 yards and one touchdown for Harbor (2-1, 
1-1). 
</P>
<P>
McQuaig had 10 carries for 103 yards for Pierce. NORM WEBER

Marco Arcipreste returned to action Saturday after breaking his index finger on 
his throwing hand in practice two weeks ago, but the Glendale College 
quarterback didn't need to throw much in a Western State Conference game 
against host L. A. Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale tailback Bobby Webster rushed for 128 yards and two touchdowns in 30 
carries, and backs Wes Bender and Rafik Thorossian added 104 and 74 yards, 
respectively, in the Vaqueros' 21-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We did what the coaches felt we needed to do," said Webster, who gained 77 
yards in a loss to Bakersfield last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I started getting yards on little runs so we kept on going to it. It was a 
beautiful victory." 
</P>
<P>
Arcipreste, a sophomore right-hander from Burroughs High who completed four of 
seven passes for 57 yards, was on target when he needed to be. 
</P>
<P>
With Glendale (1-2, 1-1 in conference play) leading, 14-12, early in the fourth 
quarter, Arcipreste orchestrated a nine-play, 58-yard scoring drive, capped by 
a 23-yard pass to Cotie McMahon that accounted for the final score. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale stopped Southwest (1-2, 0-2) on downs on the ensuing series and took 
possession with 7 minutes 42 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale never relinquished the ball again, executing 14 consecutive running 
plays before time expired. 
</P>
<P>
"(Southwest) has a good secondary and (its players) are very tall," Glendale 
Coach John Cicuto said. "We didn't want to pass too much against them and we 
did well on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Southwest's Craig Manigo passed for 154 yards and touchdowns of 23 and 41 yards 
to Robert Avery. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest wasted a scoring opportunity in the first quarter after David Mack 
returned a Glendale punt 49 yards to the Vaquero 35. But Southwest was forced 
to punt after four plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense has struggled," Manigo said. "We had the opportunities, but we 
just couldn't punch it in." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale tied the score, 6-6, when Webster ran 16 yards for a touchdown nine 
minutes before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale went ahead, 14-12, on a four-yard run by Webster late in the second 
quarter. KIRBY LEE

DELAYS TURN FINALE AT SAUGUS INTO AN ENDURANCE CONTEST 
</P>

<P>
If patience really is a virtue, then there were 5,965 virtuous souls at Saugus 
Speedway on Saturday night, where the first of the three much-awaited main 
events of the 1990 Winston/Fall Spectacular was able to squeeze itself in just 
before the 11 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly interminable delays in the B and C main events marred the season's 
final night of racing, but the 50-lap Street Stock oval main event was able to 
get into the books at a reasonable hour. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda's Dave Blankenship, who finished a tight second to Simi Valley's Craig 
Rayburn in the Street Stock points standings, started on the pole and led all 
the way to capture the $1,000 purse. Al Meek of Simi Valley started second and 
finished second. Ed Horst of Reseda was third. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-lap Sportsman main event, which promised to be a wide-open race, 
remained just that: a promise. The frequent use of yellow and red flags during 
preliminary B and C main events delayed most of the night's action, with the 
last race finishing after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sportsman B main, John Watkinson of Canyon Country, Rusty Parr of 
Newhall, John Cran of Reseda and Alton McBride of San Diego finished in the top 
four places to advance to later main events. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Sportsman B main event, Larry Woodside of Saugus was injured when 
his car was struck in Turn 4 of Lap 1. Woodside was able to leave his car under 
his own power but appeared woozy. Race officials said that Woodside was 
complaining of back pain. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-lap B main for Street Stock figure-eight cars had some fireworks when 
Jon Christensen of Lancaster and Mike Branam of Lakeview Terrace were involved 
in a spectacular collision at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Neither driver was hurt, although Christensen had to be restrained by officials 
as he advanced toward Branam. Christensen gestured angrily at Branam before 
both cars were removed from the track.

HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS JUST A SIDELINE FOR MISSION VIEJO'S CLASSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mission Viejo's Kerry Classen may be the best high school athlete in Orange 
County -- he's certainly one of the best conditioned -- but does his name ring 
a bell in your sports subconscious? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not unless you are tuned into triathlons. 
</P>
<P>
Classen is an 18-year-old triathlete who dabbles in cross-country and swimming 
at Mission Viejo High School. Saturday, he was third overall in the boys' 
medium schools seniors race at the Dana Hills Cross-Country Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
How did Classen celebrate his performance? By driving to Carlsbad with a couple 
of other triathletes to do some killer hill repeats on his bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Classen entered his first triathlon as a professional. In 
four races as a pro, he has won $4,400. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, Classen -- who puts all his race earnings into a trust fund 
administered by the U.S. Swimming Federation to retain his amateur status in 
high school -- has been on the triathlon scene since he was 11, when he 
competed in the swimming leg as part of a relay. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he's developed into one of the sport's brightest talents. Last 
month, Classen led a highly competitive triathlon in Sacramento before being 
passed in the final half-mile by Scott Molina, one of the sport's top athletes. 
Classen's second-place finish brought him $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, Ronald and Lois, also triathletes, say Kerry's decision to turn 
pro -- one that eliminated his chance to compete in any NCAA sport in college 
-- was not made on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
"He decided several years ago that this is what he was going to do," Lois 
Classen said. "He started making plans and he's followed through with them. It 
was our goal as parents to keep him low key." 
</P>
<P>
Low key? Classen wakes up at 4:30 a.m., swims with the Mission Viejo Nadadores, 
eats breakfast, goes to school, runs with the cross-country team, then goes 
home to ride his bike . . . presumably all the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to do high school stuff," Classen said. "But obviously triathlons are 
my priority. It's my career." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of paydays, Corona del Mar defensive lineman John McClure blocked a 
kick Friday night against Trabuco Hills, forcing his father, John McClure III, 
to reach for his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
The elder McClure, who often works the chains on the sidelines, gives his son 
$100 for each blocked kick, sack or interception he makes -- with a limit of 
$100 per game. McClure has earned $100 in each of his four games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting killed," said his father, who is a pastor of a church in Newport 
Beach. "Last year, I offered him the same deal, but he only had two sacks. . . 
. I really can't afford this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blurbs you can't live without: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Troy quarterback Greg Windle is described by his father as "an intense 
fly-fisherman." 
</P>
<P>
 -- When he isn't returning kickoffs for touchdowns, as he did last week 
against Trabuco Hills, Julian Johnson of Woodbridge plays the drums, mostly to 
the sounds of heavy metal band Metallica. Sundays, he plays the drums at 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During games, Trabuco Hills' Matt Newbury wears a sneer on his face and a 
large ruby earring in his ear. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Century, a school without a senior class, and Santa Margarita, a school 
with its first senior class, have scheduled homecoming games this year. 
Question: Who's coming home? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michelle Kozlak won the job as Woodbridge Warrior mascot by donning the 
Warrior costume -- 30-pound oversized Indian head -- and dancing to "Singing In 
The Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freshmen Milvia and Alessandra Schinaia, identical twins from Lima, Peru, 
are the Nos. 1 and 2 singles players at Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
What powers their game? "Papa a la Yuancanyana," Alessandra says. "Potatoes 
with spicy sauce." 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said the Tigers would be lucky 
if they won two games this year. After Valencia squeaked by Troy, 47-6, 
Thursday, the Tigers are 4-0, and have outscored their opponents, 150-31. 
</P>
<P>
Can't wait to see that fear in Marrujo's eyes before Valencia's Oct. 18 game 
against Magnolia. (Magnolia fell to Rancho Alamitos, 74-0, last week). 
</P>
<P>
This week's Give Me A Break! Award goes to Donald Ruskin, father of Walter 
Ruskin. Walter played his senior year last year on Huntington Beach High 
School's football team. 
</P>
<P>
Ruskin leased advertising space on three bus stops across from the high school 
to publicize his feelings about Huntington Beach having to forfeit last 
season's Sunset League championship because it used an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
One of the posters reads: "Why were the children punished for adult mistakes? 
Ask Gary Ernst, Huntington Beach principal, and (Southern Section Commissioner) 
Stan Thomas." 
</P>
<P>
At best, this was a waste of $2,500 -- the total price Ruskin paid for all the 
advertising space. 
</P>
<P>
At worst, it's another case of parents gone berserk. 
</P>
<P>
Ruskin, who proudly identified himself as "Psycho Dad," seems intent on not 
letting this matter rest. He has hired an attorney, Eric Parkin, who on Friday 
made a motion to amend the suit filed in U.S. District Court by the Huntington 
Beach parents against the Southern Section last November. 
</P>
<P>
But getting Huntington Beach's league championship back isn't Ruskin's only 
aim. He also wants $10,000 in damages for his son Walter. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because Walter might have been deprived of the college scholarship had he 
gotten to play in the playoffs, Donald Ruskin says. Walter, a freshman at 
Saddleback Community College, is not playing college football.

<P>
BUSINESS IS RETHINKING POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN, BRADLEY INMAN is an Oakland writer specializing in California 
business issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week's U.S. 9th Circuit Court decision to throw out provisions of the 
Proposition 73 campaign reform rules is not expected to open the flood gates 
for business contributions to the political process. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday's court edict wipes out the $5,000 limit on contributions from 
political action committees to an individual candidate and permits PACS such as 
those operated by business firms to make unlimited donations. 
</P>
<P>
But companies aren't necessarily poised to expand their campaign contributions. 
Rethinking their role in state politics for the past couple of years, some 
industries are even cutting political donations to legislative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, United for California, a 20-year-old political action 
committee, folded its operation. Funded by some of the state's largest 
corporations, the PAC gave generously to "pro-business" candidates that often 
challenged incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is frustrated with the legislative gridlock that exists in the state 
capital," said Cynthia Suzuki, political affairs director for the California 
Chamber of Commerce. Business leaders point to this summer's budget impasse as 
an example of what they see as ineptitude in Sacramento. They also complain 
about the lack of action on big issues such as the state's water problems, the 
deteriorating infrastructure and the growing strength of the no-growth 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
But more than anything, "business is tired of being hit up for contributions," 
said Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce. "They see all 
of this money going to pollsters, consultants, lawyers and political gurus, and 
they begin to wonder whether it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
The California Chamber of Commerce's directors recently turned down a staff 
proposal for creating a new PAC that was to make contributions in legislative 
races. Although it has a PAC that funds ballot measures, the chamber has no 
program for making donations to state candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard misconception is that business is pushing money on the 
legislature but, in fact, businesses are being actively solicited for funds all 
of the time and the top executives don't really enjoy it," said Tracy Westen, 
executive director at the California Commission on Campaign Financing, a 
nonpartisan organization that studies state political issues. "Unlike other 
business decisions, they don't know what they are getting for their money and 
they are afraid to ask." 
</P>
<P>
In August, during the last month of the legislative session, 90 fund-raising 
events were held in the state capital, according to an account in the 
California Journal, a Sacramento political magazine. Someone contributing to 
all of these functions would have dished out $44,000 to attend three 
fund-raisers a day. 
</P>
<P>
The federal extortion and racketeering convictions of State Board of 
Equalization member Paul Carpenter and State Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier) 
have also made business executives wary. They fear that they might be dragged 
into a high-profile scandal that could bruise their credibility. 
</P>
<P>
More often, uneasiness with the process has nothing to do with breaches of the 
law. For example, during the fund-raiser spree in August, nearly a 1,000 bills 
were pending before the Assembly and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"The (fund-raising) push comes when the stakes are the highest," Westen said. 
Industry lobbyists "are put in an awkward position and feel queasy about it; 
business is tainted when it gives, but there's still a feeling of being 
disadvantaged if they don't." 
</P>
<P>
There's no statistical evidence that the disillusionment has caused business 
contributions to dry up. From July 1, 1989, to June 30, 1990, the 25 largest 
business-related PACs donated more than $5 million to state campaigns and had 
another $3.7 million in their coffers to be doled out in the next six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The political economy is still very strong in Sacramento," said Ken Mandler, 
publisher of the Capitol Weekly, a publication about state government that 
analyzes political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "many business leaders who have actively contributed in the past 
are saying that the system no longer works," said Al Pross, executive director 
of the California Medical Assn. Political Action Committee, which is the 
state's largest PAC. "Except for the companies that have front-burner issues, 
many large corporations really don't like making contributions anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign reform has forced some big companies to reshape their political 
strategy in Sacramento. Approved by the voters in 1988, Proposition 73's $5,000 
limitation on PACs has weakened the punch that a company has with a single 
candidate, but now large firms and trade associations spread money to more 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, it's not that businesses are turned off by the process, they 
are simply limited by the law," said Pross. 
</P>
<P>
Some business executives argue that Proposition 73 muddied the waters by giving 
politicians other ways of soliciting funds through a myriad of election 
committees and campaign techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"The reform effort has created a maze of regulations and hasn't really reformed 
anything," said Fred Martin, senior vice president at Bank of America. "It 
confuses the public and doesn't force full disclosure of who is soliciting 
funds for what and for whom." 
</P>
<P>
It was easier to track special interests before Proposition 73, according to 
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior associate of the Center for Politics and Policy 
at the Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "we are seeing more individual gifts -- individual lawyers, individual 
Realtors and individual high-level employees making contributions -- but fewer 
conglomerate PAC contributions," said Jeffe. "The money is still there, it's 
just harder to figure out where it's coming from." 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of expensive local and state ballot measures that focus on 
particular issues has also changed how business spends its political resources. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Realtors, for example, has been increasing the size of 
its political war chest that finances issue campaigns such as local and state 
ballot initiatives. This new emphasis is likely to reduce the size of the 
California Real Estate Political Action Committee, which contributes to 
candidates and has been one of the largest and most influential PACs in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, businesses have poured more than $150 million into 
fighting or sponsoring statewide ballot measures on everything from taxes on 
cigarettes to insurance reform. In the November election, the alcohol industry, 
chemical companies and timber interests are expected to raise an additional 
$100 million to fight propositions that would raise the alcohol tax, adopt 
strict rules on air and water pollution, and enact new regulations for timber 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
"Partially to defend (itself), business has decided that the biggest bang for 
the buck is in the initiative process," Jeffe said. "It's a reluctant discovery 
that ballot issues are what's making public policy in this state," she said.

REFINERY ACCIDENT COULD TAKE QUICK TOLL ON LOCAL GAS PRICES, SUPPLIES;

<P>
Would an accident at a Louisiana oil refinery mean higher gasoline prices for 
motorists in Los Angeles? Probably, energy officials say. 
</P>
<P>
With Mideast tensions running high, an unexpected shutdown of even one large 
U.S. refinery within the next few weeks could send prices on already-edgy 
energy markets shooting upward. A refinery accident on the West Coast, which is 
isolated from the vast network of Eastern pipelines and refineries, could have 
a particularly damaging impact on the region, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But unless there's an accident, the gasoline supply situation should improve 
beginning in mid-October. That's when the demand for gasoline, which begins to 
decrease after Labor Day, will have dropped off significantly and stockpiles 
should have built up. In fact, industry statistics show that the nation's 
gasoline stockpiles have increased significantly even since early September and 
that demand has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
But energy officials say U.S. refineries have a very small margin of safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We are about as vulnerable as we can get," said Terry Higgins, assistant 
technical director at the National Petroleum Refiners Assn., an industry trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
A breakdown at a major refinery would be immediately felt in energy markets 
like the New York Mercantile Exchange, and the wholesale price of gasoline 
could rise by 5 cents a gallon within a few days, some industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"It would start on the floor of the (exchange), where reaction would be swift 
and upwards," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group 
Inc. in New Jersey. "We have seen how quickly price increases can get passed 
along." 
</P>
<P>
West Coast refiners usually raise their prices quickly in response to increases 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, a fire in one unit of a Shell Oil Co. refinery in Deer Park, 
Tex., contributed to a sharp run-up on unleaded gasoline futures traded on the 
exchange. It provides a good example of the nervousness of the market because, 
despite the damage, the refinery never reduced production, Shell officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Deer Park refinery is one of 213 U.S. facilities that together produce 
about 11 million barrels of gasoline and other fuels a day, according to August 
figures supplied by the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The total loss of the largest of the huge refineries along the Gulf of Mexico 
would eliminate only 2% to 4% of the nation's ability to refine fuels. However, 
with refineries nationwide running at about 93% of capacity, there is precious 
little room to make up even a small loss. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's ability to produce gasoline will be further constrained in the 
next few weeks as many refineries shut down for scheduled maintenance after the 
summer's peak production period. About 18 refineries were idle in August, and 
that number will grow in the coming weeks, say observers. 
</P>
<P>
Energy officials have kept a wary eye on the nation's gasoline stocks, which at 
one point a few weeks ago were nearly down to the 205 million barrels 
considered as the minimum amount needed to keep the system running without 
interruption. But as of the week ending Sept. 21, gasoline inventories had 
climbed to about 222 million barrels, giving the industry more breathing room 
to cope with a refinery accident. 
</P>
<P>
The chance of having a refinery breakdown increases as refineries run at nearly 
full capacity the world over. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a little larger risk (of a breakdown now) . . . partly because the 
units are being pushed hard," said Robert E. Cunningham, vice president at 
Turner, Mason &amp; Co., a Dallas-based refinery and fuel oil production 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most sophisticated of refineries are prone to breakdowns caused by 
human error or mechanical problems that can idle portions of a plant for a few 
days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, triggering the oil crisis, the 
industry was under fire. Critics blamed oil companies for overworking refinery 
crews, putting off regular maintenance and hiring non-union contract workers 
who, they claimed, receive less safety training than permanent employees. 
</P>
<P>
Although industry officials have disputed such charges, no one denies that 
refinery accidents occur with frequency. "There are fires all the time," said 
Thomas Manning, an oil industry consultant in Houston. But, he added, 
"normally, (fires and accidents) are relatively minor in nature." 
</P>
<P>
And it is true that accidents that have shut down an entire plant have been 
quite rare. "The way the refineries are structured, it's almost inconceivable 
that the entire refinery would go down," said oil industry consultant James 
McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the United States has been able to turn to other parts of the 
world to supplement gasoline inventories. But in recent weeks, Europeans have 
been building up their stores of gasoline to defend against any potential 
shortages or Mideast war. Also, the Europeans are looking for new sources to 
make up for the loss of a giant Kuwaiti refinery that produced about 800,000 
barrels a day of gasoline and other fuels. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, shipments of U.S. refined gasoline have actually been exported to 
Europe recently in a reversal of a traditional pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot today look to Europe to solve our problems because they are awfully 
tight on gasoline as well," Cunningham said. "We don't have the margin of 
safety that we normally have." 
</P>
<P>
Despite tighter gasoline inventories, a serious shortage in this country is not 
likely, say officials. That is especially true east of the Rockies, where a 
vast network of pipelines crisscrosses the nation, making it relatively easy to 
ship supplies where they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
"They can move things around relatively quickly in a few days," Higgins said. 
"If one (refiner) has a problem, he will quickly go to someone else" for 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the giant Gulf Coast refineries are running at 87.9% of capacity 
-- compared to about 93% nationwide -- and have room to boost production to 
make up for losses elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast, however, is a different story. The region is virtually isolated 
from the pipelines that serve the rest of the nation, and West Coast refineries 
are running at about 97% of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, if a major West Coast refinery had to shut down, it could take two 
weeks to a month for additional gasoline and fuel shipments to reach California 
from the eastern part of the country -- via tankers moving through the Panama 
Canal or by tank trucks -- or from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
If Chevron's El Segundo refinery, which produces about 200,000 barrels of 
gasoline daily, were disabled, nearly 10% of the West Coast's refining capacity 
would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty big chunk to take out of the market," said Lewis Blackwell, 
general manager of supply and distribution for Chevron's Western region. 
"Prices would increase pretty significantly." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp, nationwide price increases would be the most dramatic effect of a 
refinery accident on either the East or West coasts. Even in calmer times, 
explosions at major refineries have triggered price hikes in energy markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact (of a closed refinery) might be more visible now because there is 
more tension in the market," said Blackwell at Chevron. "If there is a fire or 
a problem at a refinery that is not going to have a major impact on supply, the 
market may react anyway in the short run in an emotional manner." 
</P>
<P>
But a surge in prices would be temporary as lost capacity is offset from other 
sources and as emotions cool down, industry officials say. "It's worth a nickel 
a gallon for two or three days at wholesale and spot price," said Scott T. 
Jones, president of AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, like other observers, is grateful that the current crunch in refinery 
production did not come in midsummer, when the demand for gasoline is at its 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
"A loss of a capacity come mid-October will not be as big a deal," he said.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: INVESTING IN MUNICIPAL BONDS IS GETTING RISKIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We all know that the economic slowdown and looming recession are adding to the 
risk of such investments as stocks, junk bonds and real estate. Another riskier 
investment to add to that list is tax-free municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
While muni bonds are still considered far safer than stocks and many other 
investments, default rates on munis have been rising sharply, requiring you to 
exercise more care when investing. 
</P>
<P>
If economic problems worsen, holders of riskier issues might see considerable 
declines in prices of their bonds, or defaults. While you seldom lose all your 
money in a default, you can suffer lower or delayed interest payments, or you 
won't get all of your principal back. 
</P>
<P>
The higher default risk stems from several factors. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds issued to finance housing projects are suffering from the nationwide real 
estate slump. Those issued to finance hospitals and other health-care 
facilities are suffering because of rising costs and government-imposed limits 
on reimbursements from medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds issued to fund water and sewer plants, transportation and other 
infrastructure needs -- normally considered among the safest -- are getting 
riskier because states and municipalities are suffering fiscal squeezes. All 
told, budgets of state and local governments combined have gone from a surplus 
in the mid-1980s to the biggest aggregate deficit in over 30 years, says Joel 
M. Vernick, a vice president at David L. Babson &amp; Co., a Cambridge, Mass., 
investment advisory firm. 
</P>
<P>
The softening economy has depressed revenue growth from sales, personal and 
corporate taxes. Also, federal assistance has been sharply reduced, and federal 
mandates have forced increased state and local spending to comply with numerous 
requirements set by Congress, involving such things as Medicaid, water cleanup, 
worker safety and handicapped facilities, Vernick says. Taxpayer revolts have 
compounded the fiscal pressures by limiting tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent evidence of this squeeze can be seen in Philadelphia, which is 
on the brink of insolvency after having difficulties raising money needed to 
cover current cash outlays. By December, the city may be unable to meet its 
payroll, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing in Philadelphia could spread to other cities and 
municipalities," Vernick says. "I'm not predicting a wave of defaults, but I am 
suggesting that investors go in with their eyes wide open." 
</P>
<P>
All told, municipal-bond defaults could total as much as $600 million for the 
first six months of this year, up sharply from $370 million for the same period 
a year ago, says Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond Investors Assn., a 
Miami Lakes, Fla., investor group. Most of these defaults are in housing and 
hospital bonds, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not just confined to higher default risk. Another potential 
problem is that the difference in yield between higher- and lower-rated bonds 
has narrowed -- meaning that investors are not adequately rewarded by getting a 
higher yield on riskier issues, Vernick says. 
</P>
<P>
Why has this "yield spread" narrowed? In part because individual investors have 
become the dominant buyers of munis, either directly or through mutual funds. 
And as it turns out, individuals are more inclined to invest for higher yields 
despite the added risks -- thus driving down yields of the riskier issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Many individuals typically reach for yield and don't do more analysis beyond 
the surface," Vernick says. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals have become the dominant municipal bond investors largely because 
these bonds are one of the few legitimate tax shelters left after the Tax 
Reform Act of 1986. That has spurred greater demand from individuals, while the 
biggest institutional investors -- banks and insurance companies -- have 
reduced their demand because of tax law changes and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
With these added risks, what should you do? 
</P>
<P>
Only buy individual issues if you know what you're doing, can carefully assess 
the risks and have at least $50,000 to $100,000 to invest. That will ensure 
that you can buy enough issues to get adequate diversification and can buy in 
large enough quantities so that you're not eaten up by high brokerage 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a conservative investor and can't afford any losses, stick only to 
bonds that are rated AA or higher. Consider insured bonds, although be aware 
that bond insurance is not an iron-clad guarantee against loss. Lehmann of the 
Bond Investors Assn. suggests avoiding housing and health-care bonds unless 
they are insured. Invest in these and other lower-grade credits only if you 
know what you're doing and understand the risks, Vernick says. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have big bucks to invest, stick to mutual funds. They will give 
you diversification, so that you won't lose your shirt if a few bonds default. 
They also will give you better liquidity -- the ability to sell quickly. And 
you will be relying on professional money managers to sort out the best values.

Q &amp; A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: My wife and I own 600 shares of Trans World Airlines Inc. preferred stock 
that we bought between 1978 and 1982. It has a "call" price of $15 and recently 
has been quite shaky amid a lot of unfavorable rumors about the airline. 
</P>
<P>
We are not strangers to the stock market, nor do we panic easily. However, we 
are apprehensive about this stock. Is the dividend safe? -- Westminster, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Nobody knows what will happen to TWA. The one thing on the side of 
shareholders is that Carl C. Icahn, who owns virtually all the airline's stock, 
has a lot of his own dough invested in this firm. So he's likely to be very 
careful to see that it survives. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has ever said that TWA might simply go out of business. Icahn has said 
that he might shrink it through the sale of assets because he's finding it hard 
to remain competitive. And the TWA unions fighting Icahn -- particularly the 
pilots -- are charging that Icahn is trying to sell pieces of the airline to 
enrich himself. One sale, of the Chicago-to-London routes to American Airlines, 
has been tied up at the Department of Transportation partly because of union 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
On the operational side, TWA wasn't doing particularly well before the recent 
rise in jet fuel prices. And it's not doing any better now. (The whole airline 
industry is experiencing difficult times.) 
</P>
<P>
I asked Icahn recently whether the preferred stock dividend was safe. He dodged 
the direct question, but then went on to say how much cash the company had and 
that, while the airline business was suffering through tough times, TWA was 
making all the right moves by shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Then I asked one of the foremost airline analysts on Wall Street about your 
dividend. "I think the preferred stock is going to be OK," he said, mainly 
because there is plenty of cash and assets backing this company up. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose whether you hold this stock or not will depend on your hearing -- if 
all the noise is going to bother you, you probably should sell. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am very interested in "playing" the stock market, albeit in a small way. 
Could you please advise me on what steps I should follow? I plan to limit my 
initial investment to $100. Can I eliminate the need for a broker? -- Glendale 
</P>
<P>
A: It's hard to "play" anything nowadays with just $100, much less invest in 
the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
What you should do is find a "no-load" -- meaning, no fee -- stock mutual fund 
that permits people to invest as little as $100. This is a conservative way to 
get started, but you will be "playing" the market. Your library should have 
books that list all the mutual funds in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Or, you could buy a few shares of a blue chip company. But a good deal of your 
money will get eaten up by the brokerage commission. If you use a discount 
brokerage firm, you can reduce the sales fee. 
</P>
<P>
I've asked the American Assn. of Individual Investors in Chicago to send you 
some literature aimed at helping beginners understand the stock market. You 
will be receiving a book called "A Lifetime Strategy for Investing in Common 
Stocks." 
</P>
<P>
Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have two certificates of deposit in two different banks. They are each set 
up as revocable trusts for two nieces. 
</P>
<P>
The government has changed the way it insures these trusts. The new rules are 
complex. I wrote to my banks but got no answer. I also wrote the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., but it didn't answer either. 
</P>
<P>
So I am writing to you. Can you find out if my revocable trusts for my nieces 
are OK and if the FDIC will pay the insurance if the bank goes broke? -- 
Brawley 
</P>
<P>
A: It took the FDIC a couple of days, but they finally figured this one out. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Rollin, a senior attorney with the FDIC, says that all of your accounts 
together (that is, added up) are insured for a total of up to $100,000 in each 
of the banks. 
</P>
<P>
So if you have $100,000 in an account in your name and another $100,000 in a 
trust for one niece at the same bank, only $100,000 of your money is insured. 
If the bank closed, you'd be out the other $100,000. The same is true for the 
second niece at the second bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the circumstances would be different if the trusts -- actually called 
"testamentary accounts" -- were in your name, plus that of a spouse, child, 
stepchild, adopted child or grandchild, instead of a niece. In the other cases, 
each trust account by itself would be insured for up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, your personal account would be insured for $100,000, and the 
trust account with child, stepchild, etc., would be covered by another $100,000 
in insurance. If the bank goes out of business, you'd get all your $200,000 
back. 
</P>
<P>
If your accounts exceed the $100,000 limit because of the money placed in trust 
for your nieces, you should simply move the excess funds to another bank. Then 
all of your money would be insured. JOHN CRUDELE

TIPS ON HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
RECYCLING: THERE'S A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT TO GETTING RID OF CAR BATTERIES, MOTOR 
OIL, PAINT AND OTHER TROUBLESOME HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many recycling centers do not accept hazardous wastes commonly found around the 
home, such as car batteries, paints and oven cleaners. But with a little extra 
effort, those products can be recycled too -- or at least disposed of properly. 
</P>
<P>
Several government agencies hold periodic hazardous waste roundups, where 
household wastes of all types are collected for free. The County Sanitation 
Districts has tentatively scheduled its next roundup Oct. 20 at Hollywood Park 
in Inglewood. For information, call (213) 908-4286. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles also sponsors municipal roundups, although none is scheduled. To 
get on the city's mailing list for announcements about upcoming collections, 
call (213) 237-1634. Contact your local city government for information about 
roundups in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers of "The Recycler's Handbook: Simple Things You Can Do," 
scheduled to be in bookstores Nov. 15, make suggestions about how best to 
handle household wastes that are difficult to recycle. The book is available by 
sending $4.95 plus tax and a $1 shipping fee to the EarthWorks Group, 1400 
Shattuck Ave., 25, Berkeley, Calif. 94709, or by calling (415) 841-5866. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
* BATTERIES. If a service station changes your battery, check to make sure it 
will be recycled. If you replace your own battery, buy the new one from a 
retailer who will recycle the old one. If you cannot find someone to recycle an 
old battery, take it to a hazardous waste facility or to a hazardous waste 
roundup. Do not store old batteries for any length of time in your garage or 
house. 
</P>
<P>
* MOTOR OIL. If a gas station changes your oil, check to make sure it will be 
recycled. If not, take your car elsewhere. If you change your own oil, store it 
in a screw-cap container that will not leak, such as a plastic milk jug, or use 
a recycling kit available in hardware and automotive stores. Avoid spilling oil 
on the ground, where it will leak into ground water or wash into storm drains 
-- and eventually go into the ocean. Take old oil to collection sites at gas 
stations and garages or to a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* PAINT. If old latex paints still look fresh, mix them together and use them 
as a primer. Some communities have paint exchange programs, where people bring 
reusable paint to trade or give away. Check with your city government. Unusable 
paint should be disposed of at a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* PAINT THINNER. Put used thinner in a jar. After it settles, reuse the clean 
thinner on top and let the sediment sink to the bottom. When enough sediment 
accumulates, dispose of it at a hazardous waste facility or roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS. The EPA estimates that 25% of hazardous wastes comes from 
homes. The culprits include lighter fluid, pesticides, furniture polish, nail 
polish, nail polish remover, drain openers, scouring powders, oven and toilet 
bowl cleaners, caulk, mothballs and adhesives. Give unneeded products to 
neighbors or friends who could use them or properly store and label them for 
future use. Otherwise, take them to a hazardous waste facility or roundup.

RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY (FROM N-Z) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those bottles, old oil cans, magazines and newspapers that have been building 
up in your garage are recyclable; maybe even valuable. This is the second part 
of a list provided by the state Integrated Waste Management Board of San 
Fernando Valley recycling centers that accept an array of disposable products. 
Some centers pay for the materials. The board has a toll-free hotline for 
recycling information: (800) 553-2962. The line is often busy and does not 
provide information about prices paid for recylables. Local centers -- with 
phone numbers listed below -- provide that information. The following list is 
distinct from another previously published in The Times, which featured centers 
certified by the state to pay for beverage containers. For more information 
about those centers, call the Department of Conservation's toll-free number, 
(800) 327-9886.

RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY (FROM A-N) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those bottles, old oil cans, magazines and newspapers that have been building 
up in your garage are recyclable; maybe even valuable. The state Integrated 
Waste Management Board has released a list of San Fernando Valley recycling 
centers that accept an array of disposable products. 
</P>
<P>
Some centers pay for the materials. The board has a toll-free hotline for 
recycling information: (800) 553-2962. The line is often busy and does not 
provide information about prices paid for recylables. Local centers -- with 
phone numbers listed below -- provide that information. The following list is 
distinct from another previously published in The Times, which featured centers 
certified by the state to pay for beverage containers. For more information 
about those centers, call the Department of Conservation's toll-free number, 
(800) 327-9886.

WOODEN BOWLS on the order of the William Hunter creation shown at left will 
probably never hold lettuce and vinaigrette. Although most turned-wood vessels 
are made with at least a suggestion of a bowl shape, some look like graceful 
filigree while others are braided, stretched, furrowed, fluted, looped or even 
tied. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Edward Jacobson's extraordinary collection of these turned-wood bowls 
was the subject of awed reviews during its recent three-year 
Smithsonian-sponsored international tour; Jacobson recently donated all the 
pieces to Arizona State University at Tempe's Fine Arts Museum. Now, in 
"Contemporary Masters, Current Work by Artists of the Jacobson Collection," 
more than 60 new works by 18 of the artists represented in Jacobson's group are 
on display at del Mano Gallery &amp; Studio (through Oct. 27). Prices range 
from about $500 to more than $10,000.

IT'S THE MARMALADE that's kept the Ward ranch going for nearly 100 years. 
Located in Sierra Madre, the Ward Ranch is a slice of country hidden away in 
the midst of a bustling city. 
</P>
<P>
From the dirt driveway, you can catch a glimpse of an authentic old red barn 
flanked by orange groves. The old-fashioned store represents the 
four-generations-old family business: marmalade. 
</P>
<P>
All the cooking is done on-site, and although "some companies use corn syrup," 
says E. Waldo Ward Jr., "we use only sugar." Orange marmalade ($2.55 for a 
10-ounce jar) is the ranch specialty, but for the adventurous palate, there's 
ginger marmalade, port-wine jelly, guava jam and kiwi preserves as well as such 
condiments as seafood sauce, chili sauce and zucchini relish. Tours are 
conducted by appointment.

THE SIGN OUT FRONT is the first and best clue to what you'll find inside 
Pasadena's Starlight Roof -- Classic American Music and Video: "Sorry, we do 
not sell rock 'n' roll, rap, heavy metal . . . no X-rated, no truck-crashing. 
We do sell big bands, shows and sound tracks and all the great films of 
Hollywood's Golden Era." Walking into Starlight Roof is like venturing back to 
an earlier time -- a past you can return to when you get home after purchasing 
audio cassettes, CDs and videotapes. Small but well-stocked, Starlight Roof is 
a cinephile's dream, a pre-rock 'n' roll haven. 
</P>
<P>
Why are no slasher movies represented? No head-banging music? "Essentially, 
it's what I like, with some variation," says owner John Cooper, who opened 
Starlight Roof in 1988 after 20 years in music and video retailing. "I stock 
things that I don't object to. I started with music, then branched into films." 
</P>
<P>
There is a strong musical mix: audio cassettes include works of such celebrated 
entertainers as Louis Prima, Carmen Miranda, Louis Armstrong and Harry James. 
The video selection is divided into such subdrama categories as "Women in 
Love," "Women in Danger," "Women in General" and the catchall "Politics, Social 
Issues, Men vs. Women, Whatever's Left." A small sampling: the 1925 "Wizard of 
Oz," with Oliver Hardy, and classic films ranging from the early silents 
through '50s camp, including a number of hard-to-find B movies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of younger people come in who appreciate older movies and tapes," says 
Cooper, who enjoys sharing his knowledge with a new generation. "That's great; 
they get a whole new slant on listening to music or watching films." 
</P>
<P>
So a trip to Starlight Roof may be just the thing the next time you're faced 
with the 73rd sequel to "Friday the 13th." Prices range from $9.95 for Orson 
Welles' "The Third Man" to $59.98 for "Pete Kelly's Blues," a musical starring 
strait-laced "Dragnet" cop Jack Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 Starlight Roof -- Classic American Music and Video, 641 E. Colorado Blvd., 
Pasadena; (818) 568-2945.

AN INSIDE LOOK

Both Prime Ticket announcers for the Kings believe this could be a great season 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that this is a put up or shut up year," said Jim 
Fox, a former Kings right wing who is beginning his first season as an analyst. 
"This is their third year with Wayne (Gretzky), so we're going to have to see 
if they play up to their potential. 
</P>
<P>
"With Wayne and the people they've brought in around him, the potential exists 
to go all the way, there's no doubt about that. The big word everybody throws 
around is chemistry, but in this instance it's right on the nose. If they can 
find the proper chemistry, I think they can be battling with the best teams in 
the league." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Tom Webster is promising a more defense-oriented approach this season. 
Last season the Kings allowed 337 goals, fourth most in the league, while 
falling to fourth place in the Smythe Division and 15th overall among the 21 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is going to be if this team can play as well defensively as Tom 
Webster wants them to play," said play-by-play announcer Bob Miller. "I've 
heard for 17 years that we have to cut down on the goals against, and for most 
of the 17 years, it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
Both announcers consider the Edmonton Oilers, defending Stanley Cup champs, the 
team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I give Edmonton all the credit in the world," Miller said. "I don't know of 
any other team that could have traded a player of Wayne Gretzky's stature and 
win the Stanley Cup again two seasons later," Miller said. "That's a tremendous 
feather in the hat of the management of that team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just unbelieveable that they came back and played as well as they did and 
won the Stanley Cup. Of course, they'll miss Jari Kurri (the all-star right 
wing who signed to play with a team in Italy) but they still have a great 
nucleus of players up there.STEVEN HERBERT

WHAT IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD A THRIFT SALE AND NOBODY WAS INTERESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Resolution Trust Corp. is going to have a tougher time unloading its 
inventory of failed thrifts as the financial services industry suffers 
ever-increasing trauma, industry experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be more and more cases where they (RTC officials) throw a 
party and nobody comes," one investment banker said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's resolution of two big savings and loans reflects the federal 
clearinghouse's tougher job. RTC received just three bids for the 24 offices 
and deposits of Mercury Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. In Huntington Beach, 
which went to Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles. And RTC was forced to 
carve up one of its biggest wards, City Savings Bank in Somerset, N.J., rather 
than sell it outright. 
</P>
<P>
The agency sold City's 27 Florida branches to Great Western Bank in Beverly 
Hills and nine offices in Camden, N.J., to First Fidelity Bank in Burlington, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
But the RTC was forced to retain 66 City branches with $8.2 billion in assets. 
It got just five bids for any of the possible combinations of the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
In a deal not yet announced, Bank of America is expected to win MeraBank in 
Phoenix for a relatively skimpy premium of 3% to 4% on deposits. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the potential buyers (for RTC thrifts) have their own problems," said 
Henry Peltz, savings and loan analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. "With 
the continuing bad press on the savings and loan industry and uncertainty in 
the real estate markets, nobody wants to buy these savings and loans." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, sources say Chase Manhattan Corp. in New York took a look at City. But 
with the announcement last week of a projected $625-million loss for the third 
quarter at the nation's second-largest bank, Chase is not likely to buy any RTC 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many fewer buyers than a year ago," said John Lyons, president of 
Lyons, Zomback &amp; Ostrowski, a New York consulting firm. "You can pretty 
much remove all the New York money-center banks from the roster." 
</P>
<P>
The three big California banks -- BankAmerica Corp., Security Pacific and Wells 
Fargo and Co. -- have been aggressive buyers. But even they may become less 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"You have got to ask yourself, how big is the appetite?" said Terry E. Perucca, 
Security Pacific's senior vice president of corporate planning and acquisition. 
"How many more (RTC thrifts) will Security, Wells and B of A buy?" 
</P>
<P>
B of A has picked up Merabank and Western Savings &amp; Loan Assn., also in 
Phoenix, and Benjamin Franklin Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific has bought Gibraltar Savings and Mercury. Wells Fargo is 
buying most of the operations of ailing Great American Bank, although the San 
Diego thrift has not yet come under the wing of the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of bidders was also reflected in the premiums for Mercury and City, 
which were not high. Great Western paid $9.75 million for $938 million of core 
deposits, according to RTC calculations. Combined with the $9.1 million First 
Fidelity paid for $468 million in City deposits, the total premium is about 
1.5% of core deposits, according to the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific paid $44.4 million for $985 million in core deposits for a 
premium of about 4.5% of core deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts and bankers expected Mercury to fetch more because of an 
attractive branch network and 110,000 customers, mostly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The prices keep coming down," said Lyons, the consultant. "Most of the 
premiums are running under 1%. There are a few exceptions to that on the West 
Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Peltz of Keefe said the average premium the RTC received for the 237 thrift 
resolutions it completed through August was 2.12%.
