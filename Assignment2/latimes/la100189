WIDOWS AT THE WHEEL;

THE WIDOWS' ADVENTURES BY CHARLES DICKINSON (WILLIAM MORROW: $18.95; 388 PP.)

and Other Stories.

Beauty, let's face it, is there or it's not, but adventure is in the eye of the 
beholder. Nancy Mairs, a poet and essayist whose multiple sclerosis makes it 
uncertain on any given day that she will travel far from her bed, wrote in 
"Plaintext": "I have a low adventure threshold. . . . Everything that crosses 
it may be an adventure, and thus (I) may be inundated and swept away by the 
events of a life that seems to others as still as a stagnant pond. Think about 
a drop of water from that pond under a microscope, however: the adventurous 
life." 
</P>
<P>
The elderly protagonists of Charles Dickinson's third novel, "The Widows' 
Adventures," are likewise swept along by daily events and non-events in their 
Chicago suburb. Ina and her sister, Helene, have lived out their 70-plus years 
in the space of a few city blocks, in relative contentment, but now as the 
neighborhood goes to seed they're held hostage to an unsympathetic decade. 
Dangerous-looking boys cut through their yards on the way to the river to cache 
beer; a fat burglar gets stuck trying to enter Ina's house through the 
milk-box. For Helene, who is constrained by diabetes, getting to the grocery 
store and back in one piece is a matter of high drama. 
</P>
<P>
But Ina lusts for more. She talks Helene into making a pilgrimage across the 
country to visit Ina's children in California. They will go by car. This is no 
stagnant-pond adventure; Ina can't drive, and Helene, who finally consents to 
do so, is stone-blind. 
</P>
<P>
The magic Dickinson works in this painful, hilarious adventure story is 
twofold: First, he gives heart and life to characters whom the rest of the 
world would probably not notice, were they to stand for half a day or so on a 
street corner in Chicago or even Des Moines. From the outside they're as 
invisible as the microbes in pond water, but on the inside they glow with 
passions, bright blue and dangerous, that jump back and forth between them like 
arcing electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters miss being energetic and pretty enough to flirt, and they miss 
being married. Ina, in particular, misses sex. Helene has locked away secrets 
of an abusive marriage that even her sister doesn't suspect. Ina steadily 
drinks beer and wonders at the love of her husband, who never asked her to 
stop. The widows speak to each other in the caustic, funny shorthand that's 
unique to siblings and very old friends. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson's second miracle is that he makes their journey not only captivating 
but entirely plausible. Ina gives careful directions, and Helene is a pro at 
the wheel, but there's more to the credibility formula than that. The 
novelist's principal task is to make us throw aside our dust mops or squash 
racquets or what have you and sit rapt for several hours while we stake our 
hearts on a lie. Ursula K. Le Guin has pointed out that while fiction writers 
in their braver moments do desire the truth, they go about telling it in a 
peculiar and devious way, "inventing persons, places, and events which never 
did and never will exist . . . and then when they are done writing down this 
pack of lies, they say, There! That's the truth!" 
</P>
<P>
And if it works, we believe. It's not a matter of finding stories that simulate 
truth (for what -- I recently asked a roomful of writing students, as I waved 
an article about a man who piloted a plane 2,000 miles while unconscious, then 
crashed into the sea, then swam to safety -- what could be more implausible 
than a true story?). The trick is to construct a story readers will want to 
believe, with all their hearts, and to play it out in a world so detailed and 
appealing that they're prepared to pack their bags and move in. When Ina and 
Helene set out at 2 a.m. for California, at the speed of 12 m.p.h., I was 
already in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
Their trip is much more than an adventure about stop signs and avoiding head-on 
collisions, though these perils keep the narrative lively. The scene in which 
they talk their way out of a citation, after a minor accident, is somehow 
reminiscent of Gracie Allen, George Burns, and Cheech and Chong. 
</P>
<P>
But the real journey is quieter than this. During the long night hours on the 
road (they eventually risk a breathtaking 40 m.p.h.) the sisters' conversations 
reveal the complex interdependencies that grow out of a lifetime of love. Life 
is ponderously loaded with both good luck and bad, and pain can accumulate 
astonishingly if you live long enough, but both these women are still hell-bent 
on seeing what will happen tomorrow. While their children advise, ignore, and 
murderously irritate, Ina and Helene want nothing more than to take their lives 
in their own hands. Alone, they can't quite manage, but as a team they are 
capable of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
"The Widows' Adventures" is that most wonderful, and increasingly rare, sort of 
novel written by an author who loves his characters beyond measure. The result 
is compelling. Gabriel Garcia Marquez once made me believe that a beautiful 
child could rise into the sky on a freshly laundered sheet, and now Charles 
Dickinson has convinced me that a blind woman can steer a Pontiac Omega across 
the United States. And that I'd better throw down my dust mop and go along, 
because it's going to be worth the trip.

I am writing regarding the KABC-TV story covering the Cleland House Community 
Center in East Los Angeles, which appeared on the station's 6 p.m. news on 
Sept. 12. Too many times the Mexican-American community receives attention from 
the media only when there are negative or sensational stories to report. I 
appreciate and applaud the decision to highlight the positive programs, 
activities, staff and clients at Cleland House.

Like many other viewers, I am hungry for Westerns. So I can't tell you how much 
I enjoyed Hugh O'Brian and Gene Barry in the season premiere of "Paradise." It 
was great to see them back in the saddle. The only problem is that "Paradise" 
is such a bad program. What is the target audience? Is it adults or children? 
The plot was too silly for adults and some of the content was too racy for 
kids. The program is well-intended and well-acted, but those stories! Pew. 
Also, NBC should make that perfectly acceptable and entertaining program 
"Desperado" a series. My family and I would like that just fine!

FICTION IN BRIEF: FALLING OUT OF TIME BY O.R. MELLING (VIKING: $18.95; 256 PP.)

Multi-levels of reality, numbered fragments of text, intermixing of illusion 
and fact and characters jumping in and out of their fictional worlds are all 
part of O.R. Melling's agenda of postmodernist writing. The author's gift is in 
granting ordinary events extraordinary causes, cloaking them with the potent 
poetic license of mysticism. The book runs charmingly true to course, but for 
one liberty, justified by the modern setting: Her characters' drug use makes 
the fantastic elements palatable -- indeed, who would not believe in the 
manipulations of gods and influence of faeries in a feverish opium dream? 
</P>
<P>
Two gods meet and declare a new cycle of love: "Two rooms that are one. . . . 
Two beds that are a single note of multiplicity." Michael, a musician, and 
Raffie, a philosophy student, are Dublin lovers. The outcome is foretold -- 
that love is transient and passion will always exhaust itself in strife and 
separation. Actually, their story is merely the manuscript of a writer at an 
artists' retreat in Ireland, hoping to mythologize her failed marriage on the 
page and thereby gain release from it. But as storytellers have always 
maintained, characters have a way of walking off with their own conclusions. 
The confrontation between the narrator and Raffie over the ending of this and 
all love affairs is the fluid, final unweaving of the fictional lie. 
</P>
<P>
Melling's first adult work (her last work, "The Singing Stone," is a children's 
book) is a brave melding of insight and madness. It is easy to judge this as an 
immature work, yet it is a supple one that starts in and out of convention with 
fey grace and more than a few sassy tricks. -- Kimberly Olson Fakih

FICTION IN BRIEF: THE BEST OF INTENTIONS: AND OTHER STORIES BY ARTIE SHAW (JOHN

Artie Shaw, the renowned Swing Era clarinetist, has long had an interest in 
writing. Even during his first musical successes in the mid-'30s, he was 
attracted to writing as a private endeavor that could present an alternative -- 
and possibly even a lucrative one -- to the life of celebrity he found 
increasingly oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
So he wrote, and continues to write. "The Best of Intentions" is Shaw's third 
book, following the 1952 autobiography, "The Trouble With Cinderella," and the 
1965 novel, "I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead." "Intentions," while sometimes 
off the mark, definitely lands on target a good deal of the time, delivering 
its fair share of pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
At their best, these five short pieces and a novella -- which take place 
anywhere from the 1930s to the mid-'60s, but were all written since 1950 -- 
bristle with life, render his characters' dialects faithfully, and pack 
unexpected punches. 
</P>
<P>
In "Snow White in Harlem, 1930," he flavorfully depicts a white saxophonist's 
trek to the northern end of Manhattan in search of a jam session. And in "The 
Fabulous Courtship of Joe Kubak," he carefully and delightfully lays out a 
fantasy held by most people who have become enamored with a motion picture 
star. 
</P>
<P>
The book's most powerful moments come from the novella, "The Best of 
Intentions," a sometimes gripping work that details a magazine editor's 
reaction to a mugging. Forced to surrender a gold watch given to him by his 
father, the editor arranges with the mugger, an unusually benevolent fellow for 
this line of work, to exchange the watch for cash. This exchange, which takes 
place later at a mid-Manhattan bar, has surprising consequences for both 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the stories drag; notably, "A Nice Little Post-War Business," an 
ultimately silly sketch of two musicians on deck of a Navy ship in the Pacific 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shaw has come up with some good stuff here; this reader hopes it won't 
be the last we hear from him. Zan Stewart

FICTION IN BRIEF: OBSCENE GESTURES FOR WOMEN BY JANET KAUFFMAN (KNOPF: $16.95;

Janet Kauffman's short stories pose overtly feminist questions in a thoroughly 
undogmatic way. Men are not the enemy. Her women live happily with gentle 
companions. But the women discover that they are strangers in the world, 
disenfranchised by the masculinity of the forms of expression -- the gestures 
of the title. The opening story, a surrealistic fantasy, sets the scene: A man 
accidentally comes upon a flock of woman-birds in a field. They seem to be 
creatures he has never seen before, but he recognizes that they are women 
acting is a way no man has ever observed. The voices in the stories that follow 
could be the individuals in this exotic flock. 
</P>
<P>
Marimba, the narrator in the title story, has perfect teeth. Her pleasure in 
their appearance collapses, however, when she discovers that the smoothness of 
their beveled edges comes from her habit of grinding her teeth in her sleep. 
For years she had prided herself on her firm jaw muscles: "In her ignorance, 
she thought when she looked in the mirror: this is how a woman's face matures." 
When she takes her newly-discovered troubles to a hypnotherapist -- male, of 
course -- he instructs her to "display hostility rather than self-inflict it. . 
. . You don't know how many men go around, surreptitiously giving their bosses 
the finger." Here Marimba rebels; she can't "give the finger." A new vocabulary 
of obscene gestures is needed for women, she argues: "Couldn't he see that 
physiologically, women do not screw the world? I said, Give me an obscene 
gesture for women, and sure, I'd use it." Sonja Bolle

REAGAN'S MAN AT THE ARMS CONTROL TABLETHE GREAT UNIVERSAL EMBRACE ARMS 
SUMMITRY: A SKEPTIC'S ACCOUNT BY KENNETH L. ADELMAN (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: 
$19.95; 368 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard H. Ullman, Ullman, the David K. E. Bruce Professor of International 
Affairs at Princeton University, writes frequently on American foreign and 
defense policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During much of Ronald Reagan's presidency Americans were treated to the 
spectacle of appointees to high office speaking and acting as if they wished to 
emasculate or even abolish the departments of government they had ostensibly 
been hired to run. Education, Interior, Environmental Protection, Health and 
Human Services, a host of regulatory agencies -- all at one time or another 
were led by persons for whom lifting the weight of their own organization from 
the backs of the governed was a mission akin to a religious calling. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman came to the Arms Control Disarmament Agency after polishing his 
ideological credentials as deputy to Jeane Kirkpatrick, the U.S. representative 
to the United Nations. He replaced Eugene Rostow, the crusty former Yale Law 
dean and founding member of the Committee on the Present Danger, who was fired 
when Reagan's inner circle began to fear that he was too willing to strike a 
deal with Moscow. (Those were the days when the Kremlin was still the center of 
the "Evil Empire.") 
</P>
<P>
Adelman, 36, saw it as his mission to save Reagan from the "arms controllers." 
He writes: "No arms control deal can prevent nuclear devastation, reduce the 
risk of war much, if at all, save money, or increase U.S. security, again much, 
if at all." Arms control, he continues, "could easily hurt but cannot easily 
help the nation; it is something to view more often with trepidation than 
anticipation." 
</P>
<P>
Although Adelman underlines Soviet statements, going back to Lenin, lauding 
disarmament as sand in the face of the capitalist enemy, he does not join his 
ideological friends who argue that success in negotiations with the Russians 
will lull the West into a false sense of security and therefore into lowering 
its guard. Quite the contrary. "It is hard to imagine the country being lulled 
when conservatives keep sounding alarm bells about the perils of being lulled," 
he says. And the guard stays up: "No major American weapons system has been 
stopped or seriously constrained by the terms of an arms agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Here, indeed, is one root of Adelman's skepticism about the utility of 
negotiated arms control. Agreements thus far have tended to curb only weapons 
the two superpowers have not valued highly, and both have rushed to compensate 
for reductions by building more of those weapons not covered by agreements. "No 
area of science, medicine, or even public policy would continue to elicit so 
much hope after so many years of unsuccessful effort," he writes. "Arms control 
must be approached as one of the intangibles of life, a rite seemingly needed 
to satisfy some deep longing in our collective soul." (His book takes its title 
from a fabled disarmament conference among the animals in which each beast 
proposed abolishing those weapons upon which its predators most relied until at 
last the bear arose and said: "Comrades, let us abolish everything -- 
everything but the great universal embrace.") 
</P>
<P>
Like some liberals these days, Adelman prefers reciprocal unilateral steps to 
negotiated formal agreements. One side independently would eliminate a certain 
number of deployed weapons or suspend production in one category, and then look 
around to see what the other does in response. That would eliminate the 
paranoid scratching for marginal advantage that often characterizes 
negotiations. An example, at least in principle, is Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev's announcement late last year that by 1991 his country would reduce 
its armed forces by half a million men, and eliminate a number of tanks and 
artillery pieces, the weapons the West fears most, from positions facing NATO 
forces. If he follows through with those reductions he can then reasonably 
expect a comparable gesture from the West. If no such reciprocal move is 
forthcoming he will be able to draw appropriate conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Where Adelman parts company with liberals is in his unswerving support of 
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and his refusal to acknowledge that 
a U.S. capability to destroy some incoming Soviet missiles might raise the 
risks of war in a future crisis by spurring the Soviets to launch first, rather 
than sit back and allow us to destroy a portion of their missiles in their 
silos and then use our defenses to pick off most of those missiles they do 
succeed in launching. He also fails to recognize that the very aspects of arms 
control that he dismisses as ritualistic have had real value in inducing 
Washington and Moscow to use their military relationship as a channel of 
communication when their disagreements left them unable effectively to talk 
about any of the other issues dividing them. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman's book is schizophrenic about the Soviet Union. Its acknowledgement of 
the profound changes under Gorbachev is grudging in the extreme, and tempered 
by repeated recitations of all the international mischief that Moscow is 
allegedly still working. That is not surprising: The pace of change in the 
U.S.S.R. over the last year has been so rapid as to catch off balance any 
author -- especially one who, like Adelman, takes such pains in so many 
passages to establish his true-blue conservative coloration. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting parts of Adelman's book are not his provocative arguments 
about arms control or his lucid and objective explanations of nuclear doctrine, 
but his accounts of bureaucratic warfare over arms control within the 
government in Washington, and his vivid narratives of the three 
Reagan-Gorbachev meetings in which he participated. Especially good is his 
description of the frantic, unscripted Reykjavik summit of October, 1986, in 
which the two presidents, negotiating without aides, appeared to be on the 
verge of a deal for eliminating nuclear ballistic missiles. His aim, he says, 
was not to write a kiss-and-tell memoir, but his portraits of Reagan and his 
principal lieutenants, especially Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary 
of Defense Caspar Weinberger and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, pull 
no punches. And although he avows great affection for Reagan, in his pages the 
President comes across as a genial stopped clock, right twice a day, but in 
Reagan's case, Adelman argues, right when it counted. (The most memorable scene 
-- Reagan's John Wayne-like remark to a television set showing Gorbachev's 
arrival in Reykjavik: "When you stop trying to take over the world, then maybe 
we can do some business.") 
</P>
<P>
Adelman's book is marred by a patronizing, snide tone. The State Department, he 
notes in a typical passage, fought one of his proposals "with an intensity 
rarely displayed in its dealing with the Soviets or others around the world." 
And just in case a reader does not fully grasp his point, he coyly adds a 
parenthesis: "(State's 'diplomatic entrance' features a flower garden filled 
with pansies and bleeding hearts.)" 
</P>
<P>
The horticultural note suits Adelman's purpose, but it happens not to be true. 
So, alas, do many other things he says. I cannot recall a book with more 
factual errors. Most are minor -- names misspelled, numbers or dates wrong. But 
many are serious. The Soviets, he writes, "now station more troops (in East 
Germany) than exist in the entire United States Army." Wrong: The 1988 numbers 
were 380,000 and 760,000, respectively. Evgeny Velikhov, the Soviet physicist, 
is a "two-timer who manages their SDI program and castigates our SDI program on 
the U.S. lecture circuit." Wrong: Velikhov has worked on lasers but plays no 
significant role in the Soviet anti-missile program. The Soviets lead the 
United States "on (SDI-related) ground-based lasers, particle beams, and 
terminal defense." Wrong: Most experts say the United States leads in all these 
fields. There are other incorrect statements. Many others are misleading. Some 
seem designedly so. And the book is singularly devoid of references. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman's glib, reckless writing will put off many readers. That is 
regrettable, because his book is a significant contribution to recent history. 
And its arguments deserve to be pondered.

THE BOOK TRADE: AMERICANS LOVE PULP FICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

In the ongoing debate over who reads what, if anything, a new study from the 
National Endowment for the Arts has shown that a majority of Americans do read 
fiction. The report, with the catchy, government-approved title of "Who Reads 
Literature?: Survey Data on the Reading of Fiction, Poetry, Drama by U.S. 
Adults During the 1980s," found that 56% of American adults read at least one 
work of fiction, poetry or drama in the course of a year. But before the 
nation's high school teachers rush out and pat themselves on the backs for 
instilling a love of Dante, Milton, Melville or Dostoevsky, it should be noted 
that most of the "literature" read by Americans turns out to be genre fiction. 
Thrillers, romances and science fiction top the list, with just 10% to 25% of 
the population admitting to reading in one year any work of what is deemed 
"quality" fiction. Even fewer adults, just 7% to 12%, said they read novels, 
poems, stories or plays by "serious" writers, modern-day or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Working with data from two surveys conducted by the Arts Related Trend Study 
and another by the Book Industry Study Group, the endowment also concluded that 
readership among young adults, those under 30, has dropped in the last two 
decades. Not surprisingly, television, video, movies and computer screens 
emerged as the villains in this trend, as the report cited indications that 
America is moving from being a reading nation to a "watching" nation. 
Americans, the endowment determined, spend four times as much leisure time 
watching television or listening to the radio as they do reading books, 
magazines or newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Countering this slide somewhat, the study showed an increase in recreational 
reading among the elderly. The endowment predicted that the offsetting habits 
of older and younger readers may mean that overall levels of recreational 
reading will not change dramatically in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
The report was written by Nicholas Zill, a social psychologist who is the 
executive director of a Washington research group called Child Trends, and 
Marianne Winglee, a statistical analyst in Washington. The two authors urged 
additional research into how people make their reading selections. Noting that 
when readers picked up a book simply because it "looked interesting," but 
without any information about its contents, they experienced a positive 
reaction just 40% of the time, Zill and Winglee recommended literature guidance 
programs that might read something like, "If you liked Book A, you'll probably 
enjoy Books B, C or D." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the research suggests that a lot of people read things because they 
are interested in the subject matter," Zill said in a telephone interview from 
his office in Washington. "It's not necessarily the literature for its own 
sake, but what it's about." To capitalize on this finding, Zill said librarians 
and bookstore owners should offer displays that "mix fiction and nonfiction" as 
well as providing guidance and information. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things is to give people more information, guide them to books that 
will be rewarding to them," Zill said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested that since genre fiction does enjoy such popularity, 
supporters of "quality" literature might try to determine which works are 
likely to appeal to which genre readers. For example, horror fans might pick up 
Mary Shelley, while aficionados of romance might read the Bronte sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a way to build on the fact that people like genre fiction," Zill said. 
"I think we have to do some creative steering." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he felt that government agencies, including the NEA, should "play 
a more active role" in promoting popular writers along with those who may be 
less well known but more "literary." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just getting somewhat off the high throne of literature and art and 
realizing that you have to communicate with people," Zill said. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that you've got this very dominant anti-intellectual pop 
culture," he added, "someone has to be out there promoting the other side." 
</P>
<P>
"Spy Notes," a parody of the collegiate standby "Cliff's Notes," does not 
infringe the rights of Cliff's Notes Inc., according to a 2nd U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals decision rendered Sept. 5. The reasoning for that decision was 
not released until Sept. 23 when a three-judge panel wrote: "We conclude that 
the parody cover of Spy Notes, although it surely conjures up the original and 
goes to great lengths to use some of the identical colors and aspects of the 
cover design of Cliff's Notes, raises only a slight risk of consumer confusion 
that is outweighed by the public interest in free expression." 
</P>
<P>
The parody, whose publication had been blocked by a lower-court decision, 
includes the "Novel-O-Matic," a kind of literary slide rule for the automatic 
creation of the 1980s novel, as well as humorous summaries of such 1980s hits 
as Jay McInerney's "Bright Lights, Big City" and Tama Janowitz's "Slaves of New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
Also from Washington comes word that the White House Office of Management and 
Budget has backed away from a proposed policy that would have given private 
companies almost exclusive access to government information. The move should 
please the American Library Assn., among other groups, which had strongly 
opposed the OMB's proposal that government agencies rely on private companies 
to package and sell data from government files. Critics from the ALA and 
elsewhere expressed concern that the OMB action would give the private groups 
too much control over the government information. They also feared that the 
government would in essence be forcing the public to pay twice for the data: 
once through taxes to support the original compilation of the material and 
again in order to purchase it from private information suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing its decision not to transfer the material to private hands, the 
OMB made a veiled acknowledgement of the protests. "OMB wishes to make clear," 
the announcement said, "that its fundamental philosophy is that government 
information is a public asset." 
</P>
<P>
WHO'S NEXT? THUCYDIDES? American Way magazine, the in-flight publication of 
American Airlines, has announced that it will sponsor a Faulkner Write-Alike 
Contest and crown the winner at the 1990 Faulkner Conference at the University 
of Mississippi. Doug Crichton, editor of American Way, described the contest as 
offering "sanctuary to literary clonists." He said entries should be submitted 
to the magazine as 250-to-500-word prose stories or essays that draw on 
Faulkner's style, language, themes, characters or plots.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BINGO BY RITA MAE BROWN (BANTAM: $4.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Bingo," Rita Mae Brown uses the pleasures of small-town life to explore the 
need to belong -- to a family and a community. Nichole (Nickel) Smith, the 
lesbian ace journalist of the Runnymede Clarion, finds herself drawn into the 
conflict between the depersonalized world of corporate acquisitions and local 
control of affairs when the owner of the newspaper decides to sell it and 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's Runnymede, an antebellum town that straddles the Mason-Dixon Line, is 
as richly improbable as Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon. Among its more notable 
inhabitants are Nichole's adoptive mother, Julia Hunsenmeir, and her sister, 
Louise. These fractious octogenarians have been quarreling for so long -- and 
have gotten so good at it -- that their spats have become a spectator sport in 
Runnymede. "Bingo" blends honest sentiment with a sassy irreverence, but avoids 
both mawkishness and flip vulgarity.

CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: 'A TALE OF TWO CITIES' BY KEITH LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was the skunk at the picnic during the 
summer bicentennial of the French Revolution in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget, she said, that the storming of the Bastille was followed by the 
Reign of Terror. 
</P>
<P>
In her ambivalence about the revolution, Thatcher has company in 20th-Century 
France (see Page 15) and worthy antecedents in 19th-Century England. In "A Tale 
of Two Cities," for example, Charles Dickens revealed his doubts about anarchy, 
even when it is provoked by the kinds of inequities his writings exposed. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Bastille was taken on July 14, 1789, Dr. Guillotin : had 
invented an unforgettable instrument for executions. Heads soon rolled, often 
for the slightest offense to the mob running France. 
</P>
<P>
"A Tale of Two Cities" is as compelling on audio cassette as it is in print. It 
is Dickens' tightest story, spoiled only occasionally by melodrama, and I 
highly recommend it while France's commemorative fervor is fresh. 
</P>
<P>
But consider having at your side a footnoted copy of the book (the Penguin 
paperback is excellent), because "A Tale of Two Cities" is an example of the 
challenge sometimes presented by recorded books: How to comprehend references 
that have become obscure over the years. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as Dickens sets the scene leading up to the revolution, he writes: 
"The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the 
suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled." 
</P>
<P>
Many readers in Dickens' day knew why he placed the Defarge wine shop in Saint 
Antoine. But it took a footnote to refresh my memory that it was the destitute 
residents of Saint Antoine who formed the core of the revolutionary mob. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there is Dickens' lively description of Old Bailey, the London court 
where Charles Darnay was on trial. 
</P>
<P>
You probably don't need a footnote to explain Old Bailey, but you might want 
one a few seconds later when Dickens compares the court to "Bedlam" as a place 
for cheap entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Bedlam was shorthand for the Bethleham Hospital for the Insane, a place where 
some 18th-Century Londoners went to watch the inmates for amusement. 
</P>
<P>
You need no footnotes, however, for the breathtaking passages that begin with 
the storming of the Bastille. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the story becomes a fury in the voice of a good reader, especially that 
of British actor Richard Pasco, whose reading for Cover to Cover Cassettes Ltd. 
was far and away the best I sampled. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Come, then!,' " thunders Pasco as Monsieur Defarge. " 'Patriots and friends, 
we are ready! The Bastille!' " 
</P>
<P>
Pasco is so attuned to the subtleties of "A Tale of Two Cities" that one 
wonders how many hours he must have spent with the text before approaching the 
microphone. The listening time for this unabridged reading is 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
And though you cannot rent the Cover to Cover cassettes, Dickens fans will find 
the purchase price worth it at 33.75, or about $55 at current exchange rates. 
(The rates fluctuate and the company will put the most current on Visa or 
Mastercard orders.) 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, dramatizations of classics measure up to the unabridged readings, 
and such is the case with a BBC radio production of "A Tale of Two Cities" that 
is offered by The Mind's Eye of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
British actor Charles Dance plays Sydney Carton and none other than Richard 
Pasco is Mr. Lorry. Dickens' prose is enhanced by such sound effects as the 
thundering of hooves and the rolling of the tumbrils to the guillotine. The 
listening time is little over 6 hours, and the cassettes sell for $24.95. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to rent an unabridged reading of "A Tale of Two Cities," I highly 
recommend Frank Muller's for Recorded Books, which rents for $15.50 a month. 
Books on Tape also offers a good reading of this novel by British actress 
Angela Cheyne at the monthly rate of $16.50.

WATER, POWER AND DADDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FOR ALL THE TREND-SETTING, high-profile employers that call Southern California 
home, it's probably the dowdy, old Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
that pays the most attention to the demands that parenthood imposes on its male 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP, which has a work force that is 77% male, partially subsidizes day care 
for employees' children at two downtown centers and is building a child-care 
center of its own in the San Fernando Valley. A counselor in the department's 
employee-assistance program specializes in child-rearing problems. Lunch-hour 
seminars for fathers cover such issues as fathering after divorce, discipline 
and preparing for the birth of a first child. A "parenting fair" this summer 
drew as many men as women to wander amid booths promoting day-care centers, 
child safety, referral services and educational toys. 
</P>
<P>
A 1985 survey that indicated that employees' child-care-related difficulties 
were costing the DWP $1 million annually in absences, tardiness and wasted time 
set the utility on the road to creating programs that would help employees 
better balance work and family responsibilities. To the surprise of officials 
who thought the work-family conflict was a women's issue, 400 of the 1,000 DWP 
employees who take advantage of the programs are men. Because their employer, 
and not their wives' employers, offers such assistance, many of the men have 
taken over responsibility for arranging their children's day care. 
</P>
<P>
DWP executives figure that the assistance pays for itself, not only by reducing 
lost time but by improving worker loyalty as well. "You don't find steam-plant 
operators walking down the street," says Beverly King, director of human 
resources. "It costs us a lot if we lose someone who's highly skilled because 
we weren't responsive to their needs." 
</P>
<P>
White-collar male employees seem more satisfied with the department's efforts 
than blue-collar workers, whose schedules, department officials acknowledge, 
may prevent them from attending seminars and whose bosses may be less 
understanding of men's evolving role in family life. 
</P>
<P>
Still, compared to most jobs, "men here probably get more support," says Rona 
Cohen, a nurse who provides counseling and leads parenting groups at the 
utility. "It's a process," she says. "It takes time." JIM SCHACHTER

A COLLEGE BOOKSTORE COMES OUT OF THE CELLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I can just see it," said a student wearing a University of Southern California 
Trojans T-shirt as he stepped through the security gates of the new campus 
bookstore. "Attention, Trojan shoppers!" he intoned solemnly. "On Level Three, 
a special on . . . ring binders!" 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't far off. The new USC bookstore has a distinct modern-department-store 
look. Opened for business July 17 on the main campus drag and inaugurated last 
week, it occupies 34,000 square feet in a new five-story building that cost the 
university $8.8 million in construction and installation. The retail operation 
takes up four floors, connected by central banks of escalators -- not high on 
the list of things one expects to see in a bookstore. Sleek shelving is set not 
in the old-fashioned perpendicular way but diagonally to the aisles; marketing 
experts have discovered that this configuration draws the eye through the store 
and invites browsing. 
</P>
<P>
The clearest trend in college bookstores, says Elizabeth Kennedy, marketing 
manager of the USC facility, is that "we're moving out of the attitude that 
students have to shop here just because we're here and we're accessible. 
Universities didn't use to invest much in college stores -- they put them in 
the basement." 
</P>
<P>
College stores have come out of the cellar. In recent years, money has been 
poured into these operations. UC San Diego is dedicating its newly expanded 
store this week, and UC Irvine is constructing a larger bookstore, due to open 
in January as part of its new UCI Student Center. Since the surge in college 
enrollment during the 1970s, estimates Garis Distelhorst, executive director of 
the National Assn. of College Stores, as many as four out of five college 
stores have been "renovated, remodeled or rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
The old USC store occupied only 8,300 square feet in the student commons. 
Although ranked only 10th nationally in total sales among college stores in 
1988-89, it sold more per square foot than any other store -- a statistical way 
of saying it was immensely crowded. The store was so small that at "rush" time 
-- the beginning of a term, when students buy required course materials -- 
one-third of all the general books were physically packed up and moved out to 
make space for texts. The new store is so spacious that students lining up for 
rush purchases are ushered neatly through a rope maze leading to the cash 
registers; in the old plan, no such open floor space was available, and 
customers just jammed the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
With the variety of merchandise in the store, the role of textbooks, the 
backbone of the college store operation, has shifted. At USC, the merchandising 
strategy is to use texts -- which students must buy here -- to draw customers 
through the store. Texts are located on the top floor, so to find them, 
students must pass through the general book department on Level 2 (a 
below-ground-level department sells clothing and gifts and has a separate 
outside entrance), swing through professional books, computer equipment and 
office supplies on Level 3, and ride up to textbooks at the top. Along the way, 
arranged in clear plastic display cubes along the escalator banks, are "impulse 
items" -- colorful calendars, office supplies, selected gift items -- that 
managers hope will tempt customers to add a few dollars to their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
An increased emphasis on general books accounts for some of the impulse to 
expand. Although they are the least profitable of the items sold in these 
stores, additional floor space and personnel is being devoted to a range of 
books from faculty publications to best sellers, and even children's books. 
</P>
<P>
"General books are among the slowest sellers, but on a campus, they are one of 
the most important areas for the academic mission of the store," says 
Distelhorst. "Depending on the quality of the bookstore and selection, a 
general book department doesn't have to be unprofitable, but there are other 
reasons for having a big department. It sets a tone." 
</P>
<P>
"It pays to have a great selection of books," Kennedy agrees. "We're finding 
that prospective new faculty visiting the campus will look at the library and 
the bookstore. It weighs in their decision to come to the school." 
</P>
<P>
USC Bookstores director Jack Arnold anticipates that when the bookstore hits 
its stride, there will be 80,000 titles in the general book department -- 
representing a five-fold increase over the old inventory and comparing 
favorably with the figures at large general bookstores. Attention to 
small-press books and California authors is evident in the selection. 
</P>
<P>
The bookstore's relationship to the outside community is still unclear, 
however. According to Arnold, an edge-of-campus site for the new store was 
briefly considered, but rejected in favor of the central location. Parking is a 
major problem for visitors who might want to drop by to browse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual for a college bookstore to aggressively pursue business 
off-campus," Distelhorst says. "The movement is rather in the opposite 
direction. Local businesses feel threatened" by the sense that college stores 
have tax advantages because of their institutional affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
In one particularly high-profile case now before the California Supreme Court, 
two Marin County booksellers sued a national bookstore chain that managed a 
store under contract to a local college; they sought an injunction preventing 
the college store from selling non-required texts. 
</P>
<P>
General book department manager Candace Moreno, on the other hand, takes a 
longer view. "Parking is a problem, but we'll come up with something," she 
says. "Downtown is moving in this direction. It may not be here for another 
decade or so, but you can feel it coming this way. We're going to be in the 
heart of L.A. in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Parking instructions for visitors to the USC Bookstore: Be persistent and 
avoid days when football games are scheduled. Enter the campus through Gate 2, 
located on Figueroa Street just north of Exposition Boulevard. Tell the parking 
attendant you are headed for the bookstore; a number of metered parking spaces 
have been set aside for this purpose.

More sequels due in coming months: "Halloween V" (from Galaxy), "Leatherface: 
Texas Chainsaw Massacre III" (New Line), "Back to the Future II" (Universal), 
"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" (Warners), and "Two Jakes," the 
long-awaited sequel to "Chinatown" (Paramount). 
</P>
<P>
Already talked-about for next summer's slate: "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent 
Adventure II" (Orion), "48 Hours II" (Paramount), "RoboCop II" (Orion), 
"Gremlins II" (Warners), "Exorcist III: 1990", "Back to the Future III" 
(Universal), and "The Young Guns II" (Fox). 
</P>
<P>
Also planned: "Basket Case 2" (Shapiro/Glickenhaus), "Child's Play II" 
(Universal), "Good Morning Chicago" (Touchstone), "The Rescuers Down Under" 
(Disney), "Ernest Goes to Jail"(Disney), "Three Men and a Little Lady" 
(Touchstone), "The NeverEnding Story II" (Warners), and "Rock and Roll High 
School Forever" (Concorde). 
</P>
<P>
And look at some titles just registered with the MPAA: "Naked Gun II" 
(Paramount), "Action Jackson II" (Warners), "Predator II: Body Count" (Fox), 
and "Die Hard II: The Taking of Los Angeles International" -- an alternate 
title for "Die Harder" (Fox). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talk persists about a possible "Batman II" and a follow-up to "9 1/2 
Weeks." And "Godfather III" (Paramount) is casting. 
</P>
<P>
And while "Highlander" grossed a mere $5.6 million domestically for Fox, it 
took in $100 million internationally. That's why director Russell Mulcahy and 
actor Christopher Lambert are reteaming for . . . "Highlander II." Pat H.

"Rocky V" finally begins production for United Artists in early November, 
re-teaming director John Avildsen (from the very first "Rocky") with Sylvester 
Stallone. This one has Rocky playing mentor to a kid named Danny Durrock, a 
product of foster homes and a prison stint. When Danny (not yet cast) returns 
to his errant ways, it's up to you-know-who to set him straight. 
</P>
<P>
But not in the ring, Stallone tells us. He said this one will wrap "with the 
biggest street fight since 'The Quiet Man.' " It's due next May. Pat H. Broeske

Shelley Long -- who departed TV's "Cheers" in 1987 -- will return to the small 
screen as the star of a four-hour mini-series for ABC and New World TV, "When 
Rabbit Howls," about a woman beset with multiple personalities. Based on the 
autobiography of Truddi Chase, the mini-series will chronicle her illness and 
therapy following a childhood of being terrorized by a stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Emmy-winner Lamont Johnson will direct and co-produce with E. Jack 
Neuman, who scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Planned for airing during next May's sweeps, the heavily dramatic role marks a 
departure for Long, who's had mixed success with a string of comedy features. 
</P>
<P>
("Troop Beverly Hills," her last, grossed less than $15 million.) 
</P>

"The thing to remember," said a rep for director Johnson, "is that years and 
years ago, when we thought of Sally Field, it was as 'The Flying Nun.' We 
didn't take her seriously, until she did 'Sybil.' " Pat H. Broeske

L.A.'S PASSAGE TO INDIA; 
</P>
<P>
THE BHARAT BAZAAR BRINGS A WEALTH OF FLAVORS FROM THE EAST TO THE WESTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANY WHO THINK they know Indian food, based on their experience dining in 
restaurants, are amazed when they first visit the Bharat Bazaar and gain some 
inkling of how vast and varied the cuisine can be. This well-stocked market in 
Los Angeles is run by Phulan Chander, who guides shoppers through its aisles in 
her flowing sari and jogging shoes, pointing the way to ingredients and 
explaining how to use them. 
</P>
<P>
"Add a spoon of this to your rice," she suggests, indicating biryani masala (a 
spice blend from Bombay that includes coriander, turmeric and peppercorn). Or 
she'll offer a taste of mint chutney, and if the reaction is favorable, she'll 
tell how to make it. 
</P>
<P>
Recently she invited a customer to the stockroom to watch her prepare sooji ka 
halwa, a dessert made with cream of wheat (sooji). Working over a tiny hot 
plate, Chander fried the cereal in ghee (Indian-style clarified butter) until 
the grains glistened. Then she stirred in sugar and water to make a thick 
pudding. The subtle, toasty taste of the ghee should be seasoning enough, she 
says, but one could also add cardamom and almonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Bharat Bazaar is owned by Chander's husband, Ramesh, who oversees the 
family's wholesale warehouse in Hawthorne while his wife runs the market. Other 
family members own four stores in Northern California. The proliferation of 
such businesses reflects the growth of California's Indian population. About 
70,000 people of Indian origin now live in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
estimates Mangu Rohit, president of the Federation of Indian Assns. The 
greatest concentration is in Cerritos, and the major shopping district is 
"Little India" in Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chander has lived in the United States for 20 years, she is still 
thoroughly Indian -- a Punjabi Brahman, she says. That means she is a Hindu of 
the highest caste and comes from the Punjab in northwestern India. Born in 
Jullundur, Chander often wears a Punjabi suit -- a long silky top over pants. 
The athletic shoes that she has adopted are a practical way to deal with long 
hours of standing. 
</P>
<P>
Located on a quiet stretch of Washington Boulevard, the Bharat Bazaar is the 
Westside's answer to Bombay's bustling Crawford Market or Delhi's venerable 
shopping street, Chandni Chowk. Of course, it's a lot smaller and quieter than 
either of those. But the scope of the stock is amazing. Along with such staples 
as basmati rice (an aromatic long-grain rice from Northern India), spices, 
lentils and ghee, there are rare fresh curry leaves, which are essential to 
South Indian cookery, and fresh methi (fenugreek) leaves. Methi is used in a 
variety of dishes, including the flat cornmeal bread that is typical of Punjabi 
cuisine. Sometimes the market has pale, magenta-bordered pea pods called papdi, 
or a small green vegetable with pretty striations, known in India as tindora. 
Okra and bitter melon are also usually on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Rich sweets stacked in plastic containers on the counter might include bright 
green pistachio burfi; round, syrup-soaked gulab jamun and squares of 
saffron-yellow patisa topped with cardamom and melon seeds. Nearby is a pan 
full of potato-stuffed samosas (deep-fried pastry). And usually there is paan, 
which Indians chew after meals as a digestive. Paan consists of a fresh betel 
leaf folded around betel nut and various flavorings. Chewing it reddens the 
tongue and produces a faint numb sensation. Some find paan addictive, but 
Chander warns that overindulgence is not good for the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Like bazaars in India, Chander's market is a sociable place that offers much 
more than food. Community notices are posted on a bulletin board, and families 
drop in to rent Indian films on videotape. "This a good movie?" Chander 
inquires as a customer returns a video. Shelves near the entrance hold 
cassettes of religious songs, Punjabi music and the haunting melodies known as 
ghazals. Sometimes Chander plays these to make the shop more lively. 
</P>
<P>
 One counter displays multicolor bangles for slim wrists. There are also saris 
and scarfs, incense from Mysore, herbal toothpaste from Calcutta, Indian 
cigarettes called bidis and cobra-head spoons that are used in temple worship. 
Kitchenware includes three-legged round boards for rolling out chapatis (Indian 
bread), gleaming steel boxes to hold the cooked chapatis, woks from Bombay and 
steaming racks for idli, which are small cakes made of ground rice and lentils. 
</P>
<P>
Non-Indians come in with shopping lists from cookbooks, and Chander directs 
them to such unfamiliar items as jumbo black cardamoms, pungent-tasting black 
salt and amchoor powder, a souring agent ground from dried mangoes. 
</P>
<P>
Indian shoppers are eager to help, too, and a question about cooking can set 
off a lively discussion. One interchange concerned milk masala, a costly blend 
of nuts and spices that is almost impossible to find outside of India. "Just 
make it yourself," advises Chander. All you do, she explains, is grind together 
pistachios, almonds, saffron and cardamom. A spoonful of this blended with hot 
milk and sugar produces a bracing beverage that is India's answer to hot 
chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Despite long hours on duty, Chander cooks wholesome, traditional meals for her 
husband and two children, even making chapatis twice a day. "I take time, but 
I'm making very good food," she says. The Chanders are strict vegetarians, as 
are many Indians, so their meals concentrate on dal (lentils); vegetables, 
which often come from their garden; fruits; bread, and yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
Although ghee is basic to the Indian larder, Chander often switches to olive 
oil as a health measure. Garam masala -- a blend of such spices as cloves, 
cardamom, cinnamon and pepper -- seasons many of her dishes, and turmeric goes 
into her dals and vegetables. Amchoor adds a pleasant tang to some foods. And 
cilantro, cumin and ginger root are other essentials that appear in the 
following recipes, which are from Chander's personal collection. 
</P>
<P>
The Bharat Bazaar is located at 11510 W. Washington Blvd., Los Angeles, and is 
open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily except Tuesday.

Too many people are trying to reverse the facts of history by pretending that 
the young men we sent to fight and die in Vietnam were heroes who did something 
glorious for us. To the contrary, like the Vietnamese people, our soldiers were 
miserable victims of an insane policy, and their accomplishments came to zero. 
</P>
<P>
Although physically and emotionally damaged, Kim Phuc wants to come here and 
work for reconciliation. That is heroic.

I am a Vietnam vet and a retired U.S. Naval officer. I am shocked that you 
would run such a blatant piece of propaganda as Judith Coburn's "The Girl in 
the Photograph" (Aug. 20). Yes, I feel sorry for Kim Phuc. But is her pain any 
greater than that being suffered by the men still being held captive in 
Southeast Asia? Is her trauma any more severe than that of the families of my 
brothers whose fates have been withheld by the beasts of Hanoi? Should I 
welcome her and her "mission of reconciliation" until my friends come home or I 
know what happened to them? I think not.

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA, UNION SIGN NEW CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After several years of what Musicians Union president Bernie Fleischer 
characterized as "very stormy sailing" in relations between Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra and Local No. 47, the orchestra management, negotiating with 
orchestra players and union leadership, has recently signed a three-year 
agreement with which both sides claim to be satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Fleischer says he attributes the success of the negotiations to three elements: 
"The fact that the union, confronted with a previously adversarial 
relationship, showed that it would not give up or back down. The professional 
and sincere way the Chamber Orchestra management entered into the negotiations. 
And the fact that the ensemble itself, through its players committee, became 
fully involved in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Rutter, executive director of the orchestra, told The Times last week 
that "the willingness of the players to deal in small increments of increase 
(in wages), spread out over time," contributed to the relative "ease with which 
our settlement was reached," and that that "reflects both the stability of the 
orchestra and the positive relationship that exists" between all parties. 
</P>
<P>
Small increments the increases may be, but they move consistently upward. From 
a base scale of $64.40 per rehearsal and $83 per concert (plus an extra 15% for 
"staff players," i.e. regular orchestra members) in 1988-89, the scale slides 
up to $66.33, $85.49 and 18% in 1989-90. From there, it ascends to an eventual 
$70.71, $91.13 and 22% in the final year of the contract (1991-92). Principals 
of the orchestra receive double-scale without the percentage bonus. 
</P>
<P>
As before, there are no guarantees to the musicians for numbers of concerts, 
though the management does give the players its proposed concert schedule for 
the season, which begins in October, during the previous spring. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new contract deals with issues such as auditions, working 
conditions and -- for the first time -- dismissal procedures. The playing 
personnel of the orchestra remains at 41 members, 16 of whom are principals. 
</P>
<P>
ON TOUR: For the 23rd consecutive year, Western Opera Theater (WOT), touring 
arm of San Francisco Opera, has gone on the road, this time with a production 
of Bizet's "Carmen," staged by Dutch director Hans Nieuwenhuis and conducted by 
David Abell. 
</P>
<P>
WOT left the Bay City Wednesday and will be on tour in its first segment of the 
1989-90 season through Nov. 18. States to be visited in this fall portion 
include Alabama, California, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
New Hampshire, New York, North and South Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
The spring portion of the tour begins Jan. 19, when the company returns to 
places in California, Idaho and Washington, and adds Colorado, Montana, Utah 
and New Mexico to its itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
Three Carmens alternate in the title role. They are Stephanie Vlahos, Wendy 
Hoffman and Barbara Leifer. Their Don Joses will be Dennis McNeil, Stephen 
Plummer and John Swenson. Micaela will be sung alternately by Karen Park, 
Cherie Caluda, Angela Randell and Mary Mills, while Escamillo will be Kenn 
Woodward, Hector Vasquez and Eric Frachey. 
</P>
<P>
The tour reaches Southern California in late January, when it touches down in 
Victorville (Jan. 23), Visalia (Jan. 31), Norris Theatre in Palos Verdes (Feb. 
1 and 2), San Bernardino (Feb. 3), Santa Clarita (Feb. 4), the Claremont 
Colleges (Feb. 8) and Bakersfield (Feb. 9 and 11). 
</P>
<P>
IN DANCE: David McNaughton, a long-time principal at San Francisco Ballet, is 
represented both as composer and choreographer in the expanded version of his 
"Gypsy," being performed by Oakland Ballet this week. McNaughton received a 
grant from the Meet the Composer Foundation in order to write the score back in 
1983; originally a 10-minute duet, "Gypsy" has since been enlarged to include 
nine dancers and several more movements. Also on the program, to be performed 
Friday through Sunday at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland: a new, untitled work 
by Ron Thiele, associate artistic director of the Oakland company, and revivals 
of works by Betsy Erickson and artistic director Ronn Guidi . . . Eurythmeum 
Stuttgart, the 16-member eurythmic troupe from West Germany, will give two 
performances in Wadsworth Theater in Westwood, Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 
8. Under the direction of Else Klink, the troupe -- with accompanying musicians 
-- will perform dramatic scenes from Henrik Ibsen's "Peer Gynt," with 
choreography by Klink and the music of Grieg. Actress Mala Powers appears as 
special guest speaker of the text.

ALBUM REVIEW;

RICKIE LEE JONES "FLYING COWBOYS." GEFFEN *** 1/2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hard to believe that Jones is only 34 -- and that her three previous 
worldly-wise albums came out when she was in her 20s, starting with her debut a 
decade ago -- just as it's hard to believe her old partner in beatnikitudes, 
Tom Waits, made so much of his grizzled pop at such a sprightly age. Now that 
they really are adding rings to their respective trees, how much more 
authoritative their music is. 
</P>
<P>
All that comes to mind especially because so many lines in "Flying Cowboys" 
have to do with age. Both of the side-opening numbers (the first of which is a 
lullaby) conclude with the line "When I was young I was a wild, wild one"; 
later on, she quips knowingly, "We've been outlaws on the run / I was just a 
baby when I fired my gun." 
</P>
<P>
Doth the woman protest too much, too soon, you oldsters ask? Nah. "Cowboys" 
does have elements of melancholy and loss, but in fact this awareness of time 
passed really seems to have made Jones sweeter and more good-tempered, if 
anything; it includes several of her simplest and most easily consumed love 
songs ever. 
</P>
<P>
Like all her work, this graceful collection sounds spontaneous and surprising 
and tight and elaborate -- giving all those studio musicians she's once again 
employed something worthwhile to do with their chops. "Cowboys" is neither as 
moving as 1981's "Pirates" nor as complex as 1984's "The Magazine," but in 
adding extra wallops of maturity and lovingness to the streetwise literacy, 
it's scarcely less valuable. CHRIS WILLMAN

PICKS TO CLICK: With such a baseball authority so close at hand, we couldn't 
resist soliciting M.C. Hammer's playoff predictions: 
</P>
<P>
National League: I got to go with the Giants to beat the Cubs. Get the chalk 
out at Candlestick for the Series. I see the Giants winning in five. They have 
better hitting with that tremendous Kevin Mitchell/Will Clark one-two punch. 
I'm telling you -- watch Kevin hit the Wild Thing (Cubs relief ace Mitch 
Williams). He lives on fastballs inside. The Giants pitching speaks for itself. 
Big Daddy (Giants starter Rick Reuschel) will be taking them to school! 
</P>
<P>
 American League: I'm going with Oakland over Toronto in seven. I wish 
Baltimore could've made it -- they were a great Cinderella team. But no one can 
match Oakland's pitching. They have a super closer with Dennis Eckersley, four 
starters with more than 15 wins and a middle-reliever -- Todd Burns -- who 
could be a starter on anyone else's team. Then you have sluggers like Mark 
McGwire and Jose Canseco -- and they even have a catcher, Terry Steinbach, 
hitting .300. Add Ricky Henderson who we got in a great trade -- (Yankees owner 
George) Steinbrenner is already trying to get rid of the guy he got for him -- 
and Oakland is awesome. The Blue Jays are tough -- but Oakland's too much for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Series: I pick Oakland over San Francisco in seven. The Giants have 
their great hitters, but they don't have anyone to match Henderson's speed or 
Eckersley in the bullpen. Last year, Oakland cracked under the pressure. But 
this year they smell the blood. The Giants will be happy just to make it to the 
Series -- they haven't been since the '60s. But the A's will only be happy if 
they win it.

DOUBLE TROUBLE: Two of our fave-rave guitarists are Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jeff 
Beck. So imagine our delight to hear that the rock hot-rods (who are both 
signed to Epic Records) have teamed up for a 25-city tour, beginning Oct. 25 in 
Minneapolis. The duo (who are expected to do an L.A. date in early December) 
will alternate as headliners -- and it's very possible that they'll be jamming 
together at the end of each show. . . . Linda Ronstadt's new "Cry Like a 
Rainstorm . . ." album features (count 'em) four new Jimmy Webb songs, 
including "I Keep it Hid" and "Shattered." . . . If you haven't seen the new 
issue of Hits Magazine, open it -- and keep opening it -- to find a special 
three-page nude centerfold photo of Capitol promo chief John Fagot. Labeled 
Hits Magazine's "Airplay Mate 1989," Fagot is pictured reclining on a couch, 
with a rose in one hand and a phone -- a promo man's No. 1 weapon -- in the 
other. Asked to describe Fagot's physique, Hits editor Lenny Beer quipped: "How 
do you feel about whales?" . . . And Rhino Records (the Westwood Boulevard 
record store, not the label) is touting its "Grand Opening Expansion" 
celebration with a series of wacky discount specials (You already missed 
"Mediocre Student Day" where co-eds with C-level or below report cards received 
a free bargain-bin album). Coming Tuesday is an event guaranteed to raise 
hackles at most record companies: "Home Taping Day," when blank cassettes will 
sell at a 20% discount. (Rhino is also hosting in-store live concerts, 
including one on Thursday at 8 p.m. by Dave Alvin).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With city government funds available to individual artists for the first time 
through the L.A. Endowment, an exhibition at Cal State Northridge's North 
Gallery seems timely. The exhibition, "The Fugue," documents artist Jack 
Reilly's execution and installation of a public arts commission in the city of 
San Diego (a steel sculptural painting on the 120-foot wall adjacent to the 
entrance of the County of San Diego's new Health Services Complex). 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes photo documentation of Reilly's work in progress, 
models from the original proposal, a scaled-down version of one of the pieces, 
and a 30-minute video documentary of the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
The North Gallery is on the college campus, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge. The 
short-lived exhibition closes on Friday. 
</P>
<P>

Photographic Arts, San Diego Museum of Art, Timken Art Gallery and Centro 
Cultural de la Raza.

Center (3540 N. Mission Road, Los Angeles) Friday through next Sunday. 
</P>

KUDOS: L.A. Artcore, a nonprofit visual arts organization devoted to helping 
emerging Los Angeles artists advance their careers, has selected Mark Moore, 
director of The Works galleries (Long Beach and Costa Mesa), to receive the 
organization's first Award of Merit. The award will be presented during the 
group's first annual Award of Merit Benefit on Oct. 29, which will also include 
a silent auction of works from more than 25 Los Angeles artists. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Artcore was formed nine years ago to give artists an exhibition space for 
their work, to create job opportunities in teaching programs and workshops, and 
to provide specific experience in the professional installation of exhibitions 
in corporate offices, community venues and L.A. Artcore's own galleries. 
Honoree Moore represents more than 40 artists, including Lita Albuquerque, 
Peter Alexander, Billy Al Bengston, Tony Delap, Craig Kauffman, Jim Morphesis 
and Eric Orr.

WHAT ABOUT 'CATS'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take offense at some of the inane remarks made by Timberlake Wertenbaker in 
your " 'Angry Young Man' is a Woman" article of Sept. 10. So films are for 
children, and plays are the "real" intellectual voice? Might I suggest to our 
pompous playwright that Olivier made "Hamlet"; Welles made "Citizen Kane," and 
Coppola made the "Godfather" films -- all for adults. I guess "Starlight 
Express," "Cats" and, God-only-knows, how many dreary theater revivals are 
Wertenbaker's idea of stimulation for the mind.

I was puttering around my kitchen in East Syracuse, N.Y., the other morning, 
without the slightest hint that the sky was going to fall. The announcer on the 
local public radio station began talking about KFAC, AM and FM. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in Los Angeles, and I also grew up listening to the programs on KFAC. 
My mom kept the radio dial glued to KFAC, partly because she enjoyed the music, 
and partly, I suspect, to instill a little culture in me . . . well, it worked. 
I grew to love the music I heard on that wonderful station. 
</P>
<P>
Good grief -- does everything in this country have to be propelled by dollars? 
Classical music has a small audience in the United States because it takes a 
little education, a little time, and a little patience to develop a familiarity 
with the work of the great masters. The flip side of that coin, and sadly the 
one that many people never experience, is that once you let classical music 
into your life, you will enter into a love affair with Beauty; an affair that 
will last a lifetime, because classical music embodies qualities of symmetry, 
grace, and lyricism that no other musical form can hope to match. Now, a great 
source for the perpetuation of that treasured Beauty is gone.

Regarding Lawrence Christon's article "Live from New York" (Sept. 17), I am 
shocked that he neglected to mention one of the most extraordinarily accurate 
satirists of the last 15 years: Christopher Guest. Not only was he arguably the 
main component of the National Lampoon Radio Hour, but for two seasons he 
astonished us with his comedic flexibility, musical prowess and character 
subtlety.

The litany about the loss of KFAC as a classical music station has offered 
little in the way of a practical stratagem to restore this asset. I believe the 
following has merit: Listen to the new KFAC long enough to identify the 
sponsors. Write a letter to them (with a copy to KFAC) saying you will not buy 
their goods or service as long as they support KFAC as a rock broadcaster. It 
is possible that without donations, without foundation grants and with the 
voice of those who love classical music, the Philistines may yet be beaten at 
their own money game.

It was just two years ago that American Suzuki Motor Corp., basking in the 
popularity of its Samurai sport vehicle, predicted that it would soon be 
selling a full line of automobiles in America. By 1990, the company -- best 
known for its motorcycles -- expected to sell 300,000 cars and sport utility 
vehicles in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed for Suzuki since then and most of it for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the Samurai have plummeted to 3,399 in the first eight months of this 
year from a high of 81,349 in 1987. And sales of four new models introduced in 
the past year have been dismal: As of Sept. 1, Suzuki had sold only 21,389 cars 
and sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
As the crucial 1990-model season gets into full swing, American Suzuki appears 
unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, American Suzuki's president was reassigned to corporate 
headquarters in Japan, and three core members of the company's American 
management team abruptly resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The shake-up shocked Suzuki dealers, whose first shipments of 1990 vehicles 
were arriving that day. The company is not saying whether it plans to name 
replacements for the executives who resigned. The three were widely credited 
for the Samurai's early success. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other changes at American Suzuki's Brea headquarters. More than 
15% of the Orange County headquarters staff -- or about 25 workers -- were laid 
off earlier this year, a high-ranking executive of Suzuki's parent company in 
Japan took over as chairman of the operation in July, and the company is 
seeking a new advertising agency as the selling season begins. 
</P>
<P>
As Vice President Doug Mazza, Sales Director John Dorsey and National Sales 
Manager Larry Messelt were resigning last week, marketing strategies for the 
1990-model season were still being developed and the company's only advertising 
was on billboards. The resignations left other plans undecided and raised 
speculation from analysts about more resignations or layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Issue 
</P>
<P>
"The best anyone can do is guess at where this company is headed," said Jeremy 
Anwyl, an auto industry consultant in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The decline of Brea-based American Suzuki can be traced to June, 1988, when the 
publisher of Consumer Reports magazine sharply criticized the safety of the 
Samurai, claiming that it was more prone to rolling over than other sport 
utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki spent millions of dollars on rebates and lobbying in Washington to 
defend itself against the accusation. Early this year, Suzuki won vindication 
when a federal study concluded that the vehicle was no more susceptible to 
rolling over than other similar sport trucks. By March, Suzuki officials said 
the problem had been put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
However, not only has the Samurai failed to recover, but a Suzuki spokeswoman 
now acknowledges that the attacks on the Samurai have also tainted the image of 
Suzuki's four other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The Sidekick -- a utility vehicle similar to the Samurai -- and three models of 
the spunky Swift subcompact car have earned praise from reviewers, but sales 
have been disappointing. One Swift model, the GLX, has sold fewer than 1,000 
units and is being dropped from the 1990 line. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the Samurai, people don't have another image of Suzuki, except maybe as 
a motorcycle maker," said Anwyl, president of the ad agency USP Automotive 
Advertising. "When people criticized the Samurai, they might as well have been 
criticizing the whole Suzuki name." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials declined to discuss their marketing or sales plans, which for 
several years were developed largely by Mazza. Industry analysts describe the 
next several months as a crucial period for American Suzuki to rebuild identity 
with consumers and with Suzuki's U.S. dealers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dealers Disenchanted 
</P>
<P>
"Following these resignations, if they don't come back very strong with a lot 
of money, some new products and some major personnel announcements, (American 
Suzuki) might as well just go away," said Lee Sattley, vice president of 
operations for Astro Management, which closed its Lakewood Suzuki dealership in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Sattley said his company, which still operates large Nissan and Mazda 
dealerships, decided to shut down its Suzuki operations "to stop the bleeding." 
He said he expects that other dealers will likely consider doing the same in 
the wake of last week's resignations. 
</P>
<P>
"When you aren't getting a return on investment, and I don't imagine many 
dealers are, you look at your level of confidence in management," Sattley said. 
"Now, with basically all the familiar leadership decimated, it's pretty hard to 
have confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Many dealers made fast and hefty profits in 1986 and 1987 on the Samurai, which 
was introduced in 1985. Now they get few requests for either the Samurai or the 
Swift, which holds the honor as the most fuel-efficient import for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The struggles of Suzuki are similar to those faced by the West German auto 
maker Audi. In 1986, CBS' "60 Minutes" aired a story that said the Audi 5000 
had a tendency to suddenly and dangerously accelerate. It wasn't until July of 
this year that the federal government cleared Audi in a major report, and 
concluded that the problem resulted from driver error. 
</P>
<P>
But Audi's sales -- across the board, not just for the 5000 -- have fallen 
precipitously over the past three years. After peaking at 73,000 cars in 1985, 
sales fell to 23,000 last year, and analysts say Audi may never regain its 1985 
sales level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Identity Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
"With Audi and Suzuki, once these companies were damaged, they can be 
vindicated and bring out the best product anywhere, but it doesn't make much 
difference," said George Peterson, president of Auto Pacific Group, a 
consulting firm in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki's "identity crisis," as one analyst described it, first took its toll at 
the dealer level. 
</P>
<P>
When Suzuki officials decided that clearing the Samurai name was the company's 
top priority, most of the company's resources were directed to that effort for 
several months. As a result, Suzuki's long-time strategy of maintaining close 
relationships with dealers started to weaken, said Jesse Snyder, West Coast 
editor of Automotive News. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said that when Suzuki introduced the Samurai in 1985, the company spent 
a great deal of time calling on dealers and listening to their ideas and 
complaints. This was important in helping Suzuki build dealer loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Because Suzuki did not have a broad line of cars, the company couldn't insist 
that dealers sell only Suzukis. Instead, they signed up dealers whose lots were 
crowded with Nissans, Toyotas, Plymouths or Fords. 
</P>
<P>
After the Samurai controversy erupted, dealers continued to hang the Suzuki 
sign on their lots, but few customers were asking about Suzukis and few 
salesmen were having much luck selling the cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Suzuki went to the back of the dealer's mind, and it hasn't come back," Snyder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Respond 
</P>
<P>
Bart Thomson, who was sales manager of Cormier Suzuki in Lake Forest, described 
Suzuki as slow to respond to dealers' needs. Some dealers felt that they 
weren't getting the answers that they needed to questions about the Samurai's 
safety and its future. Cormier, which operates dealerships for several car 
makers, closed its Suzuki dealership in August when it sold its franchise to 
Superior Suzuki in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said Suzuki is now trying to be responsive again. 
</P>
<P>
"They're asking us what we think," said John Mason, sales manager of Duarte 
Suzuki. Duarte sold 78 Suzukis in August and was American Suzuki's top dealer 
for the month. Suzuki's 285 dealers sold fewer than 12 cars each on average in 
August, a volume considered to be anemic. 
</P>
<P>
As an incentive to its dealers, Suzuki in August agreed to pay half the cost of 
its dealers' advertising, at least through the end of October. Right now, that 
advertising makes up most of American Suzuki's advertising effort. 
</P>
<P>
When Kenji Shimizu relocated from Japan to Orange County to take the newly 
created position of chairman of all of Suzuki's U.S. businesses, including a 
struggling motorcycle operation, he said he planned to restore auto sales by 
increasing the company's ad budget. 
</P>
<P>
However, when the 1990 Sidekick and the three-door Swift GA were introduced 
Sept. 25, Suzuki had no major ad campaign to accompany the new models. While 
other auto makers are spending millions of dollars for sophisticated television 
and magazine ad campaigns, Suzuki's only ads will be on billboards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency Hunt 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki put its advertising account up for review early in the summer, and had 
planned to name a new agency in mid-September. However, presentations from 
prospective agencies were abruptly canceled when Shimizu and then-president 
Toshiyuki Arai were called to Japan for meetings. It was Arai who was later 
reassigned to the home office. 
</P>
<P>
Presentations by the ad agencies have been rescheduled for the middle of 
October, but some analysts said Suzuki may not have an ad campaign for the rest 
of its fiscal year, which ends March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki spokeswoman Laura Segall said Suzuki may have a new campaign before 
April but no decision has been made and she declined to discuss the size of 
this year's ad budget. At the height of the Samurai's popularity, annual ad 
spending was estimated at $60 million. For fiscal 1989, the figure fell to $30 
million, and this year's total might be less than $20 million, industry 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have the finest cars. But if nobody knows about you, you won't sell 
them," Anwyl said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that for 1990, Suzuki appears to be de-emphasizing the Samurai, 
which for the first time is only available with a soft-top. Instead, the 
Sidekick and Swift are available with more options. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Competition 
</P>
<P>
A new Swift three-door hatchback with a retail price of $6,400 will make Suzuki 
more competitive in 1990, analyst Peterson said. An early version of the car 
was introduced in California in July. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder of Automotive News said there is still a glut of inexpensive vehicles 
similar to most Swift models. And the Swifts are not the cheapest or sportiest 
of the cars that they compete against, he said. 
</P>
<P>
American Suzuki also increasingly is competing against its own parent company, 
Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. in Japan. In addition to selling cars through American 
Suzuki, the parent company sells its Sidekick and a version of the Swift to 
General Motors, which includes them in its Geo line, an increasingly popular 
line of import cars from several manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The Sidekick is sold as the Geo Tracker and the Geo Metro is a Swift, described 
by American Suzuki as a "stripped-down model." 
</P>
<P>
"What is the reason for the Swift to be marketed as the Swift?" Anwyl asked 
rhetorically. "There doesn't seem to be one."

JAMES FLANIGAN: WHY ARE THE DODGERS LIKE THE MUPPETS?

<TEXT>
<P>
October once again, the maddest month in sports with baseball's league 
playoffs, the World Series and the National Football League combining to 
provide a harvest of televised attractions. 
</P>
<P>
But who's watching? Fact is, the ratings are down for football, according to 
Nielsen Media Research, whether for the games played on CBS and NBC on Sunday 
or for Monday Night Football on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for baseball: The league playoffs have been declining in the 
ratings, and even the World Series is down to 23.9% last year -- when Oakland 
played Los Angeles -- from peak ratings of 28.6% in 1986 -- when Boston played 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
That means money -- at least $9,000 in the price of a 30-second commercial for 
each ratings percentage point. And low ratings may be crucial at the moment 
because the National Football League -- which receives more than $500 million a 
year from its existing contract with the TV networks and ESPN, the cable 
channel -- is entering negotiations for a new TV agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollars Roll In 
</P>
<P>
So what is likely to happen? Against all apparent logic, football is almost 
certain to get a big boost in TV revenues, says Steven Matt, an appraiser of 
sports franchises for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm. "I expect football 
to achieve substantially greater revenues under its new contract," says Matt -- 
"look at what baseball received." 
</P>
<P>
He's referring to the astounding $1.1 billion that CBS has pledged to pay Major 
League Baseball for the right to show the World Series, league playoffs and the 
All-Star game for the next four seasons. ESPN threw in another $400 million so 
that it could show 175 games a season from 1990 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Economics seems upside down in sports. Though half the teams in the NFL are 
losing money, and spiraling player salaries make it certain that some baseball 
teams and many National Basketball Assn. franchises are in the red, the value 
of sports teams keeps rising dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys were sold for $145 million this year, 80% more than the team 
sold for five years ago. Baseball's Seattle Mariners recently sold for $76 
million -- almost six times the price the team last sold for in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
What is going on? Sports has become part of the global entertainment industry 
and is being pushed by the same wild economics that these days cause movie 
studios to sell for billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
First, the television networks want attractions to fill air time and sports 
programs turn out to be cheaper than originating shows or buying movies from 
Hollywood film libraries. Furthermore, there is a demand from advertisers for 
sports programming because it reaches a specific audience -- and sometimes a 
high-income audience, as indicated by the many computer ads aired during 
championship games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Dimension 
</P>
<P>
Second, global industry is not a misnomer. American football is spreading its 
appeal to Europe and Latin America. Baseball is big in Asia and Latin America 
and basketball is established and growing in Europe. An estimated 200 million 
non-Americans watched the last Super Bowl, along with 80 million Americans in 
the households that Nielsen counted; for the World Series, 60 million Americans 
may have been joined by 160 million non-Americans. Numbers like that inspire 
broadcasters to see the total market growing even as U.S. ratings sag. 
</P>
<P>
And others share the vision. Some NFL owners plan to launch a spring league of 
U.S. and non-U.S. teams in 1991, counting on global TV revenues for the games. 
Teams look forward to sales of shirts and caps and souvenirs around the world, 
as global television makes the L.A. Dodgers and New York Giants household names 
in distant lands. "The international dimension is one of the real long-term 
trends in sports," says Michael Megna, of American Appraisal Associates, the 
leading evaluator of sports franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Why are team values rising? Because existing owners will benefit from these 
trends and from the desire of more cities to have a team of their own -- any 
team, as long as it's major league. Sacramento is offering $35 million cash and 
a new taxpayer-financed stadium to lure football's losing Raiders and their 
owner Al Davis up from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even poor businessmen benefit in such an environment: Owner George Steinbrenner 
has turned the once proud New York Yankees into chronic losers, yet Madison 
Square Garden is paying $500 million for 12-year rights to televise Yankee 
games locally. 
</P>
<P>
Money, money. Do traditional fans and a winning team even matter anymore? Yes, 
they do. Baseball has increased attendance by making sure that its parks remain 
safe and attractive for family entertainment, says appraiser Matt, and "you 
have to have strong field performance to keep fans coming." 
</P>
<P>
Still, team image can set values beyond wins and losses. "The Chicago Cubs," 
says appraiser Megna, "have an image the world over, and have a higher value 
than the Chicago White Sox." 
</P>
<P>
Which is only saying in baseball terms what is evident whenever millions are 
paid to acquire films such as "Lawrence of Arabia" or cuddly characters like 
the Muppets: We live in a time when the greatest values lie in recognizable 
entertainment programming for a growing world market. It's the most powerful 
trend in business today.

DEMAND FOR COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED INSECT PREDATORS HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER AS 
FARMERS SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PESTICIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The tools are simple; the task is anything but. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologist Don Norlund is holed up in a bug-filled Weslaco, Tex., laboratory, 
armed with nothing but cardboard grids and swaths of filmy organza cloth, 
trying mightily to drag the insect industry into the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the industry is not using neat technology to produce beneficial 
insects," said Norlund, a research entomologist for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. "It is not automated to any extent whatsoever. It's a lot of 
manual labor." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to aldicarb, a pesticide that contaminated watermelons in 1985, and 
alar, a chemical growth regulator that frightened consumers in 1989, an 
increasing number of farmers are searching for non-chemical methods of pest 
control, and breeders of beneficial bugs throughout North America are having a 
field day. 
</P>
<P>
Demand is outstripping supply for the first time in the industry's short life. 
And nowhere is the bug boom more evident than in California, which has a corner 
on the creepy-crawly market. 
</P>
<P>
But it's no simple task to breed beneficial bugs -- like green lacewings -- 
that eat bad bugs -- such as aphids. The process is low tech and labor 
intensive. There are no quality-control standards. Only one in three 
insectaries actually rears the bugs that it sells. 
</P>
<P>
And while interest in so-called biological control -- pesticide-free methods of 
growing crops -- is at an all-time high, some say the infant insect industry is 
not up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Mass rearing methods have to be developed and maintained and quality control 
programs must be worked up," said Marjorie Hoy, professor of entomology at the 
University of California, Berkeley. "The industry is going to have to police 
itself . . . or people will go back to chemicals. We don't want this to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Don Norlund, the bug world's Henry Ford wanna-be. For the past year, 
Norlund has been trying to find a way to mass produce green lacewings, a 
predatory insect that will attack nearly any soft-bodied bug that crosses its 
path. 
</P>
<P>
His project is the nation's first large-scale attempt to automate the bug 
business, to "gear the system up to a commercial level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, feeding the bugs is extremely inefficient. Because they are 
cannibalistic, they must be kept apart in half-inch square compartments in 
small cardboard grids, he said. The grid has no top or bottom, but is covered 
with strips of organza, a thin, stiff fabric commonly used for women's hats and 
bridal gowns. 
</P>
<P>
To feed the lacewings, strips of flannel are soaked in synthetic liquid food 
and laid underneath the grid, and the bugs suck the liquid out through the 
organza. The problem is that up to 90% of the food stays in the flannel and is 
wasted. So Norlund and his research group are trying to create a diet for the 
lacewings that resembles insect eggs -- prepackaged, intact, cost-effective and 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Harvesting lacewing eggs for sale is also a problem. The bugs secrete a 
substance that forms tiny "stalks" on which they lay their eggs, presumably to 
keep them off the ground and away from ants, which will eat the pale green 
ovals. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to design a cage that . . . would allow you to mechanically 
harvest the eggs off their little stalks," he said. "Right now, it's being done 
by hand. We brush the eggs with a little piece of wadded nylon cloth. It breaks 
the stalks of lots of them, but it also squashes lots. We're looking at ways of 
creating a hot wire to burn the stalk below the eggs and suck the eggs up with 
a vacuum cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
When you figure that it takes up to 20,000 lacewings per acre per season to 
bring aphids, whiteflies, scale and mealybugs under control, you can see why 
technology is so important to the insect industry. 
</P>
<P>
Without it, bug watchers say, insectaries will never be able to supply the 
number of insects necessary to make biological control a viable alternative to 
chemical pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Rincon-Vitova Insectaries Inc. of Ventura County is cooperating with Norlund in 
his attempt to automate the industry. Arguably the oldest, largest and most 
established insectary in North America, Rincon-Vitova is also the most 
efficient producer of the dozen species of insects that it rears and sells. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are some of the best producers of beneficial insects in the 
country," Norlund said, "but it's still not the type of technology that you 
need to produce the numbers of beneficials that it will require to replace a 
significant amount of insecticide." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's enough to give Rincon-Vitova customers in all 50 states and six 
foreign countries and to generate more than $1 million in sales for the company 
annually -- a good chunk of a market that's estimated at $25 million worldwide. 
That figure would be larger, but for the Soviet Union and China, where 
biological control is a government, rather than a private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA and the California Department of Food and Agriculture list 68 
suppliers of beneficial organisms in 19 states and Canada. California is atop 
the insect heap, with 29 of those enterprises. Texas is next with five. 
</P>
<P>
"California is a pretty progressive state," said Jake Blehm, Rincon-Vitova's 
vice president for marketing and communications. "There isn't a farmer here who 
doesn't know what biological control is. But there are a lot of places in the 
country where they don't have an inkling, the middle-aged farmers who started 
during the chemical era when pesticides were wonder drugs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bug Shortages 
</P>
<P>
Still, in the past several years, grocery shoppers have clamored for 
pesticide-free produce like never before, and many farmers have responded by 
kicking their chemical habits and buying beneficial bugs from insectaries such 
as Rincon-Vitova. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had a predatory mite shortage because of demand from strawberry 
growers," Blehm said. "We've also had lacewing shortages. We had to quit taking 
orders in June, July and late May." 
</P>
<P>
A lack of ladybugs has also been a problem since 1987, Blehm said, but only in 
part because of consumer demand. Ladybugs -- the aphid-eating Hippodamia 
convergens -- do not reproduce well enough on a synthetic diet to make them 
economical to rear. 
</P>
<P>
So suppliers depend on roving bands of bug-pickers who trek through the High 
Sierra in search of the orange-and-black insects. Hippodamia convergens 
hibernate through the California winters in inches-thick beds at the base of 
pine trees, hidden beneath layers of dead leaves and pine needles. Harvesters 
scoop them up and sell them to suppliers such as Rincon-Vitova and Fountain's 
Sierra Bug Co., which is based in Rough and Ready, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladybugs are getting so scarce, you can't get enough to keep people happy," 
said H. H. Fountain, the company's owner. "From 1974 to 1977, we sold three to 
four times as many bugs as we do now. There were a lot more bugs to be had to 
begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Forest fires, logging and urban encroachment are the major culprits in the 
ladybug shortage, Fountain said. "Loggers tear the beds up completely to where 
the bugs won't come back," he mourned. "Forest fires will burn them out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Needed 
</P>
<P>
And then there's research support -- or the lack thereof. An estimated $450 
million in mostly private funding is spent each year on research and 
development for chemical pesticides, according to Kenneth Cook, director of a 
Washington-based environmental research group called the Center for Research 
Economics. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said, the USDA spends only about $20 million each year on 
biological control research. Concern is so great that a recent National Academy 
of Sciences study called for an additional $40 million annually to be spent on 
research into alternative methods of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"Biological control has been seriously neglected," Cook said. "The $20 million 
is an optimistic number. The potential has not nearly been exploited. When you 
look at pesticides, which are ranked by the Environmental Protection Agency as 
one of the great health risks, it's really ludicrous that we're spending as 
little as we are on biological control." 
</P>
<P>
Hoy of UC Berkeley has spent years breeding an improved strain of predatory 
mites -- beneficial bugs that clear fields of pest mites. While she has shared 
the better bugs with commercial insectaries, she said there is far too little 
of that give and take. As a result, Hoy said, it's tough to get new bugs from 
the lab to the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, you have to convince someone that it's going to work and that 
it's worth their while to learn how to use it and mass rear and sell it," she 
said. "The transfer of information from researcher to consumer is really 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Adding such problems as the ladybug shortage and the dearth of research support 
to the sheer drudgery of insect rearing, makes it easy to see why there aren't 
more producing insectaries. For not only must insect breeders rear beneficial 
insects, they often must rear the pests, too, to give the beneficials something 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising," Blehm said. "Probably 75% of the time, effort, labor and 
resources goes to rearing host insects. We could get rid of 75% of our space if 
we didn't have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
It's not unlike feeding humans, he said, whereby it takes expanses such as 
Kansas and Nebraska to sustain an island such as Manhattan. Rincon-Vitova sells 
fly parasites, so it has to breed common houseflies. The company sells 
lacewings, so it has to breed a moth called sitotroga, too. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had a reliable source for insects," Blehm said, "we'd get out of 
production and go entirely into retail and consulting. That's the neat part of 
the business. The growing part is the drudgery. But at this point in time, we 
haven't found anyone as reliable as we are." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 THE LADYBUG 
</P>
<P>
Also called ladybird, it was introduced in California in the late 19th Century 
to help save the fruit crop from a scale infestation. Since 1987, the bugs have 
been growing scarce as habitats and breeding grounds disappear. 
</P>
<P>
2 DIET 
</P>
<P>
Feeds chiefly on aphids 
</P>
<P>
and scale insects. Does not 
</P>
<P>
reproduce well on a synthetic diet. 
</P>
<P>
3 THE FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
A small round beetle, usually bright red or yellow with black, red, white or 
yellow spots. Belongs to the order Coleoptera and make up the family 
Coccinellidae. There are about 150 species. 
</P>
<P>
4 LIFE CYCLE 
</P>
<P>
Ladybugs hibernate through the winter by crawling under pine needles and 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CRYPTOLAEMUS 
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Mealybug Destroyer." An Australian import and member of the 
ladybug family, adults are black with orange head and tail. 
</P>
<P>
PREDATORY MITES 
</P>
<P>
Beneficial varieties feed on pest mites, consuming between 5 and 20 mites -- or 
their eggs -- a day. Adults are orange with a pear-shaped body. 
</P>
<P>
GREEN LACEWING 
</P>
<P>
A voracious predator that feeds on virtually any soft-bodied insect. Adults are 
a delicate green and about three-quarters of an inch long. 
</P>

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: DAVIS FAMILY HASN'T LOST ITS TASTE FOR TAKEOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Crudele, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without the Davis family, things would have been very boring on Wall Street 
these past few months. Marvin Davis, the Los Angeles investor and oil man, 
tried and failed to acquire both NWA Inc. and UAL Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Both airline companies are being acquired by someone else, but Davis' forays 
have made money for him and for traders on Wall Street who would have spent the 
summer doing crossword puzzles had it not been for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Last week I asked John Davis, Marvin's older son and partner, if the family 
thought that the economic environment was still favorable for attempting 
takeovers. I would have asked Marvin himself, but he doesn't talk to the press. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some opportunities we still see in this country," says John Davis, 
who thinks an economic slowdown that would make doing deals risky probably 
won't begin for 12 to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the slowdown starts, Davis says, his family may keep their takeover 
machine running by stepping into situations where previously accomplished 
leveraged buyouts are failing. Davis, of course, wouldn't be specific as to 
what companies, or even industries, that the clan is looking at. 
</P>
<P>
And, Davis says, Europe could offer some opportunities. Some European 
conglomerates, he says, "are not rationalized as efficiently as U.S. 
companies." Take as an example BAT Industries PLC, which is being forced to 
sell its retail operation, Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Davis says, "there are different obstacles, but different 
opportunities." Davis claims that he's looking at certain situations in Europe, 
but hasn't yet decided to act. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me like Europe is where the U.S. was in 1980 in terms of 
inefficient conglomerates that could better realize their economic potential as 
individual business units instead of diversified, unrelated groupings of 
companies," says Davis. 
</P>
<P>
On a more controversial matter, Davis says his family was "absolutely" serious 
about wanting to acquire NWA and UAL, despite critics saying Marvin Davis was 
simply trying to force NWA and UAL stocks higher so that he could add to his 
billions. 
</P>
<P>
John Davis says they had followed the airlines for two years and determined 
that the industry, and particularly those two companies, had good prospects for 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
If so, are there any other airlines in the Davis' future? "I'm not sure what we 
are going to do. We took a shot on the two most attractive properties," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The roar of Harley-Davidson's stock the past two weeks could have drowned out 
the sound of one of its famous motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of Harley-Davidson were selling at slightly over $30 at the end of 
August. But this week the stock breached the $40 mark as trading soared to 10 
times its normal level. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad that the takeover rumors that caused the increased trading activity 
probably aren't true. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has been knocking on our door," Harley president Richard Teerlink told 
me. He adds that his company isn't interested in being acquired, and "we have 
all the appropriate takeover defenses." 
</P>
<P>
The main rumor stirring up the situation was that Ford Motor wanted to acquire 
Harley-Davidson. Ford wasn't commenting, but executives at Harley, which is 
based in Milwaukee, were quickly and quietly telling Wall Street analysts that 
there was no truth to the gossip. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't like that rumor, there was another one -- a standby, so to speak. 
Harris Associates, a Chicago investment firm that already owns nearly 13% of 
Harley, was said to be buying more stock. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Harris was adding to its holdings, and its president Roger Brown 
wouldn't comment, it doesn't mean that Harley is being chased by a shark. 
Harris Associates has never attempted a hostile takeover, and sources say the 
investment firm is so meek that it calls Harley executives any time it buys 
more stock. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in Harris' background to indicate they are hostile," says 
Teerlink. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Harley isn't going to be acquired, there may be another compelling 
reason why its stock should be going up. 
</P>
<P>
Harley, the only major American manufacturer of motorcycles, is doing 
unbelievably well in a business that once was nearly monopolized by foreign 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Brown of Harris is one of the stock's biggest boosters. He's been buying shares 
regularly for months and his representatives have had meetings with Harley's 
chairman, Vaughn Beals, and Teerlink. "We like the management and the value we 
see in the stock," is about all that Brown will say. "We're always cordial. 
They are very talented people." 
</P>
<P>
Beals and Teerlink have other admirers on Wall Street. Recently, two brokerage 
firms, Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee and Dean Witter Reynolds, spoke glowingly 
of Harley. Daniel Kapusta, the analyst at Baird, says he sees Harley's stock 
climbing to between $48 and $51 a share within the next year. "On a fundamental 
basis, the stock looked cheap for a long time," says Kapusta. 
</P>
<P>
Harley's business is "fantastic," says Kapusta. "We think they will have record 
earnings this year." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are estimating that Harley's earnings could reach $4 a share this 
year, easily topping 1988's record of $3.41 a share. And in 1990, profits could 
rise a full dollar to $5 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Probably more important, say the experts, is the fact that demographics are 
working in Harley's favor. As the nation's population ages, the number of men 
in their upper 30s who can afford to indulge in motorcycles is growing. And 
that's the biggest market for the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
And the loyalty of Harley's customers, the experts say, is unparalleled. "Do 
you know any other company where customers tattoo the name of the company on 
their body?" asks one expert. 
</P>
<P>
Harley's only problem, it seems, is the takeover rumors. Not that the rumors 
will come true. That's not the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem is what will happen to Harley's stock a few weeks from now 
when the rumors don't pan out and Harley becomes just another company that's 
doing well. 
</P>
<P>
Investors had better be wearing their helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Is F. W. Woolworth Co. really a takeover candidate? The gossip around Wall 
Street last week was that some raider was about to go after the downscale 
retailing chain. But several smart traders -- the type who won't buy a stock 
unless a rumor makes sense to them -- were wondering out loud why anyone would 
go after a retailer like Woolworth when chains like Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth 
Avenue and Marshall Field's are up for grabs . . .

BRUCE HOROVITZ' STORY ON MINORITIES IN PUBLIC RELATIONS SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED 
ALL COLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about a misleading headline. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruce Horovitz column didn't address what it promised: an up-to-date report 
on the industry's quest to improve employment opportunities for 
under-represented ethnic groups in communications. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, Horovitz writes about the challenges facing "minority" public 
relations practitioners and focuses almost exclusively on the black experience. 
While we applaud such reporting efforts and agree with the observations made by 
the black professionals who were quoted, we must take issue with Horovitz' 
definition of "minority." 
</P>
<P>
Why did Horovitz neglect to interview professionals from other 
under-represented groups, in particular Latinos or Asians who make up two 
significant minority populations in Los Angeles? Certainly it is not for lack 
of sources, such as the Hispanic Public Relations Assn., which has been "doing 
something about the 'unmentionable' problem of jobs for minorities" for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
As the most influential newspaper on the West Coast, many look to The Times to 
provide an accurate portrayal of the challenges facing L.A., the nation's most 
ethnically diverse major city. Please broaden your definition to include other 
points of view.

MAJOR ISSUES BEFORE THE PUC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission, supported by 1,070 employees and a 
budget of $70 million, is charged by the state constitution with regulating 
investor-owned utilities and truckers, companies that generate $40 billion a 
year in products and services. 
</P>
<P>
The governor appoints the five commissioners, who must be approved by the 
California Senate before serving staggered six-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission gets an incredible array of issues," says Terry L. Moore, 
director of the PUC division of ratepayer advocates. For example, commissioners 
recently deciided to allow a "wine train" to haul tourists through Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the major issues pending: 
</P>
<P>
Telephone Service 
</P>
<P>
Adopt an "incentive-based" regulatory system governing Pacific Bell and GTE 
California. Approval expected this month with system to take effect Jan. 1, 
1990, but some delay in implementation may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
A final phase in the phone companies' regulatory overhaul will be completed 
next year as the PUC sets new prices for each telephone service covered by the 
new regulatory framework. It will also consider enlarging the size of the local 
calling area, currently 8 miles, and eliminating the 20-year-old monthly charge 
of $1.20 for "Touch Tone" telephones. It also will consider rules to improve 
and simplify service on privately owned pay phones and to resolve complaints of 
uncompetitive practices by local phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
Gas and Electricity 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas rates to be adjusted, probably upward, effective Jan. 
1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Major rate case, first in three years, to be decided for Pacific Gas &amp; 
Electric. Most contentious issue: Allocation of construction costs for Diablo 
Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo based on a formula approved 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of one or more new pipelines to bring more natural gas into the state. 
</P>
<P>
Revision of gas-pricing formula that seeks to keep major gas customers from 
switching fuels. 
</P>
<P>
First of what will be a biennial assessment of California's electrical needs. 
</P>
<P>
Decision due by end of 1990 on controversial proposed merger of Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. Federal approval is also 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Trucking 
</P>
<P>
Revision of freight-hauling rules and price setting, seeking to improve 
competition and stability in trucking while avoiding both minimum rates and 
predatory pricing. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous 
</P>
<P>
The PUC sets rates for investor-owned water districts, which deliver nearly a 
quarter of residential supplies. 
</P>
<P>
It also sets prices for ferry travel, and has before it a controversial 
proposal to merge two presently competing San Francisco companies, Red &amp; 
White Fleet and Blue &amp; Gold, which provide commuter service as well as 
tourist excursions on San Francisco Bay. BRUCE KEPPEL

INCENTIVE-BASED RATE PLAN TAKES PHASED APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission is expected this month to adopt an 
incentive-based system for regulating Pacific Bell and GTE California. As 
proposed, effective Jan. 1, the system would: 
</P>
<P>
* Cut phone rates next year and then peg them in future years to a 
cost-adjustment formula. This formula would limit price increases to the rate 
of overall inflation minus 4% for assumed efficiencies due to cost-cutting and 
labor-saving technology. Thus, in a year in which the cost of living increased 
5%, telephone prices should rise no more than 1%. If inflation rose less than 
4%, phone prices would actually be cut. 
</P>
<P>
* Reorganize regulation so that the PUC still would set rates for basic phone 
service, which on the local level remains a monopoly. Prices for most optional 
calling features would be capped, but the companies would be allowed to lower 
charges, within limits, if they wished to encourage usage. Prices would be 
deregulated for such services as yellow pages advertising where competitive 
alternatives already exist. 
</P>
<P>
* Authorize the PUC, as part of its rate-setting procedure, to establish a 
target rate of return for the phone companies. For 1990, that rate would be 
11.75%. As an incentive to improve efficiency, the companies could keep all 
profits for another percentage point, but earnings in excess of 12.75% would be 
split evenly between customers and the company. Earnings exceeding a 16.75% 
return would be refunded. For phone customers, the refunds would come as 
credits in future bills. 
</P>
<P>
In a final phase of the regulatory revision to be completed next year, the 
proposal calls for the commission to revise all telephone rates to reflect the 
new system. This "rate design" phase would eliminate the bewildering array of 
credits and surcharges applied to customers bills. At that time, the proposal 
recommends that the PUC scrap a 20-year-old $1.20 monthly fee for "Touch Tone" 
service and also expand the local service area in which unlimited calls can be 
made at no extra charge from 8 miles to 12 miles. BRUCE KEPPEL

GORBACHEV'S SUCCESS IS IN U.S. INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Arthur Macy Cox, Arthur Macy Cox, a former diplomat and CIA official, is 
secretary of the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reaction of the Bush Administration to the Gorbachev revolution has 
vacillated between stunned disbelief and grudging approval. The most repeated 
expression is "prudent caution." This is astounding, because Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev has already fulfilled the Cold War goals of the United States and 
gives promise of moving to levels of freedom and democracy beyond our wildest 
expectations. It is contrary to U.S. interests that Gorbachev should fail or be 
replaced, yet President George Bush has not made the decision to assist him 
actively. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Tetons subsummit meeting may have ended the foot-dragging on 
disarmament, because the agreement to hold the first Bush-Gorbachev summit in 
mid-1990 will provide incentive for action in both conventional and strategic 
force negotiations. Yet a strange reluctance persists -- to acknowledge that 
mutual verified disarmament is as much in U.S. interests as the Soviets'. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger's recent speech (Opinion, 
Sept. 24) -- crafted with White House approval -- reflects the confusion within 
the Administration. Eagleburger said we should stick to the policies of the 
past 40 years until the Gorbachev reforms become irreversible. He said U.S. 
policies should be devised to serve our interests, whether Gorbachev succeeds 
or fails. This boggling conclusion demonstrates that the Bush Administration 
has not made up its collective mind -- unlike Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who are both 
enthusiastic supporters of Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Such timidity in lending support represents the counsel of disaster. Gorbachev 
is leader of democratic reform in the East and if he is toppled the chances for 
those reforms probably will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Now it may be that some of the Bush Administration's caution is inspired by the 
right wing of the Republican Party. There are politicians and pundits who hope 
Gorbachev will be overthrown and the Soviet system replaced by capitalism. Some 
would like to see a civil war between the various nationalities because that 
might hasten the collapse of the Soviet government. Others believe the Soviet 
economy is so weak that the United States should pursue a policy of unrelenting 
pressure for ever more concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Bush Administration recognizes that these positions are naive, 
because the alternative to Gorbachev -- rather than democracy and capitalism -- 
is likely to be totalitarians of the right or left. The Bush Administration has 
been careful not to undermine Gorbachev. In fact, during Boris N. Yeltsin's 
recent visit, the White House decided not to grant photo opportunities for fear 
of offending Gorbachev. Bush says he wants to end the Cold War and move beyond 
containment. He says he wishes Gorbachev well and hopes his perestroika will 
succeed. But he goes on to say that there is little the United States can do to 
help. Either the President is badly briefed or he is less than candid. For the 
United States can help Gorbachev enormously while also helping itself. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev wants to disarm rapidly. He wants to cut his defense budget 50% by 
1995, and another 50% by the end of the decade. He wants to demilitarize 
competition with the West to eliminate the possibility of war, and he also 
needs the resources that would become available for consumer production. Since 
he is already in the process of a 14% cut in defense, why doesn't he make the 
full 50% reduction by unilateral action? The answer to that is key to 
understanding the process of the Gorbachev revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has been performing an amazing political balancing act. His goal has 
been to restructure Soviet society while eliminating the totalitarian forces of 
Stalinism and neo-Stalinism. Given the entrenched bureaucracy, the odds against 
Gorbachev were immense. But after only 4 1/2 years we see almost unbelievable 
progress. All the neo-Stalinists and most of the orthodox Marxist-Leninists 
have been eliminated from the Politburo and the Communist Party secretariat. 
The remaining hard-liners in the Central Committee are expected to be removed 
at next year's party congress. In February or March of 1990, elections for 
local soviets -- bodies to run day-to-day affairs -- will be held with multiple 
candidates and secret ballots. Observers anticipate that most of the rascals -- 
meaning the party hacks -- will be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
The new Congress of Peoples Deputies and its operating arm, the new Supreme 
Soviet, includes among its elected members the greatest dissident, Andrei D. 
Sakharov, and Yeltsin, who was fired from the Politburo by Gorbachev. Both 
Sakharov and Yeltsin, though supporters of Gorbachev, have made private trips 
to the United States where they criticized Gorbachev for holding too much power 
and moving too slowly with reforms. This summer, five deputies from the Supreme 
Soviet spent a month with members of the U.S. Congress and their staffs, 
learning about legislative procedures -- especially voting processes, the Ways 
and Means Committee, the Intelligence Oversight Committees and the General 
Accounting Office. A minority block of the Soviet Peoples Deputies is 
supporting pluralism in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of Stalinist repression on non-Russian nationalities has uncovered 
smoldering ethnic hostility and demands for national autonomy. In the Baltic 
states, the demands are for national independence. The nationalities problem is 
certain to join production of consumer goods as Gorbachev's greatest challenge. 
He will very likely move to a federal system, granting wide autonomy to the 
national republics. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign policy, Gorbachev has withdrawn from Afghanistan, rejecting further 
expansionism plus renouncing the theories of class struggle and military 
support for liberation movements. He has removed Marxist-Leninist ideology from 
Soviet foreign policy -- tolerating the formation of a non-communist government 
in Poland and the emergence of political pluralism in Hungary. He has been 
critical of neo-Stalinism in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
All this has been accomplished while facing the risk of losing his balance. 
Some say Gorbachev has moved too fast, others too slow. Some say Gorbachev is 
the greatest politician-statesman since World War II. Certainly what has 
happened so far is clearly in the interest of the United States. But Gorbachev 
cannot go much further with unilateral disarmament and remain in power. Even 
his supporters in the military and KGB would oppose such action. No Western 
power would disarm unilaterally. There has to be reciprocity; disarmament that 
can be reliably verified is just as much in the interest of the United States 
as the Soviet Union. The savings will do wonders for the U.S. deficit, and our 
security will be enhanced. 
</P>

A major benefit will accrue to both the United States and the Soviet Union from 
disarmament: the freeing of scientific and technological brainpower. The 
Pentagon and the Department of Energy have employed many of the best U.S. 
scientists for military research and development. From 1981 to 1988, the 
Pentagon more than doubled its spending in universities and research 
laboratories. An important reason the Japanese have acquired such an advantage 
in certain consumer areas has been the diversion of so much U.S. technology to 
defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has suggested joint talks between leaders of the military-industrial 
complexes of both nations about the details of converting military plants to 
civilian production. This is an important area where the United States can 
provide advice. The process of conversion will be more difficult for the 
Soviets because their military plants don't have experience with civilian 
production, compared with large U.S. military producers such as General 
Electric and Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
The major assistance the United States can provide for Gorbachev will result 
from increasing the pace of disarmament, but the Soviet Union also needs U.S. 
technical assistance and technology in everything from agricultural to tourism. 
Further, the United States should liberalize its export-licensing policy, 
limiting controls only to goods and technology with clear military application. 
Restrictions on immigration from the Soviet Union have been removed, so the 
President should use his authority to grant most favored nations tariff status. 
Bush should act now to help Gorbachev survive and succeed.

WILL CONGRESS AT LAST LEGISLATE FOR CHILD-CARE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW HAVEN, CONN. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study now confirms what we, and our grandmothers, have known all along: 
Children who are unsupervised after school are more likely to get into trouble. 
And these days, trouble means drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Latchkey children are twice as likely to use marijuana, alcohol and cigarettes 
as are children cared for by adults after school, according to a USC study 
involving 5,000 eighth-graders in Los Angeles and San Diego, published in the 
September issue of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between regular self-care (11 hours per week or more) and 
substance abuse holds true regardless of other circumstances such as family 
income, number of parents in the household, the child's extracurricular 
activities or involvement in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Here we have a strategic opportunity in the national war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
If the estimated 13 million latchkey children under the age of 14 in the United 
States were enrolled in extended-day programs at school, or in supervised 
after-school recreational activities, then early drug use among teen-agers 
could be significantly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is already working on a variety of solutions to the latchkey 
problem. Just recently, the City Council voted to spend $4.5 million in city 
funds to extend the hours of the Los Angeles Unified School District's regular 
after-school recreation program from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m. every afternoon in all 
306 elementary and junior high schools located within the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
This open -- but supervised -- program is free, for all students who attend 
city schools or live in the school neighborhoods. Attendance, somewhat 
complicated by busing, averages 30,000 students at a cost of about $265 per 
child for the school year. 
</P>
<P>
Several smaller, more expensive programs, with students formally "enrolled," 
are run by the Los Angeles district in 121 locations in or very near school 
buildings. Parents pay fees calculated on a sliding scale. Fee subsidies come 
from a variety of sources: state money, city money, even a $500,000 grant from 
a local corporation -- Kaiser Permanente -- for the blue-ribbon mayor's 
program. 
</P>
<P>
While the nationwide number of children still unsupervised after school 
presents a continuing challenge, Los Angeles shows strong resolve in testing a 
number of solutions simultaneously while using creative funding strategies. A 
similar resolve must be shown on the national policy level. 
</P>
<P>
At the national level, concern for the needs of school-age children cannot be 
separated from the equally important developmental needs of infants, toddlers 
and preschool children of parents who work. A strong national child-care policy 
must give all children access to high quality, age-appropriate care while their 
parents are at work. 
</P>
<P>
Three child-care bills are now pending in Congress. Thanks to the leadership of 
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Education and Labor 
Committee, the two bills under consideration in the House of Representatives 
include provisions for school-age child care. 
</P>
<P>
Title II of HR 3, sponsored by Hawkins, allocates 25% of an estimated $1.78 
billion national outlay to year-round school-based care for preschoolers and 
school children up to the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, HR 3 expands Head Start to full daytime hours all year and opens 
the program to families with incomes higher than the qualifying level on a 
fee-paying basis. With this change, Head Start would finally become integrated 
across socioeconomic class lines, a bonus for the children. HR 3 also: expands 
the supply of infant and toddler day care through subsidies to providers; helps 
states coordinate local training, monitoring and referral programs, and makes 
provisions to enhance corporate support of child care. 
</P>
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee is working on a $1.85-billion bill for child 
care that adopts most of the HR 3 measures as reported out of the Education and 
Labor Committee -- including latchkey care -- but omits funding of infant and 
toddler care. Instead, in an effort to help families as directly as possible 
with the cost of child care, the Ways and Means bill increases the Dependent 
Care Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, and -- along the lines of 
President Bush's preferred child-care plan -- makes the Dependent Care Tax 
Credit refundable so that poorer families with little tax liability can reap 
some benefit as well. In the Ways and Means version, Title XX of the Social 
Services Block Grants to individual states would also be increased by a 
designated amount -- now set at $350 million -- specifically earmarked for 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
A third piece of legislation, the Senate's Act for Better Child-Care Services, 
or ABC bill, sponsored by Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Orrin G. Hatch 
(R-Utah), was passed by the Senate in June. At $1.75 billion, it combines tax 
credits with subsidies to low-income families to help them pay for child care. 
Although the bill does not mandate minimum standards or training for providers, 
it encourages states to adopt these measures. More than anyone, Rep. George 
Miller (D-Martinez) has championed standards of quality in child care and can 
be credited with keeping this important issue alive. 
</P>
<P>
In evaluating these bills, look for what is best for children -- for their 
healthy growth and development. We are interested in quality, because child 
care doesn't help children unless it's good care. Every day in this country, 
hundreds of thousands of children are left in situations that are only 
detrimental to their well-being. 
</P>
<P>
In a national child-care policy, we want to see provisions to help low-income 
families pay for quality child care. Money is the issue: There is a direct 
relationship between the cost of child care and the quality of child care. All 
three bills work to put money for child care in the hands of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The best legislation would contain the best elements of all three bills. The 
Senate bill leads the way in setting standards of quality. The needs of 
school-age children, often ignored in discussions of child care, are best 
addressed in the two House bills. 
</P>
<P>
We especially like the provision in the House bills for the use of neighborhood 
school buildings for child care, and for the expansion of Head Start. Every 
latchkey child under the age of 14 should be given proper adult care before and 
after school and during school vacations. 
</P>
<P>
It has been almost 20 years since the last child-care bill made it to the 
President's desk, in 1971, only to be vetoed. What we need now is a bill that 
can form the foundation for an evolving national child-care policy. In signing 
such a bill into law, President Bush will honor two of his most important 
promises: to fight the war on drugs and to bring forth a kinder, gentler 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive child-care does both. It is time.

NO-FAULT AUTO INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Take Another Stab at No-Fault" (Sept. 24) may have given some 
readers the impression that when Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) dropped no-fault from his auto insurance bill (AB 2315), this 
stopped work on my no-fault bill (AB 354). While it is true the Speaker grafted 
some of the basic no-fault provisions from my bill onto his bill before he 
asked the Assembly to pass it, once in the Senate the no-fault amendments were 
quickly removed. 
</P>
<P>
Although my bill stalled this year, it is still very much alive. I intend to 
ask for a hearing on it in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee next January. 
</P>
<P>
AB 354 provides a basic no-frills no-fault policy at affordable rates for all 
Californians and allows those with more at risk to buy the coverage they need. 
The sponsors of the bill, Consumers Union, nonprofit publishers of Consumer 
Reports, and the minority and low-income coalition, including Latino Issues 
Forum and Public Advocates, have been joined by the more far-thinking insurance 
companies, who realize that only pro-consumer no-fault has the slightest chance 
of appealing to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' continued support for good no-fault is encouraging.

GOODMAN ON BARNEY FRANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an ordinary citizen, I am insulted and outraged by the remarks in Morton 
Kondracke's column ("Lynch Mob Should Quit, Not Barney," Op-Ed Page, Sept. 25) 
about the virtues of Barney Frank, whom he described as a "national treasure 
that should be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
This esteemed congressman solicited, paid, used and harbored a male prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Most people would be jailed for this kind of activity, but instead Rep. Frank 
is extolled and defended by a columnist in The Times as if he were 
indispensable to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
If Frank is a "national treasure," then the legislative branch is in Chapter 
11.

NO-FAULT AUTO INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your points about the obviously essential no-fault insurance were well made but 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 carried because, as someone said, if you promise to rob Peter 
to pay Paul you bet you can count on the support of Paul. We have closely 
watched the development of Proposition 103, had both side speak to us, and see 
no benefit in it. The numbers just do not exist as the Voter Revolt people say 
they do. When questioned about their assertions the 103 side always immediately 
changed the subject, especially away from tort reform. In our estimation 
Proposition 103 was a preemptive strike to delay law (tort) reform, the 
regulation of lawyers, and postpone the loss of their incomes. They should own 
up to that now instead of trying to excuse themselves after 70% of drivers get 
bigger insurance bills (more if you are military dependents). 
</P>
<P>
No-fault is part of the answer but unless there is some independent regulation 
(and that does not mean the State Bar which is no more than a price-fixing 
ring) over lawyers, their incompetence, and their extortionist rates, this 
upward spiral of insurance rates, in which they play such a large part, is just 
beginning. Also, why under Proposition 103 should traffic tickets that do not 
generate insurance claims be a factor on which insurance companies must base 
their rates? 
</P>
<P>
Two years on, the feeling is that somebody who knows something about insurance 
is urgently needed somewhere in this process. Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and 
Speaker Brown have shown us that they don't qualify. Every lawyer who speaks, 
from Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp to Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, 
sings the same silly songs while making an ever-more feathery bed for their 
fellow lawyers at our expense. Any lawyer who stands for insurance commissioner 
will not get much support.

GOODMAN ON BARNEY FRANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ellen Goodman's "Oil Slick Is Starting to Cover Barney and It Doesn't Scrub 
Off," (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 21) doesn't wash. Comparing Massachusetts Democratic 
Rep. Barney Frank to an innocent coastline smeared by a mean oil slick is 
nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
Barney Frank, who made a career out of moralistic preaching against ethical 
misbehavior among the Republicans, is not an innocent bystander. He solicited 
the troubled brew in which he now flounders. 
</P>
<P>
Frank has done a disservice to his constituents, to his party, to the House of 
Representatives, and to the cause of responsible government to which he claimed 
to be loyal for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank will be remembered, not for the causes he served, but for the 
foolish mistakes in his private life. 
</P>
<P>
One can only hope that other men and women in public life will learn from his 
misfortune.

A SUFFERING HUMANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A survey of global health has concluded that a billion people -- one in five -- 
are diseased, in poor health or malnourished, according to the United Nations 
World Health Organization. The report underscores the importance of a greater 
commitment to public health, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a preventable tragedy because the developed world has the resources 
and technology to end common diseases worldwide, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO 
director general, commented. "The missing ingredient is the will to help the 
developing countries. Simply, the rich countries must transfer technology, 
health manpower and money because the poorest countries can't help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Health expenditures in the poorest nations average $5 per capita compared with 
$400 or more in the industrialized nations of the West. An increase of as 
little as $2 per person would cover the cost of global child immunization and 
remedies for many of the most prevalent diseases, including diarrheal and acute 
respiratory infections, tuberculosis, malaria, schistosomiasis and sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Some 60% of the world's children are now vaccinated against polio, tetanus, 
measles, diphtheria, pertussis and tuberculosis, but the diseases still kill 
almost 3 million children each year. Oral rehydration therapy to reduce the 
risk of death from diarrheal infection has been adopted by public health 
services in most nations, but the therapy still only reaches about one-third of 
the children at risk. Pneumonia kills an estimated 4 million children a year 
because they do not have access to the inexpensive antibiotic treatment that 
could save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the problems are focused in the developing nations alone. The spread 
of sexually transmitted diseases in developed industrialized nations, notably 
the United States, has been dramatized in recent reports. It is now estimated 
that 5% of teen-agers and young adults worldwide contract a sexually 
transmitted disease each year. Gonorrhea, syphilis, chancroid, chlamydia, 
genital warts and two incurable diseases, genital herpes and acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are increasing in many regions of the world, 
"aggravated by the greater mobility of populations and the breakdown in 
traditional mores, increasingly leading to multiple sex partners," according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Malaria remains a major scourge in 100 nations of the world, with no progress 
evident. Half the world's population is at risk from it. In 76 developing 
nations, schistosomiasis, a debilitating tropical disease spread by water-borne 
parasites, afflicts an estimated 200 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Nakajima notes in his report the progress that has been made: Smallpox has been 
eliminated, and polio is likely to be eradicated by the end of the century. But 
he prefers, quite correctly, to focus on what needs to be done, not on what has 
already been done. "We cannot rest on our laurels, waiting for things to 
change," he said. "We need to act now."

President Bush's proposal to give tax incentives to parents who adopt the 
mentally retarded has gone largely unnoticed; it needs serious thought, but 
only once. 
</P>
<P>
Adults who care for children -- be they disabled or otherwise -- do so because 
they want to, not because of financial incentives. There are already tax 
incentives for parents with children, yet couples do not say: "Gee, honey, we 
need another deduction next year, let's have a kid!" Similarly, those that want 
to adopt a mentally retarded child will do so regardless of any short-term 
incentive. Instead, the incentive will open the door for exploitation by those 
who would only consider adoption for the monetary benefits. Those who abuse and 
exploit children will be encouraged to adopt for financial gain. They are not 
the type of parents that we need. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayer dollars would be more successfully spent on medical care, birth 
control, education and prenatal care. Studies continue to show that for every 
dollar of prenatal care that is spent, many times that amount is saved 
postnatally. Yet public health funding continues to decline. The mentally 
retarded and all other Americans would be better served if the education and 
medical fields were better funded. 
</P>
<P>
Let's encourage better, healthier lives for all children and continue to be 
selective about who is privileged enough to adopt. A majority of mentally 
retarded births are not preventable, but abuse of the system and abuse of the 
children are.

ERMA BOMBECK: BEING LATE CAN GIVE YOU A REAL RUSH

The kid's plane left at 11:30 a.m. Hold that number in your mind. The airport 
is 30 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:15, he was playing tennis. At 10:30, he put a load of his clothes in the 
dryer. At 10:40, he was in the shower washing his hair. At 10:55, he was on the 
phone talking to a friend with the relaxation of a man just after surgery. At 
11:05, he was going through every room in the house looking for his airline 
ticket and sunglasses. He left at 11:08, confident that all the traffic lights 
would be green and the plane would be 30 minutes late in leaving. 
</P>
<P>
He is youth, a part of society that never suffers from an anxiety attack. He is 
a carrier who spreads the condition to everyone within a radius of 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
I must have had a time in my life when I honestly believed I would never have a 
flat tire on the way to the airport. I would never need a raincoat on a 
vacation. I would never need a safety pin at my wedding. If there was, I can't 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
Just being around kids who never plan, never anticipate and never sweat drives 
me crazy. Don't ask me why, but I freak out when I hear one of them on the 
phone at 9 o'clock at night ask, "What do you want to do?" When I am tired and 
want to go to bed and sleep, they have some nerve flaunting the energy to do 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
My children accuse me of planning my next headache. It's true. I'm an organized 
person. I read movie reviews to see if I should take extra nose tissue along to 
mop up. I never enter a taxicab without remembering the driver only carries 
under $10 worth of change. Whenever I have to make a left-hand turn, I leave 
the house early.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: WILDLIFE TRAGEDY UNFOLDING IN ALASKA

<TEXT>
<P>
Our ship Alcyone sailed in a stiff wind across the Bering Sea to Round Island, 
site of the largest gathering of Pacific walruses in the northern oceans. More 
than 12,000 bulls stretched out along the rocks at the Alaska state sanctuary, 
their ivory tusks gleaming white against leathery brown faces. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, only native Eskimo people are 
permitted to hunt walrus, and no part of the animal can be wasted -- a 
provision that is entirely consistent with traditional Eskimo belief and 
practice. Only native Eskimo people can possess uncarved ivory. And the only 
ivory that can be legally sold is ivory they have carved. Trade in raw ivory is 
illegal for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the walrus may fall prey to pressures no one foresaw when the act 
was written in the early 1970s -- namely, the vulnerability of the native 
culture to outside influence, among them the drug trade. Already, there are 
reports of Eskimo people trading raw walrus tusks for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests have been made recently in Alaska involving the illegal selling and 
trading of walrus ivory for cocaine and marijuana. There have been reports of a 
single whole walrus skull, worth about $800 with tusks attached, being traded 
for six marijuana cigarettes; 10 walrus heads bring an ounce. Most grisly of 
all, the walrus heads are hacked off with a chain saw, the carcasses left 
headless -- not only violating the lives of the animals, but all rules, civil 
and traditional, against waste. 
</P>
<P>
In villages on the distant Bering Sea, walrus carving is a traditional art form 
of the Eskimo, and the walrus hunt a traditional form of sustenance. For 
centuries, the walrus has provided numerous staples -- meat for food, skin for 
leather and boat coverings, oil for fuel, even intestinal tissue for raincoats. 
And, of course, ivory for tools and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The temptations to illicitly harvest walrus ivory may worsen. This month, 
nations that are signatories to the Convention on International Trade of 
Endangered Species will meet to discuss a full-scale ban on trade in African 
elephant ivory. 
</P>
<P>
Although they detest walrus poaching, Eskimo carvers are concerned that 
attempts to control the problem may impinge on their traditional hunting and 
carving rights in a region where the walrus is a critical resource, not only 
for its products, but for the cash that ivory carvings can bring. 
</P>
<P>
On remote Little Diomede Island, one hunter and Eskimo carver, John Iyapana, 
told me, "We carve in nine months maybe $150,000 worth of ivory carving. You 
see all that ivory carving in the store? In the fire hall up there? All that 
ivory is taking care of us." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, Eskimos take roughly 1,700 walrus, according to an Alaska Department 
of Fish and Game bulletin. An equal number are killed or wounded by hunters, 
but are lost in the frigid waters. This means about 3,400 walrus are killed 
annually by Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Eskimo hunted walrus with harpoons, the harpoon head itself made from 
sharpened ivory. But today, walrus are mainly hunted by rifle. Indeed, some 
offenders have been found trading ivory for rifles, presumably to shoot more 
walrus for more ivory. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the Eskimo villages I visited, young people were torn between the 
world of their ancestors and the world of modern ways -- city ways that too 
often include drugs and quick money. Traditional culture competes against 
televisions, video games, designer jeans, alcohol and sheer boredom. 
</P>
<P>
At Little Diomede, I watched an elder work on an umiak, a walrus-skin boat that 
is as seaworthy as a Viking craft. Around him, children played basketball, 
oblivious to what he was doing. The skill will die with him, I thought, for the 
young see no reason to learn it. Under such conditions, the illegal walrus 
trade can prosper. 
</P>
<P>
It would be not only a wildlife tragedy, but a human one for the Eskimo people 
and all of us if, as the valve on ivory is properly closed off in Africa, 
another valve opens in Alaska.

ZAN THOMPSON: THE SUN HASN'T SET OVER FOLLY BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Folly Beach was my kind of beach: wide and flat. I could walk out into the 
ocean about a quarter of a mile and still not be up to my chin. The water was 
the temperature of a gentle, lukewarm shower. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that confused me about Folly Beach is that, for a California 
lady, the sun went down backwards -- over the land. 
</P>
<P>
It was about 20 years ago and we were in Folly Beach, S. C., in one of those 
sand-scoured beach houses in the dunes, a house that had the eternal fragrance 
of banana daiquiris, chili dogs, potato salad and corn chips. 
</P>
<P>
We were there to celebrate Bo's graduation from the Citadel, the oldest 
military college in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The beach house was full of Citadel graduates, laughing girls, my sister Patsy 
(Bo's mother) and Patsy's two daughters, Mandy and Muffy. 
</P>
<P>
The song of the season was "Leaving On a Jet Plane," and the last day, we all 
did, all heading in different directions. That was the last time we have all 
been together since. 
</P>
<P>
That summer weekend of sun and sand and Bo playing "Mr. Bojangles" on a mellow 
guitar are gone forever. And now, so is Folly Beach. But it will be back after 
months of agonizing, heartbreaking work. The low country breeds a strong genus 
but none of them has ever been through anything like Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
Bo told me that the aerial photos showed houses standing here and there but 
when the owners went to see them, their homes were hollow shells, totally 
gutted by the 135 m.p.h. winds and walls of water. 
</P>
<P>
Patsy lives in Beaufort on the Broad River, right at sea level and inland from 
the ocean about 10 rows of piney woods. 
</P>
<P>
When the governor of South Carolina gave the order for people in all the 
barrier islands and the low-lying towns to evacuate, Patsy and Mandy and 
Mandy's four children went to Bo's house, which is about a 2-hour drive away. 
What's important is that it's in Columbia, about 138 miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
They did superbly, mostly because they were together and didn't have to anguish 
about someone else. Of course, there were no telephones and no electric power. 
But Bo, ever steadfast, has a generator. So they had television, radio, a 
microwave -- all those things we are convinced we can't live without. They got 
full power back Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Charleston really was devastated, according to Bo and Patsy. 
</P>
<P>
Bo told me that the fine gourmet restaurants in Charleston cooked everything in 
their freezers and gave it to agencies feeding hungry homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
Patsy said, "It sounds like the biggest freight train you have ever heard 
thundering down on you. Then it becomes deadly still and you know you are in 
the eye. You hunker down and wait because you know it's coming through again. 
</P>
<P>
"After Hugo had passed by, it left wild weather. It was 80, hot and humid and 
then the temperature dropped 30 degrees in about an hour. I saw a television 
piece on a lady standing on a barrier island in a hole in the sand, She said, 
'I'm in my kitchen.' Really we had less trouble in Beaufort than in Columbia. 
When Mandy went back the day afterward, all that was destroyed was a couple of 
small tree limbs and some Spanish moss." 
</P>
<P>
Patsy and her family are in great shape and grateful to be able to talk about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
I talked to Mandy last night and she had been gathering and packing clothes to 
send to Charleston all day. The television shows us the havoc, but it is not 
like reaching your hand out to help someone who has nothing left but prayer and 
hope.

ON AGING: AT PLAY IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH-CARE COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By The UCLA/USC Long Term Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days, about the only thing you can count on in the health care-financing 
field is change. Plenty of it. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: When California Assemblyman Willie Brown (D- San Francisco) 
drafted state legislation in 1989 requiring small companies to provide health 
insurance for workers, he stipulated that the law would not take effect until 
1993. Why the lengthy delay? To give Congress time to enact a national 
health-insurance plan and thus render the Brown plan unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is not the only one anticipating change. With at least 35 million 
Americans uninsured and hospital and medical costs climbing at twice the rate 
of inflation, almost everyone -- from government decision makers to people on 
the street -- agrees that something must be done to improve our present 
health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flurry of Activity 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, there's been a flurry of activity at national and state levels to 
implement solutions. If enacted, any of the proposals described below could 
profoundly impact your health-insurance needs, although it's too early to 
predict exactly how. Here's what the future might hold: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Changes to the Medicare Catastrophic Act. In response to angry protests 
from some retirees opposed to paying higher taxes for expanded Medicare 
benefits, legislators have introduced more than 20 bills designed to amend, 
delay or repeal the catastrophic program. Among the amendments is a proposal 
that would allow Medicare beneficiaries to drop the catastrophic coverage by 
giving up all Medicare Part B (physician) benefits and one that would reduce 
the supplemental premium, a surtax ranging up to $800 for some seniors. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) 
oppose any changes to the act. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Prospective Payment for Doctors. A coalition of Democrats and 
Republicans, with tentative support from the Administration, is writing federal 
legislation that would limit the amount doctors could charge Medicare patients. 
The proposed legislation, which would take effect in 1991, includes a national 
fee scale for each procedure, service and operation performed by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare payments would be based on the fee scale, and doctors would be 
prohibited from charging more than 25 percent above the Medicare-approved 
amount. Although the proposed bill has broad congressional support, organized 
medicine vigorously opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A National Health Insurance Plan. What do Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, 
Princeton economist Uwe E. Reinhardt, a national physicians' group, and former 
Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon have in common? They all 
support some type of universal health-insurance plan to guarantee coverage for 
all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they have yet to agree on details. For example, should it be 
financed through existing funding sources, income and excise taxes, or new 
taxes on workers and businesses? 
</P>
<P>
 -- An Accounting of Future Obligations for Retiree Health-Care Insurance. 
Under a plan proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the nation's 
main accounting body, employers would be required to charge to their earnings 
the estimated future cost of retiree health-care insurance, a change that could 
drastically cut profits at some companies. Currently, employers report only 
what they pay out for health-care insurance premiums in any given year. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan, designed to take effect in 1992, "has companies scurrying to 
revamp their benefits and limit coverage," reports the Wall Street Journal. One 
possible result: less generous health-care coverage for future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Will you settle a family dispute? We'd like to know whether 
Alzheimer's disease is hereditary or if environment is a cause. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: In some cases, Alzheimer's runs in families. But according to Dr. 
Melvin Kanner of Emory University, there is no simple inheritance pattern. This 
may be due to the different ages of onset. When some family members die of 
other causes before they are old enough to develop Alzheimer's, the line of 
descent can be difficult to follow. 
</P>
<P>
If you have one sibling who developed the disorder after age 70, your risk is 
no higher than that of the general population. (Five percent of persons over 
age 65 are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, and 20 percent of those over 80 
experience some type of irreversible dementia, over half of which is caused by 
Alzheimer's.) 
</P>
<P>
If you have a parent and sibling who both get it before age 70, your risk may 
approach 50 percent. A sufferer's identical twin is also at high risk. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the genetic explanation has received support from studies of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the chemical substance of heredity. The pair of 
chromosomes numbered 21 (among the total of 23 pairs in human cells) is 
abnormal in some families with Alzheimer's disease. People with the most common 
form of Down's syndrome, for example, have a triplet chromosome 21 instead of a 
pair, and they typically develop Alzheimer's if they live into their 40s. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there have been many identical twins in which only one had 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
The environment may play a role in Alzheimer's disease, but precisely how 
remains unclear. Infection by slow-acting viruses or an excess of aluminum in 
the diet has been suggested, based on unsubstantiated theories.

PUT ASTROLOGY IN ITS PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations. You have finally found the right place for the astrological 
forecasts -- next to the comics. I admit I occasionally read them, for 
something to laugh at. 
</P>
<P>
Even among the strange people who take them seriously, there are those who find 
grave faults with them. The few that may some day be taken seriously are those 
who base their expectations on the astrological arrangements in the sky at the 
precise moment of birth.

It should come as no surprise, but probably will, to the artsy-smartsy View 
readers who have an abiding disdain for Lt. North, a retired U.S. Marine 
colonel, that such a man would devote "14 hours a day, five or six days a week 
. . . and is doing something for us somewhere, every day" according to John 
Staggers of the Alliance to Save America's Future (SAFE). 
</P>
<P>
This kind of work is tailor-made for North; after all, he has fought his 
country's battles before with dedication and honor. If we are to fight a "war 
on drugs," no one is better qualified to carry out that mission into the 
streets than is North.

In the Sept. 24 View letters, Fred Nathan suggested the possibility of an Ollie 
North presidency. Besides the fact that North is a lying, amoral, 
soldier-of-fortune-mentality wacko, he is also a convicted felon, which means 
that he cannot run for public office. The latter reason you should have 
mentioned.

SAN FRANCISCO DREAMIN' A LONG WAY FROM HOME; 
</P>
<P>
THE FRAGRANCE OF COFFEE AND PATCHOULI HAS WAFTED FAR FROM THE GOLDEN GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GOLD, Novelist Gold's latest book, Travels in San Francisco, will be 
published this winter by Arcade Publishing/Little, Brown. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Milwaukee, a few years ago, if you tired of the beer and sausage, you could 
head down to the Benjamin 2 Cafe and find offbeat, guitar-toting chess players 
and the kind of coffee that made San Francisco's North Beach what we think it 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Or you could head for the Coffee Trader and enter upon a scene of sufficient 
natural wood, health salads, fancy blends, cheese and long-limbed, 
tennis-playing young laid-backs to dry your tears of San Francisco 
homesickness. 
</P>
<P>
In my home town of Cleveland, the Paris of northeastern Ohio, San Francisco has 
firm roots. The little Bohemia around Euclid Heights Boulevard and Coventry is 
North Beach, Haight-Ashbury and 16th &amp; Valencia all rolled into one living 
crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
The art theater sometimes shows X-rated movies and sometimes no movies at all, 
but it's where you can usually count on midnight performances of 
films-to-recite-along-with. Arabica is a coffee house like the Puccini. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopeful Booksellers 
</P>
<P>
Just as in San Francisco, the bookstores tend to fade away; but just as in San 
Francisco, a hopeful bookseller is born every day. At Shaker Square there's 
another bookstore, another Arabica, another movie house, various art galleries, 
and street-strolling under friendly brown skies. 
</P>
<P>
We needn't discuss how the California Dreamin', beat and hip style infected New 
York, Chicago, Los Angeles. But Vence in southern France? The San Francisco 
cafe there is called Feelings and features "American Fish" with cognac sauce, 
"Feelings Tacos" and "Blueberries Lamb." 
</P>
<P>
The dessert special is "un Brownie," which is described as gateau chocolat 
Chantilly, and I urged the proprietor to add "Les Twinkies" to his menu. An 
electric organ plays that old San Francisco jazz. The people there love San 
Francisco, but an electric organ? Sometimes they don't get it exactly right. 
San Francisco is not a roller rink. 
</P>
<P>
In Martinique, too, a few years ago I came upon a California cafe on the shores 
of the Caribbean. My rental car came to a screeching halt on the winding road 
among carnivorous red flowers when I saw swirly Fillmore posters. The 
proprietor said he had spent the best minutes of his life in Sausalito. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Legion 
</P>
<P>
The next year, when I again visited Martinique, the new proprietor was a German 
veteran of the French Foreign Legion, but the Jefferson Airplane and Grateful 
Dead tapes were still in place. "Union Square! Lefty O'Doul's! Levi's 501 
button jeans!" breathed the brave Teutonic former legionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco state-of-mind spread like the smell of patchouli during the 
beatnik and hippie periods, although the image of Westering, the Gold Rush, the 
Sydney ducks, the Barbary Coast and International Settlement, the Black Cat 
saloon gave traditional substance to the aroma. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just the hills around here; it was also the alleys reminiscent of a 
walled medieval town. Lurking and funning were always part of the style. The 
Summer of Love, the Aquarian Age and the youth explosion sewed the label "Made 
in San Francisco" on the world's pants. 
</P>
<P>
Even before glasnost, there were youth cafes in Moscow where wide-rumped folks 
went to do the tveest in their counterfeit Levis. In Toronto, the memory of 
Swingin' London, which is only a memory in London, and Swingin' San Francisco, 
which endures as a transmogrified myth nearly everywhere, has given the former 
Hogtown a blush of pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tie-Dyed Clothes 
</P>
<P>
Among worried upward mobiles at colleges and universities, the San Francisco 
mystique is a frequent elective. Health foods are served as an option in dorm 
meal programs. A person who wears tie-dyed clothes is likely to be a tenured 
professor, but at UC Davis a young man sidled up to me with a precious secret 
to share. In a lowered voice he whispered, "Pssst! I listen to Bob Dylan, too!" 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes even San Francisco seems to be in the business of imitating itself. 
One Saturday afternoon in May I visited the bandstand in Golden Gate Park, 
where Big Brother and the Holding Company was performing a free concert. 
Greenpeace was involved. The new Janis Joplin (Mark II; double mufflers) sang 
out her heart to "save the dolphins," but the unmentioned point was that she 
had a heart to sing out. The voice was strong and passionate, lacking only the 
last desperate, ruined-monument croak of Joplin at the end of her life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal Hippies 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, these seemed to be aboriginal hippies swaying in the sun. Was 
that patchouli in the air? Was that Paul Krassner sniffing it? But many in the 
crowd looked like burnouts and bikers, not the veterans of the old Panhandle 
concerts but their grandchildren. A boy in red, high-topped tennis shoes gave 
me a peace sign. "How are you today?" 
</P>
<P>
"Good," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good day to be good," he said, pronouncing good in the turned-on, 
groovy, three-syllable manner, goo-oo-ood, and his girlfriend in her laces and 
thongs beamed at him, beamed at me, beamed in general. 
</P>
<P>
A huge potbellied man with a bear tattoo on his furry back, a bear and a lady 
chasing each other in the underbrush, glared at me. He was sloped over his 
bike. A Hell's Angel jacket hung from the handlebars. At approximately 300 
pounds, he didn't fear someone would run off with his jacket. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chocolate George 
</P>
<P>
At first I was uncomfortable under his scrutiny, but then someone pointed a 
camera at him and he went into his camera mode, as still as an icon upon his 
saddle, mirrored sunglasses planted amid the grizzle of face, impassive, eager 
to be of use, helping the photographer. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, was enacting an image of San Francisco, this time the San Francisco 
Hell's Angels, even if he was from Oakland. He remembers Chocolate George, the 
Angel who used to drink his chocolate milk on Page until a speeding car at an 
intersection in the Haight ended his chocolate habit and his enriched life. 
</P>
<P>
When we're here, we're just here. The Potrero Hill neighborhood that includes 
the San Francisco Thai Barbecue, the Goat Hill Pizza, that Greek place with the 
good food and the endless name ending in -opolous, the Fifties coffee shop with 
antique Coke signs and jukebox -- it's just another typical outcropping of the 
San Francisco spirit, a mixture of innovation, ethnicity and nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Breatharian 
</P>
<P>
That's where I meet the breatharian, sometimes a writer, who can teach me to 
live without eating. (I doubt I have the intestinal fortitude or chlorophyll 
for it.) 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, we can turn in any direction, take any bus and we're there. 
In Los Angeles, I drive to the Sunset Strip, or to Hugo's in West Hollywood, or 
to Venice in search of area code 415. 
</P>
<P>
At Hugo's they tend to be pouring over scripts instead of manuscripts, but the 
air of expectancy and salads, that dream of salvation through dreamland, puts 
me into the proper procedures of reference. 
</P>
<P>
And in Paris I climb Montparnasse toward the Aubergine, a vegetarian 
restaurant, where I find Alan Ginsberg tinkling his little bells and singing a 
Buddhist country rock song. I'm still home.

GOING WITH THE FLO WHEN THE FLO IS A KNOW-IT-ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Flo Forsythe was a little over four and a half feet tall, with flaming red 
hair. She was also old and had a voice somewhere between that of the late 
Sophie Tucker and a submarine dive alarm. 
</P>
<P>
I'm telling you about Flo three years after the fact, because I think I'm 
almost over being mad at her. She was one of the group when Joyce and I took a 
motor-coach tour on our first visit behind the Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Our fellow passengers looked like a pretty interesting bunch. 
</P>
<P>
John Malesko, a second generation Polish-American, wanted to see "the Old 
Country." He and his wife, Velma, had brought Mrs. Malesko's elderly mother 
along because they had been afraid to leave her at home. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Glickman and his wife, Mary, were from Nashville. There was a red-headed 
doctor from Italy, Bill and Brenda Edmonson from Toronto and a lot more. There 
were about 30 of us. 
</P>
<P>
But Flo stood out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flo the Member 
</P>
<P>
Though she looked like a red-haired Momma by Mel, she dispelled the impression 
that she was from the comics immediately by announcing that she was Flo 
Forsythe, "a member of the Fifth Estate." 
</P>
<P>
"Fifth estate?" Edmonson asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. "I am a senior editor and newspaper columnist." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the fourth estate," said Edmonson. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was "on assignment," that she was first and foremost a reporter 
and that she was going to report on exactly what a tour behind the Iron Curtain 
was like. 
</P>
<P>
She also said she knew no one would mind if she took the front seat for the 
entire tour because she was too short to see well from any of the other seats. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Johnson, a young lady in her early 30s, said a bad word. Someone else said 
"Amen." 
</P>
<P>
Our director, Mr. Verde, advised us that each of the communist countries we 
would pass through would supply a bilingual guide. Hopefully, one of the 
languages would be English. 
</P>
<P>
We were told that we would all have an absolutely wonderful time, and then we 
got a 10-minute run-down on the rotation of seats, the hotels we'd be staying 
in and the currency exchange situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeat the Hood Parts 
</P>
<P>
"Point of order, point of order," said Flo Forsythe. "I'm taking notes, here. 
Could you repeat a little of that?" 
</P>
<P>
"Which part?" 
</P>
<P>
"From the bilingual guides?" 
</P>
<P>
Verde sighed audibly, sat down next to Flo and repeated his explanation. 
</P>
<P>
At the East German border, a few of us stepped off the bus to stretch our legs 
while Verde took our passports into the guard station. 
</P>
<P>
When most of us were back on the bus, Verde explained how they always made 
people wait at Iron Curtain borders so no one would have any doubts about who 
was in charge. "But this time," he said, "maybe just a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes later, Mrs. Forsythe, who had been caught taking pictures of the 
East German guards and the "No Pictures" sign over their shack, was marched 
back to the bus. 
</P>
<P>
As they walked her to her seat,she kept lecturing them about freedom of the 
press until Mrs. Johnson interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Forsythe," she said, "would you kindly put a cork in it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I beg your pardon?" Mrs. Forsythe was indignant. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Malesko's mother sat up straight, smiled brightly and said, "I think the 
young lady said, 'Put a cork in it.' " There was a scattering of applause. Flo 
did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Odor for Another 
</P>
<P>
The Polish border guard station, not having been designed for tourists arriving 
by the bus load, had only two bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The guards, trying to make the best of this bad situation, had been using a lot 
of disinfectant, which simply exchanged one odor for another. Verde explained 
the situation and advised that while we could go into the building to use the 
bathrooms, making remarks about the odor would probably not be a good idea. The 
guard commandant, he said, was already quite embarrassed about it. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of us complained. It got results. Four tour buses that arrived after 
ours left ahead of us, and Flo got a lot of cold, hard-eyed silence. 
</P>
<P>
My wife is very tolerant. "Now, let's be charitable," she said. "Here's an old 
lady who has probably outlived her husband. Her children are probably scattered 
all over the world. They never call. This may be all she's got." 
</P>
<P>
I reminded Joyce about how much money we'd spent for this once-in-a-lifetime 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Being mad at her isn't going to help. A little kindness might, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
We had picked up our official Polish guide, Robert, at the border. He was a 
blond-haired young man with a bright smile and a huge mustache. We all took to 
him from the start; he said he liked Americans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building by Polaroid 
</P>
<P>
On our first night in Warsaw, Joyce and I took a walk with the Maleskos on the 
dark and almost deserted streets of the city. We were approached by men selling 
zlotys and women selling flowers. We bought the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Across the boulevard Verde was walking with Flo Forsythe, while she talked at 
him. She stopped and aimed her Polaroid at the Ministry of Health and 
Education, the largest building in Poland. It was a quarter of a mile away, 
just visible through the darkness. Flo used her flash. 
</P>
<P>
The following morning we had our tour of Warsaw. The city guide, a bright, 
enthusiastic young man, showed us parks and civic buildings and talked about 
Poland's good things. At the presidential palace, home of General Wojciech 
Jaruzelski, we were told not to approach the residence for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
Within five minutes Flo gave her camera to Phil Glickman, told him which button 
to push and walked toward the front door of the general's residence. 
</P>
<P>
"Ma'am," Phil called out, "I don't think you-all better be doing that." 
</P>
<P>
"One picture," Flo said. "Just one for my readers." 
</P>
<P>
She never got it. Instead, she got an armed military escort out of the 
courtyard, and all of us except our city guide were ordered back on the bus. We 
watched while the guide was interrogated by soldiers and then by men in suits. 
When he rejoined us he looked a little gray. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
License in Peril 
</P>
<P>
He spoke to Verde, told us the tour was over and walked off down the street. As 
we watched him go, Verde announced that he would have to attend a special 
hearing the following Saturday and that his license as a city guide was in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Flo said that, in her opinion, it was ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Johnson said that, in her opinion, Flo should shut up. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that Bill Edmonson, who was a retired newspaperman, had a long 
talk with Flo. And that night in the hotel, Robert was given several letters to 
pass on to the hearing board. He promised that they would get to the right 
people. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Flo used the coach's public address system to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"After you reach 39," she said nervously, "you tend to forget other people's 
rights can be more important than the public's right to know." 
</P>
<P>
She said she was sorry and asked everybody to forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
It might have worked except for what happened later. At Auschwitz she took 
pictures of the screen during the film presentation. Just about every important 
moment in the film was greeted by a blast of light as Flo tried, time after 
time, to take flash pictures of the action on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
When she couldn't understand why her Polaroid pictures showed nothing but a 
blank screen, no one offered an explanation. Some of us, including Joyce, were 
so angry that we couldn't talk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Saw the Like 
</P>
<P>
Later, she delayed the coach so she could buy post cards, saying that her 
camera hadn't been working and she had to have pictures to go with her article. 
</P>
<P>
It prompted Mrs. Johnson to observe that she'd never seen a blanking 
4-foot-tall, red-headed, hundred-year-old reporter, nor a blanking post card in 
a blanking newspaper to illustrate a blanking article in her whole blanking 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In Krakow, Flo bought an ice cream just as the bus was about to leave. When Mr. 
Waadt, our driver, honked, she looked around, found a receptacle on the side of 
a building and threw what was left of the ice cream into it. Waadt groaned and 
rose halfway out of the driver's seat as Flo climbed onto the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Drive," said Verde. 
</P>
<P>
"But wasn't that a postbox?" asked Waadt. 
</P>
<P>
"Drive," said Verde. There was desperation in his voice. "Just drive." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even get to finish my ice cream," said Flo. 
</P>
<P>
"Put a cork in it," said Mrs. Malesko's mother brightly. 
</P>
<P>
We left Krakow at the maximum allowable speed. 
</P>
<P>
During the few days we had left in Poland, Robert got very candid in some of 
his answers about the politics of his country. Flo wrote what he said in her 
notebook. 
</P>
<P>
When another city guide, in another communist country, let a remark slip, Flo 
wrote it down. 
</P>
<P>
After the second incident Edmonson talked to her for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to say she changed at that point, and maybe she did a little. 
</P>
<P>
She insisted on trying to interview most of us. But even though she promised to 
put our names in the paper, most of us declined. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Johnson probably said it best. When approached, she told Flo to go suck on 
a frog. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
But No Pictures 
</P>
<P>
Before the tour ended in Frankfurt, Edmonson reported that Flo was, indeed, a 
columnist and a senior editor for a recreation section distributed with some 
weekly newspapers in an Eastern state. A few months after the tour was over, 
another of our fellow tourists wrote that he had just read a story under Flo 
Forsythe's name in his local paper. The article had nothing in it that could 
have hurt anyone. It was not illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
I had been thinking about Flo as if she were what Joyce had said, a lonely old 
widow who'd outlived her husband and whose children never called. 
</P>
<P>
But what, I thought, if that were not the case? What if there had never been 
any husband, nor children, nor grandchildren? What would I be if my life were 
that empty? I don't think badly of Flo anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if Joyce and I spend a few more thousand, hard-earned dollars for 
another life experience, I'll sure hope she doesn't show up on our bus.

CRUISE VIEWS: NOT REALLY SHIPS BUT FANTASY ISLANDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be surprised if tomorrow's cruise ships look more like adult amusement 
parks than ocean liners. 
</P>
<P>
According to Joe Farcus, a Miami-based architect for Carnival Cruise Lines, his 
design for Fantasy -- the first of three mega-ships being built by Wartsila 
Marine shipyards in Finland -- is intended to make it an "entertainment 
facility (with) an environment different from anything they (passengers) 
experience in their normal life." 
</P>
<P>
For example, aboard the Fantasy, Farcus is creating a bar called Cats, inspired 
by the set from the hit theatrical musical. Patrons will enter through a round 
doorway that looks like a gigantic overturned evaporated milk can, then sit on 
banquette seats resembling old rubber tires or soda-pop cans. 
</P>
<P>
Another shipboard bar, Cleopatra's, will give passengers the chance to puzzle 
over hieroglyphics on Egyptian temple columns while surrounded by mummy cases 
and statues of Egyptian gods and Pharaohs. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can check out some reading material by going through a door flanked by 
two granite lions (but made from a granite-resin compound) like those in front 
of the New York Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
The ship will be ready for its first cruise in early January, sailing on three- 
and four-day itineraries to the Bahamas out of Miami. Carrying 2,600 
passengers, the 70,000-ton Fantasy will be second in size to Royal Caribbean 
Cruise Line's Sovereign of the Seas, the largest cruise ship ever built. 
</P>
<P>
While Farcus concentrates on the inside of the ship, Kai Levander and his 
design development team at Wartsila have been devising revolutionary ideas for 
ship shapes for almost a decade. Their Windcruiser concept for a computerized 
sailing ship, for example, was the prototype for the Windstar Sail Cruises 
vessels and the upcoming Club Med I. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more and more interest in providing a ship that sticks out of the 
crowd," Levander said. He visualizes a multiple-appeal ship carrying 3,000 
people that will offer, among other things: sporting events for participants 
and spectators; full-scale stage shows with well-known stars; large marinas for 
water sports; a multitude of restaurants; windows and private balconies for all 
cabins, and a full range of shops comparable to a major shopping mall. The ship 
itself would be the traveler's destination. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Levander's concept sketches show floating 10-story resort hotels, 
self-contained islands in themselves, with huge swimming pools surrounded by 
palm trees and fountains thrust out on all four sides of the ship, or vast 
apartment towers that would look at home in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
On the Fantasy, Farcus is working with colored light in the largest single 
installation of neon in the world -- 12 miles of red, blue and green tubing, 
most of it concealed behind diffuser panels. Computers will control color 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't be able to just sit and watch it happen," he said, "because the 
color changes are subtle. One evening during dinner the dining room may be red, 
another evening, blue." 
</P>
<P>
Lights will also help create a sense of motion along the double-width walkway 
called Century Boulevard, which stretches 450 feet past the casino, cafe, bars 
and shops. 
</P>
<P>
Stationary trams along the roadway are seats that will resemble "futuristic 
cars floating on the road," with floor-mounted strobe lights that make them 
look as if they're moving. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, the disco, called Electricity, will be vivid with dazzling neon 
streaks and strobe lights bouncing off a glass dance floor with copper strips 
and shiny gray tile floors. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers seeking quiet can retreat to the nearby Majestic Bar, a "subdued and 
highly elegant" area, according to Farcus, with its own pianist playing 
before-dinner melodies. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the ship is a six-deck atrium called the Grand Spectrum, a vast 
open space that will twinkle with Tivoli lights, ever-changing colored light 
and two glass elevators. 
</P>
<P>
Also reflecting new trends in ship amenities is the 12,000-square-foot Nautica 
spa, with gymnasium, sauna, steam rooms, beauty salon, aerobics and massage 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Between shows on the quick-change, state-of-the-art stage in the main lounge, 
mirrored walls and ceiling will slide into place to create a romantic dance 
floor sparkling with tiny lights. 
</P>
<P>
Farcus said he has made no special design concessions for the three- and 
four-day Fantasy cruises. Still, the frenetic sense of brightness and motion in 
the public rooms would seem more appropriate to short-term sailings than long 
cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Prices will range from $475 to $1,125 per person, double occupancy, including 
round-trip air fare from most U.S. cities. Ports of call for the four-day 
cruises are Freeport and Nassau; only Nassau will be visited on the three-day 
sailing.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: BANGKOK; 
</P>
<P>
AMONG A MYRIAD ITEMS, THAILAND GEMS GLITTER BRIGHTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BANGKOK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a gem of a city. 
</P>
<P>
Among its glittering facets the most astonishing to first-time visitors are its 
massive, jewel-like gilded temples that sparkle. Thought of as earthly 
representations of heavenly pleasures, the temples are encrusted with mosaics 
of shining mirrors and colored glass. 
</P>
<P>
All the glitter of the temples is reflected, on a smaller but still impressive 
scale, in this city's dozens of lapidary factories and hundreds of jewelers. 
For those who want to take home some of Bangkok's sparkle, these studios and 
shops are terrific sources for finely cut loose gemstones and plain gold and/or 
gem-encrusted jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Because stone cutting and jewelry making are labor intensive and the cost of 
skilled labor is relatively cheap in Thailand, gems, gold and jewelry are among 
Bangkok's best buys. Prices for loose gems ranging in quality from mediocre to 
exceptional, or for magnificent baubles fit for royalty, are usually less than 
half of what they would be in the United States or Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bangkok's jewelry industry has always had appeal, largely because of the unique 
and elaborate designs it has traditionally produced. Yet until recently, local 
gemstone dealers were reputed to take advantage of naive buyers, and 
workmanship was not of high quality. So all but the most informed buyers were 
best off buying attractive but inexpensive costume jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cutting More Organized 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, when mining and the cutting of local rubies, sapphires, garnets 
and zircons became more organized in response to market demand, the industry 
began to change. (Burma, the traditional source for these colored stones, was 
no longer exporting, thanks to political turmoil.) 
</P>
<P>
At first, locally-mined stones were sent to Hong Kong or Singapore for cutting, 
setting and sale. But gradually, local lapidaries and jewelers developed the 
skills required to create their own exquisitely designed and finely worked 
pieces to compete with other, better established Asian jewelry centers. 
</P>
<P>
The industry was given a boost in 1977, when the Thai government discontinued 
import duties on loose gemstones. Skilled Thai jewelers could then enhance 
their pieces with Colombian emeralds, sapphires from Sri Lanka and diamonds 
from Brazil, Siberia and South Africa, as well as locally mined stones. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years the jewelry industry has become Thailand's fifth-ranked 
earner of foreign currency. The export of gemstones and jewelry earned the 
nation in excess of $1 billion last year. It is estimated that more than 
100,000 skilled stone cutters and setters are employed in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doorstep Service 
</P>
<P>
Many of the lapidary factories are large commercial centers and cater to 
tourists. They are located throughout the city (some on the outskirts of town) 
and many will send cars to pick you up if you call for an appointment. Larger 
factories are scheduled stops on city tours that leave regularly from all the 
big hotels. It's taken for granted that guides get kick-backs on sales they 
bring in. 
</P>
<P>
The factories feature tours of their cutting rooms, give cursory presentations 
about the characteristics and quality of various stones, and sell vast 
quantities of prepackaged, pre-matched loose stones in cellophane envelopes 
priced by weight. 
</P>
<P>
Individual stones are stored in glass or plastic bins, and customers may ask to 
be shown any number of them until they find one or several they like. 
Salespeople are patient, polite. They even serve tea. 
</P>
<P>
Although these factories don't handle the finest stones or most exciting 
settings, they are good sources for relatively inexpensive ruby rings, sapphire 
pendants, garnet earrings and other souvenirs, as well as for replacements for 
stones that have been lost from fine jewelry in the vault back home. 
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Authority of Thailand's (TAT) Shopping Guide (free at the airport, 
most hotels and tourist information bureaus) lists more than 100 recommended 
lapidary factories and jewelry shops. 
</P>
<P>
TAT recommended shops are best bets for honesty and fair prices, but buyers 
should always carefully examine stones and settings and ask for receipts and 
certificates that show grade, weight and price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
72 Settings Offered 
</P>
<P>
The N.P. Gems Factory Ltd. (295/2 Rajchaprarob, Phayathai) is one of the 
recommended shops. In a pleasant and calm environment, the shop offers its 72 
standard ring settings ranging from elegant bands of rubies, sapphires, 
diamonds and/or emeralds to elaborate floral or ornate geometric designs. 
</P>
<P>
Set in 18-carat gold, the rings cost about $100 and up. Bracelets cost about 
$140 and up; a pretty 18-carat gold chain with 22 tiny rubies or sapphires 
sells for $200. There are pretty pendants for about $60 and up. Loose stones 
are sold by carat: sapphires are about $28 and up per carat, rubies about $35 
and up, mabe pearls about $20 and up and regular pearls about $30 per carat. 
</P>
<P>
Similar prices are available at TAT recommended Muang Thong Gems (55 Phayathai 
Road), as well as at Pata Gems 33/6-7 Phayathai Road) and Polin Ltd. (860 Rama 
IV Road). 
</P>
<P>
More substantial and expensive pieces are sold in shops in and near exclusive 
hotels and fancier shopping areas. The highly reputed World Jewels Trade Center 
(987 Silom Road), sells magnificently set three-carat richly blue sapphire 
rings for about $5,000 and lovely two-carat pink sapphire rings for $2,000 and 
up. Settings with two-carat Thai rubies are about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
More elaborate items, many individually designed or adaptations of European 
designer styles, have five-figure prices. The World Jewels Trade Center's Asian 
Institute of Gemological Sciences, responsible for training many of the current 
leaders in Bangkok's jewelry industry, will certify stones and rate color and 
quality for about $10 each. On more expensive stones, this quality check is a 
very good idea, unless you have a truly trained eye. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exquisite Top Quality 
</P>
<P>
Cabochon (Oriental Hotel), Yves Joallier (Charn Issara Tower Building, Third 
Floor, 942-83 Rama IV Road) and Bualaad (Peninsula Plaza, 153 Rajadamri Road) 
are known for exquisite settings of top quality diamonds and colored gemstones. 
</P>
<P>
Tok Kwang (244/6 Silom Road) is highly reputed for its terrific treatment of 
fine pearls imported from Japan and Australia, including classy strands of 
fabulous 14 millimeter pearls for about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
These shops also show plain gold jewelry. Although their styles are more 
exclusive, they cannot compete in price with the Chinese- owned jewelry shops 
along Jawaraj Road. There about 25 shops in a row display a remarkable range of 
gorgeous 14-, 18- and 22-carat gold jewelry. Shiny glass showcases glitter with 
exquisitely designed and finely crafted chains, necklaces, bracelets, ornate 
earrings and wedding rings. 
</P>
<P>
Prices, based on the weight and carats of the gold used in the piece along with 
a specified labor charge based upon the complexity of the work, change daily in 
these shops, depending upon the daily price of gold. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the gold dealers in this area have been in business for three or four 
generations and are considered honest. Current gold prices, listed in local 
daily newspapers, should be checked before purchases are made. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest and most popular dealers is Toa Kang Jawaraj Goldsmith &amp; 
Jewelry (with locations at 320, 324-326 and 356-360 Jawaraj Rad), featuring a 
huge selection of chains for neck and wrist, bangles, rings and earrings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Triple the Cost 
</P>
<P>
A 22-carat chain bracelet weighing 16.3 grams costs about $290 and a 22-carat 
ring weighing 3.3 grams is about $70. A 24-carat bangle weighing 15.2 grams is

SOME ISLANDS STILL AFFECTED BY HUGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dramatic headlines might lead you to believe that Hurricane Hugo wiped out the 
entire Caribbean. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
About 16% of the Caribbean resort islands were affected, but Hugo did little or 
no damage to more than 40 other vacation islands when it roared northwest from 
landfall at French Guadeloupe Sept. 18-19. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known Caribbean islands, stretching south and east from Florida to the 
coast of South America, cover a distance comparable to that of the west coast, 
some 1,300 miles. Hugo hit the equivalent of Portland to Seattle, and left an 
area the size of the California coast virtually unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo's detailed itinerary included tiny Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, and St. 
Croix (which lies 40 miles south of its sister U.S. Virgin islands, St. Thomas 
and St. John), plus Vieques and Culebra and the eastern half of Puerto Rico. 
From San Juan, Hugo headed northwest to Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hurricane pruned and toppled trees and raged against buildings, 
splintering those that showed any sign of weakness, Hugo's main effect on 
neighboring islands was downed electrical power lines and trees, high seas and 
torrential rains and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
Sand and sea water gushed through many beachside hotel rooms, but was 
tirelessly swept out again as the first step toward post-hurricane recovery. 
Most hotels have hurricane insurance and will refurbish, repair and rebuild, 
when necessary, for the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
Before Hugo, the region was anticipating an unprecedented boom for the winter 
months, traditionally the peak season. Some places may benefit from 
reservations originally intended for Hugo's islands, but the hard-hit hotels of 
Puerto Rico expect to recover -- to claim the business they had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Guadeloupe's Novotel, in the Bas du Fort area, entertained guests throughout 
the hurricane, and other properties around the towns of Gosier and Bas du Fort 
are already recovering. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors can expect challenges in finding charter yachts. Hundreds were yanked 
from their moorings in the United States and British Virgin Islands, to be 
slammed onshore in a kamikaze action that destroyed both buildings and yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Antigua's English Harbour, on the other hand, coddled its yachts, as the harbor 
did when 18th- and 19th-Century British fleets knew it as a safe haven and home 
port. Most yachts anchored there and in nearby Falmouth Harbour survived. 
</P>
<P>
Yachts in marinas in Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada and other 
islands south of Dominica were well away from Hugo's route. Bookings intended 
for now-ruined yachts will bloat the already plump market in the southern 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
Scuba divers should anticipate cloudy seas surrounding the islands in Hugo's 
path. A roiling ocean changes the sea floor, damaging coral, displacing fish 
and churning once-clear waters for weeks after the event. Check with dive 
masters to be sure that seas surrounding your island are clear enough to offer 
the sights you're hoping to find. 
</P>
<P>
Among the islands affected by Hurricane Hugo (phone numbers listed are for the 
country's tourism office in the United States): 
</P>
<P>
Antigua and Barbuda, West Indies. Hugo's calling card was mostly winds and high 
seas that swept sand into some beach-front places. When the rubble was cleared, 
most places had been spared. For more information, call (212) 541-4117. 
</P>
<P>
British Virgin Islands, West Indies. Many yachts were damaged by Hugo's winds 
and rain, and hotels received a pummeling. However, most hotels on Tortola and 
Virgin Gorda will be in good shape by winter. The Little Dix Bay was accepting 
guests a few days after Hugo went north. Call (212) 696-0400. 
</P>
<P>
Dominica, West Indies. Most of the banana crop of this agricultural island was 
wiped out by Hugo, whose impact was felt in the northern sector. Call (212) 
682-0435. 
</P>
<P>
Guadeloupe, French West Indies. Two islands -- Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre -- 
were battered and bruised by Hugo's visit. Basse-Terre, the western island, 
suffered least; Grand-Terre's southeast coastal town of Saint Francois was 
crushed. Although many seaside shack bistros were destroyed, they will be 
rebuilt as soon as food supplies warrant. 
</P>
<P>
But Hotel Arawak and Hotel Salako, both in Gosier on the southern coast of 
Grande-Terre, are open. 
</P>
<P>
For the upcoming winter, Club Med's enclave at Sainte-Anne, where the south 
coast bends north on Grande-Terre, expects to be in full swing, as do most 
hotels at Gosier and Bas du Fort. Fall will be spent recovering, with help from 
mainland France. Call (212) 757-1125. 
</P>
<P>
Montserrat, British West Indies. Like a farmer shearing his sheep, Hugo denuded 
this once-verdant, mountainous island. Not only were all crops ripped from 
their sockets, but houses were splintered. Immediate British aid was soon 
followed by help from other quarters, but it will be a long time before this 
tiny island will be fully recovered. Montserratians have always been known for 
genuine hospitality; they'll be ready for visitors when life's essentials are 
in place. Call (212) 682-0435. 
</P>
<P>
Nevis, West Indies. Although buzzed by Hugo's winds and rains, most hotels 
escaped serious damage. Places like Montpelier and Golden Rock are 18th-Century 
plantation buildings built for hurricane survival. Hermitage continues to offer 
its family-style hospitality. The island is linked to sister St. Kitts by a 
ferry from Charlestown to Basse-Terre, the capital on St. Kitts. Call (212) 
535-1234. 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico. Hugo turned most buildings on Vieques and Culebra to rubble and 
cut a mean swath from the east end to San Juan, before heading north. Most 
boats in the 600 slips at the recently opened marina at Puerto del Rey were 
smashed. 
</P>
<P>
Although top-floor penthouses felt the brunt of the wind, most San Juan hotels 
fared reasonably well. The Art Deco Normandie was open throughout; the Caribe 
Hilton had some damage that will be repaired for the winter season. The 
Excelsior and other high-rise hotels that are not on the beach had guests 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
The Beach House shoveled the unwanted sand out of its dining room and will soon 
welcome guests to its Ocean Beach locale. The El Canario inns are also back in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Other properties unaffected or affected only minimally include: Condado Beach, 
La Concha, El Convento, Mayaguez Hilton, Ponce Holiday Inn, Days Inn Ponce, ESJ 
Towers, Hyatt Dorado Beach, Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach, Howard Johnson and 
Palmas del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Although more seriously effected, the Empress and Dutch Inn will be open for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
October travelers will not be able to reach El Yunque rainforest, but beaches 
are intact and almost all hotels are expected to be restored to full service by 
then. 
</P>
<P>
It will take a while to rebuild and clean up the islands of Vieques and 
Culebra. Call (212) 599-6262. 
</P>
<P>
Saba, Netherlands Antilles. This tiny island, the tip of a volcano, was blasted 
by Hugo. Many Saban cottages were turned to rubble. Some remain, and can be 
rented this winter. Call toll-free (800) 344-4601 or (516) 261-7474. 
</P>
<P>
St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands. The island was pummeled by Hugo. His 
visit set off a storm of domestic violence, including widespread looting and 
other crimes. It will take a lot of hard work to rebuild what had been a 
thriving tourism economy, but Cruzan residents have done it before (following 
the Fountain Valley killings in 1979) and are doing it now. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneer and Carambola Beach Resort, two of the largest hotels on the 
island, plan to reopen about Nov. 1. The Cormorant Beach Club will be closed 
for repairs until Dec. 15. DIVI St. Crois was seriously damaged and will be 
closed for at least six months. Schooner Bay in Christiansted remains open. The 
Colony Cove will be closed for about two months for repair. Call (212) 
582-4520. 
</P>
<P>
Sint Eustatius (Statia), Netherlands Antilles. Sleeping quietly until Hugo 
roared in its ear, Statia's small beachfront hotels took a beating. Be sure to 
check ahead if you are planning to visit. Call (800) 334-4606 or (516) 
261-7474. 
</P>
<P>
St. John, United States Virgin Islands. On the fringe of the uproar, St. John's 
beachfront properties suffered some damage from high tides, crashing seas and 
wind. Rebuilding and refurbishing should be complete at luxurious Caneel Bay 
and some parts of Virgin Grand. Call (212) 582-4520. 
</P>
<P>
St. Kitts, West Indies. Although seas lurched drunkenly at beachfront 
properties in the area known as Frigate Bay, the small hotels in the mid and 
north sections of the island survived almost untouched. Call (212) 535-1234. 
</P>
<P>
St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. The airport area of Charlotte Amalie 
felt Hugo's full fury. However, the Island Beachcomber hotel, which is in that 
area, expects to be rebuilt for the winter season. Villa Fairview, a guest 
house on the hillside, welcomed visitors throughout. Call (212) 582-4520.

KAPIOLANI IS HONOLULU'S CROWN JEWEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One speaks literally when saying that Honolulu's Kapiolani Park is fit for a 
king. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 years ago, before the islands were annexed by the United States, the 
tree-studded, 300-acre greensward was the private preserve of ruling royalty of 
the Kingdom of Hawaii. The royal family, after seeing public parks in Europe 
and the United States, decided to give the land to the people late in the 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
Today that legacy, named after former Queen Kapiolani, is still a geographic 
crown jewel in this city. At the base of Diamond Head and fronting on the 
golden beaches of Waikiki, Kapiolani Park remains a favorite retreat for the 
urbanized residents of Hawaii's capital city. 
</P>
<P>
But tourists -- often by chance -- also are discovering the great diversity of 
things to do and see in this unexpected green oasis. Most of Waikiki is one 
high-rise hotel after another. But Kapiolani Park at the southern end of hotel 
row is a vast open expanse. 
</P>
<P>
One immediately notices the runners. Kapiolani is where the fleet feet like to 
meet. The options are attractive: running across the lush green -- but firm -- 
turf, or crisscrossing the shaded sidewalks that flank the park. The ocean 
borders one sidewalk at the park, and some runners end their workout by doffing 
their shoes and wading into the clear Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Other physical activities abound. Soccer games are frequent in Kapiolani. It 
also has ample areas for tennis and softball games. 
</P>
<P>
For the couch potato there are acres and acres of trees to snooze under, 
following big island-style picnic lunches. 
</P>
<P>
And for those wanting some interesting sightseeing there are several 
modestly-priced major attractions. One is the Honolulu Zoo near the 
intersection of Kalakaua and Kapahulu avenues at the south end of the park. The 
zoo, open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., has one of the world's best 
collections of tropical birds. Admission is $3. 
</P>
<P>
Across Kalakaua Avenue from the park is the Waikiki Aquarium, which features 
more than 300 species of ocean life. The aquarium is open daily from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., and the suggested donation is $2.50 per person, with no donation asked 
of those under 16. 
</P>
<P>
A free attraction in Kapiolani Park is the popular Kodak Hula Show, Tuesdays 
through Thursdays at 10 a.m. near the Waikiki Shell, an outdoor bandstand. The 
hula show allows visitors to photograph and videotape colorful dancers against 
a backdrop of palm trees and flowers. There are bleachers, but the seats fill 
up quickly. Gates for the hula show open at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
If one wants something more cerebral than hula music, the Waikiki Shell 
frequently offers weekend events of first-rate caliber. The Honolulu Symphony 
Orchestra plays at the bandstand, which is Honolulu's version of the Hollywood 
Bowl. And, like the bowl, concert-goers enjoy picnics in their seats or on the 
ample grassy areas before the opening notes. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Saturday evening the Honolulu Symphony played Tchaikovsky. By the 
concert's conclusion, stars overhead burned brightly as flares and a rousing 
version of the "1812 Overture" echoed off the stately rise of Diamond Head peak 
a few hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
An outdoor concert, Kapiolani-style, is an unforgettable experience. Waikiki 
Shell concert tickets, which vary in price according to seating, are available 
daily at a ticket booth near the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Kapiolani also offers weekly shows by local artists. On Saturdays and Sundays 
the artists display their paintings on the outdoor fences bordering the zoo. 
Most of the display area is tree-shaded. The art ranges from bold seascapes to 
delicate, surrealistic designs. The artists, a friendly bunch, sit by their 
wares, glad to discuss their works . . . and their prices. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about Kapiolani Park and travel to Hawaii, contact the 
Hawaii Visitors Bureau, 3440 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 502, Los Angeles 90010, 
(213) 385-5301.

ASPEN, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Houses may average a million dollars per in Aspen, but budget travelers can 
still make an economical stop in the area. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best deals in town is the Little Red Ski Haus, a 101-year-old, 
red-and-white Victorian home at 118 Cooper St. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the late 1800s, when Aspen was a silver mining town and Cooper Street 
was called Fanny Girl Street, it's believed that this house was a brothel. Now 
it's a cozy B&amp;B with 51 beds, two blocks from the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
You can book into shared men's or women's dormitory rooms (maximum four beds) 
for $20 a night in the summer or $30 to $33 a night in the ski season. There is 
a seven-night minimum stay in winter. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nicest things about the home is that it offers a comfortable 
atmosphere of camaraderie for solo travelers. Guests mingle in the main lounge 
at breakfast and enjoy coffee on the front porch or in front of the fire. 
Breakfasts are free -- continental in the summer and full breakfast in winter. 
</P>
<P>
Guests range in age from teens to octogenarians. In winter, most visitors are 
from Australia. During the summer months you can expect a mix of travelers and 
music students, or guest music festival performers. For reservations, call 
(303) 925-3333. 
</P>
<P>
Although it doesn't have the same interesting atmosphere and history, the St. 
Moritz at 334 W. Hyman St., phone (303) 935-3200, also offers clean, low-cost 
lodgings. Accommodations are in several dormitory rooms (most limited to three 
beds) and cost $19 a night in the summer, $14 in the spring and fall. There is 
a pool and lounge, plus TV, refrigerators and microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
Campers and hikers can get information from the tourist information office in 
the Wheeler Opera House or at the Forest Service Office on the edge of town at 
806 W. Hallam St. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the camping areas require reservations 10 days in advance, but sites 
such as Maroon Lake campground operate on a first-come basis. At the Forest 
Office you can buy the helpful White River National Forest map (it includes 
1,500 miles of hiking trails) for $2 and "Trail Guide For Hikers" for $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
Bikers can get information about special paths in the area from cycle rental 
shops. Both road and mountain bikes are available. Expect to pay $4 to $6 an 
hour, $20 to $25 a day, depending on type and quality. 
</P>
<P>
The view of the mountains from Maroon Lake is one of the most photographic 
sights in Colorado. You can reach the area by taking the free Aspen Highlands 
bus from town, which connects with a special summer tour bus that offers a 
30-minute trip with commentary for $3. You can catch a different tour bus back 
if you want to stay to camp or hike. 
</P>
<P>
The Aspen Highlands bus also takes you past the 500-acre T-Lazy-7 Ranch -- 
phone (303) 925-7040. It's one of the few stables in the nation that allows you 
to ride without a guide. Rates run $16 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.50 Snowmass bus from Aspen will take you to Ranch Arts Center, where, 
for 24 years, leading artists have come to lecture and teach one- to three-week 
courses in photography, ceramics, woodworking, painting and drawing. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesdays at 6 p.m. a community potluck dinner is held at the log cabin 
compound. Everyone is welcome to contribute. At 7 p.m. one of the guest artists 
gives a free lecture.

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Are there special times of the year for touring the White House? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The White House sightseeing tour is conducted year-round. Contact your 
senator or congressman for permission to join special tours that may save you 
from standing in long lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are private golf courses in Ireland open to American visitors? 
</P>
<P>
 A: All of Ireland's courses welcome U.S. golfers; greens and caddy fees range 
up to $15 U.S. each. It is wise, however, to apply in advance because on some 
days there may be tournaments, or all starting times may be filled. 
</P>
<P>
Q: On our European trip we'd like to do some ballooning. Are there tours that 
provide this activity? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Bombard Society packages ballooning tours in France, England, Austria 
and Switzerland, varying in length and itineraries. Contact your agent or call 
the society at (800) 862-8537. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My travel agent is arranging a European tour for my small group and is using 
a foreign tour firm. Isn't that risky? 
</P>
<P>
 A: European tour firms are as competent and financially sound as those in the 
United States. Many are even affiliated with the American Society of Travel 
Agents. Have your agent check the credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I understand it is possible to stay with a Soviet family as a tourist 
visiting the Soviet Union. How is this arranged? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Such stays are being offered by American-Soviet Home Stays, Box 68, Iowa 
City, Iowa 52240, and possibly next year by Intourist, the official Soviet 
travel bureau, at 630 Fifth Ave., New York 10111, (212) 757-3884, which only 
arranges dinner or other brief meetings with a family. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the outlook for resumption of tourist travel to Cuba? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although specialized travel for journalists and others is sanctioned on a 
case-by-case basis, no lifting of general restrictions is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it true that all travel agents sell cruises at discounts. If so, are 
these discounts the same at every agency? 
</P>
<P>
A: While cruise lines allow their agents to sell below the advertised fare, the 
size of the discount can vary from region to region and agent to agent. Be sure 
that you deal with agents accredited by the ship lines. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How much cheaper are the fares advertised by ticket consolidators than those 
available from regular travel agencies or the airlines directly? 
</P>
<P>
A: With many new low fares being marketed, price differences between the 
consolidators and the carriers is narrowing. There are still bargains, however, 
through consolidators, which also are available at travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can I obtain travel advice directly from the State Department? 
</P>
<P>
A: The State Department Citizens Emergency Center provides updated information 
and current advisories on areas around the world. Call (202) 647-5225.

DANA POINT: FISHING VILLAGE TO CITY; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE RAPID GROWTH, SMOG-FREE BEACH CITY RETAINS ITS SMALL-TOWN CHARACTER.

When author Doris Walker moved to Dana Point in 1963, the 6,000 residents 
didn't fully appreciate the sweeping ocean vistas that spread out before them. 
"There was so much open land at the time, nobody really noticed the view 
before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century of development gradually changed that perception. To their 
dismay, residents found their fine natural harbor harder to spot behind a 
growing number of homes, small apartment buildings and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, as developers snatched up more and more prime waterfront parcels -- 
and even diverted Pacific Coast Highway inland at one place -- access to the 
beach became more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Controlling growth became a priority, and it was on the minds of local people 
last year, when they voted to incorporate after a 27-year struggle. The new 
city of Dana Point began operations on Jan. 1, and development issues have 
topped the agenda since then. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council told developers that it wants cautious, quality growth," said 
Tom Brabeck, a Minnesota native who settled in Dana Point in 1969 after a stint 
in the Navy.

Brabeck bought a hillside lot for $15,000 in 1972 and spent $50,000 in 1976 
building a 2,300-square-foot English Tudor-style home. He estimates it is worth 
$450,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the city has stopped the construction of two view-blocking hotels that 
would have overlooked the harbor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the incorporated city numbers 26,000 residents and includes three 
distinct communities -- Dana Point proper, Capistrano Beach to the south and 
Monarch Beach to the north. 
</P>
<P>
The status of Monarch Beach hasn't been resolved, however. Neighboring Laguna 
Niguel, which holds its own incorporation vote Nov. 7, claims the area too, and 
has gone to court over the issue. The contested strip of coastline includes 
some of the most expensive homes in south Orange County, as well as the opulent 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel and its considerable tax base. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brabeck, an associate broker at Roberts Real Estate, the city 
offers housing in a wide price range. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Range in Prices 
</P>
<P>
At the low end of the market, buyers can find single-family homes in the 
Village or Dana Knolls area, near San Juan Capistrano, starting at around 
$250,000. For that money, a purchaser might get a 25-year-old, two-bedroom, 
two-bath house with 1,500 square feet. By contrast, some of the more expensive 
houses in Monarch Beach run into the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Condos range in price up to about $685,000, Brabeck added. That sum would buy a 
2,500-square-foot home on the cliffs above the harbor, with panoramic views of 
the ocean from every room. 
</P>
<P>
As a less-expensive alternative, Brabeck says a 1,200-square-foot Monarch Beach 
condo within 150 yards of the beach recently sold for $230,000. The median 
price for the city, including condos, approximates $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it's ironic that the new city took so long to get established, 
because the area has a long, colorful past. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the 1800s, Russian ships hunted for sea otter in the nearby kelp beds. 
Starting in the 1820s, New England merchant vessels anchored in Dana Cove to 
trade manufactured goods for cattle hides produced at nearby Mission San Juan 
Capistrano and surrounding ranches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yankee Trader History 
</P>
<P>
The area was named after Richard Henry Dana, a Bostonian who visited in 1835 
aboard one of these Yankee traders and described the shoreline with admiration 
in his book "Two Years Before the Mast." 
</P>
<P>
But a permanent settlement was slow in coming to Dana Point. Poor roads and an 
unreliable fresh-water supply discouraged people from moving in, notes Walker 
in "Dana Point Harbor/Capistrano Bay: Home Port for Romance," an illustrated 
history. 
</P>
<P>
According to Walker, the area got a railroad link in 1887, and that spurred 
several attempts over the next half-century to build residential subdivisions. 
In spite of a continuing lack of good roads, periodic economic depressions and 
other problems, a small town started to form on the hills overlooking the cove. 
</P>
<P>
But progress was slow. "During the '30s, hardly anyone was living in Dana Point 
-- just a few scattered fishermen and real estate people," recalled Lorrin 
(Whitey) Harrison, who was born in Garden Grove in 1913 and first moved to Dana 
Point in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the handful of houses that had been built during the '20s were for rent 
during the Depression, Harrison explained, because "nobody could afford to buy 
anything." At the time, he and his family leased a modest house in Dana Point 
for $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abalone Diver 
</P>
<P>
Harrison later moved away from Dana Point for a while, then returned in the 
mid-'40s. He spent much of those early days surfing on 110-pound redwood boards 
in Dana Cove in the years before the harbor was built. He also worked for more 
than three decades as a commercial diver for abalone, selling his catch to 
restaurants up and down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent a lifetime on the water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Development picked up in the postwar years, helped by completion of the San 
Diego Freeway through San Juan Capistrano in 1959. Seven years later, 
construction of the 2,500-boat marina began. "The harbor was definitely a spur 
to growth. It gave the area a personality," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
It also brought boat owners, shops, hotels, tourist dollars, new residents and, 
for the first time, crowding. 
</P>
<P>
Today, on weekends during the summer, traffic backs up on Pacific Coast Highway 
and parking gets tight at the harbor. But the increased congestion isn't 
attributable solely to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Problem 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Todd, who first came to Dana Point in 1983 with her husband, Tim, 
estimates rush-hour traffic on Pacific Coast Highway has increased 30% since 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's growing too fast, but obviously, this isn't a problem unique to 
Dana Point," she said. Even so, Tim Todd suggests, more bike paths and tricycle 
taxicabs could help ease the automobile congestion around the harbor and beach 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Heneghan, a college student and bartender who came to Dana Point in 1967 
with his parents from New York City, worries about the ecological damage to the 
local coastline brought by growth. 
</P>
<P>
Heneghan surfs, swims, canoes and skin dives, and he's concerned about 
occasional raw sewage spills, pollution and soil runoff caused by the new 
housing developments in the hills. "Dana Harbor is still cleaner than Newport 
Bay," he conceded. "But I'd like to see more respect for the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point, along with Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach and other Southland cities, 
also has had some problems with illegal aliens and other day laborers gathering 
on street corners in search of work. The City Council in August banned workers 
from congregating on Dana Point streets but at the same time set up a telephone 
bank to put laborers in contact with employers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smog-Free Summers 
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, residents generally speak favorably of their city. 
The Todds say Dana Point retains a small-town flavor, where people know their 
neighbors. And they rave about the ocean breezes that keep the area cool and 
smog-free throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Todds, originally from the San Gabriel Valley, bought a vacant lot in the 
Village, one of the older neighborhoods of Dana Point, where they built their 
three-bedroom, two-bath house, which they finished in 1988. They never bothered 
to install air conditioning. "You don't need it," said Tim Todd, a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
He estimates that the ocean-view, 2,350-square-foot house is worth $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Lemire believes Dana Point offers some of the best rental values in south 
Orange County. He and his girlfriend pay $900 a month for a two-bedroom 
apartment in the Village area. They have a large outside deck with an ocean 
view, and a two-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
"Rents are a lot less expensive than in Laguna and traffic flows more 
smoothly," said Lemire, a Maine native who installs residential water-treatment 
units. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
East Coast Owner 
</P>
<P>
Some of the older neighborhoods border on the seedy, he said, although he 
hasn't experienced any problems with crime. 
</P>
<P>
Don Kalil regards Dana Point so highly that he talked other members of his 
immediate family into buying a 2,000-square-foot condo near the harbor for use 
as a second home. 
</P>
<P>
That might not seem so special, except that the Kalils live in Wilmington, 
Del., where they run Compu-Val Investments, a money-management firm. 
</P>
<P>
Don Kalil gets out to California frequently on business, and he looks forward 
to these visits. He calls Dana Point a small, friendly town, with plenty to see 
and do within walking distance or a short drive from the condo. The family also 
looked for homes in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach but found Dana Point to be 
less congested and more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
After a heady price spiral last year, the housing market in Dana Point has 
softened this year, with about four times more homes currently offered for 
sale, Brabeck says. He foresees a period of more modest price increases 
following the inflationary burst in '88. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for Control 
</P>
<P>
Most of the new construction is occurring in Monarch Beach and Dana Point, in 
the hills north of Selva Road. Local folks might not like the bulldozers, 
increased traffic and crowded beaches, but the days of the quiet fishing 
village are gone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's foolish to think we'd have the same terrain as in the '60s," said Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she and other residents hope the new city government can keep the 
reins on development. She looks optimistically toward the future, encouraged by 
a master plan for Dana Point and the vigilance of the California Coastal 
Commission, which since the early '70s has cast a wary eye on beachfront 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, originally from Ohio, still lives in the house she moved into 26 years 
ago. She has watched the area around her get built up and the yards grow 
smaller. But through all the construction, Walker has managed to retain a 
partial ocean view, which she calls her private corridor to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"And I treasure it now more than ever," she said.

REAL ESTATE Q AND A: REMODELING OFTEN A BETTER CHOICE FOR HOMEOWNERS THAN 
BUYING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My husband and I are debating whether to add a fourth bedroom and a 
family room to our present home or sell it and buy a larger home. We have 
looked at every brand-new home in our vicinity. While they are very nice and 
are more up-to-date than our current residence, we like our location, the good 
schools and the short commute to our jobs. But some of our good friends 
recently remodeled their home and they almost got divorced. It was a mess. 
Finally, they took a two-week vacation to get away from the construction. 
Because we need more space for our growing family, we must make a decision 
quickly. What do you recommend? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: My home builder friends will crucify me, but because you are happy with 
your neighborhood, I recommend you add on and remodel your home. In most 
situations, this choice is much cheaper than buying an equivalent new home. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you have noticed extensive home remodeling and additions in your 
neighborhood. Homeowners all over the nation are realizing it is usually far 
cheaper to upgrade their current home than it is to sell and buy a larger, more 
expensive home. 
</P>
<P>
Another major advantage is, in most towns, you will keep your old lower 
property tax assessment except for the value of the addition and remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
But before you hire a contractor, please interview at least three. Ask your 
friends for recommendations. Be sure to write down all the work you want 
performed so all contractors will be bidding on the same job. 
</P>
<P>
Before you hire a contractor, check each one out very carefully by inspecting 
at least one of their previous jobs and phoning at least three of their 
previous customers. In most states, you can also check with the state 
contractor's license board and the local Better Business Bureau to learn of any 
complaints filed against each contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, as in many businesses, the home remodeling business has some bad 
apples. But there are also many excellent contractors who work primarily on 
referrals from satisfied customers. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I have had excellent experience with most remodeling contractors, 
but occasionally I have problems with contractors who take on work that is 
beyond their skills. Keep in close touch with your contractor to prevent 
mistakes. Don't become a pest but check the work every few days to be certain 
all is well and the work is being performed according to the written contract. 
It is better to prevent problems than correct them. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended Books for Home Shopper 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a renter who wants to buy a home. But I don't like the idea of being at 
the mercy of real estate agents, mortgage companies, builders and the like. I 
want to learn about the process of buying a house. Do you know of a good book 
about how to purchase a home without getting swindled? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. One excellent new book is "How to Buy a House With No (or Little) Money 
Down" by Martin M. Shenkman from John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, $12.95. 
Another good book is "Before You Buy Your House or Apartment" by William J. 
Klein from Warner Books for $9.95. Both are available in stock or by special 
order at local bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
What to Do If Your Real Estate Loses Value 
</P>
<P>
Q: About three years ago we moved away from Montana. We considered selling our 
home there for about the price we paid, but decided instead to rent it to 
tenants. Since we moved away the home has declined in value. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, it is now worth about $5,000 less than our VA mortgage balance. Our 
tenant recently moved out. We consulted several realtors there and after 
figuring the sales commission, we would be lucky to get rid of the house by 
finding someone to take over our mortgage, but we would have to pay the 
realtor's sales commission. What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is a shame you didn't sell that house when you moved away from Montana. 
Unless you plan to return to your old home, I recommend selling it because 
managing long distance rentals is very difficult. As you discovered, being out 
of touch with local conditions has now cost you dearly. 
</P>
<P>
As you probably know, I recommend listing homes for sale with local realtors. 
However, you may want to try selling your home by running ads such as "nothing 
down, take over mortgage payments." 
</P>
<P>
I presume your older VA mortgage is assumable. If that doesn't work, then 
listing it with a realtor and paying the sales commission out of your pocket is 
the most viable alternative. Incidentally, many mortgage lenders who suffer 
foreclosure losses now go after defaulting borrowers, so don't think you can 
walk away from that VA mortgage without the risk the lender may come after you 
for any loss. Ask your attorney to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
Assessor Erred in Setting Low Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q: We bought a brand-new home about five years ago. The first year our property 
tax was very low because at the time the tax was assessed, the home was only 
partly completed. However, our tax has never been increased since then, except 
for increases in the tax rate. Can the tax collector come after us for the tax 
he forgot to reassess? If we sell the property, can the assessor come after us 
for unpaid taxes? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. In most states the tax assessor can levy a tax on escaped assessments. 
But I am not aware of any state that has a law requiring the property owner to 
notify the assessor of his mistake. If you sell the property, in most states 
the tax assessor cannot go after the former owner for unpaid realty taxes but 
he may be able to assess the property for back taxes. Consult a local real 
estate attorney for further details. 
</P>
<P>
New Books Describe Setting Up Living Trust 
</P>
<P>
Q: Just a quick note to thank you for recommending some time ago that property 
owners avoid probate by putting their assets into a living trust. My husband 
and I followed that valuable advice. It involved some work getting the legal 
descriptions of our properties, having the deeds prepared, and then recording 
them. 
</P>
<P>
A local lawyer charged us $750 but it was well worth the modest cost. Less than 
a month after we completed the living trust my husband died at age 43 of a 
heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Since we owned 11 properties, I was expecting all sorts of delay and 
complications, but his entire estate was subject to only minimal paper work, 
mostly the tax returns, which the lawyer handled for less than $1,000. But I 
haven't read anything in your columns lately about living trusts. Why don't you 
encourage people to use them to avoid the costs of probate? 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss living trusts again. 
Frankly, I don't get many questions about how to avoid unnecessary probate 
costs, so the topic doesn't arise very often. 
</P>
<P>
Since I last wrote about how to save on probate costs, two excellent new books 
have been published. One is "Living Trust" by Henry W. Abts III (published by 
Contemporary Books, Chicago, $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
The other is "Plan Your Estate" by Denis Clifford (published by Nolo Press, 
Berkeley, $17.95). Both are available in stock or by special order at local 
bookstores. I especially like Clifford's book because it contains simple 
tear-out living trust forms. 
</P>
<P>
Can an Agent Sue If Buyer's Terms Refused? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our home is listed for sale with a fine realty agent. Last week another 
agent showed the house to prospective buyers. I was home when they inspected 
the house. They were thoroughly obnoxious people who nit-picked the house. I 
was sure they wouldn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
But the next day they submitted a full price, all-cash offer with only a 
contingency for professional inspection of the house. However, my husband felt 
we should reject the offer because we feel these people will be trouble. We 
rejected the offer because we didn't like the buyers, but we told the agent we 
didn't like the inspection contingency. But now the realty agent is threatening 
to sue us for the sales commission because she brought us a full-price offer. 
Can she win? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. If the listing agent or a cooperating agent brings a home seller a 
full-price, all-cash offer with no contingencies, the seller is not obligated 
to sell to that buyer. But the seller would owe the agent a full sales 
commission since the agent produced a full-price cash offer. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate listing is much like newspaper ads for merchandise, which legally 
are invitations for purchase offers at the advertised price, not promises to 
sell at the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
However, when a realty agent produces a full-price, all-cash offer with 
contingencies, such as your agent produced, if the seller does not accept it, 
the listing agent is not entitled to any sales commission since the agent did 
not produce an offer exactly matching the listing price with no contingencies. 
Please consult a real estate attorney for further details. 
</P>
<P>
Manage Apartments to Save for Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I have been trying to save for a down payment to buy a home. But 
then my wife got pregnant and had twin boys, who are now 4-months-old. We 
decided it would be best for her not to go back to work because after paying 
child-care costs, she wouldn't have much net income. 
</P>
<P>
Our problem is, these developments have devastated our savings program. Before 
the babies, we were saving about $500 per month, but now we can barely make 
ends meet on my salary. Any ideas how we can get a down payment to buy a house? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably the best way to stop the outflow of rent money so you can start 
saving again for a down payment is for you and your wife to become managers of 
an apartment complex. Since she is home all day, she can manage the complex and 
show vacant apartments during the daytime. If you are handy, you can take care 
of minor repairs in the evenings and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Good apartment managers are hard for owners to find. Look through the 
classified want ads in most major newspapers and you will find lots of owners 
looking for apartment managers. If the apartment complex is large enough, you 
can probably get a free two-bedroom manager's apartment plus a little 
compensation. Then you can save all the money you are currently spending on 
rent. In a few years you will have a handsome down payment. 
</P>

CONDO Q&amp;A: 'TYRANNICAL' BOARD CRITICIZED FOR PARKING FINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We have a tyrannical board of directors that levies fines for parking 
violations and other infractions. It's my understanding that only the rulings 
of the U.S. Supreme Court are not subject to judicial review by a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
Yet our board levies unfair fines, giving no consideration to our owners or 
their circumstances. It seems that the board's main goal is to make life 
miserable for the rest of the owners. There are about 1,000 units in our 
complex, and many of the owners are tired of putting up with this board's 
nonsense. How can we appeal their unfair actions? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Some board members feel that once they are elected, they don't have to 
listen to the homeowners who elected them. They lose sight of the democratic 
process. I've heard a board president say to a homeowner, "You elected us to 
run this association, now shut up and let us run it!" At the next annual 
meeting, this man was not reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Boards have a responsibility to govern the association. Most boards try to do 
so in the best interests of the association as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners have a responsibility to obey the governing documents and rules and 
regulations. However, all homeowners have rights! 
</P>
<P>
You have a right to a hearing before the board to explain your feelings and ask 
for their consideration if there are reasons for your infractions. The board 
should not levy a fine until after it has given you the opportunity to appear 
at a hearing (due process). 
</P>
<P>
If you wish to appeal the board's action, consult your association's governing 
documents to see what procedure to follow. Try to work this out amicably with 
your board. In too many situations like this, resentments lead to litigation, 
which should always be the last resort. 
</P>
<P>
If a majority of owners are dissatisfied with the board, you should have no 
difficulty getting a petition signed by other homeowners requesting a change in 
enforcement procedures. If the board does not respond to your petition, your 
easiest recourse is to vote them out at the next election. 
</P>
<P>
Association Can't Get Meeting Quorum 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a large number of units in our homeowners association that the 
owners have rented to tenants. What happens when the percentage of non-resident 
owners is so high that it is impossible to get a quorum at our annual meetings? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your association's governing documents should stipulate the percentage 
required for a quorum. You cannot legally conduct a meeting if you don't have a 
quorum. The meeting would have to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
Many associations have conducted "get-out-and-vote" campaigns by knocking on 
doors and reminding resident owners to attend or send a proxy. Non-resident 
owners often want to participate in the voting process and must be given the 
opportunity to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Most association documents allow proxies to be used for quorum and voting 
purposes. The official notice of the annual meeting should include a proxy form 
that can be returned to the board if the owner is unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Limited Partnership Has Board Control 
</P>
<P>
Q: After eight years, the developer of our complex still owns 51 of the 65 
units. Three board members are from the developer's limited partnership, so 
that he controls all board action. How can the other 14 owners amend the 
CC&amp;Rs to provide for one vote per member rather than one vote per unit? 
</P>
<P>
A: The 14 individual owners make up only 22% of the total membership. Under the 
circumstances you will be unable to amend the CC&amp;Rs. It would probably not 
be legal to restrict the owner of 78% of the units to only one vote. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like you are stuck in an association that will continue to be 
controlled by the limited partnership that owns the majority of the units. If 
the board is not acting in the best interest of the entire association, then 
you may have to initiate legal action to make your voice heard. Again, legal 
action should be a last resort. You may decide that selling your unit is the 
preferable solution.

REALTY FIRMS FIND CLIMATE TOUGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new Laventhol &amp; Horwath survey of the U.S. real estate industry reveals 
that 85.8% of U.S. real estate firms believe it is more difficult to do 
business today than it was two years ago, and 53.1% think the situation will 
get even worse. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate firms were asked to identify factors that represent limitations or 
constraints on their future growth and profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Heading the list of concerns were overbuilt markets (75.6%), state and 
government regulations (63.8%), environmental controls (60.1%), community 
opposition to construction development (53.4%) and impact fees (45.1%). Federal 
government regulations, including tax reform, were judged to be a relatively 
minor issue.

PRIME TIME FOR PLANTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, Times Garden Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month is the best possible time to plant just about anything in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, nurseries like to think that everyday is a great time to plant, if 
you just water enough," said Frank Burkard Jr. of Burkard Nurseries in 
Pasadena, "but October is a special month. No doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
It's also the nurseries' biggest month, a testament to the fact that 
Californians are catching on and that the advantages of fall planting are not a 
secret anymore. Fall is no longer the undiscovered Cinderella of seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Watering is one big reason the timing is right. 
</P>
<P>
With any luck at all, fall and winter's rains will help with that tedious 
chore, and even if they don't come as hoped, it is a lot easier to keep young 
plants -- whether they be ground covers or trees -- watered now than in the 
summer, the season that follows spring, the traditional time to plant and the 
time to plant if you live elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more. 
</P>
<P>
"The soil is still warm from summer and things like Iceland poppies and pansies 
really take off," Burkard added. "If you wait to plant spring color in late 
November or December, it just sits there for three months." 
</P>
<P>
He's talking about one kind of fall planting -- the planting of small bedding 
plants such as calendulas, pansies and primroses (see the complete list in the 
chart on Page 13). 
</P>
<P>
These bedding plants are best started from small packs or flats at this time of 
the year, or even seed if you feel adventuresome. Although you will find plants 
already in flower, younger plants that will have the time to develop good root 
systems before flowering will make bigger and better flowers and flowering will 
last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to keep plants watered almost daily the first week until they send 
roots out into the surrounding soil, and if a Santa Ana begins to blow don't be 
afraid to water every morning and sprinkle them lightly mid-afternoon to help 
them through. 
</P>
<P>
Dry Santa Ana winds are not as hard on plants as most people think, unless they 
are exposed to the full brunt of the wind. Even then, they may wilt but will 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be some exciting new strains of spring flowers this fall. 
We'll have black pansies, and pink ones, separate colors of Iceland poppies 
instead of just a mix, and the best primroses you've ever seen. And lots of 
bulbs, probably 35 to 40 varieties of freesias alone," Burkard said. 
</P>
<P>
Bulbs are another staple of fall planting, though not all should be planted 
right away. Two -- tulips and hyacinths -- should not be planted until December 
(they need to be chilled in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator for 
at least six weeks). But, now is the time to buy them, and others. 
</P>
<P>
"The first week of October is the best time to shop for bulbs, when we have the 
freshest stock and the most to choose from," Burkard said. 
</P>
<P>
There's been a change in what bulbs people plant in California. 
</P>
<P>
John Bauman at the Palos Verdes Begonia Farm, a general nursery despite the 
name, said that freesias, sparaxis and daffodils are now the most popular 
"because people know that these will return year after year and they don't have 
to keep replanting them. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own garden, a few bulbs of daffodils have spread to cover a 3-by-3-foot 
area, and the sparaxis have made a meadow. Of course, they are in a 
well-drained soil and I don't water too much in summer when they're dormant." 
</P>
<P>
Daffodils are one bulb to plant right away because they need time to develop a 
good root system before blooming. Sparaxis and freesias will also grow and 
multiply easily, and you don't need to dig a big hole since they are only 
planted with about an inch of soil covering their tops. 
</P>
<P>
These bulbs, plus those shown in our fall planting chart, are available at most 
nurseries. At Burkard Nurseries, known for their choice selection of bulbs, you 
even find some real rarities, which command fancy prices, such as the African 
Urginea, with bulbs that can weigh as much as 20 pounds, and flowers that grow 
to 4 or even 6 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
The bulbs, incidentally, are extremely poisonous -- a common name for this 
plant is "rat poison squill" and are reputed to be a great gopher repellent. 
Like many bulbs from Africa, this one naturalizes here in California so you 
don't need to start fresh every year. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure you know how deep and how far apart to plant each kind of bulb. The 
nurserymen can help, but it's handy to have a good guide and the best is the 
widely available HP Books' "Bulbs, How to Select, Grow and Enjoy," by George 
Harmon Scott, a Southern Californian with years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
Perennials, most of which flower in spring or early summer, can also be planted 
now, though many gardeners wait until March. The reason is that it's hard to 
tell what you're buying at this time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the better time to plant because they will be thoroughly established 
and strong by spring," Bauman said, "but the plants are going dormant now and 
look pathetic. We'll still have lots available for those who know their plants 
and have a little imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Burkard agrees: "They won't look like much but this is when we plant our 
perennials and we'll have some 250 different kinds to choose from." 
</P>
<P>
Other nurseries may have less stock, but they will be carrying perennials for 
fall planting. 
</P>
<P>
"When customers ask me 'When is the best time to plant?' I usually say spring 
or fall and if they pin me down, I'll say 'fall' for sure," Bauman said. And 
he's not just talking about flowers, but trees and shrubs and ground covers. 
"It's the best time to start or redo a whole garden, even the lawn." 
</P>
<P>
Sod is the best way to start a warm-season lawn (Bermuda, zoysia, St. 
Augustine) at this time of the year, but it is very easy to sow a lawn of the 
new tall, turf-type fescues that are becoming the most popular grass in this 
half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Trees and shrubs and ground covers will not show immediate signs of growth, but 
rest assured (research has proved it) that they are making strong root growth 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to stake trees properly to protect them from Santa Ana winds -- two 
sturdy stakes, a foot on either side of the trunk, with the tree tied between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Fall planting works for these permanent parts of the landscape too. The soil 
is still warm so roots of trees and shrubs and ground covers make immediate 
growth and with some help from the rain, everything is thoroughly established 
in time for the big burst of growth that comes in spring," Bauman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEKEND YOU CAN PLANT 
</P>
<P>
Almost all perennial flowers. Bulbs of all kinds but tulips and hyacinths must 
be refrigerated for six weeks before being planted. Among flowers you can plant 
now are:

<TEXT>
<P>
Methods of projecting vacancy factors and the rehabilitation of existing 
property will be on the agenda at the third annual Apartment House Investment 
Conference on Oct. 31 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar will also include reports on recent rulings and court trends, 
valuations and expected rates of return, approaches to tax deferred exchanges, 
and discussion of the economy and its expected impact on apartment house 
investment.

<P>
The seminar will be presented by Alan A. (Scotty) Herd, a Beverly Hills 
realtor, and a panel of real estate, legal and financial experts. The 8 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m. forum is sponsored by UCLA Extension and the Apartment House Assn. of 
Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The futurist has become more important than the analyst," in the business of 
apartment investment, Herd said. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar will focus on the continuing effects of tax reform, rent control, 
changing investment requirements, no and slow-growth initiatives, changing 
consumer habits and attitudes and environmental concerns. The speakers are:

KIN OF BLACK ARCHITECT GETS MORE DATA FOR BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karen Hudson, granddaughter of the late architect Paul Williams, has been busy 
in recent weeks, sifting through the stack of mail she received in answer to 
her plea for information on Williams-designed houses. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson was the subject of a Times story July 23, detailing her efforts to write 
a book on her grandfather, the first black member of the American Institute of 
Architects, who designed dozens of movie-star mansions and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Hudson has had 370 letters and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Many wrote that they knew my grandfather's work but had no idea he was black," 
Hudson said, "and others wrote that they were annoyed to learn that many people 
had never heard of him." 
</P>
<P>
From the readers, Hudson learned that her grandfather designed 40 instead of 20 
homes in Hancock Park, 35 instead of 10 to 15 homes in La Canada Flintridge. 
"And I had to make 40 additions to my Beverly Hills list," she said. She had 
thought he designed about 1,000 mansions, including 400 on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Some readers offered personal accounts of living in Williams-designed homes 40 
to 50 years ago, and one couple wrote that they have been restoring a La Canada 
Flintridge home he designed that they are hoping to occupy by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Some architects phoned that they were going to tear down some houses he 
designed until they read the article," Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
Actress June Lockhart phoned to say that she was married years ago to an 
architect who took Hudson's grandfather for lunch to a popular Sunset Strip 
restaurant, where they were told to leave because Williams was black, Hudson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another reader told Hudson that he and her grandfather bought a Beverly Hills 
office building with plans to move their offices there. The reader, who was 
white, said he moved in, but Williams couldn't, because the deed was written so 
a black could not occupy the building. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a rude awakening to me," Hudson said, "because my grandfather never 
talked about racism. . . . For all his grace and charm, my grandfather 
suffered, as did all black men of his time. As I begin to visit some of the 
homes he created and think of all he had to endure on a daily basis, his feat 
becomes even more of an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Among those already inspired is a black girl in the 10th grade who volunteered, 
after reading the article, to help Hudson sort through Williams' plans. The 
youngster commutes Saturdays from Long Beach to Hudson's office at 4501 S. 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"She looks at my grandfather as a role model," Hudson said, "because she wants 
to be an architect."

LANCASTER RETAIL CENTER IS LAUNCHED BY SELLECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Tom Selleck put on his other hat, as chairman of Selleck Properties, at a 
ground breaking for a $9-million retail complex in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Somerset Village, the 75,279-square-foot project is being developed on 
the northeast corner of L Avenue and 20th Street by the 7-year-old Woodland 
Hills-based firm, headed by Selleck's brother, Robert D. Selleck II, as 
president and owned by Selleck's father, Robert D., who is a principal. 
</P>
<P>
The ground breaking also drew Lancaster business and civic leaders, led by 
Mayor Lynn Harrison, who hailed the project's promise of offering a "wide 
assortment of goods and services." 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Selleck II noted that he had assembled some of the same development 
team members who contributed to the firm's Gateway Center in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Olshan, project architect with LeRoy Miller &amp; Associates of Santa 
Monica, said that the Lancaster development will consist of six buildings 
ranging in size from 3,000 square feet to a 36,300-square-foot Hughes Market, 
the second Hughes Market in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate a series of articulated storefronts and numerous corner 
opportunities," he added. A 9,100-square-foot pad, directly on the corner, will 
complete the new center. 
</P>
<P>
D&amp;D Commercial Construction of Claremont is project general contractor; 
Union Bank is providing construction financing, and InCal Leasing of Pasadena 
is handling leasing.

CONDO ADVANTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Eberts' Speaking Out on the benefits of living in a condo (Sept. 17) made 
sense to me. 
</P>
<P>
I particularly agree with the statement that condo owners can, unlike most 
middle-income homeowners, virtually pick and choose what neighborhood they wish 
to live in. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us, I think, have a somewhat fallacious notion that the kind of house 
you live in is more important than the type of neighborhood or, to extend the 
analogy further, kind of community you live in. 
</P>
<P>
Within the urban area, whose neighborhoods and communities differ so greatly in 
such quality of life factors as crime, insurance rates, pollution, traffic 
congestion, etc., I believe one should pick environment first and structure 
second. That is, unless your goal is primarily to pursue real estate 
speculation, which, obviously, many L.A. area homeowners do as "second 
careers." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, good neighborhoods are often where the highest values are, too! 
</P>
<P>
I don't think living in L.A. has much of a future for many people. But condo 
owners -- and renters -- at least have some consolation in that they can afford 
to live in the few pockets of desirability.

DESIGNING A SAFE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the two balcony guardrails pictured in the Sept. 17 Real Estate Section, the 
one Teo Van Runkle is posing on appears more penetrable and less safe. 
</P>
<P>
If his mother is a licensed architect, she knows that the Uniform Building 
Code, the code adopted by most communities in this area, has a "6-inch sphere 
test" for guardrails. 
</P>
<P>
According to this code, all guardrails are to be designed so that a 6-inch 
diameter sphere cannot pass through them. The rationale behind this test is 
that a guardrail (which, incidentally, must be 42 inches high), which precludes 
a 6-inch sphere, will also preclude the head, shoulders and body of a toddler 
such as Teo. 
</P>
<P>
I can't put a tape measure to Teo's mom's guardrail, but by comparing it to 
Charlotte and Chester Owens' on the same page, I surmise that the Matthews-Van 
Runkle railing does not meet code, even with the extra horizontal rail. 
</P>
<P>
It would be interesting to put the pictured railing to the test. Contrary to 
being portrayed as a new design feature sensitive to the needs of young 
building users, upon verification, I would notify the building department of a 
code violation. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt that the pictured guardrail was built for one of the model homes for 
California Showcase '89 at Calabasas Park Estates. Wherever it was built, did 
Matthews submit her construction drawings to the local building department for 
review? Were they approved by the plan checker? Is the railing 42 inches high? 
Was it, in turn, signed off by the building and safety field inspector? Let's 
see a copy of the building permit! 
</P>
<P>
Bahram Nashat's statement that, "most features in the child-safety model homes 
are mandatory under current building codes" is precisely my point. It is the 
individual who thinks he or she is above the codes -- and builds non-complying 
structures -- that makes building officials tough on the rest of us who work 
hard to insure our designs meet or exceed the minimum public safety standards 
established by the codes. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Editor's note: Architect Lise Matthews replies that the guardrails in her 
residence were built to code and meet the 6-inch sphere test mentioned in Tom 
Brakefield's letter. However, in her own experience, this did not prove 
restrictive enough for her child and other children. The horizontal bar was 
added as a deterrent. She added that the National Institute of Children's 
Environments has recommended a maximum 4-inch sphere test and that has been 
implemented in the California Showcase homes mentioned in Evelyn De Wolfe's 
article.

HAMMER HINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in reference to the article, "Tooling Up: A Rookie's Guide on What to 
Buy" (Sept. 3). 
</P>
<P>
The author, Charlyne Varkonyi of the Baltimore Sun, put forward some misleading 
and potentially dangerous recommendations concerning the purchase of a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Varkonyi states, "Look for a cast rather than forged-steel claw hammer of 
smoothly polished steel. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, I doubt that any consumer would be able to find a hammer with a 
cast head. Any good hammer is always drop-forged steel. Cast metal breaks 
easily and can send chips flying. Forging is a process that strengthens steel 
and is necessary for any tool subject to stress and pounding, such as a claw 
hammer. 
</P>
<P>
I find it hard to believe that Michael DiMenna, owner of Schumann Hardware in 
Baltimore, who is quoted by Varkonyi, would tell her to select a cast rather 
than a forged hammer. She must have lost something in the translation. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Alhambra 
</P>
<P>
Editor's note: The letter writers are correct: Forged-steel claw hammers are 
safer than cast types. Varkonyi reports that the information on hammers was 
transposed in the article.

SAVING OLD PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was moved by Morris Newman's article, "Old Pasadena Project Is Dogged by 
Profits Vs. Preservation" (Aug. 13), on the efforts of Claire Bogaard of 
Pasadena Heritage to save historic buildings at Colorado Boulevard and Fair 
Oaks Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in Altadena and I love the region. That part of Pasadena was part of 
my territory. I rode the bus and spent hours delving into Army surplus stores 
on Colorado Boulevard and looking at stamps and coins at the Royal Stamp Co. 
Years later, I worked in the Pasadena Art Museum (now the Norton Simon). 
</P>
<P>
The approach to development as conveyed in this article is that compromise is 
all right as long as it is convenient, but the overriding value is profit. This 
attitude (which we are all responsible for) reveals much that is wrong with our 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Common sense tells us how shortsighted such a view can be. Southern California 
has long witnessed the obliteration of unique character and continuity provided 
by specific places. Perhaps one day we will see the tide turn. 
</P>
<P>
Changes and evolving use are inevitable, but economic development and 
preserving of legacies should go hand in hand.

WITH A TRAIL OF MEMORIES AND BUMPY WEATHER AHEAD, EL MONTE AIRPORT STEERS 
TRICKY COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dean Cayot remembers when El Monte Airport was little more than a landing strip 
on a stretch of sandy riverbed, surrounded by dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a dairy right there where the tower is," said the flight instructor, 
pointing at the airport's squat tower, topped by the usual glassed-in air 
traffic control center. "The farmer didn't like the airport, so he used to pile 
bales of hay down at the end of the runway. Every once in a while, his cows 
would break out, so you'd come in to find a runway full of cows." 
</P>
<P>
The scene at El Monte Airport, a 103-acre stretch of open ground wedged between 
Santa Anita Avenue and the Rio Hondo Flood Control Wash, often still has a 
sleepy, rural quality. With a single 4,000-foot north-south runway, the field 
sees little of the hectic, split-second airborne choreography of an urban 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
But the county-owned general aviation facility, catering mostly to private 
fliers, has progressed far beyond the pasture days. 
</P>
<P>
"This little field really pops sometimes," said air traffic controller Ira 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Anita Park is open, with the high-rollers winging into the area from 
across the state, and when law enforcement officers are on the prowl in the San 
Gabriel Valley in their helicopters, the El Monte runway has been known to 
handle as many as 125 takeoffs and landings in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been called one of the busiest airports per square foot," said Fred 
Berry, supervisor of the control tower. 
</P>
<P>
Cayot, 64, a short, tightly packed man with an iron-gray crew cut, leans 
against a car at the opening of a big hangar belonging to Alpine Aviation, one 
of three flight instruction and airplane maintenance firms on the field, and 
considers how El Monte Airport has changed since he first started flying there 
25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A forest of little private planes, an assortment of high-winged Cessnas and 
low-winged Pipers, spreads across the Tarmac next to the taxiway. Long, low 
hangars, laid out in a row like Army barracks, parade toward the far end of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came here, there wasn't a building that's here now," Cayot said. 
</P>
<P>
A Cessna Citation jet, a small corporate airplane that California Edison uses 
to transport its executives around the state, suddenly swoops down the runway 
and, with a high-pitched whistle, roars off to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Private jets, and the noise they make, are another recent development, said 
Cayot. "Like all the rest of the world," he said, "things get more complex as 
it goes around." 
</P>
<P>
Complex and nettlesome. As with small fields everywhere, the turning world has 
brought troubles to freedom-loving private pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the recent economic picture for the general aviation industry 
depressed -- as are, consequently, prospects for expanded business at the 
airport -- but private pilots in El Monte must contend with adversaries 
including edgy federal regulators, soaring fuel prices, smog and neighbors 
complaining about noise. 
</P>
<P>
You get used to the grinding motors of the little single-engine planes, grouses 
William Dohman, president of the tenants association at Daleview Mobile 
Estates, a development for senior citizens north of the airport. "It's the big 
planes," he said. "They're very noisy. They have to get down so low to have 
enough space to stop. It drowns everything out." And the helicopters -- they 
really churn things up, he added. "Some people complain that, as the 
helicopters go over, the chimes in their clocks go off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The airport management and pilots who use the airport have devised a noise 
abatement procedure that directs planes away from residential areas, advising 
pilots to follow the flood control channel that skirts the western edge of the 
runway. And circling planes are directed by air traffic controllers into a 
pattern 1,000 feet above the airport, instead of the customary 800. 
</P>
<P>
Big signs near both ends of the runway, where airplanes rev up their motors 
before taking off, spell out the departure procedure, complete with diagrams 
and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Manager Gary Harshman goes to the south end to show how it works. He 
points at a Cessna 150 churning down the runway and lofting toward Orange 
County. "See, he's making a slight right turn," he said, as the airplane 
follows the westward meander of the flood control channel, veering away from a 
residential neighborhood south of Valley Boulevard. "That's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
But some complain that the procedures are regularly violated. "They don't live 
up to it at all," said Cloyd Brackney, another Daleview resident. 
</P>
<P>
Others said it's not the noise that bothers them but the danger. "It never 
bothered me until a couple of years ago, when all the airplanes started falling 
out of the sky," said Lee Mendoza, who has lived on Bessie Avenue, west of the 
airport, for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
Harshman insists that there is better than 90% compliance with the noise 
abatement procedure. "If you have a brand new student, it might be difficult 
for him," he said. "Or maybe somebody from out of town. But most comply." 
</P>
<P>
Nagging disputes between airport and neighbors, whose homes crowd the field on 
all sides, have been going on for so long that there's a ritual quality to it. 
"They call up and say, 'The planes are knocking the pictures off my wall,' " 
said one battle-hardened air traffic controller. "You want to say, 'Get bigger 
nails.' But you have to be polite." 
</P>
<P>
But the city, and its leaders, appear to have accepted the continued existence 
of the airport (although one city official says privately, "If the airport 
wasn't there, that would be a heck of a piece of property to develop."). 
</P>
<P>
More worrisome to airport administrators and private pilots is the sputtering 
state of the general-aviation industry. The airport's business has eroded in 
recent years, and the county is considering leasing it to a private firm. A 
combination of high fuel costs (about $1.75 a gallon for "100 low lead" at the 
airport fuel station), rising insurance premiums, sticker shock for airplane 
buyers and high rental costs have cut down on airport operations, county 
administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1970, you could rent a plane for $13 an hour," said Cayot, who ran the 
field's Piper dealership for 13 years before high costs forced him out of 
business. "Now, the same plane will cost you $45 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Although El Monte has always been a profitable airport, with income last year 
of more than $500,000, business in the county is stagnant, county officials 
say. Ten years ago, during the heyday of general aviation in Southern 
California, El Monte registered 235,000 takeoffs and landings a year. This 
year, Harshman said, the airport may not crack 190,000. 
</P>
<P>
What this means for private pilots is the likelihood of dealing with a private 
contractor on the field, and paying higher fees for hangar space and tie-down 
rights. "From conversations we've had (with county officials), we figure it's 
probably 50-50" that the airport will go private, said Dennis Robinson, 
president of the 100-member San Gabriel Valley Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
More troublesome still for many pilots are increasing restrictions on where 
they can fly and what kind of equipment they'll be required to have. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old airport, one of two in the San Gabriel Valley (the other is 
Brackett Field in La Verne), is wedged between the San Gabriel Mountains and 
the terminal control area, the broad chute of airspace through which the big 
westbound jet airliners travel to Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
That makes the Federal Aviation Administration nervous. Wright, during a slow 
period in the control tower, points out the big picture on a map. Three miles 
off the southern end of the El Monte runway, over Legg Lake, is the edge of the 
terminal control area, whose lower extremity at that point is at 2,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that big a factor, unless someone's doing something they're not 
supposed to be doing," said Wright. 
</P>
<P>
But federal bureaucrats, with the nightmare of a 1986 collision between an 
Aeromexico DC-9 and a private plane over Cerritos still vivid, are doing 
everything they can to make sure those kinds of accidents don't happen again. 
For example, the FAA may soon require all airplanes flying out of El Monte to 
be equipped with a special altimeter that can be read via a radar signal by air 
traffic controllers. The minimum cost, said Robinson, will be about $700. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem fair," said one pilot, "if your normal pattern doesn't take 
you anywhere near LAX." 
</P>
<P>
Problems such as these have taken away some of the romance of flying, pilots 
complain. "Maybe there was more camaraderie in the past," said Cayot. "There 
were more people standing around, kicking dirt and doing hangar flying. More 
people sat around on the weekends and talked about flying than actually flew." 
</P>
<P>
Many complain that the airport lacks a terminal and restaurant to serve as a 
focus for airport life. "Pilots will fly in and ask you, 'Now, where's the 
restaurant?' " said air traffic controller Cherie Conners. "When you tell them 
there is none, they turn around and fly right back out." 
</P>
<P>
Cayot, for one, isn't sure that the airport's lack of "hangar fliers" is such a 
bad thing. "Sure, I miss (the old days), though you get so you know all the 
stories backwards," he said. "But there are two sides to it. It's nice to have 
camaraderie and friends, but it wastes a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dentice, a bustling man who works as mechanic and pilot, has been a 
fixture at the airport since the early 1970s. The FAA, with all of its new 
restrictions on private planes, is going into overkill, said Dentice 
vehemently, as he pokes with a wrench at the motor of a small single-engine 
airplane in his small hangar. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't want risk, stay in your bedroom and hope there's no fire or 
earthquake," he said. Dentice, 58, is one of three master mechanics at the 
airport who work as FAA inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
But Dentice doesn't buy the death-of-romance arguments. "When you break out on 
top of the clouds and -- how does the poem go? -- 'slip the surly bonds of 
earth,' it never fails to promote an emotion," he said. "The romance and awe 
are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Then Dentice, who flies to El Monte daily from his home in Crestline, in the 
San Bernardino Mountains, thinks about commuting. "When you're following the 
210 Freeway at 120 miles per hour, looking down at all the red (brake) lights 
down there," he said, "that's another kind of emotion."

A MUSICAL DREAM COME TRUE; 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA CITY COLLEGE GIVES THEATER ORGAN A NEW HOME 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of a dream arrived last week at Pasadena City College on the back of a 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pretty hefty dream, requiring a mechanical hoist and the labor of five 
men to jigger it through a back entrance at Sexson Auditorium and onto a place 
of honor under the stage spotlights. 
</P>
<P>
When they finished, the men stood back and admired it: a three-tiered, 
black-and-gold console belonging to a $750,000 Wurlitzer Theater Organ. 
</P>
<P>
The organ is a dream come true for the college, the Los Angeles Theatre Organ 
Society and the family of J. Ross Reed, all of whom have worked for the last 
three years to install the instrument at PCC. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the culmination of a lot of people's dreams," said Sexson Auditorium 
stage manager Frank Way. "That's why (the dedication concert) is called 'A 
Dream Come True.' It was just about everybody's dream." 
</P>
<P>
The dreams included those of Ken Crome, an organ society member who pieced 
together cast-off Wurlitzer parts during the 1970s to create his dream of a 
perfect organ. 
</P>
<P>
A Michigan pizza parlor bought the instrument in 1979 and used it for a time. 
But a few years later, it was auctioned off to the society, which hoped to 
place it in a public hall as part of its concert and fund-raising program. 
</P>
<P>
Enter J. Ross Reed, a Pasadena electrical engineer, who next acquired the organ 
from the society in 1985 and installed it in a La Mirada warehouse. But two 
weeks after the first public concert in the warehouse, Reed died, leaving his 
seven children to fulfill his dream of a public home for the instrument where 
schoolchildren could play it. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena City College became a logical choice. Reed and all of his children had 
attended the institution. In addition, the school's auditorium was originally 
designed for a theater organ but one had never been installed for lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Now, $100,000 worth of repairs have been completed on the organ by the society, 
which will maintain it and use it for concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Another $100,000 worth of renovations in the auditorium have been made by the 
college, which will use the instrument as part of its music course offerings. 
Already, 18 students are enrolled in the college's first theater organ class. 
</P>
<P>
But much work remains before the Oct. 14 debut concert. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, organ pipes littered the auditorium stage. Some lay in wooden crates 
and others stood in rows backstage. They must be carried up ladders and into 
two high-ceilinged rooms on both sides of the stage, where they will sit in 
orderly ranks -- 1,667 pipes ranging in size from wooden growlers as wide as an 
air-conditioning chute to tiny pipers as thin as a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
"This organ, although it's old, it's new," said Donn Linton, president of the 
Los Angeles organ society. "It's state of the art." 
</P>
<P>
For theater organs, that means using a computer to relay signals to the pipes 
instead of old-fashioned electric wires. Before computers, an entire room 
filled with electrical wires was needed. Now, a computer beneath the stage will 
perform the same function. 
</P>
<P>
Linton, as are many organ enthusiasts, seemed equally engrossed by the 
mechanics of the instrument as by its aesthetics. Theater organs, he explained, 
unlike their church cousins, are generally smaller and have less force. They 
were designed during the era of silent films to simulate an entire orchestra, 
with sound effects such as train whistles, fire engines and even the human 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
"A church organ may have four times the size of a theater organ," Linton said, 
"but it can't do justice to a Sousa march." 
</P>
<P>
Organ aficionados also know that no two theater organs are alike. Each varies 
depending on its works and the building that houses it. Thus, PCC's organ will 
have a new sound in its new environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, this will be a magnificent thing," Linton said. 
</P>

'UC DIAMOND BAR': BOTH CITY, COUNTY LIKE THE SOUND OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's just one among 50 cities in the state that have flooded the University of 
California with letters and phone calls, each wanting to host one of the three 
new UC campuses to be built by the beginning of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
But with the recent endorsement of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, 
Diamond Bar officials are optimistic that their city of 46,700 people will 
catch the attention of university officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We meet all the qualifications," Diamond Bar Councilman John Forbing said. "We 
have low-cost housing in the area, transportation, open land, freeway access, 
and there are jobs available." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the supervisors voted 3 to 0, with Deane Dana and Kenneth Hahn 
absent, to support the concept of UC Diamond Bar. The motion, proposed by 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, was amended to also suggest building a campus in the 
Antelope Valley. Among the several other Los Angeles County cities that have 
asked for a campus are Lancaster, Palmdale and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Logical Area' 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Wednesday a member of the legislative analyst's staff testified 
before the Senate Education Committee that the three new campuses are 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The county resolution says Diamond Bar is a "logical area for this new Southern 
California campus. . . . The surrounding San Gabriel Valley, Pomona and Walnut 
Valley areas are mature communities with diverse population as characterized by 
ethnic, economic and age demographics. There is strong community support and 
facilities, including medical, educational, environmental, transportation, 
communication and housing." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the UC Board of Regents determined that three new campuses are 
needed to absorb the impact of burgeoning enrollment at the nine existing 
campuses. Officials indicated that one will probably be built in Northern 
California, one in Southern California and one in the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By Oct. 19, a group of consultants will have narrowed the list to 50 to 60 
possible sites. That list will be shortened to 15 by February, 1990, and to 
eight by next July. In October, 1990, the final three will be selected. 
Construction of the campuses, each estimated to cost $300 million, will start 
by the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
As the deadline approaches, UC headquarters in Oakland has been flooded with 
expressions of interest from chambers of commerce, city and county officials, 
and residents all over the state, university spokesman Rick Malaspina said. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar sent UC the council's resolution shortly after it passed. Other 
cities are taking more elaborate measures. In Redding in Northern California, 
Malaspina said, T-shirts are for sale sporting UC's blue and gold emblem along 
with the hopeful message "I support UC Redding." Officials there have also sent 
the university a videotape of the area. And in Mariposa, seventh-graders at a 
local school have started a letter-writing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Palm Springs, Mayor Sonny Bono has written a letter to the 
university boasting about his area's many amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Said Forbing of Diamond Bar's decidedly low-key approach: "I would imagine 
printing up T-shirts isn't going to have a whole lot of do with the regents' 
decision."

W. HOLLYWOOD CONDO OWNERS LEFT IN LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Shatsky knew that he was in trouble last month, when, after several 
attempts, he couldn't enlist a real estate broker to help him sell his West 
Hollywood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to touch it," said Shatsky, who with his wife, Michelle, bought 
their modest, one-bedroom condo a year ago after scraping together the $9,500 
down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they want to sell it, but as the result of a state Court of Appeal ruling 
that upheld a West Hollywood law prohibiting the conversion of apartment 
buildings to condominiums without the city's approval, they and scores of other 
condo owners are left in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
And, convinced that they've become pawns in a legal tug of war between the city 
and the developers who sold the units, some condo owners have accused city 
officials of dragging their feet in finding a solution to help them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Talk' 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard a lot of talk, but that's all it is, talk," said condo owner 
Landon Baretto, who angrily got up and walked out recently while two members of 
the City Council met with his condominium association. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, issued in July by the Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, directed a 
lower court to issue a restraining order barring future condominium conversions 
that violate a ban imposed by West Hollywood officials in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But the three-judge panel left unresolved the outcome of conversions that 
occurred in violation of the ban, saying West Hollywood officials are best 
equipped to deal with the "variety of problems" the conversions pose. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have interpreted the ruling as giving them control over what 
happens to 26 buildings with about 600 units, at least 300 of which have been 
sold to individuals whose property rights now appear to be under a cloud. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood officials insist that they are not interested in penalizing 
individual condo owners, saying that they want to bring to account the 
developers who sold the units in violation of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Settlements Close 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Abbe Land said last week that the city is near to settling with three of 
the estimated 20 developers, which may soon clear up problems with three of the 
buildings. She declined to identify the buildings or say how many units are 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get these (three) negotiations finalized, we hope that it will serve 
as an incentive for a lot of the other developers to sit down and talk with 
us," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on conversions began as a moratorium imposed by the City Council the 
day West Hollywood became a city in 1984. The council followed that up with an 
ordinance in 1986 that prohibited the owners of apartment buildings from 
converting rental units without first obtaining conditional-use permits from 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
After the developers who owned the buildings went ahead with the conversions, 
citing permission from the county before cityhood, the city went to court to 
halt the sales. But on three occasions, Los Angeles Superior Court judges ruled 
in favor of the building owners. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Michael Jenkins said West Hollywood is "bending over backward" in 
its talks with the developers and is not seeking to levy fines against them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contribute Money 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, they are being asked to contribute money to provide 
affordable housing in West Hollywood that is roughly equivalent to the 
so-called "in-lieu" fees charged developers as part of any new project. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for various owners of the buildings who sold units as condos have 
appealed the court decision to the state Supreme Court, which is expected to 
decide by November whether to hear the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Some condo owners, after having met with city officials, are upset that the 
city has not simply exempted them from the condo conversion law and thus 
dispelled the uncertainty surrounding their property titles. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials and several lawyers familiar with the dispute say that to do 
so would cause the city to lose any legal leverage it has in encouraging the 
developers to come to terms. 
</P>
<P>
"If (city officials) say, 'OK, we recognize that these are condominiums and not 
apartments,' then what basis does the city have to go after the developers in 
court, if need be?" real estate lawyer Phillip Chronis said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, if they let the little guys off the hook, then the big guys get 
off the hook with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grown Impatient 
</P>
<P>
That is no consolation to Shatsky and other condo owners who have grown 
impatient in the two months since the appellate court decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's going to buy a condo when you've got a city claiming, in effect, that 
if you do, you won't really own it, because it was illegally converted," 
Shatsky said. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife were counting on being able to sell the condo to repay an 
individual loan they obtained recently to help them buy a house in Los Angeles, 
Shatsky said. 
</P>
<P>
And, to add insult to injury, as far as they are concerned, under West 
Hollywood's tough rent control law, the couple cannot charge enough rent for 
their condo to cover the mortgage payment, real estate taxes and condo 
association fees. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be as bad if there was a sense that the city was concerned about 
us," he said. "But here we are, trying to be patient, and who's doing anything 
for us?" 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone has been willing to wait. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filed Suit Against City 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Stephen and Allison Sapunor, who bought one of the affected condos 
less than a week after the court ruling, filed suit against the city and the 
seller, as well as the title company, escrow company and real estate broker 
involved in the sale, claiming that they should have been warned about any 
problems that might affect the title. 
</P>
<P>
"To say that my clients, and, I'm sure, others as well, are innocent victims is 
an understatement," said Ronald M. Greenberg, the couple's lawyer. The suit 
seeks to have the couple's condo excluded from the list of properties the city 
says were illegally converted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a renters' rights activist has criticized city officials for 
ignoring the plight of tenants in the former apartment buildings who were 
evicted when the apartments were converted to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"We sympathize with condo buyers and don't wish them any more trauma, but the 
ones who got the short end of the stick were those tenants who got evicted 
needlessly," said Larry Gross, executive director of the Coalition for Economic 
Survival. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city's negotiations with developers should "include some kind of 
remedy for (the tenants), whether it is in the form of a financial settlement 
or assisting them to obtain affordable housing."

There is a wound that won't heal along Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
It has been nearly 18 months since the wrecking ball took the Pacific Coast 
Club, one of this city's most elegant landmarks, to make way for a $40-million 
condominium tower. But not a stone has been laid in the foundation of the 
trendy high-rise that was supposed to ease the loss of the 62-year-old castle 
by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the nonprofit Minnesota-based corporation that had posted the money for 
the project pulled out months ago and the real estate is about to be sold to a 
group of Japanese investors, developer Rob Bellevue said. 
</P>
<P>
And the vacant land that has sat idle for so many months is less a testament to 
sensible modernization than a reminder of the "cruel lesson" preservationists 
and city officials say they learned when the city lost a piece of its stately 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a disgrace," preservationist Renee Simon fumed. 
</P>
<P>
"It just makes me want to weep," Planning Commissioner Nancy Latimer said. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least a dozen accounts of what went wrong in the long fight to 
save a club that virtually no one wanted destroyed, the once-private enclave 
featuring oak beams and chandeliers where the city's elite gathered to swim and 
dine. 
</P>
<P>
Some blame the preservationists who bickered over pulling down part of the 
building to save the rest. Some blame the developer who secured the demolition 
permit when the city denied his plans to turn part of the club into a seaside 
hotel. Some blame the nearby Villa Riviera residents who groused that the hotel 
would have ruined their view. And some blame city officials who quibbled over 
legalities when time was running out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Slap in the Face for City 
</P>
<P>
All sides agree, however, that the loss of the Pacific Coast Club and the 
similar demise of the historic Jergin's Trust Building was a slap in the face 
for the city of Long Beach and may have changed its redevelopment priorities 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
"It took the demolition of those two buildings to wake the citizens of Long 
Beach up," said Douglas W. Otto, chairman of the Coalition to Preserve Historic 
Long Beach. "We learned through the Pacific Coast Club that the community cares 
about its past and is willing to go to some lengths to preserve it." 
</P>
<P>
The old club's future looked grim almost from the day it was abandoned in 1970. 
A teen-aged boy plunged to his death exploring its decaying insides and its 
owner went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Then John Chenoweth took his first look at the towering old building and "fell 
in love." Chenoweth, the executive director of the Minneapolis Employees 
Retirement Fund, said the nonprofit corporation had a social conscience, a 
billion dollars to invest and an urge to restore a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
When it became economically impossible to save the entire club, developers 
created plans for a bluff-side hotel and condominium complex that would have 
saved some of the most elegant rooms from the bulldozer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chenoweth flew to Long Beach in the spring of 1987 to present to the city his 
group's plan to salvage a once-stunning piece of architecture. What he said he 
found, however, was a frenzy of politicking over the building's fate, a City 
Council meeting that ran "like a kangaroo court" and city officials who behaved 
"like a bunch of Neanderthals." 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't just some out-of-towners out to make some fast money and move on. 
We were out to make a commitment to that community," Chenoweth, still miffed, 
said. "But the city of Long Beach did nothing to preserve and protect the 
historic old building it had there. Not only did they do nothing, they made 
life very difficult for those of us trying to do something. We were between a 
rock and a hard place." 
</P>
<P>
At an all-night meeting in May, 1987, city officials rejected the plan to build 
a 200-suite hotel, 100 condominiums and several restaurants around the the 
low-rise portion of the Pacific Coast Club. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone should be hung on the tree for a lack of regard for historic 
preservation, it's Mayor Ernie (Kell)," said Chenoweth, a former state senator 
from Minnesota. "He was biased, he lacked basic courtesies and quite frankly, 
he exhibited the lowest standards of democratic procedures." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Claim No Choice 
</P>
<P>
Kell could not be reached for his response. But other city officials say there 
was no choice but to reject the hotel proposal that would have spilled onto 
coastal land controlled by the state, obstructed views and set a bad precedent 
for beach development. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put a private hotel on the beach. You just can't do that," said 
Robert Paternoster, director of planning and building. "We told them all along 
that even if the City Council approved it, it would get turned down by the 
(state) Coastal Commission." 
</P>
<P>
When the hotel plan died at the council meeting that night, the Minneapolis 
Employees Retirement Fund's enthusiasm died with it. "We just want to close the 
book on Long Beach and on that mayor," Chenoweth said bitterly in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Rob Bellevue said he worked for nearly another year with the city and 
local preservationists to find a way to save the club. Every month it cost 
$130,000 to maintain and guard the abandoned building around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"You're forcing me to be the executioner of the Pacific Coast Club, and it is 
something I do not want to be," Bellevue then warned the city. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed everyone wanted to save the building, but no one could agree on the 
way to do it. On April 26, 1988, the wrecking ball swung. It took a full month 
to bring the building down. A few chandeliers and column heads in the city's 
storage yard are all that remain today. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until several months after the club was gone that Bellevue discovered 
the Minnesota investors had no interest in funding a modern high-rise built at 
the expense of history, the developer said. 
</P>
<P>
All plans stood still while Bellevue searched for new backers. He said he has 
been negotiating for several months with a Japanese corporation he will not 
identify 
</P>
<P>
and a sale is about 60 days from closing. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Bellevue said, construction is set to begin within six months 
on a 16-story, Spanish-style condominium with a tile roof. The new investors 
are talking about marketing the units in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tougher Law Discussed 
</P>
<P>
In the days since the club was razed, the city has taken up the cause of 
historic preservation. Ruthann Lehrer was named Neighborhood and Historic 
Preservation Officer. City officials and preservationists are discussing a 
tougher law requiring developers to demonstrate that they have the financing 
and permits before a historic building can be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
"We've learned to preserve a landmark while it's hot, to work together or lose 
it. We must be careful never to let this happen again," Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the scarred land glares from Ocean Boulevard, a grim reminder of 
what might have been avoided. City leaders can only wonder whether a solution 
would have presented itself had the club been left standing these past 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"Any development project exists in a moment in time. Markets change, public 
perceptions change," preservationist Otto said. "Who is to say if the Pacific 
Coast Club were still there in a more mature market that someone couldn't find 
a way to save it? But it's not there anymore. In the moment in time that 
existed, we did the best we could."

SEEKING PREVENTION OF ALCOHOL ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the Commission of Alcoholism, I want to commend you and John 
Mitchell for the excellent article on Sept. 3, 1989, "All-Out Against Alcohol." 
The article was a meaningful one. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Trisha Roth is a courageous citizen who has been willing to take on an 
unpopular position. We need more people like her in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is to be congratulated for allowing its readers to know what some 
citizens are doing in the prevention of alcohol use by minors, drinking-driver 
accidents and the misuse of alcoholic beverages by adults. 
</P>
<P>
Keep up the good work, L.A. Times.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
AIR TRAVEL SECURITY BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 392 to 31, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 1659) requiring 
U. S. airlines and high-risk domestic and international airports to upgrade 
their defenses against terrorism. In a policy shift, the U. S. Treasury rather 
than the private sector would pay for stiffer airport and flight security. 
</P>
<P>
The bill requires airlines to install state-of-the-art explosives detectors at 
airports rated as likely terrorist targets. Commuter flights feeding major 
airlines would have to greatly tighten security, and airports would be required 
to begin computerized personnel screening to keep saboteurs out of sensitive 
areas such as baggage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's cost of nearly $240 million over the next two years would come 
mostly from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund rather than new appropriations. 
Built by ticket taxes, the fund has a surplus of $5.8 billion that serves 
mainly to reduce the deficit. President Bush opposed the bill on grounds that 
the cost should be met by airlines and airports and, where federal funds are 
necessary, through the discipline of the appropriations process. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Glenn M. Anderson (D-Harbor City) said the government should pay the 
cost because "the barbarous activities of terrorists are directed at . . . the 
U. S. government, not at the commercial carriers." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) said: "Those who fly on international flights 
should pay for their own security through a surcharge of just $2 a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Arms Control Dispute 
</P>
<P>
The House rejected a bill (HR 1495) to reauthorize the Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency through fiscal 1991 at a cost of about $73 million. The vote 
of 247 to 140 fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill 
under a shortcut parliamentary procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The agency puts into effect arms control policies set by the President and top 
Administration officials. Congress also has influence over it. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly at issue on this vote was House committee control of the agency's 
On-Site Inspection Agency, which monitors Soviet compliance with the 
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty's requirement that the superpowers 
destroy their intermediate-range missiles. The bill gave the Foreign Affairs 
Committee more jurisdiction over the agency than the Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said the bill will promote "greater 
reassurance that (INF) compliance is, in fact, occurring." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) said the bill undermines "our ability to ensure that 
the INF treaty is implemented." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

AN URBAN SHOE TREE; 
</P>
<P>
'GAME' OF THROWING SNEAKERS ONTO WIRES FRUSTRATES RESIDENTS OF 'SHOE VILLAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strange sight has remained unaltered for more than four months on a short 
Highland Park street that residents sarcastically call Shoe Village. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of tennis shoes -- old and new, expensive and cheap -- hang by their 
laces from utility wires crisscrossing Sycamore Park Drive, a modest, 
ethnically mixed one-block, dead-end street just east of the Pasadena Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say they throw old shoes up there because they get a kick out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my friends," said Sean Bumcrot, 17, "whenever their shoes get old, they 
hang 'em up there instead of throwing them in the trash." Bumcrot said he has 
hung two of his own pairs on the wires, the blue-and-yellow Nikes and the old 
white ones with the tongues hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
But there is an ugly side to it. Some shoes have been stolen from the front of 
houses of Asian immigrants who removed them before going inside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Victimized 
</P>
<P>
Ranee Jitdanai, a Thai immigrant and Buddhist who lives on Sycamore Park Drive, 
is one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Jitdanai said her family's shoes have been stolen three times this year, 24 
pairs in all. "And my children buy Reebok, expensive shoes. Why can't they buy 
K mart shoes?" she asked, smiling sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 years, since arriving in the United States, Jitdanai, her husband and 
their two sons had left their shoes on a shelf on the porch before entering 
their house, immaculately decorated with Thai dolls and sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Now they put them in a cardboard box in a corner of the living room, leaving 
only a few old pairs worn for gardening on the porch. 
</P>
<P>
Bumcrot knows all about the thefts. His friends do it, although not him, he 
said. "That's why they stopped leaving their shoes outside," he said 
matter-of-factly, referring to the Jitdanais. The thieves keep good shoes and 
heave worn-out ones onto the wires, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His friends, Bumcrot said, also stole shoes from two other families that live 
in the block, immigrants from Korea and China. Both families refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
Jitdanai, a nurse at Sycamore Hospital who declined to be photographed, said: 
"I don't want any enemies. I have two children in high school." 
</P>
<P>
That same fear has kept the friendly, soft-spoken woman from filing complaints 
with police even though, in addition to the shoe thefts, someone recently 
smashed her car windshield, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors are baffled at the apparent lack of interest from public 
officials. They complain that the shoes are unsightly, create a hazard by 
overloading the cable and signal the urban decay that attracts undesirables. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they do it," Maria Cervantes, one of the neighbors, said of 
the shoe-throwers. "It looks ugly. I tell the boys not to do it again, but what 
else can I do? The policeman walks by and doesn't care." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, who requested anonymity, said he contacted the Department of 
Water and Power, Pacific Bell and field representatives of Los Angeles City 
Councilman Richard Alatorre four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
A utility crew promptly removed about 30 pairs of shoes from a power line, 
neighbors said. But Pacific Bell never responded, the man said, and neither did 
the councilman's office. 
</P>
<P>
The man said he first contacted Alatorre's field representative, Shirley 
Minser, four months ago and made a follow-up call to Alatorre Deputy Rosa 
Morales a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Minser said she did not recall receiving a complaint. "I'm sorry I didn't act 
on it, but I don't even remember it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, though, acknowledged receiving the call. "I'm trying to find out what 
phone company to contact," she said. "Is it Southwest or Pacific Bell?"

SURPLUS SCHOOL SITE SOLD TO BUILDER FOR $9 MILLION

<P>
The Board of Education of the Downey Unified School District has given its 
final approval for the sale of a surplus elementary school site to a Los 
Angeles-based home builder for $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The district will receive $6.75 million from M.J. Brock &amp; Sons Inc. once 
the sale clears escrow, which could take as long as two years, said Gary 
Orsinger, assistant superintendent of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $2.25 million will be paid as M.J. Brock sells the homes proposed 
for the 10.5-acre Edith Unsworth School site, which is in a residential area at 
9001 Lindsey Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement approved by the Board of Education also enters the district into 
a limited partnership with M.J. Brock. In addition to the money from the land 
sale, the district will receive 35% of any profits generated by the proposed 
housing project, Orsinger said. Orsinger did not have a projection of those 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
M.J. Brock must still secure necessary permits from the city to build the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
District officials plan to use about $4 million of the money to renovate 
several buildings at Downey High School. The rest will pay for other building 
improvements throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
The district stopped using Unsworth as an elementary school in June, 1972, 
after a decline in enrollment. It then was used to house special education 
offices, which have been relocated to the district's newly expanded 
administration center.

When Daphne Niall came up with the idea for her fourth-grade students to 
illustrate a social studies lesson on black American inventors with a mural, 
she had no idea the project would become the handiwork of champions. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, everyone involved considered it a routine social studies project. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted (the class) to be aware of some concrete things that have been 
contributed," said Niall, adding that she always tries to work in "something 
ethnic" during the year. 
</P>
<P>
The expectations proved overly modest when the work won recognition at the Los 
Angeles County Fair recently as the best class project in the show, netting the 
school its first gold award at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
The project, consisting of individual drawings strung together to form a 
10-foot-long mural, illustrates about 40 inventions, among them the fire escape 
and the baby carriage. The inventors' lack of recognition was apparent in the 
fact that Niall was unable to find many of their first names. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students said they had no idea so many things, from the ironing 
board to the letter-box, had been invented by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar of the Lakers) invented the (sky) hook," said 
Charles Brown, 11. But he knew nothing about the inventors eventually included 
in the mural. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't recognized because white people thought they were superior and 
thought they were the only ones who could do anything," said 10-year-old Drew 
Pierce, now a fifth-grader. "I thought that was mean." 
</P>
<P>
Vice Principal Laural Erpenbeck was proud of the students and the school. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a big thing to have (won) out of all those hundreds of entries, 
including Beverly Hills, and they have their own art teachers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Mayflower winner was a diorama by fifth- and sixth-graders to 
illustrate the book "The Secret Garden," she said. That project came in second 
in the sculpture and three-dimensional category.

Thousands of feet under the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, scientists salvaging 
$450 million in gold from a 19th-Century shipwreck also found some 
not-so-precious metals: old beer and soft drink cans. The chief scientist, 
Charles Herdendorf, said the discovery was disgusting. "We're working a mile 
and a half deep, 200 miles at sea," he told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "That 
shows the extent of ocean pollution." Although the "Central American Project," 
based in Columbus, Ohio, is recovering gold from the Central American, a 
steamship, the project's main mission is science, Herdendorf said, and he is 
curious about what the discarded cans may reveal about ocean currents and 
marine biology, besides pollution. "I'm anxious to recover some of the cans to 
see if any creatures use them for habitat," he said.

 -- New York's Metropolitan Opera announced that Luciano Pavarotti has 
withdrawn from six performances in Amilcare Ponchielli's "La Gioconda" 
scheduled for January. Pavarotti's manager, Herbert Breslin, said the singer 
had to cancel the performances so he could undergo scheduled treatments for 
sciatica, a painful condition in the hips and thighs. A Met spokesman said 
there are no plans to ban Pavarotti, as Chicago's Lyric Opera did recently 
because of a series of cancellations there. Pavarotti will sing at the Met in 
"Rigoletto" in November and February. Nicola Martinucci will replace Pavarotti 
for the first two performances of "La Gioconda," with casting for the other 
shows to be announced.

 -- Walter H. Annenberg, a former publisher and ambassador to Britain, has 
given $5 million to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the museum said. Annenberg, 
a friend of former President Ronald Reagan, also gave $15 million to New York's 
Metropolitan Museum of Art and $5 million to the National Gallery of Art, with 
all three gifts to be used to expand the museums' collections, the Philadelphia 
Inquirer reported. "This is something we not only weren't expecting, we weren't 
even asking for," Philadelphia Museum of Art President Robert Montgomery Scott 
said. Annenberg had just given the Philadelphia museum $5 million in June.

 -- A Dallas third-grader landed a Cessna 210 at New York's La Guardia Airport, 
taking the record as the youngest pilot to fly across the country. Matthew 
McLendon, 8, had left Los Angeles on Monday and traveled 2,700 miles, stopping 
in 13 cities. Rick Barber, Matt's flight instructor, sat as co-pilot but Matt 
insisted that he not touch any controls. DAVE JOHNSON

LITTLE COAL-COUNTRY TOWN RUNNING OUT OF YOUTH, TAXES, TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
Tired old Jacksonville is running out of coal, youth, taxes and time. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging on with only about 60 residents, caught between decreasing tax revenues 
and increasing state pressure to install sewers, the Borough Council has begun 
to talk about disbanding and casting Jacksonville's nearly square-mile of 
territory to the mercy of neighboring townships. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go another five or 10 years, no one is going to be here anymore," said 
Councilman Stanley Gryczuk, 77, a retired miner and butcher. 
</P>
<P>
"The old ones are dying off and the young ones leave us," said Councilwoman 
Mary Grimm, 81, a retired cook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not as Big as Saltsburg 
</P>
<P>
Jacksonville, about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, was never as big as nearby 
Saltsburg. But plentiful coal and hard work kept it on the map, its young folks 
close and its future hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
With neat frame houses scattered along a hillside, it boasted as many as 150 
residents in the 1930s, mostly coal miners and their families, and even a bank, 
barber, butcher, blacksmith and railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the quietest, nicest town you'd ever want to see," said Jacob Grimm, 
84, Mary Grimm's husband, a retired miner and himself a councilman "for, oh, 
about 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Council members say there are fewer people willing, or able, to govern. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Salva, in his 60s, has been too ill to attend a council meeting in 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect him to come to the meetings. We bring things to him," Mary 
Grimm said. "In the last election, we were trying to get someone new to be the 
mayor, but no one would run, so we just wrote Tom in." 
</P>
<P>
The average age of the council members, including the Grimms and Gryczuk, is 71 
1/2 years, without counting young Frank Stango. 
</P>
<P>
Stango, 21, a business major at nearby Indiana University of Pennsylvania, was 
recruited for the council several years ago by his mother, Councilwoman 
Josephine Stango, 56, a part-time postal worker. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Adam Gordish, a retired coal miner, is 75 years old. His son-in-law, 
Robert Yatzkanic, 56, is also a councilman. Delores Yatzkanic, Gordish's 
daughter and Yatzkanic's wife, is borough secretary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GOP Landmarks 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone is a Democrat. Mary Grimm said there are six Republicans and 
she can give directions to each of their houses. 
</P>
<P>
Townsfolk say Yatzkanic, an X-ray technician at a nearby Westinghouse Electric 
Corp. plant, is one of the half-dozen or so people in Jacksonville still 
working. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's retired," Mary Grimm said. "We have more widows in town than 
anyone else. The young people grow up, go to school and then they leave." 
</P>
<P>
The council also expects young Stango to leave town one of these days. It 
recently won permission from a Common Pleas Court judge to allow it to 
eventually reduce its numbers from seven to five members. 
</P>
<P>
"Jacksonville's as big as it's going to get," Stango said with a shrug. "Unless 
something comes this way, I don't see any reason for anyone to move in." 
</P>
<P>
The borough has no property, no municipal building and no equipment of its own. 
The council pays $10 to meet once a month in a classroom at the United 
Presbyterian Church about halfway up Mill Street. 
</P>
<P>
Delores Yatzkanic estimated the borough's annual budget at about $19,000, 
mostly to keep water in a few fire hydrants, street lights illuminated and Mill 
Street and a few side roads repaired and plowed. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have to name our side streets until we got ambulance service," Mary 
Grimm said. 
</P>
<P>
The borough pays a man with a pickup truck $45 to plow and sand the streets 
whenever it snows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Demanded $700 a Year 
</P>
<P>
Council members were shocked when a state agency said Jacksonville must 
contribute $700 a year for unemployment insurance for the trucker and the 
borough's part-time attorney. 
</P>
<P>
They are angry that state or Indiana County officials often charge the borough 
the same standard governmental fees paid by larger communities, such as 
Indiana, the county seat of about 16,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Most public tasks, such as patching a municipal road, are too small for local 
contractors to bother with, Gryczuk said. Bigger projects would jolt the 
municipal budget and the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait three or four years to accumulate enough money to get a road 
fixed," Gryczuk said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also are worried about a potential financial knockout -- a 
longstanding demand by the state Department of Environmental Resources that 
Jacksonville install a sewer system to replace septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sewer Charges 
</P>
<P>
Josephine Stango said the latest estimates put the cost for sewers at about $40 
per month for each homeowner, mostly for interest on the capital expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
She said the borough doesn't have the money for engineering studies for the 
sewer project. Mary Grimm said most residents can't afford sewers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
At the Golden Pheasant tavern on the two-lane state highway, owner Eddie Sklar, 
himself a former councilman, worried that new talk of disbanding the 
municipality may cost him his liquor license eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my livelihood," he said. "I don't want to lose it." 
</P>
<P>
Sklar suggested that the borough can save money by asking homeowners to pay for 
the street lights near their homes and by asking neighboring townships to run 
their plows down Mill Street occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
He said council members should have installed sewers years ago, when costs 
would have been less. 
</P>
<P>
Sklar was instrumental in getting an oil driller to sink the community's water 
well just outside the borough line for free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acknowledges Difficulty 
</P>
<P>
But he concedes that running a little town is difficult. When he was a 
councilman more than a decade ago, for example, he recalls that the borough 
received $180 in revenue-sharing money, but had to spend $144 on a required 
newspaper advertisement to describe publicly how the money would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
Josephine Stango said officials are reluctant to break up the borough, which 
was founded in 1853 and named after President Andrew Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"We would never disband if it would hurt anybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with an eye on lowering taxes and benefiting from ample road equipment 
in neighboring municipalities, council members say they are considering 
overtures to officials of adjacent Black Lick and Young townships. 
</P>
<P>
"But who would take us?" Mary Grimm said. "We don't know."

EYE-OPENER AT DAD'S COFFEE SHOP ISN'T LIKELY TO BE FOUND AT MOM'S

<P>
The question before the court remains: What is entertainment? 
</P>
<P>
It is a subject discussed the livelong day in this gritty little town of 6,700 
in the Pennsylvania hills, especially over the plywood counter of Dad's Coffee 
Shop, an unremarkable establishment in every respect save one. At Dad's, the 
waitresses, who serve the coffee in Styrofoam cups, are naked from the waist 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. The law says they must wear what are called pasties, tiny 
stick-on things that glitter and seem to serve only to accentuate the obvious, 
and Dad says he insists on operating strictly within the law. 
</P>
<P>
Dad is Thomas Wasley Jr., a stout man of 46 with wire-rimmed glasses, thick 
black hair just going to gray and brown eyes that plead astonishment over the 
trouble that has befallen him. 
</P>
<P>
Wasley and his coffee shop came into prominence last May, during a local 
election campaign as it happened, which brought him more attention, and 
customers, than his small ads in the sports section of the Scrantonian Tribune 
ever produced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call From Australia 
</P>
<P>
"I even got a call from a radio station in Australia," he was saying the other 
day, over coffee. "I thought it was phony at first, but it wasn't. That's when 
I put up that map." 
</P>
<P>
The map of the United States is about the only thing that decorates the pale 
walls of the coffee shop. That and a bulletin board covered with newspaper 
clippings about the dispute over the meaning of entertainment. A legend above 
the map asks, "How far did you come to Dad's?" Pins are stuck in about a dozen 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Now business has fallen off from 500 or so customers a day to about 75, and the 
paper will no longer run Dad's ads. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I'm closed," Wasley said. "I'm struggling, but I'm not closed." 
</P>
<P>
Not closed, but subject to a fine of $500 a day since the city magistrate 
determined, in a 13-page decision rendered June 26, that Dad's Coffee Shop was 
providing "live entertainment" for which he needed a special permit under the 
zoning law. 
</P>
<P>
Wasley has appealed to a county court and says he will continue if necessary to 
appeal to higher courts on up the line. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate, John E. V. Pieski, ruled that since the zoning statute did not 
define "live entertainment" he would use the dictionary definition: "The act of 
diverting, amusing or causing someone's time to pass agreeably." 
</P>
<P>
"That would apply to cheerful waitresses at Dunkin' Donuts," says Wasley. 
</P>
<P>
But, argued the magistrate, Wasley advertised his waitresses, not his coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"So do the places that advertise their waitress-of-the-month instead of their 
food," says Wasley. 
</P>
<P>
But when Wasley's waitresses went from wearing swimsuits to baring their 
breasts, ruled the magistrate, the price of his coffee doubled to $2 a cup, no 
refills. A clear indication, he ruled, that Wasley considered them live 
entertainment and waitresses only incidentally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Overhead 
</P>
<P>
"All price reflects is overhead. You have to hire topless girls from out of 
town, pay agency fees, motel room costs. That still doesn't mean they 
constitute live entertainment," says Wasley. "They don't sing or dance. All 
they do is serve coffee." 
</P>
<P>
The debate lingers. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Maholic, the borough president, the dispute was more 
political than semantic. "If it were not an election year it would never have 
come up," he argues. 
</P>
<P>
The pot boiled over a few weeks before the May 16 Democratic primary when a 
group of residents presented to the council a petition with 1,100 signatures 
opposing Dad's "or any other enterprise of obscene nature." 
</P>
<P>
"In a town of 6,700," said Maholic, "1,000 names is a lot of voters." 
</P>
<P>
The resident who headed the petition drive, Frank Siderowicz, says there is 
nothing to the idea politics is involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a moral issue from the beginning," he insists. "We collected those 
signatures outside our churches after services. Politics was never mentioned. 
It was a coincidence that an election campaign was going on. 
</P>
<P>
"This is small-town America. A topless coffee shop doesn't fit." 
</P>
<P>
Dickson City is a small town all right, but hardly typical of what the phrase 
usually conveys. It abuts a string of similar communities just north of 
Scranton, suburbs really, whose varying ethnic makeups reflect the immigrant 
groups who arrived here years ago to dig coal. 
</P>
<P>
It is a town of seven churches and 15 taverns. It also features a topless go-go 
joint, The Rose, which is across the street from the borough hall, and a porno 
shop on a major highway that cuts through town. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of those places were objected to when they opened, but for some legal 
reasons they were allowed to remain," said Siderowicz. "Dad's Coffee Shop was 
something we could do something about, so we did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Ousted 
</P>
<P>
Siderowicz says it was also coincidental that the committee he headed to 
collect the signatures was a group called "Democrats for Good and Honest 
Government," formed specifically to oust the incumbents. And it did. All three 
who were running, including Maholic. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I wasn't the only loser," Wasley commented. "But if I were confronted 
with a petition like that outside of church with all those people standing 
around I'd have signed it myself." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from his current troubles, Tom Wasley's career as a restaurateur has not 
always been placid. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in Mayfield, the next town over, and in 1978 opened a short-order 
restaurant. It did well enough until two years later when an elderly customer 
mistook the gas pedal for the brake and drove his car through Wasley's front 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was hurt, but it killed my business. For some reason people didn't want 
to come anymore." 
</P>
<P>
So in 1985 he changed the operation. He borrowed money, put in a bar, hired 
bands and stayed open until 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"That," he said, "was my idea of live entertainment, and the results were 
terrible. I had to break up three or four fights every night and I had 11 
break-ins the first year. I started 1986 deep in debt and figured I'd have to 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine asked me if I ever thought of go-go girls. I told him I'd 
never even seen one. Besides, I couldn't see myself in the role. I'm a guy with 
a mother who sings in the choir and says the rosary every night and a son in 
parochial school. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I went with him to a go-go place in Scranton and nothing I thought would 
happen happened. It was great. The girls joked; the men behaved. I went three 
more times after that and finally decided to try it. 
</P>
<P>
"I tore up the floor where I had had a pool table and used it to build a stage, 
and hired two girls, one for the afternoon and one for the evening. No bands, 
just records. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a success from the first day. No fights, everybody just having fun. 
After two years I was finally back on my feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Then one night -- I wasn't even there at the time -- a young guy had to be 
ejected. He went out on the highway and was run over by a pickup truck and 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I swore right then I would never serve liquor again, never ever. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I got the idea for a coffee shop. A non-alcoholic place where 
adults could stop in and chat over coffee. No music, no entertainment. I opened 
last February and thought of it as an idea that might be copied all over the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy to Miss 
</P>
<P>
You would miss Dad's if you didn't know where it was. It is in a business 
complex just off Main Street but hidden behind a video store and a bank and 
squeezed between the Wah Yaon, a Chinese takeout joint, and the My Place Pizza 
parlor. Wasley has a deal with the pizza parlor. If one of his coffee customers 
wants a slice it comes via a pass-through cut in the dividing wall. Wasley 
jacks up the price a nickel and serves it. 
</P>
<P>
The front windows of Dad's are curtained and on the front door, also curtained, 
is a sticker that says "Say No to Drugs and Alcohol." A sign says "Must Be 18." 
"I card 'em," says Wasley. 
</P>
<P>
The inside is well lit. Wasley did the carpentry himself, a nondescript U-shape 
counter surrounded by 30 nondescript plastic-cushioned chairs. The waitress one 
recent afternoon, a blonde named Natasha, was not at all nondescript and was 
certainly diverting and seemed to enjoy chatting with the customers. 
</P>
<P>
There were only four at the time, all men in their 30s or 40s who managed not 
to stare. One, in fact, was reading a newspaper. Natasha did not appear at all 
self-conscious. The conversation was about the start of school. Natasha said 
she had just got her elder daughter enrolled in a school for kids with learning 
disabilities and was greatly relieved. 
</P>
<P>
She also said, with a sigh, that she hoped business would pick up after 5 when 
the men got off work and were thirsty for coffee. "Tips have been pretty scarce 
lately," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Natasha, are you entertainment? 
</P>
<P>
"Not here," she said. "I am at my other job. I dance. Here all I do is serve 
coffee." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bathing Suits 
</P>
<P>
When Wasley first opened Dad's the girls wore bathing suits. "A rumor got 
started, probably by some of my former go-go customers, that my waitresses were 
topless. I decided, if that's what they want, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Tina Wanis, 20, who is Wasley's fully clothed office manager, points out there 
is good money in the topless business although she would never do it herself. 
"I just couldn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We pay our girls $10 an hour. When we were going good they made another $50 to 
$60 on a six-hour shift in tips alone.

ASSIST DRUG USERS IN HEART OF ZURICH; 
</P>
<P>
SWISS TRY RADICAL APPROACH IN FIGHTING AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ZURICH, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days even the newcomer to Switzerland's most opulent city knows where to 
get a fix and shoot up in peace. 
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the year Zurich has set aside a zone where small-time drug 
dealing and taking are unofficially tolerated and monitored by medical 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has the highest rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 
Europe, and Zurich, the country's biggest drug-center, had to find a radical 
way to stop drug users from spreading the disease. 
</P>
<P>
However, a wave of drug-related crime -- culminating in a grisly murder -- 
threatens to intrude on a population that would rather be left to high finance 
and art-dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Zurich's junkies gather every day around a disused iron bandstand on the 
Platzspitz -- a spit of parkland bounded by two rivers but only 200 yards from 
the city's shopping and banking quarter -- to peddle, cook fixes and inject. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Syringes Exchanged 
</P>
<P>
In a converted public toilet, volunteers exchange fresh syringes for used ones, 
dispense sterile wipes and condoms and chat to the endless line of addicts at 
the window. 
</P>
<P>
Swapping syringes helps cut needle-sharing, one of the sure-fire ways to 
transmit AIDS. Authorities estimate Zurich has up to 800 carriers. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers distribute 6,000 needles a day. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, for most citizens the once-beloved park has become a no man's 
land, its name transformed into "Platzspritz" or "Needle Park." The tabloid 
Blick now refers to it as "Zurich's Drug Hell." 
</P>
<P>
While the city and federal governments approved funds for syringes and medical 
care for the addicts, police say this undermines the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Futility of Punishment 
</P>
<P>
Drug taking and dealing are strictly illegal, although a federal commission has 
acknowledged the futility of punishment and called for both to be legalized if 
the quantities are small. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not tolerate dealing . . . . The clear task of the police is to enforce 
the law. That goes from hashish to hard drugs," Arthur Grob, second-in-command 
of Zurich's drug police, told Reuters. "But the open drugs scene has political 
support through the help given on the Platzspitz." 
</P>
<P>
The city police say the park attracts drug tourism from all over Switzerland 
and Europe, with an inevitable rise in crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The Platzspitz is a magnet for people from all over . . . . There's been an 
increase in all crime from pickpocketing to burglary and robbery, much of it 
directly linked to drugs," Grob said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Resources 
</P>
<P>
He accepts there is little point in arresting small-time addicts. But many 
users sell to finance their habit, and police say they would arrest and charge 
all dealers if it weren't for the lack of resources. 
</P>
<P>
They would like the park cleared and the addicts dispersed. Every two weeks or 
so they raid the park, sealing off the area and checking the identity of 
everyone there. But they detain only suspected criminals on a wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
The contradiction between the strategies of police and the city council is 
evident. "It's politically very hard to carry out a raid when soup is just 
being dished out," Grob said. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers have protested against the police raids. 
</P>
<P>
"The drugs are injected too quickly out of fear. The incidence of respiratory 
and heart stoppages is mounting," one action group said in a protest letter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breakthrough in Treatment 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, who staff a bus where the junkies can socialize, argue the park 
is a breakthrough in treating addicts as human beings. 
</P>
<P>
However, Platzspitz doctor Claude Bossy admits: "Yes, there are fights, rapes, 
murders. The drug Mafia are never far away." 
</P>
<P>
The dividing line between life and death is thin on the Platzspitz. 
</P>
<P>
During a Reuter interview with Bossy an addict ran into the van to say another 
addict had overdosed and fallen unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
When the doctors reached the woman with an oxygen mask, she was shuddering 
violently, slumped on a bench, her eyes glazed. But repeated coaxing and 
mentions of her name penetrated the stupor and brought a hint of a nod. 
</P>
<P>
She was lucky and did not need resuscitating, as one or two addicts do every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficulty of Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Bossy explained the difficulty of treating overdoses when addicts have AIDS and 
suffer from a range of disorders that their immune systems cannot fend off. 
</P>
<P>
Business at the bandstand had not stopped. 
</P>
<P>
At messy tables some addicts offer a service to others -- new syringes, a spoon 
and a flame for dissolving the small brown cubes of heroin in water and gauze 
pads to filter the impure drug solution. 
</P>
<P>
They keep the gauzes. Their fee is the residue that, after ten or so 
filtrations, is enough for a fix. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the park, visitors to the stately neo-Gothic National Museum have a 
good view of the proceedings as they sip tea in its courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Putting Problem Out of Sight 
</P>
<P>
Grob sees the desire to put the drug problem out of sight as one factor behind 
the establishment of the Platzspitz. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone says, help them, yes. But not in my neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Bossy adds: "The politicians weren't unhappy to have them all somewhere where 
they aren't so conspicuous." 
</P>
<P>
But both admit bringing the "scene" into the open might make it easier for the 
first-time user to start taking drugs. 
</P>
<P>
An evaluation now in progress will show if costs to the city of about $600,000 
a year are helping to stop the spread of AIDS.

CUBA'S FREE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ADMIRED EVEN BY NATION'S DETRACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIONEL MARTIN, Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HAVANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government describes it as a miracle, visiting experts are impressed and 
even Cuba's political enemies do not deny the level, range and efficacy of its 
free cradle-to-grave medical care. 
</P>
<P>
What Dr. Hector Terry, vice minister of public health, describes as "a Cuban 
health care miracle" includes medical examinations, hospital and outpatient 
treatment, the most up-to-date surgical techniques and comprehensive dental 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how Cuba does it, Terry said the key is political will. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is infinitely richer than we are but it does not have the 
political will to provide the kind of free health care that we have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rural Deprivation 
</P>
<P>
There was no political will in pre-revolutionary Cuba, Terry said, when 
millions in rural areas had little access to systematic medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early years of the revolution, when half of Cuba's 6,000 physicians 
fled the island, President Fidel Castro has dreamed of making his socialist 
nation, in his words, "a medical power." 
</P>
<P>
"Neither money nor resources were spared, although perhaps it meant a somewhat 
lower standard of living in other respects," Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet aid over the last 30 years has made the public health system financially 
possible, according to Western observers. 
</P>
<P>
"The millions of dollars of Soviet aid every day in the form of long-term 
credits, preferential prices and free military hardware allowed Cuba to invest 
huge resources in public health," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficulties Seen 
</P>
<P>
"If Soviet aid diminishes over the next decade, as it is expected to do, it 
will be difficult for Cuba to maintain its current rate of investments in 
public health," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cuba owes Western creditors $6.4 billion, which it is unable to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban hospitals have diagnostic machines that cost $3 million each as well as 
the latest machines for the nonsurgical treatment of kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
This year more than 3,600 physicians will qualify, more than all the doctors on 
the island in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Medical school is free except for textbooks, which are inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
36,600 Physicians 
</P>
<P>
The graduating class will bring the number of physicians to more than 36,6OO, 
or about 30 for every 10,000 Cubans. Four of 10 doctors are women. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the class of 1964, all medical school graduates have been 
required to work for the government-run health care system. Only a few private 
practitioners remain. 
</P>
<P>
Most doctors work in one of the country's 882 hospitals or multipurpose 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years many new doctors have been assigned to the "family medicine 
plan." An idea of Castro, the plan aims to have all of Cuba covered by a 
network of neighborhood family doctors by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The 220 neighborhood family doctors working in Havana attend to the medical 
needs of about a quarter of the city's population. They live in the 
neighborhoods under their care in complexes with an office and apartments for 
the doctor and a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salary Structure 
</P>
<P>
Terry said that beyond political will and Soviet aid, the salary structure has 
played a major role in the success of the health services. "If we had to pay 
doctors and administrators exorbitant salaries, we would have never been able 
to afford our medical system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and dentists receive fixed monthly salaries. A general practitioner who 
has spent six years in medical school and three years in rural "social service" 
work is paid $433 a month. Dentists' salaries are similar. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Juan Aguilar, a leading orthodontist, said he remained in Cuba because of 
his conviction that he was contributing to the welfare of his people. "I know 
that I could be making $100,000 a year or more if I left Cuba, but it gives me 
great satisfaction to be able to treat so many people who would not be able to 
afford the services of an orthodontist in another country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salaries Are Good 
</P>
<P>
By Cuban standards salaries of doctors and dentists are good -- about twice the 
average monthly wage. 
</P>
<P>
Terry said that to progress the way it has, the health care system had to cut 
its dependence on drugs bought from multinational corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"Medicines on the world market are exorbitantly priced. You cannot develop a 
health care service like ours without having a pharmaceutical industry," he 
said. "Besides, because of its economic embargo, the United States has refused 
to sell us even an aspirin over the past 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Today 85% of the medicines used by the public health service are produced 
within Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genetic Techniques 
</P>
<P>
Cuba uses genetic engineering techniques to produce reagents, such as those 
used for testing AIDS, said Terry, who heads the National Commission on AIDS. 
Half the population has been tested for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban hospitals can perform heart, liver, kidney and lung transplants, and 
neural transplants for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. They offer 
prenatal diagnosis for genetic malformations and Down's Syndrome. There is an 
aggressive program for detecting breast and cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Terry points with pride to the declining infant mortality rate, an important 
public health measurement. The rate dropped to below 12 per 1,000 live births 
last year from 60 or more in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"Our population is also living 10 years longer than it did back 30 years ago," 
he said. "Not bad for a Third World country."

SATELLITES MAY BE USED TO SPOT SALMON POACHERS;

<P>
NEW AGREEMENT AIMED AT FISH RUSTLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The vast waters of the North Pacific cover an area the size of the continental 
United States, and a Coast Guard patrol plane could fly for hours without 
detecting one of the rogue fishing vessels said to be illegally catching salmon 
in international waters. 
</P>
<P>
But on the heels of an elaborate high-seas "sting" operation, which netted a 
ring of alleged fish rustlers in July, comes a new accord that will give the 
federal government greater power to control salmon poaching. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the first time, "fish cops" working for the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration may soon be keeping track of the exact location of 
hundreds of foreign vessels by using satellites to monitor their positions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Satellite Transmitters 
</P>
<P>
After years of touchy negotiations, the U.S. State Department and Taiwan have 
reached an agreement requiring fishing boats in the North Pacific to carry 
satellite transmitters. The devices will be monitored by NOAA satellites so 
that special agents can turn on a computer in Washington and observe the 
locations of fishing boats, said Steve Springer of NOAA Fisheries Office of 
Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The accords deal with foreign vessels that use "drift nets." These fine-mesh 
nets can stretch 40 miles, about the distance between Washington and Baltimore. 
The nets are used by Taiwan, South Korea and Japan to catch squid at night, but 
they also trap anything else that swims into them. 
</P>
<P>
Because the nets are indiscriminate killers, and are capable of ensnaring not 
only squid, but salmon, seals, dolphins and sea birds, environmentalists have 
called them "curtains of death." 
</P>
<P>
"You put up a fine-mesh net between here and Baltimore and see how many birds 
you catch," said George Herrfurth of NOAA Fisheries Office of International 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Creeping North 
</P>
<P>
The drift-net fishing boats are supposed to stay below certain northern 
latitudes where salmon are commonly found. But in recent years, NOAA fisheries 
agents have suspected that many squid boats are creeping into the far North 
Pacific waters and using drift nets on salmon. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal salmon catches are then "laundered" through middlemen and sold to 
foreign or domestic buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government considers all salmon that spawn in the rivers of the 
Pacific Northwest and Alaska to belong to U.S. fishermen, who net the fish on 
their return to the streams where they were born. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. fishermen and members of Congress have charged that poaching by foreign 
vessel is depleting salmon stocks, a $1-billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fishing 'Sting' Operation 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Taiwan comes days before a deadline stipulated by the Drift 
Net Act of 1987, and follows the "sting" operation aimed at Taiwanese fish 
brokers who were allegedly trying to sell illegally netted salmon to NOAA 
undercover agents in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The project culminated in a dramatic, high-seas chase that lasted several 
weeks, as two fleeing Taiwanese drift-net vessels allegedly in league with the 
fish dealers in Seattle were pursued across the Pacific Ocean by a Coast Guard 
cutter. 
</P>
<P>
As important as the use of satellites, the new agreements will allow federal 
agents to board and inspect foreign vessels in international waters. Boarding 
boats on the open seas is an intrusion zealously opposed by most captains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catch Must Be Recorded 
</P>
<P>
The accords also require that observers record what foreign fishermen pull up 
in their nets, so for the first time impartial counts can be made of what is 
hauled up from the deep. 
</P>
<P>
"The accord gives us an unprecedented amount of information on the drift-net 
fishery," said Larry Smead, director of the State Department Office of 
Fisheries Affairs, which conducted the talks along with NOAA and the Coast 
Guard.

UNIQUE TECHNIQUE IN NETHERLANDS;

SERGEANT SNIFFS OUT WAY TO ID SUSPECTS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Sgt. Jan de Bruin proudly displays his collection of glass jars, each 
containing the scent of a robber, a rapist or a killer. 
</P>
<P>
The scents, extracted from objects on the scene of a crime or from human 
subjects, could help Rotterdam's police dogs sniff out some of the city's most 
dangerous criminals. 
</P>
<P>
In his new "smell bank," the first of its kind in the West, De Bruin already 
has about 40 samples that he can preserve for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to build the collection to about 300 samples, providing Rotterdam 
police with a unique addition to their criminal files. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has a different smell that a dog can recognize," said De Bruin, 48, 
who has devoted the last 12 years to perfecting the science of collecting and 
storing human odors. He is technical director of Rotterdam's police dog unit. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are impressed by De Bruin's work, which they say could provide vital 
clues for criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Other Dutch police forces are envious of Rotterdam's $700,000 smell bank, while 
canine experts in other European countries and the United States are intrigued 
by his methods. 
</P>
<P>
When a serious crime, such as a murder or bank robbery, occurs in Rotterdam, De 
Bruin is called to the scene with his homemade scent-extraction kit. 
</P>
<P>
He wraps any article bearing traces of the criminal's personal odor in a 
sterilized cotton cloth and places it in a large plastic ventilation box, 
equipped with an electric fan. 
</P>
<P>
As air blows through the box, scent molecules from the object evaporate and are 
absorbed by the cotton. 
</P>
<P>
After 20 minutes, the cloth is transferred to an airtight storage jar, labeled 
with the date and place of the crime, and stored in a room especially reserved 
for De Bruin's collection. 
</P>
<P>
"This sample was taken from the glove of a bank robber," De Bruin told a 
reporter, pointing to one of the jars, the sort more commonly used for 
preserving fruit and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Another sample came from a cigarette lighter, carelessly dropped by a murderer 
as he fled. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole human body is a source of odors. We leave behind scent molecules 
wherever we go," De Bruin said, noting that he also gathered odor traces 
directly from human skin. 
</P>
<P>
When major crime suspects in Rotterdam are arrested, they are photographed and 
fingerprinted on arrival at a police station. But they also have to provide a 
scent sample by holding one of De Bruin's special cloths for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In his experiments, dogs have accurately identified people from a scent sample 
taken three years ago, but De Bruin believes the specimens could last much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"De Bruin's techniques are quite new and could be very helpful to police," said 
chemist Jan Schaefer, an odor specialist at the TNO private research institute 
in Zeist, who advised De Bruin on his research. 
</P>
<P>
Police have traditionally used trained dogs to help track down or identify 
criminals, using the scent of an object belonging to the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said, however, that only highly trained dogs can match a human odor to 
its owner, and even the most skilled animals make mistakes if improperly 
handled. 
</P>
<P>
He said the most commonly used police identification test, in which a dog 
selects a culprit from a line-up of suspects, is unreliable because humans 
under stress emit different body odors. 
</P>
<P>
It was such flaws that spurred De Bruin, who has worked with dogs for more than 
30 years, to devise more scientific ways of putting his canine colleagues to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Besides creating his smell bank, De Bruin introduced more sophisticated 
detection tests. Instead of a row of people, he presents the dog with a row of 
glass jars containing cloth odor samples, taken earlier from participants in 
the test.

BOSTON U WILL OPERATE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN 10-YEAR EXPERIMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When public school students returned to class there was something else beyond 
the usual change of new classes, new teachers and new books. There also was a 
new administration, run by Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
After months of sometimes bitter controversy, the private university was at the 
helm of the Chelsea public school system. It is the beginning of a 10-year 
experiment to see if academia's resources can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Christmas morning and we're ready to go," said Ted Sharp, an 
assistant dean at BU's School of Education, on the first day of classes earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fanfare, there was little evidence of the university's new role. 
Signs welcomed students and university officials in Vietnamese, Cambodian and 
Spanish, reflecting the native tongues of a third of the student body. 
</P>
<P>
There also was talk of a new computer system and a special program for truants. 
But the university has longer-term goals than improving attendance or school 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
University officials talk of creating a new climate in this working-class 
community of 26,000. There are plans to teach parents about nutrition, child 
care, even neonatal care, with the idea of preparing children for school long 
before they can read or write. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a philosophy that education can emancipate the underclass 
in the United States," said Peter Greer, dean of education who oversees the 
management team. 
</P>
<P>
But there are many who still have doubts about the university's involvement in 
the local schools. The teachers' union and Latino parents have filed separate 
suits challenging the agreement. Others are worried the city may be left in 
deeper debt if the university doesn't raise the $2 million to $3 million it 
promised for special programs this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned we may get stuck if the money doesn't come in," said Elizabeth 
McBride, chairwoman of the Chelsea School Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The unique agreement between the university and Chelsea follows years of hard 
times for the 3,500-student system. An influx of immigrants from Latin America 
and Southeast Asia swelled the school population; declining tax revenues cut 
school budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Chelsea spends $1,600 less per student annually than the national average. Test 
scores, graduation rates and teacher salaries are among the state's lowest. 
</P>
<P>
School committee members sought help by approaching John Silber, president of 
Boston University, who has long sought to use his school's resources in public 
education. After months of negotiations among the school committee, aldermen 
and the Legislature, an agreement was reached in June giving the university 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Althoug planners have talked about new courses and individualized teaching 
plans, an emphasis has been placed on preparing children and their parents for 
school. Last spring, the university experimented with a literacy program for 
mothers and their young children. 
</P>
<P>
There are other plans for parental courses in nutrition, and classes for 
expectant mothers, all aimed at improving the health of future students. 
</P>
<P>
But the ambitious plans require money. University officials talked of raising 
$50 million through the life of its contract with Chelsea. More money is 
expected, but only $726,000 in pledges are in hand. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other concerns. Chelsea's teachers are mindful of Silber's stormy 
relations with his university's unions; Latinos, fearful that the new 
management might end bilingual education, went to court to try to stop the 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The university has tried to soothe those fears, appointing a management team 
with several bilingual experts, including Diana Lam, a Peruvian-born Boston 
school administrator, picked to be Chelsea's new school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The union has signed an interim contract with BU that gives teachers an average 
bonus of $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some apprehension on the part of the teachers," said Edwin 
Weinstein, head of the Chelsea Teachers Union. "Now they've adopted a 
wait-and-see attitude."

POLLUTANTS IMPERIL WEST-GERMAN WATER

HAMBURG, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Germany, a country where it rains every third day on average, could be 
headed for a shortage of drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides and fertilizers from the nation's farms and airborne pollutants that 
seep into the earth with every rain are threatening the reservoirs of West 
Germany's 3,600 water companies. 
</P>
<P>
In rural areas in particular, the incidence of certain toxins is so high that 
wells have had to be closed. Tanker trucks now are the only source of drinking 
water for some isolated villages. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and ecologists report that the country is "poisoning its wells" and 
warn that the result, if the process goes unchecked, will be an acute shortage 
of potable water. 
</P>
<P>
The government line, as presented by Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle, is 
that toxic trace elements to be found in ground water "represent no danger to 
health." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's administration, keen to be seen as the ecological 
motor of the European Community, finds itself under pressure from Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The EC Executive Commission is threatening to go before the European Court at 
Luxembourg if West Germany continues to balk at enforcing agreed-upon, European 
Communitywide water standards. 
</P>
<P>
Regulations in force since 1986 forbid more than 50 milligrams of nitrate per 
quart of drinking water, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
But water samples show that nitrate, a byproduct of over-fertilization with 
liquid manure, is present in more than double the allowed concentration in some 
West German regions. 
</P>
<P>
In southwest Germany authorities have had to plug 150 wells, and countless 
other nitrate-tainted wells are in service only because officials have issued 
special exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrate, once in the human body, becomes nitrite, a substance that can trigger 
strangulation among infants. It also metamorphoses into nitrosamine, a cancer 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this month, EC regulations will prescribe a pesticide ceiling of 0.1 
micrograms per substance in a quart of drinking water -- with a combined limit 
of 0.5 micrograms per quart. 
</P>
<P>
Only one water company in five in West Germany is currently able to meet that 
requirement -- and here, too, Bonn has promised exemptions of up to 10 years, 
during which time toxin levels can legally exceed the EC ceiling by as much as 
20 times. 
</P>
<P>
Water from the Haltern Water Co., which supplies some 1 million people in the 
industrial Ruhr area, has eight times the pesticide level allowed under the 
approaching EC regulations. Shutting down the facility would bring on the 
collapse of the water system in Europe's most heavily populated region. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main problem is that we never find the chief culprits," reports Wolfram 
Such from the Siegburg Water Reservoir Assn. near Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Tests show high concentrations of the herbicide Diuron in Siegburg-area water. 
But farmers in the region deny using Diuron. 
</P>
<P>
Experts harbor no doubts that the farmers are the worst polluters of West 
Germany's water supplies. About 30,000 tons of highly poisonous pesticides and 
herbicides are sprayed onto the country's fields each year. More toxins come 
from liquid manure from cattle farms. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers resist pressure for change and instead blame the EC's Common 
Agriculture Policy for pushing financial incentives for high-intensity crop 
production. 
</P>
<P>
One possible way out may be taking shape in the southwestern state of 
Baden-Wurttemberg, where the government now levies a tax on water consumption 
and passes the money on to those farmers who can prove they do not use 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
If the scheme is shown to reduce pollution levels, Bonn plans to introduce the 
system nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, though, drinking water supplies face other threats. 
</P>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide and heavy metals from industrial and motor vehicle emissions 
enter the ground along with rainwater and make their way from there via brooks 
and streams to the reservoirs.

TIM WENGERD; PREMIER GRAHAM DANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Wengerd, a devotee of Martha Graham, a leading interpreter of her works and 
a dancer who spent much of the last five years choreographing performances 
aimed at calling attention to the scourge of AIDS, has died of that illness at 
his Albuquerque, N.M., home. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported in its Friday editions that he had died Sept. 12 at 
age 44. 
</P>
<P>
Called by celebrated dance critic Walter Terry the "most valuable and 
versatile" dancer in the Graham company, Wengerd more recently had been 
conducting workshops throughout the country, including several in San Diego, 
where he had become the West Coast guru of the Graham movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I can't get away from Martha," he said half-seriously in one recent 
interview, even as he was preparing a concert of his own solo works at San 
Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
From 1973 until he left her company in 1982, Wengerd danced virtually every 
leading male role in that repertory, enchanting audiences with his technique, 
intensity and physical attractiveness. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Los Angeles Times dance writer Eileen Sondak said Wengerd's own work 
showed touches of Graham, "but it also reflects a quiet rebellion from the 
brand of angst-filled psychodrama he learned from the acknowledged goddess of 
modern dance." 
</P>
<P>
The inspiration for Wengerd's own stark works -- some of which utilized bones 
and sparse body coverings -- came from his roots in New Mexico, where he first 
studied dance with Elizabeth Waters. He combined the elements of mountains and 
deserts with African dress "to connect with the past." 
</P>
<P>
The music for those movements came from taping "the sound of clacking rocks and 
wind inside the (New Mexico) cave." 
</P>
<P>
He coupled such avant-garde phenomena as "The Bone Cantata" with tranquil 
interpretations of Brahms, balancing that with John Cage's "Four Sonatas for 
Prepared Piano." 
</P>
<P>
Wengerd came to national attention when he toured in the late 1960s with the 
Repertory Dance Theater of Utah, a group he helped found in 1966, three years 
before graduating from the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Massachusetts and raised in Albuquerque, where his father was a 
geologist. After studying with Waters, he danced in Utah while attending 
college and at the same time pursued an interest in choreography that had 
surfaced in high school. In 1982, Wengerd went to Europe, where he taught and 
performed his own works and became an assistant director of the Paris Opera 
Ballet's modern dance troupe. He then went to Tanzania for the State Department 
and returned to the United States to appear in solo concerts, rare in the 
ballet world, and in Martha Clarke's "Garden of Earthly Delights." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall he appeared in San Diego in his "Free Among the Dead," which he 
called a response to the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"People I've danced with have died from AIDS," he said in an interview in 
connection with the four-concert series. "I'm more alive when I'm dancing than 
any other time, and it's easy to translate my experience with AIDS into dance." 
</P>
<P>
He observed at that time, however, that he didn't have the disease.

EXPERIMENT IN SMOG TANK IS LIKE A BREATH OF FOUL AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MICHAEL C. TIPPING, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even on those rare days when the air in the Los Angeles Basin is pristine, some 
people may still be suffering from a second-stage smog alert -- in an 
8-foot-by-8-foot room in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
In an unassuming office on the periphery of the UCLA campus and across from the 
sprawling National Cemetery, people are hermetically sealed inside a chamber 
pumped full of enough ozone, sulfur dioxide and other crud to make the lungs 
scream for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Henry Gong Jr., a UCLA professor and respiratory researcher, envisioned and 
built his "smog chamber" earlier this year to "try to simulate what happens on 
a typically smoggy day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filtered Air 
</P>
<P>
The chamber, formally called an Environmental Exposure Laboratory, is an 
airtight cube of Plexiglas and plastic foam insulation fed by a $40,000 
air-conditioning system that allows Gong and his two assistants to "dial in" 
the temperature and humidity. The incoming air is first filtered to a pure 
state, then mixed with such smog ingredients as ozone, sulfur dioxide or 
"whatever you like," Gong said. 
</P>
<P>
He can mix up a stew of pollutants that corresponds with the air during a 
first-stage or second-stage smog alert. He keeps the artificial smog to a 
"real-world range," however, because "we don't want to overdose anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers spend one or two hours in the chamber, alternately resting and 
exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
Other studies have measured and drawn conclusions about the long-term health 
detriments of smog, but Gong wanted to see what happens to people as soon as 
they get a hefty dose of pollution, particularly during exertion on a warm day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Experience 
</P>
<P>
The results should sound familiar to anyone who has worked out, or even taken a 
brisk walk, during a brown-air day. 
</P>
<P>
Most test subjects experience "chest tightness, a little pain on inhalation. 
(Some get) a dry cough, because ozone is a very strong irritant of the airways. 
Some people may develop wheezing," Gong said. 
</P>
<P>
Test subjects have their breathing measured when they emerge from the smog 
chamber. Gong said most bounce back to normal range within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Data is still being analyzed from a series of tests on people who also were 
part of a 10-year study on the long-term effects of smog. The subjects were 
among 345 adults from the smog-afflicted San Gabriel Valley community of 
Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term study found the Glendora group had a faster decline in lung 
function than a matching group of residents in relatively smog-free Lancaster 
in the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing Predictions 
</P>
<P>
The whole point of subjecting the same people to the acute effects of smog in 
the chamber "was to see if we could predict who would have a rapid decline in 
lung function," Gong said. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal pollution regulators are funding Gong's smog chamber studies 
and he said the results will have far more than academic interest. 
</P>
<P>
By precisely measuring how much smog does how much damage to people's lungs, 
Gong provides regulators with the data they need to evaluate the accuracy of 
current smog-level criteria and whether the threshold for smog alerts should be 
raised or lowered. 
</P>
<P>
And, he points out, any tinkering with the notion of how much smog is bad smog 
could have massive implications for industry, transportation and life styles as 
regulators begin imposing their 20-year Air Quality Management Plan to clean up 
the air in Southern California, typically the foulest in the nation.

WASHINGTON ROUTED BY INSPIRED COLORADO

The fifth-ranked Colorado Buffaloes showed what effect the death of 21-year-old 
quarterback Sal Aunese would have on them. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes went out and played their best game of the season and defeated 
No. 21 Washington, 45-28, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"This exceeded anything I'd hoped for," Coach Bill McCartney. "This speaks a 
lot about the intensity and resolve of our players." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese, Colorado's starting quarterback last season, died last Saturday night 
after a six-month battle against inoperable stomach cancer. His funeral was 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes knelt before their game in a tribute to Aunese. Then they went 
out and played like a team determined to win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Against a perennial Pacific 10 contender, the Buffaloes of the Big Eight 
overcame a 3-0 deficit in the first quarter to score the second-most points 
ever by a Washington opponent at 69-year-old Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
USC defeated the Huskies, 48-0, in Seattle in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said before Saturday's game that he wasn't sure how his players, who 
were off last weekend, would respond to the death. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterback Darian Hagan said: "I was down when I heard about Sal, 
but I was fired up at the funeral. I wanted to come here and get a big victory 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
After failing to get a first down in its first two possessions, Colorado scored 
the first of its six touchdowns on the ground on a 35-yard run by Eric Bieniemy 
at 11:53 and the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-point margin of victory by the Buffaloes (4-0) was deceiving. Colorado 
outclassed the Huskies both on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (2-2) trailed, 38-6, after three quarters and scored three 
touchdowns against Colorado reserves in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Washington quarterback Cary Conklin, who was intercepted three times, twice by 
strong safety Bruce Young, said, "It was a frustrating day." 
</P>
<P>
With Hagan directing Colorado's run-oriented wishbone offense, the Buffaloes 
rolled up 420 yards on the ground and 485 total yards. On defense, the 
Buffaloes' first unit held Washington to a pair of field goals by John McCallum 
until the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bieniemy scored two touchdowns, the second on a one-yard run in the second 
quarter. Then, in order, Flannigan scored on a three-yard run in the second, 
Hagan scored on a three-yard run in the third, wide receiver Jeff Campbell 
scored on a 56-yard reverse in the third and backup quarterback Charles Johnson 
scored on a 16-yard run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Culbertson kicked a 43-yard field goal for the Buffaloes in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Washington scored its touchdowns in the fourth quarter on a 15-yard pass from 
Conklin to Mario Bailey, when tight end Bill Ames fell on a Bailey fumble in 
the end zone after a 25-yard reception from Conklin and on a seven-yard run by 
Greg Lewis. Before that, McCallum kicked field goals of 21 and 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was ranked 11th in the nation a week ago before losing, 17-14, to 
Arizona in its Pac-10 opener.

Oregon State lost to third-ranked Nebraska, 35-7, Saturday in a game that was 
closer than the score indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers trailed, 21-7, after Pat Chaffey scored on a two-yard run with 2:10 
left in the third quarter, and if it hadn't been for three Oregon State 
turnovers, it could have been close to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska scored after all three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska, ranked second nationally in rushing with an average of 394 yards per 
game, managed only 193 yards through three quarters. Nebraska finished with 278 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Gerry Gdowski ran for one touchdown and passed for another to lead 
the Cornhuskers (4-0) over the Beavers (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne sounded as if his team had lost. "Hang with us, 
don't give up on us," he said. "We're going to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Gdowski ran seven yards for Nebraska's first score as he capped the opening 
42-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Carpenter added an eight-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter 
after a fumble recovery by Nebraska's Mike Petko at the Oregon State 35. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Pickens intercepted a pass by Nick Schichtle to end an Oregon State drive 
in the third quarter. Nebraska's Richard Bell then went 48 yards to help set up 
a two-yard touchdown run by Ken Clark to give the Cornhuskers a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey's touchdown came after Schichtle threw 39 yards to Maurice Wilson and 
had 16-yard completions to Jason Kent and Phil Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Gdowski then found Jon Bostick on a 60-yard touchdown pass play just over a 
minute after Husker safety Reggie Cooper intercepted another pass by Schichtle. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterback Mike Grant added another Nebraska touchdown when he 
passed nine yards to Mark Dowse with 4:34 to play.

Everett Lampkins intercepted a pass by Steve Smith and returned it 39 yards for 
a touchdown in the fourth quarter as San Jose State defeated Stanford, 40-33, 
Saturday at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
With 5:21 remaining, Stanford's John Hopkins, who kicked four field goals, made 
a 46-yarder to pull the Cardinal within six points, but San Jose held on for 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
A 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Veatch to Doug Hooker was ruled caught after 
pass interference by Stanford's Kevin Scott, putting San Jose in front, 34-30. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came after much discussion and no initial touchdown signal. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the interference, I can't argue that because it's the official's 
call," Scott said. "But when they gave him the touchdown. He didn't catch the 
ball, it hit the ground. And I was in front of him, so I don't see how I could 
have interfered with him." 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State is 2-1. Stanford, which plays host to Notre Dame next Saturday, 
fell to 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, after trailing 17-0, beat Oregon, 18-17, last week on a 37-yard field 
goal with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford came up short against San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford turnovers led to the first two San Jose touchdowns, both eight-yard 
scoring runs by Sheldon Canley. 
</P>
<P>
The first Stanford touchdown came after Tony Trousset intercepted a bomb by 
Veatch at the Stanford 13. The Cardinal moved the ball 87 yards in 10 plays and 
scored on a 23-yard pass from Smith to a diving Jon Pinckney. 
</P>
<P>
Smith connected for another touchdown in the first half, hitting Ed McCaffrey 
in the right side of the end zone from 17 yards out to put the Cardinal ahead, 
17-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans took a 21-17 lead on Veatch's 13-yard touchdown pass to Kevin 
Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins' 54-yard field goal, a career best, with two seconds remaining in the 
half cut the score to 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
McCaffery caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Smith in the third quarter to 
give the Cardinal a 27-21 advantage. A 39-yard scoring run by Veatch put San 
Jose State back on top, 28-27. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins, who kicked a 36-yard field goal three seconds into the second quarter 
for Stanford's first points of the game, made another 36-yard kick in the third 
quarter to give the Cardinal a 30-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona St. 19, Missouri 3 -- Jeff Simoneau scored two fourth-quarter 
touchdowns and David Winsley rushed for a career-high 134 yards as the Sun 
Devils beat the Tigers in a nonconference game at Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first win for the Sun Devils (3-1) over Missouri (1-3) since the 
1972 Fiesta Bowl. The Tigers had won the last two meetings by shutouts -- 9-0 
in 1974 at Columbia, Mo., and 15-0 at Tempe in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Zendejas kicked a 36-yard field goal with 12:14 left in the third quarter 
to put Arizona State ahead to stay at 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Simoneau scored on a four-yard run with 12:57 remaining and a one-yard plunge 
with 3:41 to play.

OREGON'S DEFENSE KEYS 16-10 UPSET

This time, the Ducks didn't let it slip away. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon had moved up and down the field all day Saturday against 17th-ranked 
Arizona but led by just six points. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats had the ball on the Oregon 42-yard line after an Oregon punt with 
2:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up 18 points in the last 7 1/2 minutes and losing, 18-17, on the 
final play last weekend against Stanford, the Ducks had an uncomfortable 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, the Oregon defense held, and the Ducks came away with a 
16-10 Pacific 10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Williams sacked Arizona's Ron Veal, the Wildcats were called for a 
delay-of-game penalty after their final timeout and the prospects for a 
game-winning drive dissolved in the Oregon mist. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg McCallum's three field goals proved to be the winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks, 3-1 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-10, grabbed a 13-0 lead in the first 
quarter and weathered a disastrous second period, when quarterback Bill 
Musgrave threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball away once. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona fell to 3-2 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Veal, who completed three of 16 passes for just 24 yards, credited the Oregon 
defense and the noisy Autzen Stadium crowd. His earlier timeouts left the 
Wildcats scrambling late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably should've appealed to the official a couple of times, instead of 
calling time out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said: "Oregon won the game up front. Both defenses won 
the game, but theirs barely outdid ours." 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave passed to Terry Obee for 50 yards on the game's first play from 
scrimmage to set a field goal. An interception by nose tackle David Cusano set 
up a one-yard touchdown pass to Kolya Tefft to give Oregon an early 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Another field goal made it 13-0 with 3:49 to play in the first quarter.

CLEMSON STUNNED BY DUKE

<P>
Duke Coach Steve Spurrier last week said his Blue Devils had a one-in-a-million 
chance of beating No. 7 Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
"We were probably the only ones that believed we could win," Spurrier said 
after Duke, a 15-point underdog, defeated Clemson, 21-17, Saturday in an 
Atlantic Coast Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before the game that we needed to get a lot of breaks, but we didn't 
get a whole bunch of breaks," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Billy Ray, a transfer from Alabama, completed 24 of 43 
passes for 262 yards and threw for two second-half touchdowns as the Blue 
Devils came back from a 14-0 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Ray threw five interceptions, three in the first half, but his seven-yard 
scoring pass to Chris Brown with 3:18 left was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Duke defeated Clemson was in 1980, when the Tigers were 2-9. They 
lost to the Blue Devils, 34-17, that year. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 2-3 overall, is 1-1 in the ACC. Clemson is 4-1 and 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Duke's first over a top-10 team since 1971, when the Blue 
Devils defeated ninth-ranked Stanford, 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
On the play before Duke's final touchdown, Spurrier noticed that Brown was 
open. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ray: "I just took a seven-step drop and looked left like I was going to 
throw it in the 30th row somewhere. Next thing you know, those linebackers had 
taken a fat drop. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned around, threw it and I just prayed to God he'd get in the end zone -- 
fall in if he had to -- and let us get up by four. By God, he did it." 
</P>
<P>
Duke went 72 yards in 11 plays for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson got as far as the Duke 38-yard line on its final possession, but it was 
unable to convert a fourth-and-12, and the Blue Devils got the ball back with 
less than a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the third quarter, Ray had a long pass intercepted by Clemson 
cornerback Dexter Davis, but Davis fumbled and Duke split end Darryl Clements 
recovered on the Clemson 23. Fullback Randy Cuthbert scored four plays later on 
a five-yard run with 7:53 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Duke tied the score, 14-14, with 2:09 to play in the third quarter on Ray's 
18-yard pass to Clarkston Hines, who broke the ACC receiving record of 2,431 
yards held by Wayne Baumgardner of Wake Forest. Hines, who had 96 yards 
Saturday, has 2,453 yards.

Ed Frazier kicked a 42-yard field goal as time expired to cap a 22-point 
comeback in the final 9:09 as No. 10 Pittsburgh tied No. 9 West Virginia, 
31-31, Saturday night at Morgantown, W. Va. 
</P>
<P>
Major Harris threw a career-high four touchdown passes and West Virginia 
capitalized on six Pitt turnovers to take a 31-9 lead late in the third quarter 
before the Panthers rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Walker ran two yards to cap an 80-yard scoring drive that made it 31-15 
and Eugene Napolean fumbled on West Virginia's next possession, allowing Alex 
Van Pelt to hit Henry Tooten with a nine-yard scoring pass with 4:41 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt (3-0-1) then pulled off a successful onside kick, setting up an apparent 
29-yard field goal by Frazier. But a roughing-the-kicker penalty kept the drive 
alive, and Curvin Richards made it 31-28 with a five-yard touchdown run with 
2:55 to play. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia (4-0-1) failed to run out the clock and had to punt with 49 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt, intercepted four times earlier in the game, hit Tooten with a 25-yard 
pass on fourth-and-eight to move the ball to the Mountaineers' 33. With seven 
seconds remaining, he found Tom Huebner open down the left sideline for eight 
yards, allowing Frazier, who earlier missed an extra point, to kick the tying 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Army 56, Harvard 28 -- Bryan McWilliams, Ben Barnett and Calvin Cass each 
scored on short runs in the second quarter, rallying the Cadets to victory at 
West Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard (1-2) surprised the Cadets with two first-quarter touchdowns to take a 
14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Tim Perry hit fullback Art McMahon with a five-yard pass touchdown 
pass for a 7-0 lead only 3:21 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard made it 14-0 less than two minutes later on a lucky bounce. Perry 
completed a 27-yard pass to halfback David Haller, but he fumbled at the Army 
13-yard line and teammate Mark Bianchi picked up the ball and ran it in for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cadets (2-1) scored seven straight touchdowns to secure their 10th 
consecutive win at Michie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island 18, Brown 13 -- Chris Poirier rushed for 190 yards and scored the 
go-ahead touchdown midway through the final period as the Rams rallied from a 
13-0 deficit at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island (2-2) won the Governor's Cup for the second straight year. Brown 
(0-3) lost its 12th consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Bucknell 36, Dartmouth 20 -- Scott Auchenbach threw three second-half touchdown 
passes and Dan Scocca ran for a career-high 126 yards and two touchdowns to 
lead the Bison at Lewisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Bucknell (2-1) scored 22 unanswered second-half points after trailing Dartmouth 
(1-2) by 20-14 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut 31, Yale 20 -- Matt DeGennaro passed for one touchdown and ran for 
another as the Huskies scored 31 unanswered points to win at New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman tailback Victor Taylor scored on touchdown runs of one and 11 yards as 
the Huskies (3-1) came back from a 7-0 deficit to lead 31-7 midway through the 
fourth quarter. The Bulldogs dropped to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Northeastern 20, Cornell 0 -- Sophomore quarterback Dan Daponde threw a pair of 
touchdown passes as the Huskies broke away from their wishbone offense and won 
at Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Daponde threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Scott Adams in the first 
quarter and then hit split end Jerey Sadberry for a 27-yard touchdown in the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore David Rusk kicked field goals of 25 and 35 yards as Northeastern 
improved to 3-1. Cornell slipped to 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Holy Cross 46, Princeton 0 -- Tom Ciaccio passed for 343 yards and Dave Murphy 
intercepted two passes to become the Division I-AA career leader as the 
Crusaders romped at Worcester, Mass.

<P>
Murphy's interceptions gave him 26, two more than Holy Cross' Bill McGovern and 
Isaac Holt of Alcorn State.

NORTH CAROLINA ST. GETS MOVING IN SECOND HALF

<P>
John Johnson's 60-yard interception return for a touchdown put life into 
sluggish North Carolina State, and the 15th-ranked Wolfpack pulled away from 
winless Kent State for a 42-22 victory Saturday night at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Until Johnson's return, the Wolfpack had been struggling to stop the Golden 
Flashes' offense and move consistently against the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Kent State, led by former North Carolina coach Dick Crum, scored on its opening 
drive, then rallied after deflecting a field goal attempt to get within 18-15 
after Patrick Young's touchdown pass to Shawn Barnes and a two-point conversion 
run 16 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
John Taylor blocked Preston Poag's punt at the N.C. State 28 to set up Young's 
touchdown pass to Mark Cunningham with 10:26 left in the third quarter for a 
22-18 edge. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State punted to Kent State after the ensuing kickoff, and two plays after 
the exchange, Young's pass for Barnes was intercepted by Johnson, who raced 
down the left side of the field to score and give N.C. State a 26-22 lead with 
9:10 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack scored on its next three possessions. Tyrone Jackson scored on a 
one-yard run late in the third quarter, and Damon Hartman kicked a 25-yard 
field goal with 10:07 remaining after N.C. State recovered a fumble by Young. 
</P>
<P>
Young lost another fumble to the Wolfpack, and on the next play, freshman 
Aubrey Shaw ran 48 yards for a touchdown on his first collegiate carry. 
</P>
<P>
Navy 12, North Carolina 7 -- James Bradley's 18-yard touchdown run put the 
Midshipmen ahead for the first time, and free safety Bob Weissenfels' 
interception in the end zone with 22 seconds left sealed the victory at Chapel 
Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's touchdown with 2:34 left capped an 80-yard drive for Navy (1-2), 
which had relied on field goals to stay in the game. The PAT run failed after 
Bradley's score. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended an eight-game losing streak for the Midshipmen. The Tar Heels 
are 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 24, William &amp; Mary 12 -- Quarterback Shawn Moore threw for one 
touchdown and ran for another score as the Cavaliers overcame a sluggish second 
half to win at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Moore had both scores in the first half as Virginia built a 21-6 lead by 
halftime en route to winning for the fourth consecutive time after a 
season-opening loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
William &amp; Mary (2-1-1) came into the game as the No. 19 team in Division 
I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 37, Cincinnati 17 -- Browning Nagle, who wasn't expected to start 
because of a toe injury, threw for 214 yards and two touchdowns as the 
Cardinals scored on four of its first five possessions to win at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Nagle suffered a severely sprained right toe in last week's loss to No. 9 West 
Virginia and was expected to be replaced by freshman Jeff Brohm. But Nagle was 
named the starter after pregame warmups and went on to complete 17 of 28 passes 
with no interceptions to lead the Cardinals (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati is 1-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Rice 17, Wake Forest 17 -- Wilson Hoyle kicked a 27-yard field goal on third 
down as time ran out, giving the winless Demon Deacons a tie with the Owls at 
Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Demon Deacons (1-3-1) took a 14-10 lead on Phil Barnhill's 13-yard 
touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl with 4:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
Rice (1-2-1) went ahead, 17-14, when quarterback Donald Hollas scored from the 
one. Rice drove from midfield after a 30-yard kickoff return by Trevor Cobb. 
Hollas kept the drive alive with a 10-yard run on a third-and-eight.

Dan McGwire threw for 510 yards and two touchdowns to lead San Diego State to a 
38-27 Western Athletic Conference victory over Utah Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 21-21, after three quarters, but San Diego State (1-2 
overall and 1-1 in the conference) scored 17 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Trakas' 26-yard field goal with 13:46 left put the Aztecs ahead for good, 
24-21. Ron Slack then scored on a two-yard run, and Darrin Wagner had a 19-yard 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner also had a 57-yard touchdown reception on a pass from McGwire and 
four-yard run, both in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After Wagner's 57-yard catch gave San Diego State a 14-13 early in the third 
quarter, the Utes (1-4, 0-2) came back with Darrel Hicks' 33-yard touchdown 
reception from Scott Mitchell to put the Utes ahead, 19-14. Clifton Smith then 
caught a two-point conversion pass from Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner's four-yard run tied the score, 21-21, with 7:12 left in the third 
quarter.

Tom Kite converted mistakes by Ireland's Christy O'Connor into a playoff 
victory Saturday to send the United States into the championship match in the 
Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-1 win over defending champion Ireland advanced the three-man U.S. team to 
today's 36-hole final against Japan, a 2-1 upset winner over England as cold, 
blustery winds scoured the Old Course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame it had to end on a catastrophe like that," Kite said after 
O'Connor put his ball into a stream on the first extra hole of the decisive 
match after they each finished 18 holes in 71. "But I'll take a win any way we 
can get it. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning ugly is a whole lot better than losing pretty any time." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia put the United States ahead by defeating Philip Walton, 
69-71, but Ronan Rafferty beat Curtis Strange with a 30-foot birdie putt on the 
final hole. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Britton, seeking his first victory in nine seasons on the PGA Tour, shot a 
nine-under-par 63 to take a four-stroke lead after three rounds of the Centel 
tournament at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Britton was at 16-under-par 200, within range of Jeff Sluman's 1985 tournament 
record of 269, after making nine birdies in a bogey-free round. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Black, who started the day one shot off the lead after consecutive 67s, 
had a 70 and was second at 204. Gary Hallberg shot a 66 and was third at 205. 
</P>
<P>
Second-round leader Tom Pernice Jr., Mike Reid and Bill Buttner were at 206. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel shot a five-under-par 67 to take a three-stroke lead over Pat 
Bradley after two rounds of the LPGA San Jose tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who has won three tournaments in the last two months, enters today's 
final round at 12-under-par 132, five shots better than the previous course 
record of 137 set by Sandra Haynie in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, third in money-winning on the LPGA tour this year, began the day with a 
one-stroke lead over Bradley after shooting a 65 Friday. Bradley, fourth on the 
tour in earnings this year, shot a 69 Saturday and was at 135. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Charles shot a two-under-par 70 to retain a one-shot lead over Butch Baird 
after two rounds of the $300,000 Space Coast Senior tournament at Melbourne, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Charles had four birdies and two bogeys to go eight under par at 136 in a brisk 
wind and thick rough at the Suntree Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Baird, who shot a 70, came to the final hole tied with Charles but took a 
bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dent, who had a 70, was next at 138.

JARRYD, GILBERT PREVAIL IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unseeded Anders Jarryd of Sweden upset fifth-seeded Kevin Curren, 3-6, 7-6 
(7-5), 7-5, Saturday to advance to the final of the $425,000 Volvo tennis 
tournament in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Jarryd will play third-seeded Brad Gilbert, who defeated Kelly Evernden of New 
Zealand, 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
Jarryd said he grew stronger as the match progressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up my game a little bit," he said. "This surface (an indoor 
rubberized sheet) suits my game very well. The way I'm playing now, I am very 
confident." 
</P>
<P>
After neither player broke serve in the second set, Jarryd took a 4-0 lead in 
the tiebreaker. Curren rallied to gain a 5-4 edge, but Jarryd evened the score 
with an unreturnable serve and then hit a cross-court backhand passing shot to 
win the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl, the world's top-ranked tennis player, defeated Jaime Yzaga of Peru, 
6-3, 6-3, to reach the final of a $255,000 tournament at Bordeaux, France. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl will meet second-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain in today's final. Sanchez 
defeated France's Jean-Philippe Fleurian, 6-7 (8-6), 6-4, 6-1, in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez had a tough time with Fleurian, who had previously upset third-seeded 
Horst Skoff of Austria and fifth-seeded Goran Prpic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the first-set tiebreaker, Sanchez held to win the second set. He 
then dominated the third set, winning six consecutive games after Fleurian held 
service in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doubting myself after the first set," Sanchez said. "But I felt I could 
win because I knew it would be difficult for him to keep up the pace." 
</P>
<P>
Said Fleurian: "I did very well in the first two sets, but my legs gave out." 
</P>
<P>
After struggling in the previous two tournaments, Lendl had no trouble beating 
the fourth-seeded Yzaga. In the first set, Lendl broke Yzaga's service in the 
third and ninth games when Yzaga faltered. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Guillermo Perez-Roldan, the seventh and only remaining seeded 
player, rallied to beat Pavel Vojtisek of West Germany, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, and 
reach the final of a $123,400 tournament at Palermo, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
He will face Paolo Cane of Italy, who defeated eighth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic 
of Yugoslavia, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova defeated Betsy Nagelsen, 6-2, 7-5, to win the women's 
tournament at Haverford, Pa., for the third consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
After three consecutive service breaks to start the match, Navratilova never 
again allowed Nagelsen a break point.

RACE IN 76TH HAS BEEN FAR FROM ORDINARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, her victory in August's special primary in the 
heavily Republican 76th Assembly District would have left GOP candidate Tricia 
Hunter with little to be concerned about as next week's runoff approaches -- 
except, perhaps, finding an apartment in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus in political circles is that Hunter -- whose pro-choice stance on 
abortion drew national attention to the race after last summer's U. S. Supreme 
Court ruling on the volatile issue -- will, indeed, need to turn her attention 
to such domestic matters after Tuesday's runoff against Democrat Jeannine 
Correia and two write-in candidates. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that there is any doubt about the outcome of the election in 
the conservative San Diego-Riverside County district reflects the peculiar 
nature of a race that has been anything but routine since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
Though Hunter is widely viewed as a prohibitive favorite to win the seat 
vacated by the June death of Assemblyman Bill Bradley (R-Escondido), many 
Republicans are discomforted by the write-in candidacy of Dick Lyles, a 
longtime GOP activist who finished a close second behind Hunter in the 
eight-candidate primary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Divisive Thing' 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Republican leaders lament that Lyles' write-in bid -- and its 
potential for splintering the GOP vote -- gives at least a glint of hope to 
Democrat Correia, whose chances normally would be negligible. The other 
write-in candidate, Lakeside accountant Kirby Bowser, also is a Republican, but 
he is a political unknown expected to have little impact on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very divisive thing for the party," said San Diego County Republican 
Chairman Bettie Kujawa. "The 76th is so strongly Republican that I don't think 
we have to seriously worry about keeping the seat. But what Lyles has done is 
create a little doubt where there should be none. I can't help but feeling that 
Dick's just a sore loser." 
</P>
<P>
The infighting within the Republican ranks escalated last Thursday when Hunter 
accused the National Rifle Assn. and the National Right to Life Committee of 
spending $163,000 between them in a series of last-minute "political hit 
pieces" that were scheduled to blanket the district on Lyles' behalf this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Source of Hunter's consternation was a purported schedule of 11 mailings, 
listed under the letterhead of the National Right to Life Committee. Spokesmen 
for the two organizations said they planned no such last-minute mailings, and 
the right-to-life group said the schedule was a fraudulent use of its 
letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lyles said he welcomed that level of support, but knew nothing of 
it and doubted it would materialize. If it did, Lyles said laughingly, it would 
be nothing short of a miracle in what had otherwise been a "grass-roots 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Very Confident' 
</P>
<P>
Like Kujawa, Hunter attributes Lyles' write-in candidacy to electoral sour 
grapes and his refusal to accept defeat in a race that he began as the clear 
front-runner after having spent nearly four years preparing for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still very confident, but by putting himself above the voters, Mr. Lyles 
is hurting the district and his own party," said Hunter, a 37-year-old Bonita 
nurse. "It's a small problem as far as I'm concerned. But it's a situation that 
shouldn't even exist. He claims to be a loyal Republican activist. But loyal 
Republicans don't do what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Refusing to be put on the defensive by Hunter's characterization of his 
candidacy, Lyles argues that he decided to continue his race beyond his primary 
loss in part because Hunter is "less the nominee of the Republican Party than 
she is the favorite" of pro-choice activists, many of them Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any doubt I got more Republican votes than she did," 
said Lyles, a 42-year-old management consultant from Poway. "When you figure in 
the other Republicans in the primary, you see that Hunter actually received a 
rather small minority of the (GOP) vote." 
</P>
<P>
The district's demographics, combined with several other factors -- notably, 
the primary's unusual format and the abortion issue's skewing of typical 
political alliances -- support that interpretation of Hunter's narrow 197-vote 
victory over Lyles, 14,885 votes to 14,688. 
</P>
<P>
Though the district has a 55%-32% Republican registration edge, the primary 
vote was divided among six Republicans and two Democrats, as well as two other 
GOP candidates who withdrew but whose names remained on the ballot. Moreover, 
with Hunter's pro-choice stance attracting traditional Democratic support, she 
was able to draw crossover votes because of unorthodox procedures governing 
special elections, in which all candidates of all parties appear on a single 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, however, has little patience with such analyses, saying simply, "All 
that matters is that I ran in the primary. I got the most votes. I won. Period. 
It's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modest Local Coverage 
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by the Hunter-Lyles split, Correia optimistically argues that 
Democrats have reason to regard her campaign as more than just the "usual lost 
cause." Conceding that Lyles' write-in bid is a boon to her own candidacy, 
Correia added: "I guess this is one time I'm rooting for a Republican -- up to 
a point!" 
</P>
<P>
During the frenetic primary, the 76th District contest drew extensive national 
news coverage as one of the first tests of the political fallout from the 
Supreme Court's July ruling giving states new powers to regulate abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the runoff has been rather somnolent, generating only modest local 
coverage as Lyles' longshot write-in candidacy -- combined with Hunter's and 
Correia's pro-choice agreement -- downplayed the philosophical split on 
abortion that made the primary so compelling. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there have been few forums or other public events in the two 
months since the primary, a fact that has done nothing to enhance voter 
interest in an election expected to draw a turnout even lower than the 
primary's dismal 20% figure. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the person least bothered by the race's diminished public profile is 
Hunter, who contributed to that shift by refusing to participate in any forum 
to which Lyles was invited. Faced with Hunter's intransigence, a number of 
community groups scrapped plans for debates, with one notable exception being a 
KPBS-TV forum whose producers proceeded with the three other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Lyles doesn't deserve to be up there with the Republican and Democratic 
nominees," Hunter said. "I already beat him. There's no point to continuing 
that part of the race. Besides, we debated often in the primary, and on 99% of 
the issues, we stand exactly the same." 
</P>
<P>
Though Hunter has drawn criticism for what some see as an undemocratic posture, 
her stance appears strategically unassailable in a district that stretches from 
the South Bay to northeastern San Diego County and into the desert communities 
of Riverside County. Having benefited from the saturation publicity that 
allowed her to catapult out of the middle of the pack in the primary, Hunter 
now stands to benefit more from a quiet runoff that dampens passions on all 
sides and by dismissing Lyles as an insignificant interloper. 
</P>
<P>
But, even as Hunter tries publicly to ignore Lyles, her campaign strategists 
have clearly treated him as a serious threat. A recent Hunter mailer harshly 
attacks Lyles, describing him as "the choice of the gun lobby, anti-choice 
extremists and the Sacramento Cavemen," with the last phrase applying to 
arch-conservatives in the Assembly Republican caucus. Another Hunter brochure 
pointedly reminds voters that Lyles was accused in the primary of overstating 
his educational and professional background, and concludes: "Don't be fooled by 
what Dick Lyles and his extremist supporters are trying to tell you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Core of 200 Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
"What Hunter is saying and what her people are doing are two different things," 
said Lyles aide Doug Perkins. "You bet they're worried. It's a horse race." 
</P>
<P>
Lyles himself, who began his write-in campaign by declaring his readiness "to 
climb a political mountain," professes to believe that "the summit is in sight" 
as the race enters its final days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still going to be very tough, and a write-in campaign is always sort of a 
wild card," Lyles said. "But I think it's clearly do-able." 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 16, Lyles had outspent Hunter, $288,888 to $244,391, although most 
of his money was spent in the primary, and Hunter also benefited from a 
$100,000 independent expenditure by the California Nurses Assn. Hunter is 
president of the state Nursing Board, a body to which she was appointed by Gov. 
George Deukmejian in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Since the primary, Lyles has focused almost exclusively on the grass-roots 
organizational work that, although always essential, is even more critical to 
the hopes of a candidate whose name does not even appear on the ballot. Backed 
by a core of about 200 volunteers, Lyles' strategists, patterning their 
campaign after the historic 1982 write-in victory of Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad), have directed an extensive telephone and mail blitz aimed at 
reminding voters that Lyles is still in the race and how to write in his name 
on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hunter, Lyles concedes that the two Republicans hold similar positions on 
most issues, with abortion and Hunter's support for a ban on assault rifles 
marking their two major ideological distinctions. However, Lyles also has 
sought to expand the abortion question into a "family values" issue that he 
argues crystallizes the candidates' differences. 
</P>
<P>
"While the family values I represent begin with my pro-life position, what I'd 
like to do in areas such as drugs and crime and education reinforce that," 
Lyles said. Among his proposals are ones calling for restructuring of school 
financing and withholding drivers' licenses from teen-agers convicted of 
drug-related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that she and Lyles hold "overlapping positions" on most such issues, 
Hunter says: "I'd gladly measure my values against his anytime. How can someone 
who likes to talk about fighting crime and respect for life reconcile that with 
selling assault weapons?" 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of her isolated liberal positions on high-profile issues, 
Hunter has been forced to fend off accusations that she is, as the conservative 
Young Americans for Freedom puts it, "a liberal wolf in sheep's clothing." Last 
summer, Republican Assembly Leader Ross Johnson, who sent out a primary 
fund-raising letter on Lyles behalf to GOP contributors, implied that Hunter 
was linked to "liberal special-interest groups and labor unions with close 
ties" to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solid GOP Credentials 
</P>
<P>
In fact, with the exception of abortion and the assault weapons issue, Hunter 
hews to fairly mainstream conservative Republican positions, as illustrated by 
her support of the death penalty, opposition to public employee strikes and 
backing of a constitutional amendment outlawing the burning of the American 
flag. Since her primary victory, most local elected Republicans have endorsed 
Hunter, including even Johnson and others who opposed her or kept her at arm's 
length in the August race. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hunter may have had trouble convincing some of her fellow Republicans 
of her solid GOP credentials, Democrat Correia, a 46-year-old instructor of the 
retarded, is gladly willing to concede the point. 
</P>
<P>
"Tricia and I agree on two things -- pro-choice and banning assault weapons," 
said Correia, a Poway resident who finished fifth in the primary behind four 
Republicans but, because of the race's peculiar format, nevertheless qualified 
for the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, on social, economic and other issues, she's a solid Republican," 
Correia added. "One advantage I'd have is that I could go to Sacramento and 
work with the Democratic majority in a much more effective manner." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that her slim chances hinge on a badly divided GOP vote, Correia 
has been unable to get Democratic leaders to share her perception that 
Tuesday's election represents "probably the best chance we're ever going to 
have in this district." With the party unwilling to commit scarce financial 
resources to what most regard as a long shot even with multiple Republicans in 
the race -- if not on the ballot -- Correia expects to spend only about $10,000 
in her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth candidate in the race, write-in Bowser, is a 29-year-old accountant 
who ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in Washington but was unknown to 
local Republican officials before his surprising entry in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the primary's low turnout reflects voters' dissatisfaction with 
the three other candidates, Bowser, who describes himself as a "progressive 
conservative," says he hopes to "get people interested by giving them a choice 
they didn't have" in August.

SANDS OF SAN LUIS REY: MINERS LEAVE FEW TRACKS FOR RIVER'S PROTECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The benign appearance of the riverbed belies the controversy that surrounds it: 
a river that is more often dry than wet, running more than 30 miles from the 
base of Palomar Mountain to the Pacific at Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
At its easternmost reaches, kids in swimming trunks, wearing old tennis shoes 
to protect their feet from the rocks, take innertube rides for short spurts of 
excitement. It runs along Indian reservations, posh golf resorts, thoroughbred 
horse ranches, unending fields of tomatoes and strawberries and an old 
California mission. At the west, it winds beside a junkyard before dissolving 
unspectacularly into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
To the passer-by, the river is perhaps most noteworthy for its banks of willows 
and cottonwoods. The more discerning wildlife expert values it as the seasonal 
nesting home to the least Bell's vireo, a small, gray songbird listed on state 
and national endangered species lists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coveted Natural Resource 
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, the river's rural neighbors prize it as a natural resource 
best left untouched by man. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not. The sandy bottom of the San Luis Rey River is being bulldozed, 
scooped, sifted and trucked by the hundreds of loads weekly to asphalt and 
concrete companies throughout San Diego County, feeding growth's insatiable 
appetite for raw building materials. 
</P>
<P>
Here, along the river, is 70% of the county's reserve of construction-quality 
sand available for commercial use. Today's riverbed may be, literally, 
tomorrow's new home foundation, swimming pool, stucco wall, tile roof and 
asphalt pothole patch. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the dilemma facing those who live near, or want to preserve, 
or want to use, the San Luis Rey River: how best to raid its rich sand deposits 
without disturbing its neighbors -- whether they be endangered songbirds or 
residents who sought out the rural ambience of a quiet life in the back 
country, punctuated instead now by the roar of a parade of sand and gravel 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
It is an issue that is pitting residents like Dominic Savoca against sandmen 
like Roger Gordon and professional bureaucrats like Ruth Potter and wildlife 
experts like Larry Salata. 
</P>
<P>
"In the time I've lived here -- 12 years -- they've gone from one or two mining 
operations to absolutely wild," says Savoca, an insurance salesman who thought 
his move to Bonsall from the Los Angeles area would spare him, among other 
things, commercial truck traffic and reward him with, among other things, a 
slice of nature. 
</P>
<P>
So upset is Savoca that, at his urging, a citizens' activist group, Bonsall 
Area for a Rural Community, has agreed to finance a professionally produced 
videotape of the river, shot both from the ground and from a helicopter, "to 
raise public awareness of what is happening to the San Luis Rey river basin." 
</P>
<P>
The video, expected to cost about $1,000, will be distributed to local 
libraries and a host of federal, state and county government agencies. Savoca 
wants to show them both the untouched, pristine banks of the river and active 
sand-mining operations. He says he is not only convinced that the public 
doesn't realize what's happening to the river, but that some government people 
who are supposed to be safeguarding the river don't fully comprehend the scope 
of the sand mining. 
</P>
<P>
There may be some support for his cynicism. No single government agency is 
charged with overseeing sand mining in the river, and the county of San Diego, 
which has the primary responsibility, is woefully undermanned to give the river 
the attention it deserves, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
No one is even sure how much sand is being taken out of the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the county is growing and it needs building material. That's 
fine," says Savoca. "But why can't the government and the businesses organize 
themselves and spread out the mining -- take some from this river, some from 
another? Why do they have to screw up an entire river?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Success Its Own Undoing? 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the river's own success story as a sand supply may be its own 
undoing. Government surveys of available construction-grade sand have 
identified the San Luis Rey River as the most extensive cache of available sand 
in the county, measured in the billions of tons as the material is washed down 
into the valley from the abutting range of hills and mountains, including 
Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
Sand is one of California's natural resources, and state policy allows it to be 
mined. Local governments -- in this case, the county of San Diego and the city 
of Oceanside -- are not allowed to prohibit sand mining and can only put 
restrictions on the operations when they issue permits. 
</P>
<P>
The legitimate sand miner has to jump through a series of bureaucratic hoops 
before he can turn his first shovel of sand. Among the agencies that either 
require permits or, at the least, monitor sand-mining operations are: 
</P>
<P>
* The local land-use agency, whether it be a city or a county, which sets the 
conditions and restrictions for sand mining -- including how much sand can be 
taken out, from where and the amount of truck traffic to be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
* The regional Water Quality Control Board, which raises an eyebrow whenever 
someone tinkers with stream beds or appears to be a potential polluter of the 
water, especially when mining goes below the river's water table. 
</P>
<P>
* The county Air Pollution Control District, which is concerned about the 
amount of sand dust being kicked up. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Assn. of Governments, which has no direct land-use control over 
the river but which, on behalf of local governments, suggests policy to balance 
the need of commercial sand miners against environmental concerns of the river. 
</P>
<P>
* The state Department of Fish and Game, which worries about the destruction of 
riparian habitat. Of special concern is the least Bell's vireo, which nests in 
the very willows and trees that bulldozers might knock over in their quest for 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
* The California Department of Transportation, which is concerned that, if too 
much sand is taken out of the river, highway bridge supports and abutments 
might become eroded and weakened. 
</P>
<P>
* The California Division of Mines and Geology, which, among other things, 
wants to make sure that, when a mining operation is completed, a reclamation 
plan is implemented to return the site to its original state. 
</P>
<P>
* The U.S. Soil Conservation Service, which is concerned whenever a river is 
tampered with because of the effect -- positive or negative -- it might have on 
soil erosion and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
* The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which doesn't care if sand is taken out of 
the river but wants to know if any sand is piled up in the riverbed during 
processing, because that is technically a discharge back into the river and 
comes under the governance of the federal Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
* The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which, on behalf of the Army Corps of 
Engineers, monitors whether riparian habitat is affected during any sand 
piling. 
</P>
<P>
* The Environmental Protection Agency, which concerns itself with a myriad of 
environmental laws and guidelines and is the ultimate federal authority when 
sand miners and the environment are at loggerheads. 
</P>
<P>
Just getting the initial go-ahead from the county requires an extensive 
environmental review, said Roger Gordon, who has gone through the process so he 
could extract sand from the river where it winds through Bonsall, not far from 
Savoca's home. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to do biological, archeological, traffic, historical, hydraulic, 
hydrologic and soil studies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Time for Monitoring 
</P>
<P>
Although nearly a dozen public agencies might have reason to look over sand 
miners' shoulders, government officials concede that they have little time, 
energy or money to do so. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 companies now take sand from the river, but the total amount of sand 
being taken out is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all these agencies involved, and still we can't seem to get a handle 
on sand mining," bemoaned Ruth Potter, senior regional planner for Sandag, the 
San Diego Assn. of Governments. "It's hard to even find out who's doing the 
sand mining, because the permits go with the property (owner), not the 
operator, and operators have come and gone," she said. (Property owners lease 
out or assign mining rights to contractors.) "I've checked with the county, but 
we just can't get a good fix on everyone who's out there. Sometimes we simply 
spot a sand truck leaving an area. Some companies seem to dig wherever and 
whenever they please. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Luis Rey is a strange area. A lot of them up there don't like 
regulations, and they go out and do what they feel they can get away with and 
later worry about how to deal with whatever problem there may be," Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even know how much sand is coming out of the river because no one 
will tell you. They don't want their competition to know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the county will limit the number of truckloads of sand any given 
operator is allowed to haul off the site any given day. Roger Gordon, for 
instance, says he is limited to 35 truckloads daily. 
</P>
<P>
But Sue Gray, the county's chief enforcement officer for building and zoning 
violations, says it is "difficult for us to know" if the companies are 
complying. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the staff to count the number of trucks coming out of any given 
site," she said. "We'll maybe spend an hour or two periodically (watching), and 
figure out a daily average. If we get complaints, we'll spend more time on it. 
And some pits have to maintain records of how many trucks leave." 
</P>
<P>
But, Gray added, "We don't have the manpower to monitor these operations on a 
weekly basis." 
</P>
<P>
The county has a mixed record for enforcement, having shut down some operations 
temporarily while they got proper permits, after the fact, and shutting down 
other operations altogether after they failed to come in compliance. How much 
sand was taken out of the river illegally is not known. 
</P>
<P>
Other operators say a few bad apples have tarnished the industry's reputation, 
and say they, by and large, are following the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Gordon readily acknowledges, for instance, that on some days he runs more 
than the 35 truckloads of sand he is allowed by his permit. But, on other days, 
he says, he sends fewer trucks out of the river bottom and, on balance, he says 
he is running his business within the permit guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projection of Need 
</P>
<P>
Bill Healy, deputy director for community planning at the county's Department 
of Planning and Land Use, said officials have asked the sand-mining industry to 
fund a $50,000 study to project sand extraction rates for the future, based on 
the expected needed for sand from the river. But so far the industry has not 
forwarded the money for the study. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do an inventory of the mineral deposits throughout the whole county 
and develop policies to reconcile the environmental sensitivities of the river 
with the need to mine the sand deposits in the river," he said. "There's no 
plan in existence that I know of that looks at the total amount of sand that 
can be extracted in any given year," Healy said. "But the supply won't dry up. 
The problem is finding where the deposits are located and determining the 
environmental impacts in removing those deposits." 
</P>
<P>
That's a concern of people like Larry Salata, a biologist with the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service and an expert on riparian habitats -- like that of the San 
Luis Rey River, which he knows intimately. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Salata has traveled the river and found sand-mining operations that he 
suspects may not be permitted and has passed the information on to the Corps of 
Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are at least two major sand-mining operations that are currently 
operating without the benefit of a Corps permit," he contends. "Maybe through 
ignorance, or for some other reason, they fail to coordinate with all the 
appropriate agencies." 
</P>
<P>
Corps of Engineers officials confirm receipt of Palata's complaint, but haven't 
had time to investigate the matter fully, they said. 
</P>
<P>
John Winn is the only Corps ecologist assigned to San Diego. He arrived about a 
month ago from Mobile, Ala., where he is permanently assigned, and expects to 
return there in another month or two. He's in San Diego only temporarily, 
filling a job that had gone unstaffed for several months before his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his time, Winn said, is spent inspecting housing developments to 
determine the effect -- including water and silt runoff -- they will have on 
streams, rivers and lagoons. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent a couple of hours driving along the river, and I talked to one 
fellow who insisted he had the proper permits," Winn said. "But I haven't had 
the time yet to check him out in our files. I hope to do that (this) week. 
</P>
<P>
"The rarest habitat you have is stream-side vegetation in a desert environment, 
like this one," said Winn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Be Beneficial 
</P>
<P>
Officials point out that, if done properly, sand mining has its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"If done properly, it can open up a flood way and prevent flooding over the 
river banks," noted Vic Smothers, who is with the Fallbrook office of the U.S. 
Soil Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
The pits that are dug in the excavation process can fill with water and 
themselves become stop-off resting areas for migratory birds, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Those same pits will fill with more sand that is washed downstream in the rainy 
season, giving the operator more material to be scooped up and delivered to his 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
But, if too many excavation pits are grouped too close together, water can rush 
downstream after having dropped off its sand load, and the dynamics of that 
so-called "hungry water" can scour the stream bed -- and eat away at the 
footings of bridges and abutments. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a plan on where these pits are located," Smothers said. 
"The basic premise seems to be, 'We need the sand; we have an industry that 
demands it, and it's necessary in the economy of urban development.' But I'm 
not sure there's a reasonable approach to it along the river. Sand should only 
be mined at its replenishment rate -- and we don't know what that rate is." 
</P>
<P>
Salata's concern is possible damage to the habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem these (sand-mining) operations create is the destruction of 
wetland vegetation that, in some cases, is occupied by federal endangered 
species," he said. "The least Bell's vireo, for instance, occupies a habitat of 
several components, including willows that take 5 to 10 years to develop. When 
you remove that from a riverbed, obviously there's a long-term lag associated 
with replacing it, even if you replant tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he noted, altering a stream bed can change the water flow 
downstream, affecting habitats well out of view of the mining itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never assessed the cumulative affects of sand mining in a particular 
drainage, like the San Luis Rey River," Palata said. "Potentially, sand mining 
is not an incompatible activity, assuming the technology exists to recreate the 
resource values that are impacted so there is no net loss. But, at this point 
in time, that ability has yet to be demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is to ensure there's no loss of valuable wetlands, yet making 
those resources available for public use," he said. 
</P>

ALL THAT'S NEWS UNDER THE SUN;

<P>
BEACH NEWSPAPER CARVES ITS NICHE IN SAND FROM DEL MAR TO OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When newspaperman Gary Taylor makes his reporting rounds, he usually skips 
police headquarters or City Hall. He goes right to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
He knows that's where all the really good scoops are. His sources aren't cops, 
they're lifeguards. And his story subjects usually are sprawled out on beach 
blankets, not ambulance stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is editor of the Beach News, an independent weekly that over the past 
two years has carved a unique niche out of the North County life style -- 
covering the world out under the sun, along the often-crowded beach that 
stretches from Del Mar to Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Published out of a converted Encinitas garage two blocks from the sand, the 
paper's small staff scouts the coast for news as though it were some small town 
with a secret to hide. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 32, has lived near the beach all his life and knows the local beaches 
and their tanned cast of characters. 
</P>
<P>
He is a former president of Swami's Surf Club, an institution along the North 
County shores. 
</P>
<P>
People talk to him and call him at home, like the lifeguard who tipped him off 
to the business at Moonlight Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The county, it seems, was about to relinquish control of the sandy plot at the 
foot of Encinitas Boulevard, one of the most popular sun-bathing spots in North 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas city officials, who apparently are eyeing the area for development, 
stressed that the same number of lifeguards would patrol the area under their 
supervision. The lifeguard believed otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's edition, the Beach News ran a cover story on the potential beach 
staffing cuts -- with quotes from both sides. It was an example of the 
aggressive reporting, the editors say, that the paper's readers have come to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
"The story about the transition at Moonlight Beach is a big topic for North 
County people who enjoy the sun," Taylor said. "It's a concern they'll read 
about in the Beach News -- and possibly nowhere else." 
</P>
<P>
In recent issues, the Beach News has run cover stories on offshore oil drilling 
and beach erosion, along with coverage of beach crime and weekly people 
features. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other suburban publications that confine their interests to city limits 
or areas such as music or entertainment, the Beach News tries to cover it all. 
If it happens on the beach -- anywhere along the 21-mile stretch from Del Mar 
to Oceanside -- it's news. 
</P>
<P>
And the editors are just as aggressive in trying to put the free paper in 
people's hands as they are in trying to put it together. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, 11,000 copies of the Beach News are distributed at more than 500 
drop spots throughout the North County -- not just in the major grocery store 
chains but in the beauty parlors and service station waiting rooms along the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Within its pages are editorials, news service stories, film and entertainment 
reviews, along with several pages of free classified ads -- featuring 
everything from overtures from lonely hearts to details on summer house 
rentals. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, says publisher James Kydd, is also the only North County non-daily 
to feature a full half-page of comics. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his reporting and editing duties, Taylor does a weekly surfing 
column called "the surfwriter" in which he takes a lighter look at the coastal 
life style -- including one tongue-in-cheek essay that recently ran with the 
headline: "When bad wives happen to good surfers." 
</P>
<P>
But the Beach News is anything but a surfer's rag, its editors say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to pretend we're the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times, 
we're just not out to make waves," Taylor said. "But we feel we do a good job 
reporting the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's a drowning on the beach, some rape or murder or even a beach 
clean-up weekend, people know the paper's coverage is balanced and 
professional." 
</P>
<P>
The Beach News is possibly best known, however, for something Taylor 
embarrassingly refers to as "the girlie factor." 
</P>
<P>
Initial issues of the paper were adorned with cheesecake photos, often on the 
front page, of bikini-clad women lounging on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the word was out that the Beach News was a sexist sheet run by a bunch of 
leering editors -- Playboy without the centerfold. One advertising agency even 
asked editors to stop leaving stacks of the paper on its doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
"People on the street would say, 'That's the paper that runs all the girlie 
pictures,' " Taylor said. "They thought the Beach News was OK, but it was a 
little sexist, that there were too many shots of girls in bikinis." 
</P>
<P>
Former Beach News editor Donna Abate recalls feeling uncomfortable about the 
pictures when she came to the paper last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure the pictures were all that tasteful," she said. "I told them 
that it looked like the photographer was out looking for a date." 
</P>
<P>
So Abate, now editor of Inn Room Magazine in Escondido, began taking her own 
photographs as a way to tone down the paper's image. 
</P>
<P>
"No way was I going to take shots of cutesy people," she said. "I wanted to 
show the rest of the beach activity, the surfers, the old couples, the kids 
doing their thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And the Bikinis Remain 
</P>
<P>
While the paper has run fewer swimsuit photos since he took over as editor in 
March, Taylor said, they remain part of the paper's attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"The photographs we run reflect what goes on at the beach," he said. "You go to 
the beach today and that's the way it is, guys and girls running around without 
a lot of clothes on. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the Beach News, and that's part of the entertainment we provide. So, 
from time to time, you're going to see pictures of girls in bikinis." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, editors and former staffers say, beach people are reading 
the Beach News. 
</P>
<P>
"People definitely read the paper," Abate said. "I'd be down at the beach 
taking pictures and see someone at every other blanket reading the Beach News. 
It was neat." 
</P>
<P>
A recent readership survey found that not just beach-goers picked up the paper, 
but often homeowners who live near the water. The paper's pages are filled with 
ads not just from sub shops and saloons but banks and realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Kydd, who has worked in the business offices of several North 
County dailies, started his paper on a shoestring in 1987 after spotting a 
market for a paper aimed at the beach community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garage Now a Newsroom 
</P>
<P>
Advances in affordable desk-top publishing convinced him to chance a weekly 
paper, he said. So Kydd bought a computer, rented a house in Encinitas and 
refurbished its two-car garage into a bona fide newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
With its desks shoved together like carnival bumper cars, it's no place Lou 
Grant would call home. But the place has character, staff members say. It has 
even developed a certain mythology along North County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who reads the paper says they know where the garage is, or they have 
a friend who knows where it is," said former Beach News editor Tom Fengler, now 
a carpenter working in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"Reports are it's anywhere from Del Mar to Oceanside. It's like all the guesses 
about the location of the studio where Wolfman Jack used to do his radio show 
back in the 60s. It's a real mystery." 
</P>
<P>
But the real mystery, staffers acknowledge, is how the paper has survived in a 
competitive North County market that is home to dozens of newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Issue in 1987 
</P>
<P>
Since the first issue of the Beach News hit the stands in September of 1987, 
several weeklies have come and gone. But the paper is still printing, Fengler 
said, because of the accuracy with which it has zeroed in on its market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's locally owned and it's close to the beach, but it's also close to the 
hearts and minds of the beach community. People say, 'It's our little paper.' 
It fills a niche in the coverage of the big dailies." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is not yet making much of a profit, Kydd said he would like to see 
the tiny independent weekly extend its coverage all the way to the Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
And that suits the staff just fine. Most say putting out the Beach News is like 
working within the family -- or taking a room at the Hotel California. 
</P>
<P>
When they can break away from the crowded newsroom, staffers are free to wander 
around the house, cook lunches in the nearby kitchen, take a nap, even do their 
laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, when Kydd's 10-year-old son, Christopher, comes home from school, 
Taylor might offer him a few surfing pointers or challenge him to a game of 
horseshoes in the side yard. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, when editors are working late laying out the paper, Chris 
will often ride his bike down to a local take-out place for burgers and fries 
for the entire staff -- and might even get a tip for his services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Image 
</P>
<P>
At first, Donna Abate took the paper's family image literally. When she was 
interviewed for her job in the living room by Liz Swain, the paper's outgoing 
woman editor, Abate thought Swain and Kydd were husband and wife. Everybody got 
a laugh out of that one. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked when I first saw that the paper was published out of the 
garage," Abate said. "But it was like being part of a little family, putting 
out a product. And I always got off on the fact that, when I went to work, I 
went to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, though, is perhaps the paper's most blatant example of a beach 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the surfer-writer look. Often unshaven, his uniform can be a shirt 
and tie or cut-off blue jeans and flip-flops. The casual attire, he says, puts 
people at ease when he interviews them. 
</P>
<P>
"Most often, they know what's coming when they see me," he said. "But I usually 
start things off with 'As you can see, I'm a reporter from the Beach News.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Horseshoe Contest 
</P>
<P>
He usually writes his stories at home and often conducts interviews on lawn 
chairs in Kydd's side yard. On Friday afternoons, he and Kydd convene the 
paper's editorial staff for a horseshoe pitching contest and a few bottles of 
beer while they think up story ideas. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursdays, when the paper is finally put to bed, Taylor hits the beach for a 
little surfing. And, of course, some more reporting. 
</P>
<P>
"When you report on the beach, you get to spend a lot of time there," he said. 
"I get to go out and go surfing and say I'm doing research. It's a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"But you never know, maybe I'll see someone drowning. And then we'll have the 
story."

LINDBERGH HORRORS

<TEXT>
<P>
The brains have fallen out of Mr. Roberts' head. They must have landed next to 
Mr. Filner's on the floor of a Boeing 747 on a collision course with the Laurel 
Travel Center. 
</P>
<P>
Their developer-buddy's multiairport proposal calling for four airports to be 
maxed-out to capacity to handle our forecast air traffic needs (Lindbergh, 
Brown, Palomar and Montgomery) is ludicrous. This is not a solution. It's

CONGRESSMAN LISTENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just returned from a brief business trip to Washington, D.C., and took the 
opportunity to "drop in" on several congressmen. I think your readers would be 
pleased to know that, at least in one instance, it appears the taxpayers are 
finally getting their money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
This particular congressman didn't have the luxurious, expensive furnishings 
like many others. His staff was hard at work, not talking to potential Friday 
night dates on the telephone, as I saw in another office. There were mounds of 
paper work on his desk and on those of his staff, too. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, this congressman took the time to do more than simply shake 
hands and quickly retreat to his office. He took time out from his obviously 
busy schedule to listen -- yes, listen -- to my concerns. And in his dignified 
but not stuffy manner, he expressed genuine interest. 
</P>
<P>
Who is this extraordinary congressman? Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad). And, in 
case you're wondering, no, I'm not a registered Republican. No one asked nor 
paid me to write this letter. I'm not even in Congressman Packard's district. I 
just wish I was.

STIRLING STIRS ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Larry Stirling's antagonism toward Walter Zelman, state director of 
Common Cause, is really not warranted. In the past decade, Dr. Zelman has 
emerged as something of a treasure for the people of California. His 
intelligence and drive, ability to communicate and fidelity to fair and honest 
politics are a matter of public record. I think we all would be quite lucky if 
Walter Zelman held a statewide public office. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Stirling's intemperate remarks were, in the end, a poor reflection on 
himself alone, and only for that perhaps worth remembering.

PLAN! SEEKS UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Tom Gorman's story on school shortages ("Students, Students 
Everywhere and Nary a Place to Sit," Sept. 5): Amen, amen and amen again -- 
there are not enough schools available for all the new homes being built in San 
Diego. Builders march merrily over hill and dale, constructing houses 
cheek-by-jowl, selling them for astronomical sums, and leaving behind shortages 
not only of schools, but of libraries, parks and other public amenities, not to 
mention increases in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Prevent Los Angelization Now!, a group (formerly known as Citizens for 
Limited Growth) which is sponsoring an initiative to ensure that new 
development pays for itself. PLAN! stands for more than merely growth 
management. One of our aims is to a focus the efforts of many disparate groups 
who see the deterioration of their neighborhoods, the raping of the 
environment, and the lack of concern for current residents when growth impinges 
upon their quality of life. Unpaid-for development costs current residents not 
only peace and contentment, but money. 
</P>
<P>
However, any such ordinance requires understanding by all San Diegans. It needs 
to be discussed, argued, modified and accepted by a majority if it is to 
achieve its goals. PLAN! wishes to join with other community organizations in a 
grass-roots effort to solve these problems and others. Our phone number is 
299-PLAN.

REFLECTIONS: 'IT'S AMAZING WHAT LITTLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION 
ON THESE KIDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

It's something akin to love that makes Monroe (Bookie) Clark spend most of his 
time and energy volunteering at his alma mater, Hoover High School. While he 
could be quietly enjoying his retirement from the insurance business, the 
64-year-old Talmadge resident is instead "getting pumped up," calling out the 
scores at the school's basketball games, or helping a foreign student learn to 
read, or ferrying a teen-ager to and from a summer job. Clark, who graduated 
from Hoover in 1943, insists he's just doing what anyone could do if they had 
the time. He says it's astonishing what a difference volunteering a couple of 
hours a week can make. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed Clark, and 
Bob Grieser photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I was born and raised here in San Diego. When I was 9 years old, my folks built 
a home out in Talmadge, and I've lived there ever since. In fact, I don't think 
there's anybody who's lived in their house continuously like I have since 1936. 
</P>
<P>
I had polio as a kid. I walked better then than I do now. I went to Woodrow 
Wilson Junior High, and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. They usually 
wouldn't let handicapped kids go to public school. In those days, they didn't 
have any facilities. Someone on crutches, well, you never saw anybody on 
crutches. 
</P>
<P>
If you were handicapped in those days, in the '30s, they had a school called 
the Sunshine School you went to. 
</P>
<P>
My first exposure to regular school was at Sacred Heart Grammar School. I went 
there in sixth grade. Then the next year, the principal at Woodrow Wilson said, 
"Hey, we'll take Monroe in." My folks had to sign a waiver in case I got hurt. 
I was the only crippled kid in the school. 
</P>
<P>
And then I went to Hoover. That really expanded my getting around and doing 
things. In those days, in 1940, Hoover was one of only two highs schools. 
Hoover was the focal point of everything out there in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The war was on. Everybody had this great feeling for their country, their 
school, everything. When I went to Hoover, there were only two black kids, and 
one Japanese boy, and I can't remember any Mexicans. We had a lot of loyalty; 
there was no race prejudice there. 
</P>
<P>
I've only really been volunteering probably less than a year, but through the 
Kiwanis Club I've been involved in Hoover since 1953. The Kiwanis sponsor the 
Key Club at school, and we sold things at the football games. Now, I announce 
the basketball games, and I love it! It's fun being around the kids. 
</P>
<P>
I started thinking, "What can an individual do?" A teacher at Hoover said to 
me, 'Well, Bookie, you ought to come over here and get involved in our computer 
lab.' When I went in there, there was this little girl sitting there, reading 
with the help of a teacher's aide. I said, 'How could a clown like me help a 
young girl like that to read?' 
</P>
<P>
The teacher said, 'Just give me two hours.' I like a challenge. I said, 'You're 
on.' Now, a couple hours a week isn't enough for me. I go in, and by the end of 
the day, I am so pumped up. It's exciting that a fourth-grade Vietnamese girl 
wants to read to me. 
</P>
<P>
I see a great need for the community to get involved and do things. Why don't 
people who are sitting around volunteer a couple of hours a week at a school? 
Anybody could help. If a person would get involved, it's extremely interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The thing I'm interested in is getting other Hoover people to do little things. 
It's amazing what little things you can do to make an impression on these kids. 
</P>
<P>
I have a ton of friends who are getting ready to retire and are bored with 
life. I'm so doggone busy. . . . I consider myself the luckiest guy in the 
whole world. I can't walk nearly as good as I walked five years ago, and I feel 
like I'm doing 10 times as much as I did five years ago.

HYPERION OFFICIALS SAY BIG-TANK PLAN IS NOT SET; 
</P>
<P>
TREATMENT PLANT TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES IN WAKE OF UPROAR OVER PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hyperion Treatment Plant officials, reacting to angry El Segundo residents, 
emphasized last week that no final decision has been reached on whether to 
build a row of giant processing tanks that would block homeowner views. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not even close to saying this is what we are going to do," Walt Naydo, 
division engineer for Hyperion, said in response to the proposal to erect a 
number of 105-foot-high processing tanks as part of the ongoing work to 
increase the plant's capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Naydo added that Hyperion, which is operated by the city of Los Angeles, would 
embark on a worldwide search to determine if there are other types of tanks 
that could be used. 
</P>
<P>
Naydo's remarks came in reaction to the uproar that followed a balloon 
demonstration conducted by Hyperion officials Sept. 23. Fifty large weather 
balloons were floated about 100 feet into the air to demonstrate to homeowners 
who live on the bluffs above the plant how their views might be affected. 
</P>
<P>
A number of residents immediately -- and vociferously -- complained to El 
Segundo and Hyperion officials that the tanks would block their beach and ocean 
views, and drive down property values. They also contended that the tanks would 
block ocean breezes that dissipate the bad odors that sometimes emanate from 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I can live with the plant the way it is now," said Elisa Bonilla, who moved to 
a home on Dune Street above the plant two years ago with her husband and three 
children. " . . . Now all of a sudden we have a 100-foot wall that is going to 
be built in front of us. That is not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Said El Segundo City Councilman Scot Dannen: "This is not just a strike against 
El Segundo. This is a strike against the entire Santa Monica Bay" because the 
tanks would be visible all along the beach and from the water. 
</P>
<P>
Dannen spent much of last week organizing a community forum on the issue. About 
200 residents attended a Thursday night meeting at Recreation Park, demanding 
that plans for the tanks be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern for Blocked Views 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Dannen said that he is convinced that Hyperion officials are sincere 
about trying to find alternatives to the tanks. However, he said he is 
unwilling to live with any tank that would block any homeowner's view. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can make it so we don't see them at all, that is fine," Dannen said. 
"But we will not tolerate any interference with our views." 
</P>
<P>
Dannen said he and residents will launch an aggressive, grass-roots campaign in 
an effort to garner political support. The final decision, which could come 
within three months, rests with Los Angeles City Engineer Robert Horii and the 
city's director of the Bureau of Sanitation, Delwin Biagi. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion officials said the proposed tanks, called digesters, would be 
egg-shaped and about 85 feet in diameter. If approved by the Environmental 
Protection Agency, a dozen tanks would be erected, probably by 1993, and nine 
others could be built in future years. Construction of the first batch would 
probably begin in mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Efficient System 
</P>
<P>
Naydo said the proposed 105-foot-high tanks are more efficient and easier to 
maintain than the 18 digesters now in operation at the plant. In addition, the 
proposed tanks would take up less space than the current type, he said, thereby 
allowing the plant to build more digesters to treat more sewage. The digesters 
currently in use are 25 feet high and 110 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
In an area equivalent in size to where four digesters now stand, nine of the 
tall digesters could be built and the volume of sewage treated could be 
doubled, Naydo said. Each of the proposed tanks would hold about 2.5 million 
gallons of solid sewage. 
</P>
<P>
Naydo said the height of the proposed tanks, which are commonly used in Europe, 
could easily be reduced by five feet, and perhaps more, simply by making the 
diameter of the tanks wider. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Naydo said, the tanks could be lowered all the way into the ground, 
although such a move would be "very, very expensive." Plans call for the tanks 
to be lowered 30 feet into the ground, but not further because they would 
encounter ground water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Profile Costs More 
</P>
<P>
"You can go as deep as necessary in order to completely eliminate the visual 
impact," Naydo said, adding that the estimated $70-million price tag for 
building 18 tall digesters would probably double if they were buried. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the tanks is unrelated to the federal court order requiring 
Hyperion to become a full secondary treatment plant by 1998, said Naydo. 
</P>
<P>
Naydo said the balloon test was conducted at the suggestion of El Segundo Mayor 
Carl Jacobson. Before to the test, few residents bothered to show up at 
workshops or a public hearing held by Hyperion to discuss the plan for the 
proposed tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically . . . we needed information from the residents to determine how 
seriously the impact may be and we needed something to work from," Naydo said. 
"From our perspective, this is only the beginning of the decision-making 
process."

MAIN DDT PRODUCTION SITE ADDED TO U.S. CLEANUP LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former Montrose Chemical Corp. site in Harbor Gateway, once the nation's 
primary source of the pesticide DDT, has been placed on the Environmental 
Protection Agency's Superfund cleanup list. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-acre site, where production was shut down in 1982, is the source of 
extensive DDT contamination in the immediate area, in shallow ground-water 
tables, in local sewers and -- at one time -- in Santa Monica and San Pedro 
bays. 
</P>
<P>
Montrose was first proposed for inclusion on the Superfund list in October, 
1984, and has been treated as if it actually were on the list ever since, said 
Nathan Lau, chief of the agency's regional Enforcement Response Section. 
</P>
<P>
Final placement on the list, which includes more than 900 sites nationwide, 
means only that Montrose is eligible for a portion of the $8.5-billion 
Superfund trust fund, if the company fails to clean up the site itself. 
</P>
<P>
But Lau said he doubts that will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between Montrose and the EPA has improved substantially" 
since the site first was proposed for the Superfund list, Lau said. "They have 
signed a consent order to do the work themselves under our supervision." 
</P>
<P>
Montrose has submitted a rough draft of proposed cleanup measures it would like 
to test at the site, Lau said. Preliminary testing of those measures could 
begin by January, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Lau expects a final cleanup program to be ready by the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Agency tests last year found the banned insecticide and another hazardous 
chemical called monochlorobenzene in the Bellflower and Gage aquifers, which 
lie underneath the former chemical plant on Normandie Avenue between Torrance 
Boulevard and 190th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Traces of DDT and other contaminants also were found in the attics of 23 nearby 
homes and businesses in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has spent between $400,000 and $500,000 studying the site over the last 
five years, Lau said. Montrose officials have spent at least as much, he said, 
but no figures were available and company representatives Friday did not return 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
DDT contained in sewage pumped from the Montrose plant, where the pesticide was 
manufactured from 1947 to 1982, has been blamed for reproductive problems that 
nearly wiped out the California brown pelican in the 1970s, and high levels of 
the chemical were found in local fish.

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN HIT-AND-RUN THAT KILLED 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
National City police, with the help of telephone tips, arrested a 22-year-old 
San Diego man Saturday night on suspicion of three hit-and-run homicides. 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Salvador Cabrera was caught after a short freeway chase south on 
Interstate 5 after he had been spotted in Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bill Osburn said that National City police had received numerous calls 
since the Thursday hit-and-run accident in which a pregnant National City woman 
and her 5-year-old daughter were struck and killed while crossing East 18th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Lidia Zamudio, 25, was about eight months pregnant when she and her 
daughter, Lili Beth Zamudio, were struck by a tan station wagon and dragged a 
short distance before the driver sped away. Attempts to save the unborn baby 
were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Cabrera and a cousin, Luis Padilla, 18, of Riverside, were spotted by four 
National special response teams as the pair pulled out of a gas station near 
Clairemont Mesa Boulevard and Balboa Avenue about 7 p.m. Saturday night, Osburn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the unmarked police cars chased and attempted to stop the car driven by 
Padilla as it headed south on Interstate 5. The arrest was made near the Front 
Street exit in downtown San Diego, after "we stuck a gun in his face" and 
forced the Cabrera car to a halt, Osburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla was released after questioning. Osburn said Padilla said he was not 
aware of the hit-and-run incident when he responded to a call from Cabrera to 
come to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside man tried to convince Cabrera to give himself up to police when 
the National City officers spotted the pair in Clairemont, Osburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, police had contacted Cabrera by telephone and arranged for him to give 
himself up. But Cabrera did not appear at the agreed-upon meeting place. 
</P>
<P>
Cabrera was booked into County Jail in downtown San Diego on suspicion of three 
counts of motor vehicle homicide, one count of felony hit-and-run and driving 
on a suspended driver's license.

IT'S TIME TO RETHINK USE OF DEADLY FORCE AGAINST THOSE FLEEING POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. ARNOLD BINDER, Dr. Arnold Binder is a professor of social ecology, 
psychiatry and human behavior at UC Irvine and co-author of The Badge and the 
Bullet on fatal shootings by police. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Sept. 19, Ernest Nunez was killed by a shotgun blast while fleeing from 
police officers in Santa Ana. The shotgun pellets entered his back and the back 
of his head, as one would expect in the case of flight without confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Nunez apparently had committed a felony and continued running away from 
pursuing officers despite repeated orders to halt, satisfying (under English 
common law) the two conditions necessary to justify killings by police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Common law was the basis for Section 196 of the California Penal Code when it 
was enacted in 1872. It states: "Homicide is justifiable when committed by 
public officers . . . in arresting persons charged with felony, and who are 
fleeing from justice." The wording of that law has not changed in all the years 
since enactment, and up until 1977 it was interpreted literally to mean that an 
officer was justified in shooting any fleeing felon -- even when the felony 
consisted simply of stealing a dog, avocados or nuts of relatively modest 
value. 
</P>
<P>
But in that year, the Court of Appeal in San Francisco construed that law to 
mean that deadly force could be used by police officers only if the felony in 
question was a violent ("atrocious") one that could lead to death or serious 
injury, or there remained a serious risk to the officer or another person. That 
became, and remains, the law throughout the state since there was no contrary 
ruling by another appeals court or by the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The perspective was given nationwide force in 1985 when the U.S. Supreme Court 
declared unconstitutional all state laws that followed codified simple common 
law requirements, and adopted a standard similar to that of California. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when it appears that an officer has shot a fleeing suspect who 
apparently has not committed a life-threatening felony, one typically finds 
such explanations by the officer as "The suspect reached for something in a 
glove compartment or in his (or her) pocket," or "The hands of the suspect 
moved suspiciously about his (or her) waist." If investigators, prosecutors or 
jurors accept the explanation, there is justification, meaning no crime was 
committed by the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there is a tendency on the part of all three groups to believe the 
officer -- there is, after all, a widespread sympathy with the travails of the 
police in the non-minority population, and it is easy to imagine that the 
police officer did perceive a furtive movement or a threatening stance. 
</P>
<P>
That orientation toward sympathetic understanding is perhaps most noticeable in 
the case of investigators from offices of district attorneys (on the "roll-out" 
teams) who are, almost without exception, former police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, very few criminal charges ever are filed against officers who 
have shot citizens, and only some of those lead to convictions. Incidentally, 
while juries are unlikely to find officers criminally liable, they are likely 
to award large sums to the survivors of police shootings and the relatives of 
non-survivors. These assessments are against taxpayers rather than officers. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal action, though an intimidating threat in theory, thus is not much of a 
controlling force in actual operation. What other means of control are there? 
One begins to think of a possible need for more control in Orange County on 
considering the substantial escalation of officer-involved shootings within its 
boundaries in recent years. That escalation occurs in the context of a 1986 
study that reported a 50% decrease in killings by police officers in 50 of our 
largest cities over a 14-year period in which the weaponry of criminals became 
more and more sophisticated. Moreover, the decrease in killings by the police 
occurred along with an even larger reduction in the number of police officers 
killed -- that is, reduction in shootings by officers has not been associated 
with greater risk to officers. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown two effective modes of controlling police deadly force. Both 
are protective of the well-being of officers and the values of society. The 
first method involves a carefully developed departmental policy statement 
presenting acceptable departmental procedure, accompanied by a strict 
enforcement attitude on the part of police officials, particularly the chief. 
</P>
<P>
The second is a comprehensive training approach based on an attitude of 
protection of life -- all life -- rather than on the archaic "officer survival" 
mentality. It is worth noting that violations of departmental policy mentioned 
in the first method are dealt with by administrative sanctions rather than 
criminal charges, varying from written reprimand through suspension to 
dismissal. In California, officers generally are well-insulated from abuse of 
such administrative control by the legal and political advocacy of their strong 
associations and by the Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights Act of 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities have revised policy and procedures to control shootings by police 
only after the occurrence of riots or near-riots in their minority communities 
(where such shootings predominantly occur), or the awards of large sums in 
response to claims and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are many people, particularly among those in law enforcement, 
who do not believe in control of police deadly force beyond the limits set in 
common law. They believe that if a person commits a more serious crime and 
refuses to stop on orders from a police officer, he or she deserves to be 
killed. To them, more shootings and killings are indications that the police 
are doing a better job. 
</P>
<P>
However appropriate this sentiment may have been in the context of the society 
of 18th-Century England, or even the society of a generation ago in the United 
States, it is markedly out of step with the broad concerns for human life and 
welfare that are pervasive forces in this country today. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing and accepting those concerns alongside the costs of excessive use 
of deadly force in terms of the building resentments among minority citizens 
and the settlement of claims and suits, it seems clear that action is called 
for at this time. The escalation in shootings and killings by the police in 
Orange County may be a sign that the system is not operating in the best 
interests of society.

BOARD ACTS CALLOUSLY IN CLOSING WELFARE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a perception in the community that anyone living anywhere in the South 
County area is financially well off, lives in an expensive home and drives a 
luxury car. It is, of course, a myth. 
</P>
<P>
But the county supervisors, who can reasonably be expected to know better, 
sometimes act as if they actually believe that there are no poor people living 
in the rapidly growing southern area. Maybe it's that they just don't care. 
</P>
<P>
If they do care, why would they take such a callous approach to the plight of 
the poor as to close the only county welfare office in South County? The office 
serves hundreds of poor people each month. And the closure comes at a time when 
the county has been generally moving in the other direction to provide police, 
fire and other decentralized services to residents far away from the county 
seat in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
With the office closed, single mothers and senior citizens, residents who need 
the nearby service the most, will be the ones hardest hit. Many of them have no 
autos. To get the service that was available close to them until Friday, they 
now must ride the bus to Costa Mesa, a journey that requires three transfers 
and takes about five hours for a round trip. That is a tiring journey for 
anyone. For a single mother with four children in tow, or a senior citizen in 
poor health, it is a major undertaking that a more sensitive and caring county 
board would not subject them to. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors say they want to save money, supposedly only for a few months 
while a full-service welfare office in Laguna Hills is being planned. But for 
now, there is not even a guarantee that the services being discontinued in 
South County will be available at the new office. No money has been allocated 
for the staff needed. A $178,000 budget request for the new office was rejected 
by the supervisors in August. And there is no assurance that the money will be 
provided in January when the supervisors are scheduled to review supplemental 
budget requests. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who represents the area and has been a supporter of 
the social services provided, has vowed to lobby for money to open the new 
Laguna Hills branch office. The other supervisors should provide the funds 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
It made no sense to close the office that has been operating in San Juan 
Capistrano for the past five years if the county is serious about reopening it 
in a few months. Board policy has been not to act on supplemental budgets until 
the mid-year review. But policy is just something the board puts down on paper. 
It can, and should, change it when common sense and need dictate. 
</P>
<P>
Some local officials, social workers and administrators of several agencies 
serving the poor were understandably upset by the county decision closing the 
branch office. To them, it was an indication that the county did not recognize 
the need for the office, or the extent of the problems facing poor people in 
South County. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 South County residents used the South County welfare service each 
month. The need is there. The South County office should be too.

HEADLIGHTS IN DAYLIGHT SAVE LIVES ON SOME ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Auto headlights do more than just light up the road at night. They can be 
lifesaving in daylight too when used on high-hazard roadways. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a two-year study in which drivers along a 13-mile stretch of 
Santiago Canyon Road were urged to use headlights during daylight show a 58% 
drop in the accident rate. What makes the reduction even more dramatic is that 
the traffic volume on the roadway increased 100% during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Canyon is not the only dangerous road to benefit from the use of 
headlights during daytime hours. The program was launched on a 14-mile portion 
of Ortega Highway four years ago and, although no official statistics have been 
compiled, the California Highway Patrol credits the headlight program and radar 
enforcement for reducing accidents by an estimated 25%. Before those programs, 
the accident rate was four times the state average for two-lane rural roads. 
The other daylight program in Orange County is along Laguna Canyon Road. No 
official statistics have been compiled on results along that road. 
</P>
<P>
The headlight program cannot be used everywhere. But in high-accident areas and 
along roads with special hazards, the headlights not only make oncoming cars 
more visible but make drivers more aware of each other and the special hazards 
the road poses. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatic as the accident-reduction results are, they can be even better. Police 
say only about six out of every 10 drivers bothers to take part in the 
voluntary program. Even more needless deaths and injuries could be averted on 
the dangerous canyon roads if more motorists, and headlights, get turned on to 
the daylight program.

This is my reply to Robert J. Jensen's letter (Sept. 17): No, Mr. Jensen, it is 
not "ignorant to point out that there is no proof that homosexuals are born 
that way." But it is ignorant to ignore studies and facts that claim they, 
indeed, are born that way. And now to the politicians with "guts and moral 
backbone": If Jensen wants to side with real guts, backbone and common-sense 
politicians, I suggest Daniel E. Young, mayor of Santa Ana, and six of his 
seven council members.

ANAHEIM SCHOOL SURVEY RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must take exception with some information in a letter to the editor (Sept. 
24) written by Edwina Walsh, a teacher in the Anaheim Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
She stated that "more than half" of the Anaheim parents were dissatisfied with 
the superintendent, according to a survey conducted last year. This is an 
inaccurate interpretation of the results. 
</P>
<P>
The district conducts a survey each year of a randomly selected sample of 
parents to determine levels of satisfaction, as well as need for change. Last 
year when asked if they were satisfied with the actions and decisions of the 
Board of Trustees and the superintendent, nearly half the parents had a 
positive, not negative response. The actual percentages are as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Positive: 44%. 
</P>
<P>
Negative: 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Undecided: 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Insufficient information: 38%. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if those who disqualified themselves for lack of information were 
removed from this group and the results recalculated, the results would be even 
more positive. 
</P>
<P>
Positive: 73%. 
</P>
<P>
Negative: 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Undecided: 17%.

REP. ROHRABACHER'S STANCE ON U.S. FUNDS FOR THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree with Rohrabacher that the now-infamous Andres Serrano crucifix and the 
photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe are offensive, disgusting and obscene. I 
also agree with Rohrabacher that the whole sorry episode has convinced me the 
NEA has proven to be a less-than-perfect federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 84,000 grants to individual artists awarded by the NEA, at 
least two dozen have precipitated controversy. Imagine that, 24 controversial 
grants out of 84,000! Any organization with a track record like that, public or 
private, deserves a commendation, not criticism! 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher favors censoring NEA projects. Rohrabacher is wrong. He surely is 
more dangerous than the problem he perceives. Rohrabacher's approach is 
cynical, mean-spirited, shortsighted and thoughtless. He would endanger our 
First Amendment freedoms to pursue his own radical Libertarian agenda. I 
suggest that Rohrabacher re-examine his priorities and focus on some of the 
real obscenities facing our nation today, such as: 
</P>
<P>
* The obscene national debt. 
</P>
<P>
* The obscenity of the savings and loan disaster. 
</P>
<P>
* The obscenity of 37 million people in the richest nation having no health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
* The obscenity of 2 million to 3 million homeless Americans within our own 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
The voters of the 42nd Congressional District include many citizens who are 
patrons of the arts. As individuals, they are very sensitive to threats to our 
First Amendment freedoms. Our Constitution is our shield against overbearing 
government and those who would use the passions of the moment to damage that 
which has withstood the test of time.

ROCKS UNDER BRIDGES DISPLACE THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a result of working as a volunteer at the Friendship Shelter for the 
homeless in Laguna Beach, I have become aware that miracles do happen. 
</P>
<P>
Because residents receive temporary housing, food, job training skills, 
counseling, money management, genuine caring, many residents graduate into the 
mainstream of society to jobs, and to their own apartment or room. One recent 
graduate had been on the streets for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
They bank their job earnings to acquire first and last months' rent. The 
director, the Rev. Colin Henderson, does a masterful job of enforcing strict 
house rules, at the same time helping each resident with his needs.

<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Mesa has got The Times' goat. Four blasts on your editorial horn in just 
two months, yet the city is unrepentant. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) was a bargain struck between 
two factions of American politics. My faction has upheld its end of the 
bargain. Those residing continuously in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982, 
have enrolled in the amnesty program, or at least have been given every chance 
to do so. Employer sanctions were delayed two years so that those not eligible 
for amnesty could prepare to leave the country in an orderly way. The idea was 
to shrink the illegal and exploitable labor pool. 
</P>
<P>
That pool is larger than ever as the other faction has struggled ceaselessly to 
frustrate IRCA. Every enforcement provision has been attacked as inhumane and 
immoral. The Times doesn't like internal barriers such as those raised in Costa 
Mesa. Neither do you want the border strengthened. A four-mile drainage ditch 
across Otay Mesa would have harmed no one. Indeed it would be safer for all 
concerned than the goal-line stand the INS must make every night. But the ditch 
reminded some of your readers of the Berlin Wall. They cannot distinguish 
between in and out. 
</P>
<P>
Do you or do you not favor unlimited immigration to this country? If not, what 
kind of IRCA enforcement will you support? 
</P>
<P>
I am well aware that immigrant labor does much of the dirty, arduous, dangerous 
work of America. But there are willing hands and strong backs in every country. 
I realize now that there will be few deportations from the undocumented 
community. But I support efforts to stem the tide.

We hold no brief for City Councilman (Robert A.) Curtis of Mission Viejo, but

REP. ROHRABACHER'S STANCE ON U.S. FUNDS FOR THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In news coverage of controversial events that create a public outcry, such as 
abortion protests, gay rights or the controversy over federal funding of the 
NEA, groups who represent the so-called conservative viewpoint are invariably 
tagged as "fundamentalist Christians" by your news reporters. 
</P>
<P>
That tag is unfair. In the minds of your readers, it could represent that all 
protesters who are morally outraged are intolerant, unfair Bible thumpers 
guided by an almost fanatic belief that they are absolutely right and everyone 
else is absolutely wrong, according to the teachings of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
There are great numbers of Americans who hold conservative opinions on moral 
issues who have nothing to do with fundamentalist Christianity. I am one of 
them. I am a Christian, yes, but I am not intolerant of other people's opinions 
or their rights. Please don't lump all protesters who hold conservative 
viewpoints under one general description of "fundamentalist Christians."

ANOTHER FIGHT MAY BE BREWING FOR FOREMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be two very interested spectators -- apart from the usual riffraff 
-- at Thursday morning's news conference to offically announce the Jan. 15 bout 
between George Foreman and Gerry Cooney at the Atlantic City Convention Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Their names are Bilal and Bahar Muhammad -- no relation -- and they are 
interested to the tune of $150,000. That is the approximate amount they have 
paid, through their promotional company, Fightcorps Ltd., to Foreman as an 
advance on a two-fight deal that was supposed to begin with a Foreman-Hugo 
Maceroni (Who? More later) bout in September and culminate in a 
Foreman-Francesco Damiani fight for Damiani's World Boxing Organization 
heavyweight title in November. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, you might recall, is the former heavyweight champion turned preacher 
who returned to the ring, at age 40, in 1987 to raise money for a youth 
foundation he was starting in Houston. In the course of his comeback -- 19 
fights, 18 knockouts -- Foreman has earned an estimated $850,000. And that does 
not include the money he has pocketed in "advances" from would-be promoters who 
want to sign him to multi-fight deals, hoping to sneak into the pot of gold at 
the end of the rainbow -- Foreman-Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Foreman's scores have been small, along the lines of the $10,000 he 
accepted from Florida promoter Ernie Letiziano for a deal that fell through. 
The Muhammad &amp; Muhammad deal, if it comes down the way it appears to be 
heading, will be the biggest contribution yet in Rev. George's collection 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't make a big deal out of this thing," a Foreman associate said. "There's 
nothing wrong with it. It's just a good business tactic." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever. Muhammad &amp; Muhammad say they have a signed contract for Foreman 
to fight Maceroni, an Argentine heavyweight of no repute and unverifiable 
record, on Oct. 27 in the Bahamas. Bob Arum, the promoter of Cooney-Foreman, 
says no way. According to Arum, the fighters' contracts specifically prohibit 
Cooney and Foreman from fighting before they fight each other in January. So 
what happens to the Foreman M&amp;M deal? 
</P>
<P>
"Foreman has assured them he will honor their contract after he fights Cooney," 
Arum said. And should Cooney win? "Then George says he will return their money. 
He's a nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, but he's also a tough businessman. Bilal Muhammad concurred with 
Arum's scenario. "We don't have any problem with George," Bilal said. "We know 
he's a man of his word. We're not worried about the money. If he wants to fight 
Cooney first, fine. We're willing to do whatever George tells us to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bahar Muhammad, however, took a tougher stance. "We're going to go in October, 
period," he said. "Wait until after he fights Cooney? Does that sound logical 
to you? What if he loses? Yeah, George will give the money back. Sure." 
</P>
<P>
So what is their recourse if Rev. George decides -- as he certainly will -- to 
fight Cooney without taking on Maceroni and-or Damiani first? A lawsuit, right? 
Neither Muhammad would go that far, but Bahar said, "We're going to do the 
logical thing. After all, we're businessmen." 
</P>
<P>
So is Rev. George. 
</P>
<P>
Who is Hugo Maceroni, anyway? Well, it just so happens that Maceroni trains in 
Arum's new Las Vegas gym. Here's the self-styled "Borscht Belt Promoter's" 
eyewitness report: "He's terrible. He's a little guy, about 5-10. He's so bad, 
he won't even spar with anyone. He just futzes around in the gym." 
</P>
<P>
There are comeback rumblings all over the boxing landscape these days. 
Cooney-Foreman, while it may be a joke and a farce and any other term you can 
come up with to mean objectionable, figures to stir up a lot more interest than 
just about any Tyson title defense with the exception of a fight with Evander 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the fighters who might opt to cash in on that interest is Larry 
Holmes, who was knocked out in four rounds by Tyson in January 1988 and turns 
40 on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Talk has been going around that Holmes would sign to fight 37-year-old Larry 
Alexander in Jacksonville, Fla., for something like $50,000. Where, you may 
ask, would such a bout lead Grandpa Larry? You guessed it -- to the winner of 
Cooney-Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I'll be 40, I still feel I'm the best out there if I have enough 
time to prepare myself," Holmes said. "People call me every day with offers. 
It's not the money. I'd only fight if it led to something big, like the winner 
of Cooney-Foreman or Evander Holyfield or another fight with Spinks." 
</P>
<P>
According to Holmes, he did sign a letter of intent two months ago with Harold 
Smith to fight a rematch with Spinks for $3 million. But, Holmes said he hadn't 
heard from Wells Fargo's favorite embezzler since. Butch Lewis, Spinks' 
promoter, denied any such offer was presented to him or that Spinks was 
considering a comeback. "I didn't even deal with Harold when he was carrying 
millions around in suitcases," Lewis said. "Why should I deal with him now?" 
</P>
<P>
Still, rumor has it that Spinks will return to boxing after having surgery on 
his knees, which troubled him throughout his career. In the meantime, Holmes 
was offered a Nov. 10 fight with Alexander by promoter Phil Myers, a longtime 
friend. Holmes wouldn't confirm or deny he was considering the offer, but he 
did agree that the urge to fight again was strong. "I'd even fight Tyson 
again," he said. "Last time I only had three months to train and no tuneups. 
I'd do it right this time. Mike Tyson didn't get the best of Larry Holmes that 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Sugar Ray Leonard, who lately changes trainers as often as some 
people change socks, had this to say about firing longtime trainer Dave Jacobs: 
"It was painful to sever the ties with Jake. He was like family." 
</P>
<P>
To this, Unswerving Irving Rudd, who turns 72 on Oct. 13, replied: "What would 
he do if he didn't like the guy? Make him walk the plank?"

'NEW' GERRY COONEY EAGER TO FACE FOREMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerry Cooney looks and sounds like a new man. But the pattern is suspiciously 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Cooney is saying he is newly dedicated. Once again, Cooney is 
saying he is finally healthy. But once again, Cooney is fighting an old man, 
and, it appears, trying to take a shortcut to the heavyweight championship of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney, who retired following a fifth-round knockout loss to Michael Spinks on 
June 15, 1987, officially announced his fourth comeback in the past seven years 
Thursday. "This is a dream thing for me," he said. "I'm finally in control of 
my life and my career. I feel better about everything now." 
</P>
<P>
Now a 33-year-old with gray streaks in his brown hair, Cooney, free of his 
managers -- Dennis Rappaport and Mike Jones -- and trainer Victor Valle, will 
fight 42-year-old George Foreman in a scheduled 10-round bout on Jan. 15 at the 
Atlantic City Convention Hall, hosted by Caesars Hotel and Casino. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Bob Arum, trying to hype a bout many in boxing consider a farce more 
suitable for professional wrestling, dubbed it "The Preacher vs. the Puncher." 
</P>
<P>
But one member of the always cynical boxing press, Dave Raffo of UPI, came up 
with what might be a more appropriate tagline: "The Two Geezers at Caesars." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, considering the stagnancy of the heavyweight division, Cooney-Foreman 
-- a match between a former heavyweight champion who had been retired for 
nearly 10 years, and a reluctant contender who has fought just four times since 
his 13th-round TKO loss to Larry Holmes on June 11, 1982 -- is expected to do 
socko business, both at the 15,065-seat arena and on closed-circuit and 
pay-per-view television systems. Foreman is an early 2-1 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the interest are many. Not the least of them is the appeal of 
two powerful punchers meeting in the ring with the winner likely to fight Mike 
Tyson, the fearsome world champion, in an even bigger closed-circuit fight next 
year. And, as always when Cooney fights, the suspicion arises that at least 
some of the appeal is Cooney's white skin. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman tried to make light of the racial issue Thursday -- "That I'm white and 
Cooney's black has nothing to do with it," he said -- but in 20th century 
America, race still sells boxing matches. Cooney and Foreman are guaranteed $1 
million each, and percentages of TV revenues could double the payday. The 
winner is expected to get a fight with Tyson -- without having beaten a fighter 
ranked in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Cooney, who looked fit at what he said was 228 pounds, tried to 
explain why this time would be different. "I'm finally at peace with all the 
things in my turbulent life," Cooney said. "I can't change the past, but all 
that happened to me is over and done with. I've made a lot of changes that 
needed to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Among them was giving up drugs and alcohol, which Cooney said became a problem 
during his periods of inactivity. For the past six months, Cooney said, he has 
been considering a comeback against Foreman, fueled by street talk and offers 
from various promoters. "Now that I've finally gotten away from all the nasty 
things and people who were around me, I'm ready to do it," he said. "I'm around 
some really healthy, nice people now." 
</P>
<P>
Cooney (28-2, 25 KOs) replaced the discharged Valle with Gil Clancy, the former 
manager-trainer of five-time world champ Emile Griffith. Clancy was highly 
critical of Cooney's performance against Spinks ("He was awful," Clancy said at 
the time), but is also parroting the "New Cooney" line. "My first job is to 
inform the press and public that Gerry no longer wants to be called Gentleman 
Gerry," Clancy said. "He's not a gentleman and he won't be when he climbs into 
the ring. Did I do it right, Gerry?" 
</P>
<P>
Clancy trained Foreman (64-2, 60 KOs) for several fights, including the final 
bout of his first career, a 12-round loss to Jimmy Young on March 17, 1977, 
after which Foreman retired to become a minister. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman has fought 19 patsies in his comeback, stopping 18 of them. "If I knew 
about Gil Clancy training Cooney, I might not have signed for the fight," 
Foreman said, struggling to keep a straight face. "He knows more about me than 
anybody in boxing."

EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL TANTON, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the breakfast counter in Waverly, almost within view of Memorial Stadium, 
there was only one topic being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to sweep," said the guy in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"No way," said the man wearing the flowered tie. "Did you see where Toronto got 
five runs in the ninth inning of their last game? They were telling us 
something." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to sweep 'em," said the guy in the white sweater, "but we'll 
win. That's just the kind of year this has been." 
</P>
<P>
"How we going to beat Toronto three out of four?" asked flowered tie. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you talking about, three out of four?" said white sweater. "All we 
got to do is win two out of three to tie." 
</P>
<P>
"What about the playoff game here Monday?" flowered tie said. "If we lose that, 
the weekend means nothing. We've got to win three out of four against a team 
with better talent -- and two of those in their ballpark. If we lose this first 
one tonight (Friday), we've got to win three straight. No way that's going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Conversations like that are taking place all over Baltimore as the Orioles open 
a three-game showdown series against the Blue Jays in Toronto Friday night. 
Little else seems to have the attention of the masses. 
</P>
<P>
All spring and summer, people have watched this phenomenon, wondering how long 
it would last. 
</P>
<P>
Can a team that lost 107 games last year actually stay in the race this year? 
All the way? 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles have done that now. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the advent of the league championship series 20 years ago, Baltimore 
can still win the pennant. If the old system were still in place, with all 
American League clubs lumped together and the champion going on to the World 
Series, there would be no excitement in Baltimore now. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, with their 86-73 record and their .541 percentage, would be in 
fifth place. Oakland, Kansas City, California and Toronto all have better 
records. The Athletics would be representing the American League in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
The lords of sports are often criticized for overextending seasons, for 
creating phony playoffs and wild-card teams, all, of course, to make more money 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Now, even with the other three division champions already crowned (Oakland A's, 
Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants), pennant fever grips five cities. 
</P>
<P>
In Baltimore, the tension is becoming unbearable. To put people's minds at 
ease, a peek at the outcome is hereby offered. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night -- Jeff Ballard wins No. 19, beating Todd Stottlemyre. The O's and 
Jays are tied for first. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday -- Jimmy Key beats Pete Harnisch. Blue Jays back on top by a game. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday -- Bob Milacki beats Dave Stieb. Regular season ends with clubs 
deadlocked with 87-74 records. 
</P>
<P>
Monday -- Ballard, with only two days' rest, starts playoff game in Baltimore. 
He runs out of gas early, is relieved by Dave Johnson. A slugfest ensues. With 
a driving rain pelting the Memorial Stadium crowd of 50,000, Keith Moreland 
hits a two-run pinch homer to win the game, 10-8. The Orioles scurry to catch a 
bus to the airport for their flight to Oakland for Tuesday's opening game of 
the American League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
You don't believe Moreland will emerge the hero? 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry. In a year like this, the year of the unlikely, Moreland is the 
most likely hero. Bet you the homer is controversial, too -- foul or fair? -- 
and the call goes the Orioles' way, adding to the aura of inevitability. 
</P>
<P>
Among many fans, there is still, after 159 games, a feeling of disbelief. Some 
are saying they hope the O's don't go down feebly. It is as if a bunch of kids 
has been sent to Toronto to do a man's job, and no one wants to see the 
youngsters hurt or embarrassed.

GOING, GOING, GONE;

<P>
IT'S THE END OF ERA FOR RICE AND STANLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GREENBERG, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In sports, as in most of life, endings are rarely as nice as beginnings. Once, 
the strapping young pitcher and menacing young hitter couldn't wait to get out 
on the field and show their stuff. Now, they sit in shadows of self-doubt as 
others are called forth. Once, they were main cogs, well-oiled from frequent 
use. Now, they are rusty spare parts, relics of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
So it is that Bob Stanley and Jim Rice depart the Boston Red Sox's scene, their 
huge 1989 salaries ($1.1 million for Stanley; $2.5 million for Rice) further 
mocking their cameo roles as the final curtain falls. Stanley is retiring after 
13 seasons. Rice, who is being let go by the Red Sox after 15 seasons, will try 
to catch on elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else they do the rest of their lives, they always will be known as Red 
Sox. It is what made them rich, famous, and yes, somewhat notorious. 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of how their abilities have ebbed that as their careers neared 
an end, Rice and Stanley made bigger news for off-the-field tiffs with their 
manager than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Last season Rice was suspended three days without pay for pulling Manager Joe 
Morgan into the dugout runway after Morgan had lifted him for a pinch hitter. 
In July, Stanley, irritated by a prolonged stretch of inactivity brought on by 
his ballooning earned-run average, publicly blasted his mild-mannered manager, 
saying he "hated" him. 
</P>
<P>
A man's ego is a terrible thing to puncture. Neither Stanley, an emotional 
overgrown teddy bear, nor the short-tempered, ever-smoldering Rice, who carried 
a proverbial chip on his shoulder bigger than any bat, took demotion lightly. 
After careers like theirs, could you blame them? 
</P>
<P>
Until this season, when his career batting average slipped to .298, Rice was 
the 15th player in history -- and the only active player -- to have both a 
lifetime .300 average and more than 300 home runs. He had 382 home runs and 
1,451 RBI and is the only player in history with three consecutive seasons of 
200 hits and 35 home runs (1977-79). He hit 20 or more homers 11 times and 
drove in more than 100 runs in eight seasons. Reggie Jackson was awed by him. 
American League slugger of the late '70s? Jim Rice was it. 
</P>
<P>
And more. He played hurt and he played hard and he played every day. And before 
his knees and eyes began to go, he played left field well. 
</P>
<P>
If it was hard to ignore Rice's facility for hitting into double plays or 
failure to hit in the clutch -- he batted cleanup in the 1986 World Series 
without driving in a run -- it was even harder to ignore his personality. 
</P>
<P>
Sportswriters don't like him. Whether he was at his peak or in the depths, it 
was always the same: There is no experience in this business more humiliating 
than trying to extract a few civil words from Jim Rice. When he isn't ticked 
off, he's on the verge of being ticked off. A writer for Sport Magazine said it 
best: "Jim Rice is the only person who can make tying his shoes a hostile act." 
</P>
<P>
Some theorize that Rice, a black from South Carolina, never got over the way 
his white rookie counterpart from Southern California, Fred Lynn, was idolized 
when they broke in in 1975. Lynn was Rookie of the Year and a star in a great 
World Series. Rice was on the bench with a cast on his broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Lynn left the Red Sox while Rice stayed the course. But if Rice was 
admired at Fenway, he was never loved. The best way to get love is to give it. 
Rice never seemed to. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley, on the other hand, was a heart-on-the-sleeve guy who fairly begged for 
love. All too often, what he got was scorn. No Sox fan will ever forget Mookie 
Wilson's at-bat with Stanley on the mound in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. 
No Red Sox fan forgets that Stanley has figured in some of the uglier moments 
in Red Sox history. It was easy to boo Stanley. But to meet him in person and 
still dislike him, that was hard. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rice, Stanley always wanted to be out there. Unlike Rice for most of his 
career, Stanley wasn't always good enough to dictate where. He was a starter, a 
closer, a mop-up man. He was 15-2 in 1978 and saved 33 games in 1983. But in 
1987, still haunted by Game 6, he was 4-15 with a 5.01 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
With a 115-97 lifetime record, Stanley will never be regarded as one of the 
greats. But with all his ups and downs -- tearing up his pitching hand taking 
out the trash, giving up Reggie Jackson's home run in the 1978 playoff against 
the Yankees -- Stanley will be remembered as one of the game's great survivors. 
He pitched in more games (637) than anyone in Red Sox history. Perhaps that is 
as it should be. After all, whose roller-coaster career better symbolizes Red 
Sox futility than Stanley's? 
</P>
<P>
Stanley and Rice also symbolize a bygone era, before free agency, before 
ballplayers switched teams as a remote control switches stations. They are two 
of only 10 men in the club's 89-year history who have played 10 or more years 
exclusively for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they are two for the road. And more sad proof that it is so much easier to 
say hello than goodbye.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL NOTES;

<P>
GAME IS FOR MORE THAN BRAGGING RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
From Morgantown, W.Va., to Pittsburgh, they call it "The Back Yard Brawl." But 
Saturday's game between the ninth-ranked West Virginia Mountaineers and the 
10th-ranked Pittsburgh Panthers has an interesting subplot. 
</P>
<P>
Each team's starting quarterback grew up in the other school's back yard. 
Heisman Trophy candidate Major Harris of West Virginia lived in the shadows of 
Pitt Stadium, and Alex Van Pelt spent most of his childhood in Mountaineers 
country before moving to San Antonio, Texas, while in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's game, scheduled for Mountaineer Field, is perhaps the most 
nationally significant meeting these regional rivals have had in a while. And 
the unbeaten starts of both teams are somewhat surprising, considering the 
preseason expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difference between this year and last year is that we expect to 
win every game now," said Harris, who lost his entire offensive line from last 
year's Sunkist Fiesta Bowl team that was beaten by Notre Dame for the national 
championship. "We have the confidence that we can come back, no matter how much 
we're down." 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia (4-0) has shown that twice this season on the road, erasing a 
10-0 halftime deficit at Maryland Sept. 9 to win, 14-10, and coming back with 
14 fourth-quarter points Saturday to win at Louisville, 30-21. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt led the Panthers to a heart-stopping, 30-23 win Saturday at home over 
Syracuse. Van Pelt, a redshirt freshman who was thrust into the starting lineup 
when Darnell Dickerson was declared ineligible academically, completed 25 of 32 
passes for 306 yards against the Orangemen. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing this victory does is that it not only opens other people's eyes, but 
it gets us to believe in ourselves," said Van Pelt, who has completed 51 of 67 
passes for 659 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt has brought the Panthers back to the national spotlight for the first 
time since 1984, the last time Pitt was in the top 10. The Panthers are 3-0 for 
the first time since 1982, Dan Marino's senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the program has a 27-26-3 record. Its last postseason appearance 
was at the 1984 Bluebonnet Bowl, which went belly-up right after the game and 
never paid off. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Wes Swinford was a walk-on freshman linebacker at Kansas whose 
only experience was playing eight-man football in his hometown of Morrison, 
Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Swinford became a starter for the Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Swinford's jersey -- No. 48 -- will be retired during halftime 
ceremonies of the Kansas-Oklahoma game. "Gee, I only wore it three weeks and 
they're going to retire it?" said Swinford. "I must be doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the only thing Swinford did right in this situation was pick the 
number worn by Gale Sayers, a former Kansas All-American. Swinford will switch 
to 58, starting against the Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, it's a privilege," said Swinford. "It will probably mean a lot more to 
me later in life because I was the last one to wear it." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Sooners (2-1), new head coach Gary Gibbs took a shot at 
predecessor Barry Switzer when asked about the personality and team unity this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have many egos," said Gibbs, who might go with redshirt freshman 
quarterback Tink Collins against the Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Berndt can't seem to get away from coaching a pitiful team of Owls. In 
his last two years at Rice, the Owls lost 18 straight games. Now at Temple, 
Berndt's new Owls have lost four straight. 
</P>
<P>
Which means a coach, not a school (Kansas State, with 16 in a row), has the 
nation's longest losing streak. "I have felt better," said Berndt, who during 
his first coaching stay in Philadelphia won four Ivy League titles in five 
years at Penn. 
</P>
<P>
Things have gone downhill since the second offensive series of Temple's season 
opener, a 31-24 defeat at Western Michigan. That's when starting quarterback 
Matt Baker went out for the season with a badly separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel we're a better team than we've shown," said Berndt, whose team 
has been outscored, 139-30, and is a 41-point underdog against the Houston 
Cougars in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th-ranked Cougars, using a run-and-shoot offense under Jack Pardee, set 
school, conference and national records in a 36-7 win last week over Arizona 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Behind junior quarterback Andre Ware, the Cougars gained 744 yards of total 
offense, including 632 passing. Houston quarterbacks set a National Collegiate 
Athletic Association record with 79 pass attempts and fell three short of the 
mark with 47 completions. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, too, that the Cougars were penalized 23 times for 236 yards, both 
just short of NCAA records. "It was pretty unbelievable," said Pardee. "Ware 
executed the offense like we drew it up on the blackboard." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ware, who broke his Southwest Conference records for completions (41) and 
yards passing (503), "I played like crap." He threw four interceptions and 
missed several open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
At least one member of the Arizona State team didn't seem impressed. Asked to 
describe Houston, safety Nathan LaDuke said, "Classless. There were a lot of 
cheap shots and talking." 
</P>
<P>
Houston linebacker Reggie Burnett, who knocked out Arizona State quarterback 
Kurt Lasher, defended his team's style of play. "We're just a real aggressive 
team defensively, and sometimes we get close calls that could go either way. 
We're not a renegade team that tries to hurt people with late hits." 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the week: "You think, 'How can anyone throw six interceptions?' Think 
about it. Six. That's a big stat. I've seen guys on TV throw five, six 
interceptions and I've thought, 'That guy is terrible.' Now I've done it 
myself." -- Missouri quarterback Kent Kiefer after his team lost, 38-7, last 
week to Miami.

PARDEE IS RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of Jack Pardee's University of Houston assistants called his boss into an 
office the other day, turned out the lights and started a film projector. "Got 
a kid I'd like to show you," the assistant said, his Cheshire cat grin hidden 
in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
The film was dark and a little grainy, as you might expect since it was more 
than 30 years old. And there, on the screen, was a scrawny return man fielding 
a kickoff for Texas A&amp;M University, eight yards deep in his own end zone, 
and boldly running forward, into the teeth of the opposition, finally getting 
slammed down a few yards short of his own 20. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Pardee had a good laugh when he saw that film, though he also recalled 
that his shoulder ached for weeks from the impact of the hit. But soon enough, 
Pardee was back to the future, plotting strategy for last Saturday's game at 
Arizona State, where the highly regarded played their second game of the young 
season, Pardee's third season as their head football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee has always preferred not to live in the past, and that has not changed 
since the days when he played six-man, high-school football in West Texas, then 
went on to star for the Aggies, the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington 
Redskins before embarking on a coaching career that has been nothing short of 
spectacular almost everywhere he went. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Pardee is back in what he considers home. His son Ted, all arms and 
legs as a 7-year-old ballboy at the Redskins training camp 10 years ago, is a 
thick-necked sophomore reserve linebacker on the Cougar team who even wears his 
dad's old No. 32. Pardee's wife Phyllis, a twirler for the TCU Horned Frogs way 
back when, has returned to her hometown. Four other grown children are 
scattered from Richmond to the West Coast. "I don't think my dad could be any 
happier," said young Teddy. 
</P>
<P>
Well, of course he could. He would prefer that his Houston football team be 
allowed to play in a bowl and appear on national television this season, but 
that's not going to happen. The Cougars are on NCAA probation for 
transgressions committed before he took the job three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee had spent the previous season working for the Green Bay Packers as a 
scout, that being the year the United States Football League folded, with 
Pardee the head coach of the Houston Gamblers. He was the man who brought the 
run-and-shoot offense to professional football, but now the runners and 
shooters were all out of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a man with Pardee's impressive credentials could not be out of work for 
very long, and when Houston President Richard S. Van Horn came to pick a coach, 
"there really was only one decision to make," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just had an impeccable record as a player and a coach," Van Horn said the 
other day from Norman, Okla., where he is now president of the University of 
Oklahoma. "But the most important thing to us was the fact that he had an 
unblemished record of integrity. He wants his players to get an education and 
to graduate. And he was committed to operating within the rules. He was a 
perfect fit." 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost. Pardee came into town and started hustling for a staff and for 
players. It was common knowledge that Houston was being investigated by the 
NCAA for transgressions that included paying money to players by longtime coach 
Bill Yeoman and his staff. Not big money, mind you, because Houston has always 
been the undernourished commuter school with mostly hand-to-mouth financial 
support. 
</P>
<P>
The oil business helped fill the coffers at Texas A&amp;M, Southern Methodist 
and Texas. But not here on this sprawling campus filled with parking lots, 
modern architecture and hundreds of moss-covered oak trees and bordered on one 
side by a freeway, on another side by railroad tracks and on another by a 
dreary slum neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the threat of NCAA sanctions kept some high-quality athletes away, 
and when the NCAA finally announced the probation last season, the 
throat-cutting by rival recruiters intensified. "During the investigation, 
they'd tell the kids, 'Don't go to Houston, you'll never play in a bowl, you'll 
never be on TV,' " Pardee said the other day. "That was the hardest part. The 
investigation was a hammer hanging over our head. It's much easier to deal with 
reality than speculation. Now at least we know what we're up against, and we 
can live with that." 
</P>
<P>
And prosper, as well, though it took a while for this unpretentious coach at 
this unpretentious school. After the Cougars opened the Pardee Era by losing 
six of its first seven games in 1987, they turned the season around by stomping 
Texas 60-40 that year and finishing 3-0-1 down the stretch. Last year the 
Cougars were 9-2 and just missed a Cotton Bowl trip (the bowl ban was for this 
season), settling for a visit to the Aloha in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
And they opened this year with a 69-0 thrashing of Nevada-Las Vegas, good 
enough to earn them the No. 1 ranking ahead of Miami and Notre Dame in USA 
Today's computer rating system based on strength of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
They are doing it with the same run-and-shoot Pardee employed so successfully 
in his stint with the Gamblers of the USFL, and a pro style 4-3 defense Pardee 
has always played and coached. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always tried to find the right way to win with the talent you have 
available," Pardee said. "In Chicago, I had Walter Payton, and you don't have 
to be a genius to know that you give it to Walter Payton. When I came to the 
Gamblers, we had a great quarterback (Jim Kelly) and a lot of little guys who 
could catch the ball (including Redskin Ricky Sanders). Everybody's always 
looking for the great athlete, the 6-3, 215-pounder like Charley Taylor. But 
there are a lot of good athletes out there if you don't put such stringent 
physical requirements on them. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came to this program, we knew that to have a chance to compete, we 
couldn't do the same things Texas and Arkansas and A&amp;M were doing. We 
couldn't jam the ball down anyone's throats with what we had. We didn't have a 
big line and a great runner. But we had a lot of kids who could fly, and now 
we're staying with it." 
</P>
<P>
The man in control of all those fabulous flyers -- four receivers and more than 
occasionally the set back go down field -- is a softspoken junior quarterback 
from Dickinson, Texas. Andre Ware is his name, and passing is definitely his 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Originally recruited by Yeoman as a veer quarterback, Ware started playing 
regularly as a freshman until he broke his arm in midseason. But after three 
years, "I feel real comfortable with it," Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Ware set conference records with 25 touchdown passes, 39 completions 
in one game and 471 yards in another. Against UNLV, he threw for five 
touchdowns in the first half, another Southwest Conference mark, and completed 
30 of 48 passes for 396 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee also is learning about the college game. His first year, his playbook 
was probably too thick and he had to remind himself that he also was coaching 
students who had to go to class. So he adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
He's simplified things, scheduled team meetings whenever he could and made sure 
he had an assistant coach live in the team dormitory and another academic 
coordinator to make sure his players were going to class. 
</P>
<P>
"He's wonderful to play for," Ware said. "He's laid back, he doesn't beat 
anything into you and he treats you like a man. It's a pleasure to play for 
him, but you always know that if he tells you something, you better believe it 
because he means it. And he really wants to win." 
</P>
<P>
Some have speculated that Pardee really wants to get back into the National 
Football League. His last experience there was a bitter one, essentially fired 
by Jack Kent Cooke in 1980 over so-called philosophical differences with 
then-Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee does not like to dwell on that situation, though now, years later, he 
will admit that he might have made a mistake leaving the Bears for the Redskins 
in the first place. But he loved Washington, had a beautiful home and some land 
outside Middleburg, Va., and thought "I could spend the rest of my life there. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only job I ever lost in my life," Pardee said. "I just went back 
there too soon. ... Looking back, I should have stayed in Chicago ... The owner 
(Cooke) didn't hire me. He wanted it structured the way he wanted it. When I 
run something, I want to run it the way I want to run it." 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation here that Pardee will not be at Houston very long. 
When Jackie Sherrill was fired at Texas A&amp;M, Pardee's name was mentioned. 
There will always be talk about him going back to the pros, and even Pardee 
admits that he wonders why, after he left in 1980, no NFL owner ever called 
with a head-coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
"You wonder what criteria people have to hire a coach when you see some of the 
guys who have been hired," he said, without naming names. "But I've never been 
a part of that fraternity. I was never being groomed or brought along. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is the good Lord has always provided for me. I've never had a set 
road. When one thing ends, another door seems to open. There's no conspiracy 
against Jack Pardee, I'm sure not that paranoid to think that people are out to 
get me." 
</P>
<P>
No, Pardee has other priorities. He's already licked cancer, once in 1964 when 
a melanoma on his arm almost killed him; again in 1986 when he needed surgery 
to remove a growth in the back of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't imagine how happy I am to be here," Pardee said. "I enjoy the 
lifestyle, my wife is home. The school has been very good to me, and I've got a 
great bunch of kids to work with. Sure there are problems, but nothing you 
can't solve. I'd like to have more depth, I'd like not to have to recruit so 
many junior-college kids. I'd like to go to a bowl and be on TV. But it will 
come." 
</P>
<P>
For Jack Pardee, it always has.

AS HIGH SCHOOL COACH, KEN HOUSTON IS A PRO WITH HIS KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD SHAPIRO, The Washington Post

HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Houston is standing in the middle of a high-school gym trying to convince a 
couple of bashful and slightly self-conscious teen-age boys that the Harlem 
Shuffle isn't quite as hard as it might look. Then he starts to demonstrate. 
Two steps to the right, kick, two steps to the left, kick. Soon the boys and 
their gym teacher are almost in step, clapping their hands and dancing to the 
music just as the bell rings mercifully to end the school day. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things just never change," Houston says later. "The boys still hate to 
dance, and the girls still hate to play basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Other things never change as well. When Houston was completing a Hall of Fame 
professional football career with the Washington Redskins in the 1970s, he 
always told anyone who asked that when he retired he wanted to go back home and 
"work with the kids." Some athletes say it because it sounds good. Then they 
drive off in the Mercedes and call their agents from the car phone. 
</P>
<P>
Not Ken Houston. 
</P>
<P>
These days the man George Allen once described as the best strong safety in the 
history of professional football still looks as if he could play the game. He 
is almost 44, lean and muscular as he walks the halls of Westbury High School 
in blue coaching shorts, a polo shirt, high white socks and sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
He teaches four physical education classes a day at the Houston school, patrols 
the corridors, coaches the varsity football team and serves as the athletic 
director. Every morning he's up at dawn to get to school for first period, and 
many days he's not home until 8 or 9 at night. There are practices to oversee, 
films to review, lifting in the weight room, skull sessions with his team and 
his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's all he ever wanted to do. He knows that now, though people keep 
asking him why he's coaching high school when he would seem to be an ideal 
candidate to be in the pros, perhaps even as a man who surely could become the 
first black head coach in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Houston does not rule out the possibility of getting back to the pros. But he 
has a bitter taste from his last experience. He spent four years as an 
assistant with the Houston Oilers, then lost his job when defensive coordinator 
Jerry Glanville replaced Hugh Campbell as coach in 1986. Houston thought sure 
his colleague would ask him to stay on to coach a secondary that he built from 
scratch with four rookies. But the phone call never came, and Houston decided 
then and there to take a different path. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time for a change on my part," Houston said. "The Oiler experience was 
a disappointment, but I'm not bitter about it. When they let the staff go they 
gave everybody plane tickets to Mobile (Ala.) for the Senior Bowl so we could 
talk with other teams about getting a job. I didn't go. I decided I did not 
want to uproot my wife again, I did not want to get on that merry-go-round." 
</P>
<P>
So he got off. He took a job at inner-city Houston Wheatley High School and 
spent three years at it, struggling to get youngsters to come out for football 
and losing every year with undersized, outmanned teams. This year he made the 
move to Westbury, a bigger school in a better neighborhood that plays at the 
highest level of Texas football. So far his team is winless, with close losses 
in its first two games and a 72-0 blowout by Houston Sterling, the state's 
seventh-ranked team, last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I don't care if you win or lose," said Shirley Johnson, the 
principal at Westbury who hired Houston. "Just having him here with us is the 
most important thing. Kenny was the first coach I interviewed. He came here 
early and that told me something. The minute he walked in the room, I knew this 
man was so kid-oriented. He couldn't say three sentences without the word 'kid' 
in there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know much about the technical football stuff, but I knew that was 
going to be there. What I didn't know was his impact on these kids. This man 
supervises the halls; he's got the most unbelievable caring attitude. He's like 
a Pied Piper. Everywhere he goes he's got a trail of kids following him. And 
our attendance at the games has picked up; all the daddies want to see him." 
</P>
<P>
His players are equally enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that we're learning from the best," said James Beasley, a 
junior who shares Houston's old position, strong safety, with classmate Robert 
Swaim. "He's always telling us we're giving him a headache or a heart attack. 
But he's always watching us, telling us what to do, where to go." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't argue with him, that's for sure," said Swaim. "He's a Hall-of-Famer. 
He's the best. How can you argue with that?" 
</P>
<P>
Added cornerback Dexter Goodson: "If you make a mistake, he doesn't jump all 
over you. He'll pull you over, show you what you did wrong and let you go back 
out and play. We work real hard, but he makes the game fun." 
</P>
<P>
In 14 years in the NFL, the last eight with the Redskins, the game always 
seemed fun to Houston. He was as gifted an athlete as ever played, voted into 
the Hall of Fame the first year he became eligible. He was one of Allen's 
trusted "generals," a team leader in every sense, a brilliant cover man who hit 
with stunning swiftness and an occasionally lethal forearm. He made arguably 
the most famous tackle in Redskins history, stopping Walt Garrison at the goal 
line in the closing seconds to preserve victory in a tense Monday night game 
against the Cowboys in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
But Houston doesn't waste much breath talking about the past, because his 
present and his future don't allow much time for reminiscing. He still sees his 
old teammates every once in a while. Diron Talbert lives in town and they cross 
paths. Alvin Reed, a college and pro teammate as a tight end at Prairie View 
and with the Oilers, and traded with him to the Redskins for five players in 
1973, is still his best friend and lives 30 minutes away, working as a 
community-relations expert with the city's Metro system. Even Jack Pardee, his 
last coach in Washington, is just a few miles down the freeway as coach of the 
University of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
It was Pardee who touched off a firestorm of criticism for not putting Ken 
Houston into his final home game of the 1980 season. Occasionally they see each 
other, and Houston said: "We've never talked about that day. At the time it was 
just very disappointing. I certainly would rather have played that day. It 
meant so much to me, and I hope it meant something to the fans of the Redskins. 
But it wasn't done maliciously, I'm sure of that. Jack doesn't have a malicious 
bone in his body. He was the coach, I was a player, and now it's over." 
</P>
<P>
And now Ken Houston is a coach, a teacher, and a role model for his kids in 
every sense of the word. He is also a father for the first time. He and Gustie, 
his wife of 22 years, have a girl, Kene, a year old. The Houstons also are 
watching over their nephew, Rubert, a ninth-grader who moved from Louisiana and 
lives with them in a comfortable suburb filled with tree-lined streets and 
young families. There is a bass boat parked in the driveway, and Houston 
rhapsodizes about the 33-acre farm -- and the well-stocked pond -- he bought 
years ago that serves as the family's weekend country escape. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL just seems so many miles away now. This past summer Houston was 
contacted by David Cornwell, the NFL's director of equal employment and an 
assistant league counsel, and asked to participate in a minority fellowship 
program that seeks to expose promising young black coaches to the pros, with 
hands-on experience at training camps around the country. The idea is to get 
them more experience and provide NFL front offices a larger talent pool for 
filling coaching vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Cornwell, a native Washingtonian who played high-school football at Sidwell 
Friends, grew up idolizing Houston the player and wanted him to get back into 
the NFL mainstream. He talked with Houston about spending the summer with the 
Los Angeles Rams, but Houston decided he couldn't take the time away from his 
high-school team. He was moving into a new job. He had to organize his players 
and pick a coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Cornwell said he was disappointed, but still believes Houston can have a future 
in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"You always hear all this talk about who is 'qualified' and I don't 
particularly like that kind of talk," Cornwell said. "But in this case, this 
man's qualifications are impeccable. I know he's highly respected among head 
coaches, assistant coaches, everyone who ever comes in contact with him. I 
can't think of anyone across the board who enjoys so much respect. His playing 
background and his coaching background would be the perfect mix for a pro job, 
from assistant to head coach." 
</P>
<P>
Houston says he appreciates everything Cornwell tried to do, and will not 
immutably close the door to returning to that level of football. But he is a 
proud man and says: "What would I learn in two months in a pro camp that I 
didn't know from 14 years of playing and four more of coaching the Oilers? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want that to sound like I'm thumbing my nose at the NFL. But after all 
that time, I think I know football. That's not a conceited statement, and I'm 
sure there are many people who know a lot more than I do. I also know there are 
steps you have to take, from assistant to coordinator to head coach. But a lot 
of head coaches they've got now seem to do it faster than that. I know I am 
qualified to do it. But right now the timing just isn't right." 
</P>
<P>
So Houston will stay at Westbury High School "for as long as they'll have me," 
he said. "This is for the kids, not for me. I don't have to be selfish, I don't 
have time to think about me."

An overpowering running game helped Miraleste High School rally in the second 
half for an 18-14 victory over Orange Lutheran in the Olympic League opener for 
both teams Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste tailback Dan Sarner rushed for 180 yards in 27 carries, 46 yards 
coming on the final scoring drive, which ended when Sarner plunged over left 
tackle from a yard out to give Miraleste the lead with 54 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran running back Gil Greene ran for 102 yards in 19 carries, but 93 
yards came in the first half, when the Lancers (2-2, 0-1 in league) opened a 
14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Greene scored on a three-yard run in the first quarter, and his 52-yard sprint 
from scrimmage in the second quarter set up Orange Lutheran's second touchdown, 
a 26-yard pass play from Lenny Gavin to Phil Matheson. 
</P>
<P>
Sarner, a sophomore, also scored on a six-yard burst in the third quarter to 
trim the Orange Lutheran lead to 14-11. Sarner's running mate, Dan Crofton, 
also a sophomore, gained 93 yards in 15 carries for Miraleste (3-1, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's the business of establishing a passing game at Sunny Hills. 
Quarterback Rick Orr threw for only 61 yards and has thrown for only 197 yards 
in four games.STUART MATTHEWS

SUNNY HILLS ROLLS OVER CANYON BEHIND POTENT RUNNING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunny Hills High School's running game continued to pile up the yardage 
Saturday night, although the Lancers had problems scoring in a 17-0 victory 
over pesky Canyon in front of 1,050 fans in Buena Park's Spaulding Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills won its fourth consecutive game by rushing for 298 yards, but the 
outcome was in doubt until the final quarter, when the Lancers scored 10 
points. Fullback Brian Pizula gained 122 yards in 22 carries and scored his 
eighth touchdown of the season with only 55 seconds remaining to put the final 
touches on a sluggish Sunny Hills performance . 
</P>
<P>
Junior Mike Sullivan, who found it difficult breaking into the lineup with the 
all-league duo of Pizula and Ken Overby returning this year, had his best game 
of the season. Sullivan, playing at Z-back, gained 112 yards in eight carries, 
including the most exciting play of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, utilizing his great speed, swept to his right and then sprinted past 
the Canyon secondary for a 74-yard touchdown run with 2:31 remaining in the 
first half to break a scoreless deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best we've seen Mike run this season," said Tim Devaney, Sunny 
Hills coach. "He picked his lanes well and ran real well inside. I thought all 
three runners complemented each other very well." 
</P>
<P>
Overby added 64 yards in 12 carries and had the defensive play of the game when 
he teamed with tackle Darren Correll to stop Canyon fullback Jeff Brunswig for 
no gain on fourth down and one at Sunny Hills' 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (1-3) outplayed Sunny Hills in the first half and showed vast 
improvement over last season, when the Comanches struggled to an 0-10 record. 
Canyon had opportunities to score twice in the first half when John Leos 
recovered a fumble and Mike Greene intercepted a pass, but each time the 
Comanches self-destructed. 
</P>
<P>
"Canyon will surprise some people," Devaney said. "It was good for us to get 
our butt kicked a little. Hopefully, practices will be better next week with 
Esperanza coming up." 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills was coming off a weeklong trip to Edmonton, Canada, where it 
pounded host La Zerte, 51-0, and Devaney feared a letdown. The Lancers appeared 
to be a half step off stride most of the first half but got on track in the 
second half, when they rushed for 175 yards.

FOR WHEELCHAIR TENNIS ATHLETES, FORMER THERAPY IS SERIOUS SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the Big Time. They came from Australia, England, the Netherlands, 
Alabama, Tennessee -- California, too -- to play in the Seventh Annual World 
Wheelchair Tennis Invitational. The prize money was the largest it has ever 
been -- $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The significance of the event is that we are showcasing the best men and women 
in the world," said David Kiley, winner of the men's doubles, with his partner 
Randy Snow, and host athlete for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Eight men and seven women competed in the tournament, which began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Championship wheelchair tennis -- as played Saturday at the South End Racquet 
and Health Club in Torrance -- now is far more than therapy for the victims of 
broken backs. 
</P>
<P>
It has become a game of flat hard serves, deceitful returns and dazzling chair 
spins. The only concession to limited mobility is a two-bounce rule. 
</P>
<P>
The guys have mitt-crushing handshakes, biceps bigger than their atrophied 
thighs, shoulders you could walk on -- and the steely-eyed stares of 
competitors as fierce as any in able-bodied sports. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out here to win," said Kiley, 35. "We aren't out to prove any point 
about courage. The game is three times as hard as playing with your feet." 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "the best all-around wheelchair athlete in the United States," Kiley is 
an unusual exemplar of the rule "once a jock, always a jock." 
</P>
<P>
He works out five days a week, several hours a day, lifting weights, getting 
aerobic conditioning. He can rip off three sets of 20 chin-ups. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the U.S. Wheelchair Basketball team that won the gold medal in the 
1988 Paralympic Games in Seoul, he led the Casa Colina Condors to six national 
championships in the last nine years and has been named Most Valuable Player 
five times by the National Wheelchair Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
He broke his back 16 years ago when an inner tube he was riding down a snowy 
hill at Big Bear struck a tree. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an athlete. That was all I did," he said. "I didn't care about anything 
but sports." A point guard for the Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, he 
became introduced to wheelchair basketball while undergoing rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Wheelchair basketball, give me a break!' But this guy broke my 
stereotypes real fast." It was the coach of a wheelchair basketball team: He 
was dropping in back shots one after another, and Kiley decided to join in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'For My Ego' 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the sport was physical and mental therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed something for my ego," Kiley said. 
</P>
<P>
But the old competitive juices started flowing. He took up tennis, skiing, got 
married, became sports director of the Pomona-based Casa Colina Centers for 
Rehabilitation, which sponsored Saturday's tournament -- and his ego no longer 
needed the boost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is in sports to excel. 
</P>
<P>
"I never would have been at the top of any able-bodied sports. I have been most 
fortunate to be at the top of wheelchair sports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But apart from the personal goal, Kiley and other wheelchair sports activists 
also make the point that many with spinal cord injuries can do a lot more than 
was dreamed possible before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Common Fallacy' 
</P>
<P>
For example, the two children he fathered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a common fallacy that disabled people cannot enjoy the finer parts of 
life," he said, with a knowing smile. "The doctors told me I couldn't have 
kids. Huh, that's what they know. You have to learn not to listen." 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the day's event, Kiley said that he hopes someday people will 
watch wheelchair tennis on national television networks for its value as pure 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that wheelchair tennis will become that attractive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
FINAL RESULTS: 
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles: David Kiley of San Dimas (ranked No. 3 in the world) and Randy 
Snow, Birmingham, Ala. (No. 1). 
</P>
<P>
Women's doubles: Monique Van Den Bosch of the Netherlands (No. 2) and Jan 
McMorran of England (No. 8).

PREACHERS FIND CONVERTS AMONG LATINOS ALIENATED FROM CATHOLICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beads of perspiration covering his face, Juan Ruelas delivers his tirade to a 
largely indifferent public of shoppers and passers-by at the San Fernando Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"Cowards, effeminates, unbelievers, liars, drunkards and idol worshipers will 
not inherit the kingdom of God!" Ruelas yells angrily in Spanish, struggling to 
be heard above the noise of passing traffic. "The kingdom of God is for the 
valiant!" 
</P>
<P>
"Brother Juan" and his handful of followers from the Body of Christ Church drew 
derisive laughter and sneers from some mall shoppers. Still, the Pacoima church 
and others in the east San Fernando Valley are having little trouble finding 
converts in the overwhelmingly Catholic Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
The evangelists' success among Latinos worries many Catholics. They say the 
Catholic Church's failure to understand changes in the Latino community may be 
to blame. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Million Converts 
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the Chicago-based National Research Center, about 
60,000 Latino Catholics shift to evangelist and other Protestant churches 
nationwide each year and nearly 1 million have converted in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something of serious concern to the church," said Bill Rivera, a 
spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. "We have no 
problems with the mainline Protestant churches. It's the small Pentecostals -- 
they are very aggressive in their recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
Although Catholic churches in the predominantly Latino communities of the East 
Valley retain large congregations, none can match the rate of growth achieved 
by some evangelical churches. 
</P>
<P>
The Praise Chapel Christian Fellowship in Sun Valley, for example, began six 
years ago with a handful of people meeting in a storefront church. Now Praise 
Chapel claims 350 members who occupy a converted warehouse. And the 
congregation recently sent ministers to Northern California to start new 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a process of multiplication," said Tyrone Garay, a 23-year-old minister 
at the Sun Valley church. "We're growing because of our evangelizing. We hit 
the streets a lot, with flyers and posters to expose people to the church." 
</P>
<P>
The preachers take their militant evangelism not only to shopping malls but 
also to parks, bars and dance halls. Sometimes the evangelists preach to the 
youths who cruise Valley streets on weekend nights. Often they openly confront 
the beliefs of the area's Catholic majority. 
</P>
<P>
On one recent Sunday, Ruelas' group distributed flyers explaining why 
Christians should not venerate the Virgin Mary, one of the most holy symbols 
for Latino Catholics. And Ruelas said his reference to "idol worshipers" in the 
street-corner sermon was aimed at Catholics who revere saints, represented by 
statues in Catholic churches and homes. 
</P>
<P>
A 35-year-old day laborer from Mexico who looks for work on street corners when 
he isn't preaching on them, Ruelas said: "The Bible tells us we shouldn't kneel 
before any statue. It's an aberration to God." 
</P>
<P>
In Pacoima, there are at least six storefront Pentecostal churches on four 
blocks of Van Nuys Boulevard. Together, the churches form a sort of "church 
row" interspersed among the boulevard's hole-in-the-wall bars, pawnshops and 
housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Members 
</P>
<P>
Evangelists say the boulevard is fertile ground for finding new converts. 
Traditionally, the churches have been successful in recruiting members from 
among the ranks of former gang members and those who suffer from alcohol and 
drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Reynoso, a 25-year-old leader in the Church of the Companionship of 
the Living Word, said he and some of the other 150 members of the Van Nuys 
Boulevard church are former gang members. 
</P>
<P>
After he was invited to the church by a carnal (Spanish for "blood brother" or 
close friend), Reynoso said church members took an active interest in his 
well-being, persuading him to step away from a life of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to my house to talk to me, to see how I was," he said in Spanish. 
"It helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Now Reynoso joins other church members who spend their evenings preaching to 
patrons of Van Nuys Boulevard bars. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they get mad," Reynoso said of the bar patrons. "But since we go in 
a big group, all together, they listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, bartenders at the Nopalito Cafe, El Paseo Dance Hall and other Van Nuys 
Boulevard establishments said the evangelists are a common sight, drifting 
among bar stools and pool tables to pass out leaflets and to exhort 
"unbelievers" to seek salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Those who attend an evangelical service may see and hear something unlike 
anything that they have experienced before. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in tongues is not uncommon at Pentecostal churches. And at most 
evangelical services, the faithful are encouraged to raise their arms and shout 
out praise to the Lord: "Gloria a Dios!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the proceedings seem surreal. Before a service Wednesday evening at 
Reynoso's church, about a dozen members of the congregation paced about the 
aisles of the small chapel, wailing eerily toward the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso explained that the men were praying. Church members pray for at least 
30 minutes before each service, he said, "to feel the power of God. We have 
discipline here. . . . It's a spiritual discipline." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fight Over Views 
</P>
<P>
The same spiritual discipline also leads members of the Praise Chapel Christian 
Fellowship in Sun Valley to take their hard-sell evangelism to the streets. 
This summer, the group made headlines when a spontaneous religious debate with 
Catholic youths cruising Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Pacoima escalated into a 
brawl. One Catholic youth and one evangelist were left with black eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me I was Satan," one 19-year-old San Fernando girl said of the 
evangelists. "They said I was lost, and they had been found." 
</P>
<P>
The girl also said the evangelists made fun of her for practicing the Catholic 
ritual of confession. "It's false advertising. They're not peaceful people," 
she said. "I was born Catholic, raised Catholic and I'm gonna die Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
Father Bill Antone, pastor at Mary Immaculate Catholic Church in Pacoima, said 
the evangelists' persistent questioning of the Catholic faith and its symbols 
has caused many of his parishioners to come to him for counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Some come after attending an evangelist service, or after talking to a friend 
who has joined an evangelist church, he said. "They ask me, 'Are we adoring 
something other than God?' Especially among the youth, it's a pretty common 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Antone said he believes that many Latinos are drawn to the evangelical 
churches' lively and emotional services. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people carry very deep anxieties with them, and an emotional way of 
letting it out is good. But I'm not sure if that's a long-range solution," he 
said. "The answers just don't fall from heaven. I just don't find the word of 
God as I walk on the sidewalk." 
</P>
<P>
A service at the Praise Chapel in Sun Valley on Thursday night was not lacking 
in emotion or entertainment. The 300 people who attended the outdoor proceeding 
in the chapel's parking lot were treated to sing-along hymns and a concert by a 
gospel pianist -- the chapel itself was recently ordered closed by the Fire 
Department for building code violations. 
</P>
<P>
There was also the lively sermon of co-Pastor Randy Bautista, who spoke to the 
audience through an amplified public-address system. "Thank you Jeeesus, and 
turn up the monitor please," Bautista said with the crisp, clear voice of a 
radio announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Garay, the 23-year-old minister, spoke to the congregation of his personal 
battle with drug abuse. "I'm an ex-cocaine dealer," he said. "I used to push 
drugs. Now I push Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
Before his sermon, Garay said that although he grew up Catholic, he believes 
that Catholicism no longer fills his spiritual needs. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church is "dead; there's no hope, no purpose," Garay said. Many of 
the members of Praise Chapel are former Catholics who feel that Catholic 
services are "real repetitive, like religious calisthenics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growth of evangelical churches such as the Praise Chapel, there is 
little sign of a weakening of the faith at churches such as Santa Rosa Catholic 
Church in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Each Sunday, the church is filled to capacity for most of the three English and 
seven Spanish-language Masses. In addition, priests perform about 60 baptisms 
each weekend. And parents still line up to enroll their children for catechism 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Strong cultural traditions, it seems, will keep many Latinos from abandoning 
the Catholic faith. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the road that we've always taken," said Jose Esparza, a warehouse worker, 
when asked why he enrolled his 6-year-old daughter, Magali, and 5-year-old son, 
Octavio, in catechism classes at Santa Rosa. "It goes back to the roots of my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ruelas and his fellow members say they will keep trying to 
convince Catholics that there is only one true interpretation of the word of 
God. 
</P>
<P>
The part-time preacher said he and other members of the Body of Christ Church 
take their marching orders from a passage in the Bible -- Mark 16:15 -- in 
which a resurrected Jesus appears before the apostles. 
</P>
<P>
The passage reads: "And he said unto them, 'Go ye into all the world, and 
preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.' "

CONSERVATIVE DAVIS GOES AGAINST IMAGE WITH PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it the greening of Ed Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for his cop quips and law-and-order image, Davis, a Republican who 
represents the state's conservative 19th Senate District, has become an 
environmental advocate. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Davis -- a lifetime National Rifle Assn. member and ex-Los 
Angeles police chief -- has startled and delighted conservationists by working 
to protect mountain lions, crack down on "outlaw developers" along the coast, 
create new parkland and slow the pace of home building in the Santa Clarita 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in 1988, he posted the best pro-environmental voting record among GOP 
state senators, according to the California League of Conservation Voters. 
Davis voted for 85% of the key bills tracked by the league, well above the 
Republican average of 68%. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to ruin my political career, but I consider myself an 
environmentalist," said Davis, laughing, during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
For some preservationists, Davis' new devotion to their cause somewhat 
jarringly contrasts with his public image as an 
ex-cop-turned-conservative-politician. And outwardly, that image is little 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
The walls of his Chatsworth offices are festooned with mementoes of his Los 
Angeles Police Department days. There is an autographed photo of the late Jack 
Webb, star of the old "Dragnet" television series; another photo bears 
greetings from the stars of the "Adam-12" TV cop show. 
</P>
<P>
But the man who once urged that skyjackers be hanged at airports now talks 
worriedly about the destruction of Amazon rain forests, reads National Wildlife 
magazine and declares that developers who violate state coastal rules ought to 
be thrown in prison. 
</P>
<P>
His position is all the more remarkable in light of his past antagonism toward 
California Coastal Commission officials, whom the colorful, sharp-tongued Davis 
referred to as "environmental fascists" and "unmitigated bastards" during his 
frequent squabbles with the agency in the early 1980s, when his district 
included Malibu (the area was reapportioned away from him in 1982). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs Coastal Agency 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, Davis, 72, has emerged as a strong supporter of 
the beleaguered coastal protection agency. 
</P>
<P>
He has voted several times to restore cuts made in the commission's budget by 
its political archenemy, Gov. George Deukmejian. Earlier this year, Davis 
introduced a bill (recently vetoed by the governor) giving the commission power 
to move faster to stop illegal coastal development. 
</P>
<P>
"He's now our champion," said Bill Allayaud, the commission's Sacramento 
lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he changed his attitude because Deukmejian's appointments to the 
commission have been good therapy for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The Coastal Commission has become a constructive force," he said. "They were 
properly sent to the woodshed when he came in; they deserved to go to the 
woodshed. My feeling is that they have reformed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical Voting Record 
</P>
<P>
Elected to the Senate in 1980, Davis' environmental voting record in his first 
five years was fairly typical of Republicans in the upper house, according to 
League of Conservation Voters figures. 
</P>
<P>
The league each year compiles scores based on how legislators voted on a number 
of key environmental bills. In his early Senate years, Davis' record fluctuated 
between 24% and 50%. But in 1986, Davis' record soared to 92%. He dipped to 38% 
the following year but jumped to 85% in 1988. Last year, the Senate's other 13 
Republicans ranged from 39% to 82%. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' score stands in even more marked contrast to those of Republican 
Assembly members whose districts overlap his. Assembly members Tom McClintock 
of Thousand Oaks and Cathie Wright of Simi Valley both scored 15% in 1988; 
Marian W. La Follette of Northridge scored 28%. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sticks out among fellow Republicans, Davis still scores below most 
Senate Democrats, who averaged 89% last year. Six Democrats posted 100% 
records, and even the lowest-ranked Democrat, Rose Ann Vuich of Dinuba, had an 
81% record. 
</P>
<P>
"He tends to take risks, and he's more statesmanlike than most legislators," 
said state Sen. Bill Lockyer, a Hayward Democrat who had a 100% ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"That may be because of his age. He's said he's an old guy, and he's going to 
do what he wants to in spite of what people think." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by Development 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that in the past few years, he has become alarmed as developers 
built more and more homes in his far-flung district, which meanders from 
Woodland Hills in Los Angeles County to Santa Maria in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
He has been particularly critical of developers in the Santa Clarita Valley, 
where he moved in 1984, charging that the region has been raped by builders 
whose projects have brought noise, traffic, pollution and other problems to a 
once-pristine area. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' embrace of preservation mirrors a concerted attempt by Republicans at 
the state and national levels to capture the issue, long considered the 
Democratic Party's political property. Burdened with the image of former 
Secretary of the Interior James Watt, Republicans have sought to return to that 
of Teddy Roosevelt, an outdoorsman and founder of the national parks system, as 
GOP voters increasingly worry about polluted air and water, overdevelopment and 
traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based political consultant, said Republicans 
representing California's coastal regions are under growing pressure to change 
their stances from yuppie Republicans who have flooded into their districts. 
These youngish, well-educated and well-salaried voters are highly responsive to 
environmental issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, they can't just hold onto their office by being fiscal 
conservatives," Hoffenblum said. "They've got to look at social and 
environmental issues too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hot Political Topic 
</P>
<P>
And the environment has become a hot political topic among many residents of 
Davis' heavily Republican district, which contains portions of two national 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 poll, for instance, 96% of Santa Clarita residents said they viewed 
traffic congestion as a serious problem. When the city was incorporated two 
years ago, the City Council promptly declared a moratorium on cutting the 
valley's treasured oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' views on growth have led him to tangle repeatedly with the Los Angeles 
County Local Agency Formation Commission, an agency that oversees the 
establishment of new cities. Davis has criticized the agency for being 
dominated by developers and for blocking local incorporation drives aimed at 
slowing development. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers suggest that Davis may merely be responding to constituent 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"In Republican suburbs, the no-growth movement is getting stronger than in some 
Democratic areas," Lockyer said. "He may . . . just be tuning in to that 
growing body of opinion in his area." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis says he always has been concerned with conservation, dating back to 
his boyhood, when he dreamed of being a forest ranger, and to his job as a tree 
surgeon for the Los Angeles parks department in the mid-1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has also long been an independent thinker -- and equally independent 
voter, often to the consternation of his GOP colleagues in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a doctrinaire Republican. . . . I try to think out each issue 
individually," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'React in Knee-Jerk Fashion' 
</P>
<P>
"The parties tend to react in knee-jerk fashion. The Republicans are the good 
old boys who protect the free enterprise system and overlook something like 
taking a mountain out, where Democrats can become offended by that." 
</P>
<P>
As an example of his occasional breakaway voting, he favored a 1984 bill 
banning job discrimination against homosexuals, which prompted conservatives to 
criticize him. Although he is a longtime opponent of abortion, he startled many 
last month by announcing that he favors Medi-Cal paying for abortions for poor 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he has a world view that makes him automatically susceptible" to 
arguments in favor of environmentalism, said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive 
director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which buys land to be set 
aside for state parks. 
</P>
<P>
"But he is somebody who will look at the facts as he sees them. He really is a 
sucker for a logical argument."

JOHNSON'S THREE SCORING PASSES GIVE UCLA 24-6 WIN OVER CAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bret Johnson threw for 166 yards and three touchdowns Saturday as UCLA extended 
its winning streak against California to 18 games by beating the Golden Bears, 
24-6, in front of 50,183 fans at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a redshirt freshman, completed 14 of 18 passes without being 
intercepted as the Bruins (2-2) won their Pacific 10 Conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
Cal, which hasn't beaten UCLA since 1971, fell to 0-2 in Pac-10 play and 1-3 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson put UCLA ahead for good by throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to Charles 
Arbuckle with 6:26 left in the second quarter. Johnson's five-yard scoring pass 
to Paul Richardson 20 seconds before halftime gave the Bruins a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's third touchdown pass came on a 48-yard play to Richardson with 4:54 
left in the third quarter, and Alfredo Velasco kicked a 48-yard field goal with 
40 seconds left in the quarter to make it 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's Robbie Keen kicked his second field goal of the game, a 34-yarder with 
7:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The first time the Golden Bears had the ball, they ate up 7 minutes 26 seconds 
while moving from their own 11-yard line to the UCLA one before the drive 
stalled and Keen kicked a 19-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't appear that Cal would stay on top for long -- the Bruins took the 
ensuing kickoff and moved from their own 34-yard line to a first-and-goal at 
the Golden Bears' one. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Cal defense held the Bruins to no gain on two plays, and on third 
down, Johnson fumbled as he tried to sneak into the end zone, and Travis Oliver 
recovered for the Golden Bears. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the play, the Bruins were hit with an unsportsmanlike 
conduct penalty and Frank Cornish, their starting center, was ejected from the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Cal then drove to the UCLA 43-yard line before linebacker Marvcus Patton 
intercepted a pass by Troy Taylor at the Bruins' 29. 
</P>
<P>
That set up a 71-yard, 13-play UCLA scoring drive which was capped by the 
Johnson-to-Arbuckle pass on a third-and-seven play. 
</P>
<P>
Cal tried a trick play from punt formation at the UCLA 48-yard line 2:23 before 
halftime, but it failed when Keen's long pass was well overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins went 52 yards on nine plays, scoring on the first 
Johnson-to-Richardson pass, which came in a third-and-goal situation.

PADRES WIN; GWYNN CLOSES IN ON CLARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's that time of year again. The whiskers are growing in the Padre clubhouse, 
and Tony Gwynn is trying to win a batting title. 
</P>
<P>
Several players are starting their winter beards -- the Padres have a no-beard 
rule during the season -- and are ready to scatter on vacation after this 
afternoon's season finale. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, meanwhile, is preparing for a few more at bats today in his bid to 
become the first National Leaguer to win three consecutive batting titles since 
Stan Musial (1950-1952). 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn went three for four in Saturday night's 11-5 Padre victory over San 
Francisco, improving his average to .3333. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' Will Clark got one hit in four at-bats and stands at .3339. Clark 
is attempting to become the first Giant to win a batting title since Willie 
Mays hit .345 for the New York Giants in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
A Fan Appreciation night crowd of 45,902 cheered each of Gwynn's plate 
appearances and booed each of Clark's. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big night for Gwynn, who trailed Clark by three points entering the 
game, .334 to .331. But Gwynn got hits in each of his first three at bats -- 
two singles and a double. 
</P>
<P>
He received a standing ovation after his third hit, the double in the fifth. At 
that point, Gwynn trailed Clark, .334 to .3339. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I'd have to hit like this just to have a legitimate shot," Gwynn said. 
"Our pitchers did a good job on Will, and going three for four, that puts me in 
a position to win it. That's all I can ask for." 
</P>
<P>
And so the batting race, which came down to this weekend, now comes down to 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have it this way," Gwynn said. "Head to head. One guy gets a hit, 
you see first hand what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
Clark disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd prefer it not to be this way," Clark said. "The reason is that there are 
4,500 questions about this every day. It's getting distracting. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at it overall, you've still got to go out and play the game. It's 
not a two-man batting show. You have to go out there and win." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, victories are nice. But the Giants have won the division and will open 
the NL playoffs Tuesday in Chicago. The Padres have clinched second place. 
</P>
<P>
So you can bet that each man will be out there trying to win a batting title 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"Yep, that's about all that's left," Clark said. "Whoever gets the most hits 
wins." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "If we came down to this weekend needing to win games, I'd do 
whatever I needed to do to do that. Now, I can do whatever I want to. If it's 
three and oh, I think they'd let me swing. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year when I won it, we were out of the division race. I was more free 
with what they let me do. They didn't ask me to move runners over and sacrifice 
-- they let me swing the bat." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn said Padre Manager Jack McKeon has given him the go-ahead to do whatever 
he needs. Which won't be much different than normal, Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's better to do the usual," Gwynn said. "If I get too anxious, I 
usually just make an out and end up talking to myself. But I know I'm not going 
to get the title by walking. So I'm trying to work the count and get three 
hits." 
</P>
<P>
But there's a flip side. While Gwynn has freedom, he also is finding it a bit 
more difficult to concentrate now that the Padres have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough last night," Gwynn said of Friday loss to the Giants. "I'm not 
going to lie. Coming to the ballpark yesterday was tough. 
</P>
<P>
"In a pennant race, every out is important. Then, when you're out of it, every 
out isn't important anymore. It was tough at first, but when I got in the 
batter's box, I was able to lock in without too many problems." 
</P>
<P>
And while your concentration level drops, your consciousness is raised -- you 
become more conscious of long games and nagging injuries. Gwynn has been 
bothered for a long time by his Achilles heel, while Clark missed four games a 
week-and-a-half ago with a deep bone bruise in his left shin. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is playing in pain for two reasons. First, he doesn't want to back into 
the batting title. And he is getting himself ready for the Cubs next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to get my swing back and my concentration level up," Clark said. 
"Whether we're up 12 (games) or down 12, my job is to play. I didn't get to 
this point by sitting out injuries." 
</P>
<P>
So, with the batting title there for the taking today, Clark said he will keep 
his philosophy simple. 
</P>
<P>
"Try to get up there and hit the ball as hard as possible," he said. "Exactly 
what I've done for my other 600-and-some (actually 584) at-bats this year." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the batting race, the Padres had a couple of noteworthy performances 
Saturday night as McKeon played several youngsters for the second night in a 
row: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. and first baseman Phil Stephenson each hit their 
first major league home runs. Alomar's, a three-run homer, came in the fourth. 
Stephenson's, with the bases empty, led off the second. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar was one for four and Stephenson three for four. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outfielder Jerald Clark was one for five, but his hit was a big one. He 
doubled two runs home in the Padres' four-run fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortstop Joey Cora got two hits, finishing the evening two for four. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Grant, pitching in relief of Eric Nolte, allowed just three hits and 
one run in five innings. He struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
Nolte didn't fare well. He lasted just four innings, allowing six hits and four 
runs (three earned). He walked three, struck out two and threw two wild 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tim Flannery was honored during pregame ceremonies on his first day as a 
retired baseball player. It was declared "Tim Flannery Day" by the San Diego 
City Council. Flannery's children, Daniel, 4, and Virginia Lynn, 2, were each 
given $25,000 college scholarship funds by the Padres. Flannery was given a 
surfboard by a local radio station, a guitar from the television station for 
which he will work and a plaque from the San Diego Hall of Champions, where he 
will be an honorary lifetime member. Flannery's mother and father, his wife, 
Donna, and their two children stood near home plate with him throughout the 
ceremony. The program concluded with a video tribute to Flannery on the Diamond 
Vision scoreboard, accompanied by Bob Seger's "Like A Rock." Flannery and his 
wife were then greeted in front of the Padre dugout as they left the field, 
receiving handshakes and hugs from players, coaches and Manager Jack McKeon 
during a three-minute standing ovation . . . Things weren't so sentimental 
before the game in the clubhouse, where several players used the occasion to 
get off some final zingers at Flannery's expense. "Whoooo my God, he's got 
socks on," Tony Gwynn shrieked when Flannery entered the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said all of the Padre coaches have been invited back for next season. . 
. . The Padres closed the clubhouse for a few minutes before the game during a 
rare visit from club President Dick Freeman, who wanted to thank the team for a 
good season. . . . Gwynn has had a chance to read a manuscript of George Will's 
baseball book, scheduled for release before the start of next season, and Gwynn 
gave it a good review. "It's good reading," Gwynn said. "It really is. I got 
caught up in it." Will wrote the book in four sections: hitting, fielding, 
pitching and managing. Gwynn was the featured batter. The only problem Gwynn 
found was that Will misspelled the name of Gwynn's daughter, Anisha Nicole. . . 
. Greg Harris (7-9) is scheduled to oppose Kelly Downs (4-7) in today's season 
finale at 1:05 p.m.

BREAKS OF THE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
IT WAS A BAD BREAK FOR U.S. SOCCER TEAM MEMBER PAUL KRUMPE THAT GAVE THE 
TALENTED LADY TOROS THE ASSISTANT COACH THEY NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Krumpe's bad break has turned into a very good one for Cal State Dominguez 
Hills soccer Coach Marine Cano. 
</P>
<P>
Late in August, Cano was desperately searching for an assistant women's soccer 
coach, and Krumpe, captain of the U.S. national team, was bored hanging out in 
his Redondo Beach townhouse waiting for a cast to be removed from his right 
leg, which he broke last spring while playing in Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
In the last month, the two former professional soccer players have teamed to 
guide the unbeaten Lady Toros to the No. 2 spot in the nation among Division II 
schools. And Krumpe, who had no previous coaching experience, says he's 
considering a career change. 
</P>
<P>
Although he holds an engineering degree from UCLA, he says, "I'm having so much 
fun coaching, I think I want to stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of West Torrance High School, where he played on the Warriors' 1980 
Southern Section 4A championship soccer team, Krumpe, 26, came to be Cano's 
assistant more by chance than by design. 
</P>
<P>
In late August, he read a story in The Times about how Cano had lost both of 
his assistant coaches to Division I jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't just hire anyone," Cano said at the time. "I want a quality person." 
</P>
<P>
Krumpe figured Cano needed a good break. 
</P>
<P>
"I called him," said Krumpe. "I was available." 
</P>
<P>
More than a month into the season, Cano is convinced that Krumpe is the person 
he was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a wealth of knowledge," Cano said. "He's an asset because he's coming 
off the national team, and he knows the newest tactics available 
internationally. He gives us a new look." 
</P>
<P>
The pair have worked well together, players and administrators at Dominguez 
Hills agree. Said senior sweeper Laura Moses: "Paul is a great coach. He knows 
the game very well, and he sees the entire picture." 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Dan Guerrero has found Krumpe to be more than a pleasant 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul brought a level of expertise to the coaching staff that enhances the 
ability and skills of Marine Cano," Guerrero said. "He has great interpersonal 
skills and communicates well with the athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Finding the right person for the job was frustrating to Cano, who knew that the 
Lady Toros had the potential to be among the best teams in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Cano coaches the men's and women's soccer teams simultaneously at Dominguez 
Hills. Because of scheduling conflicts, he cannot be with both teams all the 
time; sometimes his assistant coaches have to take over. In former English 
soccer professional John Gerrard, Cano has a men's assistant he trusts and 
respects; he sought a similar person to help with the women. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a close-knit group of girls," Cano explained. "If they don't like 
someone, I know we are going to have a rough time." 
</P>
<P>
Krumpe joined the team after practice had begun, but he jumped into the role 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first assignments was to coach the women's team in a game against 
Cal State San Bernardino at Alta Vista Park in Redondo Beach on Sept. 9. It 
turned out to be a long day for Krumpe, who had not slept the night before 
because his wife, Kati, had gone into labor with their first child. Their son, 
Tyler, was born just hours before game time, giving Krumpe barely enough time 
for a goodby kiss at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Krumpe sought a position in the aerospace industry to tide him 
over while his leg healed. But he had difficulty finding one that would fit 
into a schedule that included physical therapy and surgery to correct a very 
rare form of stress fracture in the navicular bone, a boat-shaped structure in 
the lower leg. Krumpe compares his injury to the nagging foot problem that 
sidelined former UCLA basketball player Bill Walton for much of his 
professional career. 
</P>
<P>
"My doctor figures there have only been about two dozen cases like mine," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Krumpe's playing status is still in doubt. He has a tiny screw embedded in the 
injured leg, and he says his doctors are not sure whether it can ever be 
removed. If it can, that means more surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Krumpe says he expects to be back in time for a crucial U.S. match with 
Trinidad and Tobago on Nov. 19. The game is expected to decide which team 
qualifies for the final 1990 World Cup berth. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler is gambling that Krumpe will return, although Krumpe can 
still be seen hobbling around Lady Toros practices in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
"Without him, we'll have to take (them) one at a time," Gansler said of three 
World Cup qualifiers the U.S. must play this fall. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch the other day in the campus cafeteria, Cano argued with Krumpe about 
his planned date of return to international action. Krumpe, raising his casted 
leg, insisted that he has plenty of time to prepare for a return. 
</P>
<P>
Cano wasn't so sure. He was thinking about the Division II playoffs, which 
might interfere with Krumpe's comeback because they will be held about the same 
time the United States trains for the Trinidad game. 
</P>
<P>
That discussion shows how important a role Krumpe is playing at Dominguez Hills 
this season. "He's a thinker, an organizer," said Cano. "He's a motivator too." 
</P>
<P>
Krumpe has been good for the feisty Cano for a number of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a vocal guy," Cano said. "He is toned down a bit, although he can be more 
vocal than me if he wants, sometimes. But that's good for me, because now I can 
relax a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Krumpe would have no problem making a career in coaching, according to UCLA 
Coach Sigi Schmid. 
</P>
<P>
"As a coach, you have to make decisions that aren't always understood 
immediately, or aren't very popular at first with the players," he said. "Paul 
has the character and the backbone to do that." 
</P>
<P>
At West Torrance, Krumpe was an all-Southern Section selection as a midfielder, 
but when he got to UCLA, Schmid thought he would be better in the backfield, 
the same area he has patrolled on the national team as a right fullback. 
</P>
<P>
"We converted him because we thought he had the skills and instincts to score 
goals from the backfield," Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at UCLA, Krumpe was named the Bruins' team captain. He finished his 
college career among the school's top 10 in career assists and, despite his 
role as a defender, scored 12 goals. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to play two seasons with the Chicago Sting of the Major Indoor 
Soccer League and was a member of the U.S. Olympic Team in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to soccer experts, Krumpe is not the most gifted of athletes, 
although when he is playing he keeps himself in great condition. They add, 
however, that he displays so many intangible qualities on the field that it 
would be hard to pass him over. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the ability to motivate people and make others play better," Schmid 
said. "His return will raise the level of play on the national team." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler, the national team's coach, saw the same qualities. He could have cut 
Krumpe after the injury but instead has assured the fullback that there is a 
place for him on the team if he can come back. 
</P>
<P>
"I like his approach to the game," Gansler said. "He has a very mature approach 
to the game and is a good influence on the team. He's got his life in order, 
and it carries over to the way he plays." 
</P>
<P>
When Krumpe first arrived on the scene at Dominguez Hills, he hobbled onto the 
field on his crutches. He found it difficult to get into the action because he 
wanted to be out on the field demonstrating. But, as good breaks go, Krumpe 
eventually turned the crutches into a teaching aid. 
</P>
<P>
"They helped me verbalize more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moses discovered that early. 
</P>
<P>
"He really helps me read the game," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for a career in coaching, Krumpe says he'll take the breaks one at a time.

CLU FALLS TO UCSB ON FIELD GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
UC Santa Barbara's Brian Fleming experienced a kicker's nightmare when he was 
flattened by a block on a 96-yard scoring return by Cal Lutheran's Cassidy 
O'Sullivan, but Todd Reynolds lived a kicker's dream when he hit a 
school-record 50-yard field goal to give UCSB a 24-21 nonconference win at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' kick came with 5:13 remaining and saved UCSB (2-2) after O'Sullivan 
had pulled Cal Lutheran (1-3) into a 21-21 tie with his touchdown return on the 
first play of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The nightmare for Fleming was being leveled by 6-foot-4, 300-pound Ken Whitney 
on the play. O'Sullivan fumbled the kick, picked the ball up, cut left, then 
headed for the right sideline and sprang free behind Whitney's crushing block. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous so I dropped it. I was trying to concentrate, but I looked 
upfield too fast," said O'Sullivan, a freshman who returned six kickoffs for 
touchdowns in high school but had his first touchdown as a Kingsmen. "Ken 
Whitney made everything go." 
</P>
<P>
A fired-up Cal Lutheran defense stopped UCSB on three plays after O'Sullivan's 
touchdown, but fullback Dan Smeester fumbled on the ensuing series. For the 
third time this season, Cal Lutheran went into the fourth quarter with a chance 
to win, and lost. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't quite have the poise at the end to rally back. That's 
disappointing," Cal Lutheran Coach Bob Shoup said. "I thought we could win this 
ballgame. I still feel we played statistically well enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran had 21 first downs to UCSB's 17, controlled the ball for 32:05, 
converted 13 of 21 third- and fourth-down plays and had 16 more net yards. 
However, UCSB had no turnovers and consistently came up with big plays. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran tied the score, 14-14, when freshman quarterback Eddie Hoffman hit 
Shane Hawkins with an 18-yard touchdown pass with 1:28 remaining in the first 
half, but former Agoura High star Steve Armstrong immediately led the Gauchos 
on a 63-yard touchdown march in little more than a minute. Armstrong, who 
completed 16 of 29 passes for 184 yards, threw his third touchdown pass of the 
first half to give the Gauchos a 21-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman rushed for 47 yards and scored Cal Lutheran's first touchdown on a 
three-yard run.

HAWTHORNE SLAMS DOOR ON PALOS VERDES, 20-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes High football Coach Bill Judy predicted that his team would have 
to hold Hawthorne under 10 points to have a chance of winning Friday's Bay 
League opener. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Sea Kings could have shut out Hawthorne and still not 
triumphed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our offense is that bad," Judy said after Hawthorne's 20-0 
victory at Palos Verdes. "I think their defense is that good. They're awfully 
quick. They just overran us." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars made it another long afternoon for Judy, who has lost six times 
without a win to Hawthorne in seven years as Palos Verdes' head coach. 
</P>
<P>
It was same scenario Friday. Hawthorne simply had too many athletes for the Sea 
Kings to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (4-0) were especially dominating on defense. They limited Palos 
Verdes to 127 yards rushing and prevented Sea Kings quarterback Blake Anderson 
from completing a pass (0 for 9, one interception). 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have much time," said a banged-up Anderson, who was tackled for eight 
losses. "They blitzed a lot. We couldn't stop them." 
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive shutout for Hawthorne, which has not allowed a 
point since giving up a touchdown to Hueneme in the first quarter of its first 
game. The Cougars have outscored the opposition, 75-7. 
</P>
<P>
"No team scores on them," Judy said. "I thought if we didn't give up the big 
one, somewhere along the line we would be able to punch it in." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (3-1) prevented the "big one" until the third quarter, when 
Hawthorne erupted for all its points. Backup quarterback Kalvein Latu returned 
the second-half kickoff 78 yards for a touchdown, tailback Chris Alexander ran 
92 yards for a TD on the next possession and quarterback Jamil Williams scored 
on a four-yard sneak, set up by an interception. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had to execute," Hawthorne Coach Goy Casillas said of his team's 
second-half turnaround. "We had to play Hawthorne football." 
</P>
<P>
Judy said the kickoff return by Latu was a crushing emotional blow. "You could 
see the blood being pulled out (of us) right there." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne arguably has the South Bay's best pair of inside linebackers in 
seniors Sione Mahe (6-foot-3, 215 pounds) and Anthony Smith (6-2, 202). They 
were in on nearly every tackle Friday, and Smith's 37-yard interception return 
to the Palos Verdes 5-yard line set up the Cougars' third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a linebacker a few years ago by the name of Robert Morris who was 
all-everything," Casillas said. "Sione Mahe is definitely in that category, and 
Anthony Smith is right behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"They complement each other. One (Mahe) is very physical, and one (Smith) is 
very quick." 
</P>
<P>
Casillas also lauded the play of Alexander, the speedy tailback who led all 
rushers with 149 yards on 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that Alexander was going to be a good one," the coach said. "He was 
good last year until he broke his arm." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander's junior football season was cut short because of the injury, but he 
returned in the spring to help Hawthorne capture the state track title with a 
fifth-place finish in the 100 meters (10.68 seconds). 
</P>
<P>
The 5-10, 175-pounder gave Palos Verdes a demonstration of his speed on his 
92-yard touchdown run. Although several defenders appeared to have an angle on 
him, Alexander sprinted untouched up the right sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Said Alexander: "I just tell the line to get me past the line of scrimmage and 
I'll do the rest." 
</P>
<P>
It's finally over. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne's string of 23 consecutive losses, the longest skid in the state, came 
to a dramatic end Friday as the Gauchos pulled out a 23-20 victory over 
visiting L.A. Wilson on a 46-yard field goal by Wilfred Rodriguez on the last 
play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically, Narbonne did it the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos blew a chance to take the lead with 57 seconds left when a low snap 
by Richard Fordiani botched the extra-point attempt. It ironically came after 
Fordiani's diving, three-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Mike Ramirez 
had tied the game, 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
But a coaching blunder by Wilson gave Narbonne another scoring chance. 
</P>
<P>
After three incomplete passes, Wilson quarterback Feliciano Ramirez was 
instructed by his coaches to down the ball at his team's 31 on fourth down. The 
change of possession stopped the clock long enough for Narbonne to rush its 
field-goal unit into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect Narbonne's celebration to last more than a week, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos open Southern-Pacific Conference play Friday night against Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills football Coach Gary Kimbrell was understandably disappointed 
after his team committed six turnovers and lost its Bay League opener against 
Beverly Hills, 21-14, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (3-1) had looked sharp in their non-league wins over Redondo, Mira 
Costa and North Torrance, but Kimbrell sensed there was something wrong before 
the game at Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not ready to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell hopes his team regroups by Friday. That's when Rolling Hills plays 
host to Bay League favorite Leuzinger (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
Because of an editing error, a headline in Friday's South Bay sports section 
reversed the winner and loser of the Rolling Hills-Beverly Hills football game. 
The story carried a correct account. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cormier, Jeff Kimball and John Karambulas each scored two goals to lead 
Palos Verdes over visiting Miraleste, 8-7, in a non-league game Friday matching 
the premier water polo teams in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Karambulas' second goal made it 8-6 and turned out to be the game-winner, as 
the No. 9-ranked team in the CIF-Southern Section 3-A Division prevailed over 
the No. 6-ranked team in the 2-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste's Kyle Hildebrand led all scorers with four goals, three coming on 
penalty shots. Zoltan Gyurko added two goals for the Marauders (5-5). 
</P>
<P>
In other events: 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger romped to a 40-0 win over Inglewood on Thursday, but the Olympians 
didn't come out of their Bay League football opener unscathed. Wide receiver 
Quang Banks, who caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Zak Odom, 
suffered a knee injury and is listed as "doubtful" for Friday's game at Rolling 
Hills. . . . South Torrance football Coach Don Morrow, formerly the offensive 
coordinator at Redondo, came back to beat his old team Thursday as the Spartans 
(1-3) posted their first win, 23-21, in an Ocean League opener. . . . How much 
does Coast Christian miss Earl Rhodes, the running back who was declared 
ineligible this season because he had already completed eight semesters of high 
school? Last year, with Rhodes, Coast Christian beat Chadwick in an eight-man 
game, 22-21. Friday, the Rhodes-less Saints fell to Chadwick, 47-0, to drop to 
0-3-1. . . . Serra improved to 4-0 Friday with a 22-7 win over Saddleback and 
has now outscored its opponents, 144-27. . . . Bishop Montgomery (3-1) extended 
its winning streak to three games Friday with a 20-0 non-league victory over 
Pius X.

EL CAMINO WINS THE GRUDGE MATCH; 
</P>
<P>
WARRIORS DEFEAT FULLERTON, 31-24 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
The night of Oct. 1, 1988, was one El Camino Coach John Featherstone would have 
probably liked to forget, but couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
He can put those memories to rest now. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, in a battle of two pass-happy offenses, Featherstone and El 
Camino took a measure of revenge from Fullerton College with a 31-24 victory at 
Fullerton District Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The payback came almost exactly a year after El Camino's last loss -- a 
heartbreaking 38-36 setback to Fullerton, then ranked No. 1 in the state. That 
loss snapped a 13-game El Camino winning streak and marred what was nearly a 
perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, El Camino (3-0) withstood a last-ditch Fullerton comeback and 
held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton trimmed the El Camino lead to 31-24 when Jeff Andrews took a pitch 
four yards around the left side for a touchdown with 3:25 left in the game. But 
Kevin Leon's attempt at an on-side kick squibbed untouched out of bounds before 
it went 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino got on the board first in Saturday night's grudge match when flanker 
David Blakes leaped high to snare a three-yard touchdown pass from Frank Dolce. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton roared right back to take a 10-7 lead on a 13-yard touchdown pass 
from David Chisum to tight end Richard Nelson, and Eric Lange's 20-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
But El Camino dominated both sides of the ball from that point on. An 80-yard 
second-quarter drive was capped when tailback Alfred Lowe took a pitch around 
the left end four yards for a touchdown. Lowe added a 13-yard TD dash in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Cole's interception set up the second El Camino touchdown of the 
quarter. On first down, Dolce receiver hit Shannon Thompson, who juked his way 
62 yards across the middle to the Fullerton 14. Dolce capped the drive on a 
three-yard bootleg. 
</P>
<P>
Dolce, who started slowly, got on track to complete 20 of 40 passes for 305 
yards and a touchdown. Blakes was his favorite receiver, catching six passes 
for 90 yards, and Khevin Pratt caught three for 68 yards. The running game was 
virtually non-existent: Al Savea led El Camino with 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's defense sacked Chisum five times, twice by defensive end Jeffery 
Cummins, once each by Gregory Franklin and Tracy Gentry, and once on a safety 
blitz by Niu Sale.

CROSS-COUNTRY STARTS WITH PALOS VERDES GIRLS FAVORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes High School's cross-country teams have enjoyed a tremendous 
winning tradition in the last 20 years. The success has been attributed to 
everything from a strong running tradition in the community to the relatively 
clean air on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
There have even been hushed accusations that Palos Verdes coaches recruit their 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sea Kings are guilty of only one thing, says ninth-year Coach Joe 
Kelly: "Our kids are totally committed. We run cross-country differently than 
some schools. We have many more kids working much harder. They've got a great 
work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
They've also got a great record. Since 1974, the Palos Verdes High's boys and 
girls teams have combined for seven CIF-Southern Section championships, four 
second-place finishes and two state titles. 
</P>
<P>
The boys have won 16 of the last 18 Bay League championships, and the girls 
have won the last nine. In recent years, the girls haven't stopped at the 
league championship; they have won four consecutive Southern Section 4-A titles 
and back-to-back Division I state crowns. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly realizes that while the past triumphs are nice, they can't carry the team 
this year. Neither the boys nor the girls have run on a flat, standard-length 
course, so Kelly says he "has no idea where we are right now." 
</P>
<P>
Opposing coaches have a pretty good idea. They've ranked the Palos Verdes girls 
No. 1 in the 4-A Division and the boys No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a closer look at the Sea Kings and other top teams in the South Bay, 
beginning with the girls: 
</P>
<P>
"We've graduated four quality seniors," Kelly said of Palos Verdes, "but we 
have some good young girls coming up." The biggest loss was Ashley Black, an 
all-state performer. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Maya Muneno, a varsity letter winner in '88, leads a close pack of 
Sea King harriers. Juniors Karen Zareski and Joanna Della Gatta are "extremely 
committed runners," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers include sophomore Yoko Senga and freshman Tammy Wilcox. Senior 
Cindy Scribe adds valuable experience. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their youth, the Sea Kings are prohibitive favorites in the Bay League. 
They've already won the Royal Invitational at Moorpark College. "I can't see 
anybody challenging them," Torrance Coach Jerry Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance Coaches Greg Houlgate and LuAnne Howard were pleasantly surprised 
by their team's performance at the Warren Invitational last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Angie Parks, daughter of the late West Coach Ron Parks, led the team. 
Julie Shepard, Kelly Chang and Kathy Cabuno also ran well and could tilt the 
balance of power in the Ocean League in West's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa Coach Dave Holland, whose brother Jerry coaches at Torrance, is 
trying to nurture a strong cross-country tradition like Palos Verdes'. The 
Mustang girls were CIF champs in 1981 and '82, though they have slipped in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Joanne Ulibarri has the potential to win the Ocean League individual 
championship. Holland said Ulibarri has a tendency to lose concentration but 
has performed well in early meets, placing fifth in the senior division at the 
Laguna Hills Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa figures to battle West Torrance and Redondo for the Ocean League 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"This Banning team could be better than the one that won the City championship 
in '78," Coach Don Mulligan said. Mulligan did not predict an L.A. City title, 
but the Pacific League championship is within reach. 
</P>
<P>
Luci Mendoza, the City 10th-grade champion in '87, leads the team with a year 
of varsity experience. Junior Elva Robles and senior Maura Castillo are the 
other top runners. Sophomore Elizabeth Aguilar is a promising newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Mocnik is in his 13th year of coaching cross country at Carson, but 
his enthusiasm has not waned. Part of the reason is senior Noelle Ragland, a 
track sprinter who was the Pacific League champion last year. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Jellerine Venadas is another young Colt who should improve and 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance is in for a tough year, according to Coach Jerry Holland. Sophomore 
Jessica Reifer, a soccer player by trade, is the team's top runner. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste, ranked No. 9 in the Southern Section 1-A poll, is another team to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
Last season was rough for the Palos Verdes boys. Not only did the girls' team 
steal the national spotlight, but the Sea King boys failed to win the Bay 
League championship for only the second time in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Kelly and his charges are determined to knock off '88 champs Beverly 
Hills and bring the Bay League championship trophy back to "The Hill." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the repossession effort are senior Sean Yoder, juniors Aaron Rogers and 
Joe Snider, and sophomores Dennis Yu and Goss Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
The five are currently running 28 seconds apart and helped Palos Verdes finish 
second at the Royal Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Pose of Torrance won the junior division at the Warren Invitational, 
giving hope that the Tartars can challenge Palos Verdes and Beverly Hills for 
the Bay League title. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Jerry Holland said the other runners on the team must approach Pose, 
including seniors Shin Nishihara and Aaron Morris. Morris is a converted pole 
vaulter who has run cross-country for only two years. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Houlgate of West Torrance said his team is deep and should win 
the Ocean League championship. West is ranked No. 8 in the Southern Section 3-A 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
Last week at the Warren Invitational, the Warriors came in fifth, losing only 
to Torrance among area teams. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Miles came in third overall with a three-mile time of 15:28, followed on 
the team by Andy Kim and Kenji Sumino. Houlgate said he was pleasantly 
surprised by the performance of two newcomers, sophomore Geoff DeLahante and 
junior Bryan Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Tim Forney's Bishop Montgomery Knights placed third in the tough 
Angelus League to make their first post-season appearance in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Joe McDonald, the winner in his age group at the Palos Verdes marathon 
last summer, will try to lead the Knights back to championship competition. 
Senior team captain Matt Simons is another standout, while first-time 
cross-country runner Erik Germain is also expected to do well. Pushing the pack 
will be senior Ricardo Vargas and juniors Lucian Shigg and Kevin Chalk. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Mocnik hopes youth will be served in the race for the City 
Section's Pacific League title. Junior Steven Gonzales showed tremendous 
promise as a 10th-grader, winning the City sophomore championship in the mile 
last spring and running the 3,200 meters in 9:33. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Raya is the defending Pacific League champion. He'll team with Raul 
Miglietti, Bill Stout and Gonzales to form a tough Colt foursome. "The key is 
finding a fifth man; then we could beat (Pacific League foes) Banning, Narbonne 
and San Pedro," Mocnik said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson will have trouble beating Banning if Pilot Coach Mulligan can develop 
the City's Bee champions into effective varsity runners. Junior Roman Rendon 
was the only runner to beat Carson's Gonzales last year and should be the 
team's top competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bryson, Efrain Berumen and Rafael Chavez are inexperienced, but their 
progress will be the key to Banning's title quest. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa Coach Dave Holland is expecting his Mustangs to run somewhere in the 
middle of the Ocean League. Scott Yetter and Jeff Fauber are the top runners.

Brutal reality of the kind Harbor College experienced last season made another 
unwelcome appearance at the Seahawks' Western State Conference home opener 
Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Bakersfield College scored early and often against Harbor, soundly 
defeating the Seahawks, 56-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Renegades (2-0-1, 1-0-1) used a strong running attack to quickly dominate 
the game. Harbor fell to 1-2, 0-2 in the WSC. 
</P>
<P>
Gino Valpredo got the scoring started for Bakersfield in the first quarter. His 
one-yard touchdown run capped a three-play, 45-yard drive. The Renegades scored 
three more times before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Valpredo scored his second touchdown on a seven-yard run in the second quarter, 
capping a 73-yard drive by the Renegades in 15 plays. 
</P>
<P>
Following an interception by Bakersfield's Jake Hogue, the Renegades needed 
just four plays to drive 30 yards for their next score, a 20-yard gallop by 
Nathan Dupree. 
</P>
<P>
Alexis Charles plunged into the end zone from the one-yard line to give 
Bakersfield a 26-0 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Seahawk punter Jose Rocha mishandled a snap from center and lost the ball to 
the Renegades' Joesph Cooper, who carried it into the end zone for another 
Bakersfield touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield took advantage of another Harbor mistake when Nick Harker's 
interception gave the Renegades the ball at the Seahawk 13. Quarterback Lance 
Geary wasted little time in hitting wide receiver Bu'Shawn Glover on an 
eight-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
Valpredo's third touchdown of the game, a four-yard run, increasing his team's 
lead to 49-0 at the end of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the final period, Bakersfield's Joesph Bobo ran for a touchdown to 
conclude the scoring.

L.A. Southwest 12, Valley 9 -- A holding penalty on the final play of the game 
wiped out what would have been the winning touchdown for Valley in a Western 
State Conference opener at Los Angeles Southwest College. 
</P>
<P>
With no time left, Valley quarterback Mark Mengoli threw a 12-yard pass to 
tight end Sean Brown for a touchdown and an apparent victory, but the play was 
nullified by the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest improved to 3-0 overall and 2-0 in the WSC Northern Division. Valley 
fell to 0-3, 0-2 in the Southern Division. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest scored the decisive points in the fourth quarter on a pair of Jason 
Thomson field goals. The first, from 26 yards with 11:34 left, tied the score, 
9-9. The second, from 17 yards, came with 2:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Manigo completed eight of 16 passes for 80 yards and scored the only 
Southwest touchdown on an 18-yard run in the first quarter. On the extra-point 
attempt, Valley blocked the kick and Scott Holden recovered and ran the ball 
back 97 yards for a safety. KEVIN LINDSEY

GLENDALE DEFEATS PIERCE, 43-15

<P>
Excuse the Pierce College football team if it is a little gun-shy about finding 
out who this week's opponent is. 
</P>
<P>
It's not more of those Vaqueros, is it? 
</P>
<P>
Give Pierce some Lions, Tigers or Bears -- anything but Vaqueros. They've 
already caused enough damage this season. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce lost its second consecutive Western State Conference game to a team 
nicknamed Vaqueros, falling, 43-15, Saturday night to the Glendale Vaqueros at 
Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Brahmas (1-2 overall, 0-2 in conference play) lost to the Santa 
Barbara Vaqueros, 28-20. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, which was allowing an average of 512 yards to opponents going into the 
game, gave up 469 to Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night for former Brahmas to shine. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Pierce quarterback Ronnie Lopez passed for one touchdown and ran for 
another. Lopez completed seven of eight passes for 131 yards. And former Brahma 
Wes Bender scored touchdowns on runs of one and 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dominic Mustin scored both Pierce touchdowns on second-half runs of 13 and two 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (1-1-1, 1-0-1) led, 21-0, at halftime and tacked on two third-quarter 
touchdowns -- one a 68-yard pass from quarterback Darren Fitzgerald to Pat 
Lynch -- to turn the game into a runaway. Fitzgerald was five of seven for 130 
yards and one touchdown. Lynch caught four passes for 137 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale scored on its first three offensive series. Bender, who transferred to 
Glendale this season, scored the first two Vaquero touchdowns. Glendale, which 
stayed primarily on the ground in the first half, increased its advantage to 
three touchdowns early in the second period when Doug Dragomer went three yards 
for a touchdown and David Bowen added his third conversion kick. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce was competitive from a statistical standpoint in the first half, gaining 
144 yards -- 92 from quarterback Jamie Grossman, who completed 10 of 18 passes 
with one interception in the half. Grossman finished 14 of 26 for 148 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale had 192 first-half yards, 137 on the ground. Sean Hampton led all 
first-half rushers with 75 yards in five carries for the Vaqueros. He finished 
with a game-leading 92 yards in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce twice hurt itself in the first half by committing turnovers on drives 
inside Glendale territory. Louis Vann fumbled the ball away at the Vaquero 40 
in the first period, and a Grossman pass was intercepted at the Glendale 13 by 
Ron Morgan late in the second quarter. JIM COLEMAN

OCCIDENTAL DENIES LA VERNE, 24-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Little figures to spend the next two weeks refining his ballcarrying 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
However, judging from his performance Saturday night against La Verne, that may 
be about the only thing the Occidental freshman needs to work on. 
</P>
<P>
Little compensated for four fumbles by rushing for 118 yards in 28 carries and 
scoring a touchdown as Occidental defeated La Verne, 24-12, in a Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference football game at Occidental's 
Patterson Field. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, which has a bye next week before resuming its schedule Oct. 14 
against the University of San Diego, improved to 3-1 overall and 2-0 in 
conference play. La Verne remains winless (0-3, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
"These guys were tougher and hit harder than the team we played last week," 
said Little, who gained 212 yards last Saturday against Pomona-Pitzer. "The 
fumbles were unusual for me." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental recovered two of Little's fumbles, including one that put the game 
away. The Tigers led, 17-12, with 9:09 left when Little burst toward the end 
zone on third and goal from the nine. He fumbled at the goal line, but 
offensive lineman Greg Garcia recovered in the end zone for the score. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown stymied La Verne's comeback from a 17-6 halftime deficit. The 
comeback was directed by senior quarterback Mark Brown, who completed 22 of 45 
passes for 212 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They started to plug up the middle and we couldn't get it (the ball) to our 
wideouts," Brown said. "If we had done that we probably would have had a couple 
more touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's pass defense, which had victimized the Tigers in their first two 
games of the season, made some key plays against La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Ramsey, a sophomore linebacker, had two interceptions, and freshman 
safety Rick Mock had one -- all in the first half when the Tigers built their 
17-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers' first break came on the opening kickoff when La Verne's Prentiss 
Pryor fumbled on the Leopards' seven-yard line after he was hit by a mob of 
Occidental tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental recovered, and two plays later tailback Kevin Vegas scored on a 
five-yard run to give Occidental a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne also took advantage of a turnover en route to its first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Leopards recovered a second-quarter fumble by Little at the Occidental 
36-yard line, then launched a 13-play drive that was capped by Brown's one-yard 
dive into the end zone with 7:07 left in the first half. Vince Alamillo's 
extra-point attempt was blocked, making the score, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental answered with a touchdown on its ensuing possession, which started 
with Jeremy Dickinson's 40-yard kickoff return that gave the Tigers a first 
down at the La Verne 45. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, following a 22-yard completion from quarterback Tony Werbelow 
to David Grossklaus, Little scampered 13 yards for the score, giving Occidental 
a 14-6 lead with 5:03 left in the half.

WHITTIER CHRISTIAN DOWNS BELL-JEFF

Estrada had 11 carries for 146 yards 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whittier Christian's Ron Papazian and Scott Jordan combined for 188 yards and 
four touchdowns in a nonleague game against Bellarmine-Jefferson on Saturday at 
Burroughs High. 
</P>
<P>
Then they played the second half. 
</P>
<P>
When it finally ended, Jordan -- a hard-running tailback -- had 203 yards in 23 
carries. Papazian, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound fullback, carried 20 times for 142 
yards and five touchdowns. And Whittier Christian, 4-0 and ranked third in the 
Division IX poll, accumulated more real estate than Donald Trump in a 42-0 win. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little surprised the offense executed so well," Whittier Coach Phil 
Bravo said. "We moved the ball pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
About the only manner in which Whittier might have moved the ball any better 
would have been to toss the football into the back of a Chevy and put it in 
overdrive. Whittier Christian was in fourth gear all night, gaining 399 rushing 
yards (7.1 yards a carry), 423 total yards and 18 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
"They completely manhandled us," Bell-Jeff Coach Doug Woodlief said. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier led, 28-0, at the half after four touchdown runs from Papazian, then 
added two more scores in the third quarter -- on a 46-yard scamper by Papazian 
and a two-yard run by Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan missed last week's game because of a bruised collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
How bad was it for Bell-Jeff? Whittier Christian faced first and 50 from its 
24, then scored three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier defense, meanwhile, limited Bell-Jeff to 48 total yards (31 
rushing in 20 carries) and three first downs. Bell-Jeff (0-3-1) had only nine 
total yards at the half and possession for five of the half's 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We were even more surprised with our defense," Bravo said. "(The defense) 
performed well in crucial times." 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night, the only crucial moment was the opening coin flip -- which 
Whittier Christian also won. JEFF RILEY In another game: Faith Baptist 23, 
Flintridge Prep 6 -- Alex Estrada had 11 carries for 146 yards and made a key 
interception for Faith Baptist in an eight-man game at Flintridge Prep. 
Estrada's interception on the one-yard line in the second quarter preserved a 
15-0 halftime lead. Quarterback Gavin Amos, who scored both first-half 
touchdowns on runs of two and one yard, had 10 carries for 33 yards and was 
five of 13 passing for 128 yards. Amos hit Steve Roe with a 69-yard scoring 
pass early in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Chris Bisgaard scored on a 
one-yard run in the fourth quarter for the only Flintridge Prep touchdown.

FEW FEARS ON THIS 'VIRGINIA WOOLF '; 
</P>
<P>
AUTHOR ALBEE DIRECTS TO KEEP CONTROL OF HIS PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With sunlight streaming into the living room of his suite at a West Hollywood 
low-profile/high-celebrity hotel, Edward Albee ruminated on what it's like to 
direct his own plays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new experience each time," he said. "This is only the second time I've 
directed 'Virginia Woolf.' I did it on Broadway in 1976 with Colleen Dewhurst 
and Ben Gazzara. It went very nicely, got good press. This time, I'm learning 
more about the play." 
</P>
<P>
"This time" refers to the production of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" that 
opens Wednesday as part of the Ahmanson season at the Doolittle Theatre in 
Hollywood. John Lithgow and Glenda Jackson are the warring George and Martha. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I have any specific problems with it," Albee said. "I think I 
know my way around the play by now. I know the pitfalls." 
</P>
<P>
Albee sat back on the couch, smiling, exuding confidence. His energetic 
demeanor belies his 61 years. His movements are brisk and their subtext one of 
intensely focused energy and effortless control. At a rehearsal later that 
week, he prowled the darkness like a cat, watchful and alert, taking as much 
from his actors as he was giving back. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, Jackson dominated, asking questions, suggesting crosses, rejecting 
them, trying something else. Earlier she had confessed to this writer that "the 
major hurdle here is (coming up with) an American accent that doesn't make 
every American cringe. Martha can't be English." Otherwise, she had added, 
almost as caustically as Martha, "the challenges are the same." 
</P>
<P>
"It's always difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Working with the playwright might have been a hurdle too, "because authors can 
be overly protective of their work," she said, "but that isn't the case with 
Edward, whom I find very open. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always exciting for me to work with Americans. They're so direct. 
American audiences are immediate in their responses. In England (they) tend to 
wait until the curtain comes down to express an opinion, which is too late for 
me. I like to know what's happening while it's happening." 
</P>
<P>
"George thinks much, much more quickly than I do," said the sunny John Lithgow, 
who conceded that George is a formidable challenge. "He's so cerebral, so 
incredibly in control. My instinct as an actor is to take a visceral approach, 
so initially, I tended to pound away, to treat George's very destructive games 
as bombast, dropping the nuclear bomb over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
"I used the brickbat approach instead of the stiletto. Edward is constantly 
asking me to take out the yelling and purr." 
</P>
<P>
But he's energized by Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very uncompromising, very attentive to foundation," he said. "We simply 
don't move on until we've solved the problem. She's become our bellwether. 
Glenda's discomfort guides us." 
</P>
<P>
It is partly to assert his grip over the dominion of his work that Albee, early 
on, chose to learn how to direct. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurred to me that an author who was a director as well could probably 
give a very accurate representation of the play he had in his head. I'd noticed 
that (Samuel) Beckett directed his plays, (Jean) Anouilh directed his, 
(Bertolt) Brecht directed his, Jack Gelber directed his. A lot of people, going 
back to Moliere and Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
"So I staged a production of 'The Zoo Story' in 1963 which, fortunately, played 
somewhere deep in Pennsylvania. I'd had no training. I just thought I could 
direct it. It was probably the worst production of any play of mine I'd ever 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was unable to communicate any of the thoughts that I had about it. It 
occurred to me then that there might be some craft involved and I started 
studying directing -- not going to director's school, but I'd watch others 
direct my work, and talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
He hand-picked his masters: Peter Hall ("A Delicate Balance" and "All Over"), 
Jean-Louis Barrault ("A Delicate Balance"), Ingmar Bergman and Franco Zefirelli 
("Virginia Woolf"). 
</P>
<P>
"I also started going to plays with that in mind," he said. "I'd read them 
first, imagined how I would direct them, then see them directed and figure out 
what the differences were. Then I just started directing more of my own stuff 
Off Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
His first major plunge as a director was the staging of seven of his one-act 
plays for a nationwide tour of universities ("Albee Directs Albee," 1968). Less 
than ten years later, in 1975, he took the leap directing his play "Seascape" 
on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't do too badly," he deadpanned. "It won the Pulitzer Prize and got 
very nice notices." The next year, Broadway saw his revival of "Virginia 
Woolf." 
</P>
<P>
"That gave me my sea legs, pretty much," he said. "I discovered I could get 
over this problem that actors -- more in theory than in fact -- are reputed to 
have, that playwrights should not direct their own work because they're too 
close to it. I separate myself very nicely. I can be severe with my own text. 
I'll cut it if it doesn't work. For the world premieres of some of my plays 
that I've directed, I'm much quicker to make changes. But I won't let another 
director do it." 
</P>
<P>
The reporter reminded the playwright of the flap that ensued when director Bill 
Ball "restructured" Albee's most impenetrable play, "Tiny Alice," at San 
Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he was rewriting Shakespeare and everybody else," Albee argued with mock 
flippancy, "why shouldn't he rewrite Albee? This was 'Tiny Alice.' Too 
confusing. He thought he would clarify it. And I thought his clarifications 
were further obfuscations. I also didn't like scenes and speeches moved from 
one act to another. I do compose my plays with a certain care and think things 
should be where they are." 
</P>
<P>
Through some bureaucratic slip, ACT had also neglected to acquire the rights to 
the play. This created a peculiar circumstance. "Had there been a signed 
contract, they would have been in violation of it," Albee said. "But there was 
no signed contract." 
</P>
<P>
Publisher Samuel French, Albee's agents and the Dramatists' Guild, he 
discovered, couldn't help, because there was no written agreement about which 
to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I could have gotten an injunction," he said, "but I was on my way to 
Japan for the State Department, having terrible back trouble, in an awful brace 
and in a very bad mood." 
</P>
<P>
So he held a press conference instead and brought enough ire to the situation 
to turn it around. When contracts were finally signed, the playwright exacted 
double royalties. And got them. 
</P>
<P>
Albee's contracts, in fact, carry more than the usual number of specifics. 
Aside from the customary protections that stipulate there may be no additions, 
deletions or changes without the author's permission, there is also the 
injunction that his plays must be performed before "fully integrated audiences" 
(aimed chiefly at South Africa, where his one-act, "The Death of Bessie Smith," 
helped break the color line) -- and that there can be no gender changes among 
the characters in "Virginia Woolf." 
</P>
<P>
That had to be added, Albee said, "since that awful nonsense about the play 
having been written for two male couples -- something some movie critic 
(suggested) because he couldn't accept it as an accurate representation of 
heterosexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his problem," Albee winced, "but he made it mine." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Albee is finding "relatively few" difficulties directing the current 
edition of "Virginia Woolf" and blames the cast for this condition ("marvelous 
actors, know their business"). 
</P>
<P>
"The (original) production in '62 was very good," he said. "Alan Schneider did 
a first-rate job directing it. But maybe because the play was so new, so 
shocking -- people were hypocritically shocked by it -- it didn't seem terribly 
funny. It's always struck me as being deadly serious and very funny. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I wanted to direct it in '76 was to bring some of that back 
into focus -- not to soften any of the toughness, but to make it clear that 
this play has a lot of very funny stuff in it. Also, maybe audiences had gotten 
a little less hypocritical by then, less easily shocked, and so they found the 
play both serious and funny." 
</P>
<P>
This time he is also emphatic about one other thing: 
</P>
<P>
"Walter Kerr, when he reviewed the play in 1962, admired it a lot, but said it 
had a hole in its head. He could not accept the invention of the nonexistent 
child. He thought these people were far too bright to have done this. Of 
course, that's the entire point. They're bright enough to have done it. 
</P>
<P>
"And one of the things I'm making terribly clear in this production -- without 
distorting, I don't believe in distorting anything, not even giving undue 
emphasis to, but making it absolutely clear -- is that these people are indeed 
bright enough, inventive enough and mutually supportive enough to be able to 
levitate a metaphor, if you will, of 21 years. That's terribly important. The 
play is about the death of that metaphor." 
</P>
<P>
How did Albee like the film? 
</P>
<P>
"When Warner Bros. approached me about it, I said, 'Who do you plan to put in 
it?' They said, 'Bette Davis and James Mason,' both of whom were exactly the 
right age at that time. So I sold it to them, and then Davis and Mason turned 
into Burton and Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"How did I like it," he growled. "There are rumors that there was a script that 
changed the nonexistent child into a heavily retarded real child -- I'm told 
this, I never saw it -- and I'm also told that when Burton and Taylor and the 
director, Mike Nichols, read (it), they said they wouldn't do the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, the screenplay was rewritten several times and except for those 
those two famous sentences, 'Let's go to the Roadhouse' and 'Let's come back 
from the Roadhouse,' which I did not write and never would write, ever, in any 
context, the words in the movie are pretty much mine. I think I'm lucky it came 
out as well as it did. The thing that bothered me about the film is that it 
isn't funny. I think it has something to do for an audience with the difference 
between a stage and a film experience." 
</P>
<P>
How does it feel to have another English actress playing Martha? 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you best," he said, "by telling you that at an art park, 55 miles 
south of Tokyo called Hakone, I saw a production of 'The Zoo Story,' outdoors, 
in Japanese. Within a few minutes I was seeing and hearing the play in English. 
Does that answer the question? 
</P>

"It makes absolutely no difference. Glenda has none of that reserve the English 
are famous for. She's capable of being broad and a bawd. She doesn't have a 
silly or bizarre English accent. I don't even notice that she's English."

In January, Albee will be staging "Virginia Woolf" at the Alley Theatre in 
Houston where it will play a limited engagement, tour the country for another 
eight weeks and then go to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurred to me," Albee said, "why don't we get very, very good standbys 
here and make them the Houston company?" 
</P>
<P>
And that's what he did. 
</P>
<P>
The standbys are Carol Mayo Jenkins (Martha), Bruce Gray (George), John 
Ottavino (Nick) and Cynthia Bassham (Honey). 
</P>
<P>
"They're first-rate and it saves me a lot of time," he said, grinning like the 
Cheshire Cat. "I thought that was pretty inventive of me."

WHAT BECOMES A HOLLYWOOD LEGEND MOST?; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER YEARS OF TRIBULATION, ELIZABETH TAYLOR FINALLY TAKES ON WILLIAMS' 'SWEET 
BIRD OF YOUTH' ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"I had a great beauty. I say it with pride -- no matter how sad it being gone," 
Elizabeth Taylor says wistfully. The 57-year-old legend picks up a glass of 
bourbon and downs it like a scared monster whose life is over. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is rehearsing a scene from Tennessee Williams' provocative play "Sweet 
Bird of Youth," which NBC will televise at 9 tonight. Directed by Nicolas Roeg, 
the film also stars Mark Harmon, Rip Torn and Valerie Perrine. Hearing the 
actress say the words evokes memories of her own personal history and the 
demons that have plagued her. It is as if she were reflecting on her own life 
of wretched excess, headlines, pain, multiple marriages, booze, drugs and 
bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We always knew it would be Elizabeth Taylor," co-executive producer Peter 
Locke says of the role of Alexandra Del Lago. "After all, her life is a 
Tennessee Williams play." 
</P>
<P>
The film also affords Taylor her best acting challenge in years, reuniting her 
with the playwright with whom some of her best work is associated -- "Cat on a 
Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer," both of which garnered Oscar 
nominations for her. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Taylor lounges on her Bel Air living room sofa dressed in a 
billowing purple caftan. She is surrounded by amethyst crystals -- in obvious 
homage to her famous violet eyes. Above Taylor is a Van Gogh. Nearby is a 
sculpture of a majestic horse entitled "Northern Dancer" -- done by her 
daughter, Liza. She is in a perky mood -- looking overweight and yet strangely, 
inexplicably alluring. 
</P>
<P>
Question: "Sweet Bird of Youth" marks your return to Tennessee Williams. After 
your acclaimed work in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly, Last Summer," 
what do these old and new Williams heroines have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: They (the women characters) are all slightly larger than life and a 
little off the wall -- and a little crazy. Tennessee's women are all a little 
crazy, which makes them infinitely playable. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you grab hold of and attach yourself to their quirky side? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh yes, because it's the most colorful side. Tennessee's women are so rich 
and full-bodied . . . all larger than life. Alexandria is an actress. Well, 
actresses are a little larger than life. (The late) Mike Todd (Taylor's third 
husband) used to say: "An actor is a little less than a man . . . and an 
actress is a little more than a woman." An interesting observation. I'm not 
saying that men are a little less than men at all but actresses are very 
colorful and Alexandra, even if she had been a housewife, would have been 
colorful. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I doubt that she would wield a vacuum cleaner unless it was to hit a badly 
behaved lover. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A: (laughs) True. She's very selfish, self-centered, but I think she is three 
dimensional -- especially when she can get out of her self -- she is very 
single minded about that. She does care. She does have compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But in the end, is she redeemable? 
</P>
<P>
A: (Pondering, then quietly) Barely. But, yes, I think so. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You were close friends with Tennessee Williams but there are conflicting 
press reports as to when you actually met and what the circumstances were. 
</P>
<P>
A: I met him after I had done "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" in New York. I'm not sure 
exactly which year. . . . I was in the hospital with pneumonia and he came to 
see me. It must have been about '57. It was after "Cat" -- no, it wasn't after 
"Cat" -- yes, it was -- must have been . . . now I am confused. It must have 
been after "Cat" but it couldn't have been because Mike (Todd) was killed when 
I was shooting "Cat." Well, I was in the hospital, but I think it was the 
hospital in New York because that's where we lived. Now I am confused. Mike was 
killed in '58. It must have been after. After 1958. Must have been. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How did you get along initially? Do you remember your first impression of 
him? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, we fell about laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why? What did he say to you? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know. But we just hit it off immediately. We got on so well and he 
just made me laugh and I made him laugh. I had pneumonia and Dr. Dana Atchley 
was running the hospital then. He was a wonderful, brilliant doctor and 
everybody was quite in awe of him. He was quite an old, small and diminutive 
man. I remember that he came charging into my room the second that he heard 
that Tennessee was there. He came charging into my room and Tennessee had just 
handed me a cigarette and, or course, I wasn't meant to be smoking, so I made a 
tent with my knee and slipped my hand under the sheet between my knees to form 
this sort of tent to hide it from the doctor. I had just taken one mighty puff 
off of it when he flew into the room and started chatting away with Tennessee. 
Their conversation got further and further along and I kept trying to sit on 
the cigarette and keep it in the confines of the sheet. You realize that this 
doctor would have killed me if he found out. He was capable of throwing me out 
of the hospital. Tennessee kept looking at me and I kept trying to avoid his 
stare and we were cracking up. Dr. Atchley wanted to know everything about 
Tennessee from Tennessee himself. He was a big fan. Finally, the smoke was 
really getting heavy. I didn't have an ashtray and no way of putting the 
cigarette out except on my skin. Finally, he left and we fell about laughing. 
It was just down to a butt. So that's what I remember. A lot of smoke and a lot 
of sweat. That was our first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Time magazine called you the quintessential Tennessee Williams heroine. . . 
. A: They did? When did they do that? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Quite some time ago. I think it still applies. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you. That means I'm highly melodramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is that what it means? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think steamy. Full of drama. I take it as also being poetic. I'm sure they 
didn't mean it kindly. . . .Tennessee's heroines are all fraught. They're on 
the brink of disaster -- some personal disaster. They are infinitely playable. 
They give you something to wrap your lips around. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the actual elements you relate to? 
</P>
<P>
A: Good dialogue. . . . He writes like a poet and it's so wonderful to have 
good words to say because you can relax and be free. I don't know, it just 
gives you a sense of security -- or it does me. . . . You can concentrate on 
feeling the words and let them invade you. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Williams rewrote "Sweet Bird" several times and at one point the central 
figure was actually a man. Was he being partially autobiographical with your 
character? 
</P>
<P>
A: (Shaking her head "no.") They say that about all his plays. Well, he did 
rewrite a lot. So they were saying that he's writing about himself just like 
with (playwright Edward) Albee. They say that all of Albee's parts can be 
interchangeable with a man or a woman. They said "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf?" was made for two men. (She rolls her eyes.) It wasn't. It was written 
for a man and a woman. But people like to say that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is this one of his better works or is it flawed? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't think there is such a thing as his best work. I mean, "Streetcar 
Named Desire" is such a fabulous play. This ("Sweet Bird of Youth") is a 
fabulous play. "Cat" is. "Glass Menagerie." There's just so many. Certainly, I 
think it's one of his best. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You've been talking about doing "Sweet Bird of Youth" for well over a 
decade. Why now? 
</P>
<P>
A: Why not? It just seemed like now is the right time. And it just fell into 
the right place. Even weight wise, it was perfect. I would have had to put on 
weight if it had happened earlier, like I did for "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf?" It just happened at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you know intuitively when the right time is? Obviously, you could have 
</P>
<P>
done it any time. 
</P>
<P>
A: I could have but for some reason I didn't. It's not because I didn't like 
the play. I've been flirting with it for years. I don't know why. Sometimes it 
happens for the right reason. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Nicolas Roeg is an interesting choice for a director. He's never directed 
television before and is known for being eccentric -- and not taking any guff 
from his stars. 
</P>
<P>
A: Nick has a wonderfully macabre sense of humor. He has a jagged blackness in 
his soul. His quirkiness is quite unexpected and that dark element, of course, 
is central to fully understanding Tennessee. I think they complement each other 
so beautifully because Nick's unexpected qualities give it such a burst of 
energy and revival and renewal and rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How did you know from his work in feature films that he would be able to do 
what is, more or less, a classic American play in a medium (television) he's 
never directed in before? 
</P>
<P>
A: I knew not from talking to him -- not specifically that -- but rather 
observing his work . . . he seems a natural for Tennessee. I'm surprised they 
haven't merged before. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you still need a strong director or do you prefer to be left alone to 
your own devices? 
</P>
<P>
A: A strong director does leave you to your devices. A strong director allows 
you to be free and you trust that he's there and he will tell you if you've 
gone too far. A strong director allows you to be much more experimental and 
take greater chances than a director who isn't secure within himself. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Clearly, you must be quite aware of the irony of playing this particular 
role -- she is the ultimate fading movie queen. 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Because I've played so many actresses. People love to write about 
actresses. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But this is the literary world's ultimate "has been" actress. 
</P>
<P>
A: I mean at least once a year I play a "has been" actress and I keep on going, 
so I obviously haven't been has'd yet! (Laughter). I'm a great success as "has 
beens." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Inevitably, comparisons will be drawn between your performance and Geraldine 
Page (who originated the role both on stage and on screen). 
</P>
<P>
A: I haven't seen it (the 1959 film starring Page and Paul Newman). 
Deliberately, because I didn't want to be influenced. She's such a brilliant 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you know you would play the part? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know why I didn't see it when it first came out. I just haven't seen 
it. Probably deliberately didn't see it since '59, consciously because I 
thought one day I'd do it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How was it working with Mark Harmon, a media magnet of another generation? 
</P>
<P>
A: He's terrific. I think he's pulled out a dimension that, as an actor, he may 
not even have been aware of, because he's been playing a certain kind of part. 
In this, he shows a dark side that I don't think people were aware of. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why Mark Harmon over Patrick Swayze and Don Johnson, who were also under 
consideration for the role? 
</P>
<P>
A: Why not? He's perfect. He's all-American. He's the right age. The Sweet Bird 
of Youth is about to say goodby to Chance Wayne. Not Mark, but Chance, because 
of the way he lives and what he has inside: a terrible, dark turbulence eating 
at him. Mark doesn't have that in his own life and yet he portrays it well in 
this, which I think will surprise a lot of people -- the despair that he shows. 
</P>
<P>
Q: (Co-executive producer) Peter Locke says Harmon adds an innocence that 
wasn't inherent in Paul Newman's film performance. 
</P>
<P>
A: I think that's what I mean by all-American, clean-cut. Innocent is good. I 
think that's what attracts the princess to him in the first place, and makes 
her hang in, makes her want to try to save him. If he were just gone, and a 
gigolo and a total user, she wouldn't be bothered. She's seen too many of them, 
being led around in other grand hotels. She thinks he's got a kind of golden 
innocence and sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about beyond acting? What are your personal priorities at this point in 
your life? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't have a set pattern. I take things as they come. Usually with a great 
amount of relish. I just lay back and wait for it to happen. And it usually 
does. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you revealing that you're highly fatalistic or just without a plan for 
the future? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think I'm becoming fatalistic. Too much has happened in my life for me not 
to be fatalistic. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you deal with tabloid reporters going through your garbage and 
invading your children's lives day after day? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are certain things that you can do to insure as much privacy as 
possible, and I do all of them. When they speculate and put false words into 
your mouth, like intimate friends and close sources . . . that's b.s. I know 
it's b.s., the people close to me know it's b.s., and that's all I can do. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you more hurt by attacks on your children? 
</P>
<P>
A: When was the last time I was hurt by tabloids? I don't even remember. 
They're really unimportant to me. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Your son (Michael Wilding) has a small role in "Sweet Bird of Youth." I 
asked him if you ever offered him any advice as an actor and he said something 
to the effect of "Why would she?" But what sort of advice does Elizabeth Taylor 
-- mother -- offer her children? Do you allow them a certain independence? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh God, yes. I regard and respect their privacy as much as I do my own. They 
respect my privacy. I admire my kids as people. They're individuals, with 
individual lives. We're very good friends. I would never drop over their house 
without calling, and they call before they drop over here. It's a mutual 
respect. I think because of that, we're much closer. They know I'm here, and 
they're free to call me whenever they want to. They have their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you care about misconceptions that circulate about you? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. I really don't care. Supposedly I've been on the verge of getting 
married about seven times in the last seven years. There's no point in setting 
the record straight, because if people want to believe that, they'll believe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will you act until you drop? 
</P>
<P>
A: (Big laugh) Till I drop? I don't know when I'm going to drop. I don't know 
when I'm going to retire, either. I don't feel like dropping today. I must be 
active. I'm active outside of working. I must have my own thing to do, and I 
don't mean acting. I'm an active person. (Acting) is probably the thing I know 
best. Certainly it's the thing I've been at the longest. I do enjoy it. Once in 
a while it's fun. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you hear the voice so many actors hear inside themselves burning away 
asking: "Where's my next great part?" 
</P>
<P>
A: I never have been driven in that way, and it's probably evident in my work. 
You don't need to comment on that. I know you're dying to. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the one thing that makes you the most passionate at this stage in 
your life? 
</P>
<P>
A: My work in AIDS. That's the most important thing in my life. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are your goals? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are so many things. I'm the National Chairwoman of AmFAR (The American 
Foundation For AIDS Research). It's an on-going, 24-hour-a-day thing. It 
doesn't let up. It won't let up until there's a cure and people are educated. 
There's still so much stigma left. Where we have helped, aside from giving away 
about $14 million, we've been highly educational, I hope. We are trying. It's 
like fighting city hall, but the government at least is opening an eye now. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is the American government now being more responsible toward making the AIDS 
issue a priority? 
</P>
<P>
A: Responsible? Oh God, yes. The tone in Washington is beginning to change. But 
it won't be enough until there is a cure. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The New York Times once wrote that your highly publicized personal life has 
largely overshadowed your acting accomplishments. Is that a fair assessment and 
if so, does it bother you? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it's true. No, it doesn't bother me. It gives me a chuckle now when 
I hear critics talk about my work in a glowing way, because they sure weren't 
glowing then. To gain respectability in hindsight, I find rather amusing.

THE FALL SEASON: FROM THE OUTER LIMITS TO REAL DOWN TO EARTH PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
WHY SCIENCE FICTION IS ALIVE AND WELL ON TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On Channel 13, a 60-year-old woman is implanted with an alien seedling. When 
she gives birth, the infant is offered up to the Eternal -- a hideous, 
tentacled, pulsating monster straight out of a child's worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Over on Channel 11, a human cop meets, dates and copulates with his neighbor, 
an attractive female scientist from outer space who is endowed with a bald, 
leopard-spotted head and some peculiar erogenous zones. 
</P>
<P>
And on Channel 4, a physicist whose experiments have gone just a little haywire 
can be found leaping back through time to assume the identities of a gorgeous 
woman, an elderly black man, a baby and maybe even a dog. 
</P>
<P>
Science fiction is alive and well -- and outrageous and creepy -- on television 
this season. Aliens from the planet Morthral are vying to take over Earth in 
the second season of Paramount's syndicated "War of the Worlds." An entire 
community of some 250,000 bald-headed "newcomers" from the planet Tenctone are 
intermingling with the human population of Los Angeles in Fox's new series 
"Alien Nation." A perplexed scientist and his mischievous hologram sidekick are 
traveling through time and swapping identities in NBC's "Quantum Leap." And 
with the U.S.S. Enterprise continuing to encounter out-of-this-world adventures 
on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," sci-fi buffs won't have much time for 
their usual dose of Heinlein, Asimov and Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
But while pleasing hard-core sci-fi fans is essential to the success of these 
series, the trick for TV programmers is to make science fiction appealing to 
the mass audience as well. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years, that hasn't been easy. Re-creating the magic of Rod 
Serling's "The Twilight Zone," which wasn't exactly a huge ratings smash itself 
during its six-year run in the early '60s, has been virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Witness NBC. Brandon Tartikoff has guided the network from an almost-dead, 
last-place standing to a commanding first in the prime-time ratings during his 
nearly 10 years as president of the network's entertainment division. His knack 
for ordering and scheduling programs that lasso the loyalties of the Nielsen 
families has been uncanny. Except when it comes to science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Tartikoff's reign, NBC has repeatedly tried and repeatedly failed to 
score with a sci-fi or fantasy series. Neither "Voyagers," "The Powers of 
Matthew Star," "Misfits of Science," "Manimal," "Amazing Stories" nor "Alfred 
Hitchcock Presents" lasted more than two seasons. Even the network's two 
blockbuster sci-fi miniseries, "V" and "Something Is Out There," flopped as 
weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to Brandon with the idea for 'Quantum Leap,' " said Donald Bellisario, 
the show's creator and executive producer, "and he was definitely reticent to 
give it a try. He said, 'science fiction just doesn't work.' Different is OK, 
but science fiction is a four-letter word." 
</P>
<P>
Unabashedly science-fiction shows such as "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and 
"War of the Worlds" have flourished in syndication the last couple of years 
with a smallish (by network standards) audience of hard-core fans. But not a 
single science fiction/fantasy show has clicked on any of the networks since 
"The Incredible Hulk" was canceled in 1982 after a four-year run on CBS and 
"The Bionic Woman" and "The Six Million Dollar Man" enjoyed their modestly 
successful runs on ABC in the mid '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two decades, a period in which sci-fi movies such as the "Star 
Wars" trilogy, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "E.T." were shattering 
box-office records, the networks were churning out such sci-fi flops as 
"Battlestar Galactica," "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century," "Project UFO," "Man 
From Atlantis," "Starman" and "Max Headroom." In the '60s, neither "The 
Invaders" nor "The Time Tunnel" could survive past their first year, "Outer 
Limits" lasted only a year and a half and even the original "Star Trek" wasn't 
anything close to a hit during its three seasons on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the history of the sci-fi and alien form," said Warren 
Littlefield, NBC's executive vice president of prime-time programs. "You go all 
the way back to 'The Invaders' on ABC, which started out great and then faded 
fast. What happens ultimately is the audience asks for a resolution. Is it 
going to be us or them? Who's going to win? They get frustrated sitting week 
after week without getting to the final battle. 
</P>
<P>
"With the miniseries 'Something Is Out There,' it was really scary and we had 
great monsters and the audience responded to that. But when we got into the 
weekly grind of series television, we couldn't deliver that kind of scary stuff 
and great monsters every time." 
</P>
<P>
So why, in the face of so much failure, do the networks keep trying? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as if we walk around here with a sci-fi stamp and say, 'Where is it, 
we've got to have it,' " Littlefield said when pressed about NBC's seemingly 
obsessive search for a science-fiction hit. "But we do walk around looking for 
something that's different. And when you introduce a show like 'Quantum Leap' 
that covers new territory and the audience doesn't out-and-out reject it, 
that's enough for us to say, 'Let's stick with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in deference to that less-than-ringing endorsement of their genre, 
science-fiction TV producers such as Kenneth Johnson, executive producer of 
Fox's "Alien Nation" and formerly the creator of the miniseries "V" and "The 
Incredible Hulk," say the secret to making a science-fiction series with mass 
appeal is "to completely forget about science fiction." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we want to come up with episodes and approaches that you can only see on 
'Alien Nation,' but they have to be driven by character and personal, moral 
issues rather than driven by externals," Johnson said. " 'Battlestar Galactica' 
became mostly shots of space ships flying around and eventually people said, 
'Haven't I seen that already?' And when they turned 'V' into a weekly series, 
it became dependent on action and special effects, whereas the miniseries was 
really an allegory about power and how different people react to it. 
Conversely, the series was all about, 'Well, last week Diana ate a guinea pig, 
what can we have her eat this week?'

"The reason 'Star Trek' has been so successful is that people know that when 
they tune in, it is going to be about something. With science fiction, as with 
everything else, you have to capture their minds more than just dazzle their 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
So while syndicated series such as "War of the Worlds" flaunt their traditional 
sci-fi aliens and monsters, today's network shows downplay their sci-fi 
weirdness. "Alien Nation," Johnson maintained, is not about aliens from outer 
space. It is instead a giant allegory about the integration of an outsider race 
of people into mainstream society. It is an exploration of the prejudice 
encountered by any group -- the Jews and Italians at the turn of the century, 
blacks in the '50s and '60s, the Vietnamese boat people today -- as they search 
for acceptance from the majority. 
</P>
<P>
True, the aliens look strange, they get drunk on "sour milk rather than sour 
mash," they can see in the dark and they have two hearts and some bizarre 
reproductive requirements, but all those physical differences, Johnson insists, 
only make it easier for the audience to swallow strong statements about bigotry 
and the moral necessity of accepting others. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Bellisario, whose show recently began its first full season on NBC 
after an abbreviated, mid-season run earlier this year, has limited the 
time-travel element of "Quantum Leap" to the span of the main character's 
lifetime -- this in an effort to bring as much realism to the show as possible. 
Whereas "The Time Tunnel" in 1966 sent its two scientists to the siege of Troy, 
the battle of Jericho and the home of Marie Antoinette, Bellisario's scientist 
pops in and out of only the last four decades, and 
</P>
<P>
he never gets involved in any major historical events. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes this interesting from week to week is if you get involved with this 
character," Bellisario said, "and it's hard to do that if you're bouncing 
around with the lions and the Christians in ancient Rome. You suspend belief so 
much (in that kind of series) that it becomes an unrealistic kind of show. But 
our audience can identify with the Walter Mitty idea of becoming someone else. 
People think about what it would be like to be a baseball player or an airline 
pilot. We daydream about that." 
</P>
<P>
To enhance the realism of the program and to acclimate the audience to the idea 
of "quantum leaping," the first few shows of the new season will see the 
physicist, played by Scott Bakula, assuming the identity of men around his own 
age. (In the series, the TV audience sees Bakula as himself, but other 
characters see him as the person he has become. When he is reflected in a 
mirror, however, the TV audience also sees him as his new persona.) 
</P>
<P>
"Once everyone understands how this works, then we'll get wilder," Bellisario 
said. "He'll come leaping in as a woman, then as a baby. We may even bring him 
back as a dog, but until we have the audience on our side, it's dangerous to be 
too weird." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "War of the Worlds," is weird, scary and impelled by the 
age-old battle of good against evil -- exactly the kind of thing you think of 
when you hear the words science fiction. In contrast to the network's 
experience with sci-fi, syndication has been the genre's best friend. The 
popularity of the original "Star Trek" series didn't explode until it was 
canceled by NBC and sent off into syndicated reruns. And Paramount's other 
first-run sci-fi/fantasy/horror dramas, "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and 
"Friday the 13th," have found loyal audiences in syndication as well. All three 
shows air weekly on more than 200 stations nationwide, including KCOP Channel 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Network executives contend that science-fiction shows work in syndication 
simply because they can survive with relatively small audiences. "You can be a 
hit with much smaller numbers made up of strictly hard-core fans," Littlefield 
said. " 'Misfits of Science' had a hard-core 19 share and they were upset when 
we canceled it, but it just wasn't enough to sustain the show on the network." 
(Hit network shows generally score at least a 25% share of the audience.) 
</P>
<P>
Frank Kelly, executive vice president of programming for Paramount Television, 
conceded that syndicated shows can "tolerate" smaller audiences. But he added 
that Paramount's three syndicated sci-fi series have succeeded primarily 
because syndication allows for more adventurous content than the networks seem 
to permit with all their research, formulas and preconceived notions about 
"what works and what doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
"They try to get this demographic and cover that audience and apply rules from 
other shows and they think about whether a show fits into their schedule on a 
particular night or hour or week, and that can bog down a good product," Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more freedom in syndication to take risks and push things as far as 
you can push them," said Frank Mancuso Jr., the executive producer of "Friday 
the 13th" and "War of the Worlds." "If you try to fit sci-fi into a network 
box, it won't work. There's a certain homogenization that takes place at the 
network and maybe that's why genre pieces don't work there. They are careful to 
make shows that are certain not to offend anyone, but those shows won't turn 
anyone on either. Genre shows create a rabid following because they are willing 
to go out there in the fringe." 
</P>
<P>
"War of the Worlds," which premieres locally Saturday at 10 p.m., is filmed in 
Toronto and produced on a budget of about $600,000 per episode, significantly 
less than the money spent on a typical network drama. Young men flock to the 
show, and though Paramount was disappointed with the content of the series' 
first season, it still was the fourth-highest rated of all syndicated programs 
among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 -- advertisers' favorite demographic 
group. "Star Trek: The Next Generation" was first, and does as well as or 
better than many network shows. 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of opinion as to whether these syndicated dramas are more 
adventurous than the sci-fi programs that have come and gone on the networks. 
It would be difficult to argue that "Max Headroom," which died a quick death 
two years ago on ABC, was less risky, less innovative, less spectacularly 
cinematic or less out there on the fringe than anything Paramount Television 
has ever tried. What is certain is that all three Paramount series have 
benefited from recognizable titles, which Kelly said induces large chunks of 
the audience to at least sample them once or twice and then stick around if 
they like it. The studio has yet to produce a syndicated sci-fi series that 
isn't named after a famous previous success. Fox's "Alien Nation" is likewise 
based on the Twentieth Century Fox movie of the same name, even though the film 
was far from a box-office smash and the title, according to Johnson, is 
"alienating, sinister" and at cross purposes to drawing a broad network-style 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think from its title that this would be a show for young boys, but 
it's not," Johnson insisted. "Women will click to this show as long as we can 
get them to try it, because our female characters are liberated and not afraid 
to speak their mind. The promotional problem will be getting them past the 
title. People have had it up to here with aliens." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe not. Even if "Alien Nation" and "Quantum Leap" crash with warp speed 
onto the sci-fi TV scrap heap, it is unlikely that the genre will ever become 
the exclusive domain of those rabid hard-core audiences that garner profits for 
shows only in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many times they strike out, network programmers never stop 
swinging for the fences. At least every once in awhile. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll continue to see the networks experiment in this genre," said 
NBC's Littlefield. "You won't see a lot of it, because it requires an 
investment of roughly $15 million just to step up to the plate with a new 
series. And since it costs a fortune, there's a tendency to say, 'Maybe we 
should be up there with a genre that has been doing better.' 
</P>
<P>
"But ultimately the pores get so clogged with the same old thing that you just 
have to try something different. You may go down in a ball of flames, but part 
of being a good programming executive is to believe you can step up there and 
hit a home run with that next at bat."

<TEXT>
<P>
A wedding is about to take place on the military chapel set between Maj. John 
D. (Mac) MacGillis of the U.S. Marine Corps and Polly Cooper. He's a Vietnam 
vet embarking on his first tour of marital duty, she's a liberal-minded 
reporter, widowed with three daughters, ages adorable to adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
But before the vows can be said, a matter of protocol must be settled. All 
activity has ceased while the proper way to hold swords for the traditional 
cutlery canopy through which the couple will exit is discussed. Military buff 
and series star Gerald McRaney finally settles it. "You don't hold the blade 
down toward the honored couple," he says. The rehearsal for the fourth episode 
of CBS' new fall series "Major Dad" can continue; the newlyweds will safely 
exit down the aisle. (The episode airs Monday at 8 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
What can't be so easily settled is what will happen to the couple after they 
leave the chapel. They'll be setting off on a path that statisticians claim 
real people take 1,300 times a day in this country: They'll be forming a 
stepfamily. By the year 1990 (a mere three months off), the Stepfamilies of 
America Assn. predicts that step- and single-parent families will outnumber the 
traditional nuclear form. By the year 2000, stepfamilies are expected to be in 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
If Mac is anything like the 35 million American stepparents before him, he'll 
be faced with emotions and incidents that can frighten, anger and threaten to 
tear this union asunder. If things work out, he'll be rewarded with warm and 
lasting relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Or, he could end up like previous television stepfolks in such cheerful 
fantasies as "The Brady Bunch." If, as the advertising campaign for "Major Dad" 
claims, they're just "looking for a few good laughs," reality may not be 
allowed to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
Television hasn't been totally blind to the changes in American society over 
the past 20 years. It took great delight in exploiting the phenomenon of 
single-parent households with such '80s hits as "Who's the Boss?," "Kate &amp; 
Allie," "My Two Dads" and "Full House." But these tended to avoid the messiness 
of real life. Ex-spouses were conveniently dead or forgotten and children 
weren't troubled by the specter of a stepparent. Indeed, Mom or Dad were rarely 
allowed to bring their dates indoors . . . unless they happened to be living 
under the same roof, as was the case of the hired help in "Who's the Boss?" 
Remarriages usually didn't work, ratings or storywise: When Allie landed a man 
after five years of living with Kate, he was transferred to a job in another 
city -- in what must be a common stepchild fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
There were also some ill-fated attempts at portraying stepfamilies during this 
period. Among them was NBC's 1983 mid-season series, "The Family Tree," which 
starred Ann Archer and Frank Converse in a tense, hourlong family drama of a 
couple's efforts to bring together two sets of kids. Possibly too real for its 
time, it was soon axed. That fall, ABC had "It's Not Easy." The half-hour 
sitcom sought humor in two remarried exes living across the street from each 
other and sharing custody of a pair of kids. The premise proved as impossible 
as it might have been in real life and lasted just five episodes. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the networks have introduced a new community of prime-time 
stepfamilies. Sunday nights, ABC's "Life Goes On," about a family coping with a 
Down's syndrome child, includes a daughter from the husband's first marriage. 
NBC is running two limited series featuring stepfamilies on its Sunday night 
"Magical World of Disney" hour. In "Parent Trap," Hayley Mills (who as a 
teen-ager in the 1961 original "The Parent Trap" played a set of twins scheming 
to get their divorced parents back together) will marry the widowed father of 
triplets. Referred to by industry insiders as "The Brady Bunch in Hell," "A 
Brand New Life" is an hourlong drama-comedy that Perry Simon, NBC's senior vice 
president of series programs, says will "capture the bitter as well as the 
sweet" of stepfamily life. Barbara Eden plays a divorced waitress and mother of 
three who marries Don Murray, a widowed attorney and father of three. 
</P>
<P>
Monday nights on CBS will be the stepfamily hour as "Major Dad" is followed at 
8:30 by "The People Next Door." This half-hour sitcom features a widowed 
cartoonist with two kids, a new wife and an imagination with a life all its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Among returning shows, "The Cosby Show" on NBC has Lisa Bonet rejoining the 
Huxtable fold with a new husband and a 3-year-old stepdaughter. J.R. Ewing's 
new bride from last season continues as stepmother to his son on "Dallas," and 
among CBS' mid-season replacements is "His &amp; Hers," about a 
husband-and-wife marriage counseling team who have custody of his teen-age son 
from a previous union and hopes of starting their own family. 
</P>
<P>
So is television ready to tackle the truths of this patched-together family 
form? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
"TV doesn't want to do stepfamilies," says Earl Pomerantz, co-executive 
producer of "Major Dad." "It's too complicated. Mom and Dad is easier." 
</P>
<P>
Pomerantz, a former producer of "The Cosby Show," drew on his own experiences 
as a stepfather for the 1988 mid-season series "Family Man." It was critically 
well received, but it was bounced from the schedule for the more traditional 
family fare of "The Ten of Us," a "Growing Pains" spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for TV, especially comedy, to do stepparents and do it funny," 
Pomerantz says. "A buffoon dad is easy. What is a stepdad? They're not the most 
winning characters. . . . A divorced mother marries another guy, she's not 
getting back together with Dad. I don't know what's funny about that." 
</P>
<P>
"Major Dad" did not begin life as a stepfamily show. When CBS committed to 
doing a sitcom with "Simon &amp; Simon" star McRaney, he was pitched as a 
widowed Marine trying to cope with raising a family alone. The network added 
its spin by making the household totally female, to contrast with his all-male 
work environment. And rather than making him a widower, co-executive producer 
Richard C. Okie says, they paired him with a widow, "so there's a live, adult 
relationship happening along with the parenting." 
</P>
<P>
Television, like many stepfamilies, seems to have the most trouble dealing with 
the ex-spouses. "Major Dad" is no exception. Okie's instinct and Pomerantz's 
personal experiences led them to kill off the stepchildren's biological father. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was cleaner," Okie says. "If you add a father, where does he 
live, when does he come in and what's his relationship with the family? There's 
competition with Mac and already we're into a whole other potentially heavy and 
less humorous area." 
</P>
<P>
They have discovered a payload of humor in the power that Polly's three girls 
have over Mac, a common situation between stepparent and child. 
</P>
<P>
"They jerk his chain," Okie says. "(The kids) realize they have the reins here 
and they enjoy it. I know it happens in stepfamilies. There are cards that 
stepkids can play." 
</P>
<P>
And while many stepfamilies would hope for harmony as soon as possible, "Major 
Dad" will benefit, its creators believe, by keeping Mac and the children at a 
distance for at least the first year. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out with characters who are at A and Z," Okie says, "and we don't 
want them to rush to the middle of the alphabet too fast." Mac may melt to the 
point of adopting his charges, Okie assures, but it probably won't be until at 
least next season. 
</P>
<P>
NBC decided to give its "A Brand New Life" stepfamily a full hour in which to 
explore the laughter and the tears. "An hour was better suited to the more 
complicated situation a stepfamily poses," Perry Simon says. 
</P>
<P>
The premise is that of a working-class waitress and divorced mother of three, 
played by Eden, who marries a successful lawyer and widowed father of three, 
played by Murray. On the surface, it might sound familiar, producer-writer 
Chris Carter acknowledges, but "it's as far as you can get from 'The Brady 
Bunch.' 'The Brady Bunch' had a laugh track, it could be silly, sweet, 
schmaltzy, smarmy. It was a product of its time. This show will be a product of 
its time." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, there will be stress aplenty. The kids will have clashing values and 
territorial battles, while the new wife dukes it out with the old housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
The new wife's former husband will live nearby, occasionally invading their 
lives. When they decide to put her teen-age daughter in private school, the 
biological dad will show up to protest. Things probably won't get much 
crankier, for now. "I would love to explore the more tragic parts of a blended 
family," Carter says. "It's something you have to build an audience for." 
Because his immediate goal is to have audiences and the network begging for 
more episodes, he feels "the time is not right to test some of those darker 
waters." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Seibt, a therapist and instructor specializing in stepfamilies at the 
California Family Studies Center in North Hollywood, fears television will 
continue to take the easy way out in confronting step issues. "If people get 
the impression that 'these people are able to work it out, then why can't we? 
We must be failures,' there's a danger they'll feel pressure to do better 
rather than look realistically at their own situation." 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is, it's a struggle, and you don't always succeed," Seibt adds. 
The statistics are indeed discouraging: 60% of stepfamilies fail, with 49% 
divorcing within the first four years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Seibt is encouraged by the potential benefit to stepchildren when they 
see families like their own on television. "It helps them feel they're not so 
out of place," Seibt says, "(that) being in this family is normal." 
</P>
<P>
"When I formed my stepfamily 15 years ago, I naively said, 'You'll love this; 
it will be just like 'The Brady Bunch,' " recalls Mala Burt, a licensed 
clinical social worker and president of the Stepfamilies of America Assn. "Back 
then, there wasn't much information for stepfamilies. (My husband and I) just 
loved each other and we thought that everything was going to be wonderful -- to 
the point of denying any potential trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Television was doing the same. "Most of the shows left the impression that you 
could solve issues in 20-30 minutes," Burt says. "The realities were glossed 
over. There were no ex-spouses in 'The Brady Bunch.' Everyone called the 
parents Mom and Dad, so the real relationships were never acknowledged. There 
were no good role models for stepfamilies showing how to deal with previous 
families. It was unrealistic both for kids and adults." 
</P>
<P>
When Donald Reiker and his writing partner and real-life spouse, Patricia 
Jones, wanted to add more "heat" to the concept for "His &amp; Hers," a 
half-hour comedy about a husband-and-wife marriage-counseling team, they gave 
the husband (played by Martin Mull) a previous marriage and custody of one of 
his two kids. They also gave him a wisecracking ex-wife. Taking the place of 
the more typical sitcom fixture -- the mildly irritating next-door neighbor -- 
she would hang around the couple's house and compare notes with the new missus. 
</P>
<P>
When CBS tested the show, however, audiences found the character confusing and 
unrealistic. The writers had hoped to portray -- particularly among characters 
who are mental-health professionals -- a healthy divorce situation. "People had 
a great deal of trouble accepting the fact the new wife could be friendly with 
the ex-wife," Jones says. "We were shocked." They agreed with CBS, however, to 
write the character out. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's an area that should be tapped," Reiker adds. "If we had the 
courage to stay with it, audiences might have loved it." 
</P>
<P>
Earl Pomerantz says he'll continue to try to slip some of life's truths into 
his shows where he can, but not at the expense of entertainment. And while 
stepfamilies may soon be an audience majority, he doesn't believe they want to 
see a mirror of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Television still likes 'ALF,' " he says, "things from another planet that are 
cute and cuddly. They don't want to see something with built-in dark clouds."

'DO YOU HAVE A TABLE FOR TWO AT 8?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The restaurant business, people in the business will tell you, is terrible. 
They blame it on the stock market, on the baby boom, on the changes in the tax 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
But our almost-annual survey tells a different story. Every year or so we sit 
down at 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon and call restaurants all over town asking 
for a table for two at 8 that night. 
</P>
<P>
The first time we did it we discovered that tables were available in all the 
top of the line expensive restaurants while the hip new grills and cafes simply 
laughed at the notion that a table might be available on such short notice. A 
year and a half ago things were different: At 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon 
not a single restaurant in town turned us down. While many did not have a table 
at 8, most were able to accommodate us between 7:30 and 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed. These days if you want to make last minute plans for the 
weekend, you'd best be prepared for dinner at 6 or 10, because that's when a 
lot of local restaurants are going to ask you to eat. If you've got your eye on 
Saturday, things get even worse: only a quarter of the restaurants we called on 
Friday were able to offer us a Saturday night table at a reasonable hour. 
</P>
<P>
Other than reaffirming the fact that Los Angeles loves a new restaurant (and 
especially a new and reasonable restaurant), few patterns emerged. The top of 
the line expensive restaurants are doing well, old favorites are doing well, 
new favorites are thriving. Los Angeles restaurants, in fact, are cooking.

"It's something you need -- the biggest advertisement you'll ever get. But you 
only get it once and you've got to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Duplex chef/owner Mark Carter 
</P>
<P>
An empty restaurant is the single most feared disaster of every restaurateur. 
But the alternative -- customers eager, even desperate to eat your food -- can 
cripple newly opened restaurants, too. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant reviews pack restaurants, but a spread in a fashion magazine or a 
blurb in a tip sheet often has the same effect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful, but it's a nightmare, too," Cha Cha Cha's Toribio Prado said 
recently. Shortly after it opened four years ago, the tiny Caribbean restaurant 
was featured in three different articles within four days. "We'd been serving 
about 20 or 30 dinners a night, and suddenly that Saturday, we were up to 180. 
It was so crazy that night -- we only had one waiter, so Mario (Tamayo, Prado's 
former partner in the restaurant) had to run around serving the food. I 
remember he was wearing a white suit -- by the end of the night his suit was 
gray. And we'd run out of food for the following day." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Grill in Brentwood was so overwhelmed by crowds during its first 
weeks in business it had to stop serving breakfast. Customers had started 
lining up at 6 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
And the phenomenon isn't new: Valentino was hit hard and fast by crowds 
responding to a small mention in The Times years ago which praised Piero 
Selvaggio's establishment. "You're talking to someone who literally went from 
11 dinners on Saturday night, Dec. 23, 1972," Selvaggio says, "to 110 dinners 
on Dec. 25." 
</P>
<P>
The difference between Valentino and Cha Cha Cha is a matter of timing. When 
Cha Cha Cha suddenly became hot, it had been open just a few weeks. Valentino 
had been open several months. The extra time gave Valentino's staff the 
seasoning it needed to handle the unexpected deluge of new customers without 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"The process of opening a restaurant these days is rather strange," Trattoria 
Angeli co-owner John Strobel says. "You hire a lot of people who've never 
worked together before and put them to work on equipment that may be totally 
unfamiliar to them. Waiters have to learn to place orders, the kitchen staff 
has to get to know each other's quirks, and the front door has to learn how to 
book the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, let's say, three or four weeks after you open, you get a review -- it 
doesn't even have to be a good review -- suddenly, you're doing 50% more 
business and nobody's ready for it. And so instead of working on developing a 
strong staff, you're working on dealing with the volume of people walking in 
the door. The staff, instead of continuing to improve, actually goes downhill. 
They get confused, they get anxious, they get overworked and tired. And you can 
never recover from that." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's more difficult than ever," Selvaggio says. "There's an explosion, or 
exaggeration of restaurants. Most are somehow hyped out from the beginning, 
because of a famous chef, because a famous group of investors -- these days, a 
good review might be the icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of restaurants, aware of the problems crowds cause, try to combat the 
anticipated chaos with a tactical counterassault. They're rarely successful. 
</P>
<P>
Joachim and Christine Splichal, for instance, tried to maintain control over 
their new restaurant, Patina, by underbooking. But when a tiny, 200-word story 
in The Times announced the restaurant's opening, crowds clamored to be fed as 
at every other hot restaurant. Long waits for tables and short tempers 
resulted. "We fill the restaurant to capacity, but the phone keeps ringing off 
the hook," Christine said at the time. "You know, it's the hardest thing in the 
world to tell someone: 'No, you can't come to my restaurant.' " 
</P>
<P>
Certain restaurant staffers (usually not owners) don't exactly torture 
themselves over dispensing rejection. When Santa Monica's DC 3 had been open 
just two weeks, a caller seeking a reservation for the following week was 
greeted with hysterical laughter, followed by a "You've got to be kidding!" 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I've learned about opening restaurants," says Trattoria Angeli's 
Strobel, "is that they never turn out the way you think they're going to before 
you open, never. No matter how much you prepare and research," Strobel says. "I 
think it takes a restaurant a good year and a half to come into its own. 
Unfortunately, a lot of restaurants aren't given that much time."

Britain's opposition Labor Party pulled well ahead of Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher's Conservatives in opinion polls published in London. Newspaper 
surveys showed Labor, often divided and demoralized during a decade in 
opposition, between 5 and 12 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives. 
Labor leader Neil Kinnock hopes to rally his party for a general election due 
by mid-1992 with an address Tuesday at the party's annual conference in 
Brighton. A poll by the Mail newspaper gave Labor 46% support to 34% for the 
Conservatives. A Sunday Times poll showed Labor with 43% support, 5 percentage 
points ahead of the Conservatives.

NASA named astronaut crews for five space shuttle missions scheduled for 1990 
and 1991, including the first black woman selected for space flight. Dr. Mae C. 
Jemison, 32, a physician, was assigned as a mission specialist to a June, 1991, 
flight aboard the shuttle Discovery. The mission is to conduct life sciences 
and materials processing experiments. She was working with Cigna Health Plans 
of California and as a general practitioner in Los Angeles when selected for 
the astronaut program in 1985.

in a jetliner restroom then abandoned her newborn infant in a wastebasket, has 
been delayed because she is expecting again. LoCasto, 27, of Staten Island, was 
scheduled to begin serving time in Redwood City on Oct. 14 after she pleaded no 
contest earlier this year to child endangerment. She was on a flight from 
Newark, N.J., to San Francisco in 1988 when she went into labor and delivered a 
baby girl, Alyssa, in a DC-10 restroom. She wrapped the infant in paper towels 
and abandoned her in a waste basket beneath the sink, where it was later 
discovered by a cleaning crew. LoCasto, who has two older daughters, ages 8 and 
2, is expecting her fourth child at the end of October, after which she will 
begin serving her sentence.

The International Atomic Energy Agency's policy-setting body, in a move opposed 
by the United States and other Western members, passed a resolution denouncing 
Israel's nuclear policies as a threat to peace and security. The resolution, 
sponsored by 14 states including Iraq, Libya and Saudi Arabia, was adopted on 
the last day of the agency's annual conference in Vienna. The vote was 47 in 
favor and 28 against, with 12 abstentions. It is widely believed that Israel 
has the capability of producing nuclear weapons, but there is disagreement on 
whether it has done so.

The bodies of 3,311 World War II Polish officers and soldiers were found in 
five mass graves in the Lithuanian village of Kalety, Polish television 
reported. The report quoted people who claimed to be witnesses as saying the 
victims were shot by Soviet troops. It did not say how or when the graves were 
discovered. More than 15,000 Polish officers were interned in three Soviet 
camps in the Ukraine during World War II and subsequently disappeared. In 1943, 
Nazi Germany, which overran Soviet territory, announced the discovery of a mass 
grave of 4,250 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest, near Smolensk in the 
Ukraine.

North Carolina has refused the Ku Klux Klan permission to join an 
Adopt-a-Highway cleanup program that would have allowed the group to post its 
name on signs along a stretch of road running through a black neighborhood. 
Under the program, the state puts up eye-catching, green-and-white road signs 
naming the group or business that has pledged to clean the adopted stretch of 
road four times a year. The klan asked for a 3.4-mile stretch of road on U.S. 
158 in Rockingham County about 100 miles from Raleigh through a predominantly 
black neighborhood.

A DRIVING PASSION FOR LIFE STYLE

<TEXT>
<P>
The bets are down and the cars are braced for the race. 
</P>
<P>
A 1967 El Camino and a 1955 Chevrolet rock and roar, enveloped in a hellish fog 
of exhaust and smoke from the furious rotation of big slick tires burned sticky 
for better traction. Out of the darkness appears an elfin girl with flashing 
blond hair waving a red bandanna. Two drivers named Danny and "Seaweed" are 
off, reaching speeds of more than 100 m.p.h. on a well-traveled street in the 
middle of the nation's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
It is dangerous and illegal and certainly cause for wonder: Racing cars in a 
city where the workaday commuter is lucky to average 20 m.p.h., where the 
combustion engine is becoming the modern equivalent of Typhoid Mary. The street 
racing, which goes on in half a dozen places around town, is indicative of a 
condition that has afflicted Southern Californians since they abandoned one of 
the best public transit systems in the world in favor of Henry Ford's $300 
Model T and the Sunday drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perils Haven't Cooled Passion 
</P>
<P>
Smog, gridlock, freeway shooters, insurance rates and permit parking may cause 
people to leave town for Seattle or San Luis Obispo. But the perils of driving, 
so far, have not been enough to cool Southern California's passion for the 
automobile. We keep on showing them, racing them and customizing them. We keep 
on setting design standards and buying cars in greater quantity and diversity 
than anywhere else in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, it staggers my imagination that people are still so crazy about 
their cars," said Gerald P. Hirshberg, vice president of Nissan's U.S. design 
headquarters near San Diego. "You watch them crawling along the freeway. They 
could walk faster. Then, you look at their cars, clean, gleaming, polished 
objects of love. It's hard to think of Californians without them." 
</P>
<P>
As with movies and earthquakes, car culture is part of the dreamscape, the 
mixture of history and fantasy, attraction and repulsion that gives the region 
its peculiar identity. Southern California has been shaped by cars, and cars 
have been shaped by Southern California. Freeways, McDonald's, Sunset Strip, 
valet parking, cruising, car phones, drive-by homicides -- all defining 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy years ago, the automobile gave people the freedom to live where they 
wanted, providing Los Angeles with its expansive profile. Today, with smog 
foreshadowing a perpetual, noxious twilight, an anti-car culture threatens to 
recast the region, as people are required to drive less and urged to reconsid 
er where they live and how they get to work. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the romance of the road goes on: 
</P>
<P>
Joan Koravos and Larry Guzzetta, a middle-aged El Toro couple who met while 
driving home on the Santa Ana Freeway, returned to the freeway last month and 
got married in a stretch limousine. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my friends to forget the singles bars," Koravos said. "If you're 
looking for the right person, just drive the freeways and smile." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9% Sales Increase Seen 
</P>
<P>
Longo Toyota of El Monte recently predicted a 9% net gain in sales, a sign that 
the dealer is on the way to leading the nation in new car and truck sales for 
the 11th year in a row. Founder Dominic Longo attributed the success, in part, 
to a company code of discipline that forbids salesmen from swearing, smoking, 
chewing gum, wearing loud shirts or sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
Takashi Oka, a Nissan design executive, traveled from Tokyo to Laguna Niguel in 
Orange County to live with a family in the hope of designing a new luxury car 
that is perfectly tuned to the wants of the American consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Worthington, perhaps the most enduring symbol of the Southern California 
car market, has taken the car culture on the road, extending his empire of Ford 
and Dodge dealerships -- along with his "aw, shucks" stage presence and 
menagerie of animals, all named Spot -- from Long Beach to Texas to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boon to Economy Since 1930 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary work is under way to double-deck the Harbor Freeway, and plans are 
under study to turn the Los Angeles Riverbed into a commuter expressway. 
</P>
<P>
Cars were fueling the Southern California economy as early as 1930, when the 
region already had more automobiles per capita than anywhere else in the world. 
Today, Los Angeles and Orange counties alone account for 13% of all new car and 
truck sales in the country. There are more dealers and designers here, more 
varieties of automobiles and more accessories bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Auto market analysts J. D. Power and Associates once noted that if Southern 
California were a state it would rank first in new car and truck sales. 
</P>
<P>
When the auto age was in its infancy, Southern California was a market in 
search of the automobile. The region was settled largely by comfortably fixed 
emigres from the East and Midwest who could afford cars and who wanted to live 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Track to Suburbs 
</P>
<P>
The city's ambitious rail network, built during the first decade of this 
century with profits from the sale of adjacent real estate, provided the 
original impetus for suburban sprawl. But in the coming years the car allowed 
people to settle in the spaces between the rail lines and sped the development 
of more remote corners, such as the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s residents rejected a proposed 110-mile system of subway and 
elevated trains in favor of a comprehensive street-expansion program, including 
the city's first grade-separated parkway, which was to connect Pasadena with 
downtown and become the precursor of the city's first freeway. In 1937, the 
Southern California freeway system was proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The automobile influenced Southern California culture -- or, rather, created a 
culture of its own -- in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence on Architecture 
</P>
<P>
It helped inspire the region's most distinctive architecture from Bullock's 
Wilshire with its porte- cochere facing the parking lot, to the original 
McDonald's, to the nation's first drive-in church (the early version of today's 
Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove), to the freeways' spiraling interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Architectural historian Thomas Hines has written that, after Frank Lloyd 
Wright, Henry Ford may have been the most important influence on Southern 
California architects. One of those architects was Richard Neutra, who designed 
the Garden Grove church and who began building houses in Los Angeles during the 
1920s and 1930s when the city's infatuation with the automobile was at full 
throttle. 
</P>
<P>
Neutra built folding bus doors into his own Los Angeles home. He paid homage to 
Ford in another house by using Model T headlights as stairway light fixtures. 
Streamlined, efficient and idiosyncratic, Neutra's designs reflected the spirit 
of the burgeoning auto age in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carport Replaced Garage 
</P>
<P>
The car also changed the way people used their homes. The detached garage, 
often a shed at the rear of the property, was replaced by the carport, and the 
carport leading into the kitchen began to usurp the role of the front door. By 
the 1930s, the spacious front porch, the vestibule and the parlor, all symbols 
of a gracious and formal way of life, were becoming obsolete as Wright, Neutra 
and others introduced homeowners to a more informal, suburban way of life. 
</P>
<P>
But, from the days of the Model T to the era of the catalytic converter, there 
was a dark side to car culture. 
</P>
<P>
In his recent book, "The Automobile Age," James J. Flink wrote that by the 
early 1920s, local authorities were worried that the automobile was undermining 
public morals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Car Theft in 1920s 
</P>
<P>
Flink, an Irvine-based auto historian, noted that car theft emerged in the 
1920s as the state's most profitable crime and that, by the end of the decade, 
35% of the inmates of one state reform school were serving time for stealing 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
A report by a Los Angeles County police official in the 1920s made note of 
"numerous complaints of night riders who park their automobiles along country 
boulevards and indulge in orgies," while the police chief of Pasadena 
complained of having to use most of his squad cars to deal with "the astounding 
number of couple lovers" parked along dark streets. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the city's freeway system was under construction in the early 
1940s that people began to suspect a connection between the thickening brown 
haze and the sickly aspect of the orange crop. The term "smog" was coined and, 
for several years, officials blamed it on refineries and on atmospheric 
inversion. There was a proposal to break up the inversion by blowing cold air 
through it from helicopters, and another scheme to suck out the smog with giant 
fans or "smoqueducts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Automobile Defended 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in 1949, Louis McCabe, Los Angeles' first smog commissioner, warned 
against "the folklore" that would primarily blame the automobile for air 
pollution, according to The Atlantic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of a century passed before state officials required auto 
makers to install catalytic converters to reduce the hydrocarbon emissions that 
with sunlight create ozone, the ingredient in smog most dangerous to plant and 
human life. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to argue that the influence of cars on the region has been 
exaggerated. There is only one auto assembly plant in Southern California -- a 
General Motors operation in Van Nuys. Drag racing was born on the back roads of 
the Appalachian South. The first drive-in restaurant was built in New Jersey, 
the first drive-in mortuary in Atlanta. Freeways did not define the city's 
boundaries. They were built in the 1940s long after the trolley tracks formed 
the grid upon which much of the city was developed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Conspiracy Theory 
</P>
<P>
There is also the theory that the automobile culture was forced on a city that 
had been happily dependent on a vast and efficient system of public transport. 
According to this theory, the city's rail transit system fell victim to a 
conspiracy by General Motors, Standard Oil of California and Firestone Tire 
&amp; Rubber to buy up and ultimately dismantle the city's streetcar lines. 
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy theory is still hotly argued, but is countered with evidence 
that the public began forsaking the streetcars long before GM and its partners 
took apart the Pacific Electric Co. in the 1950s. James Flink and other 
transportation scholars point out that Pacific Electric was losing money and 
patronage as early as 1930. They blame the streetcar's fading popularity on 
rising fares, poor maintenance and society's love affair with the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killed by Private Car 
</P>
<P>
"The culprit was the . . . private passenger car, which in the 1950s began 
making dramatic inroads into ridership on all modes of public transit," Flink 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1920s, when a designer named Harley Earl worked from modeling 
clay molds to design $25,000 custom cars for celebrities such as Fatty Arbuckle 
and Tom Mix -- Mix's car had a saddle mounted on the hood -- Southern 
California has been a laboratory for automotive style. 
</P>
<P>
The auto industry routinely speaks of the "California car." Years ago, it was 
the "woody." Later came the van conversion, the compact pickup and the modular 
compact, like the Nissan Pulsar, with interchangeable body parts, and, this 
year, the two-seater Mazda Miata convertible. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being designed in Southern California, the California car, when it 
catches on, seems to make a statement about this part of the country that 
appeals to people elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lure of the Open Road 
</P>
<P>
"It's the appeal of the open road, the wind in your teeth, tooling along 
Highway 1," said Mark Jordan, one of the Miata's designers. "All that sense of 
old-fashioned freedom and adventure boiled down into a single automobile. 
That's . . . our notion of the California car." 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, simply identifying a car with Southern California can be good for 
business. For example, said Hirshberg: "There is a special, sporty version of 
the Pulsar sold in Japan called the "LA Version" which is always advertised 
with a surfboard in the back." 
</P>
<P>
In November, Nissan plans to unveil Infiniti, a car that grows out of design 
executive Takashi Oka's experience living with a Southern California family. 
</P>
<P>
Oka spent several weeks living in Laguna Niguel with what Nissan hoped would be 
a typical American upper-middle-class family at work and play, said Laura Fox, 
a Nissan publicist. Fox said that after exposure to the family's political 
views (conservative), its work habits, shopping and leisure activities, Oka 
came away convinced that what the American family needed was an antidote for 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Pursuit of Comfort 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's answer is a $38,000 luxury car in which the pursuit of comfort assumed 
the aura of a spiritual quest. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most noticeable things about the car is the size of the door 
handles," she said. "They are very large. Mr. Oka noticed that the door handles 
of American homes are quite large, and he wanted to make the statement that 
entering the car was like entering the home. He also developed a concept called 
unified tactile sense. He wanted every piece of leather in the car to come from 
the same cowhide because it is more soothing to the driver if everything feels 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while," Fox said, "the word Zenlike was being used a lot in talking 
about the Infiniti." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risks in Defining Taste 
</P>
<P>
Nissan executives have expressed confidence in the Infiniti's nationwide 
appeal, although they admit that there is always a slight risk in tailoring a 
car to suit Southern California tastes. When it comes to matters Zenlike, this 
part of the country has been known to drive to the sound of a different mantra. 
</P>
<P>
Although designers create their versions of the California car, it never seems 
quite enough to their principal audience. Southern Californians have been 
tinkering with cars since the inventive Earl created the mother-in-law seat 
(over the right rear fender). 
</P>
<P>
Grey Baskerville, senior editor of Hot Rod magazine, estimates that 20% of the 
$1 billion spent each year around the country on specialty auto parts -- from 
hood scoops to wire wheels to stereo systems -- is spent in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pomona Swap Meet 
</P>
<P>
The mecca for this market is the Pomona swap meet, the weekend brainchild of 
postal worker and antique-car collector George Cross. It is held seven Sundays 
a year on a dusty, often sweltering stretch of midway at the Los Angeles County 
fairgrounds, where it is not unusual for 25,000 to 30,000 people to gather. 
</P>
<P>
So many people showed up at the last meet that Cross was forced to close the 
gates by 9:30 a.m. People come from as far away as Florida to buy and sell 
parts and to display their cars in a slow-moving promenade of restored Model 
As, '60s muscle cars, Baja Bugs and customized Corvettes. 
</P>
<P>
Cross' biggest headache these days is limiting what one of his assistants 
referred to as the "Tupperware crowd" to make room for all of the auto 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No More Frying Pans 
</P>
<P>
"When we started 14 years ago, we'd get maybe 150 people. A lot of them would 
be selling frying pans, hoses, jewelry, you name it. Now, I just don't have the 
space," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of miles from most of the nation's major population centers, Los 
Angeles was never destined to rival Detroit in the manufacture of motor 
vehicles. Nevertheless, cars are big business here. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's leading Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Acura, Mercedes, BMW, Buick and 
Jeep-Eagle dealers are in Los Angeles and Orange counties, and the automobile 
is an important underpinning of the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
The ports here unload up to 1 million cars a year, taking in $20 million in the 
process and employing more than 200,000 people to handle the imports. In Los 
Angeles, 10% of the city's taxable transactions involve cars, trucks and 
related supplies, according J. D. Power and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Supports El Monte 
</P>
<P>
"The automobile business is our single most important source of revenue. We 
have $10 million in reserves and auto tax revenues are a large component of 
that," said Gregory Korduner, administrative officer of El Monte, a town of 
95,000 and the home of Longo Toyota. Competition for auto dealers led some 
municipalities to offer to write down the cost of land, to make interest-free 
construction loans and to ease zoning restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, dealers describe this market as the nation's toughest. Jack 
Brewer, a Porsche Audi dealer, with outlets in both San Diego and Denver, says 
that to stay competitive in this market he has spent money and taken risks he 
wouldn't consider in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring an interior designer who specialized in hotels and resorts, Brewer said 
he spent $5 million creating a high-fashion dealership complete with a white 
floored repair shop built to look like a hospital operating room. 
</P>
<P>
"In Colorado," Brewer said, "I'd never think about same-day delivery of a car. 
Here, it's the car now even before the credit's been approved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dramatic Changes Expected 
</P>
<P>
Amid the Gold Rush aura that envelops the Southern California auto economy, 
many people in the business acknowledge that there must be dramatic changes in 
the vehicles we drive and in the ways we drive them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are limits to the mobility and the freedom that the car gave us, and 
those limits are closing in," said Hirshberg at Nissan. "The mood has swung 
from exhilaration to frustration to anger. Obviously, those of us in the 
business have got to grapple with the problems." 
</P>
<P>
Some changes already are being contemplated. In its 20-year master plan, the 
regional Air Quality Management District has recommended banning drive-through 
services, from banks to burger stands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auto Habit Under Attack 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, UCLA invited a dozen of the state's most distinguished 
transportation scholars to a symposium on the automobile. They talked about 
breaking the auto habit by putting an end to inexpensive parking, encouraging 
solo drivers to share their car with people who can't afford to own 
automobiles, improving public transit and building houses close to offices. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Wachs, the professor of urban planning who organized the event, said 
about 160 people attended the symposium. 
</P>
<P>
It's about the same number of people who show up at the Carl's Jr. drive-in at 
Sepulveda and Venice in West L.A. on Friday nights to show off their 400-plus 
cubic inch "big block" engines, their $2,000 antique wheels or their trunk 
loads of hydraulic equipment -- $3,000 worth of pumps and batteries per car -- 
that can kick a 1983 full-size Pontiac a foot in the air from a dead stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horsepower Fuels Talk 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much talk of fuel efficiency or ride-sharing or parking bans at 
Carl's. There, the conversation runs to horsepower, differential and the 
relative merits of nitrous oxide, a power booster than can give a street racer 
an additional 100 horses under the hood -- if he can stomach the risk of engine 
disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's is the weekend haunt of Danny Valdez, a 20-year-old mechanic who owns a 
quick El Camino. Like his friends, like the thousands of young people who 
gather at drive-ins around the region, Danny is hooked on cars in a way that 
the transportation scholars may not fully appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
"I race cars because it's dangerous," he said on a recent Friday, "and because 
I'd rather spend money on a car than waste it on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
As Danny talked amid the sounds of revved engines, the boom of oversize car 
speakers and the squeal of slick tires, an old adversary approached him and 
quietly challenged him to a race. Danny thought it over, complained he was 
having carburetor trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, man. It's just not running too good." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man," the other fellow persisted. "I'll give you the move (a head start). 
I'll even let my girlfriend drive." 
</P>
<P>
That did it. The ultimate taunt. Danny nodded, and the two men headed for their 
cars.

TALKS ON PEACE IN LEBANON OPEN IN SAUDI RESORT 
</P>

<P>
The Lebanese Parliament, divided and decimated by 14 years of civil war, 
unofficially convened for the first time in more than a year Saturday with a 
vow to "show that the Lebanese want to live together." 
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese people look at this as a turning point," Parliament Speaker 
Hussein Husseini said at the beginning of talks on a proposed "national 
reconciliation charter" to restructure the government, elect a new president 
and end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"Our success opens the way for peace. Our failure opens the way to hell and 
chaos. We have to succeed," Husseini declared. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two of the Parliament's 73 surviving members arrived for talks in this 
resort community perched in the mountains above the smothering heat of the 
Saudi desert. Called together by a three-member Arab League committee that 
engineered a shaky cease-fire Sept. 23, the Parliament launched a series of 
closed-door meetings on political reforms that would give Muslims a stronger 
voice in the government and eventually lead to the withdrawal of foreign troops 
from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Warring factions have temporarily dropped their guns but remain bitterly 
divided over what course the reforms should take, leaving grave doubts about 
whether any real agreement can be reached during this week's informal sessions. 
</P>
<P>
But the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, opening the talks with a 
statement from King Fahd, urged the deputies to use the committee's proposed 
reconciliation charter as a starting point from which to work out an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The past 14 years of war did not achieve anything. The time is now ripe to 
stop the shelling and accusations and start building peace with wisdom, 
patience and intelligence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You must rely on yourselves and prove to the world that you can achieve peace. 
The issue is now in your hands." 
</P>
<P>
The debate appeared bound for deadlock last week when Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, 
commander of the Maronite Christian forces and head of Lebanon's provisional 
Christian government, vowed to oppose implementation of political reforms 
unless the Arab League guarantees a pullout of Syrian troops from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40,000 Syrian Troops 
</P>
<P>
Damascus, which has an estimated 40,000 troops in the country under what began 
as a 1976 peacekeeping mandate, has already declared that it will not withdraw 
until political reforms are in place giving Muslims a stronger voice in the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new charter drawn up by the Arab League committee calls for 
redeploying Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley but gives them two 
years after a new, united government takes power to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the proposal is a plan for the Christians, once the most populous 
sect in Lebanon, to surrender their historic dominance to a partnership with 
the Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal suggests increasing the seats in Parliament from 99 to 128, to be 
divided equally between Muslims and Christians. At the same time, it would 
strip the authority of the president, traditionally a Christian, to appoint and 
dismiss prime ministers and vest that authority instead with Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been without a head of state since September, 1988, when the deeply 
divided Parliament was unable to elect a successor to former President Amin 
Gemayel. 
</P>
<P>
The political crisis led to the most vicious fighting of the civil war. Aoun, 
convinced that foreign intervention is to blame for Lebanon's problems, vowed 
to rout Syrian forces from the country. The Syrians retaliated with their own 
blockades of Christian ports and with stepped-up military support for Muslim 
militias. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 900 people have died in the latest round of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The last full meeting of Parliament was in June, 1988. Of that body's 99 
original deputies, all elected in Lebanon's last national elections in 1972, 
only 73 survive. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Parliament cannot legally convene outside Lebanon, any agreement 
reached here would have to be ratified inside the country. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies recessed after the opening session, then went behind closed doors 
for another 2 1/2-hour meeting Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials kept the deputies isolated in a hotel, at one point even 
cutting telephone lines in what may have been an attempt to avoid public 
posturing. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview with reporters, former Prime Minister Saeb Salaam said he 
is hopeful that a resolution can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
"I am always hopeful," he added. "It's my nature. But hope should help. We have 
so many problems."

SITE OF RECORD DRUG SEIZURE LURES LOOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Scores of looters and souvenir-hunters Saturday swarmed into the Sylmar 
warehouse that was the scene of the world's largest cocaine bust, as federal 
and local agents fanned out across the county in a fast-paced search for 
additional drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
Seven suspects -- including an alleged ringleader who fled to Las Vegas -- had 
been arrested by Saturday night in the milestone drug case. 
</P>
<P>
The looters descended on the warehouse shortly after authorities finished 
hauling away 20 tons of cocaine early Saturday. Officials of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration said they secured the warehouse as they left, but 
somehow the curious managed to gain access -- possibly through an overhead 
rolling door -- and spent hours poring over the velvet paintings of Jesus and 
Mexican ceramics that had served as a cover for the alleged drug-running 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someday this will be worth some money," James Stanley, 23, of Phoenix 
said as he loaded up his mother's Cadillac with paintings and plaster animal 
statues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remembering the Event 
</P>
<P>
"It's something to keep at home and remember from the big one," a man who would 
only identify himself as Fred said as people around him crawled on top of 
stacks of boxes, ripped them open and tossed paintings and statues down to 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the looting began at about 4:30 a.m. and reached a peak about 
three hours later. Only when a DEA agent arrived at 1 p.m. and called the 
police did the crowd of 50 or more begin to abate. 
</P>
<P>
The plunderers also were taking plastic bags marked "Drug Enforcement 
Administration Evidence" and investigators' used and discarded plastic gloves, 
but a DEA spokesman said nothing of "evidentiary value" had remained behind at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the agent who arrived at the warehouse Saturday afternoon 
gathered up whatever evidence bags were still scattered about and took them 
away. Two Los Angeles police officers padlocked the overhead door that may have 
been left open. 
</P>
<P>
The looting was a curious result of Friday's announcement that federal and 
local law enforcement agents, acting on a businessman's tip, had raided the 
warehouse and made the largest seizure of cocaine ever: 20 tons worth up to $6 
billion. Some estimates put the value even higher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chasing Leads 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Saturday they were working against the clock to chase leads 
and investigate clues from documents and records recovered at the warehouse. As 
word of the bust spreads through the cocaine underworld, authorities said, 
traffickers will be sent into hiding or will be moving swiftly to cover their 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure a lot of people are changing addresses and beepers, or being rotated 
to Miami," Deputy Dist. Atty. Curt Hazell said of the drug underworld. 
</P>
<P>
Hazell, who drew up the search warrants for the bust, said that although the 
documents, which include mobile phone records, will be difficult to decode, the 
information will nevertheless give investigators a rare opportunity to look 
more deeply into the cocaine network. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never peeled the onion back to what is behind the stash house," Hazell 
said. "This is the farthest back we have gone." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park police Detective D.J. Fitzgerald said a total of seven suspects 
had been arrested by Saturday night -- apparently everybody involved in the 
immediate warehouse operation. 
</P>
<P>
Four people were arrested in Los Angeles -- including two at luxury hotels 
where they had sought cover -- and three were taken into custody in their rooms 
at the Las Vegas Hilton on Flamingo Road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Identified 
</P>
<P>
DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge identified the three in Las Vegas as Carlos Tapia 
Ponce, 68; Hector Eduardo Tapia Ponce, 34, and Hector Tapia. Carlos Tapia Ponce 
worked as a customs inspector for the Mexican government in Ciudad Juarez for 
15 years, Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Other DEA sources said Tapia Ponce may be a key figure in the smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
"He appeared to be directing the operation," Hazell of the D.A.'s office said. 
"He is the person who rented the warehouse. He paid the bills." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were having a tough time identifying the other suspects. All are 
Spanish-speaking men who say they are from Mexico but otherwise keep giving 
fake information, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we talk to them, they give a new name and a new date of birth," 
Fitzgerald said. "None had a good I.D., nothing to connect them to a house or a 
particular area of the country. It effectively eliminates trying to find 
additional houses or addresses." 
</P>
<P>
There is good news for the five cities -- Huntington Park, Maywood, Bell, South 
Gate and Arcadia -- whose police departments played a major role in the bust. 
Under federal guidelines, agencies receive a share of cash seizures made in 
drug investigations, based on the amount of help they provided. Hazell said the 
departments involved "stand to get a real good chunk of the money." 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth proportions of the drug bust prompted Los Angeles officials to 
renew pleas for additional money and manpower from Washington to fight cocaine 
trafficking. But the Bush Administration on Saturday appeared reluctant to make 
a stronger commitment to Los Angeles, saying there are no "immediate" plans to 
step up enforcement in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Systematic Approach 
</P>
<P>
"We knew before this bust that Los Angeles was an area where a lot of narcotics 
traffic is concentrated," said Don Hamilton, spokesman for U.S. drug policy 
coordinator William Bennett. "We want to do what we can, but we believe we need 
to approach the question of high-intensity drug traffic areas seriously, 
soberly, systematically." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, additional details emerged on how the world's largest drug 
bust unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
A tipster, whose identity has been kept secret as a precaution, had set the 
investigation in motion with a call to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms after he became suspicious of activities at the warehouse in 
Sylmar, which used the name Adriana's. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the caller originally attempted to call the DEA but the line 
was busy. 
</P>
<P>
The information from the caller was passed by the ATF to DEA Agent James Capra, 
who then gave it to members of an 18-month-old task force of agents and local 
narcotics detectives from five cities who specialize in drug investigations 
involving truck transport. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday afternoon, about 12 detectives and DEA agents were spread out in 
and around the warehouse complex in the 12800 block of Bradley Avenue. Task 
force members were sure almost from the start that they had found a drug 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Gold Chains 
</P>
<P>
"They knew these guys were dope dealers just by the way they were acting, even 
though they were innocuous to the other people (in the complex)," said Hazell. 
"There were no Ferraris, no gold chains. They weren't flashy." 
</P>
<P>
The openness of the operation allowed investigators to see inside the warehouse 
from their hidden positions nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent that they were so confident that the warehouse was not going 
to be discovered that they left doors open, windows, even the garage door," 
said Fitzgerald, of the Huntington Park police. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, investigators decided to follow a car that had made a 
pickup at the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed the car to Baldwin Park, where the driver switched with an 
accomplice who had been waiting for him. The new driver of the car apparently 
became suspicious of being followed and parked at a fast-food restaurant, got 
out, walked away, then loitered in the area for about an hour, watching the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"He walked in and out of several businesses, several restaurants, made several 
calls," apparently to alert other members of the alleged drug network, 
Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
At about 5 p.m. Thursday the investigators moved in and arrested the man. 
Inside the car trunk, authorities found 20 kilos of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the second half of the surveillance team followed another car 
from the warehouse to an apartment complex next to the Sherman Oaks Galleria. 
Task force members raided the penthouse, arresting one man and seizing records 
with names of alleged drug runners and a key to the padlock on the warehouse 
door. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:50 p.m. the team went to the warehouse, found it unguarded, unlocked the 
padlock and history was made. Arrests of suspects, who began fleeing to luxury 
hotels, followed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The task force members had worked nearly 48 straight hours on the case but most 
of the investigators, awed by the size of the seizure they had made, returned 
to the warehouse Friday as reporters descended. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't sleep until you're done," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was removed Friday night -- just hours before the looters swept in 
-- and taken to a secret location. The packets will be photographed, 
fingerprinted, weighed and tested, and most of it will eventually be destroyed. 
Usually, authorities say they torch the stuff in special incinerators in 
unpopulated areas, using a process that purifies the byproducts of the burning 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Only a small portion will be kept for evidence, officials said, because of the 
risks and difficulties involved in storing such a massive amount. 
</P>
<P>
"The security they'd have to have to keep this stuff around is tighter than for 
pure gold," Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth said, "somewhere between 
pure gold and nerve gas." 
</P>

from Los Angeles. Douglas Jehl reported from Washington.

<P>
More than 4,000 East German refugees in West German embassies in Czechoslovakia 
and Poland began leaving the grounds of the missions late Saturday after a 
surprise agreement was reached to allow them to go by train to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic announcement, the official East German news agency ADN reported 
earlier Saturday that the Communist regime in East Berlin had agreed to "expel" 
the refugees aboard special rail coaches that will carry them to the West 
through East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials in Hof, a town in Bavaria near the East German border, 
said that the first trainload of incoming refugees is expected about 4 a.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Go to Reception Centers 
</P>
<P>
The refugees will taken to reception centers in West Germany, officials said, 
as have thousands of East Germans fleeing westward by way of Hungary in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's developments temporarily allayed the political crisis that involved 
West Germany, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland over the fate of East 
German refugees who had sought refuge in the embassies' grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was revealed after West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher -- after talks in Bonn with a senior East German official, Horst 
Neubauer -- unexpectedly flew to Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, where he 
drove directly to the West German Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
There he spoke from a balcony, telling a cheering group of the estimated 3,500 
East Germans camped out in the embassy compound that they would be allowed to 
go to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Welcome to Germany' 
</P>
<P>
"I came to tell you that you can leave," declared Genscher, who himself is from 
Halle in East Germany. "Welcome to Germany." 
</P>
<P>
He said the arrangements worked out with Communist regimes on the refugees was 
the "biggest success in my political career." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, West German officials said that about 650 East Germans 
sheltered in the Warsaw Embassy and at a Roman Catholic hostel in the Polish 
capital would also leave by train for the Federal Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher's statement was greeted with cries of "Freedom! Freedom!" Many of the 
East Germans wept openly and embraced one another at the handsome, baroque 
embassy complex in the heart of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
They had been living under tents in rudimentary conditions, worsened by cold 
rains and a mass of mud -- and by the soaring number of incoming refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"We made it; we made it," the refugees called to journalists outside the 
embassy's spiked fence. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have believed this," said one young man with his son on his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher told the East Germans that the first train to West Germany would leave 
at 8 p.m. local time. He was off by half an hour. The first train, pulled by an 
East German locomotive, left Prague's Liben station at 8:30 with about 400 East 
Germans aboard, some laughing, some singing and some seemingly dazed by the 
sudden turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to legalize the departure of the refugees, East German officials 
would issue exit visas about the trains while en route to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher said he had discussed the refugee crisis at the United Nations in New 
York last week with the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, East 
Germany and the Soviet Union. But he declined to give details of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed on complete discretion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, the news agency ADN reported: "In an effort to end the 
untenable situation in the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw, the East 
German government has arranged to expel to West Germany the East Germans 
illegally staying in these embassies by train through East German territory." 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia has a common border with West Germany, but Poland does not. 
</P>
<P>
The rail transit through East Germany was viewed by political observers in Bonn 
as a face-saving device by which the East Berlin regime could claim it was 
expelling the refugees from its own territory, rather than watching them flee 
through other Communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, has an accord with East Germany, agreeing not to 
let East Germans cross its territory to the West without proper credentials 
issued by East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 10, the Hungarian government decided to suspend the pact in order to 
allow thousands of East Germans in refugee camps there to depart for West 
Germany without exit visas. 
</P>
<P>
That action angered the East Berlin government, but the Communist government in 
Budapest evidently believed it had more to gain from Western countries by its 
humanitarian actions than it lost in breaking Communist solidarity with East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, about 25,000 East Germans have streamed across the Hungarian border 
into Austria and then West Germany. The Bonn government recognizes all Germans, 
East or West, as its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Poland and Czechoslovakia, friends of East Berlin, nevertheless wish to 
maintain cordial relations with West Germany for trade and economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The East Berlin ADN report said that East German Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Wolfgang Meyer declared that the Communist regime had complied with West German 
requests to allow the refugees to leave, after consulting the governments in 
Prague and Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
The refugee crisis has deeply upset East Germany, which is planning a large 
celebration on Saturday to observe the 40th anniversary of the creation of the 
state. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev heads the Communist guest list. 
</P>
<P>
The East Berlin regime has been hoping to brighten up its image, damaged by the 
flight of about 100,000 East Germans, authorized and unauthorized, this year. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Meyer said he hopes that the joint gesture by East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia, and Poland would ensure that conditions would return to normal 
at West German diplomatic missions in all three countries. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw and its mission in East Berlin have been 
closed to the public for weeks because of the influx of would-be emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, government sources indicated that part of the deal struck with 
Czechoslovakia and Poland would be that the Saturday night train ride to the 
West would be limited to those East Germans already in embassy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist governments do not want to deal with the problem again, these 
sources indicated, but it was not clear how they would keep East Germans from 
entering West German missions unless police guards are posted.

TWO CASES DOCUMENT AIDS TRANSMISSION THROUGH ORAL SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco Department of Public Health has documented what are 
apparently the first two cases in California of AIDS virus transmission between 
two men through oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers said the new data confirm other reports of transmission of the 
human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, through oral sex and reinforce earlier 
warnings from public health officials that the practice does not represent safe 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Exposure to semen, whether oral, vaginal or rectal, carries a risk of 
transmission of HIV," Dr. Alan R. Lifson, assistant director for research of 
the department's AIDS office, said in a telephone interview Saturday. Lifson 
added that although oral sex may be "less risky" than anal intercourse as a 
means of transmitting the AIDS virus, it is "not safe." 
</P>
<P>
Public health officials emphasize several strategies to avoid exposure to the 
AIDS virus through sexual intercourse. These include using condoms, avoiding 
the exchange of bodily fluids, such as semen, and abstaining from sexual 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS virus is contained in the semen, as well as the blood, of infected 
individuals. The virus might be transmitted to a sexual partner during oral 
intercourse through small cuts or sores in the mouth, diseased gums or normal 
oral tissue. Researchers, however, are not certain of the exact means of 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
Lifson said he was "confident" of the findings in the two "very recent" cases. 
Both men had only one risk factor for HIV infection -- exposure to semen 
through receptive oral intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
The two men had been studied extensively over the last five years as part of a 
citywide San Francisco study of thousands of gay and bisexual men. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous studies, the two men had tested negative for AIDS virus 
antibodies. This summer, they both tested positive. A test known as the 
polymerase chain reaction, which is a more sensitive blood test than the 
standard antibody test, confirmed that the earlier AIDS antibodies tests were 
negative, Lifson said. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed sexual and personal histories revealed that one man had receptive oral 
sex with multiple partners whose HIV infection status was unknown. The other 
man also had oral sex with multiple partners, one of whom was known to be 
infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
"The interviewers . . . were quite confident that the information they received 
was accurate," Lifson said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been several earlier reports in medical journals describing apparent 
cases of HIV transmission between two men through oral sex. In September, 1987, 
Boston researchers reported such a case in the Annals of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Massachusetts researchers described a case of apparent 
female-to-male transmission of the AIDS virus through oral sex. But the 
reliability of the report, which was published as a letter in the New England 
Journal of Medicine, was questioned by other AIDS physicians.

COMPOSER AND MUSIC CRITIC VIRGIL THOMSON DIES AT 92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Virgil Thomson, the critic and composer who mixed the historical ingredients of 
music into a blend of luxuriant harmonies that stood in stark contrast to the 
wild experimentation of his time, died in his sleep early Saturday at his 
apartment in New York's Chelsea Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, who as a newspaper commentator once described Jascha Heifetz's oeuvre 
as "silk underwear music," was 92. He was said to have been one of the prime 
reasons the world of international art accepted the modern American musical 
idiom. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson succumbed to a "long-term illness," according to his secretary, 
Jeffrey Adelson. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, who never married, is survived by a niece, Betty Stouffer, of 
Longwood, Fla. He will be buried in a family plot in Slater, Mo. A memorial 
service is planned at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan on Nov. 
25. 
</P>
<P>
For 70 years, either by himself or with such literary legends as Gertrude 
Stein, the cherubic sage of American music churned out a large number of 
operas, ballets, symphonies and chamber works, melding into them American folk 
tunes, hymns and even cowboy songs. 
</P>
<P>
They proved permanently palatable if not outrageously popular. 
</P>
<P>
And from 1940 to 1954 -- as he continued to compose memorable melodies -- he 
also manufactured acerbic and provocative prose as the New York Herald 
Tribune's music critic in a style one writer likened to "letters home to Aunt 
Phyllis." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those "letters," however, might have offended that maiden aunt's 
sensibilities. Such as the time he wrote that Sibelius' Second Symphony was 
"vulgar, self-indulgent and provincial beyond all description." Or the review 
of "Porgy and Bess" that noted that "its faults are numberless but its 
inspiration is authentic, its expressive quotient high." Or that a Vladimir 
Horowitz trill was "in every way the berries." 
</P>
<P>
His feud with Heifetz ended only with the legendary violinist's death in 1987 
and reflected only a minor portion of the Thomson credo, one he had formed in 
his youth and never abandoned: that the quality of the music is vastly more 
important than the capabilities of the performer. 
</P>
<P>
He also offered not just critiques of music and musicians but his feelings 
about the composers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Mozart," Thomson once fumed as he summed up his view of the personal failings 
of the major composers of the Western world, "was not, like Wagner, a political 
revolutionary. Nor was he, like Beethoven, an old fraud who just talked about 
human rights and dignity but who was really an irascible, intolerant and 
scheming careerist. . . . unjust toward the poor, lickspittle toward the rich, 
dishonest in business, unjust and unforgiving toward the members of his family. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
More important to 20th-Century criticism than the postulations themselves was 
the historical position of their author. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote About Modern Music 
</P>
<P>
Virgil Garnett Thomson came into the critical arena when it was dominated by 
men who considered anything written after 1899 unworthy of note. Thomson not 
only caught the world's attention with his scathing diatribes but in his 
travels wrote of such postwar composers as the German Carl Orff and the 
Frenchman Pierre Boulez. The masses were reading of the music of their own time 
-- and thus making of Thomson a major figure in the modern music movement. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of his tenure at the Herald Tribune, he had established critical 
credentials as impressive as those he had earned earlier for his music. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the best known of the hundreds of works the prolific Thomson composed 
were three operas: "Four Saints in Three Acts," "The Mother of Us All" and 
"Lord Byron" plus, curiously enough, some film scores. One of them, "Louisiana 
Story" in 1948, was awarded the only Pulitzer Prize for distinguished musical 
composition ever given to a film. 
</P>
<P>
That disparity is typical of the Thomson diversity. If his music shares a 
common thread at all it is one linked to his boyhood years in Middle America. 
He was born there -- in Kansas City, Mo., the son of a postal clerk who had wed 
a woman whose English ancestors settled Virginia. The lure of Americana was 
intrinsic. 
</P>
<P>
He took his first piano lessons when he was 5 and by 12 was performing 
professionally at churches and local concerts. Thomson was an academic prodigy 
as well, and showed an early interest in composition, which he would follow at 
college. 
</P>
<P>
He attended officers school at Columbia University after enlisting in the Army 
in 1917 but the Armistice prevented him seeing active service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studied in Paris 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled in Europe, took classes in musical composition and writing and, 
inspired by Amy Lowell's poem, "Vernal Equinox," managed his first composition, 
a song. He also was a singer and toured Europe with the Harvard Glee Club. When 
the others returned he remained to study with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually came home, graduated from Harvard in 1923 and taught there while 
writing music and articles on music for Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
When his financial situation failed to improve he told friends that if he were 
to starve as a composer he "preferred to starve where the food is good." He 
returned to Paris and settled on the Left Bank where he composed "Sonata da 
Chiesa," a traditional piece in contrast with the dissonance prevalent in music 
of the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, the critic Harold C. Schonberg of the New York Times once observed, 
wrote on the "white keys" in "a period when desperate dissonance was in 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
In 1926, he was introduced to Gertrude Stein. He already had become attracted 
to her experiments with language and, after meeting her, wrote a cantata based 
on her "Capitals, Capitals." 
</P>
<P>
The following year they began work on what most critics believe will be 
Thomson's most enduring musical legacy: "Four Saints in Three Acts." 
Essentially it was an opera of nonsense, blending humor and metaphor in what 
alternately is America and 16th-Century Spain. The allegory is filled with 
Stein-isms (its most famous "Pigeons in the grass alas") and its production 
marked the melding of the talents of John Houseman (director), Frederick Ashton 
(choreographer) and Florine Stettheimer (the immortal cellophane and glass bead 
sets). 
</P>
<P>
It was half acting and half dance as the saints erect their cathedrals in a 
setting that Thomson said was "like the artistic life that we (the Bohemian 
expatriates of Paris) were all living." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Performed Six Years Later 
</P>
<P>
Finished in 1928, Thomson's haunting masterwork -- which features closer to 40 
than four saints and involves four, not three, acts -- was not produced until 
1934. When it was, Thomson's tuneful score juxtaposed against Stein's 
avant-garde, free-spirited libretto made him an overnight sensation. 
</P>
<P>
(The original cast was all black, creating additional tempest at a time when 
blacks were used only in black-related themes and not in hymn-like and hypnotic 
ventures into things theological. Blacks were used, Thomson said in a 1981 
interview because of their "beauty." "Blacks sing so beautifully and they look 
so beautiful.") 
</P>
<P>
Although it is resurrected occasionally, "Four Saints," has never been staged 
at the Metropolitan Opera or New York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
More popular, successful and more frequently performed was a second and much 
later collaboration with Stein, "The Mother of Us All," an operatic paean to 
Susan B. Anthony written in 1946-47. In it Thomson sprinkled American dances, 
marches and hymns and folk songs in quilt-like manner. The critic Schonberg 
said it "may be recognized as one of the few examples of genuine Americana on 
the lyric stage." 
</P>
<P>
Thomson spent the years after "Four Saints" in Paris, leaving only when the 
Germans invaded France. Although it was a relatively bleak period in his 
professional life as far as performances were concerned, with the dissonant 
writers in fashion, Thomson did write music for New York shows including 
"Macbeth" in 1936, in which Orson Welles directed a black Federal Theater cast. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to the United States in 1940, he wrote some radio background 
music, particularly for the CBS Workshop broadcast of "The Trojan Woman" and 
then reunited with Stein for "The Mother of Us All" which has been staged more 
than 3,000 times. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Louisiana Story," other films Thomson scored included "The Plow 
That Broke the Plains" and "The River," both with Midwestern backgrounds much 
like the composer's own, "The Goddess" and "Voyage to America," actor-director 
Houseman's documentary about immigrants to America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Musical 'Portraits' 
</P>
<P>
He also began working on his "portraits," scores of musical piano tributes of 
people he admired. They ran the gamut from Picasso to Aaron Copland to Fiorello 
LaGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a ballet -- "Filling Station" -- for Lincoln Kirstein's Ballet Caravan 
in 1937, preceding Copland's scoring for such American dance pageants as "Billy 
the Kid" and "Rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
In 1972 he wrote his third opera, "Lord Byron," a tribute to George Gordon 
Byron, the defiant, melancholy British poet. It was performed by the Juilliard 
School in 1972 but seldom seen again. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson's 85th birthday, in 1981, sparked a series of parties and the 
publication of "A Virgil Thomson Reader," a 582-page anthology of the best of 
his written criticism. The 5-foot-5 composer was saluted at parties throughout 
New York and interviewed by fellow critics in the old-fashioned elegance of the 
Hotel Chelsea in Manhattan where he had lived for years. 
</P>
<P>
His 90th birthday was less frenetic but did result in more desultory interviews 
in which the lifelong bachelor refused to evaluate himself or his music for 
posterity. He did tell a writer for New York magazine that "it (the music) 
lives its own life. But I suspect that long from now, when things have settled 
down, Copland's ballets and my operas will remain." 
</P>
<P>
As to his unique and distinctive career as both artist and critic, Thomson 
observed "it takes three people to make music properly: one man to write it, 
another to play it and a third to criticize it. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything else is just a rehearsal."

<P>
In a major victory for consumers, Gov. George Deukmejian has signed legislation 
requiring retailers, cable television companies and utilities to arrange a 
four-hour period to deliver their goods or services and allow customers to sue 
if the company does not fulfill its obligation, the governor's office announced 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, by Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) has been described by a Consumers 
Union representative as "the most important bill" for consumers this year. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, plowing through hundreds of bills sent to him by the Legislature in 
the closing hours of the 1989 session, also signed legislation increasing 
unemployment benefits and a measure to help local school districts reduce the 
size of high school classes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toxic Waste Bill Vetoed 
</P>
<P>
The Republican chief executive vetoed a bill that would have stopped toxic 
waste disposers with a history of permit violations from getting new permits 
from the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Lockyer measure, known as the "home delivery bill," arose out of a 
complaint from a constituent who missed five days of work waiting for the cable 
television company to connect its service. Each day, Lockyer said, the woman 
was told that the wiring would be installed the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer said the woman's experience was an extreme example of something that 
irks consumers all across the state: they make special arrangements to be home 
to accept a new appliance or to have a utility service connected only to have 
the company arrive hours late, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
Individual consumers who lose wages or incur other expenses under such 
circumstances have little recourse against major corporations, Lockyer argued, 
so it makes sense for the state to intervene on behalf of the "little guy." 
</P>
<P>
The new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, will require retailers with more than 
25 employees, cable television companies and utilities to agree in advance with 
the consumer on a four-hour period during which their goods or services will be 
delivered. If the consumer is home and the company fails to make good on its 
promise, the customer will be able to sue in small claims court for damages of 
up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notification Required 
</P>
<P>
The bill also requires utilities and cable companies to notify subscribers, 
either at the time a service connection or repair is requested or by mail three 
times a year, of their right to have service or connections performed within a 
four-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer said Saturday his measure is the first of its kind in the country and 
that other states, riding a wave of consumer dissatisfaction, may enact similar 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The level of service received by typical consumers is inadequate," he said. 
"Most companies, in most instances, provide acceptable service. But the number 
of instances of very poor service is much larger than should be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
The measure provides exceptions for delays caused by "unforeseen or 
unavoidable" circumstances beyond the control of the retailer or utility, as 
long as the company makes a diligent attempt to notify the customer of the 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's office on Saturday also announced that the governor had: 
</P>
<P>
* Signed legislation by Sen. David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to increase the 
maximum unemployment insurance benefits from $166 weekly to $230, with the 
increases phased in through 1992. The minimum compensation will increase from 
$30 weekly to $40 on Jan. 1, 1990. The increase will be the first since 
Deukmejian took office in 1983, and it is coupled with changes in the system to 
decrease the cost of unemployment insurance for employers. 
</P>
<P>
* Signed a bill by Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills) to give financial 
incentives to school districts that reduce the size of high school classes for 
math, science, English and social studies to no more than 20 students. The bill 
allots up to $75 million to reduce class sizes and another $35 million for 
special programs in grades one through three. 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed legislation by Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) to 
prohibit hazardous waste disposal companies with a history of permit violations 
from obtaining new permits. Deukmejian said he preferred to leave such 
decisions to the discretion of the state Health Services Department and said 
that a "rigid application of the law would seriously impede the ability of the 
department to regulate in an effective and equitable manner." 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed a bill by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) that 
would have required the state Judicial Council to develop and provide a fact 
sheet to county clerks on the rights and obligations of marriage partners. The 
fact sheet would have been distributed to all couples applying for a marriage 
license. In his veto message, the governor said he was "not convinced that the 
benefits of such a fact sheet" would be worth the $34,000 it would cost the 
state to develop it. 
</P>
<P>
* Signed a measure by Assemblyman William J. Filante (R-Greenbrae) to require 
all new buildings constructed after Jan. 1, 1992, to have toilets that use no 
more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush. Many toilets today use 3.5 gallons.

REA'S TENACITY SHOWS WHY SOME GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS NEVER DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seldom has a government program had more direct impact on the lives of ordinary 
Americans than Franklin D. Roosevelt's plan to bring electric and telephone 
service to the nation's rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Few things will add more to the comfort, satisfaction and happiness of the 
rural population," a congressional committee declared in establishing the 
program in 1936, when only 12% of rural America had electricity or telephones. 
</P>
<P>
By now, virtually the entire nation has both. So why does the Rural 
Electrification Administration still cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year? Why does it supply subsidies to subsidiaries of major 
corporations and to the residents of posh resort areas, including Hilton Head, 
S.C., and Aspen and Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Washington Truism 
</P>
<P>
The answer is one of Washington's eternal truths: Few things are as immortal as 
a government program. When bureaucracies finish the work they were set up to 
do, they usually find new work to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
The billions of dollars in subsidies that the REA has provided over the years 
have built up a large constituency -- electric and telephone utility 
cooperatives that depend on the program and protect it fiercely. Members of 
Congress from rural districts zealously watch over the program's fate. 
</P>
<P>
While the REA's costs are but a small part of federal spending, the agency's 
staying power helps illustrate President Bush's predicament as he begins 
preparing next year's federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has to be flexible over time," said a senior Administration 
budget official. "Right now, it's stuck. We can't cut the old stuff and there's 
no room for new stuff." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banking on Forgetfulness 
</P>
<P>
That lack of flexibility has helped create a government of empty promises. Rep. 
Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), the House Budget Committee chairman, said: "As 
new priorities, new needs are there to be faced, the politics of the time is to 
announce concern, get the 30-second spot (on television), then hope that 
everyone forgets the need to deliver on those promises." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promised Funds 
</P>
<P>
But some programs remain mired in a limbo of promised funds -- the space 
program, for example, where Bush has pledged a mission to Mars but has offered 
no money to meet the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II have suffered from the same 
treatment. Former President Ronald Reagan last year signed legislation that 
promised a $20,000 payment to each of the 60,000 former internees. 
</P>
<P>
But the money has not been forthcoming. Now, Congress is promising to begin 
providing the funds as early as next year but advocates for the internees, many 
of whom are now quite elderly, fear that many will die before the government 
pays its debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeless Aid Cited 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the homeless have fared similarly. Congress has passed laws 
establishing several homeless aid programs, none of which have yet received the 
full amount pledged. Bush, who promised during his campaign to "fully fund" 
programs for the homeless, opposed adding money to the current year's budget to 
do so, although he has asked Congress to fully fund the programs in the fiscal 
year that began today. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens who lobby Congress for government programs often find these broken 
promises "mind-boggling," said Maria Foscarinis, who has been a leading 
advocate for homeless aid. 
</P>
<P>
The government, she said, "promises a certain level of funding and then turns 
around and takes it away. It's hard to explain to people in the real world. . . 
. It adds to a certain degree of cynicism." 
</P>
<P>
But just as it is difficult to get new programs into the budget, it is nearly 
impossible to get old programs out of it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Example of Problem 
</P>
<P>
The REA is "a classic example" of the problem, said Edwin L. Dale, a longtime 
budget expert who serves as a senior adviser to Richard G. Darman, director of 
the Office of Management and Budget. "The budget is essentially locked up 
before you start." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provides Access to Capital 
</P>
<P>
The REA is essentially a loan program, conceived at a time when rural areas 
were starved for credit and banks were unwilling to lend money to 
consumer-owned utility cooperatives. The program guaranteed co-ops access to 
capital that allowed them to string electric lines needed to bring light and 
power to America's farms. The co-ops would repay the government, using the 
money that their consumers paid for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, as the REA's sponsors repeatedly pointed out, no subsidy was 
involved. The co-ops had to pay the government full interest at the going rate, 
then about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, when interest rates began to rise, Congress kept the REA loan 
rate low. Rural electric and telephone cooperatives borrow from the government 
at low rates -- often as low as 5%. The Treasury then must borrow from the 
public at much higher rates, currently about 8%. The difference amounts to a 
huge subsidy for rural electric and telephone companies, much of which never 
shows up on the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Today, that subsidy often benefits people far different from the Depression-era 
farmers who were the main concern of the REA's sponsors. One of the REA's 
biggest recent borrowers, for example, is the Palmetto Electric Cooperative in 
South Carolina. The cooperative has seen rapid growth in its service area in 
recent years, largely because of the posh Hilton Head resort development that 
lies off the Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Areas Now Prosperous 
</P>
<P>
Several other cooperatives serve areas that were once rural but are now part of 
fast-growing suburban areas outside cities, including Atlanta, Minneapolis and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The REA supporters argue that most of those co-ops also serve poor rural areas 
that are adjacent to the more prosperous locales. Palmetto, for example, serves 
a deeply impoverished, largely black stretch of the Carolina coast, said 
Eleanor Miller of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Assn., the co-ops' 
lobbying group in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
If the REA were shut down, Miller said of the co-ops' rural customers, "private 
power companies still wouldn't serve them." 
</P>
<P>
Administration analysts challenge that conclusion. Many rural telephone 
cooperatives, they point out, have been bought up in recent years by large 
national telephone companies precisely because they are profitable. The 
companies remain eligible for the REA subsidies even though the parent firms 
are among the largest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt, however, that ending the REA's subsidy programs by 
requiring all cooperatives to borrow funds at the market rate -- or even 
substantially cutting the programs back, as the Bush Administration has 
advocated -- would cause rural electric and telephone bills to rise. That 
prospect has caused rural members of Congress and their allies to fight 
fiercely for the survival of the programs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, a popular Reagan and his budget director, David A. Stockman, tried to 
slash the REA funds. The effort was routed in the House "something like 400 to 
8," recalled Frederick Khedouri, a key aide to Stockman at the time. "No one 
else could do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has followed Reagan's lead in proposing large 
reductions of the REA programs. So far, it has had no luck. The House and 
Senate have approved the REA's budget for next year, and both rejected the 
proposed reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The program's tenacity reflects several factors. 
</P>
<P>
One is peculiar to the REA and related agriculture programs -- the continuing 
clout of rural members in Congress. Sparsely populated rural states have as 
much representation as California in the Senate, and in the House, members from 
rural districts have disproportionate seniority. 
</P>
<P>
One of the REA's strongest supporters, for example, is the chairman of the 
House Appropriations Committee, Jamie L. Whitten (D-Miss.), who has represented 
a mostly rural north Mississippi district long enough to become the most senior 
member of the House. "If Jamie Whitten felt a strong attachment to your cause," 
said Khedouri, "you'd do well to, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Helps People 
</P>
<P>
Other factors behind the REA's tenacity are common to many government programs. 
First, the program continues to aid some people who need help. The REA 
subsidies are used to help the poor in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
And as with most federal programs, the flow of the REA money has created a 
constituency -- in this case the co-ops -- that lobbies to keep the money 
flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"In many areas, the co-op is the biggest employer in the area," said Miller of 
the cooperative association. Co-op directors are often prominent members of 
their communities, easily able to influence their congressmen. The association 
also maintains a large political action committee that contributed several 
hundred thousand dollars last year to members of Congress.

MOSCOW EXHIBIT POKES FUN AT LATE SOVIET LEADER;

ONCE-MIGHTY BREZHNEV IS NOW THE BUTT OF JOKES

<P>
The recorded voice of former Kremlin leader Leonid I. Brezhnev resounded 
sonorously through a community center in western Moscow on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Amid cracks in the walls, tattered curtains and peeling paint, his photographs 
were everywhere, showing him strolling in a fur cap, smoking a cigarette, 
signing a treaty -- always with his medals on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Help us escape from Brezhnev and the period of stagnation. Donate money for 
our perestroika," read a sign, using the Russian word for restructuring that 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev also uses to refer to his reform program. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was not a good week for the memory of Brezhnev, who led this 
country from 1964 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet stripped him of his Order of Victory 
war medal, a public acknowledgement that at least some of the 114 medals 
bestowed upon the former leader were awarded without foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First of Its Kind 
</P>
<P>
Then, a 40-year-old, dilapidated neighborhood community center raised 1,800 
rubles, or about $2,700, for repairs by collecting donations at a 
first-of-its-kind fund-raiser -- an exhibit that poked fun at the former 
Kremlin leader. 
</P>
<P>
Since Gorbachev became Communist Party general secretary in March, 1985, the 
Brezhnev era has been steadily discredited and officially dubbed the period of 
zastoye, or stagnation, a reference to corrupt and apathetic bureaucrats who 
blocked Soviet progress. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a city renamed after Brezhnev was given back its original 
name, and several factories and farms, squares and streets once honoring his 
memory also were renamed. A plaque marking Brezhnev's Moscow residence was 
unceremoniously removed several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But both the decision to take back the war medal and the theme of the 
fund-raiser at the local Dom Kulturi, or House of Culture community center -- 
two blows in the same week -- went beyond the bounds of discrediting the former 
leader to depict him as a buffoon. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole show makes a joke of Brezhnev," said Dom Kulturi director Vladislav 
V. Panfilov, 35, who wandered the hall wearing a lifelike Brezhnev face mask. 
</P>
<P>
"But it also has a serious goal. We are trying to show the results of the epoch 
of stagnation and encourage people to actively work to change things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, which ended a two-week run Saturday, presented as farcical some of 
Brezhnev's pronouncements. "Economy must be economical," a poster quoted from 
one of his speeches, and then went on to add: "And culture must be cultural. 
Butter must be buttery." 
</P>
<P>
Brezhnev's recorded speeches droned through the hall. "We play it all day, but 
I have no idea what he's saying," Panfilov said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the photographs of the former leader were identified as presents from 
some of the neighborhood's 2,000 families. A gaping hole in the wall was, 
according to a sign beneath it, a present from the Moscow Building Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The community center also took a gibe at Gorbachev and today's social problems. 
A table displayed all of the things currently unavailable or in short supply in 
Moscow: sugar, detergent, soap, salt and condoms. A sign noted that even during 
the stagnation period, these things could be found. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit included a book in which visitors could write their thoughts and 
messages to Gorbachev, but the nearly filled book was stolen last week. 
</P>
<P>
Not all visitors have appreciated the cutting humor of the Dom Kulturi 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"One man who came in here was very angry. He said we should be beaten," said 
Panfilov. "We said it wasn't our fault if he didn't understand our sense of 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
In a further step discrediting Brezhnev, Friday's newspapers carried a decree 
signed by Gorbachev stripping the former leader of one of his medals -- this 
one the country's highest military honor, the Order of Victory. 
</P>
<P>
Brezhnev was awarded the medal in 1978 for his role in a minor battle on the 
Black Sea coast during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle of Little Island 
</P>
<P>
The battle of Malaya Zemlya, or Little Land, was given little attention until 
Brezhnev became general secretary. Then, historians began describing it as a 
turning point in the war, comparable to the defense of Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Brezhnev's own account of the battle, which he wrote in a book titled "Little 
Land," won the top Soviet literary prize. A song written about it was once a 
popular tune on Moscow Radio. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper Izvestia reported Friday that Brezhnev, who rarely 
appeared in public without his medals, ordered duplicates and kept them pinned 
to his suits to save him trouble when changing. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the newspaper reported, "It is quite obvious that L.I. Brezhnev did not 
deserve such an award." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Brezhnev is now a joke," said Dom Kulturi director Panfilov. "But it's a 
tragic joke. We lost so much time, and it will take much work to modernize our 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti scrawled on a discolored wall of the community center, and signed by 
A.P. Zaitseva, expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Russia with a heavy heart," Zaitseva wrote. "I hate our untalented 
leadership. But we, because of our silent obedience, are to blame."

UKRAINE A STUMBLING BLOCK FOR REFORMS, GORBACHEV WARNS

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned Saturday that his reform program will 
falter across the country if it stumbles in the Ukraine, the Soviet Union's 
second-largest republic, which recently has been racked by nationalist, labor 
and religious unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Ivashko, the new Communist Party leader of the republic and a 
strong Gorbachev supporter who was elected three days ago after the ousting of 
conservative Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, pledged for his part to improve food 
supplies, social services and housing. 
</P>
<P>
The interviews with Gorbachev and Ivashko appeared in the official Communist 
Party daily Pravda. Shcherbitsky also was interviewed and said that it was 
difficult for him to relinquish his post. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev made it clear that he is staking high hopes on the Ukraine, the 
Soviet breadbasket and an important coal-producing and industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
"If perestroika falters in the Ukraine, it will falter throughout the entire 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he praised Ivashko, saying, "I am sure that a very good base for political 
leadership has been created in the Ukrainian party." 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky, 71, a staunch conservative who headed the Ukrainian party 
organization for 17 years, had come under increasing criticism in recent months 
and thus had become a growing liability to Gorbachev, who is in the midst of an 
effort to revive public confidence in the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation is scheduled to be introduced into the current session of the 
Supreme Soviet, the nation's Parliament, that would for the first time permit 
the formation of independent political parties. 
</P>
<P>
Such proposed legislation surely makes the Kremlin uneasy, and Gorbachev 
clearly is concerned with making sure party leaders have broad public support. 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky's critics had noted his inability to deal with a miners' strike 
this summer in the Donbass region, the country's largest coal field. Gorbachev 
himself appeared to support the demands of many of the miners, who simply 
sought better living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shcherbitsky responded with uncompromising hostility to Ukrainian 
nationalists, who in recent weeks held a founding meeting and whose leaders had 
demanded his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he appeared powerless as members of the outlawed Ukrainian Catholic 
Church grew increasingly agitated. More than 100,000 people demonstrated in the 
city of Lvov in September to demand religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are very dissatisfied," said Ivashko, 56. "The tempo of renewal in 
various spheres of life in the republic . . . is clearly insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
"We will devote our attention to resolving the housing and food problems, 
making more staple goods available, improving health care and resolving 
ecological issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivashko added that he also intends to work to strengthen the role of the party 
in society so that it does not lose the initiative to informal political groups 
that have formed in many of the country's 15 republics. 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky, who was ousted from the Politburo in early September, told 
Pravda, "I will say very openly it was not very easy to take the decision to 
retire after so many years of intensive work." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told Pravda that Shcherbitsky's many years of party work "deserved a 
high evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
He said republican party leaders at Thursday's meeting praised Shcherbitsky "as 
a person who worked very hard and was not satisfied with what he achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, in the neighboring republic of Byelorussia, about 9,000 
protesters walked through the capital of Minsk, demonstrating against the slow 
pace of the cleanup after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who were defying an official ban against their march, 
carried signs bearing the names of areas still suffering from high radiation 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 31 people are known to have died as a result of the accident, 
according to official figures.

'GERMAN QUESTION' RAISES HOPES, FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
EAST'S REFUGEE EXODUS PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON REUNIFICATION ISSUE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The sensitive issue of German reunification has surfaced again as a burning 
political topic in Europe -- very much discomfiting the major players involved. 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of the "German Question" -- the diplomatic code phrase for 
reunifying the two Germanys -- is the unwelcome result of the refugee crisis 
and near-paralysis of the East German Communist regime, hobbled by the health 
of its leader, Erich Honecker. 
</P>
<P>
"We West Germans have been busy reassuring our allies that the German Question 
was not on our agenda," said Gert Krell, executive director of Frankfurt's 
Peace Research Institute, in a conversation. "But now nobody can escape from 
the question." 
</P>
<P>
Most West German and Western Alliance officials, as well as those in East 
Germany and the Soviet Union, would just as soon keep the "German Problem," as 
it is also called, on the far back-burner, or off the stove entirely. 
</P>
<P>
They favor stability rather than unrest in Eastern Europe, and nobody wants to 
rock the boat by bringing up the inflammatory question of German reunification. 
For the lingering German dream of ending the country's division after World War 
II and forming a powerful nation of 80 million people is almost everyone else's 
nightmare, conjuring up the possibility of an aggressive Fourth Reich. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, the latest discussion has been revived not by nationalistic West 
Germans but by outside events: the fear that the inflexible East Berlin regime 
could fall sooner rather than later, with such a collapse leading to a sudden 
de facto move toward reunification. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On World's Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently informed the Bundestag, "The developments of 
the past few weeks have made clear that the German Question has stayed on the 
agenda of world politics." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Vernon A. Walters declared that German 
reunification could occur in the "near future." 
</P>
<P>
And the subject was a recurrent one, although not scheduled, in the corridors 
at the annual meeting of experts of the International Institute for Strategic 
Studies (IISS) two weeks ago in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the argument has roiled the West German political scene. Some 
opposition Social Democrats criticized Kohl's statement on the grounds that it 
would encourage even more East German trouble and refugees -- with which the 
Bonn government is ill prepared to deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Kohl went too far," said one German political analyst. "The last thing (to do) 
is to give this issue prominence. We want stability now -- not reunification." 
</P>
<P>
And Horst Afheldt, with the Max Planck Society in Starnberg, said: "We have 
been spending billions of marks subsidizing East Germany to keep it stable. We 
don't want an empty room in East Germany. That could be catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat in East Berlin believes that Kohl's statement was simply a 
device to fend off critics from the right-wing Bavarian branch of his party, 
the Christian Democratic Union, and the far-right party, the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democrats are also divided on whether to maintain 
friendly relations with the East Berlin regime in the interests of inner-German 
harmony and stability or to damn them for the repressive measures that have led 
to the refugee exodus and talk of reunification. 
</P>
<P>
But most responsible West Germans are trying to keep the volatile reunification 
issue in perspective. For the fact is, according to various polls, that the 
issue has not generated much concern among ordinary Germans, who, while 
theoretically in favor of reunifying sometime in the future, are not eager to 
lower their standard of living to accommodate 17 million additional Germans in 
a poorer state. 
</P>
<P>
"Some commentators have accused Bonn and its allies of tiptoeing around the 
German Question," said Karl Kaiser, director of the Foreign Policy Institute of 
Bonn, at the IISS meeting in Oslo. "I believe the question can be resolved only 
within the context of the integration of Europe, with Germany as an essential 
element. It will still essentially be a step-by-step process." 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable disagreement among foreign policy specialists about the 
predicted dissolution of the East German regime and what role Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev might play in such a situation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way the German Question is going to wait in the wings until all of 
the other European security problems are settled," said one diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Enno von Loewenstern, editorial page director of the conservative West German 
paper, Die Welt, goes further, declaring: "Gorbachev said something about 
history deciding on the German Question in a hundred years or so. But history 
is deciding right now; the fall of communism in East Germany and the 
reunification of Germany are hardly a matter of even a few years any more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regime Well Entrenched 
</P>
<P>
But most observers believe that the East German regime is still well 
entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever form reunification may eventually take, almost every West German 
analyst and official agrees, it will not be the return to the 1937 borders of 
the Third Reich, as other Europeans sometimes worry. 
</P>
<P>
As Karl Kaiser put it: "Reunification suggests putting back together two old 
geographic and political elements from 40 years ago. But they are both gone 
today." 
</P>
<P>
And Gert Krell adds: "The German Question should no longer be seen in terms of 
the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. We no longer have that old nationalism, and were 
talking about economic integration within the European Community. We are in a 
totally different world than in the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
It was then, in 1952, that Chancellor Konrad Adenauer spurned the tentative 
offer of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to reunify Germany in return for 
neutralism and demilitarization. 
</P>
<P>
And though the former wartime allies support German reunification in principle, 
few officials in Washington, London, Paris and Moscow have favored putting the 
principle into action. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior adviser to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said brusquely 
over lunch: "We are very happy with Germany the way it is: divided. Smell of 
reunification makes them unreliable allies." 
</P>
<P>
And a central element of post-war French policy has been to forge unbreakable 
links with West Germany, directing Bonn's energies to the Western Alliance and 
ending the bloody cycle of Franco-German wars. In this, France has been 
successful: The Paris-Bonn relationship is at the core of the European 
Community. 
</P>
<P>
Any realistic talk of German reunification must take into account Moscow's 
views: East Germany is its key buffer state against the supposed threat from 
the West, and there are 380,000 Soviet troops stationed there to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"The key as ever lies in Moscow," said a diplomat in East Berlin.

BUSH WINS FIRST BATTLE IN WAR ON DRUGS BY GAINING POLITICAL ADVANTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before President Bush decided to put the war on drugs at the top of his 
domestic agenda, some aides tried to warn him off. "They said it was an uphill 
fight and he could get hurt politically," recalled one White House staffer. 
</P>
<P>
But the program Bush unveiled in his nationally televised speech won resounding 
public approval, opinion polls demonstrated, and enabled the President to put 
his Democratic opponents in just the political box that brought them to grief 
with voters in the past. "In the short term this certainly helps Bush," 
conceded Democratic pollster Paul Maslin of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats fought back, mostly by demanding that Bush spend more, and last week 
they claimed to have won a victory of sorts when a tentative agreement was 
reached to increase drug war funding. But no matter what gains Democrats make 
in the funding battle, Bush seems to have a better chance of winning the 
political war in the hustings. 
</P>
<P>
For on this issue, the President appears to have aligned himself with the 
majority of American voters by defining the drug problem the same way they do. 
Bush tailored his proposals, which emphasize stern law enforcement, to protect 
the middle class from the mindless violence of the drug scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Use Changing 
</P>
<P>
What gives this approach its political power is the changing nature of drug 
use. Because it appears to be lessening in the more affluent city neighborhoods 
and in suburbia while the scourge rages unabated in the inner cities, the drug 
problem threatens to polarize Americans along racial and economic lines. 
Indeed, the recent violent eruptions in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of 
Brooklyn and in Virginia Beach suggest that race tensions may already be on the 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is fast becoming what Yale University medical historian David F. 
Musto called "a two-tier problem," with inner-city residents increasingly being 
stigmatized by middle-class Americans as drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"The middle class will become more and more angry about drug use," Musto 
predicted, and thus less likely to support proposals for helping to solve the 
drug problem by improving economic and social conditions in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ominous for Democrats 
</P>
<P>
Politically, such polarization is especially ominous for Democrats. Their party 
has strong ties to the black community and counts on it as an indispensable 
base in its electoral arithmetic. At the same time, the Democrats need white 
votes if they are to regain the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of drugs and crime is being manipulated cynically by the Republican 
Party to get into the racial aspects," complained Democratic pollster Maslin. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans reject such charges of implicit racism. They point out that in his 
introduction to the 154-page booklet setting forth Bush's drug plan, White 
House Office of National Drug Control Policy Director William J. Bennett made a 
point of rejecting a racial approach, declaring: "No inevitable link exists 
between urban life -- however disadvantaged -- and drug use. The majority of 
American city residents -- rich or poor; male or female; black, white or 
Hispanic, well-or poorly educated -- do not take drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the next breath Bennett acknowledged that the fight against drugs is "a 
two-front war": one battle, which is being won, against casual use, mostly by 
the white middle class; and the other, which is being lost, against drug 
addiction among the urban poor. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush went on national television and presented his solution to the drug 
problem with its stress on tight spending -- about $8 billion -- as well as 
tougher law enforcement, it proved popular with the President's white, 
middle-class constituents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Majority Favors Approach 
</P>
<P>
A Washington Post-ABC News survey taken after his speech showed 75% of those 
interviewed approving of the way he is handling the drug problem, up from about 
50% last month. A New York Times-CBS News survey gave the Bush plan a 70% 
favorable rating. 
</P>
<P>
Many voters in the Post survey said they thought Bush should do more. But 
measures they favored, harsher penalties and tougher law enforcement, were 
consistent with Bush's anti-crime approach. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, blacks and other low-income citizens, who are most directly 
afflicted by the problem, wanted more federal funding -- and especially more 
attention to treatment and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
That tends to push Democrats into the position of urging higher spending on 
people many white voters regard as threatening, not objects of sympathy. 
Instead of regarding drug abuse as a social welfare need like health care and 
child care, which Democrats have a good reputation for handling, middle-class 
voters are expected increasingly to see drugs as a crime problem. And crime is 
an area in which voters generally consider Democrats to be weaker than 
Republicans, a point Bush reinforced during the 1988 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
What makes such prospects particularly bitter for Democrats is that until Bush 
tackled the problem in full view of the television cameras, their party 
appeared to have an advantage on the drug issue. As they are quick to point 
out, Democratic congressional leaders last year pushed through the 1988 omnibus 
anti-drug abuse bill, which created the White House Office of National Drug 
Control Policy that Bennett now heads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Forced to Act 
</P>
<P>
The new law also made it difficult for Bush not to confront the drug issue by 
requiring that he submit a national plan for a drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as a result of such efforts, Democrats can cite polling data before the 
speech that showed voters had more confidence in them than in Republicans to 
solve the drug problem. And other polls indicated voters recalled that Bush had 
been more or less in charge of fighting the drug problem as former President 
Ronald Reagan's vice president and agreed he had failed to accomplish much. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Altered Perceptions 
</P>
<P>
But by unveiling his own proposal and putting the prestige of his office behind 
it, Bush seems to have altered these perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats contend that Bush will not be able to sustain his current high 
approval ratings unless he can make significant progress in the drug war -- 
progress they say is unlikely, given what they regard as the inadequacies of 
his program. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether it's a program that really gets at the problem," said 
Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee. "And the 
answer depends on the total level of Uzi shells you find on the street corner 
in your neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
His reference was to the drug-related gun battles and other street crimes that 
take place almost exclusively in the inner cities, not the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbolic Threat 
</P>
<P>
It is true, as Democrats point out, that middle-class citizens feel threatened 
by inner-city crime. But this threat mainly is symbolic and indirect, based on 
impressions conveyed by the news media. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush and his advisers, who showed themselves in the 1988 campaign to be 
masters of creating media impressions favorable to themselves, already have 
begun to make their mark on the drug war. The President has been on television 
regularly, demonstrating his concern over the drug problem to middle-class 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
One day he managed to establish a link to schoolchildren, urging them "not to 
look the other way" if their friends start using drugs, and to reinforce his 
commitment to law and order by flashing the badge of a New York City policeman 
slain in a drug investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush expects to be able to back up the symbols with statistics, 
measuring decline of drug use in accordance with goals set by Bennett. As 
critics point out, the goals seem notably modest, aiming for declines in 
middle-class drug use at a slower rate than was recorded even before Bush 
launched his program. 
</P>
<P>
In their frustration over the issue, Democrats were quick to complain that the 
President's proposals did not go far enough, particularly in the areas of 
treatment and prevention. "The Democrats are taking some risk in going on the 
attack," said A. James Reichley, Brookings Institution specialist in 
presidential-congressional relations. "The public has no great conviction that 
Bush's plan will work. But they think it needs to be tried."

TOM, ABE -- BOTH BEAT HARDSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance it is hard to understand how Mayor Tom Bradley and Abraham 
Spiegel became such close friends because the two men appear to have little in 
common. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's personality is reserved and he has a reputation as a penny pincher. 
Spiegel greets friends effusively and has been known to hand out $5 bills to 
every parking attendant in sight at the City Hall garage. Spiegel can be 
brutally outspoken as well. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's politics are liberal. Like the mayor, Spiegel is a registered 
Democrat, but he holds more conservative views -- once pledging, for example, a 
significant sum toward the Ronald Reagan presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, 71, is the son of Texas sharecroppers. Spiegel's Old World origins are 
evident in his accented English. Born in 1906 -- 11 years before the mayor -- 
Spiegel spent his early years in a village in Czechoslovakia where his family 
owned a lumber mill. 
</P>
<P>
On closer inspection, however, the two are not so different after all. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor, like Abe, is somebody who's overcome tremendous hardships, a . . . 
minority who became successful," said a source close to both Spiegel and 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
When Bradley was in high school, he disregarded the advice given to many blacks 
not to try for college. He was a track star at UCLA, and then went on to a 
career as a police officer, studying law at night and eventually establishing a 
private practice. In 1963, he became the city's first black council member; 10 
years later, he became its first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, a Hebrew scholar, survived the Nazi Holocaust. He tells stories of 
being kept alive by a friend in an Auschwitz kitchen who slipped him raw 
potatoes. Spiegel's wife also lived through the horrors. But their 2-year-old 
son, Uziel, died in the gas chamber in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
After the war ended, Spiegel emigrated and made a fortune building modest tract 
homes in the San Fernando Valley and Orange County. He bought Columbia Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. in 1975. Home is a low, rambling mansion north of Sunset 
Boulevard in Beverly Hills, where Columbia has its headquarters. He also has a 
string of other real estate and investment corporations and partnerships. At 
least twice in recent years, Columbia has leased space in buildings owned by 
Spiegel -- including the glassy new Third and Fairfax Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley resides at Getty House, the mayor's mansion in Hancock Park. His 
personal investments in stocks and bonds -- some of them arranged by Spiegel -- 
and his dealings with local financial institutions have tarnished the mayor's 
once squeaky-clean reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Spiegel consider their friendship very special, according to 
sources close to both men. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it when they greet each other, the feeling of good will and pride in Abe 
Spiegel's eyes," said one source.

USC GOES FOR TWO AND PULLS ONE OUT, 18-17;

MARINOVICH FUELS 91-YARD DRIVE IN LAST 3 1/2 MINUTES, PASSES FOR CONVERSION TO 
BEAT WSU

<P>
USC has had many historic scoring drives in its 100 years of college football. 
Another one made the all-time list Saturday at Martin Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich, a redshirt freshman quarterback, led USC on a 91-yard surge in 
the final 3 1/2 minutes, and the Trojans beat Washington State, 18-17, before 
38,434 fans on an overcast afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich completed two fourth-down passes to keep the drive alive and with 
four seconds left threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Ervins in the left 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
Now for an agonizing decision. Should the Trojans go for the almost automatic 
extra point to salvage a tie, or go for victory? 
</P>
<P>
After calling time out, the first of the drive and the last that USC had, Coach 
Larry Smith chose to try for two points. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich floated a pass to flanker Gary Wellman deep in the end zone. Wellman 
was barely inbounds when he made the catch and then was mobbed by his 
teammates. "Intelligence-wise, we probably should have gone for a tie, because 
in our conference the championship is decided by the fewest loses (a tie 
counting as a half-game won and a half-game lost)," Smith said, "and we only 
play seven conference games. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's called the spirit of competition, and we went for it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, near tears, said his decision was based both on emotion and momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said if the Trojans had scored with five minutes or more remaining, he 
wouldn't have hesitated going for the one-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only sustained drive of the game for the Trojans, who nearly 
self-destructed earlier because of penalties, misjudged punts, a dropped pass 
and an interception, among other errors. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the conference opener for both teams, USC improved to 3-1. 
Washington State (4-1) had been on a nine-game winning streak dating to last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one great drive," Smith said. "There were a lot of heroes out there. 
And we had a quarterback who was hot." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich, who became USC's starting quarterback when Pat O'Hara was injured 
nine days before the season-opening game against Illinois, turned into a 
veteran on the late drive, according to Wellman. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4 quarterback from Capistrano Valley High School completed 11 of 17 
passes on the final drive, including the two-point conversion pass to Wellman. 
</P>
<P>
For the game, he was 27 of 41 for 268 yards. His 27 completions broke the 
school record of 25 set by Paul McDonald against Arizona in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't describe the feeling," Marinovich said. "I had never done it before." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich's uncle, Craig Fertig, led USC on a similar drive to beat Notre 
Dame, 20-17, in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I'll be hearing from Uncle Craig tonight," Marinovich said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's 18-17 score recalled the 1975 Rose Bowl game, when Pat Haden led the 
Trojans to a late victory over Ohio State, throwing a touchdown pass to John 
McKay, the coach's son, and then a two-point conversion pass to Shelton Diggs. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich worked out of a shotgun formation on the last drive, and the plays 
were signaled to him from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Of the conversion pass to Wellman, Marinovich said, "I put a lot of air on the 
ball. I wanted to hold it (the ball) a little longer but I was under pressure, 
so I thought I'd throw it up to see what happened." 
</P>
<P>
What happened was that the 5-9 Wellman ran between two defenders, turned around 
and caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked down at my feet and I was only six inches inbounds," he said. "It was 
a great feeling, and Todd played like a veteran." 
</P>
<P>
Wellman said Ervins was the primary receiver, but the defense converged on the 
tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's State's 17-10 lead, the result of touchdown passes from 
quarterback Aaron Garcia to wide receiver Tim Stallworth and tailback Steve 
Broussard, seemed safe when Rob Myers' punt was downed on the USC nine-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The ball landed at the WSU 45-yard line, and USC strong safety Cleveland Colter 
watched it roll to the nine after mishandling the punt. It was an 81-yard punt. 
</P>
<P>
There was 3:31 to play when Marinovich went to work. He had incompletions on 
three passes and then found Wellman for a 15-yard gain on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wellman and Marinovich said that the Cougar defenders were giving the USC 
receivers a cushion, backing off of them. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich faced still another fourth-down situation at his own 29, five yards 
to go for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback hooked up with split end John Jackson for a seven-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
"They were tired," Marinovich said of the Washington State defensive players. 
"After a few completions, they were huffing and puffing." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich completed two 16-yard passes, one to Joel Scott, a reserve wide 
receiver, and the other to fullback Leroy Holt on third down. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Marinovich completed a seven-yard pass to Jackson before scrambling and 
throwing to Scott for 13 more yards. 
</P>
<P>
With a first down at the WSU 12 and only 46 seconds left, Marinovich went to 
his tight end, Scott Galbraith, for a seven-yard gain to the five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
He threw a pass away under pressure, then, on second down, tossed a short pass 
to Ervins, who scrambled out of bounds at the WSU two-yard line, stopping the 
clock and providing USC with a first down. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown pass to Ervins followed. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the timeout and Smith's decision to go for the win, rather than a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
"Leroy Holt said in the huddle that one man can make a difference," Jackson 
said, meaning that all of the Trojans had to play to their ability. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson had a rewarding day, catching 11 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown. 
His 11 receptions tied a single-game school record held by Fred Hill in 1964 
and Jeff Simmons in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said that USC's stirring finish reminded him of the 1988 Pacific 10 
Conference opening game against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
He caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Rodney Peete with 1:19 remaining to 
give the Trojans a 24-20 victory over the Cardinal. USC drove 80 yards to win 
that game. 
</P>
<P>
As for Saturday's game, the Trojans, two-time defending conference champions, 
had problems containing Washington State's spread-out, one-back, four-receiver 
offense. Also, they were repatedly fooled on clever quarterback draw plays by 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars scored in the first quarter on a 77-yard pass play from Garcia, 
like Marinovich a redshirt freshman, to Stallworth. 
</P>
<P>
USC free safety Mark Carrier lunged at Stallworth's ankles at the 12-yard line, 
but the wide receiver kept on going for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans made it 7-3 in the second quarter on Quin Rodriguez's 33-yard field 
goal. This was matched by Jason Hanson's 23-yard field goal in the same 
quarter. USC earned a 10-10 tie at halftime when Ervins threw an eight-yard 
touchdown pass to Jackson. Ervins had thrown only one pass earlier in his USC 
career and that was an incompletion as a freshman. The 5-foot-8 tailback set up 
the touchdown with a 49-yard run when WSU's blitzing linebackers breezed right 
by him as Ervins accelerated on a counter play. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins had his third straight 100-yard-plus rushing day with 138 yards in 23 
carries for a six-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars came back with another big play early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard was matched up on USC linebacker Scott Ross near the sideline and 
broke to the middle of the field to catch Garcia's pass. Broussard caught it at 
the USC 26-yard-line and scored easily. The play covered 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the 17-10 lead would hold up and that the Cougars would once 
again upset USC in their home area know as the Palouse Country. Washington 
State upset USC, 34-14, here in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For sure, the Trojans were making enough mistakes to provide the Cougars with 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
USC had four personal-foul penalties in the first half, including a 
roughing-the-kicker penalty. Jackson dropped a pass at the WSU five-yard line, 
and the Trojans settled for a field goal in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich threw an interception preceding WSU's second touchdown. Then, in the 
third quarter, Marinovich's 38-yard pass to Wellman that carried to the Cougar 
one-yard line was nullified by an illegal-motion penalty. 
</P>
<P>
And Colter misjudged two punts, depriving USC of advantageous field position. 
</P>
<P>
For Washington's State's positive-thinking coach, Mike Price, the loss was 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had them," he said. "Did anyone else think they could go 80 yards 
(91), or whatever it was for a touchdown with three minutes to go?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

RYAN WINS: STRIKES OUT 13 ANGELS, GETS NO. 301 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only Nolan Ryan can go where no man has gone before, strike out 13 hitters with 
an unprecedented mix of savvy and speed, bring the other team's home crowd to 
its feet in the bottom of the ninth -- and still consider the night a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Nolan Ryan became the oldest man ever to strike out 300 batters in a 
single major league season -- he finished with 301 -- during Texas' 2-0 victory 
over the Angels Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But for 7 1/3 innings, Ryan, three months shy of his 43rd birthday, had been 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two Angels had stepped in against Ryan, all meeting the same fate, 
before Brian Downing, the only member of the 1989 Angels to have played with 
Ryan during his Anaheim years, lined a crisp single into the gap in 
right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette immediately followed with a single to left, and an inning later, 
Mark McLemore also singled to turn Ryan's hope into merely another three-hit 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Disheartened but not dismayed, Ryan collected himself and poured his remaining 
energies into the quest still within reach -- a 300-strikeout season. This 
might have been nothing new for Ryan -- he reeled off five of them in his first 
six seasons with the Angels -- but it was definitely new for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday, Mickey Lolich, at age 31, was the oldest pitcher to have 
struck out 300 batters in a single season, which he did in 1971. Eighteen years 
later, a 42-year-old Ryan was bidding to eclipse that standard, but he entered 
his final start of the season a dozen strikeouts shy of 300. 
</P>
<P>
After singles by Downing and Bichette in the bottom of the eighth inning, Ryan 
was at 297. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he closed out the eighth, Ryan was at 299, coming back to strike 
out Jack Howell and pinch-hitter Jim Eppard. 
</P>
<P>
On to the bottom of the ninth, in which Ryan, buoyed by a crowd of 34,910 that 
had temporarily switched allegiance, squared off against Dick Schofield, the 
Angels' shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield fouled the first pitch back to the screen. Count: 0 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield then took a curveball high. 1 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a checked swing on an outside fastball. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, one more kick by Ryan and one more fastball on the outside corner. 
Schofield leaned toward it and looked at it, but could do nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
Home plate umpire Rocky Roe threw his fist in the air, and there it was. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan, 42 going on 300. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, in his 22nd big league season, got No. 301 when struck out Devon White 
for the second out of the ninth. And how rare a feat is 300 strikeouts? 
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only one other pitcher was able to do it during the 1980s. In 1986, 
Houston's Mike Scott struck out 306. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only two other pitchers were able to do it since Ryan's previous 
300-season, which came in 1977 when he was a callow California Angel of 29. 
Along with Scott, Houston's J.R. Richard did it -- twice -- in 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only 11 pitchers in the history of major league baseball have ever been 
able to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan is the only pitcher to have done it more than three times. 
</P>
<P>
"This just kind of caps off my season," said Ryan, who finished the year with a 
16-10 record and a 3.20 earned-run average. "This year surpassed all my 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"To pitch consistently all year, to strikeout 300 and to win 16 games . . . I 
really didn't anticipate this." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly with Ryan, at long last, beginning to act his age. In his previous 
seven starts, Ryan had gone 1-4, laboring through the late summer heat with an 
ERA of 3.76 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
"The last month or so, I didn't have as much life in my arm as I had the first 
five months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the opportunity to pitch against the Angels one more time apparently 
brought about a revival. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan retired the side seven times in succession Saturday night, and only one of 
his pitches was hit hard. That one, Ryan caught -- a sharp line drive up the 
middle in the fifth inning off the bat of Wally Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan struck out the side in the sixth inning and had a pair of strikeouts in 
both the third and fourth innings. He extended his bid into the eighth, opening 
that inning by retiring Joyner on a fly ball to center. 
</P>
<P>
Next up: Downing, Ryan's old Angel batterymate. Ryan had won this evening's 
first two encounters, getting Downing to foul out and fly out, but the third 
and most critical confrontation ended after one pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to work him up and in," Ryan said, "but I didn't get the ball in 
as much as I wanted. Brian made an adjustment and I think it reflects on the 
quality of hitter he is. 
</P>
<P>
"He went up there just trying to put the ball in play, just trying to hit it up 
the middle, and I gave him too much of the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Downing's single marked the fifth time this season Ryan had taken a no-hitter 
into the eighth inning, only to be denied every time. 
</P>
<P>
But at least on this occasion, there was another plum still to be had. 
</P>
<P>
"After losing the no-hitter, I started thinking about the 300," Ryan said. "I 
was that close and I wanted to get it. 
</P>
<P>
"Letting the no-hitter get away was disappointing, but getting the shutout and 
getting 300 strikeouts still makes it a special night." 
</P>
<P>
Told he was the oldest man ever to strike out 300, Ryan laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to do a lot of these age things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So why is it that the hitters, and not Ryan, are the ones who always look 42? 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan still hasn't said whether he's going to come back for a final season 
in 1990 -- he has scheduled a Monday news conference in Arlington, Tex., to 
announce his plans for next year -- but a close friend reports that Ryan will 
again be on the mound for the Rangers next summer. Jimmie Reese, the Angel 
conditioning coach who turns 84 today, lunched with Ryan Saturday afternoon and 
claims, "I'm sure he'll be back. He intimated as much to me. He's not far from 
300 wins (Ryan has 289) and, you know, you can't overlook the financial end of 
it. A million dollars a year is not exactly hay. He told me, 'The Rangers got 
(a contractual) option on me and they're going to use it.' " . . . Add Reese: 
Ryan not only named his second-born child Reese, but he has also entrusted the 
Angel coach with two of his most prized mementoes. "He gave me the ball he used 
to get his 5,000th strikeout and the ball he used in his fifth no-hitter," 
Reese said. "Everybody wants them, but I tell them, 'See ya later." . . . The 
Rangers made a pitching change for today's season finale. Mike Jeffcoat (9-6) 
will start for Texas, in place of Charlie Hough (10-13), against Kirk McCaskill 
(15-10).

NOLAN RYAN'S 300-STRIKEOUT SEASONS 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan, with 13 strikeouts against the Angels at Anaheim Stadium Saturday 
night, went past the 300 mark for the sixth time in his career. Here are the 
seasons that Ryan has struck out 300 or more batters.

NO TITLE AT STAKE AGAINST SEATTLE, MAYBE MORE FOR SHANAHAN, RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the Raiders, it's never too early to feel the heat. Coach Mike Shanahan 
said they had their backs to the wall -- after the opener -- and once again, 
it's backsides to the bricks. 
</P>
<P>
They take a 1-2 record into today's game against the Seattle Seahawks, who are 
also 1-2, meaning that one of these two great division rivals is going to be 
1-3, which will be a problem even in the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
When the Seahawks came to the Coliseum for the regular season finale last 
season, the AFC West title was on the line and Seattle came away with a 43-37 
victory to win its first division championship. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not it's deserved, there is already intense speculation about 
Shanahan's job stability. Few really know what's on Al Davis' mind, but any 
Raider plummet would need someone to take the fall and Davis isn't expected to 
step up and say it's his fault. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Raiders are still in the soft part of their schedule. Today is 
the only time in the first six weeks they will be playing a team that had a 
winning record, 9-7, last season. Since it's a home game, the Raiders are 1 
1/2-point favorites. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the next two games -- the New York Jets at the Meadowlands, the 
Kansas City Chiefs here -- the Raider schedule gets meaner: at Philadelphia; 
Washington and Cincinnati at home; at San Diego; at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Does Shanahan deserve better? 
</P>
<P>
The Raider decline was well along when he showed up last season. The unit he 
runs, the offense, has made strides and is farther along than the defense, 
which has a new coordinator, a new staff, and for the first time in the 1980s, 
personnel shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
Disquieting signs continue. On last week's telecast of the game in Denver, 
NBC's Bill Walsh repeatedly wondered out loud if Shanahan hadn't gotten his 
first head coaching job at too early an age. Of course, Walsh is another of Al 
Davis' confidantes. 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, Shanahan was 35 when Davis hired him. Davis was 34 when 
the Raiders hired him. 
</P>
<P>
Further decline of the West: 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders aren't the only division power with problems. The Seahawks went 
nine quarters this season before ever leading, lost in the Kingdome to the 
Phoenix Cardinals and needed an upset victory last week at New England to avoid 
a 0-3 start. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it was any masterpiece, either. The Patriots failed twice on third and 
one and twice more on fourth and one, running over the same hole, whereupon new 
owner Victor Kiam braced club official Bucko Kilroy in the press box and was 
overheard asking, "What kind of . . . idiot is calling that?" 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Seahawks won the division title despite ranking No. 26 in 
rushing defense. 
</P>
<P>
This season, they have managed to climb to No. 14. Now, however, their pass 
defense has fallen apart. They started the season with a new secondary, 
including former Ram Johnnie Johnson at safety, but have since waived Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Before last week's game, when it rallied, the secondary was known in Seattle as 
the Four Slices of Toast. Even after a better outing, opposition quarterbacks 
have combined for a 97.6 rating against them. This would be OK if they were 
facing Joe Montana every week, but Randall Cunningham, Gary Hogeboom and Tony 
Eason? 
</P>
<P>
Things could be looking up for the Seahawks, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Boz is gone again. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Brian Bosworth is on injured reserve with a shoulder problem and 
once again the team prospers in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks are 12-12 with him over the last three seasons, 5-2 with 
journeyman Darren Comeaux at his inside linebacker spot. A Seattle TV station 
recently asked viewers what should be done with Boz and 57% said that their 
one-time darling should be traded or released. Coach Chuck Knox recently said 
privately that Bosworth was playing so poorly, he couldn't believe they made 
such a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Williams now splits the carries with Curt Warner but the Seahawks can 
still run the ball -- 157 yards at New England -- and the Raiders have yet to 
prove they can stop anyone. They've allowed 164.3 yards a game, worst in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan said he was cheered by the way the defense played in the second, third 
and fourth quarters at Denver last Sunday, but they'll have to get it going 
earlier today, or face the music. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Mike Shanahan says middle linebacker Jerry Robinson "looks like 
he'll be able to play." It will be the first action for Robinson, who suffered 
a groin pull early in camp. Newly-signed Ricky Hunley may also play. . . . 
Raider center Don Mosebar and guard Steve Wisniewski, who were out last week 
with knee and ankle injuries, respectively, are expected back. Linden King 
moves into Otis Wilson and Emanuel King's old outside linebacker spot, and Mike 
Harden will move up to split time at strong safety with Zeph Lee. . . . The 
Raiders got hit for 247 yards rushing at the Kingdome last season, as both Curt 
Warner and John L. Williams went over 100. The Raiders held them to 101 in the 
division-deciding rematch at the Coliseum, but the Seahawks caught them playing 
the run and passed them dizzy on first down. Dave Krieg rolled up 410 yards, 
passed for four touchdowns, and the Seahawks won, 42-37.

RAMS TRY TO BE TOP BANANA, FACE 49ERS, MONTANA; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S AN EARLY SHOWDOWN FOR NFC WEST LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this season's episode of keeping up with the Joe Montanas, the next-door 
neighbor Rams drop by Candlestick Park one more time to clear up some old 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams swear they had the best-looking lawn on the block last season after 
trouncing San Francisco, 38-16, in the season finale. But everyone keeps 
mentioning weeds. 
</P>
<P>
The game meant nothing because the 49ers clinched the division title moments 
before kickoff when New Orleans defeated Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The game meant everything to the Rams because they needed to win to make the 
playoffs as a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were saving themselves for their three-game sweep to the Super Bowl 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
If only the 49ers were trying. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams once again find it difficult to measure themselves against their 
archrivals because everyone keeps messing with the yardstick. 
</P>
<P>
"Was the 48-0 game hard to gauge because we lost our quarterback and didn't 
have anything to play for," John Robinson said of a humiliating 1987 loss to 
the 49ers. "It doesn't matter. You play. You win or you lose." 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim's small world, every step forward is taken toward San Francisco, 
every exhaled breath directed down the neck of a 49er. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken a new quarterback, Jim Everett, a new offensive coordinator, Ernie 
Zampese, a blockbuster trade, Eric Dickerson, and time for the Rams to get 
within striking distance of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Well? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go find out just how good we are and how good they are," Robinson said 
this week. "It seems to me there's not anybody else who's going to beat these 
guys. If we want them beat, we're going to have to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are talking tough this season for a reason. They've apparently grown 
tired of second class and second place. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all going to go up there and see Sunday," Robinson said. "If we haven't 
caught them by Sunday, we'll catch them in December. And if we don't catch them 
in December, we'll sneak up there in March . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The lines have been drawn for today's battle of National Football League 
unbeatens, although both teams are not without their blemishes. 
</P>
<P>
On their way to 3-0, the Rams have given up points and yardage at a resounding 
clip, yet remain undefeated thanks to a bit of good fortune -- Brent Fullwood's 
goal-line fumble last week -- and an offense that can hold itself up to any in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Irvin returns to right corner this week after serving a 30-day substance 
suspension. Irvin may not handle Jerry Rice any better than the rest of the 
league, but at least he brings 10 years of experience and a few tricks with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the 49ers haven't exactly dazzled the world with a six-point 
victory over Indianapolis and desperate fourth-quarter comebacks against Tampa 
Bay and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
But they do have quarterback Joe Montana, and that has been enough so far. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the 49ers have issued an all-points bulletin for tailback Roger 
Craig, held to 14 yards in eight carries against the Eagles and relegated to 
mop-up blocking against Reggie White, of all things. Craig has been held to 181 
yards in 48 carries thus far, although re-racking the film of last year's 
190-yard performance against the Rams should help some. 
</P>
<P>
Coach George Seifert is so concerned about the run he tossed his offensive line 
like a fruit salad this week, much to the dismay of guard Jeff Bregel, the 
angry crouton who ditched Thursday's practice after learning of his demotion. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been executing some run plays," Seifert said. "We've been beat a 
couple of times and faced a couple defensive teams, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia, 
that play a lot of eight-man fronts. They purposely gang up to take the run 
away and force you to throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't worked out so badly either, although Montana was sacked eight times 
and was one bruised banana after his 425-yard, five touchdown performance 
against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Is this any way to protect a future Hall-of-Fame quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
"They were successful more than we would have wanted," Seifert said of the 
Eagles' pass rush. "And it's a concern again going into this one. You've got a 
fella like (Kevin) Greene coming off the corner; we've got our hands full." 
</P>
<P>
At least Montana kept getting up. Free safety Ronnie Lott, one of the all-time 
Ram bashers, was hobbling on a bad ankle all week and could miss the game, 
although the Rams have always been suspicious of 49er hospital reports. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a whole lot of shaking going on in the Bay Area, yet not one 
peep about Montana's bad back or a quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert's record as coach remains perfect, although he's not ready to OK 
production of back-to-back T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a long ways away from saying we haven't had the post Super Bowl letdown 
yet," Seifert said. "So far, it's turned out our way." 
</P>
<P>
One last memory of last year's game, the one the 49ers supposedly rolled over 
and died in. Or so mentioned New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms, whose team 
needed a Ram loss to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"They say that they didn't have anything to gain," Ram receiver 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ellard said. "But they were bringing everything they could to try and 
shut us down, and yet they knew we were determined to win that game. They saw 
that after a quarter or two and they finally started to slack off and said, 
'OK, let's get our guys get ready for the playoffs.' I'm pretty sure they'd 
have liked to play the spoiler role and put us out of it." 
</P>
<P>
You think so? 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Raider linebacker Matt Millen is backing up Jim Fahnhorst with the 
49ers. . . . The Rams may have to wait until game time to see if left tackle 
Irv Pankey's back is well enough for him to start. If he can't, Robert Cox 
fills in. . . . After a 57-day holdout, two-week roster exemption and a minor 
auto accident, it appears rookie Cleveland Gary might actually make his Ram 
debut today. . . . This is the 49ers' first home game after three in a row on 
the road. . . . No respect dept.: Rams linebacker Kevin Greene, the NFL's 
second-leading sacker last season with 16 1/2, is known as Ken Green in this 
week's league release. . . . In 19 career games against the Rams, Joe Montana 
has thrown for 4,493 yards, 31 touchdowns and completed 65% of his passes with 
only 10 interceptions. . . . It took rookie Frank Stams a while to make the 
change from outside to inside linebacker, but he's adjusted now and the Rams 
expect big things from here on out. . . . Would you believe it? Through three 
games, Greg Bell has 236 more rushing yards than Roger Craig and is averaging 
almost two more yards per carry.

<P>
GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
Denver (3-0) at Cleveland (2-1), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, the AFC's last undefeated team, have been a surprise, especially 
since John Elway hasn't played particularly well except for one half against 
the Raiders. Denver has owned Cleveland, winning their last 10 meetings, 
including the 1986 and 1987 AFC championship games, and scored a 30-7 victory 
last season. The Browns don't figure to find much running room against Denver's 
No. 1-ranked rushing defense, but Bernie Kosar could find some holes against a 
secondary that ranks 23rd. Denver has jumped to leads of 17-0, 21-0 and 28-0 in 
its three victories. 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
San Diego (1-2) at Phoenix (2-1), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals come home after opening with three games on the road. Gary 
Hogeboom and the Phoenix offense looked sharp before running up against the New 
York Giants, but have lost running back Stump Mitchell for the season with a 
knee injury. Jim McMahon got his first victory with the Chargers and tight end 
Rod Bernstine looked like a young Kellen Winslow against Kansas City, which was 
held to 272 yards. San Diego had five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh (1-2) at Detroit (0-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Rodney Peete, recovered from a knee injury, finally gets his first 
regular-season start in the Lions' Silver Stretch offense, which has averaged 
324 yards per game. It will be the first time Detroit's prized rookies, Peete 
and running back Barry Sanders, play together. Pittsburgh's Chuck Noll was 
looking at his first 0-3 start before the Steelers upset Minnesota. Quarterback 
Bubby Brister should exploit Detroit's defense, ranked last in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati (2-1) at Kansas City (1-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
After Steve DeBerg threw five interceptions last week as the Chiefs lost in San 
Diego, Coach Marty Schottenheimer will go with Ron Jaworski, 38, at quarterback 
-- his first start since 1986. The Bengals don't want to switch quarterbacks, 
but may be forced to go with Turk Schonert if Boomer Esiason can't play because 
of an ankle injury. Cincinnati found a replacement for injured Ickey Woods when 
Eric Ball gained 78 yards against Cleveland. Kansas City pulled off a 31-28 
upset of the Super Bowl-bound Bengals last season as Nick Lowery kicked five 
field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis (1-2) at New York Jets (1-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Trudeau came off the bench to lead the Colts past Atlanta last week when 
Chris Chandler suffered a knee injury and was lost for the season. Eric 
Dickerson has a hamstring pull but probably will play. Ken O'Brien, who passed 
for 329 yards last week, led New York to 280 yards and 16 first downs in the 
second half against Miami. Al Toon caught 10 passes. The teams split two games 
last season, each winning at home, the Jets ending the Colts' playoff hopes in 
Week 15. 
</P>
<P>
New England (1-2) at Buffalo (2-1), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots have been sputtering with Tony Eason at quarterback, so Coach 
Raymond Berry has turned to New England's choice, Doug Flutie (6-3 as a starter 
last season). Running back John Stephens will be sidelined for the second week 
because of an ankle injury. Jim Kelly's five touchdown passes pushed the Bills 
past Houston in overtime last week. Buffalo swept the Patriots last season, 
winning both games on field goals by Scott Norwood in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (1-2) at Houston (1-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Marino passed for 429 and three touchdowns but the Dolphins proved again 
that he can't do it by himself in a loss to the New York Jets. Miami ranks No. 
1 in passing, No. 26 in rushing. Mark Duper dropped four Marino passes, two of 
which could have been touchdowns. The Oilers have been falling behind, taking 
their powerful rushing attack out of the game and putting pressure on 
quarterback Warren Moon. Houston's defense is allowing 401 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Washington (1-2) at New Orleans (1-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints have lost consecutive games they figured to win against Green Bay 
and Tampa Bay, and nearly lost both their quarterbacks against the Buccaneers. 
Bobby Hebert went out with a concussion but had to come back when John Fourcade 
sprained an ankle. The Redskins lead the NFL in total offense and held Dallas 
without an offensive touchdown to get their first victory. Washington beat New 
Orleans, 27-24, last season on Chip Lohmiller's late field goal. 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants (3-0) at Dallas (0-3), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants get a chance to make up for past indignities at Texas Stadium, where 
they've won just two of the last 13 games, including a 12-10 victory last 
season. Lawrence Taylor has 25 tackles and 4 1/2 sacks in three games. Dallas 
rookies Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh each threw two interceptions last week with 
little support from Herschel Walker and the rushing game, which ranks last in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay (2-1) at Minnesota (1-2), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ray Perkins will find out how good his Buccaneers are against the 
Vikings, who have never had much trouble with Tampa Bay. Minnesota beat the 
Buccaneers twice and have won eight of nine. The Vikings are smarting after 
being knocked off by Pittsburgh, which controlled the passing tandem of Wade 
Wilson to Anthony Carter. The Vikings cut kicker Teddy Garcia, who missed three 
field goal attempts against Pittsburgh, and signed Rich Karlis. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta (1-2) vs. Green Bay (1-2) 
</P>
<P>
at Milwaukee, 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Don Majkowski will try to get warmed up before the Packers get too far behind 
this week. He has been brilliant in the second half the past two weeks, passing 
for more than 300 yards each game while pulling out an upset of New Orleans and 
falling just short against the Rams. The Falcons also seem improved, but 
couldn't hold a 9-0 lead in the second half against Indianapolis last week when 
quarterback Chris Miller suffered a rib injury that will keep him out three to 
four weeks. Miller's replacement will be Hugh Millen, who passed for only 33 
yards after Miller was injured. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia (2-1) at Chicago (3-0) 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 7, 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka won't answer questions about his feud with former defensive 
coordinator Buddy Ryan even though the Bears are 3-0 against the Eagles since 
Ryan took over in Philadelphia. The Bears knocked the Eagles out of the 
playoffs in the fog last season at Chicago, where the Eagles (0-11) have never 
won. Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers taught a few lessons to Randall 
Cunningham and the Eagles last week. Neal Anderson and Brad Muster give Chicago 
the league's top running game after three weeks.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
SABERHAGEN MAKES HIS BEST PITCH FOR CY YOUNG WITH 23RD VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bret Saberhagen set a club record Saturday with his 23rd victory and clinched 
the American League earned-run average title as the Kansas City Royals beat the 
Athletics, 6-1, at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, who won 14 of his last 15 starts, may have also locked up the 
American League's Cy Young Award while his victory was helping the Royals 
clinch second place in the West. His 23rd victory, against six losses, broke 
the club record set in 1974 by Steve Busby, who went 22-14. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, who allowed only three earned runs in his last 58 innings (0.47 
ERA), ended the season with a 2.16 ERA, best in the majors. The Cy Young winner 
in 1985, when he finished 20-6, Saberhagen allowed four hits in eight innings 
against the A's and struck out a career-high 13. He walked only two. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen's streak of 31 scoreless innings ended when the A's scored in the 
fifth, only the third run in 31 innings this season by Oakland against 
Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw good, one of the best in the league," said Oakland's Dave Parker, who 
struck out three times. "But he's going to rest all winter now." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 2, Minnesota 1 -- Edgar Martinez singled home Jay Buhner with two out 
in the 10th inning at Seattle to give the Mariners the win. 
</P>
<P>
Buhner drew a one-out walk off Jeff Reardon and went to third on two-out single 
by Dave Cochrane. Martinez followed with a ground single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reed (7-7) pitched the 10th for the win after Bill Swift allowed only 
four hits over the first nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota rookie Kevin Tapani had a three-hit shutout entering the bottom of 
the ninth, but Harold Reynolds led off with a single, stole second and went to 
third on Greg Briley's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Kirby Puckett, who entered the game as the American League's 
leading hitter at .340, was hitless in four at-bats to lower his average to 
.33809. Oakland's Carney Lansford is second at .33759. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 3, Boston 1 -- Converted reliever Mark Knudson allowed six hits, all 
singles, in 8 1/3 innings at Boston to beat Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Red Sox hits off Knudson (8-5), making his seventh start of the 
season, were infield singles. No Boston runner reached second base until the 
ninth inning, when Jody Reed and Marty Barrett singled, and Reed then advanced 
to third on a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Dan Plesac gave up a run-scoring single to Mike Greenwell before 
getting the last two outs for his 33rd save. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens (17-11) struck out 10 in his first home loss in seven decisions. 
</P>
<P>
New York 9, Detroit 2 -- The Yankees beat Detroit at New York for the 10th 
straight time, and clinched fifth place in the East in the process, as Alvaro 
Espinoza drove in three runs and Don Mattingly hit a solo home run. 
</P>
<P>
En route to 13 hits, the Yankees sent 10 batters to the plate in the fifth 
inning against Kevin Ritz (4-6), Steve Searcy and Edwin Nunez. They had five 
runs on four doubles, two singles and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 8, Cleveland 2 -- The White Sox may be in last place in the West, but 
the win at Chicago guaranteed they'll finish better than .500 for the second 
half of the season after improving to 37-35 since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
With an assist from Manager Don Zimmer, Chicago's Ryne Sandberg tied the major 
league record for second basemen with his 89th consecutive errorless game, 
equaling the mark set by Manny Trillo of Philadelphia, as the Cubs beat the 
Cardinals, 6-4, at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg has played only one inning in each of the last three games. Zimmer 
said his star will do the same today in the regular-season finale as the Cubs 
prepare to meet San Francisco in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say one thing," Zimmer said. "Anybody that says that is a cheap record is 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy has played in every inning of every game for six years. I think he's 
entitled to the fielding record." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dascenzo's ninth-inning RBI single broke a 4-4 to give the Cubs the win, 
after they blew a 4-1 lead in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 9, Cincinnati 2 -- Glenn Davis hit a two-run home run, and Jose Cano, a 
27-year-old right-hander, scattered seven hits for his first major league 
victory in the Astros' win at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
New York 7, Pittsburgh 2 -- The Mets scored five times in the 11th inning, 
highlighted by Kevin McReynolds' bases-loaded single, to win at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Myers (7-4) got the win despite allowing the Pirates to tie the score, 
2-2, in the bottom of the ninth. Bill Landrum (2-3) got the loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates had a streak of 25 innings without scoring an earned run before 
Dann Bilardello had a home run in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 11, San Francisco 5 -- Tony Gwynn went three for four to reach 200 
hits in a season for the fourth time in his career and narrow the National 
League batting race in the Padres' victory at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, who entered the game with 197 hits, raised his average from .331 to 
.333. He is pursuing San Francisco's Will Clark, who singled in four at-bats to 
remain at .334. 
</P>
<P>
With a double, Gwynn drove in the first of four runs in a fifth-inning rally, 
which broke a 4-4 tie against Rick Reuschel (17-8). Reuschel allowed eight 
runs, including Sandy Alomar Jr.'s first career homer, in tuning up for his 
start Thursday in the National League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6, Montreal 3 -- Bruce Ruffin allowed three runs in seven innings 
and Dickie Thon's two-run triple sparked a three-run fourth inning at 
Philadelphia as the Phillies sent the Expos to their fourth consecutive loss 
and ninth in 12 outings.

EVEN WITHOUT GRETZKY, KINGS DEFEAT OILERS, 5-3; 
</P>
<P>
STAR SIDELINED AFTER DENTAL WORK, BUT L.A. STILL GETS UP FOR EXHIBITION GAME 
</P>

Coach Tom Webster of the Kings was saying Saturday night that he planned to 
treat today's exhibition game against the Winnipeg Jets in San Diego the same 
as a league game, seeing as how it is the last practice run. 
</P>
<P>
But, then, he had to acknowledge that the players on the ice at the Forum 
Saturday night had treated the game at hand with seriously, which the Kings 
won, 5-3, before 12,075. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, all of our exhibition games have had that kind of intensity," 
Webster said. "What we have seen is that every team is geared up for us. 
They're giving us their best. There will be no easy games for us this year." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had planned to send their best against the Oilers, but Wayne Gretzky 
had to scratch. 
</P>
<P>
News that Gretzky wouldn't play was booed at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who spent four hours at his dentist Friday afternoon having caps on 
his front teeth removed, having his gums treated and having the caps replaced, 
was able to skate with the team Saturday morning but did not feel up to playing 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Gosselin was in goal for the Kings and stopped 31 of the 34 shots he 
faced. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings led, 2-1, after the first period. Glenn Anderson gave the Oilers the 
early lead, but Steve Duchesne tied with a goal at 12:10 of the first period, 
skating through the right circle and beating close-up at the right post. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fox put the Kings ahead at 14:21, surprising Ranford with a quick shot 
through the slot. 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli stretched the Kings' lead to 3-1 early in the second period, 
waiting at the right post to knock in a pass from Bernie Nicholls on the power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls had left the game with 18 seconds remaining in the second period after 
getting a five-minute penalty and for delivering an elbow that injured Martin 
Gelinas. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the time left on his penalty at the start of the third period 
that Craig Simpson scored the Oilers' power play goal to close the gap to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kasper gave the Kings a two-goal lead with on a pass from Tonelli at 
16:07. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Oilers skating with six men to the Kings' four (a two-minute 
penalty on Marty McSorley for hooking before the Oilers pulled their goalie) 
Esa Tikkanen cut the lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Sykes scored on the empty net. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The last game of the Kings' exhibition season will be played tonight in San 
Diego. The game against the Winnipeg Jets will begin at 7:05 and will be 
broadcast on KLAC (570). The Kings will go into the game with a preseason 
record of 4-4-2. . . . Dave Taylor, who has been out with a pinched nerve in 
his neck, skated Saturday morning and said Saturday night that he expected to 
be able to play in the season opener Thursday. . . . Barry Beck played one 
shift Saturday night before heading for the dressing room with an aggravated 
groin injury. . . . The Kings, who reported to training camp in Hull Sept. 7 
and returned on Friday were on the road for 22 days.

WATCHING A SEASON WASH OUT; 
</P>
<P>
BUT DODGER WETTELAND CAN SMILE AS A STORM ENDS HIS ROOKIE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As his rookie season was being officially washed away Saturday, Dodger pitcher 
John Wetteland still showed his best stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland stood outside the dugout at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and signed 
autographs in the pouring rain. 
</P>
<P>
"Wasn't it supposed to be Fan Appreciation Day here?" he asked before the 
Dodgers and the Atlanta Braves were rained out for a second consecutive day. 
"Well, I wanted to tell the fans that somebody appreciates them." 
</P>
<P>
There was much appreciation in both clubhouses for the guy in charge of the 
weather, because two consecutive postponements meant that only two of three 
games in this meaningless final series can be played. If that many. 
</P>
<P>
As a simple rainstorm escalated into flash-flood warnings, with no let-up in 
sight, the Braves rescheduled Saturday's doubleheader for today at 10 a.m., 
PDT. The Dodgers will use the pitchers scheduled for the first two games in 
this series, Fernando Valenzuela and Orel Hershiser. That means today's 
scheduled pitcher, Wetteland, has made his last start. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature has denied me," he said. "It's a shame, too. I was just putting 
things together. I would have liked to see how it all came out." 
</P>
<P>
After two consecutive fine performances against National League West champion 
San Francisco (five runs in 12 2/3 innings), Wetteland finished at 5-8 with a 
3.77 ERA. Perhaps more important, he also finished one wild pitch behind the 
club record of 17 set by Sandy Koufax in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's good I didn't have a shot at that record," Wetteland said. "Who 
knows, they get a guy on first and we have a five-run lead and I uncork one . . 
. somebody might get suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland, who will join the Dodgers' Licey squad in the Dominican Republic on 
Oct. 15, isn't upset about getting the extra rest. He said that since his start 
Monday in Los Angeles, his shoulder has been sore. But he said he didn't 
require medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably just slept on it wrong," he said. "I'm not even going to think 
about it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Both Wetteland and Ramon Martinez ended their seasons with impressive victories 
over the Giants. Combined, they accounted for a 3.48 earned-run average with 
185 strikeouts and 75 walks in 201 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Whether those arms will be together again next season is another matter. It's 
not likely, as the Dodgers will probably be forced to trade one to acquire the 
centerfielder-leadoff hitter they need. 
</P>
<P>
'I don't take anything for granted," Wetteland said. "Even when I came up from 
the minor leagues this year (May 31), I kept wondering about going back down. 
Nothing in this game has surprised me. And nothing will surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
Which is the same way the Dodgers and their fans have come to think about him. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ellie DeLury, 56, wife of longtime Dodger traveling secretary Bill DeLury, died 
Saturday morning at their Monterey Park home after an extended illness. Funeral 
arrangements are pending. DeLury, who now works in the Dodger ticket office, 
handled the Dodger travel plans for 10 seasons. . . . The first game of today's 
doubleheader will match the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser (14-15) against the Braves' 
Marty Clary (4-3). The second game will pit Fernando Valenzuela (10-13) against 
Gary Eave (2-0). Originally, the Dodger probables were the same as Saturday's, 
with Valenzuela pitching the first game, but they were switched because 
Hershiser and his family need to catch an early-evening flight to Vero Beach, 
Fla., where he will spend most of the winter. Hershiser needs four innings to 
tie Cincinnati's Tom Browning for the National League lead in innings pitched 
(249 2/3). Valenzuela needs 3 1/3 innings to reach 200 innings.

MAKE NO MISTAKE, BRUINS, BEARS MAKE PLENTY OF ERRORS

<P>
Saturday marked the 60th meeting between the UCLA and California football 
teams, so to celebrate, a punter passed (it was incomplete) and a center punted 
(another player, not the ball). 
</P>
<P>
Cloaking themselves in the spirit of such a festive occasion were the Bruins. 
They had 12 players on the field one play, 10 players on the field another 
play, thus offering conclusive proof of what's really wrong with them. 
</P>
<P>
They can't count. 
</P>
<P>
But they can beat Cal, which UCLA accomplished for the 18th consecutive year, 
24-6, before 50,183 at the Rose Bowl, who surely must have been surprised by 
what they witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
Four games into the season, the Bruins and the Golden Bears unveiled a nouveau 
brand of football. They seemed to be saying, "If we can't play this game great, 
then we'll play it downright quirky." 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, this was what UCLA center Frank Cornish was thinking when he was 
ejected after the first play of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 3-0, the Bruins had just driven from their 34-yard-line to the Cal 
one, where on third and goal, quarterback Bret Johnson fumbled the ball into a 
pile of players. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Oliver, Cal's right cornerback, wound up at the bottom of the pile, with 
his hands on the football and a foot in his, well, rear. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver picks up the story: "Me and a UCLA guy, both of us had our hands on the 
football. We was wrestling for it. What (Cornish) did, he walked behind me and 
kicked me in my butt." 
</P>
<P>
What did you think about that? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's necessarily classy," Oliver said. "But sometimes, your 
emotions run wild." 
</P>
<P>
In the official Cornish version of what happened, he did not want his emotions 
to run, just to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was trying to do was to get off the ground after lying there about 10 
minutes . . . to get out from under about 20 guys," Cornish said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the most comfortable position to be in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Uncomfortable? After playing football to Cornish's foot, Oliver can tell you 
about uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"He just got upset and kicked me in the behind," Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
Although UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said his starting center deserved to be 
ejected if Cornish was indeed guilty, he said he isn't totally sure Cornish did 
it. Donahue said he will have to look at the game films. 
</P>
<P>
Cal, which had a receiver run out of the end zone and then sneak back in to 
catch a pass, an illegal move, was apparently just warming up. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Bears trailed, 7-3, but their second-quarter drive was kept alive 
when UCLA had 12 players instead of 11 on the field when Cal was forced to punt 
from its 26-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
So, Cal kept the ball. Minutes later, its coach, Bruce Snyder, received a 
warning from referee Pat Flood for stepping on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, pleading guilty, said: "That was me, all right, out there complaining 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, UCLA held Cal at the Bruin 48, where on fourth down, punter Robbie 
Keen was summoned. Everyone expected a nice, normal punt. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise! Keen took a step and a half forward and launched a pass for the goal 
line. Unfortunately, it didn't get far enough. The ball looked as if it had 
gone flat as it approached startled punt returner Shawn Wills. 
</P>
<P>
What had happened was a trick play. Keen, a quarterback in high school, was 
supposed to loft it high enough that Darrin Greer, who was in disguise on punt 
coverage, could grab it. 
</P>
<P>
There were other options. Wills could catch it, get tackled, and then it's as 
good as a punt. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe somebody would block Greer, thinking he was coming down to cover the punt 
return, while the ball was in the air. That would be pass interference. But 
because UCLA had only 10 men on the field, nobody blocked Greer. 
</P>
<P>
What happened may go down as a classic: 
</P>
<P>
(1) Keen threw too far. "I surprised myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
(2) Wills never knew it was a pass. He waved his arms and signaled for a fair 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
(3) Nobody caught the ball. It fell incomplete, too far from Greer, and UCLA 
got the ball two yards from midfield with 2:23 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
(4) Johnson drove UCLA to a touchdown and a 14-3 lead 20 seconds before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, it was a brilliant maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst that can happen is what happened," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said it was a great play, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It cost them 45 yards of field position," he said. "When it works, it's a 
great move. But when it falls incomplete, you wish you had punted." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that if Keen had thrown the ball better, it would have been a 
touchdown. But he didn't, and it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the Cal-UCLA series moves into its seventh decade next year. If 
nothing else, it's a fun show.

KANSAS STATE'S WINLESS STREAK ENDED AT 30

Tears of joy streamed down the face of the quarterback whose last-second 
touchdown pass ended the longest losing streak in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, fellas, but I'm still kind of emotional," said Carl Straw of Kansas 
State. "But, for the rest of my life, no matter what happens, I don't know what 
could ever be a greater feeling than this." 
</P>
<P>
Straw guided the Wildcats 85 yards in nine plays and threw a 12-yard touchdown 
to Frank Hernandez with no time left, lifting the Wildcats past North Texas, 
20-17, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It snapped the Wildcats' 30-game winless streak and 16-game losing skid, both 
the longest in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. The Wildcats (1-3) hadn't 
won a game since beating Kansas, 29-12, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the drama was the timing of the go-ahead touchdown by North Texas. On 
fourth-and-19 with 1:35 left, the Eagles took a 17-14 lead on a 47-yard 
touchdown pass from Scott Davis to Carl Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
North Texas came into the game tied with Eastern Kentucky for the No. 1 ranking 
in Division I-AA.

THIS SWEDE IS A SWEET DOUBLES PLAYER, BUT SINGLES GAME IS SOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Bonk 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The line of succession among Sweden's tennis stars had been drawn long ago, for 
all to see. After Bjorn Borg, after Mats Wilander, but before Stefan Edberg, 
there was Anders Jarryd. 
</P>
<P>
Jarryd, the craggy faced native of Lidkoping, was 23 years old in 1985 when he 
reached the semifinals at Wimbledon -- and lost to eventual champion Boris 
Becker. Buoyed by his fine showing at Wimbledon, Jarryd's ranking reached No. 5 
two weeks later that July. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Jarryd has sunk like a stone in singles -- he's No. 53 now -- and 
at age 28, he not only isn't his country's top player, but instead shares 
billing with John Fitzgerald of Australia as one half of one of the world's top 
doubles teams. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Jarryd? He said there is a simple answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play so well, really," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for one notable exception -- the 1986 WCT Finals -- Jarryd has been 
winless in singles since March of 1985. Jarryd and Edberg won the bronze medal 
at Seoul and although Jarryd has continued to be a great doubles player, it is 
singles that establishes and maintains reputations. 
</P>
<P>
There are some who expect Jarryd to make a comeback in singles and climb up the 
rankings again, but he does not sound as confident. 
</P>
<P>
"I only want to try to get my ranking back," he said. "I'm happy with that." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when Jarryd's ranking was still as high as No. 15, he underwent his 
third knee surgery to repair cartilage. Jarryd's knee is all right, it's just 
that his attitude about tennis needs some work. 
</P>
<P>
A killer instinct? Not the way he talks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things . . . sometimes it's difficult to get psyched up," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And my family (girlfriend Lotta Sundren, 1 1/2-year-old son Niklas), I want to 
be home sometimes," he said. "Tennis is not everything for me right now. I 
still like it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not discouraged or anything, because tennis has given me so much. I've 
seen the world, made money, met a lot of people. It would be nice to win a 
Grand Slam title, but there aren't too many players who can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Until Jarryd gets that Grand Slam singles title (he has won five in doubles), 
he said he will continue to enjoy traveling around the world, just as he has 
for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has been giving me so much," Jarryd said. 
</P>
<P>
Incredible Hulks? According to No. 24-ranked Kevin Curren, the trend in tennis 
is for bigger bashers, who with new rackets are altering the style of the game 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
Curren said rackets are getting lighter, more powerful and more artificial 
because of the material used in making them, which means that players who stay 
back and hit the ball as hard as they can produce more upsets than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Russian Roulette out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to see a guy like McEnroe come around anymore, a guy with all 
that finesse. That day is over." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain Michael Chang's success, Curren pointed out that the 
17-year-old's best result was on clay at the French Open in June. "Michael 
Chang has got great speed and a lot of concentration, but he's starting to get 
beat some." 
</P>
<P>
If tennis is going to the power brokers, Chang has missed the trend. He said 
tennis is fair, no matter what the size. As for his own build, the 5-foot-8 
Chang said he's happy with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm a small guy," he said. "I don't think I'm a stick or 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Add Hulks: "Tennis is a great equalizer," Chang said. "If they raise the nets a 
little, it might be different." 
</P>
<P>
He needs a vacation after his vacation: Aaron Krickstein had a busy five days, 
beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After enjoying his victory over Chang in the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament 
final, Krickstein awoke Monday to the news his ranking had improved from No. 16 
to No. 12. He flew Tuesday to Boca Raton, Fla., and from there to Paradise 
Island in the Caribbean. Then it was back to Boca Raton, where he got a quick 
lesson on serves from coach Tim Gullikson, and from there, on to his parents' 
home in Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein left Friday for Basel, Switzerland, where he will play another 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Krickstein said winning the Volvo/Los Angeles title meant a great deal to 
his son's confidence. It was Krickstein's first victory in a Super Series, or 
important tournament, in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's certainly not afraid of anybody anymore," the elder Krickstein said. 
"That was not the case a year or so ago. 
</P>
<P>
"How high can he get? I think he can be in the top five. But I'm his father. 
I'm prejudiced." 
</P>
<P>
When 13-year-old Jennifer Capriati was given the green light to turn pro before 
her 14th birthday, one of those who spoke in her favor was Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, to whom Capriati has been compared, was the only Women's International 
Tennis Assn. board member who voted last year to allow the Florida teen-ager to 
play selected pro events. Capriati had to wait for her chance, which will come 
sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the women's tennis pro council agreed with a new WITA board decision 
that will allows teens to play beginning in the month of their 14th birthday. 
Capriati, who turns 14 on March 28, can play in the Virginia Slims of Florida, 
March 5-11, and the Lipton International Players Championships, March 16-25. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, of Lauderhill, Fla., won the French Open and U.S. Open junior titles 
this year. She told Jim Sarni of the Fort Lauderdale News that she was happy 
with last week's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait," Capriati said. "I'm glad the decision was made because I want 
to play my first tournament in Florida. I want to play Steffi Graf in the first 
round or I want to play Chris. I want to play a top-ranked player to see how I 
do against them." 
</P>
<P>
Many expect her to do pretty well, although Capriati's best will probably come 
later. Evert, 32, may play in the Virginia Slims of Florida, even though she 
announced her retirement from major tournament tennis at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Courting Capriati: Capriati has been doggedly pursued by the Big 3 of tennis' 
management companies. Who has the inside track? It's IMG and John Evert, Chris' 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cross America: Evert's exhibition tour with Martina Navratilova stopped 
in Denver and Seattle last week. Then they took off for Tokyo, where they join 
Pam Shriver and Zina Garrison on the U.S. Federation Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California sectional tennis championships will be played Friday 
through Oct. 15 at the Racket Centre of Universal City. Expected to be among 
the top men's players are Dexter MacBride of Calabasas, a teaching pro; 
Pepperdine freshman Alejo Mancisidor of Palm Springs and UC Irvine sophomore 
Mike Roberts of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Joyce, an 11th-grader at St. Monica's High School, and Matt Holt, a 
freshman at Pepperdine from Larkspur, are also expected to be in the running 
for honors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the top women who will compete are 1988 champion Shandra Livingston of 
Carson and runner-up Noelle Porter of Chatsworth, teaching pro Helen Park Bates 
of Pasadena and juniors Anne Mall of Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
A rising star on the men's tournament circuit, there is an impressive entry 
list for the $1.3 million Paris Open Indoor tournament, which next year becomes 
a $2 million event. So far, top 10 players Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, John 
McEnroe, Michael Chang, Brad Gilbert, Tim Mayotte, Jakob Hlasek and Alberto 
Mancini have entered the event, Oct. 30-Nov. 5. Others who will play are Jay 
Berger, Yannick Noah, Aaron Krickstein, and Miloslav Mecir. . . . This year's 
Nabisco Masters tournament, Nov. 28-Dec. 3, will be the last, because it 
disappears in the new ATP Tour. Replacing the 19-year-old Masters in 1990 is 
the ATP World Championship, which will be held 1990-92 in Frankfurt, West 
Germany. . . . The men's top 10 last week was No. 1 Ivan Lendl, No. 2 Boris 
Becker, No. 3 Stefan Edberg, No. 4 John McEnroe, No. 5 Michael Chang, No. 6 
Brad Gilbert, No. 7 Andre Agassi, No. 8 Tim Mayotte, No. 9 Jakob Hlasek and No. 
10 Alberto Mancini. New rankings come out Monday.

1 KILLED, 7 WOUNDED DESPITE ANTI-GANG SWEEPS BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was slain early Saturday in Pacoima and seven people were wounded -- 
including a 12-year-old boy -- in gang-related shootings this weekend, despite 
a massive street sweep of gang members by Los Angeles police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang task force, dubbed Operation 
Hammer, arrested 472 people in all -- 288 of them reputed gang members -- in a 
crackdown that began Friday evening and continued into the early morning hours 
Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of officers from police divisions in East Los Angeles, the Mid-City 
area, the San Fernando Valley and other stations participated in the latest in 
a series of periodic sweeps aimed at controlling street violence. 
</P>
<P>
But despite those efforts, gang-related warfare still flared over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported that one apparent gang member was shot and killed Saturday 
about 2:45 a.m. as he stood on a Pacoima sidewalk, less than an hour after the 
task force had ceased operations for the day. The victim was reportedly hit in 
the head by a bullet from a passing car and was pronounced dead at the scene. 
No arrests had been made, Lt. Maurice Rubio of Foothill Division said. 
</P>
<P>
At least six people were also wounded in gang-related shootings, including a 
12-year-old boy who was shot in the back in the South-Central Los Angeles area. 
He was left paralyzed from the waist down, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was walking in the 1200 block of East 41st Street just before 
midnight Friday when he was shot by several gunmen in a passing car. "They 
yelled out their gang affiliation and fired several rounds at the youth walking 
down the street," said Lt. Ron Code of the Newton Division who added that the 
victim is in critical condition and that no arrests had been made. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, in Hollywood, two officers on patrol witnessed another 
drive-by shooting as three gunmen armed with shotguns opened fire on a rival 
gang member in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers chased the speeding car on the Hollywood Freeway, and after 
stopping it, they arrested four juveniles, said Sgt. C. E. Tave of Hollywood 
Division. The unidentified victim was hit in the arm, buttocks and foot by 
shotgun pellets but refused medical treatment, Tave said. 
</P>
<P>
In other weekend incidents: 
</P>
<P>
* An unidentified woman was wounded in the chest late Friday in Koreatown in a 
drive-by shooting that police are investigating as gang related. 
</P>
<P>
* A 22-year-old gang member was hit by gunfire from a passing car early 
Saturday in the Mid-City area, Wilshire Division police said. 
</P>
<P>
* And outside the city of Los Angeles, 18-year-old Mario Escalante of Bell -- a 
reported gang member -- was wounded in the hip when he emerged from a bowling 
alley in Huntington Park and four shots were fired from a car, Sgt. Mike Leinen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made in any of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
During their weekend sweep, however, task force officers did arrest five gang 
members, including four juveniles, as suspects in the Friday shooting of two 
teen-agers in North Hollywood. The victims, who apparently had no gang ties, 
were gunned down on a street by a pickup truck full of gang members, police 
said. Both survived the shootings and have been hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Hammer, which began in January, 1988, targets gang members for arrest 
for minor violations or felonies. Police said 106 gang members arrested Friday 
and Saturday were booked for felonies. The majority of those arrested were 
booked for various misdemeanors, including drunk driving, narcotics possession 
and warrants for failure to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Police also reported seizing 11 guns from gang members during the operation. 
</P>
<P>
In another drive-by shooting Saturday afternoon, police said an unidentified 
Latino man in his mid-20s died after he was gunned down in the Union Avenue 
section of Los Angeles. But Sgt. John Wickham of Rampart Division said the 
death did not appear to be gang related. "We think it may have been some other 
kind of criminal activity involved," he said, "but not gang related."

Fountains of lava spewed Saturday from a new crater on Mt. Etna and sent a 
red-hot river of lava flowing down the eastern slope of Europe's most active 
volcano. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the lava gushed from a 500-foot crater that opened 8,500 feet 
up the mountain after a series of tremors on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
News reports said the river of lava was 15 yards wide and had snaked down to 
the 4,500-foot level, still oozing forward at about 10 yards an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Etna began its latest eruption on Sept. 11.

HOW JAPAN STACKS UP; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN WRITERS FIND VOLUMES OF HEARTBREAK AND JOY

" 'It's not easy to arrive in a new country and feel comfortable . . . ' Alec 
said. 'Not that easy for me, anyway. Not here, where things are so different. I 
mean, I knew it would be different. But it's . . . ' He paused. Nothing came to 
him. 'I don't know. It's just really different.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Bicycle Days," by John Burnham Schwartz 
</P>
<P>
According to the Japan National Tourism Organization, 516,259 Americans visited 
Japan last year. By most indications, a good many of them wrote books about the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as this literary tsunami sloshes up on America's shores, reviewers are 
beginning to compare Tokyo to Paris in the 1920s and '30s: It is becoming the 
hip place to go and consider the meaning of life. 
</P>
<P>
There are differences, though, between Gertrude Stein's Lost Generation and the 
one slurping sake and noodles in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Paris, for example, was mere background for the Hemingway crowd's moveable 
feast of the mind. The new expatriates make Japan a main course. Confronted 
with such an odd cultural 
</P>
<P>
and literal cuisine, many of them leave the country with something akin to 
intellectual indigestion. 
</P>
<P>
Times, too, have changed. Ernest Hemingway, for instance, went abroad as an 
ambulance driver, wanna-be bullfighter and budding knockabout. John Burnham 
Schwartz, whose novel "Bicycle Days" is the latest expatriate effort to hit 
America, went to Tokyo as a budding investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
"I hold this romantic notion that people went to Paris wanting to write and 
wanting to be Writers. I think that the times are different and we are 
different," Schwartz said of the new expatriates. "We don't see ourselves as a 
movement. We see ourselves as individuals going to Japan to take a good job. 
And then we write about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spiritual Pilgrimages 
</P>
<P>
Western fascination with Japan is hardly a new phenomenon. As recently as 30 
years ago, Beat poets such as Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg made pilgrimages 
to the land of the rising sun to seek spiritual satori. 
</P>
<P>
But the new seekers are more interested in the wisdom of Sony and Suzuki than 
the sound of one hand clapping. For these poets, novelists and nonfiction 
writers, Japan -- the land of economic miracles, the land of the future -- is a 
Zen koan: a deep, contradictory riddle to be pondered and meditated upon until 
it offers up some transcendental truth. 
</P>
<P>
Poet Mary Jo Salter found in Japan "a strangeness that almost defied writing 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Explains Michael Shapiro whose "Japan, In the Land of the Broken-Hearted" was 
released earlier this year, "It doesn't add up. It looks like home but it's not 
like home, looks like the West but isn't at all like the West. It's an entity 
unto itself. Were it not so important, so strong, it would be a quaint place 
that's overlooked. But the fact is, it can't be overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attractive Contradictions 
</P>
<P>
These contradictions are part of the attraction, he said. "It's so hard. Every 
time you think you've got your hands around it . . . something happens that 
either mesmerizes you -- Mt. Fuji emerges from the clouds, for instance -- or 
repels you. 
</P>
<P>
"So it remains mysterious. These are the qualities that writers look for in 
characters," Shapiro said, "And my God, this is a country." 
</P>
<P>
But the inability to get a solid grip on what one is grappling with can be 
maddening. Reduced to excessive simplicity, Westerners who land in Japan tend 
to split into two factions, the Japan bashers and the Japan lovers, whom 
Shapiro terms enthusiasts, or "Chrysthanthemums." 
</P>
<P>
Some people can maintain the feelings they bring to Japan against all 
contradictions. Others, initially infatuated, become disillusioned when the 
aura of freshness wears off -- for them and their hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro, who puts himself somewhere in between, tracks the "enthusiast" strain 
back 100 years to Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote 11 books about Japan and the 
Japanese, falling in and out of love with the country over the course of his 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was in love, he wrote lavish, rapturous prose," Shapiro explains in 
"Brokenhearted." "But when he was disappointed, he railed, and his damning 
attacks were of the sort punctuated by veins protruding in the forehead and 
occasional sprays of spittle." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slight Restraint 
</P>
<P>
The real or fictional gaijin (foreigners) in the new expatriate books are only 
slightly more restrained as they immerse themselves in the culture, as if into 
the progression of increasingly hot tubs at Japan's public baths. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by sake and beer and surging hormones, the expatriates find initial 
impressions clattering through their Western minds like a hailstorm of pachinko 
balls: 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese eat weird stuff for breakfast! 
</P>
<P>
 The fruit is more expensive! 
</P>
<P>
 Girls hide their mouths when they giggle! 
</P>
<P>
 They confuse their English r's and l's! 
</P>
<P>
 Children point at gaijin and shout 'Herro! Herrro!' 
</P>
<P>
 They work 14 hours a day! 
</P>
<P>
 Then drink themselves silly then get up and sing! 
</P>
<P>
 Their subway system works! 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, though, the authors begin to look beyond Tokyo's neon sheen, 
checking things out not just as gaijin -- but as individuals, peering through 
lenses tinted with their own romanticism or cynicism. But the act of observing 
is complicated by cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Down to the conception of the individual, you're constantly dealing with 
different structures of perception," said David Mura, a 37-year-old 
Japanese-American, who spent a year in Japan on a fellowship and completed a 
book of poetry there. As a result, gaijin constantly find themselves saying, " 
'I have to shift perspectives.' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Idealized Vista 
</P>
<P>
In Jay McInerney's 1985 novel "Ransom," the namesake character goes out of his 
way to avoid the local McDonald's, because, a young woman chides, it spoils his 
"idealized Japanese vista -- pagodas and misty mountains." 
</P>
<P>
On street corners, though, he runs into men holding shopping bags that read, in 
English: "Groovy Cat: Guys tough, check out the scene, love to Dancing with 
Funky Babes." 
</P>
<P>
In Brad Leithauser's "Equal Distance," perhaps the most critically acclaimed 
work of fiction produced by the new expatriates, two Americans from similar 
backgrounds perceive Japan from disparate perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
Danny, a law student, struggles to meet the country on its own terms. Greg, a 
self-proclaimed, " '80s-style Hemingway expatriate (" . . . which means I still 
drink too much but I don't box and I don't suffer in silence") sees Japan as "a 
humorous mirror . . . a country that beats America in a one-on-one Crassness 
Competition, in Mammon-chasing, in the pursuit of ugliness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Litter in Gutter 
</P>
<P>
In "Pictures from the Water Trade," John David Morley's autobiographical 
character, Boon, sees an old woman removing litter from a gutter with 
chopsticks and suddenly adopts a pointillist view. 
</P>
<P>
"Discarding those large-scale expectations which the city failed to live up to, 
he set about exploring Tokyo with the old lady's chopsticks. He ignored the 
general and searched for the particular, in time discovering that for the loss 
of a spectacular urban panorama he was richly compensated by an inexhaustible 
fund of detail. It was a city made interesting solely by its people, customs 
and the terrific vitality of its street life." 
</P>
<P>
Befriended by a wealthy Japanese businessman, Boon finds himself with an entree 
into the Japanese "water trade," the realm of bars and brothel-like 
establishments that he and most of his expatriate brethren find at once 
inviting and bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
Boon wrestles with Japan with an academic intensity. He finds insights in the 
work of Japanese psychologists and in the practice of Japanese calligraphy. 
Ultimately, though, Japan's essence eludes him, as it does most of those who 
try to pin it down in writing. A disenchantment sets in, when he perceives that 
the kindnesses extended to him as a gaijin, are "hollow, a masquerade." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Racial Wall 
</P>
<P>
Mura said that he didn't run up against the racial wall some gaijin face. But 
he did see it. Another friend, a third-generation Japanese-American, or Sansei, 
was introduced to some Japanese farmers by a Caucasian who had been working 
with the Japanese for 
</P>
<P>
three years and spoke the language fluently. The farmers took aside the Sansei, 
who spoke little Japanese, and confided that they felt closer to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans and Europeans occupy a slot as foreigner," Mura said. "It takes . . 
. a special individual to become part of fabric of Japanese life." 
</P>
<P>
Few do. Shapiro, for one, distinguishes himself from the brokenhearted expats 
he writes about because he sees that the problem is his own: "Some get terribly 
embittered (and wonder) why don't they accept me? The answer is, because they 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Why isn't Japan a free-trader? Because it isn't. Why isn't it a real 
democracy? Because it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Leila Phillips lived from 1983 to 1986 in the southern Japanese village of 
Miyama, where she apprenticed herself to a master pottery maker, recording her 
experiences in "The Road Through Miyama," released this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my own share of romantic notions when I went. They sure broke apart 
quickly," she said. For example, "I'd read a lot about Zen, then I found that 
the young people (in Japan) were more materialistic than anyone I'd ever met in 
this society." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Islands of Diversity 
</P>
<P>
But she thinks all the talk about the uniqueness -- the inscrutability -- of 
Japanese is rubbish, whether espoused by the expats or the Japanese themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear so much about the Japanese, as if it's really a homogeneous culture," 
she said. "I believe the more you look at it, the more diversity you see. I 
think we do a disservice to look too much for one image of the Japanese that 
fits the whole country. People in Tokyo can't even understand the language of 
people in Kagoshima." 
</P>
<P>
One popular vehicle for examining both Japan and the experience of gaijin in 
Japan has been to examine the mutually shared national pastime of besuboru -- 
or baseball as it is called in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In "You Gotta Have Wa," (wa meaning "team spirit, unity, the ball club always 
comes first"), Robert Whiting uses the sport to illustrate Japan's business 
savvy, its sociological makeup and something of its essential character, as one 
team's motto has it, after all, "The Way of Baseball Is the Way of the Human 
Being." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separated by Culture 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, though, the book shows how human beings can be separated by 
culture. American major leaguers, lured to Japan to play baseball for more 
money than they could hope to make here, find themselves confronted with a game 
philosophy and a people unlike anything they've known. 
</P>
<P>
To a point, Japanese fans, loonier in their devotion than Cub fans even, 
worship gaijin stars as heroes. But when the foreigner oversteps certain 
boundaries -- boundaries that are all but invisible to outsiders -- they feel 
more like scapegoats than stars. 
</P>
<P>
Whiting, who has written five books in Japanese, said that the idea behind his 
acclaimed "Wa" is to show Americans how hard it is to understand a culture like 
Japan. "Americans tend to think the world should be run on their own terms. But 
understanding this culture is really hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Besides learning the language, gaijin also must study Japan's culture and 
politics and history and psychology, said Whiting, who has a degree in Japanese 
politics from Sophia University in Tokyo. "Maybe if they read my book and some 
of the other books that have come out they'll lower expectations; if they 
expect cultural conflict, they won't be so disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major League Star 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they'll merely be confused, as was major league star Bob Horner, who 
said: "I don't know whether the Japanese system is good or not. I just don't 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Other long-time expats, however, sneer at the more recent breed that has come 
in and confronted Japan and flown away confused. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that Japan can't be understood "is a very easy conclusion to reach, 
and it's the one they want to reach even before they start writing," Donald 
Keene, an authority on Japanese literature, said from Tokyo, where he lives the 
three seasons of the year when he's not teaching at Columbia University. "A 
person will come with ideas about how he'd like to be among the simple 
Japanese. When he finds that the country isn't like that, he writes about it 
not in terms of his own failings but in terms of the failings of Japanese 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, most foreigners don't stay long enough to get a grasp of the 
basic culture, let alone to infiltrate the areas of life where cutting edge 
ideas are debated. "People who come here and expect that they're going to find 
their way into the intellectual society here without speaking Japanese are 
completely deluded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Views 
</P>
<P>
For Leithauser, Japan was so different it forced him to see things in a fresh 
way. But he never presumed to do more than record his own impressions of a 
country he enjoyed so much he wants to live in it again, he said. "I was hoping 
to get in a lot of the smells, the sights, and hoping thereby to write a richer 
novel, one that was more interesting and lively. But I wasn't planning to plumb 
the soul of East and West." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have taken a stab at plumbing Japan's soul come at it from all 
directions, from the journalistic (as in David Halberstam's "The Reckoning,") 
the scholarly (as in Karel Van Wolferen's "Enigma of Japanese Power: People and 
Politics in a Stateless Nation,") and the jocular (as in Gary Katzenstein's 
"Funny Business, an Outsider's Year in Japan" and Robert Collins' series, "Max 
Danger: Adventures of an Expat in Tokyo.") 
</P>
<P>
But it's the many Bildungsromane -- the rite of passage novels -- written by 
the new wave of expats that put off many of the Westerners who have lived in 
Japan for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Write and Leave 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, "these people write and go home," said Donald Richie, who 
has lived in Japan since 1945 and has written four novels about the country. 
"If they want to pass into adulthood here, that's just dandy . . . But they 
don't stay here long enough to get any depth," he said. "They're only using the 
Japanese to bounce off their own sounding boards of self. They're also 
small-minded -- so interested in what the experience can give them in the way 
of self-revelation, they don't look at (Japan) on its own terms." 
</P>
<P>
And as often as not, they don't find what they're looking for in themselves any 
more than they do in the country. 
</P>
<P>
For Schwartz, at least, the three and a half months he spent in Tokyo were 
transformational. "Bicycle Days" was his senior thesis for Harvard's Asian 
studies department. He and the faculty both thought it would be a scholarly 
examination of the business customs and economics -- the sort of thing that 
would help him on the path to success in international banking. It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
The act of writing drew Schwartz away from rationality and into emotions, he 
said. "That is the antithesis of how I've come to view living in Japan or 
Japanese society in general." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waning Fascination 
</P>
<P>
He knows that Japan is increasingly important "politically, economically, even 
socially." Still, "my fascination with Japan has waned every day." 
</P>
<P>
He has cast off his aspirations of becoming an investment banker. Now he sees 
himself as a budding novelist. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're writing, it's the emotional responses that pull you by the leash 
and lead you somewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Next month they'll lead him to another expatriate life. This time in Paris.

ARCHITECTURE: SCHINDLER ODE TO MODERNISM ON THE MEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Hollywood house that Viennese expatriate architect Rudolf Michael 
Schindler built for himself in 1922 is more than an enduring icon of early 
modern architecture, more than the prototype of new ideas that have deeply 
influenced residential design throughout the United States and abroad: The 
Schindler House was the temple of bohemian exuberance in a young Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Calling this structure a house is misleading," wrote architectural historian 
Kathryn Smith on the centennial of Schindler's birth in 1987. "Referring to it 
as a building also obscures its meaning; environment might be a more suitable 
term." 
</P>
<P>
Given a new lease on life by a $150,000 restoration program financed by the 
City of West Hollywood and the California Office of Historic Preservation, the 
once-decaying structure is on the road to full recovery, ready to take its 
rightful place as a monument to modernism. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles," said Robert Sweeney, president of the Friends of the Schindler 
House, "is waking up to the richness of its architectural heritage and the need 
to preserve this vital history." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Reputation 
</P>
<P>
Schindler's reputation as the least understood and least appreciated of the 
American pioneers of modern architecture has turned around in the last decade. 
"Rudolf Schindler and Los Angeles are one and inseparable," declared 
architectural historian David Gebhard. "Complexity, ambiguity, contradiction 
are the ingredients of Schindler's architecture, just as they are the guts and 
substance of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Designed to be shared by Schindler and his wife, Pauline, with Pauline's 
college friend, Marion Chase, and her engineer husband Clyde, the Schindler 
House was arranged as an interlocking pattern of three live-in studios each 
with its own private outdoor "room." This total integration of exterior and 
interior spaces, flowing together through sliding glass walls, was only one of 
the design's radical innovations. 
</P>
<P>
The true originality of the Kings Road house lies in its design of the entire 
100 by 200-foot lot as a total environment. Solid concrete walls sheltered the 
site from its neighbors on either side and divided the three studios one from 
another. Within each studio glass walls, canvas screens and redwood windows 
made light of the space with a Japanese simplicity of style. 
</P>
<P>
The house's architecture was a subtle fusion of a number of influences, 
seamlessly combined to conjure up what was then a radical way of life. There 
was the influence of Japanese domestic architecture with its low-key serenity, 
severe discipline of detail and ground-hugging roof lines. To this Schindler 
added the memory of such turn-of-the-century Austrian pre-modernist architects 
as Adolf Loos, Otto Wagner, Josef Olbrich and Josef Hermann. And there was the 
admiration Schindler felt for his master and sometime employer, Frank Lloyd 
Wright, who brought the young Viennese architect to Los Angeles in 1920 to 
supervise the construction of Aline Barnsdall's Hollyhock House. Above all 
there was the impact that California's open spaces, easy climate and natural 
grandeur had upon Schindler's soul. 
</P>
<P>
The story goes that the idea for the Kings Road house came to Schindler while 
he was camping in Yosemite. "The theme fulfills the basic requirements of a 
camper's shelter," Schindler explained. "(Each room has) a protected back, an 
open front, a fireplace and a roof." 
</P>
<P>
The construction of the house embodied Schindler's ambition to achieve what 
Sweeney calls "a moral simplicity concealing art." The basic structural system, 
consisting of precast, tilt-up concrete wall slabs left unplastered and linked 
by slots filled with opaque glass, was complemented by natural redwood treated 
with a solution of hot beeswax, turpentine and linseed oil. Moral simplicity 
extended to the elimination of eaves troughs and rainwater drainpipes and a 
refusal to modify the local climate with any heating or cooling system. The 
only opulence allowed appeared in the copper fireplace hoods and in the 
lushness of the screens of bamboo at the front and rear of the property. 
</P>
<P>
After 1925, when Schindler's fellow Austrian expatriate, Richard Neutra and his 
wife, Dione, moved in, the house became the epitome of 1920s bohemianism, West 
Coast variety. With its rooftop canvas-covered sleeping porches and bare cement 
floors, it resembled a roughshod cabin created to celebrate free love, fresh 
air and a solemn dedication to an anti-bourgeois libertarianism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experiences Hit Home 
</P>
<P>
Modern dancer John Bovington pranced nude in the garden, before an audience of 
artists, architects and expatriate European intellectuals. Harwell Harris, one 
of the younger Los Angeles architects drawn to the Schindler circle, described 
an encounter with Dione Neutra in which the architect's wife appeared without 
make-up and barelegged, "wearing something resembling a toga." Her appearance 
suggested to the awe-struck Harris "that this mountain I was on was maybe Mount 
Olympus." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings Road house astonished and delighted emerging local modern designers 
such as Harris and Gregory Ain who described a visit to the house as entering 
"another world." But it also strongly colored their thinking about the new 
architecture that was struggling to establish itself in Southern California in 
the 1930s and '40s. Many of the ideas Schindler tried out in 1922 -- including 
the fluid integration of outdoor and indoor spaces and the simplicity of 
construction -- were manifested in the famous Case Study House program that 
began in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
An old photo in the room that now serves as a bookstore captures a moment of 
bohemian harmony. Schindler and Neutra stand in typical poses -- Schindler, 
with an open-necked shirt and hands in pockets, turns his face sideways to the 
camera to stretch his short neck and emphasize his wild mop and Roman profile; 
Neutra, wearing a tie even in the hot sunshine, looks straight into the lens' 
eye. At their feet Dione Neutra holds her baby son Dion in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
But utopias are notoriously unstable. After squabbling about everything from 
sharing the kitchen to the ethics of architecture, the Neutras moved out in 
1930. Schindler and Pauline split up after heated temperamental clashes, and 
she departed with her young son Mark to live in Carmel. When she returned to 
Los Angeles in the mid-1930s, she took over the Neutras' old studio and only 
communicated with Rudolf by letter, though they lived on either side of the 
same wall. She occupied her studio until 1977, 24 years after her husband's 
death, running an artsy salon that attracted such luminaries as novelist 
Theodore Dreiser and photographer Edward Weston. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends of the Schindler House (FOSH) was organized a year before Pauline's 
death. In 1980 the group bought the Kings Road house from the Schindler family 
with the aid of a $160,000 state grant. Already FOSH has repaired the decaying 
roof, replaced the ancient plumbing and electrics and stripped the paint from 
the concrete walls. But Sweeney estimates that the house, now open weekends for 
public tours, will cost another $500,000 to fully restore inside and out, 
including the landscaping Schindler designed as part of the total environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is not to make the house look new," he said. "That would be false. 
What we must do is prevent further decay while restoring the house to some 
semblance of its original ambiance. In that way the history and the relevance 
of the design will be perpetuated for the future."

SANTA ANA YOUTH HIT BY GUNFIRE FROM CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old boy riding in the back of a pickup truck was critically wounded 
Friday night in a burst of gunfire from another car in an area of central Santa 
Ana where residents say gang crime is growing. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred at 10:40 p.m. in the 1300 block of North Sullivan Street, 
when a car pulled up behind the pickup truck and the driver of the car began 
flashing his headlights, according to Santa Ana police. A passenger then leaned 
from the car window and fired on the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers in the rear of the truck ducked, but a third -- Jose Saldana of 
Santa Ana -- did not react quickly enough, according to Sgt. John Dittus. 
Saldana remained in critical condition Saturday at United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. No one else was injured, Dittus said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Hangout 
</P>
<P>
No description of the car from which the shots were fired was available 
Saturday, and police said they had not determined whether the incident was 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about five blocks south of a Sullivan Street drug hangout 
where police in the last two weeks have made several arrests in a narcotics 
crackdown. Mayor Daniel H. Young, who reacted to protests from operators of a 
day-care center across the street from an apartment complex where much of the 
drug trafficking took place, promised intensive police action and a program to 
repair or demolish vacant houses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The 1300 block of North Sullivan Street, with its modest but manicured ranch 
homes, is in an area that has become unsafe at night because of a growing gang 
problem, residents there said. Nighttime gunfire frequently erupts along 
surrounding side streets in the mostly Latino neighborhood of middle- and 
low-income residents, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last five years, it's a mess," said Fernand Van der Roest, who has 
lived on the block since 1960. "You hear gunshots from the other streets around 
here, and there are always cars screeching by like it was a freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Van der Roest said he was watching the television news with the curtains drawn 
Friday night when he heard racing cars and then gunshots on the street in front 
of his house. By the time he got to the window, he said, he could only see a 
truck and a car speeding away. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard six or seven shots, one after another," Van der Roest said. "I didn't 
know if they were shooting in the air or at someone." 
</P>
<P>
Another longtime resident of the block, who asked not to be identified, said 
she also heard the shots, but did not see the incident. Increasing gang 
activity in the area has forced most residents into their homes at sundown, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to be paranoid, but it's getting worse and worse," she said. "I just 
stay inside and try not to get involved."

SHORTAGE OF WATER TAPS NEW POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She takes her sermon from meeting to meeting, preaching against the sin of 
water misuse, pleading for San Clemente to repent and conserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Water has finite limits," says former San Clemente Mayor Karoline Koester. "We 
don't have unlimited water." 
</P>
<P>
That point was driven home to San Clemente in July and August, as residents' 
thirst for water strongly outpaced supply, and the city's reservoir dwindled to 
unprecedented low levels. 
</P>
<P>
Now, facing the possibility of another water-short summer next year, the San 
Clemente City Council and other government bodies and agencies are revising 
their water policies -- heeding the call of Koester and other advocates of 
slower growth in San Clemente. Those advocates say that this summer's water 
shortage was a harbinger of a more serious drought unless San Clemente better 
manages its resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Drama Unfolds 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure the existing residents and businesses won't suffer -- 
that there'll be no shortages for them in the future," said Mayor Brian J. 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-July, when San Clemente's reservoir began drying up, the city's water 
drama has unfolded like this: 
</P>
<P>
* The San Clemente City Council on Aug. 30 proposed an emergency 
water-rationing ordinance. The council, however, later deferred action on the 
measure. It is now scheduled for discussion Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
* The Tri-Cities Municipal Water District, an independent public agency that 
serves as a water wholesaler, criticized the City Council for not taking 
immediate action on the water-rationing ordinance. "Although we are not 
currently facing a crisis situation, the possibility of a water shortage or 
supply-line disruption is ever present," Tri-Cities Board President Dennis A. 
Erdman wrote to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
* San Clemente Utilities Director Greg Morehead said that Tri-Cities really 
isn't sure where its diminishing water went during the shortage last summer. 
Morehead said he has figures showing that the Tri-Cities reservoir continued to 
shrink even as San Clemente businesses and developers voluntarily cut back 
water use in massive amounts. 
</P>
<P>
* San Clemente Chamber of Commerce officials expressed concern that any 
proposed water rationing would hurt business and development. 
</P>
<P>
* Residents appeared before both the City Council and the Tri-Cities board of 
directors to express concern about future water shortages. 
</P>
<P>
* The City Council announced at its Sept. 20 meeting that developers henceforth 
must certify the availability of adequate water before the city will issue 
final building permits. The council's announcement came as it approved plans 
for a major residential development by Centex Homes in northern San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
* Tri-Cities said it would discuss the possibility of a water allocation system 
at its meeting this Wednesday. Such a plan, if adopted, would earmark a 
percentage of available water to various communities, including San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Koester advocates both a city water-rationing plan, in case of 
emergencies, and a water district allocation program. She says both are needed 
to make sure that the San Clemente area is not allowed to grow beyond its 
resources -- including water. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the only one in San Clemente concerned about this," Koester said in a 
recent interview. "There are many people worried about growth in the 
community." Koester noted that many residents have voiced, or written letters 
to various city officials, about the water scare last summer. Nonetheless, 
Koester has been the loudest drum-beater in the community to get coordinated 
action for water conservation. She attends meetings of any and all agencies 
where water is, or may become, an item on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Cities Municipal Water District has only one intake pipe to its reservoir. 
Ray Woodside, general manager for the water district, said plenty of water was 
available to the district. But he said users were consuming the water this past 
summer faster than the supply could be replenished. The district's reservoir, 
situated in north San Clemente, holds about 48 million gallons, and at one 
point in August it shrank to 17 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Cities provides water for all of San Clemente, part of Dana Point (the 
Capistrano Beach area), the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and San 
Onofre State Park. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente is by far the biggest consumer, traditionally accounting for about 
66% of the water district's consumption, according to Woodside. 
</P>
<P>
None of the water users, including San Clemente, have contracts guaranteeing 
them a set amount of Tri-Cities' overall supply. In the past, users have simply 
taken what they have needed. The supply was always adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Koester says those days are now gone. She contends that even when Tri-Cities 
gets another intake pipe, which is scheduled in 1991, water supplies cannot be 
considered infinite. Thus, she argues, San Clemente must know how much of 
Tri-Cities' water it will always be guaranteed -- what its allocation will be. 
</P>
<P>
Koester is no longer on the City Council, but several on the current council 
have said they agree with her concern about water availability. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sept. 20 council meeting, Councilman Scott Diehl said he strongly agreed 
with the city's new policy of linking building permits to water availability. 
"This puts developers on notice that water supply in this area is delicate," 
Diehl said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Rice, in an interview this week, said the water-shortage scare last 
summer must not be forgotten by the city. "We need some kinds of regulation -- 
decent guidelines and decent plans for equitable allocations," Rice said. But 
he added that he does not want San Clemente and its population of about 40,000 
to lower its standard of living to allow for more water for future residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair for our residents to ask, 'Why do I have to conserve my 
water so you can build more and more?' " Rice said. "My concern is to not allow 
growth to hurt residents and businesses who are already here. They shouldn't 
have to do with less water because of new growth.

The Fullerton Fire Department will ask the City Council Tuesday to ban the sale 
and use of the so-called "safe and sane" fireworks, although most council 
members say they would like to keep them legal. The fire chief asked the 
council to consider the ban after he collected information showing that Orange 
County cities that have banned fireworks have far fewer fireworks-related fires 
than cities where the fireworks are allowed.

MAN HANGS HIMSELF ON TREE NEXT TO FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities were trying to determine the identity of a man in his late 20s who 
hanged himself Saturday night from a tree along a freeway in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Police Sgt. Frank Hauptmann said there was no evidence of foul 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The man apparently fashioned a noose out of rope, climbed the tree, tied the 
rope to a branch and jumped off, police said. 
</P>
<P>
He was spotted dangling about 15 feet above the ground by several passing 
motorists, who called police, Hauptmann said. When paramedics arrived at the 
spot on the north side of the Garden Grove freeway near the Harbor Boulevard 
exit, the man was already dead, he said.

TRUCK CARRYING ORANGES OVERTURNS, BLOCKS ANAHEIM FREEWAY FOR 2 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tractor-trailer truck rolled over Saturday on the Riverside Freeway in 
Anaheim, spilling a load of oranges and shutting down the highway for more than 
two hours. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the 3:45 p.m. accident just east of Imperial Highway, but 
thousands of motorists were stranded on the freeway until the mess was cleaned 
up shortly before 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Some drivers resorted to taking side streets to get around the crash, but the 
majority waited it out while crews cleared the freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A California Highway Patrol spokesman said the accident apparently occurred 
when a car blew a tire, swerved into the big rig, then ricocheted down an 
embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Luivano, 24, of Escondido lost control of the truck, which swung 
across traffic and overturned onto its side, spilling the load of oranges 
across the pavement, the CHP spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car that triggered the accident fled the scene afterward, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had been unable to identify the man, who was apparently unhurt, by 
late Saturday night.
