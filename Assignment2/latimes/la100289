SOVIET DEFENSE CHIEF IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first Soviet defense minister to visit the United States arrived in 
Washington for a six-day visit in which he will hold talks with U.S. leaders, 
tour American military bases and take in a Civil War site. Dmitri T. Yazov, 65, 
was greeted on his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., by Defense 
Undersecretary Paul G. Wolfowitz. Yazov was accompanied by his wife, Emma, and 
senior Soviet military leaders. Yazov's schedule includes visits to Navy and 
Marine Corps installations in Southern California. Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney issued the invitation to Yazov to reciprocate for the visit Cheney's 
predecessor, Frank C. Carlucci, made to the Soviet Union in August, 1988.

HEAVY RAIN, FATAL TORNADO BATTER SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrential rains battered the South, where a tornado also killed a woman and an 
infant, injured a dozen more people and destroyed a church in a 10-mile rampage 
near the southern Georgia town of Moultrie. Most of the damage and both deaths 
occurred at a mobile home park. The tornado tore through a stand of timber 
after wrecking the mobile homes and then demolished the Bethlehem Schley 
Baptist Church, police said. The heavy rains -- more than 5 inches in 
metropolitan Atlanta in 24 hours -- prompted the National Weather Service to 
issue flood watches and warnings about earthen dams in most of the Southern 
states. Some roads in south central Tennessee were closed under several inches 
of water. Elsewhere, snow was predicted in Montana, and warnings were issued to 
ranchers in northern Wyoming where livestock could become vulnerable to cold 
gusty winds and rain changing to snow.

Thousands of supporters of the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos marched 
through Manila demanding that President Corazon Aquino allow his body to be 
buried in the Philippines. Meanwhile, Aquino -- who barred the return on 
grounds that this might spark civil disorder -- said on her weekly radio 
program that she will follow any Philippine Supreme Court order to allow the 
return of Marcos' body but is confident the justices will support her ban. 
Attorneys for Marcos said they will file a motion today asking the Supreme 
Court to reconsider its Sept. 15 decision dismissing a petition to allow Marcos 
to come home.

Rain soaked the debris-strewn streets of Charleston, but survivors of the 
coastal city ravaged by Hurricane Hugo banded together to give thanks for life. 
Morris Street Baptist Church, as in many areas of the city, remained without 
power 10 days after Hugo's 135-m.p.h. winds hit, but Sunday school and services 
were held in the natural light from windows. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a South 
Carolina native, visited the church and met a caravan of trucks with supplies 
from Washington, D.C. Thousands still are without power, and more than 1,000 
people in Charleston and outlying areas sought shelter with the Red Cross. 
Drinking water has been restored to many, but residents were asked to conserve 
water because of sewage problems.

Two hundred anti-nuclear protesters were arrested at a remote U.S.-Australian 
military base, bringing the total detained in three days of demonstrations to 
nearly 500. The intelligence-gathering facility at Nurrungar, 360 miles 
northwest of Adelaide, the capital of South Australia state, is considered by 
demonstrators to be a likely target in a superpower nuclear exchange. The 
federal government called in 50 soldiers over the weekend after nine protesters 
entered the complex and one climbed inside a radar dome. It was the first time 
Australian troops had been called on to face a civil disturbance. Those 
arrested have been charged with trespass and damage to property.

In western Cambodia, heavy fighting continued as the government brought in 
reinforcements to face a drive by non-Communist resistance forces. The 
offensive by the Khmer People's National Liberation Front was launched less 
than a week after Vietnam proclaimed the complete withdrawal of its troops from 
Cambodia. Military sources at the Thai-Cambodian border said the fighting, 
along a 30-mile stretch from 12 miles to 25 inside Cambodia, had forced the 
closure of all border trading points.

CHEN BODA; ADVISER TO MAO BEFORE HE WAS IMPRISONED 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen Boda, the onetime No. 4 man in China who advised Mao Tse-tung for 30 years 
before leading purges during the Cultural Revolution, has died in Beijing of 
heart failure, the pro-Beijing press said here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Chen was 85 when he died at his Beijing home on Sept. 20, the Hong Kong China 
News Service reported. The pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao said Mao's 
disgraced colleague was cremated Thursday under his original name -- Chen 
Jianxiang. 
</P>
<P>
Chen was one of Mao's former secretaries and became the head of Mao's Central 
Cultural Revolution Group in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he was put on trial along with the so-called Gang of Four, the radical 
leaders of the Cultural Revolution. The man whom the Communist Party newspaper, 
the People's Daily, dubbed the "mad persecutor," was sentenced to 18 years in 
jail for "counterrevolutionary activities" and purging innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Released on Probation 
</P>
<P>
Officials disclosed in early 1988 that Chen had been released on probation for 
medical reasons. He was believed living with a son in the Chinese capital at 
his death and quietly pursuing research at the city's Literature and History 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Chen was born in 1904 in coastal Fujian province and joined the Communist Party 
in the mid-1920s. He studied in Moscow for four years, returning in 1930 to 
teach at China College in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
When the Japanese occupied Beijing in 1937, Chen went west to Yenan, the remote 
base of China's Communist Party leaders. He taught at the party school and 
began his long friendship with Mao. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade Chen, as Mao's personal and political secretary, counseled 
Mao while writing some of the Chinese leader's most famous essays and speeches. 
He played a major role in drafting the new constitution of Communist-ruled 
China after 1949 and in 1958 became the first editor of the party's ideological 
journal, the Red Flag. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Went With Mao to Moscow 
</P>
<P>
He accompanied Mao on his only foreign trips, his 1949 and 1957 visits to 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966 Mao appointed Chen head of a four-member group assigned to lead the 
1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution by mobilizing China's masses to 
denounce alleged "capitalist roaders" in the party and purge the nation of 
bourgeois influences. 
</P>
<P>
Chen used the post to orchestrate campaigns against top officials, including 
party General Secretary Deng Xiaoping. He was regarded as the fourth most 
powerful person in China, behind Mao, Mao's designated successor Lin Biao and 
Premier Chou En-lai.

EVERETT PUTS IT IN GOOD HANDS

The order descended from the heavens, or close to it (the Ram coaches' box high 
above the Candlestick Park field). It made its way to the sideline headsets 
worn by assistant Norval Turner and from there, to the Ram huddle where 
quarterback Jim Everett presided. 
</P>
<P>
Get the ball to Pete Holohan. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a complicated command, just timely. Less than three minutes remained 
in Sunday's game between the Rams and the San Francisco 49ers, and more 
important, the 49ers were leading, 12-10. 
</P>
<P>
Then Ram offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, perched in the coaches box, 
noticed a little quirk in the 49er pass defense: nobody was covering Holohan. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost nobody. A 49er linebacker was assigned the duty of tailing Holohan 
while the rest of the secondary paid close attention to wide receivers Henry 
Ellard and the suddenly bothersome Flipper Anderson. Ask the Rams who wins the 
Holohan vs. Linebacker matchup and you get looks of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"He has some of the best hands in the NFL," said fellow tight end Damone 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"You watch Pete catch a football," said guard Tom Newberry, "and you realize 
it's something you can't do." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but the 49ers weren't entirely convinced. They began dispatching two 
defenders to Ellard's side of the field and kept a close eye on Anderson, who 
had earlier caught a 65-yard touchdown pass and nearly sneaked behind the 
secondary for another long reception. If the Rams were going to win, decided 
the 49ers, they were going to have to do it without Ellard or Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"They doubled me and took me out of the game," Ellard said. "It kind of left 
the middle open." 
</P>
<P>
Sure did, which is why Zampese told Turner to tell Everett that Holohan was 
available for passes. 
</P>
<P>
So, with a first and 10 on the Ram 44-yard line, and the clock moving toward 
zeroes, Everett entered the huddle and glanced at Holohan. "I'm going to give 
you a quick look on the post (pattern)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This was different. First of all, Ellard was the primary receiver on the play, 
not Holohan. Also, Holohan's role had been limited during most of the game. 
Lots of blocking, little catching. In fact, he had caught only one pass all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Holohan took his place in the formation. At the snap, he took off for the 
middle of the field and found nothing but wide open spaces . . . and the ball. 
Thirty-one yards later, the Rams were on the 49er 25. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where my man was," said Holohan, who finally was dragged down by 
rookie safety Johnny Jackson. "I knew that I was kind of alone. I just caught 
it and got tackled." 
</P>
<P>
As for any thoughts of dashing the remaining 25 or so yards, forget it. "No 
prayer," Holohan said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Rams happily settled for a first down deep in 49er territory. They 
had two choices at that point: play it safe (figuring Mike Lansford could make 
a 42-yard field goal) or try to move the ball even closer. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, that is, without the swirling, difficult winds of 
Candlestick Park, the Rams might have remained cautious. But Coach John 
Robinson had already made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"That wind was very tough," he said. "We felt like we had to get another first 
down to get it closer." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams tried a run . . . and lost three yards. A quick pass to Ellard gained 
one yard back. On third and 13 from the 49er 27, the order came again. 
</P>
<P>
Look for Holohan. 
</P>
<P>
Everett did just that and found Holohan wide open once more, this time for a 
16-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
Holohan literally jumped for joy after the catch. He had helped place the Rams 
in perfect position and cut Lansford's margin of error in half. 
</P>
<P>
"I swear, he's got flypaper on his hands," Newberry said. "He's like Spiderman. 
Sometimes I think he has little cobwebs in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn, it's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Holohan later thanked the entire Ram roster for making his fourth-period 
receptions possible. He congratulated the offensive line for blocking, Everett 
for throwing and Ellard and Anderson for drawing double coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times I'm getting single coverage," Holohan said. 
</P>
<P>
Holohan's work wasn't complete. After Greg Bell lurched forward for two yards, 
Robinson decided it was time to attempt the field goal. Holohan is the holder. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Holohan fielded the snap and Lansford promptly gave the Rams a 
13-12 last-second victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike nailed it -- by two inches," Holohan said, smiling.

RAIDERS FALL FLAT IN 24-20 LOSS;

KRIEG LEADS SEAHAWKS' FOURTH-QUARTER COMEBACK

Raider tradition lives and breathes, but it's upside down. Sunday featured that 
old favorite, the fourth-quarter rally, except that it was the Seattle Seahawks 
who overtook the rapidly stiffening Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders led, 17-7, when the quarter started but the Seahawks won, 24-20. 
The Raiders have given up at least 156 rushing yards in every game, have lost 
three in a row in the division and are in the cellar, tied with the Chiefs. 
Hello darkness, their old friend. 
</P>
<P>
Unless a miracle intervenes, or at least a road victory, they're headed for 
bigger trouble -- this was the easy part of the schedule, remember? -- and 
questions about Mike Shanahan's future, which were heard minutes after Sunday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is not really one where you're looking for a vote of confidence," 
Shanahan said. "I only know one way to go when your back's against the wall, 
work a little harder." 
</P>
<P>
Since Shanahan already works 18-hour days, how could it be possible to work 
harder? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not," Shanahan said. "The only thing you can do when your back's against 
the wall is keep going." 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the return, or debut at middle linebacker, of Jerry Robinson, 
back after missing eight weeks with a groin pull. Jackie Shipp slid to the 
inactive list, with Ricky Hunley promoted to Robinson's backup, and the Raiders 
had a decent first half against the strong Seahawk running game, holding it to 
69 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Dave Krieg torched the Raiders' young secondary, picking up 70% of 
his third downs, so that of the first 23 minutes 56 seconds, the Seahawks had 
the ball for 18:25. So far, the Raider defense has more problems than it can 
name, much less address. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise, at halftime the Raiders . . . led? 
</P>
<P>
It took some big plays, but they did. The Seahawks had a 7-0 lead when they 
drove 86 yards to the Raider four-yard line, only to be turned away with no 
points. On third and one, Mike Wise and Eddie Anderson swallowed up John L. 
Williams on a sweep and the Seahawks opted for a field goal that they didn't 
get. The snap was low and Tim Rother blocked Norm Johnson's chip shot. 
</P>
<P>
It was 7-3 when Hunley hit Williams who had just caught a swing pass. The ball 
flew out, right to Lionel (Touchdown) Washington, who had returned a John Elway 
interception for six points the week before. With this one, he sprinted 37 
yards untouched. The Raiders led, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
Then they actually started playing well. Jay Schroeder, who had started two for 
six, drove them 76 yards on the first possession of the second half, the last 
36 yards on a pass to Mervyn Fernandez, who shook off one safety, Nesby 
Glasgow, sidestepped the other, Eugene Robinson, and dashed into the end zone. 
The Raiders led, 17-7? 
</P>
<P>
The last Seahawk possession of the third period began at their 20, the Raiders 
having already sacked Krieg four times, their season high. The Seahawks had 
only 80 rushing yards. Their first two plays, runs by Warner and Williams, 
gained a scant five yards, making it third and five. The Raiders seemed in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Oops! Krieg hit Williams in the left flat and John L. skirted the last starting 
Plan B linebacker, Thomas Benson, for 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Seahawks did another of those walk-on-their-chest numbers the 
Raiders have experienced so much of: a seven-yard pass to tight end Robert 
Tyler; Williams for eight, Warner for 16; a third-and-seven pass to Tommy Kane 
for 19; Warner around right end untouched for six and the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The drive started with Hunley playing and finished with Robinson. Robinson, who 
had the flu and groin pull, said by this time he was weak and light-headed. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates didn't seem so robust themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The next time the Seahawks got the ball, they eased 42 yards to a touchdown. 
Krieg threw a 19-yard scoring pass to Brian Blades over the injured 
Washington's replacement, the venerable Mike Haynes. Haynes got a hand on the 
ball and argued that it had come out too quickly to be a completion, but he 
didn't insist on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," said Haynes later, "those officials are on top of it. They were 
right there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a good throw and catch. I might have been able to play it a little 
better by not looking back but I don't know. I don't remember too much of that 
game." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks led, 21-17. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder promptly whipped the Raiders from his 20 to the Seattle 10, passing 
for 80 yards (another 10 were required to make up for a holding call). But 
there on third and five, he couldn't find a receiver and threw the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
"They had everybody jammed up inside," Schroeder said. "There was a slim chance 
so I threw it over the top, where only Mervyn could get it." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Fernandez could get this one. Jeff Jaeger kicked a 28-yard field goal 
and it was 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Raiders had to stop them . . . but couldn't. They got a bad break when 
a Krieg pass bounced off the hands of the tight end, Tyler, right to Blades, 
16-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the time, they just got pushed out of the way as they have been all 
season. The Seahawks drove to the Raider 30, where with 1:15 left and the 
Raiders out of timeouts, Norm Johnson kicked a 48-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders ran three plays and found themselves with a fourth-and-21 at their 
three. Schroeder lofted a pass but Eugene Robinson caught it. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan said later he was "very, very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis, who rarely says anything on the record, paced the dressing room, 
shaking off interviewers. He didn't look too happy, either. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders may also have lost three starters. Vann McElroy and Lionel 
Washington pulled hamstrings and Don Mosebar reinjured his bad knee. 
"Disheartening's not the word, man," said a downcast McElroy. "That's not the 
word for it." . . . Mervyn Fernandez caught seven passes for 113 yards, giving 
him his second 100-yard game in a row. He has now caught a touchdown pass in 
each game and leads the team in scoring. "It doesn't matter how well I'm doing 
if the team isn't winning," he said. "This isn't a track meet." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Townsend had two sacks, and forced a fumble. After a slow start, he has a 
team-high three sacks in two games. . . . Left tackle Rory Graves, whistled for 
three straight holding calls plus an earlier illegal motion at Denver and 
beaten for three sacks in his first three games, was called for three more 
holds Sunday (one accepted, two declined). The Raiders have shifted him from 
right tackle, where he did well last season, to the left side where quick feet 
are more important and there is at least a question whether he can handle it. . 
. . The crowd of 44,319 was the Raiders' largest in five Coliseum appearances 
this season, including exhibitions.

CHARGERS WIN, GET OPTIMISTIC; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER BEATING PHOENIX, THEY LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING DENVER

The Chargers will play for a share of first place next Sunday in Denver. That's 
improbable enough. But all of a sudden they are blocking, tackling, talking and 
thinking like a team that can beat the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same Charger team that gave up 77 points and allowed 785 yards in 
losing its first two games. But its people insist it is not the same Charger 
team that lost two and won two last year before lurching to a 6-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a much better football team," said Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers 
director of football operations, after it came from behind to beat the Phoenix 
Cardinals, 24-13, Sunday at Sun Devil Stadium. "This team can move the football 
and not turn it over." 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between this year and last?" said Charger cornerback Gill Byrd. 
"This team has Jim McMahon and a winning attitude. He's a leader. And it 
shows." 
</P>
<P>
It was McMahon who figured out how to solve the overstacked Cardinal defense 
that limited the Chargers to 80 yards of offense in the first half. It was 
McMahon who beat the blitz with a 16-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver 
Anthony Miller in the third period that gave the Chargers their first lead, 
7-6. 
</P>
<P>
It was McMahon who completed 15 of 23 passes for 188 yards. And it was McMahon 
who threw no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess McMahon's performance, Charger Coach Dan Henning said: "He 
won." 
</P>
<P>
So much for football being a 45-man game. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's zero-defect quarterbacking enabled the Chargers to enjoy a 4-0 edge 
in turnovers. Defensive backs Roy Bennett and Byrd each intercepted quarterback 
Gary Hogeboom. Linebacker Billy Ray Smith recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Smith returned the first one 15 yards for a touchdown after a Byrd hit 
separated fullback Earl Ferrell from the ball. According to Smith, it was the 
first touchdown he has scored since "I was 8 years old and caught a pass from 
my brother in Dicky Winder's driveway. It was right on the asphalt. I skinned 
my elbow. It was wicked." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Smith touchdown gave the Chargers a 21-13 lead with 12:50 to play. 
And, said Henning, "it gave us the cushion to play the way we wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
When Chris Bahr added a 37-yard field goal -- his first three-point attempt of 
the year -- with four minutes and 17 seconds remaining, the Chargers' cushion 
grew to 11. 
</P>
<P>
In its last two games, the Charger defense has taken the ball away nine times. 
The Charger offense hasn't turned it over once. The Charger defense limited 
Phoenix to 69 yards rushing and underscored how much the Cardinals miss injured 
Stump Mitchell, their best back. 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom finished with 22 completions in 43 tries for 261 yards, including a 
59-yard scoring play to Roy Green 9:50 into the third period. But the Chargers 
sacked him four times and constantly hurried his throws. 
</P>
<P>
Charger line coach Larry Beightol said McMahon didn't have trouble figuring out 
an antidote to the Cardinal defense that was shifting an extra linebacker to 
the strong formation side of the field in the first half. During that span the 
Chargers, who entered the game ranked third in the league in average gain per 
rush, ran for only 30 yards. Six of the Chargers' first seven possessions ended 
in punts. 
</P>
<P>
So McMahon started checking off to the other side. And the ground game began to 
flow. It produced 73 yards in the second half and helped set up the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to Miller's touchdown, Phoenix had built a 6-0 lead on field goals of 36 
and 33 yards by Al Del Greco. But when Cardinal cornerback Carl Carter slipped 
and fell midway through the third period, McMahon and Miller hooked up on a 
47-yard completion and a first down at the Phoenix 19. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later Carter stumbled over teammate Marcus Turner, leaving Miller 
all alone in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals (2-2) knew they would have problems without Mitchell and 
defensive end Freddie Joe Nunn, suspended last week for violations of the NFL's 
substance abuse policies. 
</P>
<P>
But, said fullback Ron Wolfley before the game, "we've pretty much just got to 
believe we've got dandruff and brush it off." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Cardinals should change shampoos. Right now the Chargers are head and 
shoulders better than they are. But the Chargers will have to be even better 
than that if they hope to beat the Broncos (3-1) at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We're 2-2 and I don't know how good that is," said a cautious Henning. "We're 
still, in my opinion, a ways away from where we want to be."

VERDIN RETURNS PUNT FOR TOUCHDOWN AS COLTS BEAT JETS, 17-10

<P>
For most of Sunday's game against the New York Jets, the Indianapolis Colts' 
offense found just about every way it could to blow scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
Then Clarence Verdin found the best way to succeed -- ensure that the offense 
wouldn't get the ball by returning a punt 49 yards for the winning touchdown as 
the Colts defeated the Jets, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
Verdin's touchdown made up for several Colts' mistakes, including two 
touchdowns nullified on the same series; giving up a touchdown on a 92-yard 
interception return; numerous key penalties; losing a scoring chance when Eric 
Dickerson fumbled at the Jets' 15-yard line, and a botched fake punt. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Biasucci's 39-yard field goal tied the score, 10-10, with 10:18 left in 
the fourth quarter. A minute later, Verdin fielded Joe Prokop's punt on the New 
York 49, raced between two defenders and up the middle untouched into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows this is a game of emotion and I think the return finally turned 
it around for us," Verdin said, "especially after the 14-point turnaround in 
the first quarter. We needed this lift." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts (2-2) drove to the Jets' 10 when Dickerson burst up the middle for an 
apparent touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But replay official Tom Kelleher ruled that Dickerson's knee hit the ground at 
the one. Two plays later, Dickerson went over again, but left guard Randy Dixon 
was called for illegal motion. 
</P>
<P>
Colts' Coach Ron Meyer said: "We were in the end zone twice and they took 
points off the board both times. I was so irate the staff had to calm me down. 
Fortunately, we were able to come back. We practice punt returns so much, it 
was good to see it pay off." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Leahy's 26-yard field goal on the final play of the first half gave the 
Jets a 10-0 lead. The drive was extended by a bizarre flea-flicker play on 
which Roger Vick lateraled the ball from a crowd, Ken O'Brien picked it up on a 
bounce and completed a 10-yard pass to Mickey Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
"That seemed typical of our day," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Trudeau, who was 17 of 30 for 246 yards, hit Billy Brooks on a 55-yard 
touchdown pass play 2:10 into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts' defense sacked O'Brien five times, twice by rookie Quintus McDonald. 
O'Brien finished with 20 of 31 for 222 yards for the Jets (1-3).

MARINO MISFIRES, OILERS WIN;

HOUSTON HOLDS HIM TO 103 YARDS IN A 39-7 VICTORY OVER MIAMI

<TEXT>
<P>
Even with Dan Marino at his best the Miami Dolphins have trouble winning. When 
he struggles, they have no chance. 
</P>
<P>
Houston held Marino to a career-low 103 passing yards as a starter and the 
Oilers overpowered the Dolphins, 39-7, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get in his face and frustrate him," Oiler defensive end William 
Fuller said. "We weren't worried about sacks. We wanted to bat the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Fuller and backup end Richard Byrd each batted down passes. 
</P>
<P>
Marino left the game with 11:29 remaining after completing 11 of 29 passes and 
throwing two interceptions. Marino passed for 90 yards as a reserve in his pro 
debut in 1983 against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't point to one thing," Marino said. "We can't give up, we just have to 
keep playing and try to get better as a team." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers didn't get a sack, extending the Dolphins' NFL record to 16 games 
without allowing a sack. Marino has not been sacked in 647 pass attempts. 
</P>
<P>
But Houston's defensive line harassed Marino throughout the game and batted 
down two of his passes early. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what the doctor ordered," Oiler safety Jeff Donaldson said. "We really 
planned on him moving the ball. We just wanted to contain him. 
</P>
<P>
"But after the first two series, when it was three plays and out, it seemed he 
was pressing." 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Warren Moon was the quarterback with the hot hand this day, 
completing 19 of 23 passes for 254 yards and two touchdowns. Moon's touchdown 
throws covered two yards to Allen Pinkett and 25 yards to Curtis Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
Passes by Moon set up four other Houston scores, including field goals of 32, 
40 and 32 yards by Tony Zendejas. Moon completed 12 of 14 passes in the first 
half and had a streak of 10 consecutive completions at one point. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers (2-2) took a 19-0 halftime lead on a safety when a high snap was 
batted out of the end zone by Miami punter Reggie Roby, a 32-yard field goal by 
Zendejas, a three-yard scoring run by Alonzo Highsmith and Pinkett's touchdown 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
Zendejas added kicks of 40 and 32 in the third quarter and Moon hit Duncan with 
a touchdown pass after a 48-yard interception return by Robert Lyles. 
</P>
<P>
A 33-yard run by Lorenzo White set up Pinkett's second touchdown, a 10-yard run 
with 2:58 left, making it 39-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (1-3) averted a shutout on a 97-yard kickoff return by Marc Logan 
with 2:40 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Coach Don Shula couldn't recall a worse performance for the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do anything right," he said. "It's one of the worst performances 
I've been associated with. I'm bitterly disappointed. Our offense didn't get 
anything going and our defense couldn't stop anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"(Marino) was ineffective at times and had some dropped sometimes. But he was 
going against eight defensive backs and tight coverage. They totally 
disregarded the run." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it worked.

THREE FIELD GOALS BY LOHMILLER GIVE WASHINGTON A WIN

Washington kicker Chip Lohmiller enjoyed one of his best performances Sunday 
while Morten Andersen struggled through one of his worst. 
</P>
<P>
Lohmiller kicked three field goals and Gerald Riggs scored a touchdown on a 
nine-yard run as the Washington Redskins rallied for a 16-14 victory Sunday 
over the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen, the most accurate kicker in NFL history, missed two field goals, 
including a 36-yarder with 2:34 left to play. He also missed 52-yard kick in 
the third quarter, giving him a 3-7 mark for the season, well off his 78% 
career mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Andersen is too good a kicker for that to happen," Lohmiller said. "He'll 
bounce back. It felt good to come in and kick against him. It felt real good to 
have a game like this and help the team." 
</P>
<P>
Two of Lohmiller's field goals came after Saint turnovers -- a fumble by Eric 
Martin recovered by A.J. Johnson at the New Orleans 29-yard line on the second 
play of the game and a muffed punt by Derrick Shepard in the fourth quarter 
recovered by Dave Harbour on the Saints 18. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (2-2) lost a yard on three tries on the first possession, and 
Lohmiller kicked a 48-yard field goal. The Redskins drove to a first-and-goal 
at the four-yard line after the recovery of Shepard's fumble, but three rushes 
gained three yards, and Lohmiller kicked the winning field goal from 18 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He also hit a 19-yarder in the third quarter when Washington could get only 
nine yards after a first-and-goal from the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs' touchdown capped a four-play, 66-yard drive in a 10-point third quarter 
for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints' touchdowns were an 11-yard pass from Bobby Hebert to Lonzell Hill 
in the first quarter and a three-yard run by Dalton Hilliard in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs, averaging almost six yards a carry and just under 120 yards a game, was 
held to 50 yards in 18 rushes. He had only 11 yards in 10 carries at halftime 
as New Orleans built a 14-3 lead.

KRIEG DOESN'T PASS UP CHANCE;

SEATTLE QUARTERBACK PICKS APART SECONDARY IN SECOND-HALF RALLY

<P>
Quarterback Dave Krieg of the Seattle Seahawks dropped back to pass from the 
19-yard line in the fourth quarter of Sunday's National Football League game 
against the Raiders at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Spotting wide receiver Brian Blades, who was being covered by Raider cornerback 
Mike Haynes, Krieg lofted a pass to Blades in the left corner of the end zone 
to give the Seahawks a 21-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bump and run and I just threw it up there and (Blades) ran underneath 
it," Krieg said. "It was a simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
The play turned out to be the winning touchdown in the Seahawks' 24-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Matched against Haynes for much of the game, Blades caught seven passes for 113 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Haynes have so much trouble covering Blades? Is Haynes still able to 
defend against receivers in single coverage? 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Haynes) is still a great corner," Blades said. "And he's still going 
to be a great corner until he retires." 
</P>
<P>
Krieg said he wasn't concentrating on Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't trying to pick on anyone, it just worked out that way," Krieg said. 
"I think Mike's still a good cornerback. Mike was all over Brian on the 
(touchdown)." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes wasn't the only Raider defensive back that Krieg burned. 
</P>
<P>
Krieg completed 22 of 31 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns. He has thrown 
11 touchdown passes in his last three games against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Krieg had an excellent game," Seattle Coach Chuck Knox said. "He put the 
ball on the money. He made some big plays. You can't ask him to do any more 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
Krieg is criticized for playing well with a lead, but being unable to rally a 
team. The Seahawks had lost 18 previous games in which they had trailed at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind 10-7 at halftime and 17-7 in the third quarter, Seattle 
rallied this time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in games where we tried to come back and we just came up a little 
bit short," Krieg said. "To come back in a game and win against the Raiders is 
a big victory for us. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten points isn't too big to overcome. When you get down by 13 or 14 it takes 
you out of your game plan, but 10 isn't any time to panic." 
</P>
<P>
Not the way Krieg was playing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After being held to 64 yards rushing in the first half, Krieg used play-action 
passes to open up the ground game. The Seahawks rushed for 96 yards in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Warner rushed for 76 of his season-high 102 yards in the second half, 
including a six-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
"Curt Warner had a big day today," Knox said. "He looked like the old Curt 
Warner." 
</P>
<P>
Warner was at his best in the fourth quarter, rushing for 39 yards on nine 
carries. Warner did most of the work in the Seahawks' final drive that ended in 
a 48-yard field goal by Norm Johnson with 1:15 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Curt was getting tired and he wanted to come off the field but we wouldn't let 
him," Krieg said. "He seems to run better when he's tired." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think too much," Warner said. "I start getting too analytical but 
when I get tired I don't think. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making up excuses. That's just the way it is. Sometimes I play better 
when I'm tired." 
</P>
<P>
With Warner and the ground game running smoothly, Krieg was also able to pass 
effectively, completing eight of 12 passes for 116 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time Dave is throwing the ball the way he was throwing today he's going to 
be a real good game," said Seahawk fullback John L. Williams, who caught six 
passes for 34 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Said Krieg: "The (offensive line) was getting pushed around a little bit in the 
first half and they started to push back in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who sacked Krieg three times for 23 yards in losses in the first 
half, sacked him only once in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Krieg is very aware of what's going on around him," Raider nose tackle Bob 
Golic said. "We had some halfway decent pressure on him, but he's a very 
experienced and very poised quarterback and he still gets the ball off." 
</P>
<P>
There's little doubt Krieg has helped make the difference for the Seahawks, who 
now have back-to-back victories. 
</P>
<P>
"People said let's write off the season after we started 0-2," Krieg said. "I 
can't understand why they were saying that. All I know is that you've got to 
just keep doing what you're doing and things will work themselves out." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy seems to be working for Krieg and the Seahawks at the moment.

SENNA GAINS ON PROST WITH WIN IN SPAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending world champion Ayrton Senna of Brazil has had a less than spectacular 
season on the Formula One circuit this season. 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly he is contending to defend his championship by winning the Spanish 
Grand Prix at Jerez de la Frontera Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, in a McLaren-Honda, completed 72 laps of the 2.62-mile circuit in 1 hour 
47 minutes 48.264 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Austria's Gerhard Berger, who trailed Senna from the start, was second, 27.051 
seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
Alain Prost, Senna's French teammate and main rival for the world drivers' 
title, was third, 53.788 seconds behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's victory, Senna has 60 points, closing on Prost, who leads the 
overall standings with 76. 
</P>
<P>
Senna must win both remaining races in Japan and Australia to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
Senna got a clean start and went ahead of Berger going into the first bend. 
</P>
<P>
And although the lanky Austrian virtually tailgated the McLaren-Honda for the 
first 30 laps, Senna did not seem to be challenged en route to his 20th Grand 
Prix victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I'm very happy, although I had a few gearbox and brake problems . . 
. I got the win, that was the goal," Senna said. 
</P>
<P>
France's Jean Alesi made an impressive showing finishing fourth, ahead of 
Riccardo Patrese. 
</P>
<P>
The Lola-Lamborghini team secured its first championship point with Frenchman 
Philippe Alliot's sixth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Prost drove a safe race, lagging behind the leaders and never challenging 
Berger, whose Ferrari engine started smoking in the 52nd lap. 
</P>
<P>
But the third-place finish was enough to keep the pressure on Senna for the 
last two races. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having serious gearbox problems and it was impossible o overtake Gerhard 
or Senna on this circuit," Prost said. "I would be happy if the championship 
had been decided today but as it hasn't, I have to go to Japan and Australia to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar driver Price Cobb worked his way through a pileup and held off division 
leader Chip Robinson to win the GTE World Challenge in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
After a caution period ended with six laps left in the 117-lap race, Robinson, 
the leader at the time, built up speed coming out of the final corner before 
the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson spun in the turn. Jaguar driver Jan Lammers, running second, 
crashed into the tire barriers trying to avoid the pileup and was forced out of 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb took the lead under a caution flag. Robinson's car was undamaged and he 
rejoined the field in fourth place, but sixth in line behind two lapped cars. 
</P>
<P>
When the race restarted with one lap left, Robinson shot through the pits at 
full speed and came out behind Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb finished less than a car-length in front of Robinson, but after the race 
Robinson's second-place finish was negated because he passed under the yellow 
flag and violated IMSA's conduct code in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
Dick LaHaie spoiled an impressive performance by Shirley Muldowney in winning 
the top fuel honors in a National Hot Rod Assn. race at Topeka, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
LaHaie completed the course in 5.076 seconds at 278.29 miles per hour in 
defeating Muldowney's quicker time of 5.072, 272.97 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
In the funny car category, Mark Oswald of Cincinnati defeated Ed McCulloch of 
Hemet.

KINGS END EXHIBITIONS ON A ROLL; 
</P>
<P>
THEY BEAT JETS, 4-1, EXTENDING STREAK TO THREE GAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
With a quick and easy 4-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets, the Kings wrapped up 
their exhibition season Sunday night before a sellout crowd of 18,115 at the 
San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Asked, as he had been at almost every stop of the Kings' exhibition tour, if he 
thought this city was a good candidate for National Hockey League expansion, 
Wayne Gretzky smiled and said: "We'd be the first team to vote yes." 
</P>
<P>
That from a man who has been living out of a suitcase for almost a month. A 
two-hour drive up the freeway, and he will be home tonight. An uncommon luxury 
now that he plays for the league's most-traveled franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings finished their 11-city barnstorming with a record of 5-4-1 -- winning 
their last three games -- and will take only one day off before getting in two 
days of practice for their Thursday opener against Toronto at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster said: "It's nice to get out of the preseason with no 
serious injuries. It's nice to end on a winning note. That's three in a row and 
puts us over .500." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings took a 3-0 lead in the first period. They scored with a two-man 
advantage on a shot by Petr Prajsler in the slot at 6:32. They followed up 
while the Jets still had one man in the penalty box with a goal by Gretzky, who 
knocked the puck into the net as it rolled off the back of goalie Daniel 
Berthiaume after a deflection at 8:03. 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli made the score 3-0, sweeping in the rebound of a shot by Keith 
Crowder as he skated in after the first volley. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets got their goal early in the second period from Mark Krumpel. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls added a goal at 11:23 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kings General Manager Rogie Vachon said Sunday night that he expected the Kings 
to lose a player or two in the waiver draft this afternoon, but that the Kings 
probably wouldn't pick up a player from another team. "Not as low as we're 
drafting," he said. "I would not expect anyone to still be there -- unless a 
team picks up a player and has to make available someone we're interested in. 
That is not likely." Vachon and the coaching staff will then spend much of the 
afternoon trimming the roster from 30 to about 25. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Mlakar, Kings executive vice president, is not the most popular person at 
the moment among the players, who had to play in 11 exhibition games in 11 
cities in the last couple of weeks. Mlakar, proclaiming the tour a financial 
success, said Sunday night that the Kings' had grossed $1 million on the five 
games that were their home games, the games at Cleveland, Cincinnati, Denver, 
Los Angeles and San Diego. Mlakar said that several more cities have expressed 
interest in playing host to King exhibition games next season -- Orlando, 
Ottawa, Seattle-Tacoma, Oakland, Dallas, Albany, Miami, Portland, and 
Worchester, Mass., as well as repeat interest from Cleveland and San Diego.

NEWSWIRE: EAST GERMAN BOXER DEFEATS CUBAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Maske of East Germany, moving up in weight, denied Pablo Romero of Cuba 
his third world amateur boxing championship Sunday night at Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Maske scored an 18-11 decision over Romero in the 178-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
Romero won gold medals at 178 in the world championships at Munich in 1982 and 
at Reno, Nev., 1986. Maske was a silver medalist in the 1986 championships and 
a gold-medal winner at the 1988 Olympics at 165 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Maske was the only one of five East German finalists to win. The Soviet Union 
won five gold medals, including four Sunday night, in the 12 finals held over 
two days. Cuba won four titles. Romania and the United States each won one.

CALCAVECCHIA'S VICTORY LEADS U.S. IN DUNHILL

<P>
Mark Calcavecchia won the only match that mattered Sunday, lifting the United 
States to a 3 1/2-2 1/2 victory over Japan in the final round of the Dunhill 
Cup at St. Andrews, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, in the first pairing of the afternoon matches, built a 
four-stroke lead after three holes and went on to a seven-shot triumph, his 
second victory of the day against overmatched Hajime Meshiai. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the United States an insurmountable 3 1/2- 1/2 lead and secured the 
Americans' first title in the five-year history of this medal-match play event. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, the British Open champion, had 12 birdies and an eagle in his 36 
holes over the Old Course and played those two rounds in 133, 11 under par. 
</P>
<P>
He beat Meshiai, 67-68, in the morning matches, then scored six birdies on the 
front nine in the afternoon and matched the best round of the tournament in a 
66-73 rout. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia's winning match was set up by Tom Kite's rally for a critical 
half-point in the morning half of the 36-hole final. 
</P>
<P>
Kite was two shots back with three holes to play against Naomichi Ozaki before 
he rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Kite hit a wedge to four feet for a birdie on the 16th to pull within one and 
flipped a sand wedge shot to four feet for the birdie that tied it on the 18th. 
Kite and Ozaki each had a four-under-par 68. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel capitalized on Pat Bradley's three-putt bogey on the 17th hole for 
a one-stroke victory in a $350,000 tournament at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel's victory, the fourth in her last six tournaments, earned her $48,750 
and pushed her over the $2-million mark for her career. After going winless for 
more than four years, Daniel has earned more than $500,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who began the day with a three-stroke lead over Bradley, shot a 73 and 
finished the 54-hole tournament at 205, tying the course record set by Jan 
Stephenson in 1987. Bradley shot a 71 to finish at 206. For the third 
consecutive day, they played in the same threesome. 
</P>
<P>
On the 17th hole, Daniel drove nearly out of bounds and left her approach shot 
40 yards short. But while Daniel went up-and-down to save par, Bradley 
three-putted from 45 feet, missing an eight-footer for par. 
</P>
<P>
"In that situation, I hate to see anybody lose," Daniel said after her 
wire-to-wire victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Charles of New Zealand shot a five-under-par 67 to win the Space Coast 
Senior PGA tournament at Melbourne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Charles had the final day's best round at the Suntree Country Club to win his 
fifth senior event of the season and $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
His 54-hole total of 13-under 203 was six shots ahead of runner-up Butch Baird. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Britton earned $135,000 for his first PGA tournament victory without 
having to lift a club as the final round of the $750,000 Centel tournament at 
Tallahassee, Fla. was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
Britton took a four-stroke lead with a nine-under-par 63 Saturday and finished 
54 holes with a 200.

GILBERT DOWNS JARRYD TO WIN FIFTH TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Third-seeded Brad Gilbert won his fifth singles title of the year before 
hometown fans by defeating unseeded Anders Jarryd of Sweden, 7-5, 6-2, in the 
$425,000 Volvo tennis tournament in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, of Piedmont, Calif., used a powerful serve, a pinpoint forehand and 
change of pace to beat Jarryd for the second time in as many weeks. Gilbert 
eliminated him at a tournament in Los Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
"My forehand was good but the key was that I played very aggressively in the 
big points," Gilbert said. "I got into the net and took some chances." 
</P>
<P>
Jarryd was pleased with his week's performance but remained puzzled on how to 
beat the world's No. 6 player. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to find the shot to beat him," Jarryd said. "He's so fast and he's 
always coming up with good passing shots. There are only a couple of guys who 
can do that. He returns well, too." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl, a master on the clay courts of France, played so well that even he 
was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
But his 6-2, 6-2 victory over Emilio Sanchez of Spain, also reminded Lendl of 
his French Open frustration this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I played like this at Roland Garros, I would have won that tournament," 
said Lendl, who lost in Paris to eventual French Open champion Michael Chang. 
"When you go out and hit the ball this well in a final, it's a nice feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Lendl had no trouble in the $250,000 tournament at Bordeaux, 
France. He broke Sanchez twice in the first set, coming up with a big serve and 
powerful forehands to force the pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Ivan played too good," said Sanchez, seeded second. "He hit too hard the whole 
match. His forehand was too good in the first set so, I tried to play his 
backhand." 
</P>
<P>
That tactic failed and Lendl easily won the second set, finishing the match in 
1 hour 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the ball today better than at Flushing Meadow," Lendl said, referring to 
the U.S. Open, where he lost to Boris Becker in the final. "It should translate 
into something good." 
</P>
<P>
This victory, which gave him his eighth tournament title of the year, was worth 
$45,000 and improved his year's earnings to more than $1.1 million, second only 
to Becker of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing in the fourth round to Chang at the French Open in June, Lendl has 
lost only three times, to Becker at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, and last week 
to Ecuador's Andres Gomez, in Lendl's first match on clay courts since the 
French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina needed a little less than two hours to 
defeat Paolo Cane of Italy, 6-1, 6-4, in the final of a $123,400 clay-court 
tournament at Palermo, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
John Lloyd rallied from a 5-3 deficit in the third set to defeat Bob Lutz, 4-6, 
6-1, 7-5, in the final of a $40,000 masters tournament in San Antonio.

DOOBIES' ROCK IS JUST ALL RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reunite a famous '60s band like the Who, the Jefferson Airplane or the Rolling 
Stones, and all sorts of questions arise about the propriety of honored 
innovators and standard-setters coming back to cash in with one last gravy run. 
</P>
<P>
But reunite a '70s band like the Doobie Brothers, and there's hardly a need to 
ask anything. 
</P>
<P>
The Doobies, like many of their high-profile '70s brethren, retreated from the 
'60s vision of rock as a cultural battlefield or a burgeoning movement to be 
infused with high creative ideals. The group, which took its name from a slang 
term for a marijuana cigarette, saw rock as a backing track for an easygoing 
good time. The one-time bar band from San Jose never sang about how the storm 
was threatening their very life today, or about people putting down their 
generation. No, the most telling line from the Doobies' signature song, "Listen 
to the Music," went: "What the people need is a way to make 'em smile / It 
ain't so hard to do if you know how." 
</P>
<P>
Given that limited vision, the reunited Doobie Brothers don't have to carry the 
extra musical burdens under which the returning '60s vets have labored. The 
only question they had to answer Friday at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa 
Mesa was the one common to all bar bands and nostalgia acts: Do they still have 
the skill and enthusiasm to breathe momentary freshness into a batch of old 
favorites? 
</P>
<P>
The answer was good enough to get a few thousand nostalgic thirtysomething 
types up and dancing through much of the Doobies' brisk, 90-minute set of 
faithfully rendered hits. Led by Patrick Simmons and Tom Johnston, the band's 
two founding singer-guitarists, the nine-man lineup capably reproduced the 
distinctive high-wall-of-voices harmonies, rolling rhythms and commercially 
glossy synthesis of country, soul and rock 'n' roll roots. 
</P>
<P>
The Doobies did play six songs from their successful reunion album, "Cycles." 
But the new material hews to the band's old style, the Doobies having been 
sufficiently honest -- and market-savvy -- to stick with proven old ways 
instead of trying to sound falsely "contemporary." Certain songs from "Cycles" 
convey a depth that the Doobie Brothers' early music lacked, a sense of life 
lived with struggles and disappointments. Otherwise, it was pretty much 
good-times as usual for the Doobies, a way to make the people smile. 
</P>
<P>
While the "Cycles" lineup is drawn from the Doobies' early '70s incarnation 
that centered on Simmons and Johnston, the show included a few songs from the 
later period marked by Michael McDonald's sophisticated white-soul style 
(McDonald, the only Doobie Brother who went on to solo success in the '80s, is 
not part of the reunion). Sidemen Cornelius Bumpus (a late-period Doobie) and 
Richard Bryant helped carry the McDonald songs off, but the Doobies were at 
their best with more rocking material, including feisty renditions of such 
chestnuts as "Rockin' Down the Highway," "Jesus Is Just Alright" and "Long 
Train Runnin'." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons and Johnston had little to say in perfunctory song introductions, but 
they probably realized that their repertoire alone was enough to give the show 
a ready-made sense of connection and familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is the problem with rock nostalgia: The whole experience is 
ready-made. Real excitement comes from watching a band -- whether new or old -- 
that still has the capacity to surprise itself and its audience. The Doobies 
can't be accused of playing by rote. But, Friday, the Doobies' safe, familiar 
rock was just alright -- and that's about all.

Patrons at Matt's Saloon in Prescott, Ariz., couldn't believe their luck when 
rock superstar Bruce Springsteen arrived by motorcycle unannounced, ordered a 
beer and wound up in a one-hour jam session with the house band. Springsteen 
drove up to the country-Western bar in northwestern Arizona on Friday en route 
to the Grand Canyon from Los Angeles. Denny Orr, rhythm guitarist for The Mile 
High Band, said he noticed Springsteen enter the bar and "the next thing I 
knew, he said, 'Come on, boys. Let's jam.' " Springsteen played "I'm on Fire" 
from his 1984 multiplatinum "Born in the USA" album plus several covers of 
oldies such as "Don't Be Cruel," "Sweet Sixteen" and "Route 66." Springsteen, 
wearing a leather vest and a bandanna around his neck, "was having a good time, 
talking to the regulars and drinking beer before word spread and the bar's 
attendance swelled "from 7 or 8 people to 80 or 90 in 10 minutes," Orr said. 
After the jam session, Springsteen dodged autograph-seekers, jumped on his 
motorcycle and roared up U.S. 89 trailed by his four bodyguards -- three on 
cycles and another in a van. Claudia Puig

Romanian lyric soprano Ileana Cotrubas, one of the world's leading opera 
singers, announced her retirement on Friday from the stage at London's Royal 
Opera House during a rehearsal. An opera house news release said Cotrubas, 50, 
plans to hold farewell concerts in opera houses with which she has special 
relationships before taking up a new career as a singing teacher. Cotrubas, who 
lives in Monte Carlo, was one of the most vocally and dramatically versatile 
artists to emerge in the 1960s. She has had opera engagements throughout 
Europe, the United States and Japan since then. "I always intended to retire 
early, rather than too late. All my operatic ambitions have been fulfilled and 
I really have no further interest in performance," the singer told a reporter. 
"What I want to do now is pass on some of my knowledge to younger singers."

Two ABC Wednesday-night, half-hour sitcoms will switch time periods this week, 
network officials announced. "Anything but Love," which stars Jamie Lee Curtis 
and Richard Lewis as colleagues at a Chicago magazine, was in a 9 p.m. slot. It 
will be broadcast at 9:30 p.m. beginning Wednesday. "Doogie Howser, M.D.," 
which debuted Sept. 19 and stars Neil Patrick Harris as a brilliant teen-age 
physician, will move to 9 p.m. "We are pleased with the performance of both 
shows so far this season," said Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment. 
"However, we want to take advantage of the inherent younger appeal of 'Doogie 
Howser' while maximizing 'Anything but Love's' excellent adult appeal," Iger 
said. Claudia Puig

An Oklahoma television viewer wants so badly to see "The Last Temptation of 
Christ" that he is suing a cable company that decided not to show the 
controversial film. Felix H. Olim of suburban Midwest City filed suit Friday in 
federal court to force Multimedia Cablevision to show the film on Cinemax when 
it is telecast for the rest of the country. He also wants $1 million in 
damages. Multimedia announced last week that it would not telecast the 
controversial film in Oklahoma, Kansas and North Carolina when it appears on 
the premium channel. Olim's suit says Multimedia "infringed upon the religious 
rights of its 90,000 subscribers" by deciding to pre-empt the program. Cinemax 
will broadcast the movie nationwide Monday and on four other dates in October. 
The Oscar-nominated "Last Temptation" sparked national protests when it was 
released 14 months ago because it portrayed Jesus as confused over his identity 
and purpose and subject to human desires. Claudia Puig

DANCE REVIEW;

<P>
CHOREOGRAPHER ADRIA WILSON AT WESTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adria Wilson, who self-produced a program called "Art in Motion" Saturday at 
the Westside Academy of Dance, boasts many ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder at that. As a CalArts graduate, Wilson has been exposed to the 
avant-garde. As a TV and night-club performer she bears commercial influences. 
She has also taught dance and appeared in Helsinki and Tokyo, which gives her 
an international breadth. 
</P>
<P>
But few of these experiences coalesced into a smoothly sophisticated or even 
artistically savvy whole for this eight-member ad-hoc group. 
</P>
<P>
In "Preliminary" -- a strange and stilted title for dirty dancin' to a fusion 
salsa beat -- Wilson had her best shot. Here she outfitted the ensemble in chic 
street wear, and the dancers finally did not look like trick-or-treaters. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, their sequence was so brief and under-rehearsed that it failed to 
end the evening on a triumphant note, even without a timing snafu in the 
blackout climax. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the dancer-choreographer either squandered her ideas or didn't think 
them through. In "Spider," she let glitzy show-biz effects undermine Matt 
Easton's atmospheric score. Otherwise this portrait of a Black Widow might have 
conjured the arachnid menace she had in mind -- especially with the 
considerable talent of Kenneth Bowman and Theodora M. Fredericks, whose 
long-limbed entanglings looked positively deadly. 
</P>
<P>
"Piece of a Dream," however, was hopelessly sophomoric and confused. Actor Ron 
Mesa's virtuosic delivery of his Mephistophelean monologue did little to pull 
this hocus-pocus, balloon-and-smoke bonanza out of its embarrassing 
pretensions. DONNA PERLMUTTER

L.A. BAROQUE ORCHESTRA OPENS FOURTH SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The intrepid Gregory Maldonado and his band of antiquarians, the Los Angeles 
Baroque Orchestra, opened their fourth season on Friday at St. Paul's Lutheran 
Church in Santa Monica with an overly ambitious program of 17th- and 
18th-Century instrumental music for the theaters of London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The strain imposed by the evening's length and the jungle heat of St. Paul's 
ultimately savaged the violins' gut strings, the oboes' intonation and the 
players' concentration in what had begun as a noble, stylish performance of a 
26-movement(!) suite from Rameau's opera "Les Indes Galantes." 
</P>
<P>
The concert began promisingly. The orchestra, 20 strong and led, as ever, from 
the concertmaster's chair by Maldonado, quickly settled into a characterful 
suite from Thomas Arne's "The Judgement of Paris" with execution that was, for 
the most part, energetic and orderly. 
</P>
<P>
A hyper-extended sequence of snippets from Lully's "Bourgeois Gentilhomme" 
needed rhythmic tightening and, perhaps, even (blasphemy!) a two-handed 
conductor. But there were rewards in the neatly turned violin duet of Maldonado 
and Jolianne von Einem, the ethereal tones coaxed by Stephen Schultz from his 
keyless (wooden) transverse flute, and Edward Murray's imaginatively realized 
harpsichord continuo. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, the evening belonged to Purcell and the grand airs from 
his "King Arthur" -- a welcome, robust antidote to the French composers' 
incessant gracefulness. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell, too, was accorded the most consistent playing of the evening: firm in 
ensemble and intonation, broad, even sentimental, in the sublime "Bright Nymphs 
of Britain" melody and the "Symphony," with its haunting violin 
arabesques.HERBERT GLASS

'CRY FOR HELP': POWERFUL DEPICTION OF TRUE-LIFE TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many a TV movie has examined abusive husbands and battered wives, but seldom 
with as much ferocity as in "A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story" (at 9 
tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39). 
</P>
<P>
This one goes beyond the usual psychological issues and violent incidents to 
examine the police response to such crimes. The real Thurman sued the police in 
her hometown of Torrington, Conn., charging that they hadn't sufficiently 
protected her from her estranged spouse, whose 1983 attack left her partially 
paralyzed. The federal court decision in Thurman's favor triggered a nationwide 
trend toward pro-arrest policies in domestic violence cases. 
</P>
<P>
Her story is particularly timely in Los Angeles, where Maria Navarro was slain 
last month after she warned authorities, in a fruitless 911 emergency call, 
that her husband was on his way to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Sullivan's script is not a thing of beauty. It includes a stiff 
flashback-within-a-flashback, and it skips too lightly over the period 
preceding the Thurmans' nuptials; considering that Buck Thurman had already 
begun the abuse, we need a better explanation of why his victim chose to marry 
him. Later, the police testimony is given extremely short shrift. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sullivan has written several very deft scenes, such as one in which 
Tracey overreacts to the sight of her young son holding a paring knife. And 
even though the scene in which Buck stabs Tracey is awkwardly previewed at the 
beginning of the film, the complete version is still a not-for-the-squeamish 
barn burner when it finally hits the screen. Robert Markowitz's staging of this 
scene is harrowingly effective. 
</P>
<P>
So are Nancy McKeon and Dale Midkiff as the ill-fated couple. These are 
performances of documentary-like veracity and power. DON SHIRLEY

CHINA'S PEOPLE COME INTO FOCUS IN 'RED DYNASTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To mark the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic of China this month, the 
Arts &amp; Entertainment network is launching a three-part series, "Red 
Dynasty," with the help of the veteran documentary makers at the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
The first hour runs tonight at 6 with a repeat at 10 on A&amp;E, then once more 
Sunday at 8 a.m. The other episodes will run in the same time slots in 
consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The programs bring to mind our grand national lack of information about this 
mass of people. We knew all about egg rolls and won ton soup -- but with the 
massacre at Tian An Men Square , we seemed to discover that there was a whole 
country there. So we were inundated with hot bulletins and news specials and 
assorted explorations by the media. But, like the proverbial Chinese meal, it 
left us hungry for more. 
</P>
<P>
With only three hours, this series (the third episode, on the turmoil in rural 
Chinese life, wasn't screened) doesn't add particular volumes to the subject, 
except to bring clarity to incredible complexities, much to the credit of 
writer-narrator Edward Behr. The series has the usual steady, tasteful, almost 
incredibly understated tone of the usual BBC historicals, no matter what the 
ferocious events being portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
The first episode, "Sons of the Revolution," goes back through old film to 
trace apocalyptic events, including the legendary "Long March" in 1934 when the 
communist forces fled Chiang Kai-shek across the landscape. Supposedly 4,000 of 
the 80,000 survived, including the genius Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping, who 
would engineer the slaughter of last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Part 2, "The Legacy," is full of terrible ironies. The BBC set out to make a 
film on the future of China -- "but that was no longer possible," said narrator 
Behr. Crews had been following selected observers who could trace the great 
gains of the People's Republic in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
But with the protest euphoria at its height, during a supper with some of the 
BBC subjects being filmed, one of them reflects on how happy people are these 
days, how people are uncommonly smiling in the streets.

PBS TAKES A WRONG TURN WITH NEW 'TRAVELS' SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging from the first and third episodes of PBS' new "Travels" series (9 p.m. 
on Channel 28, 8 p.m. on Channel 15), you'd be better off watching "2 on the 
Town." 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's opener, "The Waters Are Wide: A Journey to Tristan da Cunha," 
we're stuck on a mail boat with series executive producer John Heminway on the 
way to the South Atlantic's most remote island. Once we get there, Heminway 
notes, the small community treats him like an intruder. No wonder, considering 
that the first question we see our host asking a native on a lonely road is 
"Where are you taking those cattle?" -- followed by "Where are you taking them 
from?" 
</P>
<P>
Like "Great Railways" and other such (superior) highfalutin travel series, this 
initial episode of "Travels" is one of those "personal journeys" that depend as 
much on who's taking us along as on where we're going. And because Heminway is 
a dull, awkward, slightly pretentious guide, the series gets off to a dull, 
awkward, slightly pretentious start. 
</P>
<P>
The second episode was not made available, but the third, "East Meets Wax," 
doesn't offer much hope of improvement. This time around it's an obscure 
comedian, Ruby Wax, who takes us to Moscow to watch her try her shtick on the 
Soviets. Even before being mangled by her translator/foil, her lines aren't 
funny. Maybe that's why the show's tone suddenly shifts to dull seriousness as 
she discusses the housing problem with a resident. 
</P>
<P>
At least the third episode, unlike the first, is intentionally bizarre. Other 
"Travels" may prove more rewarding, but be sure to pack your life preserver. 
You may want to jump ship before long on this trip. TERRY ATKINSON

BORDER HAS WORST OF BOTH WORLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

EL PASO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each day, a reeking, contaminated ditch known as the Black Water is sprayed 
with insecticide to kill disease-carrying mosquitoes. The ditch is in Mexico, 
but the spraying is done by an employee of El Paso County across the border. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Mexican health officials can't do it because they have neither the 
money nor the manpower. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south on the border, at Laredo, 25 million gallons of raw sewage are 
pumped daily into the Rio Grande River from Nuevo Laredo, the city on the 
Mexican side. Half of Nuevo Laredo's 30 garbage dumps are along the river, 
further contaminating the water until it is little more than a carcinogenic 
liqueur. Swimming downstream from Laredo is banned. Yet it is used for drinking 
water on both sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Polluted 
</P>
<P>
The New River, which flows from Mexicali to the Salton Sea in California, is 
the most polluted in the country because of the sewage and toxins dumped into 
it from the Mexican side. 
</P>
<P>
El Paso County alone has more tuberculosis cases than were reported in 19 
American states last year and the rate of infectious hepatitis is five times 
the national norm. The tuberculosis rate in Southern California is higher than 
the national norm and many believe the reason is the proximity to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a double whammy we're looking at along the border," said Dr. Herbert 
Ortega, director of the El Paso office of the Pan American Health Organization. 
"We've got diseases of the First World and the Third World." 
</P>
<P>
While the attention on the border has been focused on drugs and illegal 
immigration in recent years, populations immediately along the boundary are 
swelling at an astonishing rate, causing a myriad of health, environmental and 
educational problems, raising at least the specter that the border is becoming 
this country's new Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Colonias' Spring Up 
</P>
<P>
And nowhere is it more evident than in Texas, where unauthorized subdivisions 
known as "colonias" have sprung up as adjuncts of the hardscrabble poor U.S. 
border cities. Here along the U.S. side, an estimated 140,000 people have 
bought small parcels of land and tried to build something -- anything -- as a 
home along dirt roads, seeking the promise of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to all the pollution stemming from the Mexican side, they live 
without running water or sewers. Commonly, the shallow wells dug for water have 
been contaminated by nearby septic tanks. Yet people continue to bathe and cook 
with the water. In one rural colonia, two-thirds of the residents contracted 
hepatitis by the time they were 35. 
</P>
<P>
And the people keep coming. In 1900, there were about 36,000 people living 
along the U.S.-Mexican border, with half of them living in El Paso and Juarez. 
Today, an estimated 6 million people live along the 2,000-mile boundary. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1975 and 1985, the population of Juarez increased by 134%, while El 
Paso, the largest American city directly on the border, grew by 32%. The town 
of Soccoro, just to the east of El Paso, has grown from a sleepy hamlet of 
1,500 in 1980 to an overcrowded 25,000 today, many of them living in colonias. 
The same story is echoed all along the Texas border, where, unlike California, 
loose zoning laws and the proximity of large American cities has spawned 
hundreds of the colonias. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing monumental environmental health problems on both sides of the 
border because of the tremendous population growth, mostly on the Mexican 
side," said Jose (Pepe) Gonzales, director of the Laredo-Webb County Health 
Department. The populations there overwhelm the capability of Mexican health 
and sanitation efforts, and push ever higher the number of poor immigrants 
seeking relief just across the river in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poorest Cities 
</P>
<P>
Four of the five poorest cities in the nation are strung out along the Texas 
border. Yet, from the south side of the Rio Grande, those same cities can look 
like nirvana, given the devastated state of the Mexican economy. The value of 
the Mexican peso, for example, is now 2,500 per dollar, compared to a 12-1 
exchange rate in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
To further complicate matters, the main provider of jobs along the Mexican side 
of the border has also become a part of the problem. Foreign-operated 
manufacturing plants called maquiladoras, which assemble goods for the U.S. 
market with low-cost Mexican labor, have become a magnet to thousands of people 
in the Mexican interior. Some of the plants are also said to be dumping toxic 
chemicals into both the Rio Grande and New River, as well as Mexican landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems are big and they are going to get worse," said Dr. Laurance 
Nickey, the El Paso County health director. "People are coming here looking to 
improve their own lot in life and you can't blame them for it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the other America," said Nickey. "There's going to come a point in time, 
if we let it go, where it can't be fixed." 
</P>
<P>
The people who live in colonias on the U.S. side, most of them Americans of 
Mexican descent, have moved in as rents and crime have increased in the 
American border cities. And, for many, a home in the colonias is the 
fulfillment of the American dream, giving them the chance to own their own plot 
of ground. 
</P>
<P>
In El Paso County alone there are more than 400 such subdivisions that dot the 
scrub landscape outside the city limits. By one estimate, 30,000 homes are 
without water and 53,000 are without sewers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Water 
</P>
<P>
Lorenza and Amadeo Contreras, for example, live in a very comfortable home that 
just happens to have no water service, and they have also managed to send two 
sons to M.I.T. to study engineering. 
</P>
<P>
But too often, those who live in colonias have been the victims of unscrupulous 
developers, who sold land first and promised that water and sewers would come 
later. Neither came, but by then too many payments had been made on the land, 
too much work and money had gone into building the house. 
</P>
<P>
It has spawned a people whose children want to have school gym class first 
thing in the morning so they can have their shower for the day. And it has also 
placed a great burden on poor school systems ill-equipped to handle a constant 
stream of new students. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of what one must do to live in a colonia is the routine of Juan 
Solares, who fills barrels with water in El Paso, then siphons it to a tank on 
his roof. His wife must use the same water to do several loads of wash by hand. 
It is not uncommon to see people using 55-gallon drums that once contained 
toxic chemicals to store their water. 
</P>
<P>
In the so-called Sparks colonia near El Paso, shacks and trailers dot the dusty 
landscape and people have built houses where they are susceptible to mudslides. 
Ironically, there is a state-of-the-art sewage treatment plant that can be seen 
from the colonia, but it is only for the well-heeled retirement community -- 
complete with golf course -- on the other side of the hill. Sewage overflows 
from that plant and runs through the colonia when there are heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
Colonias have been around El Paso since the 1960s. As they continued to grow in 
the county, where municipal governments had no zoning authority, the local 
water utility had to take notice. In 1979, it passed a moratorium on all water 
hookups to colonias, hoping that the subdivisions would go away when deprived 
of basic services. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they continued to grow, not only here but all along the Texas border. 
And because so many years have gone by without hookups, the needs have become 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just 4 Hookups 
</P>
<P>
In the forefront of the drive to obtain water and sewer hookups in El Paso is a 
group known as the El Paso Interreligious Sponsoring Organization. One of the 
leaders of that organization is Father Ed Roden, a Catholic priest who has 
devoted nine years to the rights of people living in the colonias. The result: 
four hookups, all of them this summer. Excess paper work is the reason given by 
officials as to why more people do not have water. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only a show," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, some hope for the residents of the colonias. Texans will 
vote in November on a bond election for $500 million worth of water and sewer 
improvements. Of that, $100 million is earmarked specifically for the 
improvement of colonias along the border. The bond issue has the support of all 
major state officials, but there is still fear that the bill will be lost in a 
long list of measures that will be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"If that fails, it will set us back light years," said Father Roden. 
</P>
<P>
Nickey, the El Paso County health director, has told this story so often he is 
tired of it; it is a good story nonetheless: On a biting cold winter day, he 
was driving an Environmental Protection Agency employee to the top of a 
mountain overlooking El Paso. When they got to the top, the EPA employee was 
aghast. Before him was a scene unlike any he had ever seen before. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of plumes of smoke were rising from homes, then melding into an ugly 
gray cloud that blanketed the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't you the health authority in El Paso?," the EPA man asked. "Why don't 
you do something?" 
</P>
<P>
"There are two reasons," Nickey replied. "The first is that young mothers are 
trying to keep their babies from freezing and the second is that I would be 
invading a foreign country," since much of the smoke came from factories and 
homes in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suitably Humbled 
</P>
<P>
The EPA man was suitably humbled. But it is yet another example of how Mexico's 
problems have become problems for the United States as well. And while the 
obstacles are staggering, there are some hopeful signs. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has appropriated $25 million to be used for the construction of a 
sewage treatment plant in Nuevo Laredo, provided Mexico puts up matching money. 
The Texas Legislature approved spending $5 million on the same project. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has made $5.5 million available to assist in 
water and sewer hookups for colonias. The federal and California governments 
have been negotiating with Mexico to build a sewage treatment plant in Tijuana. 
Democratic Rep. Ronald D. Coleman of El Paso has introduced two bills in 
Congress designed to help colonias and development along the border. Stronger 
water and sewer laws are in force in El Paso County. 
</P>
<P>
The likes of Nickey and Gonzales want to see a strong bi-national organization 
to deal with the border problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have an organization with the power to act on either side," said 
Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, of the Pan American Health Organization, wants the owners of the border 
factories to take more responsibility for the state of the border cities. And 
then there is Dr. Robert Bernstein, the director of the Texas State Health 
Department. He wants action, now. 
</P>
<P>
"The border has been studied to death," he said. "We know what the problems 
are. It's time we do something."

HIGH POVERTY RATE PERSISTS FOR CHILDREN 
</P>

Despite the economic recovery of the 1980s, millions of children in the United 
States remain in poverty, "unhealthy, uneducated and unable to participate in 
the highly technological economy of the future," according to a far-reaching 
congressional report released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of all children, 50% of black children and one-fourth of all 
preschoolers live in poverty, according to the report. Children -- especially 
young children -- continue to be the single largest poverty group in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families said 
that there has been "no progress in increasing the proportion of pregnant women 
who receive appropriate prenatal care" and that the proportion of low birth 
weight babies has increased. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Compounded 
</P>
<P>
"The persistent problems of poverty and poor health are compounded by alarming 
rises in homelessness, youth violence and the emergence of drug addiction and 
AIDS among babies," the report also noted. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House committee, called the 
report "a portrait of America's children" and added: "But this is not a 
portrait signed by Norman Rockwell. This is a very troubling picture. What you 
end up with is the dark side . . . of economic recovery." 
</P>
<P>
The report, one of the most comprehensive ever to document the current economic 
conditions and trends affecting U.S. children and families, is the third in a 
series compiled by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
What is especially disturbing, Miller said, is that the latest report reflects 
an increase in the same ominous trends as the two earlier reports, issued in 
1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The gloomy trends documented in the first two studies were frequently dismissed 
"as part of the recession," or as the result of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration's attempt to cut back many social programs, Miller said. 
However, he said, it is more difficult to fix blame now that "we see that these 
things are continuing, and they are profound and massive." 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't see anything on the horizon that's going to change them," he 
added. "When will this constituency be strong enough to be heard? Politicians 
either do not hear them, or they are hearing them so slowly that the trends are 
overwhelming us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Besieged by Poverty 
</P>
<P>
A "significant portion" of American families and "millions of our youngest 
children" have been "besieged by higher rates of poverty and low rates of 
health insurance," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Increases in childhood poverty in the 1970s and 1980s have generally 
corresponded with periods of recession in the national economy," the report 
said. "However, despite the economic growth of recent years, child poverty 
rates have declined only slightly." For Latino children, the report said, "they 
have not declined at all." 
</P>
<P>
Median family income has increased slightly since 1985, but is still below 1970 
levels, "in real terms," the report said. Family incomes of black and Latino 
children have continued to decline, the report said. Overall, the median family 
income of white children is more than 1 3/4 times that of Latino children, and 
double that of black children, the report said. Between 1970 and 1987, the 
median income of children living in single-parent families declined by 19%, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Among low-income families with children, average family income declined 14% 
between 1979 and 1987, compared with a 19% increase for the highest-income 
families, according to the study. In 1988, 20% of all children had no form of 
private or public health insurance, compared to 17% in 1982, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prenatal Care 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the report said, one birth in 17 was to a mother who received late 
prenatal care, or none at all. Among black babies, the ratio was one in nine 
and among Latinos, one in eight, according to the report. Moreover, progress in 
reducing the infant mortality rate slowed in the course of the 1980s, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller called the trends "a national tragedy" that will "require the 
mobilization of all of our resources." He said his priority would be "to 
continue to concentrate on whether we can launch healthy children into this 
world. I would concentrate on children 0 through 6." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "What this report says is that we're essentially launching these 
children on courses of failure. (But) . . . minor course corrections at the 
start of a child's life can dramatically alter the outcome and change the 
course these children will take." 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded: "Statistics may appear cold and impersonal, but they 
depict a reality which calls for action. The numbers presented in this report 
and its predecessors tell us that not just for one or two years, but day after 
day in this decade, children continue to be assaulted by volatile economic and 
social forces."

TUESDAY'S VOTE IS A HIGH-STAKE GAMBLE FOR CATHEDRAL CITY MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CATHEDRAL CITY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1987, businessman George Hardie decided to build a card parlor on a chunk of 
land he owns in this desert community next door to Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
But when Hardie -- managing partner of the Bicycle Club casino in Bell Gardens 
-- shared his plans with a few City Council members, he got the cold shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Never one to back down with a whimper, Hardie figured if you can't beat 'em, 
join 'em. He bought a condominium in Cathedral City and ran for City Council. 
Mounting an expensive campaign, he won a seat in April, 1988, and was promptly 
named mayor by his council colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Before his freshman year was half over, Hardie, 55, had resurrected his card 
parlor proposal. He then launched a petition drive that landed a measure on the 
ballot to legalize casinos in Cathedral City. 
</P>
<P>
The denouement to this tale comes Tuesday, when voters here will decide whether 
to permit people to play cards for money in their town. While the gambling 
issue itself is controversial, more than that is at stake: In a sense, the 
special election is a referendum on George Hardie, Mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"It is (about) me, absolutely," Hardie acknowledged last week in an interview 
at his plush, wood-paneled office above the Bicycle Club's jam-packed gaming 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
His opponents agree: "The issue is Hardie," said Anne Zachary, 71, a 
coordinator of anti-gambling forces in Cathedral City. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a carpetbagger, a smart businessman who came in here determined to get 
his casino built. But I think he misjudged this community. . . . We're not that 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Two measures are on Tuesday's ballot. The first would repeal Cathedral City's 
current ban on card-room gambling and the second would regulate the games. If 
voters approve, draw poker, lowball, pan and other games allowed under 
California law could be played 24 hours a day by those 21 and older. No Las 
Vegas-style gambling would be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Only one gaming license for every 25,000 residents -- there are about 29,000 
people in Cathedral City today -- could be issued under the regulations, and a 
companion hotel development would be required along with any card parlor built. 
Up to 10% of the gaming revenue earned annually would be shared with the city. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Hardie's proposal for a $25-million hotel and gaming complex -- the 
Emerald Court Resort -- on land he owns in the center of town is the only plan 
tailored to the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign over the gambling measures has been a nasty one, waged with verve 
despite the blistering desert sun. 
</P>
<P>
Gambling foes have invoked God, the Bible and traditional values in their 
battle to keep card parlors out of town. On the other side, Hardie and his 
followers have borrowed from Voltaire -- the French satirist who railed against 
religious intolerance -- to argue that the issue is a matter of freedom of 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of card parlors have accused Hardie of using his office merely to 
expand his gaming empire, while the mayor has called anti-gambling forces 
"loonies" who want "everybody to go to bed at 8 o'clock every night." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shadowed by Detectives 
</P>
<P>
Tactics have often been imaginative. One anti-gambling crusader said she and 
her family were trailed for a month by private investigators but it was never 
learned who hired the detectives. More recently, Hardie and his Cathedral City 
home were monitored by opponents, who unveiled their finding at a press 
conference and accused him of being an "absentee mayor." 
</P>
<P>
The latest campaign twist came when Hardie suggested that a form letter he 
received from Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp proved that the state's top law 
enforcement official has no problem with card clubs. The letter, which Hardie 
displayed during a televised debate, asked the mayor to support Van de Kamp in 
his gubernatorial race. That invitation was withdrawn, however, when Van de 
Kamp learned that Mayor George Hardie was the same George Hardie who manages 
the Bicycle Club. The attorney general's campaign manager labeled Hardie's use 
of the letter "a questionable tactic." 
</P>
<P>
Hardie and the 40 Southern California investors seeking to build the Cathedral 
City resort have provided almost all of the financing for the pro-gambling 
forces, who had raised $187,600 as of the most recent campaign disclosure 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Although hopeful his development will be profitable, Hardie says self-interest 
is not his main motivation in pushing the initiative. Instead, he said, 
Cathedral City -- a rapidly growing community with few tax-generating 
businesses to support its swelling municipal budget -- needs the jobs and 
estimated $604,000 in annual net revenue that would be generated by the card 
club. 
</P>
<P>
Long viewed as the "poor stepchild" of the Coachella Valley, Cathedral City 
needs a resort with unique appeal to help it compete for tourists with better 
known neighboring cities, Hardie argues. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents -- who have raised about $45,000 -- say Hardie's got it all wrong. 
Permitting gambling will harm property values, deter vacationing families and 
usher in a host of "unsavory characters" who will make Cathedral City's streets 
unsafe, said Carol Engelhard, 37, a mother of three and a leading anti-gambling 
crusader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Frightening' 
</P>
<P>
"This thing would be half a mile from a brand-new elementary school. Half a 
mile," said Engelhard, whose group was launched with $5,000 from the 
Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, an activist religious group best 
known for its fervent crusades against abortion and homosexuality. "To think of 
gamblers drinking all day and then driving down streets our children cross, 
it's frightening." 
</P>
<P>
A primary theme in the gambling debate has been Hardie's performance as mayor. 
For starters, his critics maintain that it is inappropriate for Hardie to serve 
as the city's top elected official while pushing a ballot measure that would 
benefit him personally. Hardie disagrees, as did the city attorney in an 
opinion earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Others complain that the mayor runs the city from his casino in Bell Gardens -- 
requiring expensive long-distance phone calls between him and city staff -- and 
spends little time mixing with local citizens. A member of one anti-gambling 
group staked out Hardie's condominium and found he spent just six nights there 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie, who has a home in Downey, counters that most people leave Cathedral 
City "when it's 120 degrees in August" and argues that he is more accessible 
than any previous mayor of the city, which incorporated in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sincerity Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Other detractors question Hardie's sincerity, charging that he ran for mayor 
merely to boost his chances of building a casino in town. As Engelhard sees it, 
Hardie is an exploiter using Cathedral City as a "testing ground" before 
expanding gambling ventures to other communities. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie rejects that contention, insisting his political career has nothing to 
do with card parlors. As for his critics' predictions that he seeks to launch 
gaming clubs in other cities around California, Hardie says that is true. 
Indeed, he recently formed a political action committee to make donations to 
state lawmakers who might support legislation favorable to the gambling 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, however, believes his business ventures deserve praise, not 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking in other cities, wherever there's an opportunity," he said, 
declining to disclose any prospective card club locations. "I don't believe 
there are any limits. I admire people who try to achieve. Who moves the world 
forward? People like me, entrepreneurs who risk and try to make life better."

GOVERNOR OKS INSURANCE AID TO CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS VICTIMS

<P>
People who suffer from AIDS, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and other serious 
illnesses will be able to purchase health insurance for the first time through 
a state-subsidized program under legislation signed Sunday by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
After years of vetoing similar bills, the governor approved a compromise 
catastrophic health insurance program that will rely on tobacco tax revenues to 
aid as many as 300,000 uninsured Californians who suffer from such long-term 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's approval of the health care bill came as he took action on dozens 
of bills, including signing a measure that will impose a tough new drunk 
driving standard on truck drivers and commercial boat operators by reducing the 
legal blood alcohol level from .10% to .04%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DMV Release of Addresses 
</P>
<P>
And in the hope of preventing another murder like that of actress Rebecca 
Schaeffer in July, the governor signed a bill restricting the release of home 
addresses by the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
He also signed legislation to help finance construction of an Olympic athlete 
training center in southern San Diego County. It will be financed by a loan 
from the state and repaid through the sale of commemorative Olympic license 
plates for $100 per pair. 
</P>
<P>
But once again, the governor vetoed legislation that would have required all 
students in grades 7-12 to receive AIDS prevention instruction unless their 
parents specifically object to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Our schools are aware of the importance of this instruction and are responding 
appropriately to the challenge without the additional programs and mandated 
costs that this bill would create," the governor said in his veto message. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor's decision to sign the catastrophic health insurance 
bill came after years of wrangling over who should pay the cost of caring for 
devastating illnesses such as AIDS and cancer that can bankrupt patients who do 
not have health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) was able to negotiate a 
compromise by proposing that the state pay for the program with an estimated 
$30 million in interest on revenues from Proposition 99, the tobacco tax 
increase approved by voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the bill provides for fewer benefits than those contained in 
measures vetoed by the governor in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejected Advice 
</P>
<P>
In signing the Isenberg bill, Deukmejian rejected the urgings of some of his 
own health and finance advisers, who had opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 244,000 to 300,000 Californians who are unable to 
purchase health insurance because they have such conditions as cancer, heart 
disease, AIDS, diabetes, lupus or epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
But the number of them able to purchase the state-subsidized insurance could be 
limited by the high premiums, estimated to range from $1,300 to $3,500 a year 
when the program gets under way in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's approval of stricter standards for drinking by truck drivers comes 
just two weeks after he signed a measure reducing the drunk driving standard 
for all motor vehicle operators from .10% to .08%. 
</P>
<P>
The latest measure by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) would impose the .04% 
standard on all commercial vehicle drivers, including boat and ship operators. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which will take effect Jan. 1, 1992, will bring California in line 
with federal standards and prevent the state from losing as much as $86 million 
a year in highway funds after 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said a stricter drunk driving standard should apply to truck drivers 
and commercial boat operators because of the potential danger they pose to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great difference between the skill it takes to drive an automobile 
and carrying 40 tons of steel in a tractor-trailer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation restricting access to motor vehicle records was prompted by the 
discovery that Robert John Bardo, the suspected killer of actress Rebecca 
Schaeffer, obtained her home address from the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), people who wish to 
keep their home address confidential may do so by submitting an alternative 
address, such as a post office box or place of work, which could be released. 
</P>
<P>
The bill had the emotional backing of Schaeffer's parents and actors and 
actresses who have been stalked by unwelcome fans. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian earlier issued an executive order requiring the Department of Motor 
Vehicles to delay the release of personal information for 10 days while 
officials notify the person whose records are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office also announced that Deukmejian: 
</P>
<P>
* Signed a bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda) allowing local law 
enforcement agencies to seize liquor licenses from restaurants, bars and liquor 
stores where illegal activity occurs. * Signed two bills by Assemblyman Bruce 
Bronzan (D-Fresno) designed to improve the testing of pesticide residues in 
food. Supported by segments of the agriculture industry, the legislation will 
require monitoring of processed foods, require farmers to report their use of 
pesticides to the state and spend $1 million to explore alternatives to 
pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed a bill by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) that would have 
required all private and public employers with 25 or more workers to provide 
AIDS education classes. Deukmejian said he believes businesses should be 
responsible for AIDS education for workers only when contracting the disease is 
an "occupational hazard." 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed a bill by Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles) that would have 
required employers to permit workers to use their sick leave to take care of 
ill children. The governor said employers can allow such leave without 
government interference. 
</P>
<P>
* Signed a measure by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) doubling the minimum fine 
from $100 to $200 for drivers of large trucks caught speeding the first time. 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed a bill by Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) that would have made it 
illegal for employers to require employees to speak only English while on the 
job -- unless such a rule can be justified by business necessity. The governor 
said this action already is prohibited under existing state fair employment 
regulations.

'BLACK TAR' HEROIN SUSPECTED CAUSE OF 3 S.F. DRUG DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A potent batch of "black tar" heroin -- a thick, dark, congealed form of the 
drug -- may have caused a spate of overdoses and at least three deaths in San 
Francisco this weekend, a doctor at San Francisco General Hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
The exact cause of the deaths of three unidentified victims is being 
investigated by the coroner's office, Dr. Larry Stinnett said in a telephone 
interview. But he added that "the situations in which most of these incidents 
were reported indicate that the victims were heroin users." 
</P>
<P>
Stinnett said about 50 overdose patients, many coming from the Tenderloin 
district -- a downtown area to which police attribute a high incidence of drug 
use and sales -- had been treated since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Either they were picked up in houses and areas that are known for intravenous 
drug use or friends and relatives called to say that the victims just shot up," 
Stinnett said. "In all of the cases they were found with tracks (multiple scars 
resulting from needle injections) or fresh puncture marks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potent Heroin Possibly From Mexico 
</P>
<P>
The reports of the apparent heroin overdoses began coming into San Francisco 
General last Friday, said Stinnett, who has worked in the hospital's emergency 
room for five years. In the past, on an average day, one case might be 
reported, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The patients all say that it was black tar," Stinnett said. "It appears to be 
the same shipment of high potency heroin. . . . I believe that this shipment is 
from Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
The number of reported overdoses appeared to be tailing off, the physician 
said. Three cases were reported on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In general the "black tar" form of the drug may vary in potency from 40% to 80% 
heroin, authorities said. Stinnett said the batch of heroin responsible for the 
overdoses may be at the 80% grade or higher. 
</P>
<P>
"The patients shoot up, and all have almost immediately realized that they have 
gotten ahold of some potent stuff," Stinnett said. "They quickly lose 
consciousness and their breathing becomes very shallow. In some cases they stop 
breathing altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Medical and law enforcement authorities in Los Angeles said there has not been 
a reported recent rise in heroin related overdoses in the area.

CHINESE STUDENTS RALLY IN U.S. TO DEMAND DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Despite threats from their government, more than 1,000 Chinese students 
attending American universities came here from across the United States on 
Sunday to call for a "free and democratic China" and march in protest in front 
of their embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the hope that one day soon we will see democracy in China," Father 
Robert Drinan, a Roman Catholic priest and former Massachusetts congressman, 
told the rally at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial. The protest was designed as 
a counterdemonstration to the 40th anniversary celebration of Communist rule in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, about 500 Chinese students and sympathizers protested 
peacefully outside the Chinese Consulate with prayers for those killed last 
June in Beijing's Tian An Men Square, freedom songs and a mock trial of Chinese 
Communist leaders staged against the backdrop of a rented Hollywood tank. 
</P>
<P>
A declaration adopted by the rally in Washington demanded revision of the 
Chinese constitution, protection of human rights, free elections and a "free 
market economy." 
</P>
<P>
Then, citing the message of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. from the same steps 
two decades ago, the declaration concluded, "We have a dream . . . of a free 
and democratic China." 
</P>
<P>
At the rally, organized by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and 
Scholars, addresses alternated with rock groups that played songs written to 
commemorate the massacre of Chinese students in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Chinese students wore T-shirts proclaiming their commitment to 
democracy and held banners identifying their schools -- from UCLA and 
Washington State to Michigan and Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was made up mostly of students from mainland China, with a smattering 
of Chinese-Americans. Up to 40,000 mainland Chinese are enrolled in about 200 
American universities. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), who has championed legislation in Congress to 
allow the students to remain beyond their visa deadlines, said that Chinese 
officials have warned students against "activities that could jeopardize their 
future and that of their families" in China. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, they were told that "attendance here could be regarded as a 
counterrevolutionary activity," Gorton said. Such threats are impermissible in 
the United States, he declared. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles rally, organized by the Joint Committee of Chinese Students 
and Scholars in Southern California, young families with babies sat and stood 
in Shatto Place outside the closed consulate, laughing and applauding skits 
commemorating the Chinese army's firing on students last June. A rubber-tired 
movie-prop tank, rented with its driver for $500, set the somber scene. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters placed several dozen carnations on a mock casket and paused in 
silent prayer in memory of the slain students. Waving placards urging "Leave 
Students Alone" and "Abolish One-Party Rule," the crowd shouted "Down with 
communism!" and sang a parody of a People's Republic of China patriotic song, 
substituting words that translated to "There is no new China until there is no 
communism." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly enjoying a mock "court of history," the protesters refused to volunteer 
any defense counsel for three men wearing masks representing China's paramount 
leader, Deng Xiaoping, President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng. They 
laughed as a "jury" sentenced the three to death by burning, hanging and burial 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police closed Shatto Place between 4th and 6th Streets to vehicular 
traffic during the two-hour program of speeches, songs and skits. 
</P>
<P>
No one from the consulate appeared at the rally. 
</P>

Times staff writer Myrna Oliver, in Los Angeles, contributed to this story.

E. GERMANY RIGHT ON REFUGEES, GORBACHEV AIDE SAYS

A senior adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Sunday that East 
Germany made the right decision in letting East German refugees go to the West. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the leadership in East Germany made the correct decision, in the 
interests of the people and of the state," said Valentin M. Falin, who advises 
Gorbachev on German affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of East Germans arrived on special trains in West Germany from Prague 
and Warsaw on Sunday. In an interview with the West German newspaper Die Welt, 
released ahead of publication today, Falin was asked if Moscow is following 
developments in East Germany with concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that there are such phases in the development of all countries -- 
including West Germany. They can certainly cause reflection and also some 
concern," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
Falin said Gorbachev would have a message for the two German states when he 
visits East Berlin next week for celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important time. . . . This time must be used as productively as 
possibly by all states in Europe in order to ensure a better future for Europe 
as a whole," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Gorbachev's oft-repeated theme of the "common European house," 
Falin said East and West should work together to build such a house in which no 
one felt disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
"Every state must have its comfortable accommodation, including East Germany -- 
certainly, a house with open doors and fresh air," he added.

East German leader Erich Honecker, rumored to be suffering from cancer, will 
travel to Switzerland for surgery, a West German newspaper said Sunday in a 
report attributed to Western intelligence services. 
</P>
<P>
The Welt am Sonntag paper said Honecker will travel to Switzerland immediately 
after celebrations Oct. 7 marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the 
German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The newspaper gave no other details 
about the report but attributed it to Western intelligence sources. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that Honecker has cancer was fueled in early September when 
security sources in Bonn said he had undergone an unsuccessful gall bladder 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old leader resumed his duties last week after a five-week absence 
from office, during which he underwent surgery. East German officials rejected 
claims that the operation was not successful and said Honecker was in good 
health.

Archbishop of Canterbury Robert A. K. Runcie, criticized for suggesting that 
Pope John Paul II play a leadership role for Anglicans, declared Sunday that he 
had not meant that the pontiff should administer the affairs of the Church of 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Runcie issued the statement hours after three Protestant clergymen interrupted 
his Sunday sermon by shouting that his four-day visit to the Vatican was "a 
betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
Runcie, leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, is making his first 
official trip to the Vatican as part of a quest to eventually bring the 
churches together. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, he said some people had charged that his suggestion to give 
the Pope some sort of primacy among Christians "subverts the British 
constitution." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the case," Runcie said. "The phrase universal primacy has a 
spiritual meaning. It does not imply political supremacy and does not suggest 
that the Pope should administer the affairs of the Church of England." 
</P>
<P>
The Anglican Church split from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th Century 
over the Pope's refusal to annul King Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of 
Aragon. The Queen of England is considered the temporal head of the Church of 
England. 
</P>
<P>
"When people try to suggest the whole British constitution is being subverted, 
it's just someone trying to make a story or stir things up," the Rev. Canon 
Christopher Hill, secretary for ecumenical affairs to the archbishop, told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'High Treason' 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hill nor the statement said who was doing the criticizing, but 
Protestant minister Ian Paisley delivered a protest to Runcie's spokeswoman 
Saturday accusing the Anglican leader of "high treason." 
</P>
<P>
Paisley, of Northern Ireland, also assailed Runcie for attending a papal Mass 
in Rome on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Paisley is head of the Free Presbyterian Church in Northern Ireland, which is 
vehemently anti-Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Paisley's associates disrupted an Anglican church service attended by 
Vatican officials on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
As Runcie was about to begin his sermon at All Saints Anglican Church, the 
three clergymen jumped up and peeled off their jackets, revealing T-shirts 
emblazoned "Runcie Is a Traitor to Protestant Britain." 
</P>
<P>
Ushers hustled the protesters away and police checked their passports, but no 
arrests were made. Runcie showed no emotion at the interruption. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters identified themselves as the Rev. David Cassells of Glasgow, 
Scotland, the Rev. Brian Green of London and the Rev. David Larner of London, 
all officers of the British Council of Protestant Christian Churches. 
</P>
<P>
Paisley said he did not join the protest because security guards would not have 
allowed him into the church. 
</P>
<P>
Runcie attended an outdoor Mass in St. Peter's Square on Sunday during which 
the Pope beatified 29 people. Beatification is a step toward possible 
sainthood.

POLICE ARREST 1,092 IN WEEKEND SWEEPS; GANG KILLINGS CONTINUE 
</P>

<P>
A Los Angeles police task force made more than 1,000 arrests over the weekend 
in its crusade to cut down on gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
But just hours after Operation Hammer ended its sweeps early Sunday, two young 
men were killed -- suspected victims of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Task force officers patrolled the central and eastern parts of the city and the 
San Fernando Valley between about 6 p.m. and 3:30 a.m. on both weekend nights. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,092 people arrested, 629 were gang members, police said. Saturday 
night yielded 624 arrests, and 345 of the people belonged to gangs. On Friday, 
officers arrested 468 people, 288 of them gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspects were arrested for investigation of misdemeanors, ranging 
from drunk driving to possession of narcotics to curfew violations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, police seized 18 guns, 16 of them owned by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-related violence later erupted in other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson R. Alas, 15, was shot and killed in Hollywood on Sunday morning after he 
exchanged words with several known gang members, Los Angeles Police Detective 
Bill Humphry said. Alas, an admitted street gang member, was dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Another young man, who also associated with known gang members, was killed at 
about the same time in the 25500 block of Marigold Avenue near Harbor City, Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. Tony Rosa said. The victim's name was withheld. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made in either shooting. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight other people were victims of gang-related shootings over the 
weekend, including a 25-year-old man killed in Pacoima just one hour after the 
task force finished its first-night sweep. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was not released, was killed by a bullet from a passing car 
as he sat on a curb in the 10300 block of Amboy Avenue at about 2:45 a.m. 
Saturday, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Al Yarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend sweeps aimed at interrogating and arresting suspected gang members 
began in early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates nicknamed the special operation "The Hammer," 
saying they were designed to make life for gang members miserable. The sweeps 
also attempt to deter crime by increasing police visibility in neighborhoods.

A SLOW RECOVERY; 
</P>
<P>
2 YEARS AFTER QUAKE, WHITTIER FAR FROM END OF REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the second anniversary of the earthquake that violently shook the Southland, 
Whittier officials have doubled to 10 years their estimate of how long it will 
take for their shattered city to fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
Repair of homes and businesses in Whittier -- with $78 million in damage, the 
city hardest hit by the 5.9 temblor on Oct. 1, 1987 -- has been stalled by 
problems with contractors, the lengthy process of obtaining earthquake recovery 
loans and disputes over how the city should be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters, city engineers are seeing the first signs of escalating 
deterioration of the community's aging sewer system, which they attribute to 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10-Year Effort Expected 
</P>
<P>
Last year, civic and business leaders predicted that it would take about five 
years to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
"Building was going rapid-fire right after the earthquake, and then it 
stopped," said City Manager Tom Mauk. "It took time for homeowners to get 
funding and figure out what they wanted to do. That was when I realized this 
was a 10-year process." 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 homes and businesses in the community of 73,000 residents, 20 
miles southeast of Los Angeles, were damaged in the temblor. The quake, the 
largest in Southern California in 16 years, caused $368 million in damage 
throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties and three deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Today, roughly 20% of the damaged buildings in Whittier are still under 
reconstruction. About a dozen vacant lots stand as reminders of what's left to 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials say there have been tremendous strides in reconstruction, 
despite the problems. Others say rebuilding has not gone fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of the powerful temblor are easily spotted, especially in the historic 
Uptown area, where many of the Victorian-style homes were built 60 years ago. 
Scores of quaint houses near the picturesque stretch of Beverly Boulevard are 
in various states of disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the city had to dig up a half-mile of Painter Avenue to replace a 
70-year-old sewer line that split in several places. Assistant City Engineer 
Leon Yehuda said similar breaks are expected to be found in the city's 200 
miles of sewer lines in the future, although at present "it is impossible to 
predict the scope of the damage." 
</P>
<P>
Jumpy residents have called city building inspectors to complain that their 
earthquake-shaken homes now creak, apparently caused by the settling of wooden 
frames and shifting ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes people nervous," said Richard Hubinger, the city's director of 
building and safety. He said he assures the "numerous" callers not to worry, 
that "the house is not going to fall down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outsiders Surprised 
</P>
<P>
People often are surprised to learn the city is still rebuilding, said Larry 
Haendiges, president of the Uptown Merchants Assn. and a Planning Commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy for an outsider to say, 'Well, just fix it. Why is it taking so 
long?' " he said. "It takes time and money. People who are impatient just can't 
survive this." 
</P>
<P>
Marie Moore, who lives with her husband and three children in a historic, 
two-story Uptown home, knows patience all too well. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the family moved back into their still-damaged home. Two separate 
contractors reportedly took Moore's money and walked off the job, bringing work 
on the house to a halt several times in the last two years. The Moores are now 
on their third contractor and hope to see the house, in which several rooms are 
uninhabitable, finished next year. 
</P>
<P>
The house is on stilts, exposing a gaping hole where the cracked foundation 
once stood. Mounds of dirt bury the front yard. Boards cover the front windows. 
</P>
<P>
"Not in my wildest dreams would I think that it would take this long," Moore 
said. "I want to go forward. I just want to put everything behind me and go 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lewis, the city's building rehabilitation manager, said at least 4% of the 
residents who had repairs done on their homes experienced problems with 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
As contractors descended upon the city by the dozens -- some from as far away 
as Alaska -- to seek work repairing thousands of damaged homes, the city tried 
to weed out those who were untrustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Three or four times we would tell people, 'Hey, this guy is no good,' " Lewis 
said. "No matter how much you tell them, some just wouldn't listen. They were 
desperate to get their lives back in shape." 
</P>
<P>
One contractor went through neighborhoods grossly underbidding jobs. When he 
received down payments, he disappeared, Lewis said. Another took on too many 
projects, then could not finish the jobs. One went out of business, others left 
the state. The stories go on and on, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bolin, a researcher from New Mexico State University who is studying the 
lasting effects the quake has had on Whittier, said the pattern surfaces time 
and again. "You get unqualified contractors" who prey on disaster-stricken 
areas around the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And even when residents found reputable contractors, many of them had to wait 
at least six months to obtain federal, state or city loans, Lewis said. As a 
result, in some areas construction had barely started eight months after the 
quake because of "the lengthy bureaucratic process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting for State Aid 
</P>
<P>
Today, a dozen residents still are waiting for funding from the state, Lewis 
said. One out of 10 homeowners who applied for loans were turned down often 
because they already were too much in debt, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are always people who fall through the cracks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Wilson, who owns a house near Beverly Boulevard, is a perfect example. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has been waiting since the quake to receive a loan. Recently, he was 
told he soon will receive state funds to repair his home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a bloody nightmare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burden on Elderly 
</P>
<P>
Some elderly people living in homes they had paid off prior to the earthquake 
had to obtain large loans to repair the damage, Lewis said. In some instances, 
older people had to go back to work or put off retirement just to get money the 
cover their loan payments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the problems, Whittier's residents feel strong allegiance to 
their community, according to studies and city leaders. But fast-paced change, 
much of it brought on by reconstruction, is having an impact on how people view 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer Sleepy 
</P>
<P>
"This is what they used to characterize as a sleepy, quaint, historical 
village," said Joe Holiday, the president of the Uptown Homeowners' Assn. "Now 
it's changing to a more modern commuter, typical Southern California-type 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the temblor, developers began approaching owners of ravaged homes 
in areas zoned for high-density construction, urging them to sell rather than 
take on the tiresome and costly repair process. 
</P>
<P>
Some sold and, quickly, apartment complexes started to spring up. 
</P>
<P>
Soon community activists discovered that the city was allowing developers to 
build apartments in violation of the city's General Plan, a long-range 
blueprint calling for single-family homes in much of the quake-stricken area. 
The residents joined together and demanded that the building be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"The residential areas were up for grabs," said Helen Rahder, a researcher for 
the Whittier Conservancy, a powerful citizens' group formed after the 
earthquake. "We were not going to sit by and let those homes be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, city officials listened and adopted a plan to protect historical 
property and the city's small-town atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"Growth is never achieved without controversy," said Manny Ocampo, assistant 
city manager. "We're making the best out of a tragic situation. It just takes 
time."

TURF BATTLE OVER SPORTS PHYSICALS; 
</P>
<P>
DOCTORS OPPOSE CHIROPRACTORS ON CHECKUPS FOR SCHOOL ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, Times Education Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In his nine years as a chiropractor, Tim Ursich has performed physical 
examinations on aspiring athletes, deciding whether the youths are fit to 
participate in sports at such high schools as Rolling Hills on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, Bishop Montgomery in Torrance and Redondo Union in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But if any of his young patients want to go out for sports at such schools as 
Banning, Carson or Gardena High -- all part of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District -- district regulations dictate they must be examined by a licensed 
physician and surgeon: a medical doctor or an osteopath. 
</P>
<P>
Ursich and some of his colleagues, under the aegis of the increasingly active 
California Chiropractic Assn., are trying to get the regulation changed to 
allow chiropractors and other licensed health care practitioners to perform the 
physicals. 
</P>
<P>
Their controversial campaign to change the regulation, scheduled for a vote 
today by a divided school board, has drawn vociferous opposition from the Los 
Angeles County Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be Step Backward' 
</P>
<P>
"We have been trying for years to progressively improve the medical care of the 
school athlete," said Dr. Jerome (Jerry) Bornstein, an Encino orthopedist who 
has been a team physician since 1961 and a member of the medical association's 
sports medicine committee. 
</P>
<P>
"This would be a step backward, not forward," Bernstein said. "I have respect 
for what chiropractors are trained to do in the healing arts, but I think they 
are overstepping (their qualifications) here." 
</P>
<P>
The debate in Los Angeles, where about 20,000 students a year are required to 
take sports screening physical exams, is being watched throughout California's 
health care community. It comes at a time when chiropractors have been seeking 
-- and getting -- wider acceptance, in part through favorable court decisions 
and aggressive lobbying and public relations. Marking the debate, which has 
escalated rapidly since the issue was heard in the Board of Education's 
Personnel and Schools Committee in August, is a tangle of medical and legal 
arguments fraught, both sides say, with political overtones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Losing Some of the Pie' 
</P>
<P>
"The MDs are starting to worry about the competition, that they're losing some 
of the pie," said Paul Lehman, director of public affairs for the chiropractic 
association. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Charles McElwee, president of the county medical association and an 
orthopedic surgeon in Covina, said turf is not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scope of training," McElwee said. "They are not physicians and they 
shouldn't be practicing medicine. If (a patient) wants a true history and 
physical exam, they cannot get it from a chiropractor." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Hale, a pediatrician who is director of student health services for the 
district, said the school board requires a complete physical examination, 
including hearing, vision, heart, lungs and other internal organs and an 
evaluation of the musculoskeletal system, plus a medical history, before a 
youngster is allowed to participate in athletics. In most instances, the family 
pays the cost of the exam. If a child's family can't afford it, either one of 
the district's 40 staff physicians or private doctors provide the service for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
Board Member Rita Walters has been outspoken in her opposition to changing the 
regulations to include chiropractors, nurse practitioners and others. To fully 
protect the district from liability and to provide the best screening and care 
for its students, the exams ought to be done by physicians, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate, but for some of these families, this (sports physical) may 
be the only time their teen-age children encounter a physician. I think they 
ought to see a fully licensed medical doctor," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jerilynn Kaibel, a chiropractor with practices in San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties and a member of the Beaumont Unified School District Board 
of Education, said chiropractors can do just as good an exam as medical 
doctors. She is convinced that chiropractors are well qualified to do physicals 
for Los Angeles, even though the exam is more thorough than that required in 
many other districts. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A.'s exam is very comprehensive, and that's good," Kaibel said, "but it's 
nothing outside the scope of chiropractic." 
</P>
<P>
There is wide disagreement about what chiropractors, whose training and 
practice centers on the musculoskeletal system, are trained and licensed to do. 
</P>
<P>
Chiropractors want the district to follow the lead of the California 
Interscholastic Federation, the private association which oversees school 
athletic competitions throughout the state. The CIF allows the job of physical 
exams to be done by any "medical practitioner." Several school districts in 
California, including several in Los Angeles and Orange counties, have 
patterned their own regulations after the CIF. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Districts' Policies Cited 
</P>
<P>
"School districts all over the state have decided there is no problem (with 
allowing chiropractors to do sports physicals). So why," said Ursich, "is that 
different in Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Byrnes, the CIF's state commissioner of athletics, cautioned that the 
organization's regulations are not meant to preempt local districts' judgment 
in the matter of who should do the exams. 
</P>
<P>
"We leave it to the local school districts to determine who is qualified . . . 
or what constitutes a proper exam," Byrnes said, noting the federation a couple 
of years ago considered, then rejected, a proposal to change its regulations to 
accept exams only from licensed physicians and surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides cite state law and court cases to bolster their arguments and both 
have threatened to sue if they don't like the school board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to school board President Jackie Goldberg, who has sought to have 
chiropractors allowed, attorney Michael J. Schroeder argued that "chiropractors 
always have been legally authorized to diagnose all conditions or diseases of 
the human body" and said there "is little question that the position that the 
district has taken is contrary to law." 
</P>
<P>
The district's legal advisers said some of the legal issues, including scope of 
practice questions in a recent Sacramento court case on appeal, have yet to be 
fully resolved. Still, district staff attorney Ron Apperson said he believes 
"there is sufficient basis to allow the board to make a decision on the choice 
before them" -- whether to keep its current policy or change it to more closely 
conform with the CIF regulations.

FREEWAY FEARED AS SCAR ON HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
FOES MARCH ALONG CONTESTED ROUTE IN SOUTH PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within earshot of where state transportation officials want eight lanes of Long 
Beach Freeway traffic to wind through South Pasadena, preservationists and city 
officials on Sunday hoisted a white flag with blue letters bearing the message: 
"South Pasadena: One of America's Most Endangered Places." 
</P>
<P>
While hundreds of onlookers sang along as the South Pasadena High School band 
played the national anthem, representatives of the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation presented the flag to symbolize the group's recent designation of 
the San Gabriel Valley city as one of 11 endangered historic places nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Any benefits derived by this (freeway) link cannot outweigh the devastation," 
Wayne Ratkovich, a board member of the Washington-based preservation group, 
told the rally. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the land of the free, not of the freeway," added William Delvac of the 
California Preservation Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) told the cheering crowd: "We are going to 
stop this freeway." 
</P>
<P>
In combination with a pre-rally march along the proposed freeway route and a 
tour of architecturally significant houses that would be lost to the project, 
Sunday's rally, organizers said, represented a new high water mark in the 
decades-long battle over a 6.2-mile gap in the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people marched the proposed route, the so-called Meridian Variation, 
advocated by Caltrans officials as the way to link the Long Beach Freeway with 
the San Bernardino, Pasadena and Foothill freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation planners consider the gap in the Long Beach Freeway as the last 
link in the Los Angeles freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
A white Saab convertible carrying former and current South Pasadena officials 
and a mariachi band from El Sereno, surrounded by pom-pom waving cheerleaders 
of El Sereno Junior High School, embodied the spirit of the 2-mile march. The 
parade of boys on bikes, babies in strollers and people carrying placards went 
from the working-class streets of Los Angeles' El Sereno neighborhood into more 
affluent South Pasadena, home to 24,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Highway Administration officials in recent months have been studying an 
environmental report on the Meridian Variation. Critics say completion of the 
project could destroy 7,000 trees and 1,500 houses, and force the relocation of 
6,000 people in Pasadena, South Pasadena, and El Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
Among the houses affected would be 52 historic Craftsman and 
Mediterranean-revival houses, including the 1887 Queen Anne-style house, 
Wynyate, home of South Pasadena's first mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Five hundred people paid $7 each to tour 10 of the houses in Pasadena and South 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
At one, a home designed by Myron Hunt and Elmer Grey, who also planned the Rose 
Bowl and the Beverly Hills Hotel, people sighed over the prospects that the 
1905 structure would be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a crime," said Sharon Thompson of Glassell Park. "Surely, there 
must be a better way." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have proposed mass transit, including light-rail cars, or 
traffic-light synchronization as options to the freeway, which planners say 
would cost $450 million, but critics claim would require more than twice that. 
</P>
<P>
A report on the reaction by federal officials to the state's suggested route 
has been expected for weeks and, according to a spokesman, Caltrans hopes to 
submit it for review to the state Transportation Commission soon. 
</P>
<P>
But freeway opponents have been lobbying heavily, including meetings last 
Wednesday with the chief legal counsel of the Federal Highway Administration 
who, opponents say, they persuaded to come from Washington for a first-hand 
look. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, campaigns to forestall the project are being waged by a North 
Hollywood public relations firm hired by South Pasadena and the city's San 
Francisco lawyer, Antonio Cosby-Rossmann, who has been prominent in 
environmental battles -- including his recent work in behalf of Inyo County and 
its fight with the city of Los Angeles over water rights. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the only legal action over the freeway issue came in 1973, when a 
federal court injunction required an environmental impact report.

MOUNTAIN LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Wildlife Protection Initiative would indeed prohibit trophy hunting of the 
California mountain lion, but would not restrict hunting of any other species. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the initiative would protect extensive areas of habitat for a wide 
variety of wildlife, specifically including deer. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic decline in the numbers of deer in California is largely a 
reflection of habitat loss. This decline can only be stopped if enough deer 
habitat is acquired to protect remaining deer (and mountain lion) populations. 
</P>
<P>
The hunting community should support the initiative, since it offers the only 
real hope that deer habitat will be preserved for generations to come in both 
Northern and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers should also support the initiative, since fishing streams throughout 
the state would also be improved.

TAKING AIM AT HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The failure of the Legislature to approve major legislation to remedy the 
health-care crisis will now almost certainly force the issue on the ballot of 
November, 1990, with the likelihood that at least two measures will be before 
the voters. 
</P>
<P>
California's crisis, like the nation's crisis, is measured in a variety of 
ways. There are 5.2 million Californians without any form of health insurance. 
Health-care inflation is overwhelming efforts to provide effective, affordable 
insurance. Cost containment remains elusive. Some basic services, including 
trauma centers, are deteriorating. Prenatal care, perhaps the single most 
cost-effective program, is not reaching all pregnant women, despite some 
improvements. Thousands of children are unable to receive basic medical and 
dental services. Many hospitals are in critical and declining financial 
condition because of the heavy burden of uncompensated care. The whole Medi-Cal 
system to serve low-income persons is handicapped by inadequate compensation 
for doctors and dentists and hospitals, which reduces the availability of care. 
</P>
<P>
At the last session of the Legislature, two basic approaches were considered. 
One would have mandated that employers provide health insurance, a program that 
would have extended protection to about half of the uninsured. The other would 
have assured universal health insurance by a combination of state-directed 
programs. The best the Legislature could do was adopt a tax credit for 
businesses providing health care -- to begin in 1992. In the wake of those 
failures, the two central concepts are being translated into rival initiatives 
for the 1990 general election. 
</P>
<P>
The timetable for qualifying an initiative for next year requires formal filing 
by the end of October. Intense negotiations are now under way. There appears 
little likelihood of a broad-based agreement on a single ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
As matters stand now, the California Medical Assn. is leading efforts to draft 
an initiative based largely on mandating that employers provide health 
insurance. It reflects the proposals of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown in AB 
350. It would envision some state subsidy to make the insurance more 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
The other leading provider organization, the California Assn. of Hospitals and 
Health Systems, is actively engaged with the CMA in drafting the mandated 
insurance initiative. Its initial collaboration with Health Access of 
California, a broad-based coalition seeking a more extensive solution, appears 
to have ended in disagreements over creating a new and powerful state agency to 
control health-care finance. 
</P>
<P>
Health Access has been using as its model AB 328 by Assemblyman Burt Margolin 
(D-Los Angeles), which would assure health coverage for everyone in the state. 
It would be funded by a combination of existing federal and state revenues, 
payroll taxes, premiums and tobacco tax monies. A Health Plan Commission or 
elected state commissioner, a sort of "California Surgeon General," would be 
created to administer the program. Minimum standards for health insurance would 
be set and premiums controlled. Rates paid providers for specific procedures 
and services would also be controlled. Citizens would continue to have options 
regarding the kind of coverage they purchased, including fee for service, 
preferred provider and health maintenance organization plans. The access 
initiative also would step into the most pressing problem of seniors, to 
provide long-term nursing-home care insurance, not now a benefit of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant unfinished business for those drafting the initiatives is 
cost containment. There is no question that any extension of health insurance 
without provision to contain the costs will invite a fresh surge of the already 
excessive medical inflation. 
</P>
<P>
There is another caution that the drafters should observe. Initiatives are a 
poor substitute for legislation because of their rigidity, the difficulty of 
adapting them as times change. That risk can be minimized by providing for 
amendment by a simple majority of the Legislature.

CURBING GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just read Frank del Olmos' column "Orange County Can Step In to Diminish 
Gang Violence" (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 25). While the advice was sound, there is 
more to it than that. The successes in curbing gang violence in East Los 
Angeles weren't due to the efforts of one group, and it didn't come about in a 
period of four or five years with the creation of the Community Youth Gang 
Services Project. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to curb gang violence in East Los Angeles go back to the mid-1970s, 
when the California Youth Authority (CYA) implemented the Gang Violence 
Reduction Project (GVRP) in East Los Angeles in November of 1976. And before 
the state stepped in, a group of mothers who had seen their sons killed decided 
they were going to prevent their remaining children from being killed. And the 
Catholic Church also became involved in these mothers' quests. 
</P>
<P>
GVRP was the successful program that provided city and county officials with a 
model to create the Community Youth Gang Services Project. Both involve 
interagency cooperation, and success has come from the involvement of the 
community in both efforts. The involvement of parents, the business community, 
the churches, as well as government, has been an integral part of the success 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Recent increases in gang-related deaths can be attributed to the overflow from 
the intensity of the gang wars in South-Central Los Angeles. In spite of this 
increased violence, the East Los Angeles community is fighting desperately to 
hold the line. Some of the violence is still leaching through the defenses. 
This may have something to do with the fact that these defenses have been 
weakened somewhat when the consultants from the Youth Gang Services Project 
were moved to South-Central to work their magic in that community. 
</P>
<P>
A coalescence has been occurring in East Los Angeles during this decade that 
has gone virtually undetected. Quietly, this community has been looking into 
itself for answers to some of its problems. If Orange County, or any other 
community, is going to be able to fight back and nip the gang violence problems 
in the bud . . . it must be a concentrated community effort that involves 
government, schools, churches, businesses and families.

BUSH CROWD HAS A PLAN FOR BROAD TAX RETREAT; 
</P>
<P>
BITE WILL BE ON MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE L. FISHER, Fisher is research director of Citizens for Tax Justice 
based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration's current drive to cut the tax on capital gains is part 
of a larger economic policy agenda that, if enacted, will fundamentally change 
the nation's tax system while swelling the federal budget deficit -- all at the 
expense of middle- and lower-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has persuaded the House (and now awaits a Senate vote) to 
cut the capital-gains tax, at a net cost of $21 billion over 10 years. Bush 
also wants "incentives" for savings, such as expanded Individual Retirement 
Accounts (IRAs), arguing, against a mountain of contrary evidence, that this 
will stimulate personal savings. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has 
proposed a cornucopia of costly corporate tax breaks, including a deduction for 
stock dividends that would cost $40 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
To deal with the budget-busting impact of these changes, the President's team 
is likely to seek enactment of a regressive national sales tax similar to the 
value-added taxes assessed in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some key House and Senate members are receptive to these ideas. 
The Democratic congressional leadership had already endorsed expanding tax 
breaks for IRAs. And Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen has said 
that "there'd be a good chance" for enacting a national sales tax if Bush gave 
the plan his full support. 
</P>
<P>
These proposals will all swell the deficit. They will all contribute to a 
further shift of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy. None of them will 
increase savings or reduce the cost of capital. 
</P>
<P>
These proposals are on the table because the 1986 Tax Reform Act has been an 
economic success but a political failure. Although tax sheltering is down and 
both savings and investment are up since the tax bill was enacted, the public 
has never been convinced that the Reagan Administration and Congress did the 
right thing three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Public skepticism has left tax reform vulnerable to special-interest lobbyists 
who want pre-1986 tax breaks restored in the name of helping business capital 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of capital formation point with alarm to our high real-interest rates 
and our low national-savings rate. Capital costs in the United States are 
indeed higher than in Japan and West Germany. But the primary cause is 
Washington's excessive borrowing -- to cover the debt run up by the supply-side 
tax cuts of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Commerce Department data show that the personal savings rate is now 
on an upswing, from a low of 2.3% of GNP in 1987 to 4.0% for the first two 
quarters of 1989. This resurgence in personal savings has occurred despite the 
limitations on IRA tax deductions enacted in 1986, whereby they were restricted 
to families that make less than $50,000 or have no other private retirement 
plan. Congress took the heat on IRAs in the 1986 tax reform act because it saw 
that unrestricted IRAs were merely a tool used by high-income people to shift 
existing savings into tax-advantaged accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since the 1986 reforms eliminated many of the costliest tax breaks 
for business, corporate profitability has grown. Real capital spending has 
grown at an annual rate of 6.1% since 1986, compared to an anemic 2.1% over the 
previous five years. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that tax reform has worked and worked well but that the federal 
deficit continues to hang like a millstone around the economy's neck. The Bush 
agenda would reprise the early Reagan Administration program, which 
then-President Ronald Reagan himself abandoned in 1986, and fund it with a 
national sales tax, which will take a larger share of the disposable incomes of 
lower-income people than of higher-income people. 
</P>
<P>
Studies by the Congressional Budget Office show that between 1977 and 1988, the 
richest 1% of Americans enjoyed a 74% jump in real after-tax incomes, while 
real incomes for low- and middle-income families stagnated or declined. 
</P>
<P>
And the lesson of the early Reagan years is that if you give the rich more 
money, they don't save it -- they spend it. Between 1983 and 1986, for example, 
U.S. sales of Jaguars went up 55%, Mercedes, 35%; Porsches, 40%, and BMWs, 63%, 
while sales of U.S.-made cars grew by only 21%. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush agenda would swell the deficit and then raise taxes on working people, 
all in the name of helping business. The fact that business is doing just fine 
now goes unnoticed. The fact that the deficit impedes business capital 
formation is ignored. It's time for Congress to come to its senses and reject 
the whole Bush agenda on this issue and get to work on our largest national 
problem: the federal budget deficit.

MIKE DOWNEY: THEY ARE 4-0 AND READY TO GO . . .

<TEXT>
<P>
All right, you lovers of men in horned helmets, and we don't mean the Vikings, 
now you can go ahead and say those two crazy little words that you have been 
dying to say. 
</P>
<P>
"Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
It's OK now to dream big. The Rams have demonstrated that they can beat 
anybody, anyplace -- even the 49ers at San Francisco. They didn't get snuffed 
out at Candlestick. They came, they played, they conquered Sunday, 13-12, 
showing they can overcome any odds but the over-under. 
</P>
<P>
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire, what has gotten into these Rams? Little 
by little, these young goats have turned into one really tough professional 
football organization, one that trades away Eric Dickerson and gets better. 
</P>
<P>
(For those of us who approved of that deal, excuse us while we gloat.) 
</P>
<P>
These people are primed to win their first Super Bowl, believe me. No, don't 
believe me -- believe them. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams believe in themselves. They believe that they are going to win even 
when they are losing in the final minute and they are playing on their 
opponents' field and their opponents happen to be the 1989 Super Bowl supermen, 
the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of going belly-up never seemed to enter the Rams' minds. Jim 
Everett just popped a couple of passes to Pete Holohan, then stood back and let 
Holohan hold the ball in the middle of Candlestick Park's baseball diamond for 
Mike (I Hit Better Than Carney) Lansford, who kicked it through the uprights to 
win the game, which is a neat little habit of his. 
</P>
<P>
These guys have become a tough, tough bunch, these Los Angeles Rambos. They 
looked Joe Montana in the eye Sunday and refused him passage into their end 
zone. Not one touchdown did the Rambos yield. They knocked Montana on his 
Butte. 
</P>
<P>
Beating Kansas City, Indianapolis and Green Bay, that was one thing, but 
beating Montana, Jerry Rice, Roger Craig and that crowd without giving up a 
touchdown, man, that takes some doing. Kevin Greene and the rest of the Rambo 
defense never gave an inch. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing delays the Rams these days -- not even the airlines. When their flight 
to San Francisco got stuck on the ground Saturday, the Rams simply got off, 
lined up on the Tarmac and ran plays right there in the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Everett took a rubber ball he usually uses for strengthening his grip and made 
believe it was a football as the guys scrimmaged on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, Henry, you go down by the United 747, then cut left behind that baggage 
cart. Willie, zigzag past the Delta DC-10 and circle around behind the 
stewardess. On two!" 
</P>
<P>
Preseason speculation led us to believe the Rams would be serious Super Bowl 
contenders this season, but you never know about that stuff. With the Rams in 
particular, you never know if a running back is going to be a holdout or if 
some other important player is going to be wasting away in Cocaineville. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, everybody in the National Football Conference believed this was going 
to be their year. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco had Montana back. Philadelphia had the new, improved Montana, 
Randall Cunningham. Chicago was its usual tough self and Minnesota thought 
itself tougher than Chicago. Washington and New York demanded their customary 
respect, Dallas, Green Bay and Atlanta had good rookies, Phoenix felt frisky 
and New Orleans knew this was finally the year that the Superdome on Super Bowl 
Sunday would not be a neutral field. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, well, they were better, sure. But this was still the team San 
Francisco had beaten as recently as 1987 by the gruesome little score of 48-0. 
Could the Rams have improved that much in two seasons? 
</P>
<P>
Sure looks that way. 
</P>
<P>
The Rambos have never been bad under John Robinson. They ordinarily have been 
winners and almost always competitive. Yet, come playoff time, nobody ever 
really believed, except Georgia Frontiere and those employed by her, that they 
could go the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Georgia's bulldogs look lean and hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Things are definitely on the upswing in Anaheim. The offense has the E Ride of 
Everett to Ellard. Greg Bell is more dependable than that guy with the tinted 
goggles in Indianapolis. The offensive line for the Rams, well, these goats can 
butt. This Tom Newberry, for example, has become a pro's pro. He clears holes 
sportswriters could run through. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, not so very long ago, when the Ram offense amounted to three 
clouds of dust and Dale Hatcher. Well, the Rams don't have to get 150 yards 
rushing out of their running back to win anymore. Thanks for the memories, 
Dickerson and Charlie White, but now we've got a guy who can pass. 
</P>
<P>
On the outskirts of Disneyland, the Super Bowl no longer feels like 
Fantasyland. It's more like Tomorrowland.

RAMS PICK UP WHERE 49ERS LEAVE OFF, 13-12; 
</P>
<P>
LAST L.A. DRIVE HAS KICK TO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The game plan was circa 1985, a slow-bleed, low-ball strategy that keeps you 
kicking in the end. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams watched another team sack Joe Montana eight times last week and lose 
by 10 points. So they caged their Eagle defense, called off the blitz, dusted 
off their zone and dropped their gloves. The Rams put the highlight reel 
material on hold and allowed Montana and the San Francisco 49ers to take them 
apart in little pieces, never allowing the big chunks. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Rams' answer to mad-dogging defenses and runaway scores. They stayed 
back, hit hard, waited for a break and hoped kicker Mike Lansford would be 
there in the end. 
</P>
<P>
He was. Lansford, battling a stiff head wind and, gulp, the curse of not having 
missed a game-winning kick since high school, sneaked a 26-yard field goal just 
inside the right upright to give the Rams a 13-12 victory over the 49ers before 
64,250, the largest crowd ever to watch football at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three minutes, the Rams moved mountains. They stole a game from the 
world champions and bee-lined toward the airport. 
</P>
<P>
It started with Kevin Greene pouncing on Tom Rathman's fumble with 2:59 left, 
just as the 49ers seemed ready to deliver the death blow. Rathman, who didn't 
fumble all last year, left the ball on the Ram 19-yard line. It sat there like 
a gift from the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
In the 72-yard drive that ensued, quarterback Jim Everett stole a page from 
Montana, the reigning king of story-makers. Everett remembered his critics 
along the way, the ones who remind him daily of his place in history in 
relationship to Montana's. 
</P>
<P>
Everett muffed two last-minute chances for victories last season with 
interceptions in the other team's end zone, whereas Montana seemed to do OK on 
his march in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"This was big-time," Everett said of Sunday's game-winning drive. "A lot of 
people wrote last year that we couldn't win the big game in the end. Not just 
me, but the team. And we won in a fashion that the 49ers usually win." 
</P>
<P>
After Rathman's fumble, Everett worked quickly, hitting Flipper Anderson for 19 
yards and a first down to the Rams' 44 at the two-minute warning. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was Everett to tight end Pete Holohan for 31 yards to the 49ers' 25 
with 1:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
With the gusting winds, the Rams wanted to move closer for Lansford, so instead 
of sitting on the ball on third down at the 27, Everett dumped the ball to 
Holohan, who found a dead spot in the secondary and plodded his way to the 11 
with 22 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford dipped a finger in his mouth and checked the wind. It was blowing left 
to right. He asked the offense to set the ball up on the left hash mark. 
</P>
<P>
You think a field goal isn't a science? Holohan, the drive's hero and 
Lansford's holder, ordered up a Sunday special from snapper Mike McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
"McDonald can give you the laces away, so I don't have to spin it," Holohan 
said. "He can do it almost 100% of the time. It's almost uncanny." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald shot the ball back and Holohan spotted it. Lansford's kick tried to 
dodge the right upright. 
</P>
<P>
"It was going right," Holohan said. "It was as close as it looked." 
</P>
<P>
Lansford missed a game-winning kick once. He was a sophomore at Alhambra High 
School and it's still a running joke between Lansford and then-holder Mike 
Hull. Lansford claims Hull gave him a bad spot back in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Now 31, Lansford continues to dodge a kicker's most frightening bullet -- the 
game-winning missed. He has made every clutch kick in his career. It began with 
a game-winner in 1983 against New Orleans to send the Rams to the playoffs and 
continued Sunday against the 49ers, in a win so big as to bring owner Georgia 
Frontiere into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone asks me to rate my kicks," Lansford said. "I think they're all tied 
for first." 
</P>
<P>
Piece of cake, right? 
</P>
<P>
"People always ask me if it gets any easier," he said. "It doesn't. I'll be 
bald at 40 and have ulcers, but I'll enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Lansford has had a lot on his mind lately. He's still waiting for the Rams to 
renegotiate his contract, and only came to camp at this year's salary of 
$195,000 on that condition. 
</P>
<P>
He can only hope Sunday's kick speeds up negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford at least left management in fine spirits with his kick, which lifted 
the Rams into sole possession of first place in the NFC West, a spot seemingly 
owned by the 49ers for much of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams did it the old-fashioned way. The trend in the league these days is 
gambling defenses and deep passes. You hope you win, 41-38. The Rams fell into 
the same trap in recent weeks, allowing defenses nearly 400 yards per game in 
three victories. 
</P>
<P>
But after Montana dissected Buddy Ryan's 46 defense last week in a 
five-touchdown performance against Philadelphia, the Rams decided it might be 
better to re-invent the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Getting into a shootout with Montana, they reasoned, was not a sound theory. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of film in the last eight years to prove that's not 
necessarily the best way to play that team," defensive coordinator Fritz 
Shurmur said. "You don't fool Joe much. You just want to get him off rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams did it with a soft zone defense. They kept the 49er receivers in front 
of them all day and made them earn every point. Montana finished with 227 yards 
passing but and had only four field goals to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite an accomplishment holding them to no touchdowns," Rams coach John 
Robinson said. "It's been a long time since that's happened." 
</P>
<P>
All-pro receiver Jerry Rice was held without a reception after the first 
quarter, thanks in part to the deep coverage by corner LeRoy Irvin, returning 
from a 30-day substance-abuse suspension. 
</P>
<P>
How hard was it? 
</P>
<P>
On their first drive of the third quarter, the 49ers, trailing, 10-9, used 12 
plays and consumed 8:22 on a drive that ended with nothing after Mike Cofer's 
41-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left. 
</P>
<P>
After three quarters of scratching and scraping, the 49ers finally took the 
lead, 12-10, on a 17-yard Cofer goal with 8:53 left. But even that one took 14 
plays and 7:35. 
</P>
<P>
Keep the bleeding to a minimum, Shurmur ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson felt the field goal was tainted anyhow, convinced his team's preceding 
drive was stopped short when the referees blew a call on 49er nose tackle 
Michael Carter, who appeared to jump off-sides on a crucial third-and-one 
situation for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams would get their break, however, when Rathman fumbled deep in Ram 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I should take the blame for the loss because I did fumble," Rathman 
said. "I had set a goal for myself to not fumble all year and here that goal is 
gone already in the fourth game. I had gone all last year without fumbling. 
Somebody swatted it out when I was getting up to the hole. I guess I just 
didn't have it put away." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were playing for one or two key 49er mistakes all along. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco made its first on defense in the second quarter when Everett and 
Flipper Anderson exploited a Ronnie Lott-less secondary and connected on a 
65-yard scoring pass play. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers offense would take longer to break. Finally, however, Rathman 
obliged, and Greene moved in for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
"When they were driving on us, we were screaming, 'Somebody make the play, 
somebody make the play!' " Greene said. "They were in our area but we were not 
conceding anything. I just saw the ball and fell on it. I don't know what 
happened. It was a great game. We needed this game. And now we're flying." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell finished with 33 yards in 14 carries. . . . Jim Everett completed 16 
of 25 passes for 250 yards. . . . The Rams held Jerry Rice to two receptions 
for 36 yards. . . . Linebacker Frank Stams suffered a bruised left thigh in the 
second half and did not return.

DODGERS' HERSHISER WINS, BUT BARELY LOSES ERA TITLE

Fred Claire peered over the tops of umbrellas above the handful of fans. He 
looked down to the tiny rivers running behind home plate, the pond in right 
field, and groundskeepers wearing hip boots. He looked down at a Dodger team 
that was so wet, bats were slipping out of their hands and balls sliding out of 
their gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Then, quite possibly for the first time since April 3, he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly is different from our last game of last season," the Dodger 
vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
After defeating the Atlanta Braves, 3-1 in 12 innings in the first game of a 
scheduled doubleheader Sunday, the Dodgers saw their season end in a manner 
nearly as strange as last year's world championship. Even though the rain had 
stopped midway through the first game, immediately afterward crew chief Bob 
Engel canceled the second game. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who finished the season with a four-game winning streak and a 
77-83 record, weren't complaining. At least they will be known for something, 
as their 160 games are the fewest by a Dodger team during a non-strike year 
since baseball went to an 162-game schedule in 1962. Their losing record is not 
as original -- it is their third in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had already celebrated the end of the season and their fourth-place 
finish once, early Sunday afternoon, when it appeared that rain would wipe out 
the entire meaningless weekend series. 
</P>
<P>
And then the worst happened. The rain stopped. And two 2 hours 23 minutes after 
the scheduled start, in front of 4,840 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, what 
became the Dodgers' final game finally began. 
</P>
<P>
It ended more than three hours later, after Mike Davis drew a walk and 
pinch-runner Dave Anderson scored from first when pitcher Jay Aldrich threw a 
Jose Vizcaino bunt into the Braves bullpen. Vizcaino scored from third on an 
fly ball by John Shelby to seal a .500 season for starter Orel Hershiser, who 
threw 161 pitches in giving up one earned run in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hershiser's first win since Aug. 8. He finished 15-15 with a 2.31 ERA. 
He barely lost the ERA crown to San Francisco's Scott Garrelts, who had a 2.28 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hershiser addressed the team's needs for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Dodgers need speed, not merely in an everyday center fielder, but 
in a fifth outfielder/pinch runner. He said they need better chemistry. And he 
said the Dodgers need to re-sign Rick Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a large advocate of signing Dempsey," said Hershiser of the 40-year-old 
catcher, whose contract expires this winter. "He's been fantastic for this 
pitching staff." 
</P>
<P>
But Hershiser said the Dodgers will need some new players -- two in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously need to increase our team speed and, while everybody will point 
to center field as the position, I don't think it can be done in one position," 
he said. "We also need a guy who can come off the bench and steal a base for us 
right away. A guy who could pinch-run for a Jeff Hamilton or Mike Scioscia or 
Mike Marshall, and then maybe score from second base to tie or win the game. 
That guy could have affected 10-15 games this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our new guys this year were great guys, and played great, but they just didn't 
come in here and make this team mix together," he said, citing Willie Randolph 
and Eddie Murray. "It was like oil and water in here. We need some other 
ingredients, something to pull us together."

THEY'RE RED HOT: KGB IN BIG ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Move over, Boris Yeltsin. Drop your fishing reel, Eduard Shevardnadze. And, 
Mikhail Gorbachev, get ready to share the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
In an odyssey that represents more than just the geographic distance between 
Disneyland and the Soviet intelligence's neo-classic headquarters in Moscow's 
Dzerzhinsky Square, the highest-ranking Soviet KGB officials ever to publicly 
visit the United States took Southern California by storm last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shopping in the Malls 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Disneyland. And the circus. And Chinatown. And Marina del Rey. 
And, probably most of all, Southern California's shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Fjodor Sherbak and Valentin Zvezdenkov, two generals who both rose to the 
highest echelons of the KGB over a half-century in one the world's most 
legendary intelligence services, seemed to rather like it all. In turn, for all 
the notorious cunning of the Committee for State Security, or the KGB, the 
generals also charmed everyone they encountered. 
</P>
<P>
Asked his impressions of the United States during his first visit, Zvezdenkov, 
who looks a bit like a rugged Russian version of John Wayne, told of his 
trouble with American showers. The tap at the Holiday Inn in Santa Monica was a 
single unit for hot and cold; Zvezdenkov had trouble figuring it out. When he 
got in, the water was ice cold. He soaped up and tried to turn the circular 
control to warm. Instead, the shower turned scalding. He hopped out of the 
shower and rinsed off from the sink. 
</P>
<P>
"In my country," he explained earnestly, "we have separate taps for hot and 
cold." 
</P>
<P>
Then his blue eyes twinkled. 
</P>
<P>
And when his KGB colleague's bag was lost somewhere between Moscow and New 
York, Zvezdenkov considered himself lucky -- until he was told that airlines 
were supposed to pay up to $500 if a bag is not traced within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"My bag went missing, too," he told his American sponsor with great 
seriousness. "And it was bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Then his eyes twinkled again. 
</P>
<P>
By week's end, Zvezdenkov's humor had become such a fixture that the former CIA 
officials and American terrorism experts whom he met at a conference at RAND 
Corp. had nicknamed him "the jolly green general." 
</P>
<P>
Not that any of the U. S. participants were naive about the generals' past 
activities. Zvezdenkov was involved in Soviet counterintelligence for almost 40 
years and, for the eight years until his recent retirement as a major general, 
he was head of the KGB's counterterrorism section. Until a few months ago, Lt. 
Gen. Sherbak was KGB deputy director, overseeing the internal security 
directorate in charge of the gulags and the prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in the KGB," said an American delegate to the conference on international 
terrorism, "always in the KGB." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the two men were more than reluctant to discuss their pasts. Zvezdenkov 
initially made a game of dodging questions. "Do you want the official version 
or the real story?" he responded to one query. "In one version, I was born in 
1934. In the other, I am almost 69." 
</P>
<P>
Over dinner in Marina del Rey, one American teasingly threatened that all the 
Americans at the table would bore him with their life stories if Zvezdenkov did 
not at least provide an outline of his past. "Don't bother," he replied. "We 
already have them all in our files." And he beamed that incorrigible smile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moments of Candor 
</P>
<P>
But, as the days passed at the weeklong, closed-door sessions, there were 
moments of candor. Given a copy of "The New KGB," a book by two American 
authors, Zvezdenkov perused a list of names, places and dates of KGB operations 
-- and began making corrections in the margins. "Not a bad book," he told an 
American counterpart. "But it doesn't know as much about us as it claims." 
</P>
<P>
At other junctures, both the former U.S. and the Soviet intelligence officials 
were teasingly inquisitive about each other. 
</P>
<P>
Ray S. Cline, former CIA deputy director and one of the U.S. delegates, got 
wind of Zvezdenkov's six years of service in Cuba. "Were you in Havana during 
the Cuban missile crisis?" he asked Zvezdenkov. "I was deeply involved. I gave 
the pictures of the missile sites to President Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I was stationed there a year later," Zvezdenkov replied. Then he turned on 
his America counterpart and asked, "And what about you? Were you also involved 
in the Bay of Pigs?" No, Cline told him; he was in Asia then. 
</P>
<P>
In another exchange between Sherbak and former CIA director William Colby, the 
Soviet said that he had read Colby's book and enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than dwell on the past, the focus throughout the talks was on the 
future. And there, the change was noticeable and substantive -- especially for 
Sherbak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confined to a Room 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the virtual fete he was given last week, in 1956 while traveling 
route back from the Olympic games in Melbourne, Australia, Sherbak -- the 
manager of the Soviet boxing, weight-lifting and wrestling teams -- spent 10 
hours in transit in Los Angeles. The Soviet teams and managers were herded 
together and isolated in a room, he recalled, bitterly, adding, "We were not 
even allowed to go to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
On this trip, though, after decades of attempting to conceal his identity, 
Sherbak also made his television debut. He was a guest, with Colby, on ABC's 
"Nightline," which dispatched a stretch limo to fetch him. The show's subject 
was the potential for the United States and the Soviet Union to share 
intelligence on matters of mutual interest, specifically international 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the doubt expressed beforehand by U.S. officials that the informal 
talks with the Soviets would produce anything more than vague principles, the 
generals were, in fact, forthcoming on specific means of sharing intelligence 
to combat terrorism. Among the final recommendations were bold measures, 
including exchanges of information about terrorist groups' movements, plans and 
arms purchases, punishment of groups who target innocents, and even the 
recovery of missiles that might get into the hands of terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also were candid about the price they might have to pay for 
cooperating with the United States. "Once the word is out that we are 
cooperating with the CIA, then the terrorist groups are going to reorder their 
priorities -- to include us. We'll become targets," Sherbak said. 
</P>
<P>
But while in Southern California, the Soviets also had other targets, such as 
shopping at the malls. Among their favorite purchases: jumper cables and 
assorted repair supplies for cars, paper diapers, tennis shoes and winter 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
On one outing, Zvezdenkov was escorted by a young American interpreter and her 
friend from a Soviet Jewish family which emigrated to Los Angeles 15 years ago. 
They helped the general buy underwear for his wife. Zvezdenkov asked how the 
Soviet emigres had accumulated enough money for the young woman to afford a new 
Mustang convertible and inquired about American dating habits, recalling that 
in his day it took great courage just to kiss a girl. After hearing 
descriptions of modern courting customs, he lamented that they were the same in 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
On a walk on the ocean front to Venice, the generals were intrigued with the 
live mannequins in a store window and said they found it strange that 
California women wear so much black. Where, they also wanted to know, were all 
the tall buildings for which America was famous? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protective Hosts 
</P>
<P>
By mid-week, the dialogue had progressed to the stage that the Americans had 
become protective of their KGB guests. During an evening at the Cirque du 
Soleil playing under a big top on Santa Monica's oceanfront, the generals 
became tired and decided to leave at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't let them walk alone through the streets of Santa Monica by 
themselves," said Bonnie Pearlman, the assistant to Search for Common Ground, a 
public interest group that co-sponsored the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"And just how do you propose protecting them?" replied one American. "What are 
you going to do -- tell any assailant that they're confronting the KGB? Things 
have not progressed that far -- yet."

TOLL-FREE LINE SEEKS TO CURB ANIMAL ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Sgt. Cori Whetstone approaches the yard of knee-high dry weeds, downed 
clotheslines and discarded, dusty furniture, her hunch proves correct: Amid the 
debris, lying between an old sofa and a junked television console, is a 
malnourished dog. 
</P>
<P>
She crouches near the skinny Siberian husky. 
</P>
<P>
"Come here, boy," she says sweetly. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that's a good boy," she adds while the dog slowly manages to stand, its 
tail wagging at Whetstone, a complete stranger but a friend who has come to 
rescue the animal from reported neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a new toll-free number -- (800) 540-SPCA -- eyewitnesses now can 
more quickly report animal cruelty, and dogs, cats, horses and even exotic 
animals that are abused, beaten, abandoned and worse, are getting much-needed 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Since the tip line, sponsored by the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals, began operating in late August, more than 300 calls have 
been received from Los Angeles County animal lovers. 
</P>
<P>
As an investigator with the society, it is Whetstone's job -- shared with five 
others -- to ensure that the animals are rescued, nursed back to life and 
adopted by caring owners. 
</P>
<P>
The LA/SPCA crews also work with law enforcement agencies to investigate occult 
activities involving animals used in rituals; pet shop abuses, and in arresting 
operators of dog fighting and cockfighting rings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full Police Powers 
</P>
<P>
Whetstone, a senior investigator and licensed animal health technician (the 
equivalent of a registered nurse for animal care), has full police powers in 
animal cases. She and her fellow investigators are graduates of both the State 
Humane and Reserve Police Officers' academies. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, answering distress calls, Whetstone has traveled across the 
county -- sometimes logging as many as 200 miles a day in a high-tech van 
equipped with two-way radios, cages, a cellular phone and an emergency 
earthquake kit. 
</P>
<P>
She says she never ceases to be amazed at the cruelty she sees -- from 
emaciated horses to a dog chained around a post and left for dead -- that 
animals are forced to endure at the hands of their alleged best friends: human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what makes a person react so cruelly to an animal that is 
basically helpless, an animal who has come to depend on his owner for food and 
shelter," she says. "It is us, mankind, who has domesticated these animals and 
us who are mistreating them." 
</P>
<P>
The hot line was started to avert such abuses, Whetstone says, adding, "We want 
to bring public awareness to the community about the horrendous acts of 
violence against animals and let the people know that we are here to assist, to 
rescue these creatures and give them better homes." 
</P>
<P>
But more often than not, Whetstone and other investigators are met with 
contempt and threats when investigating cases. 
</P>
<P>
" 'What's a dog catcher doing with a gun?' is the usual response we get," she 
says. But what the public doesn't realize is that animal cruelty is a 
misdemeanor, punishable with a maximum $1,000 fine and up to a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentenced to Jail 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she says, a Los Angeles man was sentenced to 60 days in jail and 
fined $500 for poisoning a neighbor's dog because it knocked over his trash 
can. She took the poisoning complaint on the hot line from a relative of the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite sad," Whetstone says. "The man poisoned some chicken and placed 
it on top of the trash. The dog barely made it into the kitchen and died in its 
owner's arms." 
</P>
<P>
Whetstone said the society could have offered the man advice on how to speak to 
the dog's owner to solve the problem before he took his drastic step. 
"Poisoning is a cold act," she said. "And now the whole neighborhood knows what 
happened and it's not the best situation for the man's family."

CHILDHOOD FEARS REFLECT ADULT ANXIETIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MARBELLA, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bad dogs. The wrong clothes. Bigger kids. Drug dealers. Parents dying. Or 
divorcing. Nuclear war. Having sex. Not having sex. 
</P>
<P>
How did childhood and adolescence ever get the reputation of being carefree 
years? 
</P>
<P>
"These kids," sighs Anna Dotson, a guidance counselor at a Baltimore elementary 
school, "have a lot they're confronting." 
</P>
<P>
While the worries of youth seem to pale next to adult concerns like mortgages 
and marriages, they're just as real and just as monumental from a kid's-eye 
view of the world, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Substitutions 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, children's fears have changed over the years. Substitute today's 
worries about crack dealers and AIDS for yesterday's worries about war and the 
Depression. But, mainly, children have always had to face the same sort of 
bogeymen, whatever their current incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
"Life changes," says Leon Rosenberg, Ph.D., a child psychologist at the Johns 
Hopkins Hospital Children's Center in Baltimore. "Children before never knew to 
be afraid of smoking, for example. But children have always worried about 
threats to their parents and, now, if their parents smoke, they worry that 
they're going to die. 
</P>
<P>
"With young children in general, the fears really don't change much. The 
younger child has fears of unknown things, bad things. For a 4- or 5-year-old, 
it's monsters; for a 6- or 7-year-old, it's Freddy Krueger. He may know it's 
just a movie, but it embodies things that frighten him. It's typical for a 
normal child to sort of have vague fears of monsters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Aware at That Age' 
</P>
<P>
"By 7, 8, 9 years old, there's a tendency to get nervous about strangers, bad 
people, fire, because they're more aware at that age of things happening in the 
neighborhood, the community," says Rosenberg. "They'll say, 'I can't sleep 
because there are robbers in the house.' It will occur more intensely if 
there's been a robbery in the neighborhood. Those are common fears at the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
A little bit of worrying is normal -- and, in fact, worrying about a fear can 
help ease it. 
</P>
<P>
"A certain amount of anxiety is salutary," says Dr. John Goldenring, a 
California child psychiatrist who has studied children's fears. "It appears 
that those who have dealt with their fears are better off than those who 
haven't." 
</P>
<P>
But when does a healthy anxiety turn unhealthy? 
</P>
<P>
"A child shouldn't be spending any significant amount of energy worrying about 
it," says Rosenberg. "With a fear of robbers, for example, maybe they can't 
fall asleep right away, or when twilight comes around they might be scared. But 
they shouldn't worry about it during the day. If it's interrupting the child's 
play during the day, something's wrong. There's too much anxiety in the home." 
</P>
<P>
Often, he says, children's fears are a reflection of their parents' anxiety 
levels. "That's where they get their security," he says. "If they see parents 
fall apart, 8-year-olds will fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
Parents often find themselves caught between keeping their children safe from 
the dangers of the world and making them fearful of every new person and 
everything outside their doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'World's Not Trustworthy' 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to frighten the child, but you don't want them to trust the 
world -- because the world's not trustworthy," says Judy Estes, a mother of 
two. "I have to consciously guard against overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember roaming the woods when I was a child," says Estes, whose children 
are 2- and 6-years-old. "My daughter understands she can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Parents can make children wary of outside dangers without frightening them by 
explaining things in a "matter-of-fact, relaxed way," says Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how upset you get," he says. "You should tell them, 'I don't 
want you talking to strangers. Most are good, but there are a couple of weirdos 
out there. If a stranger comes up to talk to you, walk away. If a stranger 
comes up to you and says your mommy sent me to get you, tell them I'll never 
send a stranger to get you.' 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, kids will get a little frightened" by these discussions, he 
says. "But you make it clear to them, and you remain firm and calm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Anxiety 
</P>
<P>
Often, children won't come out and say what they're afraid of and, instead, 
will exhibit anxiety in other ways -- refusing to go to school, or acting up at 
home or in the classroom. In fact, teachers and counselors often are the first 
to realize that a child is suffering from unresolved fears because that's often 
where problems first crop up. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, school itself can present a multitude of worries. 
</P>
<P>
Shelia Davis, a guidance counselor at a Baltimore middle school in the midst of 
an impoverished, troubled neighborhood, says her charges often confront fears 
that more middle-class children never face. 
</P>
<P>
She's had students who got pregnant and were told by a relative, "Good, we need 
another check anyway"; students who have to feed and dress and get their 
younger siblings to school before they can get themselves off to class; 
students who don't have breakfast before school or anything to wear. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot teach somebody something if they're hungry," she says. "Or if they 
don't have something to wear. They worry, if I wear the same thing to school 
tomorrow, will everyone make fun of me? You think at that young of an age, they 
wouldn't think they would worry about clothes, but they do. 
</P>
<P>
"They worry, are they going to get beat up on the way home?" she says. "If you 
don't live in the area, sometimes you're scorned, and you might get beat up 
before school or after school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Change 
</P>
<P>
As children grow older, their fears naturally change as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Most are concerned about sex," said Monik Williams, 15, a junior at Baltimore 
City College Senior High School. "Most have been pressured whether to have sex 
or not." 
</P>
<P>
Williams worked this summer on a hot line run by Baltimore city schools for 
kids to call if they needed someone to talk to. Many calls tended to be about 
boyfriend or girlfriend problems, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy who keeps calling, he let his friends talk him into having sex, now he 
feels guilty about it," she says. "At school, it's the same. People are always 
talking about it, worrying about it." 
</P>
<P>
On the list of her own big fears, Williams puts "AIDS, our country's leaders 
and where they're taking us in the future, the diminishing of the ozone layer, 
health in general and health of little children."

EUROPEANS WANT LESS U.S., MORE HOMEGROWN TV

<P>
About 300 leaders from Europe's film and television industry debated Sunday how 
to deepen cooperation as a way to revive their sagging fortunes and better 
compete against American imports. 
</P>
<P>
Large new markets inherent in Europe's satellite television revolution are at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
The sessions, organized by the French government and due to end late today with 
a set of concrete recommendations and proposals for action, unfold amid a 
heated debate in Europe over the need for quotas to limit foreign -- mainly 
American -- productions. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-nation European Community is scheduled to decide Tuesday whether to 
adopt a legally binding directive calling on member states to ensure that 
broadcasters -- "where practicable and by appropriate means" -- reserve a 
majority of their transmission time for European works. 
</P>
<P>
The directive excludes news, sports, advertising and teletext services from the 
quota provision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of barriers," insisted Claude Santelli, the head of a 
French audiovisual artists group. "We are an endangered species. You can't have 
a tree unless you nourish the sapling." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. government and film industry officials have strongly opposed quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"Creativity can't be fenced in," Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture 
Association of America, said in a telephone interview from his Washington 
office. "American movies have been in France, Italy, Germany, and elsewhere in 
Europe for 60 years, and I've not noticed any cultural collapse in these 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
While American government officials and film industry leaders have argued 
strongly against quotas, participants at the Paris meeting believe the 
likelihood is good that the directive will win acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
In its present form, however, the provision on European content would appear to 
have little practical impact. 
</P>
<P>
According to EC figures, imported American programming presently constitutes 
about 40% of total entertainment broadcastings. 
</P>
<P>
EC officials involved in drafting the directive also noted that the words 
"where practicable" effectively provide an escape for any nation not wanting to 
follow the spirit of the proposed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, France, the key opponent to the directive, is opposed precisely because 
it believes it is too weak. 
</P>
<P>
France is pressing for tougher language that would bind countries to the 
majority quota without loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
A French vote against the current proposal would likely begin a search for a 
more strongly worded directive on quotas rather than mark any end to the issue, 
observers here predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all completely up to the French," declared an EC official who helped 
draft the directive. 
</P>
<P>
Those opposed to quotas see greater cooperation and more co-production among 
Europeans as the key to developing the size and financial muscle required to 
compete against American products. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is one of the world's most lucrative, yet complex, television markets. 
</P>
<P>
According to a study compiled by the London-based consultant Deloitte Haskins 
and Sells, the West European broadcasting market currently consists of about 
140 million television households fragmented into 23 distinct broadcasting 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
As cable and satellite television comes of age, the study predicts, the number 
of channels available to European viewers will double over the next decade from 
about 3 1/2 24-hour channels to about seven. 
</P>
<P>
The present debate in Europe centers heavily on who will provide the 
programming for this expanded market. 
</P>
<P>
European producers are struggling to meet the existing demand in Europe. 
According to French President Francois Mitterrand, who delivered Saturday's 
keynote speech, European program demand was 125,000 hours last year, but 
European producers turned out only 20,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of those present at the Paris meeting believe that the key to the 
industry's revival lies not in quotas but in greater cooperation and improved 
education and training. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems little support for quotas over the long term," said Colin Young, 
head of Britain's National Film Theatre School. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting marks one of the first-ever attempts by representatives 
of diverse European nations to search for common ground in an important 
cultural field. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings, organized under the auspices of the European Community, reflect 
the growing breadth and momentum on the part of the 12 countries to forge a 
deeper unity. 
</P>
<P>
The EC countries are already pledged to create a single, unified market with a 
free flow of goods, services, people and capital by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be content with an economic Europe," Mitterrand told the opening 
plenary session Saturday. "Perhaps now there is a need to start thinking in 
terms of a European culture. . . ." One session at the meeting addressed the 
question of European identity, with delegates attempting to define it. 
</P>
<P>
But free-wheeling sessions on such emotive subjects as creativity and copyright 
demonstrated how deeply fragmented Europe remains culturally. 
</P>
<P>
Young, for example, noted that only 8% of all European television productions 
ever leave their country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a minority of (European) writers who can write something that will 
attract interest across borders and only a few producers who can make such 
productions." 
</P>
<P>
Often, he noted, the most popular shows in one country simply fail to travel 
into a neighboring country. 
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting explained that only in recent years have the 
economics of European television -- traditionally heavily state-funded -- 
forced producers to search for funds beyond their own borders. 
</P>
<P>
Together with director Richard Attenborough, Young called for immediate funding 
to establish post-graduate university programs in Europe for writers, producers 
and directors. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a crisis of writing and production in the European television and film 
industries and there's a crisis in the profession that is supposed to train 
these disciplines," Young told journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand called for special funding institutions to support screen writers 
and producers in making new productions during what he called "this decisive 
phase." 
</P>
<P>
He also called for increased co-production among Europeans from different 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Today American shows together with Japanese technology dominate to a large 
extent the European market," said Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
Those attending the meetings stressed the need to streamline the Continent's 
bewildering technical jungle of differing television transmission systems, 
encrypters and antennas. 
</P>
<P>
Italian producer Alfredo Bini talked of extending movie theater hours in Europe 
to show satellite-transmitted television programs from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
With up to eight audio channels accompanying the same picture, several 
different languages can be handled, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a European unity in terms of technology," he predicted. "There's 
a political will to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Debates on whether to dub or subtitle foreign language films also ran into 
differing European cultural habits and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Europeans tend to prefer subtitles; the Germans, along with southern 
Europeans prefer dubbed films; and the British are unhappy with both. 
</P>
<P>
French actors and writers also expressed resentment at being forced to produce 
films in English for international markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to defend our cultural heritage or will we be forced to act in 
English?" asked Simon Aurore, head of an independent actors organization. 
</P>
<P>
Others however, such as Young, argued it was impossible to preserve a cultural 
purity in film-making without sacrificing commercial viability. 
</P>
<P>
"The producer chooses which way to go, you can't have both," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
"We must fight for national culture at home, but be European and find the 
common ground where we can be European together."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: EDUCATORS PUT NEW LABEL ON DUMB CAMPUS PRANKS

Alan Arkin once starred in a giggly little movie called "Simon." 
</P>
<P>
Arkin plays an oddball psychology professor who submits to a mind-altering 
experiment that makes him think he's from another planet. His girlfriend, 
played by Madeline Kahn, then accuses him of acting alienated. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I'm alienated," Arkin responds. "I'm an alien." 
</P>
<P>
What brings this to mind is that colleges and universities seem to have 
discovered that 
</P>
<P>
students sometimes act sophomoric. The reason seems to have eluded them. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, administrators have created a new category of student misconduct -- 
insensitivity -- and a new way of stomping it out. Students found guilty are 
being sentenced to a re-education camp regimen to straighten out their 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
At San Diego State University, two male Anglos wear sombreros and serapes while 
selling nachos on the Quad. Bingo, a committee is established to review any 
future "ethnic" celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
At UC San Diego, a fraternity brings a stripper on campus to wallow in some 
oil. In a plea bargain, the frat cops out to sexual harassment and agrees to 
listen to feminist lectures. 
</P>
<P>
It's unclear just who was being harassed. No complaints were heard from the 
several hundred howling, foot-stomping fellows in the all-male audience. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that one of the female complainants was later reported to have hired 
a male stripper for a birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
As in so many academic things, the University of California is a leader in the 
movement toward mandatory civility. 
</P>
<P>
UC President David P. Gardner last week announced that, effective immediately, 
students can be punished, even kicked out, for using words "widely recognized 
to be derogatory references to race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual 
orientation, disability and other personal characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that this isn't for the heavy stuff: hazing, threats, prolonged 
harassment, physical intimidation. That's already covered in the student 
conduct code, as well as various state and federal statutes. 
</P>
<P>
This is more for the lesser stuff: dormitory dust-ups, locker room jostling, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
Surely Gardner doesn't mean to ban all insults. A campus where verbal knife 
fights occur only in Faculty Senate meetings would be a dull place indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gardner's rules, the old "Saturday Night Live" insult, "Jane, you 
ignorant slut," is obviously verboten. The rural epithet, "You frequenter of 
small, slow-moving heifers," is probably banned under the "sex, sexual 
orientation, disability" covenants. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite of mine, "you guano-brained numskull," might be covered under "other 
personal characteristics," but it's difficult to tell. 
</P>
<P>
What we need is a list of officially sanctioned insults, ripostes and 
knockdowns. Maybe there's a federal grant available to do some research in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Building a Majority 
</P>
<P>
Worried about a slow-growth majority taking over the City Council, the Building 
Industry Assn. is planning a furious fight in the 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
The BIA political action committee sent out an "urgent immediate attention" 
letter to BIA members seeking support for Bob Trettin's campaign against 
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our industry and the very jobs we represent here in San Diego are at stake," 
the BIA letter says. " . . . If your company does not have someone assigned to 
help (get out the vote) on Election Day, we need your assistance in getting 
this done."

LOAN OKD FOR OLYMPIC TRAINING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian Sunday approved a controversial $15-million loan to help 
build a year-round Olympic training center near Chula Vista, but only after 
extracting an unusual written promise from a San Diego nonprofit group to make 
good on the money. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he asked for the guarantee from the San Diego National Sports 
Training Foundation before signing into law a bill that dips into the state's 
general fund to help finance the $70-million facility planned for 154 acres 
overlooking the Lower Otay Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commemorative License Plates 
</P>
<P>
The measure, sponsored by Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), has 
raised eyebrows here because it gives the foundation $5 million during each of 
the next three years but does not specifically require the nonprofit group to 
reimburse the state. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Campbell's bill would pay back the loan by selling new Olympic 
Training Center commemorative license plates -- a scheme that has been 
criticized by some legislators as unrealistic and a "give-away." 
</P>
<P>
An analysis by the Department of Motor Vehicles indicated that, at the rate 
people were willing to buy the plates for $100 a pair, it would take 142 years 
to make up the $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, the bill passed out of the Legislature last month after a personal 
lobbying effort by Campbell, who told his colleagues that a training center 
would be an economic and public-relations boon for California. He also said 
that many former Olympic athletes living in California would be mobilized to 
hawk the license plates and accelerate the pay back. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the uncertainty of the license plate sales apparently bothered Deukmejian, 
who directed his staff to extract the promise from the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I originally had concerns that the source of revenue provided in this 
bill would be insufficient to repay the loan to the state, I have received 
assurances in writing from the San Diego National Sports Training Foundation 
that they will enter into a written contract with the Department of Commerce to 
guarantee repayment of the loan," Deukmejian said Sunday in a message issued 
with the announcement that he had approved the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I am satisfied that state resources will not be jeopardized by 
enactment of this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details to Be Worked Out 
</P>
<P>
David Nielsen, director of the San Diego foundation, said Sunday that the 
nonprofit group didn't hesitate to make the loan guarantee when the Department 
of Commerce called him in the last few days with the governor's request. While 
the details of the guarantee are still to be worked out, Nielsen said the 
foundation is "quite willing to put our money into marketing" the proposed 
Olympic Training Center tags. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt comfortable guaranteeing it (the loan) based on the Los Angeles 
experience in 1984," Nielsen said, referring to the $2 million raised by the 
state from the sale of special license plates during the 1984 Los Angeles 
Summer Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Campbell introduced his bill for the criticized loan, Deukmejian 
had been approached privately by at least one prominent San Diegan about the 
idea of building an Olympic Training Center near Chula Vista. Developer Ernest 
Hahn, architect of San Diego's downtown redevelopment and a member of the 
sports training foundation board, gave Deukmejian and his wife an aerial tour 
of the proposed training center last year, the governor's press secretary 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The tour took place Nov. 27, when the Deukmejians were riding in Hahn's plane 
from Long Beach to San Diego to see a 49ers-Chargers football game as a guest 
of Charger owner Alex Spanos, said Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Before landing in San Diego, Brett said, Hahn had his plane circle over the 
proposed Olympic training center site for the benefit of the governor. "The 
governor is familiar with the geographic location of the site as a result of 
the tour," Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
The site, west of the Otay reservoir, was donated by the EastLake Development 
Co., a partnership that includes the politically powerful J.G. Boswell Co. 
agribusiness firm of Los Angeles. It is also contiguous to the former Otay 
Ranch, which was recently purchased by the Baldwin Company, a large Orange 
County development firm. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the training facility call for 250,000 square feet of buildings, 
including a 300-bed dormitory and 1.5 million square feet of outdoor training 
areas. Construction is expected to begin in the spring and be completed in 18 
months -- enough time to help American athletes train for the 1992 Summer Games 
in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the property, private fund-raising efforts by the foundation so far 
have yielded $7 million in pledges, and Nielsen said about $1.2 million of that 
will be collected by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation signed by Deukmejian requires the foundation to match its $5 
million in state loans each year with private donations, a task that Nielsen 
said he is confident can be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Nielsen said Sunday, the $15-million state loan is a "major 
contribution" to the effort to build a training center. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the center "will bring significant benefits to the state . . 
. as one of the capitals of international amateur sports activity."

NEIGHBORS FORCE CLOSURE OF HOME FOR AIDS VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Oceanside, a plain-looking beige stucco house sits on a hillside in a quiet 
upper-middle-class neighborhood. It blends into the surroundings with such ease 
that one would never know its residents have drawn the attention of a 
homeowners' association that has deemed them unsuitable neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the eight residents, all of them suffering from the advanced stages of 
AIDS, are even aware of the controversy or of their impending eviction. Most of 
them are too far gone to notice. 
</P>
<P>
But Ray Beierle, founder of the home known as Fraternity House, has taken 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody laughs and says, 'What are you gonna do now, Ray?' " said the 
66-year-old war veteran and former nurse. "I say, 'Hey, you can't keep this old 
man down. I'm gonna give 'em a run for their money as long as I can. What have 
I got to lose?' " 
</P>
<P>
Though the Henie Hills Homeowners Assn. has asked for their ouster and the 
owner of the house has refused to renew the lease, which expires Jan. 1, 
Beierle is not going to pack his bags and disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, he opened a new rented home for North County people with 
AIDS, taking four of Fraternity House's current residents with him. 
</P>
<P>
Beierle says he has learned from his mistakes and anticipates no problems in 
the new house. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility will not be affiliated with Fraternity House and will be 
called simply "Ray Beierle's House." The semi-rural location of the 
seven-bedroom home is a secret but, he says, "it makes this house look like 
Skid Row." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patients to Move 
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of Fraternity House plans to relocate the remaining 
patients and continue business as usual after they are forced out of the Valley 
Road house, board chairman Gary Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The board of directors has hired a replacement for Beierle, who will oversee 
the waning days of the house on Valley Road and will move with Fraternity House 
to a new location. Beginning today, Violet Osborn, 59, will be paid $2,000 a 
month to manage Fraternity House, with the help of newly hired assistant 
manager Douglas Millsap. 
</P>
<P>
Osborn spent 18 years on the board of directors of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
of San Diego, but says her real education in life-threatening illnesses began a 
little over a year ago when her son was diagnosed with AIDS. "I think all of us 
have to really be aware of what's happening to our young people," Osborn said 
Sunday as she was looking around Fraternity House and preparing for her new 
job. "There's such a need here . . . I felt I had to do something of a positive 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I saw the house and met the people working here, and saw the caring 
. . . It's everything I would want my son to experience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent afternoon last week while Beierle was still in charge found most of 
the residents asleep, as they often are. Two of the more mobile residents 
watched television game shows in the den, and one sat on the back porch 
enjoying the cool breeze riffling through citrus trees in the yard, while 
golfers played the El Camino Country Club course next door. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the house is as quiet as the outside, and the only immediate 
clues that it is not just any suburban residence are the wheelchairs stored 
under the stairway and the visiting-hours sign posted in the front hallway. 
Watercolor paintings by the residents adorn the walls and Buffy, a friendly 
cocker spaniel, greets visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Buffy also oversees the farewells. 
</P>
<P>
"She goes from room to room and if somebody is close to dying, she goes and 
lays close to them," Beierle said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Held Various Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Beierle, a widower, once managed a motel, worked in real estate, then bought a 
citrus ranch in Texas to retire on. But a cold snap turned his fruit into 
"$4,000 worth of frozen Popsicles" and ruined his retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
He turned to nursing to make a living and said the experience of working for a 
home nursing company in Escondido moved him to help AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept being sent out to these patients and seeing them die in the 
circumstances they did," he said. "I thought if there was anything I could do 
to make it easier for them, I would. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my career now. I enjoy it, I like it, I feel I need it and, without 
being a braggart, I feel I can do it better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
There are four private shelters in San Diego County that house AIDS patients, 
but Fraternity House is the only one in North County. It is also the only one 
that takes people who are very close to death. 
</P>
<P>
"We get them only when they can no longer take care of themselves," Beierle 
said. "This is the last stop." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vigils Discouraged 
</P>
<P>
Beierle works with the families of the residents but discourages relatives from 
keeping 24-hour vigils at patients' bedsides. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell everybody when it's time to die, this is something we have to do by 
ourselves. There's no need to go to the hospital unless they are suffering in 
pain and have to go there to be made comfortable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual leaving is like being born in reverse. If there's no unusual 
problem, we just let them go quietly and lovingly." 
</P>
<P>
Beierle freely admits that he knew he was breaking the neighborhood rules, 
which call for a single family in each house. When he initially rented the 
house from a San Diego doctor, he said, he intended to live there with only his 
two sons and one AIDS patient named Don. 
</P>
<P>
"I just figured, 'What the hell, I might as well have more people and make it 
an AIDS home.' " 
</P>
<P>
As the population of the five-bedroom house gradually increased, Beierle gave 
up his master bedroom to house three more people. Financial troubles set in, so 
Fraternity House was incorporated as a nonprofit charitable organization and a 
12-member board of directors was elected in January. 
</P>
<P>
To date, 37 people with AIDS have passed through the doors. Some of them have 
improved to the point where they have been able to move back to their homes. 
Most have died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beat the Odds 
</P>
<P>
Beierle figures he beat the odds by successfully running an AIDS shelter for 
nearly two years right under the noses of the watchful neighbors. After all, 
there is nothing really noticeable about the house to announce its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Except, there was that one time when an addled resident wandered out of the 
house in his backless hospital gown and into a neighbor's garage. Then, there 
was the other confused man who hiked down the hill to spontaneously join a 
meeting of corporate executives at the country club. 
</P>
<P>
But the immediate neighbors, even the ones who had figured it out, didn't 
really seem to mind those things, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beierle figures his cover was blown in September, 1988, when he publicly 
advertised the fact that he was looking for another home to expand the 
operation. His plea drew a fair amount of attention from the media, not to 
mention the neighbors and the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the county Health Services Department served Beierle with a 
cease-and-desist order because it determined that he was running a nursing home 
without a license and without the required round-the-clock medical care for the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Beierle countered that the home was nothing more than a residence for AIDS 
sufferers, not a medical facility. The problem eventually was solved by having 
each occupant sign a rent-sharing agreement, and pay $500 a month for rent, 
meals and laundry service. The nursing, cooking and cleaning help, provided by 
the county In-Home Support Services program, is paid for from each resident's 
individual Social Security or medical coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The order was later rescinded when the department determined that the home was 
not technically a medical facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaint Filed 
</P>
<P>
But then a complaint was filed by an anonymous neighbor, and the Henie Hills 
Homeowners' Assn. ruled that a business or institution had no place in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"They are in full violation of our codes, covenants and restrictions," said Ted 
Lohrey, treasurer of the association. "It has nothing to do with the people 
there. We're not looking at it because they're AIDS patients and we want them 
out. You just can't have medical facilities, institutions or any type of 
business here, and that's exactly what it is. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Beierle knew he was against the rules. . . . He basically doesn't care 
about anything else but his business," Lohrey continued. "Presumably, he's 
making a profit off of this. I don't think he's just doing this out of the 
goodness of his heart." 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances and trucks carrying infectious waste routinely drive through the 
neighborhood, creating a general nuisance, he said. The board sent a notice to 
the house's owner requesting that the business cease immediately, Lohrey said, 
not in January when the lease expires. If the business continues to operate, 
the board may fine the homeowner and put a lien on the house if he refuses to 
pay, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be the bad guys," Lohrey said. "We don't want gay rights 
groups and AIDS patients coming up here picketing our neighborhood and 
threatening our board of directors. . . . We just want them to follow the rules 
of our neighborhood like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Move on Jan. 1 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a clinical psychologist who works with AIDS patients, said the board of 
directors of Fraternity House has no plans to move the residents before Jan. 1, 
unless they find another home before then. Lewis said it was his understanding 
that attorneys for both sides had agreed that simply allowing the lease to 
lapse would be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Disputing Lohrey's contention that profit was being made on the operation, 
Lewis said, "We're more than happy to provide any kind of budget reports. . . . 
In general, we've been running about $5,000 a month in the hole." Lewis said 
the facility is run entirely on private donations and that fund-raisers usually 
help fill the gaps. Though each resident is asked to pay about $500 a month to 
cover his own rent and expenses, in reality they pay only what they can afford 
and some pay nothing at all, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The other AIDS homes in the county include the Truax House, named after the 
late gay activist Dr. Brad Truax and run by the AIDS Assistance Fund; the 
Joshua House run by the Catholic Diocese, and the Methodist Church's Ariel 
House. All three are in downtown San Diego and house only people who are still 
mobile and able to care for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Our House, also run by the AIDS Assistance Fund, closed recently because the 
organization couldn't afford to provide the full-time nurse required by the 
state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, that's about it. It's a really desperate situation," said 
Tom Ball, a San Diego AIDS Project volunteer. "It's not basically very easy to 
get into a nursing home. . . . They're not very happy to accept people who are 
HIV-positive. I've had people walk in here who have AIDS and don't know where 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Even those who have families, sometimes it's too much for them to take care of 
the person with AIDS," Ball said. "For the majority of people who are on their 
own, there seems to be a real need for some kind of place like Fraternity 
House, for people who can't take care of themselves."

SOLD ON BUSINESS PARK;

<P>
INDUSTRIAL AREA SEEN AS SOLUTION TO POWAY'S PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a scruffy, dry stretch of rolling hills in south Poway that has been good 
for nothing much except mining gravel and grazing cattle. 
</P>
<P>
Now it promises to become a pot of gold for the 9-year-old "city in the 
country" -- a 2,500-acre industrial park that eventually will contain 12 
million square feet of building space. 
</P>
<P>
However, the building of such a huge development in Poway, a bastion of 
slow-growth and less-is-nice philosophy, where gardens and horses are part of a 
cherished life style, takes some explaining. 
</P>
<P>
Poway's incorporation as a city in 1980 was driven by the desire to keep 
rampant growth from the area. But now Poway is welcoming the developers who are 
turning the open hills into the South Poway Planned Community, the euphemism 
for what will be one of the county's largest industrial parks. 
</P>
<P>
What turned the Poway City Council and the community around was the prospect 
that the industrial park will solve the city's two most pressing problems: the 
need for tax revenues and a solution to traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rush-Hour Traffic Jams 
</P>
<P>
Poway Road, the city's main street, is the only direct route between inland 
communities and Interstate 15. It has become jammed with morning and evening 
commuter traffic. The commuter crush rankles Poway residents and is bad for 
Poway Road merchants. The traffic blocks customers from businesses and few of 
the hurried commuters stop for more than gas or a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, owners of land on the south side of town proposed an 
industrial park that would be out of sight of most residents, along with the 
building of an east-west expressway to serve both the business park and 
commuters. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-growth City Council gave a reluctant nod to "at least look at a 
proposal if we came up with one," according to Martin Lotz, a transplanted 
former mayor of Culver City and one of the owners of the property in south 
Poway. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Shepardson, a member of the original City Council, remembers those early 
discussions differently. Shepardson, a slow-growth advocate, said the prospect 
of getting the out-of-town commuters off Poway Road "was the carrot that 
attracted us." 
</P>
<P>
Lotz admits the early years of the ambitious project contained a lot of 
missteps and a few downright errors before the landowners formed into the 
Buehler Property Owners' Assn., named after a pionner Poway family, and came up 
with a successful plan. 
</P>
<P>
One practice that the landowners followed -- inviting everybody and anybody in 
to see what they were planning -- is credited by Lotz and others with turning 
the property owners' dreams into reality. 
</P>
<P>
"We had meetings, dozens of meetings," Lotz recalled. "We invited them to each 
and every one. And a lot of them came." 
</P>
<P>
Neville Bothwell, another of the 42 owners of the 2,500 acres of south Poway 
land involved in the the industrial park, kept count. There were 40 planning 
sessions. Detailed minutes of each meeting were sent out promptly to each 
property owners' group and to key city officials. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Buehler group listened. 
</P>
<P>
The city wanted an east-west bypass route to relieve congested Poway Road and 
the South Poway Parkway idea was born. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents of an area known as The Beeler Creek residents didn't want any 
part of the industrial revolution. So The steep slopes to the north of the 
creek bed will remain untouched, masking the massive cut-and-fill operations 
that will create nearly 800 acres of building pads that are out of sight in a 
hollow above the homes. in a hollow swale high above, that is out of si 
</P>
<P>
The city wanted a tax base that would support the urban services without 
disturbing their rural life style. or digging deeply into their pocketbooks? No 
problem. The industrial park would provide the solution. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to all the (town council) meetings before there was a city, and to all 
the City Council meetings. We helped in the (city council candidate's) 
campaigns," Lotz said, adding there probably were few people in town who 
weren't familiar with the proposals and progress of the plans. 
</P>
<P>
When the project arrived before the Poway City Council for final approval in 
late 1985, there was hardly a voice of dissent from the audience and few 
questions from the council, Lotz recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But Ex-Councilwoman Shepardson remembers it a bit differently. That 1985 
version of the South Poway Planned Community and the reality of the emerging 
business park are out of sync, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shepardson believes that she and other city leaders were misled on the visual 
impact of the industrial park for the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I have serious reservations," she said. "It is much more visible than the 
(1985) council was led to believe." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of glimpses of the industrial buildings from the Poway valley, there 
are silhouettes along the ridgelines and raw earth "V's" where the developers 
lopped off the tops of the hills and filled in the valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Poway City Manager Jim Bowersox, the city's top administrator since its 
incorporation, shrugs at the thought that Poway has sold out its rural 
character. 
</P>
<P>
Bowersox is seen by both developers and Poway residents as the key figure in 
negotiating the development agreement and obtaining the highway bypass in the 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial park and the east-west South Poway Parkway, linking California 
67 on the east with Interstate 15 on the west, bodes nothing but good for 
Poway, Bowersox believes. 
</P>
<P>
The dust and the truck traffic that now disturb a small portion of the 
community as builders move 22 million cubic yards of earth to create the first 
segment of the business park will soon be gone. The crunch of traffic on Poway 
Road will vanish when the six-lane South Poway Parkway opens at the Mercy 
Road-I-15 interchange by the end of next year, Bowersox said. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic that the commuters and the industrial park will bring -- estimated 
at 167,000 cars a day in a "worst-case scenario" -- won't travel local roads 
once the expressway is built, but the property taxes and the sales taxes 
generated by the project will flow into city coffers for years to come, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It takes $70,000 a year to maintain a single city park, Bowersox pointed out, 
and the tax money from the industrial park will pay for the city services for 
residents and industrialists alike, years into the future. 
</P>
<P>
A Poway city staffer, who asked that his name not be used, called the 
industrial park a happy compromise for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"By setting aside a tenth of the city's area for industrial development in an 
out-of-the-way place that doesn't bother many people, the city can stay rural 
and still have the money to build a new city hall or a cultural center," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Johnson, senior sales consultant for Coldwell Banker Commercial, roved the 
county for three years seeking a site for an industrial park before he hit pay 
dirt struck gold in Poway. He became the catalyst that brought together the 
developer, the property owners and the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Cadillac Fairview, a Canadian-based development firm, was exactly what 
Poway needed to make the its redevelopment project AKA industrial park, work, 
according to Johnson. Cadillac Fairview had the financial resources to advance 
millions of dollars to build the roads, dig the sewers, bring in the water and 
rearrange the hills to make the 660-acre first phase of the industrial park 
come into being. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win-win situation," Johnson said, explaining that the city got its 
tax base, the property owners got premium prices for their land and Cadillac 
Fairview became the developer of what may be the last major industrial area in 
San Diego County's prime mid-section for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson describes the Pomerado Business Park -- Cadillac-Fairview's name for 
its 280 acres of building pads in South Poway -- as just what the market needs, 
and the response from businesses seems to bear out his claim. 
</P>
<P>
Flat land in San Diego County is at a premium, Johnson pointed out, and the 
city of San Diego has further curtailed the market by a citizen-initiated 
moratorium on development of much of the North City's undeveloped areas. 
</P>
<P>
Poway's industrial park gives the price-conscious business community just what 
it is looking for: a centrally located site where distribution costs will be 
lessened. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson can offer potential tenants a building at a cost $2 to $3 a square foot 
less than the Carmel Mountain Ranch industrial site along I-15 to the 
northwest, and at a much lower cost than the high-tech business parks along the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson believes the South Poway industrial park will an example of what the 
industrial jumble along Miramar Road could have been -- a well-planned, 
moderately priced industrial park where the essential "little guys" of industry 
can find a home. Sunshine Bakers, Executone, an offset printer, a moving firm, 
a Taiwanese manufacturer of golf clubs and a dozen other firms have already 
made the move.

Apple Growers Set Record Gross: Washington apple growers grossed an estimated 
record $493.6 million in the past year despite the scare over the chemical 
alar, calling into question the $9.5-million federal bailout of the industry. 
But industry leaders said the gross sales do not tell the full story because 
wholesale prices to farmers often lagged below the cost of production. The 
previous record was $488 million in 1986.

CHRISTMAS SPIRIT BRINGS TOP ACTS TO RECORD IN S.D. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, nearly 20 big-name recording artists got together in the studio 
as Band Aid and cut a single called "Do They Know It's Christmas?" to raise 
money for famine relief in Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
This year, in a San Diego-only benefit, an equally formidable cast of 
major-league pop, rock and country stars -- from Brian Wilson and Stevie Nicks 
to Loretta Lynn and the Oak Ridge Boys -- will contribute a song each to "The 
Stars Come Out for Christmas," a compilation of Christmas tunes to benefit 
Children's Hospital &amp; Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers figure they can sell 12,000 copies of the local production, 
scheduled for late November release on cassette and compact disc only, which 
will be sold exclusively in San Diego via mail order at a price not yet 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
According to the project's producer, Steve Vaus, 100% of the proceeds will go 
to the nonprofit health-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine or 10 years ago, I used to go to the hospital's play room with my guitar 
each Christmas season and play carols for the kids," said Vaus, who at the time 
was a struggling singer-songwriter in constant pursuit of more nightclub work. 
</P>
<P>
But today, as the head of a successful production company and recording studio 
that, since 1984, has produced commercial jingles for dozens of local and 
national businesses, Vaus said he's "finally in a position to help these kids 
in a substantially bigger way." 
</P>
<P>
"Roughly 40% of the hospital's patients do not have the ability to pay for 
their health care," said Vaus, 37, who is donating both his time and the use of 
his studio to the project. "So fund-raising is essential for the hospital to 
continue providing needy children with free medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt that those of us who have gifts or talents have a special 
responsibility to share those gifts or talents with those less fortunate. And 
what better time to do it than at Christmas?" 
</P>
<P>
Most of the heavyweight contributors to the project are sending in previously 
recorded tracks, including Nicks ("Silent Night"), Lynn ("Shadrach the Black 
Reindeer") and Lee Greenwood ("Oh Holy Night"). 
</P>
<P>
But at least five will be flying into San Diego during the first two weeks in 
October to record fresh tracks -- either standards or originals -- at Vaus' The 
Studio in Kearny Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: Brian Wilson, with his own newly penned "Christmas All Around the 
World"; the Commodores, with their version of "We Three Kings," and Juice 
Newton, with her arrangement of "The First Noel." 
</P>
<P>
"What's significant about this project, aside from raising money for the 
hospital, is the fact that we're accomplishing something in industry terms that 
people never thought possible -- we're getting major artists to record in San 
Diego," Vaus said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of producing music to raise money for Children's Hospital was first 
brought up several years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had done a theme song for the hospital for their annual telethon, and we 
discussed the possibility of making a charity album featuring only my 
material," Vaus recalled. "But frankly, I didn't think they would be able to 
raise too much money on that. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, we kept talking for the next few years, and then maybe two months ago 
it struck me that perhaps we could get major artists to do Christmas carols for 
a compilation album." 
</P>
<P>
Vaus' concept was enthusiastically endorsed by the hospital's fund-raising arm, 
the Children's Hospital Foundation, said telethon coordinator Sarah Boehmer. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thrilled and delighted," she said. "We rely heavily on fund-raising 
efforts in our community because of the amount of uncompensated care we provide 
to needy patients, and we're always eager to explore other avenues to raise 
money aside from our annual telethon." 
</P>
<P>
Given the go-ahead, Vaus and Children's Hospital Foundation volunteers 
immediately went to work. 
</P>
<P>
The first step was lining up sponsors "so we could guarantee the participating 
artists that 100% of the proceeds would go to the hospital," Vaus said. 
</P>
<P>
Star Systems, an automated teller machine network, agreed to underwrite 
production, manufacturing and distribution costs -- estimated at nearly 
$40,000. Eagle Limousines agreed to provide visiting artists with free 
transportation; the San Diego Marriott Hotel agreed to provide them with free 
accommodations. The next step was lining up the artists. In mid-August, Vaus 
said, he sent letters "to just over 100 acts, asking for their help." 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty much a shotgun approach. We went through all the music trade 
magazines and pulled out the names of significant artists we thought would be 
able to either take a traditional Christmas song and do something special with 
it or else come up with a suitable original tune. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't too many people we ruled out -- except for such obvious ones as 
Ozzy Osbourne," he laughed. "Somehow, we felt he just wouldn't fit in on a 
Christmas album." 
</P>
<P>
The response, Vaus said, was overwhelmingly positive. 
</P>
<P>
"We frankly didn't have a clue about what to expect. Trying to pull together 
such a wide variety of top recording artists for an album benefiting a local 
charity, we didn't know if we'd get turned down flat by everyone or what. 
</P>
<P>
"But, as it turned out, we must have hit a common chord or two -- Christmas and 
children. I'm really amazed by the fact that so many people have agreed to take 
part in this project. We're forced to do a double album as opposed to our 
original intention of doing just a single, 10-song album. 
</P>
<P>
"And I can't tell you how many of these artists have told me this sounds to 
them like it's going to be the most impressive Christmas record ever done, and 
that they'd like to get a personal copy not for their files, but for their 
enjoyment." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were plenty of disappointments, Vaus said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never heard back from Michael Jackson, we were rejected out of hand by 
Linda Ronstadt, and Kenny Rogers' people said no, too. They told us that at 
this point in Kenny's career, they felt his participation would lead to 
overexposure. I fail to see how 12,000 records, available only in San Diego, 
could lead to overexposure, but certainly they have a master plan for his 
career that makes sense to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We also lost a couple of artists we wanted to have because they're on Warner 
Bros. Records, the only major label that refused to cooperate. Emmylou Harris 
and Peter Cetera were each willing to contribute a previously recorded 
Christmas track they had done, but Warner Bros. has this corporate policy that 
doesn't allow anyone to use their masters." 
</P>
<P>
This year's benefit is the first, but hopefully not the last, Vaus said. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider this to be a pilot for future years," he said. "If we're as 
successful as I think we're going to be, I plan on doing this on an annual 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
His "ultimate dream," Vaus added, "is to make these albums available nationwide 
to raise money not just for the Children's Hospital in San Diego, but for all 
170 hospitals around the country that are part of what they call the Children's 
Miracle Network.

ITALIAN COMPANY MAKING UP FOR LOST HALF-CENTURY

Although France is considered the cradle of ballet, the cornerstones of 
classical dance were actually laid in Italy centuries before Louis XIV 
established the Royal Academy of Dancing in Paris in 1661. A basic manual 
written by Renaissance dance master Guglielmo Ebreo of Pesaro for the 
15th-Century Italian courts still serves as a valuable primer for today's 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Italian ballet has been almost dormant during the 20th Century. 
Italy's reputation as the mecca for opera notwithstanding, the last place that 
springs to mind for world-class ballet is the country of its origin. Italy's 
first serious ballet company -- Aterballetto -- did not even take root until 
1979, as the company's executive director, Roberto Giovanardi, acknowledged in 
a recent telephone interview from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was happening until this company started professional ballet. No one 
was doing ballet outside of the opera companies or the (ballet) schools. There 
was no permanent ballet company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Aterballetto's reputation in the international ballet world has 
grown by leaps and bounds. Dance Magazine proclaimed it "Italy's first national 
ballet." And when Clive Barnes reviewed the company's American debut in the New 
York Post four years ago, he observed that it clearly revealed "the first signs 
of another Italian renaissance." Nonetheless, the dance troupe has never 
performed in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, that fact was no deterrent to the San Diego Foundation for the Performing 
Arts, even after last year's disaster with "no-name" dance events. The local 
arts organization will begin its 1989-90 season with a pair of performances by 
Aterballetto at 8 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday at the Spreckels Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the foundation decide to stage another possibly risky event, after the 
poor response to last year's series nearly wiped out the organization? Founder 
Danah Fayman answered emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants somebody else to take a chance," she said. "That's always a 
problem. But before we decided, we called people who have presented them (in 
America). Their recommendations were all unqualified. They all said they wanted 
to bring Aterballetto back again, and the reviews have been good. You still 
never know how they're going to do here, of course. You have to go on 
instinct." 
</P>
<P>
The 22-member troupe, sponsored by the Assn. of Theaters of the Emilia Romagna 
region of northern Italy, was founded by Amedeo Amodio, who remains at the helm 
after 10 years, although he retired as a dancer five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Joffrey Ballet (to which the Aterballetto has been favorably compared 
by American critics), the company has an eclectic repertory that draws from the 
full spectrum of ballet styles. It also boasts a highly acclaimed group of 
dancers, with an average age of only 20. According to Aterballetto's publicity 
material, the company dances more than 130 concerts in Italy alone every year. 
</P>
<P>
Even in its homeland, however, Aterballetto is eclipsed by its sister arts, 
particularly the prestigious opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 10 years, there has been some growth in regional (ballet) 
companies, but the government spends its money first on the opera, then on 
drama and concerts, and if something remains, it goes to the ballet," 
Giovanardi noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Our income is around $2.5 million, but only about 10% comes from (government) 
support," he pointed out, adding that most of the rest of the income comes from 
performances. He said the opera receives a 90% subsidy and the symphony a 70% 
subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the economic shortfall from public funding, Aterballetto continues 
to make impressive strides and to aspire to even greater heights. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be a little company with big ballets," Giovanardi said with a 
laugh. "We want to fill the gap between the great ballets -- the 'Giselles' -- 
and the Pina Bausch and Jerome Robbins. Italy missed 50 years of ballet, and we 
want to make up for that." He said the company is trying to get "Fancy Free," 
the all-American masterpiece by Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years, Aterballetto had to import half of its dancers. Now, nearly 
all are home-grown. And the high standard of dancing in the troupe earns kudos, 
even in major dance centers. 
</P>
<P>
All but two of the seven works that will be performed in San Diego were 
choreographed by Amodio, who was trained in Italy and has worked with ballet 
greats like George Balanchine, Anthony Tudor and Glenn Tetley. His diverse 
repertory includes works by Alvin Ailey, Kenneth MacMillan and Margo 
Sappington. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe is expected to open its concert Tuesday with a sunny suite of dances 
by the celebrated Danish choreographer August Bournonville, staged for the 
company by his compatriot, Peter Schaufuss.

DOOBIES' ROCK IS JUST ALL RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reunite a famous '60s band, and all sorts of questions arise. 
</P>
<P>
Was it right for the Who, perhaps the best exemplar of that decade's fiery 
creativity, to come back for one last gravy run? 
</P>
<P>
Could the Jefferson Airplane, which fed off the cultural and generational 
schisms of the '60s, recapture their old passion, now that the times had 
a-changed? 
</P>
<P>
And how about the Rolling Stones? Are they back to write a new chapter in rock 
or just to cash in with one more collector's edition of a book everyone has 
read? 
</P>
<P>
But reunite a '70s band like the Doobie Brothers, and there's hardly a need to 
ask anything. 
</P>
<P>
The Doobies, like many of their high-profile '70s brethren, retreated from the 
'60s vision of rock as a cultural battlefield, or a burgeoning movement to be 
infused with high creative ideals. The Doobies, who took their name from a 
slang term for a marijuana cigarette, saw rock as a backing track for an 
easygoing good time. The one-time bar band from San Jose did not sing about how 
the storm was threatening their very life today or about people putting down 
their generation. 
</P>
<P>
No, the most telling line from the Doobies' signature song, "Listen to the 
Music," went like this: "What the people need is a way to make 'em smile / It 
ain't so hard to do if you know how." 
</P>
<P>
Given that limited vision, the reunited Doobie Brothers don't have to carry the 
extra-musical burdens under which the returning '60s vets have labored. The 
only question they had to answer Friday night at the Pacific Amphitheatre in 
Costa Mesa was the one common to all bar bands and nostalgia acts: Do they 
still have the skill and enthusiasm to breathe some momentary freshness into a 
batch of old favorites? 
</P>
<P>
The answer was good enough to get a few thousand nostalgic thirtysomething 
types up and dancing through much of Doobies' brisk, 1 1/2-hour set of tightly 
and faithfully rendered hits. Led by Patrick Simmons and Tom Johnston, the 
band's two founding singer-guitarists, the nine-man lineup capably reproduced 
the Doobie Brothers' distinctive high-wall-of-voices harmonies, rolling rhythms 
and commercially glossy synthesis of country, soul and rock 'n' roll roots. 
Simmons and Johnston both made the evening a rewarding one for guitar lovers, 
turning out plenty of melodic solos played with facility and bite. 
</P>
<P>
The Doobies did play six songs from their successful reunion album, "Cycles." 
But the new material hews to the band's old style, the Doobies having been 
sufficiently honest -- and market-savvy -- to stick with proven old ways, 
instead of trying to sound falsely "contemporary." Certain songs from "Cycles" 
convey a depth that the Doobie Brothers' early music lacked, a sense of life 
lived with struggles and disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons brought a feeling of troubled yearning to one of those songs, "Take Me 
to the Highway." Otherwise, it was pretty much good times as usual for the 
Doobies, a way to make the people smile. 
</P>
<P>
While the "Cycles" lineup is drawn from the Doobies' early-'70s incarnation 
that centered on Simmons and Johnston, with their country and down-home rock 
'n' roll influences, the show included a few songs from the later period marked 
by Michael McDonald's sophisticated white-soul style (McDonald, the only Doobie 
Brother who went on to solo success in the '80s, is not part of the reunion). 
</P>
<P>
Sidemen Cornelius Bumpus (a late-period Doobie) and Richard Bryant helped carry 
the McDonald songs off, but the Doobies were at their best with more rocking 
material, including feisty renditions of such chestnuts as "Rockin' Down the 
Highway," "Jesus Is Just Alright" and "Long Train Runnin.' " 
</P>
<P>
Simmons and Johnston had little to say in perfunctory song introductions, but 
they probably realized that their songs alone had enough to give the show a 
ready-made sense of connection and familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is the problem with rock nostalgia: The whole experience is 
ready made. Real excitement comes from watching a band, new or old, that still 
has the capacity to surprise itself and its audience. 
</P>
<P>
The Doobies can't be accused of playing by rote. But they were a band enjoying 
a smooth outing over a safe, old route, not one trying to find new scenery at 
some risk of getting lost. The Doobies' safe, familiar rock was just alright -- 
and that's about all.

LAGUNA EXHIBIT OF COUPLE'S WORKS SHOWS EXPRESSIONS OF 2 SINGULAR IMAGINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this rushed era of information overload, pop psychology and the ubiquitous 
sound bite, we are used to getting a handle on people by using ready-made 
categories -- yuppie, conservative, ethnic. 
</P>
<P>
In the infinitely subtle and highly personal world of art, however, labels are 
not much help. You don't get a grip on someone's work if all you know is that 
he or she is a conceptual artist or a Neo-Expressionist -- or a female or a 
black or a Latino artist. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, trying to come to terms with work by an "ethnic" artist has all sorts 
of pitfalls for the unwary. Using the ethnic label to stress the artist's 
"otherness," you may seem to imply that this person needs to be shielded from 
comparison with "mainstream" (i.e., male or white) artists. You may also be 
ignoring the delicate balance between "nature" and "nurture" in an artist's 
life. What if he or she was born into one culture but educated by another? 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you emphasize the artist's ties to the broader art 
community, you risk misunderstanding the heart and soul of the work -- 
including the conflict and isolation that often deeply color the lives of 
minority members of a society. 
</P>
<P>
These thoughts arise on the occasion of an exhibition of paintings by Carlos 
Almaraz and Elsa Flores, who are husband and wife, that runs through Nov. 7 at 
the Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna Beach. Almaraz, a leading 
member of the Southern California Latino art community, is a painter of 
phantasmagoric figurative scenes and landscapes alive with riotous color and 
light. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Mexico City in 1941 and grew up in Chicago and Southern 
California, where -- after living briefly in a rural Mexican-American village 
and in upscale West Los Angeles -- his parents eventually settled in the East 
Los Angeles barrio. His father, a laborer, was a fan of such American writers 
as Jack London and John Steinbeck. 
</P>
<P>
After studying life drawing in high school and attending several colleges, 
Almaraz moved to New York to check out the art scene. Unfortunately for his 
painterly exuberance, Minimalism was the style of the hour. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1971, at age 30, Almaraz returned to Los Angeles. After recovering from a 
severe illness and depression, he went back to the other side -- the culture of 
his heritage. With great gusto he entered the loop of Chicano artists, actors 
and social activists. He painted murals celebrating Chicano culture. He showed 
his work as a member of the proudly ethnic-identified Los Four group. 
</P>
<P>
But he also finally finished up his studies at Otis Art Institute (as the 
Otis/Parsons Art Institute in Los Angeles was then called), a bastion of the 
white art world. And, according to the catalogue from "Hispanic Art in the 
United States" -- the recent Los Angeles County Museum survey exhibition, in 
which he was represented -- by the late '70s he and his colleagues had 
"gradually detached" themselves from the Chicano art movement. 
</P>
<P>
Almaraz's present subject matter roams all over the map, snagging lush fantasy 
and everyday life with the same carousing imagination and skittering brush. 
</P>
<P>
In the painting "End of an Era," two generously endowed nude women holding 
parasols pass the time with an artist of indeterminate sex seated at his or her 
easel; a monkey watches, its tail sketched in with a serpentine lick of the 
brush. Everyone floats in groundless space that shades from oranges and yellows 
into blues and greens. Profiled heads -- a clown, a Greek god -- appear as if 
conjured up by dream-vision. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the "era" in question is the now distant-seeming time when art was a 
more clearly defined and broadly accessible enterprise -- when artists really 
did work from models, and when the myths and symbols artists drew upon were an 
integral part of the culture. (Traditionally, for example, monkeys were symbols 
of lasciviousness.) 
</P>
<P>
In a completely different mood, the painting "Remote Control" shows Almaraz 
using his powers of painterly exaggeration to find the hypnotic quality of the 
boob-tube experience. A splat! of paint snaps over the edge of the screen, as 
if transmitting energy from the remote control device held in the hand of a 
seated figure with a flat head. Big scribbles of Almaraz's brush block in the 
blinding glow of a lamp. Behind the TV set, a giant column rises -- maybe just 
a familiar piece of furniture eerily distorted, maybe an image symbolic of 
TV-viewing as idol worship. 
</P>
<P>
In a pastel drawing, "Suave Como la Noche," the artist takes yet another 
fruitful detour. By wildly exaggerating the colors of this street scene, he 
puts his finger on the eerie lushness of Southern California by night. Street 
lights beam triangular pools of green light, the moon is full and fuzzy, and 
orange tree trunks slice through the fuchsia sky. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Almaraz always hits the mark. In "Dunce's Dream," where he gives up 
his fancy-free brushwork for a cast of firmly outlined figures, he 
miscalculates. The cast of characters has a shopworn quality, and the tone 
seems ponderously allegorical. The viewer begins to suspect that what counts in 
Almaraz's work is not so much his ideas as his insight into moments of 
perception -- particularly involving light -- and his intense dedication to the 
physical activity of painting. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who is 14 years younger, was born in Las Vegas and studied at Cal State 
Los Angeles and at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. She paints in 
a broad-brushed style that looks, in large-scale compositions, rather unformed 
and unsure of itself, and whose scope is limited on a small scale. Yet the 
primal energy of the work reveals Flores' intense receptivity to the realms of 
dream and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
In "Dreamscape," a large, very loosely rendered work, vague figures wander in 
whirling, paint-spattered territory. Light from a house spreads out of a window 
like a solid object. A fiery, pop-eyed devil's head from her "Head Series" 
paintings bursts like a volcano with hot colors and spatters of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Who is to say what is specifically "Chicano" in these various approaches to 
painting, and what is not? Do these two artists come by their openness to 
fantasy, their love of color, their passion for light, their energetic brush 
styles from some cultural wellspring in their families' heritage? Or are these 
essentially personal choices, fed by exposure to art and religion and movies 
and literature and college psychology classes? 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the sources for art are so complex and diverse that the "labels" 
make little sense. In an era of well-intentioned surveys of "ethnic" art in its 
presumed context, it is a pleasure to see this work exhibited all by itself, 
with no special fanfare, simply as the products of two singular imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 Works by Carlos Almaraz and Elsa Flores are on view through Nov. 7 at the Art 
Institute of Southern California, 2222 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. 
Gallery hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

MISMANAGED BANKRUPTCY TASTES BITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You know what the biggest waste of space is? A busload of lawyers going off a 
1,000-foot cliff, and there are two vacant seats. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Murray 
</P>
<P>
Ask him, and Merrill Frank (Bob) Murray will tell you that everything negative 
that has ever been said or written about lawyers is true. 
</P>
<P>
If Murray's opinion of lawyers sounds harsh, it is understandable. He has been 
entangled in a legal morass for seven years, much of it created, he says, by a 
San Diego law firm he hired in a routine bankruptcy matter. Instead of helping 
him, a federal bankruptcy judge found, the firm of Jennings, Engstrand &amp; 
Henrikson worsened Murray's financial woes through its negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, 60, is a former heavy-equipment salesman from Santa Barbara who 
converted a small fortune from a 9-to-5 job and was able to retire in 1975, at 
age 46. Over the years, he invested his savings in income property and at one 
time was worth about $7 million, until his first wife divorced him in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired, the easy-going Murray owned a condominium in Hanalei, Hawaii, 
where he spent the winter, and commercial and residential buildings throughout 
California, including Carlsbad and Mira Mesa. Even after his divorce, Murray's 
fortune was estimated to be $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
But, in 1982, his financial world began to crumble. Rising interest rates 
forced him to seek protection from creditors, and Murray hired Jennings, 
Engstrand &amp; Henrikson, one of San Diego's oldest, largest and most 
prestigious firms, on the advice of a Santa Barbara lawyer. The move turned 
into a legal nightmare that continues to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what sold me to go there (Jennings). I was told they had their act 
together. Gosh, their act must have disintegrated the day before I walked in," 
Murray said. "My experience with them was similar to 'Alice in Wonderland.' 
Everything was incredibly backward. It cost me everything I had." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Murray wanted to stave off creditors, who held about $1.3 million in 
notes, long enough to obtain lower-interest loans to pay off his existing 
debts. Instead, Murray lost his entire fortune, including a 3.6-acre parcel in 
Carlsbad valued at $2 million, because of Jennings' ineptitude, said Murray's 
attorney, William Rathbone of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After losing everything he owned, Murray received a 223-page bill, about the 
size and thickness of a telephone directory, for $208,523.84 from Jennings. 
When Murray sued to avoid paying the bill, Jennings said the law firm would 
seek an additional $136,000, the amount it spent to defend itself against his 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The legal and financial problems were too overwhelming for Murray's wife, a 
Fulbright scholar who studied at UCSD and returned to her native Poland in 
August with the couple's 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and child admire Poland. Anybody that admires Poland, you know they 
had a bad time here," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, six years after the bankruptcy petition was filed, Murray filed his 
lawsuit over attorneys' fees against Jennings. His lawyer, Rathbone, explained 
to a bankruptcy judge in July, 1988, how Murray "could walk into the offices of 
Jennings, Engstrand &amp; Henrikson with $3.5 million worth of assets and now 
appear before this court . . . penniless and living below the poverty level." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Took 6 Months 
</P>
<P>
After a nearly monthlong trial, bankruptcy Judge John J. Hargrove took the 
matter under submission. Six months later, Hargrove released a 91-page written 
decision that supported Murray's argument and lambasted Jennings. The judge 
used words like "unethical conduct" and "numerous transgressions" to describe 
the law firm's performance in representing Murray and ruled that the firm did 
not deserve to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
The firm "failed to exercise the skill, care, prudence and diligence as other 
members of the legal profession commonly possess and exercise in bankruptcy 
matters," Hargrove said in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ruled that Jennings was not entitled to collect attorneys' fees 
because of negligence. Furthermore, Hargrove politely said that the firms' 
attorneys lied in their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"This court concludes that (Jennings) is not entitled to any attorneys' fees or 
costs . . . by virtue of its unethical conduct and numerous transgressions and 
omissions as previously discussed, reflected in its less than candid 
disclosures to the court and creditors of this estate," Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the judge ruled that Murray signed the promissory note for 
attorneys' fees under duress, and that Jennings misled him when the firm's 
attorneys told him that Hargrove did not need to review their fees. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Murray cleared another legal hurdle, when Superior Court Judge 
James R. Milliken allowed him to pursue a malpractice suit against Jennings in 
Superior Court. Milliken denied a motion by Jennings to dismiss the lawsuit. 
Murray said he hopes to recover the money he lost through Jennings' negligence 
"plus some interest and other damages." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Appealed 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jennings has appealed Hargrove's decision. The firm's attorneys, and 
those who represented Murray in the bankruptcy matter but who no longer work at 
Jennings, declined to comment. Manny Ramos, who is representing the firm in the 
appeal, issued a brief statement: 
</P>
<P>
"We respectfully disagree with the decision. It's on appeal. Because of ongoing 
litigation, we do not think it is appropriate to discuss the case." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his financial downfall, Murray remains indefatigable in his attempt to 
"right the wrong that lawyers have done to me." The quest has turned into an 
obsession for a man who was once a self-made millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
During the bankruptcy trial, Jennings' lawyers attempted to portray Murray as a 
sophisticated businessman who was knowledgeable about complex real estate 
matters. They argued that Murray was largely to blame for his financial 
hardships. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge found otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Murray was not a sophisticated owner and operator of real estate," Hargrove 
wrote, "but rather a retired salesman of heavy equipment who had accumulated 
some real estate assets for his retirement but had never . . . been involved in 
a complex real estate transaction." 
</P>
<P>
Before losing his fortune, Murray lived a well-to-do retiree's life in Del Mar, 
vacationing in Europe and the Far East, and driving a treasured Austin Healy 
about town. Today, he lives in a duplex in Oceanside, where he makes a living 
by renting out 20 refrigerators for $30 a month each, and by working part-time 
for a telephone soliciting company. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were born with silver spoons in their mouths. I was born with a 
do-it-yourself kit," he says proudly. "But let me tell you, your life style 
changes when you lose your money. When that happens, you're lucky to go from 
Oceanside to downtown San Diego. It makes you humble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of Attorney 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his living room, Murray waved a copy of Hargrove's decision and told 
a visitor that it is a biographical sketch of his last seven years. Throughout 
the document, the judge criticized attorney Jack Cohen, who formerly worked at 
Jennings and handled Murray's bankruptcy, and the law firm for hiding numerous 
transactions from the court and "misleading" the court. 
</P>
<P>
"This court concludes that attorney Cohen's comments to the court . . . as to 
the status of the estates, were materially misleading and his statements 
regarding the fact that Murray had obtained financing were false," Hargrove 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith McWilliams, Cohen's supervisor at Jennings, also came in for criticism 
from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"Further, this court finds that attorney Williams did not adequately supervise 
attorney Cohen in his handling of these proceedings and that this is a 
substantial cause of the problems which occurred in the case," Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen declined to comment, telling a reporter that he did not wish "to try this 
case in the press." McWilliams, after initially agreeing to an interview, had a 
secretary call and cancel. A request for another interview was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Among the "transgressions" committed by Cohen and Jennings, according to 
Hargrove's decision, were: 
</P>
<P>
* Failure to obtain court approval before hiring three additional law firms to 
work on the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
* Pressuring Murray to accept a $70,000 bill from one outside attorney, who 
presented him with a one-page statement that contained no details about what he 
did to earn the fee. Jennings also directed Murray to sign a promissory note to 
a Santa Barbara attorney for $38,500 and $4,920 for the attorney's firm. 
</P>
<P>
* Opening a secret joint checking account at Bank of America under the name of 
Murray and former Jennings attorney McWilliams. The account was used to pay 
some creditors and provide living expenses for Murray without court approval. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowing Murray to obtain several additional loans, further burdening his 
liabilities, without obtaining court approval while going through bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
* Employing Coldwell Banker real estate to handle the sale of Murray's Carlsbad 
property without getting authorization from the court. Jennings prepared 
documents that included a provision that caused Murray to personally guarantee 
a $120,000 commission to Coldwell Banker. 
</P>
<P>
* Employing an attorney to protect Murray's interest in Hawaii without court 
approval. Murray said the attorney was supposed to save his condominium, but he 
lost the house. According to Hargrove's decision, Murray also ended up with a 
$21,000 judgment filed against him by the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Numerous Transgressions' 
</P>
<P>
In his decision, Hargrove noted Jennings' "repeated violations of various 
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules." The judge concluded 
that "the record in this case does not reflect an isolated incident or two of 
inattention or omission by (Jennings) . . . but rather a systematic pattern of 
numerous transgressions beginning in late 1983." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon L. Gerson, an experienced San Diego bankruptcy lawyer, said Murray's 
case "is neither common nor uncommon." 
</P>
<P>
"A case of this magnitude is about as frequent as Hurricane Hugo coming through 
town," Gerson said. "I don't think the bankruptcy court system should be judged 
by this case. There's nothing wrong with the system that's not already being 
addressed or continually reviewed by local bankruptcy judges or the bankruptcy 
bar." 
</P>
<P>
According to Gerson, beginning this week new rules will take effect in local 
bankruptcy court that will require attorneys to list separately the fee charged 
clients for each legal matter and explain what they did to earn the fee. In 
addition, attorneys will be required to file quarterly fee applications with 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
"These are examples of how the bankruptcy system is trying to take care of its 
own problems," Gerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerson said he was surprised by Jennings' performance in Murray's case because 
"they are good lawyers." "Jennings is an excellent law firm. I think that 
bankruptcy lawyers at Jennings today and in the past generally have been 
excellent lawyers," he added. 
</P>
<P>
His observation was echoed by Hargrove, who was perplexed by the way Jennings 
handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
"What is most disturbing is that some of the members at (Jennings) who handled 
this proceeding are exceptionally experienced in bankruptcy proceedings . . . 
Supervising attorney McWilliams was a former bankruptcy judge and is very 
experienced in bankruptcy matters," Hargrove said in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Jennings attorneys contradicted each other's testimony, and 
even an expert witness hired by the firm to further its case inadvertently 
helped Murray's case instead. These contradictions were noted by Hargrove in 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen testified that Murray contributed to his financial demise by repeatedly 
refusing to follow his legal advice. To buttress this testimony, Cohen 
testified that he had trouble communicating with Murray. However, Hargrove 
noted that Michael Van Horne, who also worked at Jennings, testified that 
"Murray was somewhat of a pest who showed up frequently at the offices of 
(Jennings) without appointments." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Robert G. Sullivan, who was hired by Jennings to testify as an expert 
in a complex real estate deal arranged by the firm to sell Murray's Carlsbad 
property, ended up supporting Murray's position. 
</P>
<P>
In drawing up the real estate documents, Jennings allowed the buyer to take 
about $250,000 out of escrow in April, 1984. Under questioning by Rathbone, 
Murray's attorney, Sullivan, testified that it was "unusual" for a buyer to 
take money out of escrow and added that the bankruptcy court "would have been 
interested" in reviewing the sale arranged by Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, Hargrove wrote that the law firm had "given away" the estimated 
$250,000. Jennings "also caused the estate to lose approximately $62,500 in 
interest" and "waived" a $30,000 extension in its handling of the sale of the 
Carlsbad property, Hargrove wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Court Authorization 
</P>
<P>
It was Jennings' handling of Murray's Carlsbad property, 3.6 undeveloped acres 
that represented his major asset, that was singled out for most of the 
criticism by Hargrove. At the time, the land was appraised at $2 million. In 
the end, Property Mortgage, a Beverly Hills company, foreclosed and ended up 
with the property, paying only $950,000 for it in a sale that was completed 
without authorization from the court. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the major asset in the estate and in the absence of a disclosure 
statement and plan the bankruptcy court would have been required to carefully 
scrutinize the terms of the sale. . . . (Jennings) deprived this court and the 
creditors the opportunity to review the transaction, which obviously provided 
substantial greater risk to the estate," Hargrove wrote in his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Murray was left with a $120,000 debt to Coldwell Banker and a $65,000 judgment 
from a sanitation company that was renting part of his Carlsbad property. 
"That's what I got from the sale. That's what I got from the $2 million the 
property was worth," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
His bankruptcy experience has left him with bitter feelings about lawyers, 
Murray said. Attorneys, he added, are allowed to stand above the law. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge's decision says that the lawyers broke the law," he said. "They 
didn't abide by the bankruptcy laws, but nobody went to jail. I can't believe 
it. Can this happen in America?"

GUNMAN WOUNDED BY OFFICER IN 1 OF 3 SOUTHEAST SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three separate shootings in Southeast San Diego early Sunday left three men 
hospitalized and one of them under arrest for attempted murder, San Diego 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence W. Jarman, 70, was wounded by Police Officer C. Andrew Hoffman, 25, 
after Jarman allegedly pointed a gun at the officer, who was trying to break up 
a dispute between two other men outside Jarman's house in the 2900 block of 
Imperial Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman fired several shots at Jarman, who was standing behind a screen door in 
his house, police said. The elderly man reportedly fired at least one shot back 
at the officer. 
</P>
<P>
After Jarman retreated into his house, a SWAT team was called in. SWAT officers 
made contact with Jarman by telephone and persuaded him to surrender. A search 
of the home uncovered a loaded revolver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jarman was wounded in the leg and foot, and was taken to UC San Diego Medical 
Center. He was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated shooting, Edmond White, 31, was wounded in the back while he 
and some friends were drinking beer on the sidewalk at Greenlawn and Skyline 
drives. Police said a gunman drove up, got out of his car and shot at the 
group, hitting White. 
</P>
<P>
White was taken to Mercy Hospital, where he was reported in serious but stable 
condition late Sunday. Police are seeking the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
In the third shooting, John Rodgers, 25, was shot in the buttocks after a man 
wearing a red bandanna over his face and carrying a chrome-plated revolver 
approached a group of people in the 1300 block of South 45th Street.

TWO BODIES FOUND IN LEUCADIA HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies called to a Leucadia home Sunday morning made a gruesome 
discovery. The decomposing bodies of two family members were found in separate 
parts of the home on Eolus Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The county coroner's office identified the dead as John Michael Flagg, 46, and 
his mother, Sybil Flagg. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Sgt. Chuck Curtis said the two may have been dead for more than a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident of the home, Sally Flagg, sister and daughter of the deceased, 
told homicide detectives that her brother had come home drunk earlier Sunday 
and had tried to break into her room. She was being held for questioning.

<P>
A bill that would require the state Public Utilities Commission to perform an 
environmental impact report on the proposed merger of Southern California 
Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric was vetoed Sunday by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he was killing the measure by Sen. Wadie A. Deddeh (D-Bonita) 
because it was unnecessary. He said the PUC has already recognized that the 
merger needs to be subject to an environmental study, and preparations are 
under way for that review. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Deukmejian noted that the PUC has designated both the City and 
County of San Diego, avowed opponents of the merger, as two of the governmental 
agencies that will be asked to help draft the report. 
</P>
<P>
Enacting Deddeh's bill, the governor said, would "introduce uncertainty and 
confusion into the ongoing (environmental study) preparation process."

A Burbank teen-ager was killed early Sunday when the car he was driving hit an 
oncoming vehicle and overturned, Burbank police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Pat Lynch said Jaime Garcia, 17, died of injuries sustained in the 1 a.m. 
crash on Victory Place just north of Burbank Boulevard. 
</P>

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD IN ARSON OF KAGEL CANYON HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was arrested Sunday on suspicion of setting fire to the home of an 
acquaintance who refused to lend him money, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Douglas Howell, 36, a transient 
from Tacoma, Wash., in the arson of a Kagel Canyon home rented by Robert 
Cawley, said Sgt. Stephen Keife. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out about 4:30 a.m., caused an estimated $102,000 damage 
to the house in the 11300 block of Rayland Drive, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Keife said Howell came to the home earlier that morning and demanded that 
Cawley give him $1,400 so Howell could pay a debt. When Cawley refused, the two 
began arguing. 
</P>
<P>
Howell hit Cawley and threatened to destroy his house with dynamite, Keife 
said. A friend of Cawley's who saw the fight took Cawley away to prevent more 
violence, Keife said. When Cawley returned home, he found it in flames. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters about four hours to control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours after the fire was extinguished, Cawley saw Howell walking on 
Kagel Canyon Road, two miles from the house. Sheriff's deputies arrested Howell 
about 10:45 a.m. He was in custody Sunday afternoon at the Cresenta Valley 
Sheriff's station in lieu of $10,000 bail.

18 CLERKS SNARED IN LIQUOR-SALES STING USING UNDERAGE OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police cited 18 North Hollywood store clerks for selling beer to a 
minor during a weekend sting operation aimed at cracking down on 
alcohol-related problems, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Brad Merritt said the undercover operation made use of a 19-year-old 
reserve officer working with the vice squad from the Police Department's North 
Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
Officers checked 50 outlets, including liquor stores, mini-marts and gas 
stations that sell alcohol, to see if clerks would sell a six-pack of beer to 
the underage officer, Merritt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran a similar operation last February and that operation had a 66% sales 
rate," Merritt said. "Tonight, it came out to 36%, so there's been a decrease 
of about one-third." 
</P>
<P>
Merritt credited the decline to the widespread publicity of earlier sting 
operations and to meetings with store owners on liquor sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
In the February sting, only about one-third of the clerks asked an obviously 
underage customer for identification, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, however, about two-thirds of the clerks checked for proof of age. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a case tonight where they asked for his ID, checked it and then turned 
around and sold it to him anyway," Merritt said. He said the incident took 
place at a gas station store. 
</P>
<P>
The sting involved the teen-ager taking a six-pack of beer to a cashier, 
placing it on the counter and waiting to see what the clerk would do. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the locations we hit we had cited in February," Merritt said. "Some of 
them sold again, some of them didn't. Some of them learned their lesson and 
some didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Police checked liquor outlets in an area bounded by San Fernando Road on the 
north, Ventura Boulevard on the south, Coldwater Canyon on the west and 
Cahuenga Boulevard on the east between 7 p.m. Saturday and 1:30 a.m. Sunday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Store owners face fines or suspension or revocation of their licenses to sell 
alcohol.

UTAH GAME EASY TO LOOK BACK ON FOR AZTECS' LUGINBILL 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After rehashing non-winning football games for three previous Sundays, San 
Diego State Coach Al Luginbill was finally given a chance to discuss a 
successful effort -- a 38-27 defeat of Utah Saturday night, featuring a 
510-yard passing performance by quarterback Dan McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
It was Luginbill's first victory as a major college coach. But instead of 
talking about personal achievement, Luginbill seemed relieved that his team's 
hard work had finally translated into a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not into personal things too much, I'm more concerned with the team," 
Luginbill said. "We were improving every week, but we had nothing to show for 
it. I was hoping that the improvement would eventually equate to wins. I was 
also pleased that the team remembered the fight song after the game." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill seemed even more pleased with an improved running game that netted 
149 yards in 49 carries against Utah. Darrin Wagner, a redshirt freshman from 
Lincoln High, ran especially well, gaining 97 yards in 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be difficult to defend because of the run," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
But Luginbill could not help but note the importance of the forward pass and 
praise the performance by McGwire, the fourth-best passing day in Aztec 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's gotten better every week," Luginbill said. "But he can still 
improve. That's what makes this offense scary." 
</P>
<P>
The defense also showed signs of becoming a bit more frightening, particularly 
to opposing quarterbacks. They eclipsed their yearly sack total by two with 
seven of Utah quarterback Scott Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense came up with the big play when we had to," Luginbill said. "Our 
600 yards would have gone right down the drain if we didn't play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Nickel back John Wessleman, who had 16 tackles, came up with the biggest play 
of the game when he intercepted a Mitchell pass late in the fourth quarter with 
Utah trailing, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few negatives Luginbill detected was the Aztecs' continuing problem 
with penalties. After being flagged 13 times for 135 yards, San Diego State is 
averaging 9.5 penalties and 83 yards a game to its opponents' 5.5 and 39.5. 
</P>
<P>
One of those 13 penalties was an unsportsmanlike foul on Luginbill for 
insisting on a pass interference call that never came. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong because I went on the field to question it," Luginbill said. 
"There's no excuse for it, but (the official) was ready for me. He damn near 
hit me in the face with the flag." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill also defended his decision to go for a first down on fourth and one 
inch from his own 15 late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't make one inch, you're not a very physical football team," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were never given a chance to show how physical they were. They 
jumped offsides, which forced Luginbill to call in the punting team. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Monty Gilbreath became SDSU's all-time leader in all-purpose 
yards with 3,658, passing Chris Hardy. With seven receptions for 142 yards, he 
also passed Cleveland Browns receiver Webster Slaughter on the all-time yardage 
list, moving into ninth place with 1,700. . . . Wide receiver Dennis Arey 
pulled a hamstring early in the game, and his status will be reviewed 
throughout the week. . . . Freshman kicker Andy Trakas, who missed two of three 
field goals, was replaced on kickoffs by senior Tom Wurth in the second half. 
Luginbill said the kicking and kickoff jobs will be decided during the week.

Off the coast of Santa Barbara sit three oil platforms, part of a 10-year-old, 
$2-billion investment in California's energy future. In all that time, they 
have yet to produce a drop of oil -- and it's anyone's guess when they will. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Chevron Corp. and a consortium of oil companies paid more than $500 
million for the rights to develop the Point Arguello field, an undersea 
reservoir of oil and gas estimated at between 300 million to 500 million 
barrels. It is one of the most significant finds since the vast North Slope 
field in Alaska, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The companies already have built three platforms, 26 miles of pipelines and 
sizeable onshore facilities. But regulatory, environmental and community 
challenges have kept the project on hold, consuming $500,000 a day in interest 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the California Coastal Commission handed the project its latest 
setback, denying a request to use tankers to transport crude to onshore 
processing plants, arguing that Chevron had not sufficiently explored the use 
of environmentally safer pipelines. 
</P>

"We've been after this thing for 10 years now, and we may well be another year 
away from doing it. . . . To say it's difficult is an understatement," said 
Richard J. Harris, general manager of the Western region land department for 
Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Forces 
</P>
<P>
The project exemplifies two forces in California: those that want to develop 
the state's energy supplies and those that want to control that development. As 
California relies increasingly on dwindling energy reserves both at home and in 
Alaska, those forces will come more into conflict, exacerbated by the state's 
energy isolation from the rest of the country, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be a big contradiction or clash between the economic public 
good and the environmental public good, and it will be more pronounced in 
California than anywhere else in the world," said Fereidun Fesharaki, head of 
the energy program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, a nonprofit research 
center funded by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
For the average consumer, the long-term outlook could mean either limited 
supply, higher prices, or both. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be worse off than the rest of the country in that respect," 
said H. D. Maxwell, president of Unocal Corp.'s oil and gas division. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, California is a unique and isolated energy market. It is defined 
on the north and east by mountain ranges and on the west by the Pacific. No 
major pipelines bring crude or refined products into the state from other parts 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Any outside oil -- even from the Gulf of Mexico -- must come in by tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there are only a couple of major pipelines bringing natural gas into 
the state, mainly from the Southwest, though several projects have been 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
None of which has mattered much recently. California exports oil to other parts 
of the country. It ranks fourth among the states in oil production, second in 
production from the outer continental shelf, according to state estimates. It 
is practically the sole source of refined product for Arizona and Nevada, 
according to the California Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But the state's comfortable supply situation may change in the long run. For 
one thing, California remains increasingly dependent on just two sources of 
oil: its own fields and those on the North Slope of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
California can handle short-term disruptions in supply, such as the Exxon 
Valdez oil spill in March, although such interruptions mean higher prices. 
"There's enough elasticity in the world petroleum market and on the spot market 
that shortages could be made up over a short period of time," said Charles R. 
Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission. The commission has put 
together a detailed plan to meet such contingencies, ranging all the way up to 
a major disaster that shuts off the Alaskan spigot entirely. 
</P>
<P>
But in the long term, "I certainly have to say that over the next 20 years, we 
face the dilemma of having to depend on foreign imports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important factor is the decline of the Alaska reservoir, which 
provided 43.2% of the 708.8 million barrels of crude received by state 
refineries in 1988, according to Energy Commission figures. The rest was 
supplied by state fields, 51.5%, and foreign imports mainly from Indonesia, 
about 5.2%. In the first half of 1989, Alaska accounted for 46.8% of California 
refinery crude. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Decline 
</P>
<P>
Production of oil, natural gas and condensates from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay fields 
began to decline in 1988 from a peak of 1.6 million barrels per day, with this 
year's production expected to amount to only 1.4 million barrels, said Albert 
Greenstein, a spokesman for Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This year's sharp decline is unusual and partly attributable to warmer weather 
and the Exxon spill, both of which reduced production. But Greenstein said Arco 
expects Alaskan production to continue to fall at an average annual rate of 4% 
to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
State reserves remain promising, both offshore and inland, particularly from 
the century-old fields in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
But development of those resources may be restricted by a number of things. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality restrictions are limiting the amount that oil companies can expand 
plants to generate the steam necessary to extract thick oil from Kern County 
fields. The restrictions also require the plants to burn more natural gas to 
generate the steam. 
</P>
<P>
But natural gas needed by these so-called enhanced oil recovery projects is 
limited by available pipeline capacity. A number of competing pipelines are now 
vying for approvals and customers to bring such gas into Kern County from 
Canada, the Southwest and the Rocky Mountains, but none has been built. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to develop offshore oil reserves have been stymied in the wake of the 
disastrous Valdez spill. Eleven new offshore platforms and six man-made islands 
are proposed or under construction in state and federal waters offshore, to be 
added to the current 29, according to the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But in July, Congress passed two versions of a one-year moratorium on drilling 
off most areas of the U.S. coast. A moratorium would postpone until at least 
October, 1990, any pre-lease activity on proposed lease sales off the 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Due Soon 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium could affect the proposed sales of three major lease areas: 
Lease Sale 91 off Northern California, scheduled this month; Lease Sale 95 off 
Southern California, scheduled for April, 1990, and Lease Sale 119 off Central 
California, proposed for March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Bush indefinitely postponed the leasing of 91 and 95 while a 
task force studied environmental issues. The task force is scheduled to make 
its report by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the California Coastal Commission has voted its objections to the 
three lease sales, citing what it considers unacceptable risks of oil spills, 
air pollution, visual blight and conflicts with the fishing and tourism 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the commission estimates that total production in the Santa 
Barbara Channel and the Santa Maria Basin, the most productive areas of the 
outer continental shelf off Southern California, could peak in 1999 at 247,600 
barrels of oil per day. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes the need for environmental care, particularly given 
California's smog problems and the destruction from the Exxon oil spill. But 
that doesn't lessen the frustration of executives such as Maxwell. "I'm not 
implying that we shouldn't do these things, but the result will be a lower 
supply of California crude and a greater dependence on imported crude," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, environmentalists and others argue that the simple solution is to 
reduce demand. "I think the issue here is one of looking at both the demand 
side as well as the supply side issues," said David Goldstein, senior staff 
scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council's San Francisco office. 
"If there's a restriction on refinery construction, that means either you've 
got to build more refineries (somewhere else), or reduce demand to the 
capability of existing ones . . . and from an economic viewpoint, it's easier 
to reduce demand than to increase supply." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, demand for refined products in California continues to 
increase, rising to 565.8 million barrels in 1988 from 502.1 million in 1984, 
the Energy Commission reported. Yet it's been nearly 20 years since the last 
refinery was built in California. 
</P>
<P>
Squeezed margins prompted refiners here and around the country to close 
marginally efficient refineries in the early 1980s -- removing about 13% of the 
state's refining capacity, according to one estimate. California ranked second 
in refining capacity among the states in 1988, accounting for about 16% of 
total capacity, according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
Tighter state and federal emissions regulations and increasing demand for 
higher grades of gasoline meant that refineries needed more crude to produce 
the same volume of gasoline. Refiners were able to keep up by increasing plant 
efficiency and "debottlenecking" operations. 
</P>
<P>
But as prices fell and demand increased, refineries found the need to run at 
much higher rates, many over 90% for much of this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is little incentive to build new refineries. It would cost about 
$2 billion to build a new 235,000-barrel-per-day refinery in California -- and 
that's provided a refiner could get the necessary permits, hardly a sure thing 
in an era of increased environmental awareness. 
</P>
<P>
If there were to be a major disruption in the supply of gasoline or refined 
product, they would have to be imported by tanker -- there are no major 
pipelines to bring such products into the state. 
</P>
<P>
That could take weeks to arrange. Among other things, gasolines would have to 
meet California's strict emissions standards. 
</P>
<P>
All of which could mean a sharp spike in prices, as evidenced by the fallout 
from the Exxon Valdez spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk Increases 
</P>
<P>
The tightness of the market was again demonstrated by a fire last month at a 
Shell Oil Co. refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area, which caused prices for 
future gasoline contracts to jump more than a penny a gallon in one day. 
</P>
<P>
The surprising thing about the Shell fire was not that it occurred, but that it 
hadn't occurred sooner or in a bigger way, observers said. "Obviously, with 
mechanical equipment, there is some greater risk whenever the equipment is 
pushed harder," said Robert Cunningham, a vice president with the Dallas 
consulting firm of Turner, Mason &amp; Co. "If you drive your automobile across 
country at high speed, rather than just across Los Angeles, you have a greater 
chance of mechanical breakdown, particularly if you're doing it for hours in a 
row," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You add those things up, and it adds up to tighter product availability and 
higher prices, and the only thing that can overcome the (problem) is the 
incentive to make the investment to make the product available -- which again 
means higher prices . . . or building capacity overseas," said Dennis Lamb, a 
manager of planning at Unocal. "We're virtually being forced offshore," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fundamental contradiction in California's approach to (energy) 
problems," said Richard Gordon, director of market analysis with the Petroleum 
Finance Co. Ltd. in Washington. "They are simultaneously restricting supply -- 
and that's what's happening, whether you're talking about restrictions on 
refiners or delays in bringing supply into the market. . . . At the same time, 
though, there are a number of key factors -- growth in California, 
demographics, economic demand -- saying we need more supply. . . . That's not a 
sustainable situation."

STAKING THEIR NAMES ON IT;

<P>
MANY WELL-KNOWN LOCAL FIRMS HAVE KEPT A LINK WITH THEIR FOUNDERS AS PART OF 
THEIR IDENTITY.

<P>
You can tell a lot about a place by knowing a little about the people who 
started the best-known businesses there. The knowledge tells you, for instance, 
what it has taken to succeed and survive in the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Southern California is sometimes accused of having a short memory 
about its past, not all its businesses have been flashes in the pan. In fact, 
it has no shortage of long-established, successful companies. 
</P>
<P>
So, examine a measure of local immortality -- people whose names are still 
attached to the companies that they founded here and whose corporate legacies 
include widespread name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Who were they? Not unlike many of today's Southland entrepreneurs, they were 
often immigrants who came here flat broke. Most commonly, they were fortune 
seekers, dreamers and unorthodox risk takers. And, also not unlike today, they 
sought some imaginative way to tap this rich market. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a little background on some of the region's most venerable names in 
business. The ground rules for inclusion were that the companies must be 
Southern California-based, that they were founded here, still carry their 
founders' names and have been around for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
This list is not exhaustive. It also leaves out local companies that were 
founded elsewhere, have moved away, were started in the recent past, dropped or 
never used their founders' names, do not have high name recognition or no 
longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
There are many, many companies in those categories, but sic transit gloria. 
</P>
<P>
MARK C. BLOOME CO. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim-based tire retailer, now owned by Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. 
</P>
<P>
Mark C. Bloome (1902-), after emigrating from Canada to Southern California, 
opened a gas station in 1924 on Slauson Avenue in Compton. Using razzle-dazzle 
promotions -- among them glassware giveaways and woman attendants on roller 
skates -- he built his business into a chain of service stations across Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, under the guidance of his son-in-law Jerry Fields, Bloome's 
stations gradually began to specialize in selling tires. The chain pioneered 
the concept of the large, clean tire store selling all major brands, with 
service bays facing the street and air-conditioned waiting rooms. The family 
sold the business to Petrolane Inc. in 1972; Goodyear purchased it in 1986. It 
currently operates 45 stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
BULLOCK'S 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based department store chain, now a unit of R. H. Macy Co. 
</P>
<P>
John G. Bullock (1871-1933), born in Canada, founded his Los Angeles department 
store in 1907 at Seventh and Broadway, with financial backing of his former 
boss Arthur Letts, owner of the Broadway Department Store down the street. 
Later, he bought out Letts' interest and expanded his chain to several stores, 
each operated independently. In 1970, after their purchase by Federated 
Department Stores, the Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire chains were made into 
separate entities. (Bullocks Wilshire dropped the apostrophe in its name as 
part of its effort to establish its own identity.) Both chains were purchased 
by Macy in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
MARIE CALLENDER PIE SHOPS INC. 
</P>
<P>
Orange-based chain of coffee shops, now owned by Wilshire Restaurant Group. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Callender (1907-), with husband Cal and son Don, began making pies in a 
rented Quonset hut in Long Beach in 1948, then selling them wholesale to coffee 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, the Callenders began opening their own restaurants, 
specializing in such basic fare as soup, chili, sandwiches, pie and coffee. The 
family sold the business, which has grown to 153 restaurants in 16 states, to 
Ramada Inns in 1986, which sold it in May of this year to Wilshire Restaurant 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
WALT DISNEY CO. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank-based entertainment and theme park company. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Elias Disney (1901-1966), a one-time Missouri farm boy with a talent for 
drawing, moved to Southern California in the 1920s and began making animated 
cartoons in a Hollywood garage. Despite early setbacks, he hit it big with 
Mickey Mouse and built a billion-dollar entertainment empire. 
</P>
<P>
After his death, the company stagnated and was almost taken over by a corporate 
raider. But, under new management, it has become a hugely profitable 
entertainment conglomerate in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach-based aircraft builder, now part of McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Wills Douglas (1892-1981), a pioneer aircraft engineer, moved to Los 
Angeles and founded his own airplane company in 1920 in a back room behind a 
Santa Monica barbershop. A decade later, Douglas developed the DC (for Douglas 
Commercial) series of aircraft, which accounted for more than half of the 
world's airline seats until the end of the 1950s, by which time Boeing's wildly 
successful 707 had ushered in the jet age and taken away Douglas's lead in 
commercial airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The company's delay in entering the jetliner market hastened its merger with 
McDonnell in 1967. Douglas stepped down as chief executive that year at age 75. 
</P>
<P>
DUCOMMUN INC. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based aerospace manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes called the state's oldest company, it began in 1849 when Swiss 
watchmaker Charles Louis Ducommun (1820-1896) set up a watch shop that became a 
general store near the center of the pueblo of Los Angeles. Early in the 20th 
Century, Ducommun's heirs diversified by becoming suppliers to the area's 
fledging aircraft manufacturing industry. Ducommun family members still occupy 
key executive positions, but in recent years the company has hit hard times, 
including four straight years of losses. 
</P>
<P>
EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based maker of wheelchairs and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert A. Everest, paralyzed in a mining accident, needed a wheelchair, but 
those used in the 1930s were made of rigid wood and wicker. They didn't fit in 
a car, so Everest and his friend Harry C. Jennings (1888-1964), also a mining 
engineer, puttered in a West Los Angeles garage and came up with a folding 
wheelchair made of lightweight aircraft tubing and fabric. From that beginning 
has grown the world's largest wheelchair manufacturer, with annual sales of 
$191 million. 
</P>
<P>
FLUOR CORP. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine-based engineering and construction company. 
</P>
<P>
John Simon Fluor (1867-1944), a Swiss immigrant who, in the 1890s, worked with 
his brothers in the construction business in Oshkosh, Wis., moved to Santa Ana 
in 1912 and founded Fluor Construction Co. In 1915, the company got its first 
oil and gas construction contract, which led eventually to mammoth refineries 
and other energy industry projects. Fluor remained active in his company until 
he died, and his heirs and relatives still fill a number of key positions at 
the publicly traded, $5-billion firm. 
</P>
<P>
HUGHES AIRCRAFT 
</P>
<P>
Culver City-based defense and electronics firm, now a unit of General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known exactly when, but in the early 1930s -- not long after the 
brilliant, eccentric Howard Robard Hughes (1905-1976) purchased the RKO movie 
studio and began to spend considerable time in Southern California -- Hughes 
formed an aircraft division of his Houston-based Hughes Tool Co. In essence, it 
was a bookkeeping entity to pay for the experimental racing planes that he 
built and housed at Glendale airport. 
</P>
<P>
In 1941, he moved Hughes Aircraft to Culver City, where it developed aircraft 
with non-metallic "skins" -- culminating in the gigantic Spruce Goose. After 
World War II, Hughes steered the company into defense electronics and 
eventually communications satellites. In 1953, it was made a separate corporate 
entity whose profits went to the charitable Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 
and in 1985, it was sold to GM. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE CO. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach-based land developer. 
</P>
<P>
James Irvine (1867-1947), son of a San Francisco merchant-turned-Orange County 
sheep rancher, took his father's share of a huge Orange County ranch and built 
it into an agricultural giant, raising mostly beans and sugar beets. Under his 
sons and granddaughter in the 1950s and later, the company began to develop the 
land as Orange County became a major population center. The family's foundation 
sold the company to a group of investors, including Donald Bren, in 1977. Bren 
now has a controlling stake and serves as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
LAWRY'S FOODS INC. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based specialty foods and restaurants company, now owned by Thomas 
J. Lipton Co. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence L. Frank (1887- 1970), after a successful career with his 
brother-in-law in the Van de Kamp's bakery business, incorporated his own 
company -- using his nickname -- to operate restaurants and similar businesses. 
The centerpiece was Lawry's The Prime Rib, which has become a fixture on La 
Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, he began selling his own brand of blended seasoning salt to Lawry's 
The Prime Rib customers; that modest beginning has grown into a $200-million 
food products business that includes Lawry's California Center, a sprawling 
manufacturing and restaurant operation near downtown Los Angeles. Lipton, the 
tea maker, has owned Lawry's since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
LITTON INDUSTRIES 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
Charles V. Litton (1903-1972), owner of an electron tube company in Northern 
California, sold his firm in 1953 to conglomerate builder Charles (Tex) 
Thornton, who merged it with his fledgling Electro-Dynamics Corp. in Southern 
California. Litton's name was attached to the combined firms in 1954 because of 
the good reputation that his products enjoyed among brass at the Pentagon, the 
company's major customer. Litton never worked for the $5-billion, Beverly 
Hills-based company that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
LOCKHEED CORP. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas-based defense, aircraft and electronics firm. 
</P>
<P>
Barnstormers and flight pioneers Allan Haines Loughead (1889-1969) and his 
brother Malcolm struck it rich giving aerial sightseeing tours at an exposition 
in San Francisco in 1915. His efforts to start an aircraft factory were mostly 
failures, however, and only a rescue by a group of investors in 1932 kept 
Lockheed Aircraft Corp., which he started in 1926 and sold in 1929, from going 
under. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which now generates revenue of more than $10 billion annually, has 
used the phonetic spelling of Loughead's name since its founding to avoid 
unfortunate mispronunciations, such as "lug-hed." Allan legally changed the 
spelling of his name to Lockheed in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER PICTURES 
</P>
<P>
Culver City-based movie and television producer, now part of MGM/UA 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
In 1924, Loews Corp., owner of a chain of movie palaces badly in need of more 
films, bought and merged three Hollywood production houses: Metro Pictures, 
Goldwyn Picture Corp. and Louis B. Mayer Productions. Producer Samuel Goldwyn 
(1882-1974) had departed his failing company in 1922 and never participated in 
MGM. Louis B. Mayer (1885-1957) became the unquestioned boss of MGM in its 
"golden age." 
</P>
<P>
The film company, nearly bankrupt in the late 1960s, has been controlled for 
two decades by financier Kirk Kerkorian, who has used it in a series of 
complicated financial dealings and a foray into Las Vegas hotel-casinos. MGM's 
famed Culver City studio is now owned by Lorimar, its film library belongs to 
Turner Entertainment Co., and the parent MGM/UA is being acquired by Australian 
conglomerate Qintex. 
</P>
<P>
NORTHROP CORP. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based aircraft and electronics manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
John Knudsen Northrop (1895-1981), a tireless inventor with only a high school 
education, worked with flight pioneers Allan Loughead and Donald W. Douglas 
before starting his own company in 1939. He was known for wildly inventive 
designs, such as the ahead-of-its-time flying wing. He retired early from the 
company in 1952, bitter and disappointed after the Air Force canceled his 
flying-wing program. But he lived long enough to see the idea resurrected in 
the new Stealth bomber, which had its maiden flight this year. 
</P>
<P>
RALPHS GROCERY CO. 
</P>
<P>
Compton-based supermarket chain, now a unit of Campeau Corp. 
</P>
<P>
After his career as a bricklayer was curtailed by a hunting accident, George 
Albert Ralphs (1850-1914) became a grocery clerk and, in 1873, went into 
partnership with his boss in a store at Sixth and Spring streets in Los 
Angeles. Later, his brothers Walter and Newell bought in and the business 
became Ralphs Bros. Grocers. 
</P>
<P>
By providing free lodging and stables for farmers bringing their crops to 
market, the Ralphs were able to lock up huge supplies and cut prices below 
their competitors'. The family-run company was sold to Federated Department 
Stores in 1967; acquired by Campeau Corp. in 1988, it has more than 140 
supermarkets throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
ROBINSON'S 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based department store chain, now a unit of the May Department 
Stores Co. 
</P>
<P>
After moving to Los Angeles in 1882 from North Bridgewater, Mass., Joseph 
Winchester Robinson (1846-1891) opened the Boston Dry Goods Store near the 
corner of Temple and Spring streets downtown in February, 1883. It was an 
immediate success, and Robinson became a prominent figure in the community. 
</P>
<P>
After his untimely death at age 45, the store -- by then renamed Robinson's -- 
went through a succession of managers until his son, Harry Winchester Robinson 
(1877-1933) took control in 1924. May bought the chain in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
SMART &amp; FINAL IRIS CORP. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based specialty warehouse grocery chain, now 88%-owned by French 
food conglomerate Etablisement Casino. 
</P>
<P>
James Samuel Smart teamed up with H.P. Final in 1914 to start a cash-and-carry 
wholesale grocery business in Santa Ana. The partners opened more stores and 
warehouses, and in 1952, they acquired Haas Baruch &amp; Co., a grocery 
wholesaler that was a direct descendant of a feed and grain business founded in 
Los Angeles in 1871. 
</P>
<P>
Haas Baruch's popular Iris brand was then added to the company's grocery 
shelves and corporate name. Smart &amp; Final Iris, which operates 100 stores 
in California and Nevada, was acquired in 1957 by Thriftimart, a supermarket 
chain, which in turn was purchased in 1984 by Etablisement Casino. 
</P>
<P>
20th CENTURY FOX FILM CORP. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based movie and television producer.

Hungarian-born William Fox (1879-1952) (originally spelled Fuchs) bought an 
interest in a Brooklyn movie house in 1904 and parlayed the investment into a 
chain of theaters. In 1915, he formed Fox Film Corp. to produce movies for his 
theaters, quickly buying an East Los Angeles studio and then starting his own 
at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
His Hollywood empire crumbled in the Depression, and bankrupt Fox Film was 
merged in 1935 with 20th Century Pictures, founded by movie pioneers Joseph 
Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck. 20th Century Fox, which survived half a dozen 
brushes with collapse and episodes of corporate intrigue in the intervening 
years, is now owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch.

VAN de KAMP'S HOLLAND DUTCH BAKERS 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based regional bakery. 
</P>
<P>
From a store that they opened in 1915 at Second and Spring streets in downtown 
Los Angeles, brothers-in-law Theodore J. Van de Kamp (1891-1956), uncle of 
California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, and Lawrence L. Frank, who later 
founded Lawry's Foods, made and sold potato chips. A shortage of potatoes in 
1916 forced them to sell other items, most notably macaroons, under Van de 
Kamp's label. 
</P>
<P>
The business, known for its blue-and-white windmill logo, grew to include 
self-service bakery counters in grocery stores along the Pacific Coast, coffee 
shops and a frozen foods business. The company, whose ownership has changed 
several times through the years, eventually sold all but its bakery business, 
which still operates from a landmark 1931 building on Fletcher Drive in the 
Northeast Los Angeles "breadbasket," where a number of other regional bakers 
are located. 
</P>
<P>
VONS GROCERY CO. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte-based supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
Charles T. Von der Ahe (1882-1973), a Danish immigrant, founded Von's 
Groceteria at Seventh and Figueroa streets in 1906, expanded it to a chain of 
87 stores and then sold out to a predecessor of Safeway in 1929. With his sons 
Ted and Wil, he began a new Vons Grocery Co. in 1932, which has grown into the 
current El Monte-based supermarket chain with 340 stores and more than $5 
billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
WARNER BROS. INC. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank-based movie and television studio, now part of Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Sons of Polish immigrants, the Warner brothers -- Harry (1881-1958), Albert 
(1884-1967), Sam (1888-1927) and Jack L. Warner (1892-1978) -- started in the 
film business in 1903 with a nickelodeon in Newcastle, Pa., and just a decade 
later were producing films at their own pioneering studio in Hollywood. They 
incorporated their company in 1923, with Harry as president, Albert as 
treasurer, Sam as chief executive and Jack as production chief. 
</P>
<P>
Their production of the first talkie, "The Jazz Singer" in 1927, took them from 
also-ran status to the first tier among Hollywood studios. Harry and Albert 
sold out in 1956, but Jack stayed on until he sold the company in 1967 to Seven 
Arts, a Canadian movie company. In 1969, Warner Bros. was acquired by Kinney 
National, a New York conglomerate that became Warner Communications and is 
currently being acquired by Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
WINCHELL'S DONUT HOUSES 
</P>
<P>
La Mirada-based doughnut chain. 
</P>
<P>
Jukebox operator Verne H. Winchell opened his first doughnut shop in Temple 
City in 1948, then quickly opened others in Huntington Park and South Gate. As 
franchise mania swept the country in the 1960s, Winchell's familiar 
yellow-and-brown stores spread to other states. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell merged his company with the Denny's coffee shop chain in 1968 and 
served as chairman until the 1980s. He sold his stock when Denny's Inc. was 
purchased in 1984, and is now retired. The doughnut chain, with more than 400 
outlets, is being acquired by Shato Holdings, a Canadian firm.

McKinsey May Buy High-Tech Firm: Management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. 
is attempting to buy Information Consulting Group, a consulting company 
specializing in information technology and systems, for an undisclosed price, 
the New York Times reported. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the British advertising 
company that put up seed money for ICG when it was launched last year, also has 
an option to buy the firm, but earlier this year announced its intention to

Fixed-Mortgage Rates Rise: Rates for 30-year fixed mortgages rose 0.13 
percentage points this past week and adjustable-rate mortgages stayed steady, 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said. The agency, which buys mortgages 
from lenders and packages them as securities for sale to investors, said 
interest on fixed-rate loans rose to 10.16% last week, up from 10.03% the week 
before. Adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 8.70%, the same as the previous 
week. The fixed-rate average is for a 30-year loan covering 80% of a home's 
cost. The average adjustable-rate mortgage also is for 30 years but for 75% of 
the home price.

SOME GRAPE CROPS IN STATE DAMAGED BY HEAVY RAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The wine grape harvest in California's north coast is either a disaster or one 
of the best on record, depending on where the winery is located or the grape 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
Until mid-September, a long, cool growing season -- which roughly lasts from 
spring to fall -- had led agricultural experts to estimate that grapes on the 
vine would be 40% to 50% higher in tonnage than last year with exceptionally 
high quality. But heavy rains, which water down the grapes' flavor and rot the 
fruit on the vine, fell in three small waves in the last half of September, 
leaving grape vines in some areas extremely damaged with rot but others 
essentially unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
The first rain, on Sept. 15, delayed the maturing of the grapes. Rain hit on 
the same date in 1986, but that year the rain stopped for the next month and 
the harvest proceeded on schedule. But this year, two additional storms dumped 
more than 2 inches of rain on the region and accelerated the rot problem. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Beckstoffer, one of the north coast's largest growers, said damage from 
rot depends on the region and the grape variety. 
</P>
<P>
In the Napa Valley, from St. Helena south through the Carneros region that 
butts up against San Pablo Bay, he said, the Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 
varieties were hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Arrowood, wine maker at Chateau St. Jean in Sonoma Valley, said the 
Alexander Valley in northern Sonoma County suffered, but there was much less 
damage in the Sonoma Valley to the south. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard to Estimate 
</P>
<P>
However, wine makers in some regions -- notably those whose vineyards are 
planted on mountainsides -- experienced far fewer problems. "For me, it was one 
of the best vintages we've ever had," Stu Smith, owner of Smith-Madrone Winery 
on Spring Mountain overlooking the Napa Valley, said. He said his Cabernet 
Sauvignon grapes needed some rain, and "we have good drainage, so we actually 
benefited from it." 
</P>
<P>
The rains have created delays but few losses so far for grape growers in the 
central valley who were a little farther along in harvesting their grapes. 
Robert Cabral of Escalon said he is a week to 10 days behind because of the 
rains. "I still have half of mine to go. We'll finish up this week. The quality 
of black grapes is holding up pretty good. We're not worried too much," he said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Other growers, such as Bruce A. Mettler of Lodi, beat the rains. Mike Henry of 
the California Farm Bureau said central valley grape growers are not likely to 
sustain "major losses" as are their counterparts, particularly in Medocino and 
Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to fix a dollar loss for the 1989 harvest, experts say. If the grape 
crop had been significantly larger than last year, spot prices for grapes would 
have dropped. With the crop now expected not to be much larger than last year, 
prices may not drop, reflecting the smaller amount of grapes available. 
</P>
<P>
One estimate that the net loss to growers in Sonoma and Mendocino counties 
could reach $30 million was questioned by Beckstoffer, who said his ranches in 
the Mendocino County area were mostly picked before the second -- and most 
damaging -- rain fell in the third week of September. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out of it very well," he said. "When the rain hit in Mendocino, our 
grapes had already reached the right sugar, so we could pick. But some folks in 
Napa had to wait, and there will be some losses there." 
</P>
<P>
By this past weekend, most of the Cabernet in the Napa Valley was still on the 
vine, "and most of it looks beautiful," Beckstoffer said. "Some vineyards were 
helped by the rain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Than Expected 
</P>
<P>
He said his company was supposed to deliver 3,000 tons of Chardonnay, "which is 
significantly up from last year, and we will deliver 2,700 tons, which is still 
well above last year." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest disappointment for growers, said Beckstoffer, is simply that a 
month ago they anticipated a huge crop worth a lot of money. "Now it's only 
going to be a good-sized crop, so the big surplus that we anticipated is over." 
</P>
<P>
In Lake County, most vineyards were harvested before the rains hit, according 
to Derek Holstein, wine maker for Guenoc Winery. And south of San Francisco, in 
Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, little rain fell, and 
crop size and quality were reported high.

BOEING MACHINISTS CONTRACT TALKS BOG DOWN 
</P>

<P>
With a strike deadline approaching, contract talks bogged down Sunday between 
Boeing Co. and the machinists union, which wants a share of the aerospace 
firm's bulging profits. 
</P>
<P>
The approximately 60 negotiators who have been meeting since Sept. 21 moved to 
round-the-clock talks over the weekend. The workers' three-year contract 
expires at midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Union spokesman Jack Daniels said talks reached "a point of no movement" and 
the parties took an unspecified break to call in a federal mediator, Douglas P. 
Hammond, who met with both sides on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's 57,000 union machinists in the Seattle area, Portland, Ore., and 
Wichita, Kan., have voted to strike if an acceptable contract is not reached by 
the end of the day Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, negotiators agreed to extend a strike deadline, but Daniels said it 
would be "pure guesswork" to say whether that would happen again. The last 
machinists strike against Boeing, in 1977, lasted two months. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft builder, is enjoying its fifth 
straight year of record jetliner orders. So far this year, carriers have 
ordered 736 Boeing jets worth $38.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Though Pentagon cutbacks have subdued military business, Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth roughly $70 billion, with 
deliveries set for well into the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts, as well as some Boeing employees, doubt that a strike 
is likely, given the pressure on Boeing to deliver a full order book of 
commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on history, the union and Boeing have usually had a pretty good 
relationship," said William Whitlow, an analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc. in 
Seattle. "I think there is room for compromise." 
</P>
<P>
But Daniels said there had been little movement on such key issues as a pay 
increase, whether the money will come as a wage hike or a bonus, retirement 
benefits and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing officials declined to say what the company's plans would be in case of a 
strike or to comment on negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists have agreements that members of other unions will not do their 
work in the event of a strike, but other Boeing unions have no-strike clauses 
in their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1989, Boeing had net earnings of $356 million on sales of 
$9.07 billion. For 1988, profits were $614 million on $16.96 billion in sales.

FOREIGN FIRMS WARY OF CHINA, SAYS OFFICIAL 
</P>

<P>
The June 3-4 martial law crackdown against pro-democracy protests in Beijing 
has left foreign businesses facing "a fundamentally changed situation" in 
China, according to Roger W. Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
From the autumn of 1986, when Beijing stepped up its efforts to create more 
favorable conditions for foreign investment, right up until the June crackdown, 
foreigners in China could see steady progress in the creation of a better 
business environment, Sullivan said in a weekend interview. This included steps 
forward in areas such as reduced bureaucratic interference, a more workable 
legal structure and the availability of necessary financial services. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials insist that reform is still on track, making comments such as 
"nothing's changed that much," said Sullivan, who met with Vice Premier Tian 
Jiyun and with Zheng Tuobin, minister of foreign economic relations and trade. 
</P>
<P>
"But what people were looking at was the fact that with every passing month, 
the situation here seemed to get better. So people were straight-lining that 
out and assuming that five years from now it's going to be a lot better," he 
explained. "Now you've just cut that confidence out from under them. . . . 
There isn't any trend line. We don't know where it's going." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders, including Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who 
was appointed in late June to replace reformist former General Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang, have repeatedly stressed that China intends to continue its policies of 
reform and openness to the outside world, Sullivan pointed out. But the same 
leaders have also used harsh rhetoric criticizing capitalism and Western 
countries, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The council that Sullivan heads is an association of American companies 
involved in trade or investment in China. Within China, he is viewed as a 
spokesman for U.S. businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the point in every one of the meetings that (foreign business) people 
just aren't reassured by the statements of what the policy is, because they're 
confused by the mixed rhetoric," Sullivan said. "It just doesn't strike foreign 
companies as being a stable environment in the sense of policy." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan also said that foreign business confidence in China will depend on 
forward movement in its economic restructuring and especially in the creation 
of a better investment environment. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'We're going to maintain all these (reform-oriented) regulations and 
policies in place,"' he said. "That's just not good enough. The point is, 
(before June) it was improving and it was going to continue to improve." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said one hopeful sign that he found was that the high officials he met 
seemed to recognize the need to back up verbal commitments to reform with 
concrete measures. 
</P>
<P>
Tian and Zheng seemed to show "real concern about a deterioration in their 
relationship with the United States, and the deterioration of their economy 
resulting from deterioration of the relationship with the United States," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said the types of steps that China could take to reassure foreigners 
would be things like making credit more easily available to joint ventures, or 
passing new reform-oriented legislation. He cited as examples such 
long-discussed measures as a law protecting intellectual property rights and a 
law that would allow foreigners to serve as chairmen of boards for joint 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan expressed disappointment, however, in General Secretary Jiang's first 
major policy address, which was delivered Friday as part of celebrations 
honoring the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
"What bothers me is his attitude toward reform," Sullivan said. "The best you 
can say about it is that he's trying to define a policy of openness to the 
outside world without reform. I don't think that's possible." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said he was particularly disturbed by references in Jiang's speech to 
new restrictions on collective and private enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials, explaining a growing move to dismantle some of these small 
but dynamic enterprises, insist "that they're only being shut down because 
they're inefficient and waste raw materials," Sullivan pointed out. But it 
seems that they are actually being shut down because they compete too 
successfully with large but poorly run state enterprises, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said he felt that Jiang's statements were "almost Orwellian," adding, 
"He's supposed to be the moderate! It doesn't look very encouraging."

MEMO: SCREEN WRITING

<P>
Ever wonder how long it takes a typist to type up a screenplay? 
</P>
<P>
Those in the business say it requires at least 10 hours to professionally type 
a 100-page screenplay. It takes at least another three hours to proof the 
script. And typing screenplays that are handwritten can take at least twice as 
long, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Another Hollywood industry that relies on screenwriters -- and which 
screenwriters depend upon heavily -- is the agency business. 
</P>
<P>
Agents try to make contacts with studio executives who may be interested in 
screenplays. The standard fee for agents: 10% of the selling price of the 
script. 
</P>
<P>
How much should a screenwriter pay for computer equipment? 
</P>
<P>
That depends, of course, on the writer -- and the store. But the Writer's 
Computer Store in West Los Angeles sells complete hardware and software 
packages for $1,800 to $6,000, said co-owner Gabriele Zinke. "After $6,000," 
said Zinke, "I'd really have to think hard to figure out anything else to add 
on." BRUCE HOROVITZ

COMPUTER LETS SCREENWRITER DO JOB AT HOME 
</P>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Steve Sharon wrote the screenplay to the Clint Eastwood thriller "The Dead 
Pool," he didn't rely much on outside help. He typed away on a computer in his 
Huntington Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't even use a typing service or a research assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do the typing just as quickly myself," he said. "And I prefer to do my 
own research so I have a fuller understanding of whatever it is I'm writing 
about." 
</P>
<P>
But he does have his own special -- and rather costly -- computer equipment. 
And he has attended several seminars on screen writing techniques. "Always 
check the background of the person teaching the seminar," he suggests. "If 
they've sold some screenplays, it probably gives them more credibility, but 
that's not necessarily a prerequisite." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, 33, also said novice screenwriters probably don't need to invest in a 
large library of screen writing books. "There's nothing new being invented 
about writing screenplays," said Sharon. "If you've read one good book, you 
probably don't need any others." 
</P>
<P>
The business of screen writing is very unusual, Sharon said. "A screenwriter is 
someone who creates his own problems and then tries to solve them as creatively 
as possible." BRUCE HOROVITZ

Sitting in a tattered cardboard box on the floor, it looked much like any other 
screenplay. But something about one called "Beverly Hills Cop" caught the eye 
of Gabriele Zinke. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember looking at the title and thinking that was pretty funny," said 
Zinke, who co-owns the Writer's Computer Store, a Los Angeles company 
specializing in computer hardware and software for screenwriters. 
</P>
<P>
"Beverly Hills Cop" was composed on a computer -- and with software -- 
purchased at the Writer's Computer Store. "This might sound silly," said Zinke, 
"but any time something successful is written on one of our computers, I feel 
like I'm a small part of it." 
</P>
<P>
These days, it seems that everyone wants to play their part in the movie 
business. And a growing number of Los Angeles area companies are finding ways 
to make some profits servicing screenwriters. 
</P>
<P>
Just a decade ago, about all the assistance that screenwriters had to choose 
from were secretaries to type finished scripts and photocopy stores to make 
extra sets of the screenplays. But today, screenwriters -- and wanna-be 
screenwriters -- seem to have an endless selection of services. 
</P>
<P>
For the novice, there are numerous courses on how to write screenplays. And for 
the seasoned screenwriter, many companies such as Zinke's sell thousands of 
dollars in computer hardware and software specifically designed for script 
writing. There are also so-called script doctors who, for a price, will tell 
you if your screenplay is any good. And there are researchers who will help 
busy screenwriters find out any facts -- historical or otherwise -- that they 
might need to know for their scripts. There are even some psychotherapists who 
say they can help screenwriters overcome one of the most common problems of all 
-- writer's block. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than a cottage industry -- it's enormous," said George Kirgo, 
president of the West Coast division of the Writer's Guild of America. "Some 
screenwriters will swear by the courses, the computer stores and the 
what-have-you's," said Kirgo, whose West Coast guild has 7,500 members, "but 
there are plenty of fly-by-nights, like in every other business." 
</P>
<P>
What has caused this sudden growth? "There's been an absolute explosion because 
of all the money involved in screen writing," said Syd Field, author of two 
books on screen writing technique and one of the most highly regarded names in 
the profession of screen writing instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that while top scripts sold for $60,000 just a few years ago, 
they can now fetch upward of $600,000. "The joke is that if you're in the film 
business, your pool man, barber and taxi driver will all have a script to show 
you," said Kirgo. "It's become the glamour industry of Los Angeles and New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
Some say that all a screenwriter needs to write a successful screenplay is a 
very good idea, a piece of paper and a pen. But the way Field figures it, that 
may be the exception. Even a novice can quickly spend a total of about $1,000 
to attend some basic screen writing classes, have a completed script typed by a 
professional and have a dozen copies made for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to be in film," said Field, whose company, Screenwriters Inc., 
will also critique screenplays for $295. "We have a generation of young people 
who have grown up watching TV and going to the movies. So their tendency isn't 
to write books, but to write for TV and films." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, this is the tendency of Dan Petrie Jr., who not only wrote "Beverly 
Hills Cop" but also "The Big Easy," and co-wrote the screenplays "Turner &amp; 
Hooch" and "Shoot to Kill." And while Petrie figures that he has spent up to 
$10,000 for computer hardware and software, he doesn't think that most 
screenwriters need to go overboard on equipment and courses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say, you can probably spend less and get more," Petrie said. "If I was 
going to spend $1,000 for a screen writing class, I'd like to know that the guy 
teaching it is Neil Simon." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gordon isn't Neil Simon. But the 27-year-old graduate of USC Film School 
recently started a company called Writer's Boot Camp that offers 10-session 
courses for $900. "The price reflects the quality of the course," said Gordon, 
who insists that writers who complete the course will have extensively 
developed their plot lines and their main characters. At the other end of the 
price spectrum are screen writing courses -- which include nine class sessions 
for $185 -- offered through UCLA Extension. 
</P>
<P>
Once screen writing hopefuls have learned the technique -- and come up with a 
plot -- the next decision is whether to type the screenplay on a typewriter or 
a computer. And no matter what decision that screenwriters make, plenty of 
companies stand to profit from them. 
</P>
<P>
One Santa Monica company, for example, can take a script that's been typed on 
paper, run it through a special machine that scans the words and records the 
script on a computer disk. "It's kind of like reverse printing," said Jay 
Brown, operations director at On Word Inc. 
</P>
<P>
On Word charges about $85 to place a typed script on computer disk. More than a 
year ago, the screenplay to the film "Batman" was brought into the company. "It 
went through here before anyone even knew about it," said Brown. "I remember 
thinking it was pretty weird that there was a Batman movie without Robin in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Then, there are specialists who simply type screenplays into the proper format. 
Costs vary from $100 to $350. 
</P>
<P>
They say there's no telling where the screenplays will come from. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara's Place, one of the better-known Los Angeles-area screenplay typing 
specialists, recently received a script from the North Pole. "I thought it was 
a joke until the check cleared" said Susan Johannesson, owner of the company. 
Barbara's Place typed one of the final versions of the film "Out of Africa" 
several years ago. "Anyone can type up their own scripts," said Johannesson, 
"but when we do it, the screenplay looks professional." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there are companies that will do research of any kind for 
screenwriters -- for a price. The Silver Lake company, Legworks, charges about 
$40 an hour to help screenwriters get the facts straight. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the work that the research company does is confidential, but the 
requests can vary wildly. For one writer, the company looked into the cost of 
leasing office space in the Empire State Building in 1933. But for a story that 
another writer was working on about teen-age runaways, the company's co-founder 
Sandy Ferguson recently hung around a Los Angeles bus depot to observe runaways 
firsthand. "I learned real fast how to pick out a runaway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But few Hollywood studios will pick up the tab for researchers. "It's 
considered a luxury item," said Ferguson. "Most screenwriters are forced to pay 
researchers out of their own pockets." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it sounds a bit too Hollywood. But there is even a woman who says she 
specializes in helping screenwriters overcome writer's block. This is what 
happens to some screenwriters when they get stuck in ruts and are unable to 
make progress in writing their scripts. 
</P>
<P>
The woman is Rachel Ballon, a screenwriter and licensed psychotherapist who 
also teaches screenwriters how to deal with rejection. Ballon has sold several 
TV scripts and one movie script. Her Brentwood company, Rachel Ballon &amp; 
Co., offers individual or group classes -- from $35 to $95 per hour -- about 
"how to survive" in the entertainment industry, said Ballon. 
</P>
<P>
"You put two years of your life into writing a screenplay and it can be 
rejected in two minutes," said Ballon. "Writers have to be taught how to go out 
and survive." 
</P>
<P>
Many screenwriters count too heavily on their scripts to sell, she said. "There 
are people who put their lives at stake on a single script," she said. "I tell 
them that won't work. They also have to love the process of writing." 
</P>
<P>
And some have rather unexpected problems. "I've talked with people who haven't 
even written a word yet," said Ballon, "and they're already worrying about 
foreign distribution rights."

AISSA WAYNE FILES SUIT IN 1988 GARAGE ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The daughter of the late John Wayne has sued her former husband for allegedly 
arranging an assault on her and her boyfriend a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Aissa Wayne said Sunday that the Oct. 3, 1988, attack was an attempt to 
intimidate her so she would not seek sole custody of their daughter, Anastasia, 
2. The suit filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court seeks unspecified 
damages from her former husband, Thomas A. Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're assaulted, there's a lot of anger involved," said Wayne, who 
called the lawsuit "just a remedy." 
</P>
<P>
Gionis and his attorney could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, 33, and Roger Luby, 53, her boyfriend at the time, were beaten in the 
garage of Luby's Newport Beach home. Two men smashed the couple's faces against 
the concrete floor and slashed Luby's Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, an orthopedic surgeon, faces an Oct. 31 criminal trial in Orange County 
Superior Court in which he is accused of hiring a private investigator to 
arrange the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said Sunday that she filed the lawsuit to comply with a one-year statute 
of limitations on civil actions from the date of an incident. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne added that her civil suit seeks "to recover damages for the assault," but 
she added that Gionis is "in bankruptcy, so it's really the principle." 
</P>
<P>
"People shouldn't get away with violence and intimidation, especially when it 
has to do with children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In divorce proceedings, Wayne was awarded a judgment of $1.3 million. But she 
said she has not yet collected on that.

DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER BICYCLIST IS HIT, KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 33-year-old bicyclist was struck and killed by a suspected drunk driver in 
Santa Ana on Sunday afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, a Santa Ana man whose name was being withheld pending notification 
of relatives, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 6:45 p.m. accident on 
17th Street just west of Fairview Street. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car that hit him, Willie Hudson, 36, of Santa Ana, was 
arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and taken to 
the Santa Ana City Jail, Police Sgt. Bob Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the man who was killed was pedaling his bike west on 17th, along the 
north curb, when Hudson's subcompact car -- also headed west -- struck him from 
the rear. The victim was thrown 80 feet into the street, Clark said.

To speed police and fire response times, Huntington Beach officials will start 
enforcing a law requiring homes and businesses to make their addresses visible 
from the street. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of problems with our larger (apartment and industrial) complexes 
in finding the addresses," Fire Department Capt. Tom Huntley said.

City inspectors have the authority to fine building owners for not complying 
with the law, but that probably will not be necessary, Huntley said.

AMBIGUOUS ART CARVED DOWN TO THE NITTY-GRITTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the beach at Corona del Mar on Sunday, a woman sauntered past an impressive 
carving in the sand, where skilled hands had fashioned a hulking mass of wet 
beachfront into a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you do this?" the woman inquired of a man, whose knees and fingernails 
were answer enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh huh," said John DiLauro, smiling and proud. 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" the woman asked. 
</P>
<P>
Art can be ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
DiLauro's smile faded a bit as he said the sculpture was a sandcastle. And by 
the way, it was actually his son, John DiLauro the architect, who was 
responsible for the carving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an abstract sculpture," son John said. "A series of planes -- horizontal, 
vertical." 
</P>
<P>
Not every castle and creature formed Sunday at the 1989 Invitational Sandcastle 
Competition was as open to interpretation as the DiLauro creation. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 26 entries in the competition, sponsored by the county chapter of 
the American Institute of Architecture, were clearly what they appeared to be: 
castles, astronauts, turtles, lobster and a bust of Pete Rose with the caption: 
"$10 says I don't bet on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"This contest is much more than running sand through your hands. . . . This is 
big-time carving," said Loralyn Reif, spokeswoman for the event. 
</P>
<P>
The competition promotes public awareness of architecture and raises money 
through entry fees and T-shirt sales for the institute's educational programs, 
scholarships and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
The participants, architects, architectural firms and professional sand 
sculptors had just five hours to complete their work. Entries were judged on 
best use of site, originality and design, degree of difficulty and detail and 
execution. Winners received plaques and applause. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of judges -- including architects, Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley and Times architecture critic Sam Hall Kaplan -- awarded the grand prize 
to a crew representing architect Joseph Woolett for a neatly fashioned series 
of classical columns. 
</P>
<P>
First place in the "sandcastle" category went to the Newport Beach 
architectural firm of Dougherty &amp; Dougherty, whose handiwork featured crisp 
lines and lifelike detail. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the sand sculpture category, ambiguity appeared to reign. Bill 
Crook, owner of WRC Associates of Newport Beach, accepted without explanation 
the winning plaque for a what was called "a derailed train." 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a derailed train," Crook said later. "It was a spaceman coming 
around on a crater." 
</P>
<P>
Who called it a derailed train? 
</P>
<P>
"The judges," Crook said.

LATE MAGIC VANISHES FOR 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the San Francisco 49ers found themselves in dire straits in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Given the 49ers' method of operation this season, however, it didn't seem such 
a bad place to be during their home opener against the Rams Sunday at 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Still, things could have been better. Joe Montana, their celebrated 
quarterback, had not thrown a touchdown pass. Jerry Rice, their celebrated wide 
receiver, caught just two passes for a measly 36 yards. The rushing game was in 
hibernation during the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cofer's 17-yard field goal gave the 49ers a 12-10 lead early in the fourth 
quarter. After a Ram series of downs -- three plays, a punt and three penalties 
against the visitors -- the 49ers began a drive from their 31 with 7 minutes 27 
seconds left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Now, wasn't it time for Joe Montana to lead the 49ers to a game-clinching 
touchdown, using as much of the clock as possible before scoring? A two-point 
lead was nice, but the 49ers were looking for a touchdown and a nine-point 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
After all, that had been the pattern in the 49ers' last two games: fall behind, 
then stage a fourth-quarter rally to win. 
</P>
<P>
It worked at Philadelphia last week, when the 49ers stumbled through three 
quarters against the Eagles, only to have Montana bail them out with four 
touchdown passes in the fourth quarter of a 38-28 victory. It wasn't quite so 
dramatic at Tampa Bay two weeks ago, but San Francisco still won on a 
last-minute drive. 
</P>
<P>
But the magic ended somewhere on the Rams' 20-yard line Sunday. Fullback Tom 
Rathman, a sure-handed bull in shoulder pads, fumbled there with 2:59 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams then drove to the 49er eight, where Mike Lansford kicked a 26-yard, 
game-winning field goal with two seconds remaining. While the Rams celebrated 
their fourth consecutive victory and a spot at the top of the NFC West, the 
49ers were left to wonder what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't keep waiting for fourth-quarter miracles," said George Seifert, 49er 
coach. "We've got to come out better, sooner in the game." 
</P>
<P>
No one in the 49er locker room felt worse than Rathman. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I should take the blame for the loss because I did fumble," he said. "I 
had set a goal for myself to not fumble all year, and here that goal is gone 
already, in the fourth game. I had gone all last year without fumbling." 
</P>
<P>
Rathman and Roger Craig had carried the ball almost exclusively on the 49ers' 
final drive. San Francisco had a first down at the Ram 20 when Montana handed 
the ball to Rathman, who cut toward the line and appeared headed for a sizable 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody just swatted (the ball) out when I was getting up to the hole," 
Rathman said. "I guess I just didn't have it put away." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene pounced on the ball, and the Rams gained a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had other problems, too. Rice was stifled by the Ram defensive backs. 
The running game was hurt by poor play on the offensive line, especially in the 
first half. And the secondary, playing without injured safeties Ronnie Lott and 
Chet Brooks, had a hard time keeping up with the Ram receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some chances," Rice said. "I feel I didn't play well. They wanted to 
take the receivers out of the game, and they did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Montana completed 25 of 35 passes for 227 yards. His longest completion went 
for 30 yards. It wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers gained 152 yards on the ground, 104 in the second half. That wasn't 
enough either. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Montana, Ram quarterback Jim Everett completed big passes when he needed 
them most. He found Flipper Anderson for a 65-yard touchdown play in the second 
quarter, the game's only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
On the final drive, Everett completed passes of 19 yards to Anderson and 31 and 
16 yards to Pete Holohan. In each case, the receiver was wide open. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard to play a perfect defensive game -- there are always going to 
be one or two mistakes," 49er safety Jeff Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the 49ers made just enough mistakes to lose.

How much did the San Francisco 49ers miss Pro Bowl free safety Ronnie Lott, 
sidelined Sunday by a bad ankle? 
</P>
<P>
Enough that the Rams were glad he was a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Lott's) not in there, you can take your rib pads off," said Pete Holohan 
of Lott, who has carved out a reputation as one of the league's fiercest 
hitters. "He's a stud." 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Jim Everett: "Lott being out made a difference. I'm not blind. 
I've always called him the glue of (their) defense." 
</P>
<P>
In Lott's place Sunday was Jeff Fuller. He had six tackles and an assist, but 
hardly was the force Lott is during a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronnie Lott's a great player. When a guy like (Lott) isn't in there, you 
obviously get hurt, to some degree," Holohan said. "The guys that were in there 
filling in did a really good job. It's not like we dominated them by any 
means." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Cleveland Gary made his long-awaited Ram debut and was less than 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, he only was given two chances to carry the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Used sparingly -- partly because of the tight score and partly because the 
49ers were shutting down the Ram running attack -- Gary gained five yards on 
his first National Football League rushing attempt. It came on the last play of 
the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Gary's second and final run of the day took place in the second quarter and 
resulted in no gain. 
</P>
<P>
But look at this way: it's only one yard less than Gaston Green has rushed for 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good," Gary said. "I'm just happy to be part of a winning team." 
</P>
<P>
If Gary was nervous about the debut, he wasn't showing it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no pressure on me," he said. "I was very relaxed. But I'm very glad to 
get my professional football career started. Coach (John) Robinson has worked 
with me. I feel more confident with the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Flipper Anderson continues to receive rave reviews. And why not? 
He caught four passes for 112 yards, including a 65-yarder for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie Anderson has made great strides and he continues to get better," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson: "I thought I might see a lot of single coverage today. I gave 
the cornerback a little stutter step and he bit on it all the way." 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown catch was the longest of his entire playing career and the first 
of his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers lost the game, but not their confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Bubba Paris, veteran offensive tackle, said, "It's extremely disappointing to 
lose, but we have all the talent and character that's needed to go out and 
capture another Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Coach George Seifert was discouraged by the loss and by the sluggish manner in 
which the team began Sunday. "We've got to come back," he said. "This team has 
certainly done it before." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cofer of San Francisco outkicked counterpart Mike Lansford, four field 
goals to two, but was hoping for a chance at a game-winning field goal himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope I get the chance to kick the winning field goal next time," he 
said. "I'm a little bit more relaxed this year, but before the games, I still 
get the same old butterflies I had in high school. I guess they'll always be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rathman on the fumble that set up the Rams' winning drive: "I felt like . . 
. coming off the field. Everybody tries to cheer you up, but you feel like the 
butt of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Add Rathman: "The last time I remember making a crucial fumble was in my rookie 
year against Denver in a preseason game. Back then I was just a frisky 
freshman, fighting for everything I could get." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe Montana, quarterback, philosopher: "It's a funny thing about the game, 
sometimes it happens that way."

MARINA CELEBRATES END OF LONG DRY SPELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elliott Teaford 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 18 games covering parts of three seasons, Marina High School finally won 
a football game. 
</P>
<P>
The last Viking victory came in their final nonleague game of the 1987 season. 
After beating Millikan, 26-25, Marina dropped 18 in a row, including its first 
three this season. But Thursday night, Marina defeated Lakewood, 17-7, at 
Westminster High to end the streak, which had been the longest current stretch 
in Orange County football. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to come, we didn't know when," Marina Coach John Seeley 
said during a lull in the celebrating Friday afternoon. "Our kids never really 
thought about the losing streak. Everything has been a new approach this year. 
There's a new attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Marina players celebrated heartily. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought they won the Super Bowl," Seeley said. "As far as our program is 
concerned, it was a big win." 
</P>
<P>
It might have been biggest to Darren Fields, David McCloud and David Schultz, 
three seniors who have played on the varsity since they were sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz completed 16 of 28 passes for 231 yards and two touchdowns, and Fields 
caught 11 passes for 160 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably meant more to them than to some of the other kids," said Seeley, 
in his first season as Marina coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I've coached teams where they haven't had the talent and still won. 
That wasn't so here. There was just a missing ingredient. We haven't turned the 
corner yet. We're still struggling, but we're on our way." 
</P>
<P>
Seeley is encouraged by the turnout for his lower-level teams. The sophomores 
(3-0) have 48 players on the roster, 20 more than last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got the ball rolling," he said. "I felt that at the beginning of 
the season. Things have really improved in our football program. 
</P>
<P>
"I see us getting better each week. We've finally come to our first goal, which 
is to get a victory. Now we need to work on getting to the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
And the official count is . . . low: The Orange County Officials Assn. has lost 
about 40 to 50 of its members this year and has had problems getting all the 
football games assigned, according to Scott Cathcart, the Southern Section 
director of media relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, throughout (the Southern Section), the numbers of officials are 
down," said Cathcart, who has been officiating for the past six years. "And 
it's across the board, in all sports." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes there is no particular cause, but that the numbers seem to 
run in cycles over the years. The money, he said, doesn't seem to be a 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a referee's fee for a night varsity football game is $45 (day 
games are $42). Water polo officials earn $27 for a day game and $50 for a 
night tripleheader. Volleyball officials earn $32 for a day match and $60 for a 
night doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the schools and the coaches to help recruit graduating seniors who 
have been involved in athletics to get them interested in officiating," 
Cathcart said. "It can be a very good avocation for anybody who's into sports." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Tim Devaney, Sunny Hills football coach, took his team to Edmonton, 
Canada, last week to play a game he thought was football. Well, it was, but 
with a twist. 
</P>
<P>
Of the longer, wider Canadian field, Devaney said: "The field was so big, we 
needed binoculars on the sideline just to see where the ball was." 
</P>
<P>
Of the "single," which awards a team a point if it can prevent an opponent from 
returning a kick out of its end zone, he said: "We were winning, 21-0, and 
Brian Pizula kicked the ball into the end zone. I looked up and it was 22-0. I 
didn't know what was going on, but I liked it." 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills defeated La Zerte High, 51-0. 
</P>
<P>
Division won?: Through four weeks of nonleague play, Orange County's Division I 
teams aren't playing like top-level teams. Division I teams are only 9-14 
against the lower division. 
</P>
<P>
And it took two victories in three tries last week to improve that much. 
</P>
<P>
In the second week, Division I team were only 1-6 against lower-division teams. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei lost to Tustin (Division VI), Servite lost to Los Alamitos (Division 
III), Fountain Valley lost to El Toro (Division III), Edison lost to Capistrano 
Valley (Division III), Ocean View lost to Newport Harbor (Division VI) and 
Marina lost to Corona del Mar (Division VI). 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach, which defeated Pacifica (Division VI), was the only Division 
I team to beat a lower-division team. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this has to do with the growth of population and enrollment in the 
South County, where Division III schools such as Capistrano Valley, El Toro and 
Mission Viejo have been the most consistent winners in the 1980s. 
</P>

BEHIND-SCENES SOVIET ROLE IN E. GERMAN EXODUS TOLD

West Germany hinted strongly today that the Soviet Union had helped to arrange 
the surprise exodus of more than 6,000 East Germans as a new dispute between 
the two Germanys left the fate of hundreds of other refugees in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Hans Klein said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had 
been in constant contact with Chancellor Helmut Kohl since East Germans began 
taking refuge in West German embassies in Budapest, Prague and Warsaw in July. 
</P>
<P>
Klein declined to give details of the communications between Gorbachev and 
Kohl, but another senior official indicated that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze had given his blessing to the deal in talks at the United 
Nations in New York last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Shevardnadze was helpful," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported today that Shevardnadze 
was moved by West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's description 
of the grim conditions in the overcrowded embassy in Prague and persuaded the 
East Germans to soften their initially hard line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leave on Special Trains 
</P>
<P>
Under an unprecedented deal, more than 6,000 East Germans traveled to West 
Germany Sunday on special trains from Prague and Warsaw that took them through 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But today East Germany accused Bonn of breaking its word over the deal by 
allowing hundreds of other refugees into its embassies in Prague and Warsaw and 
said the West Germans should eject the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Well over 1,000 East Germans took refuge in the West German embassy in Prague 
today, freely entering the front door.

Britain's opposition Labor Party today scrapped its longstanding commitment to

his drive to steer the party on a new moderate course.

A revised defense strategy which abandons a unilateral approach and commits 
Labor to joining global disarmament talks was approved by a 3-2 margin on the 
second day of the party's weeklong annual conference.

TEXAS SCHOOL FINANCING UPSET

The Texas Supreme Court, saying "efficient" doesn't mean "cheap," ruled today 
that the state's method of financing schools is unconstitutional and gave 
lawmakers until May to develop a new one. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member court, however, said it would not instruct the Legislature what 
specific steps to take to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A state district judge had held the school finance system unconstitutional in a 
case brought by poor school districts against the state education commissioner 
and others. That ruling was overturned last December by the U.S. 3rd Circuit 
Court of Appeals, but the high court upheld the plaintiffs today on the ground 
that the Constitution requires "efficiency" in government. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold that the state's school financing system is neither financially 
efficient, nor efficient in the sense of providing for a 'general diffusion of 
knowledge' statewide," Justice Oscar Mauzy's opinion said.

Actor George Hamilton has been described by federal authorities as an 
unindicted co-conspirator of former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos, it was 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton's name appeared on documents filed in U.S. District Court in 
connection with the case against Marcos, according to New York Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
An indictment last October charged that Marcos and her husband, the late 
Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, stole $168 million from the 
Philippine treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Also named were Manhattan real estate developers Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, 
who are brothers, and the Marcos children, Irene, Imee and Ferdinand Jr., the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The list of unindicted co-conspirators was included in a pretrial motion filed 
by one of Marcos' co-defendants, California Overseas Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, known for his perpetual tan and for his portrayal of a vampire in 
the movie "Love at First Bite," has denied rumors that he and Marcos were

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said today after a meeting with President Bush 
that a "golden opportunity" exists for an eventual settlement of the conflict 
between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Bush for almost an hour, Mubarak told reporters that the 
essential next step in the peace process is to persuade the Israelis and the 
Palestinians to enter into a dialogue without conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a grave mistake to miss the golden opportunity existing today," 
Mubarak said. "A continuation of the status quo is hazardous to both parties." 
</P>
<P>
Hours before the Bush-Mubarak meeting, an Egyptian newspaper reported that the 
United States had proposed formation of a joint Egyptian-Israeli committee to 
pave the way for elections in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III confirmed the general idea, saying the 
panel, with U.S. participation, would give Israel a chance to approve or 
disapprove individual Palestinians who would take part in talks with Israel.

The most important drug suspect seized since Colombia began a major drug 
crackdown six weeks ago will be flown to Bogota in a matter of hours to face 
drug smuggling charges, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Evaristo Porras Ardila, linked to the powerful Medellin cocaine cartel, was 
being held in the southwestern city of Pasto after being deported Sunday night 
from Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Administrative Security said he will be flown to the capital 
and brought before a judge to face the smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not on U.S. List 
</P>
<P>
Porras is not on the list of 12 "most wanted" suspects whose extradition is 
sought by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Department of Administrative Security spokesman Diva Rojas said he is the 
most important drug suspect caught since the crackdown began Aug. 18. A Defense 
Ministry spokesman described him as a "trafficker of the first order." 
</P>
<P>
The Bogota daily newspaper El Tiempo said Porras was the administrator of the 
Medellin cartel's operations in southern Colombia, especially its Amazon jungle 
cocaine laboratories on the borders with Brazil and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorean authorities said Porras was deported Sunday night on grounds of 
having an expired visa and using falsified documents. 
</P>
<P>
They said Porras, who was arrested Wednesday in his Quito apartment, lived in 
Ecuador under an assumed name since 1987 and ran a Quito company that did 
foreign trade in farm machinery.

Pope John Paul II and Anglican leader Robert A. K. Runcie pledged today to 
search for unity but noted that the Anglican ordination of women remains an 
obstacle to healing the churches' 400-year-old schism. 
</P>
<P>
"We solemnly recommit ourselves and those we represent to the restoration of 
visible unity and full ecclesial Communion," said a declaration they signed at 
the end of Runcie's first official visit to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Runcie, who as archbishop of Canterbury is spiritual head of the state Church 
of England and leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, said the commitment 
to continue talks on unification with the 850 million Roman Catholics should 
not be dismissed as "a pure academic exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Runcie told a news conference that his four-day trip allowed him to build trust 
with Vatican officials. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican officials also promised to respond soon to a 7-year-old report by an 
Anglican-Catholic commission outlining possible theological agreements between 
the churches, he said. Anglican bishops have accepted the report. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican and Anglican officials have been holding talks since 1966 on unifying 
their churches, which split four centuries ago over the Pope's refusal to annul 
King Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. 
</P>
<P>
The new declaration noted problems raised in recent years by the ordination of 
women in some of the Anglican Communion's 27 self-governing provinces, 
including the U.S. Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
"The question and practice of the admission of women to the ministerial 
priesthood in some provinces of the Anglican Communion prevents reconciliation 
between us even where there is otherwise progress toward agreement in faith on 
the meaning of the Eucharist and the ordained ministry," the declaration said.

Hundreds of people cheered and threw rice as 11 homosexual couples got married 
on the day a new law allowing such unions went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The couples got married in a ceremony Sunday at the Town Hall. Hundreds of 
supporters waved flags and threw rice, while a group of Christian 
fundamentalists demonstrated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark became the first country to give homosexual couples legal status when 
Parliament approved a gay rights bill in May by a lopsided majority. The law 
gives homosexual couples almost equal rights as heterosexual couples but bars 
them from the right to adopt children.

Kellogg Co. said it expects its third-quarter earnings to be lower than the 
same period last year due to increasing competition for ready-to-eat oat bran 
cereal, triggering a sharp fall in the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of the Battle Creek, Mich.-based cereal giant sank $2.75 to $70.875 
in heavy afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The company earned $145.7 million or $1.18 a share in the year-ago third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William La Mothe said in a 
statement that archrival General Mills continues to gain market share aided by 
growing consumer interest in oat bran, high-fiber cereal touted as a 
cholesterol reducer. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company expects an increase in earnings for the full year. Kellogg 
recently introduced Common Sense Oat Bran and is currently introducing 
nationally two new products, OatBake and HeartWise.

ZENITH CORP. SELLING COMPUTER BUSINESS TO FRENCH COMPANY

<P>
Zenith Electronics Corp. said today that it is selling its fast-growing 
computer group to the French company Groupe Bull to concentrate on consumer 
electronics, the weaker segment of its business. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith is the last major U.S.-headquartered manufacturer of televisions, a 
business that has usually lost money for the company in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zenith said in a statement that it expects the purchase price for the computer 
business to be less than $635 million, with the exact amount to be based on the 
net asset value of the computer business when the deal is closed, probably by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Glenview, Ill.-based Zenith's computer systems and components expanded 
23% to $1.6 billion last year contrasted to a 2.7% increase in 
consumer-electronics sales, which totaled $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Amount of Debt 
</P>
<P>
Despite its fast growth, Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said the computer 
business is saddled with a large amount of debt that has restricted Zenith's 
ability to realize the full potential of its consumer electronics division. 
</P>
<P>
"Zenith will emerge as a conservatively financed company better prepared to 
capitalize on our strengths in consumer electronics," Pearlman said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith said it will concentrate on "new consumer electronics and component 
technologies, particularly high-definition television and advanced 
high-resolution color displays." 
</P>
<P>
Zenith's stock surged more than $2 a share, to $16.75 from Friday's close of 
$14.50, in early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange. Pearlman 
estimated the book value of Zenith's stock after the sale at $19 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the deal represents 
good value for stockholders. He said that with the proceeds from the sale, 
Zenith could retire about $300 million of its debt load and invest heavily in 
emerging video technologies such as high-definition television and its own 
flat-mask video display, an industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned Profit Last Year 
</P>
<P>
"This takes a company in the red that was becoming quite financially shaky into 
very sound financial condition," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith spokesman John Taylor said the company had $167 million in short-term 
debt and $309 million in long-term debt at the end of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith turned a profit of $11.7 million last year -- its first annual profit in 
four years -- but had a net loss of $17 million for the first half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement marks the French company's second acquisition of a U.S. computer 
maker. In 1987 it became the major shareholder of Honeywell Bull, which took 
over the $2-billion computer business of Honeywell Inc.

A Houston lawyer best known for representing Pennzoil in its marathon court 
battle with Texaco was the nation's highest-paid lawyer in 1988, making between 
$450 million and $600 million, according to a Forbes Magazine survey released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Jamail headed the list of 134 highest-paid lawyers in the country who 
together made an imposing $860 million in 1988. The only people consistently 
making as much money as trial lawyers in America are entertainers and Wall 
Street money men, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
The top money-earners included 63 trial lawyers and 71 corporate attorneys. The 
trial lawyers averaged eight times as much money as the corporate lawyers, who 
earned an estimated $110 million. Joseph Flom, 66, senior partner at New York's 
Skadden, Arps, Meagher and Flom, earned an estimated $5 million in 1988, making 
him the highest-paid corporate lawyer in America.

Californian Al Teage pushed his streamlined racer to 392.97 m.p.h. Sunday in 
his bid to break the 24-year-old world land speed record of 409.677 m.p.h. for 
piston-engine cars. 
</P>
<P>
Teage, of San Gabriel, is one of three men hoping to eclipse the old mark 
before the 1989 World of Speed competition ends today at the Bonneville Salt 
Flats, on the Great Salt Lake Desert 100 miles west of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fastest time ever for Teage's streamliner, which had gone 384 m.p.h. 
last year. He then huddled with his mechanics in an effort to get even more 
speed out of the racer Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Teage, Nolan White of San Diego and Don Vesco of Temecula, Calif., are all 
after the record set by brothers Robert and William Summers of Omaha, Neb., at 
Bonneville in November, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
In a shakedown run Sunday, White hit 388.098 m.p.h., less than 5 m.p.h. slower 
than Teage's practice speed. But Vesco did not get an official time because a 
wind gust pushed his twin-engine car over the timing lights as the vehicle 
entered the measured mile.

Sanchez Vicario, ranked fifth in the world, began pulling away after the two 
reached 3-3 in the first set. Her opponent is ranked No. 22. 
</P>

Conchita Martinez of Spain struggled nearly three hours before downing Isabelle 
Demongeot 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. No doubles match was played. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to Japan to win. We have the confidence for it," Sanchez Vicario said.

Fourth-seeded Bulgaria blanked qualifier South Korea 3-0. In the feature match, 
Manuela Maleeva beat Im Sook-ja 6-1, 6-0.

International Boxing Federation middleweight champion Michael Nunn was arrested 
on charges of assault after a brawl involving about 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's mother, Madies Nunn, and Raymond Jones, Nunn's bodyguard, also were 
arrested Sunday by Davenport police. They were also charged with assault. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Nunn struck an officer and that his mother hit an officer with 
her shoe. They said Jones threatened an officer with an ax. 
</P>
<P>
The fight erupted about 3:30 p.m. at a Davenport street corner, and about a 
dozen officers were called. All involved were released shortly after being 
taken into custody, and police would not say what other charges were filed in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, a resident of Agoura Hills and a native of Davenport, made no comment as 
he was being led from the scene, other than to ask police to remove the 
handcuffs. "I'm cool. I'm cool," he repeated. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn later told the Quad-City Times that he was merely trying to break up the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn was in town visiting his mother, said Bob Surchein, an adviser to the 
boxer.
