1,739 TIPS IN SLAYINGS CASE; ANONYMOUS TIPSTER SURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators have received 1,739 tips in connection with the stabbing deaths 
of five women in Clairemont and University City, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At a morning press briefing, Capt. Dick Toneck said that more than half the 
leads phoned in to the San Diego Police Department "have been pursued." 
</P>
<P>
Among the more promising, in Toneck's view, was a call from a Clairemont 
resident who reported confronting a man, who fit the description of the 
suspect's composite, in his living room one morning in May. 
</P>
<P>
The caller reported that he and the man spoke briefly -- the man said he was 
looking for someone and was in the wrong apartment -- when he then turned 
around and left hurriedly. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the story is significant in that it confirms the killer's method of 
operation -- entering through an unlocked or open door in the middle of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
He said the caller is a resident at the Canyon Ridge apartment complex in the 
3100 block of Cowley Way, where Tiffany Paige Schultz -- the first victim in 
what police believe is a series of murders -- was killed Jan. 12. The second 
and third killings occurred at the Buena Vista Gardens complex, which is next 
door to Canyon Ridge and managed by the same company. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the man left a message on a Crime Stoppers' answering machine after 
the fourth and fifth murders Sept. 13 on Honors Drive in University City, but 
failed to leave a name. Toneck said the man recently called again to reaffirm 
his story and leave his name. Toneck said he believes press attention given to 
the man's anonymous call caused him to call again and leave a name. Police have 
now interviewed the man, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said he had "no idea" why the man failed to call after the incident 
reportedly happened in May, which was shortly after the stabbing death of third 
victim Holly Suzanne Tarr. 
</P>
<P>
Tarr, a high school senior from Okemos, Mich., was visiting her brother when 
she was killed in his Buena Vista Gardens apartment April 3. Immediately after 
Tarr was stabbed, a maintenance man and a painter reported seeing a 
dark-skinned man, 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with a medium build and close-cropped 
dark hair, flee the apartment. The maintenance man said the suspect ran toward 
him with a knife held over his head. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the widely distributed composite drawing of the suspect is based 
upon that sighting. University City residents later said they saw a stranger, 
who matched the description, lingering in the Honors Drive neighborhood shortly 
before the stabbing deaths of Pamela Gail Clark, 42, and her daughter Amber, 
18. 
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses have described the suspect as black; others say he might be 
Latino or Middle Eastern. But the witness who found a man in his living room 
described him as black. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're saying is that the person is definitely a black male," Toneck said 
Monday. "What . . . nationality he may be, we don't know. All we're going to 
say is that he's definitely a black male." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the Clairemont man's call is significant because "it helps us 
identify an area, although it's not the area the subject hit last time. But it 
helps narrow the (general) area to some extent" and gives police more detail 
about the suspect's method of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said the suspect was apparently "nervous enough" about police 
intervention in Clairemont that he decided to target a new area. He issued a 
warning that the suspect could strike again, at any time, in any area of the 
city or county.

PORT DISTRICT HIRES JANITORIAL FIRM FOR AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE NEW COMPANY SAYS IT WILL ATTEMPT TO HIRE BACK THE WORKERS FIRED BY 
ITS PREDECESSOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the hope of bringing labor peace to Lindbergh Field, the Board of Port 
Commissioners on Monday hired a San Francisco-based janitorial company to begin 
work Nov. 1 at the busy airport. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of American Building Maintenance Co. at a cost of about $1.4 
million a year comes almost two months after commissioners fired World Services 
Inc., which was criticized for exploiting workers and failing to live up to its 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The company was let go after being on the job for only one month. 
</P>
<P>
World Services created troubles for the San Diego Unified Port District and 
Service Employees International Union, Local 102, by firing 55 of 70 union 
janitors and refusing to negotiate with the union. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the workers had worked at the airport for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The union responded by holding three protests at Lindbergh Field, which led to 
the arrest of several union pickets. 
</P>
<P>
Both the new company and the union said Monday that they believe they can work 
together. The company, one of the largest of its kind in the country, has about 
650 workers in San Diego County and has two existing agreements with the 
service employees union on separate contracts. 
</P>
<P>
It also has five other airport janitorial contracts, including one at John 
Wayne Airport in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Harris, American Building Maintenance's San Diego manager, told the 
board his company will interview and attempt to rehire the workers fired by its 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try and use as many former employees as were there before," 
Harris said. "We feel they are valuable people who need their jobs back." 
</P>
<P>
Eliseo Medina, president of the SEIU local, was upbeat after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be able to work it out with them," he said. "The Board of Port 
Commissioners wants to it to be a good contract . . . so now the ball is in our 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lynn Schenk, who was among the most critical of the performance of 
the old contractor, said she hopes the new contract will lead to "reasonably 
good labor relations." 
</P>
<P>
She told Harris the company's work and that of its subcontractors "reflects 
back on us" at a place with such a high public profile as the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Replied Harris: "A black eye for the port is a black eye for us." 
</P>
<P>
While the contract is for one year, the Port District has the option of 
renewing it for two more years. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen companies made bids for the janitorial contract, with American 
Building Maintenance the low bidder of those accepted. Its bid of $1.369 
million was $20,000 less than the second-place finisher, CBM Industries Inc.

3 KILLED IN NAVY HELICOPTER CRASH OFF OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego-based Navy helicopter plunged into the ocean Sunday 30 miles west 
of Oregon and the three crew members are presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy SH-60B Seahawk plummeted into the ocean at 7:30 p.m. Sunday as it 
tried to make an emergency landing on the guided missile frigate Crommelin. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occured while the helicopter and Crommelin were participating in a 
joint United States-Canadian anti-submarine warfare exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The crew members were pilot Lt. Cmdr. Paul K. Miller, 36, of Elgin, Ill.; 
co-pilot Ensign Timothy E. Hanusin, 27, of Niagara Falls, N.Y., and radar 
operator Petty Officer 2nd Class William R. Nolte, 25, of Minneapolis, Minn. 
All three lived in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost three very good and talented people," said Ken Mitchell, a Navy 
spokesman for the North Island Naval Air Station, where the helicopter and crew 
were based. "Any time we lose a life, it's like you lose part of the family." 
</P>
<P>
Four Navy ships, one Canadian naval ship and a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter 
searched the area Sunday. More ships and aircraft joined the effort Monday 
before the search was abandoned at sunset. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was the first fatal helicopter crash in 1990 for the San Diego 
base, Mitchell said. In 1989, there were three helicopter accidents; two of 
them were fatal. One man was killed in each of those two accidents.

S. AFRICA PRESIDENT DE KLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again we're inured with Jessie Jackson's dogmatic love of rhetoric ("Why 
Then Embrace De Klerk?" Commentary, Sept. 27). 
</P>
<P>
By propping up Iraq President Saddam Hussein and trying to make a feeble 
comparison between two very different circumstances, Jackson shows his very 
selective racial preferences, i.e., anyone who is not white. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson states: "The world acknowledges that South Africa is a racist state." 
Jackson's mind is a "racist state," and I challenge him to show me one nation 
free of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson thinks we should "talk it out" with Hussein. If Jackson were held at 
gunpoint by a thief, would he talk it out? 
</P>
<P>
He informs us that (South Africa President Frederik) "De Klerk's security 
police are now implicated in the current violence among black South Africans." 
No, Jesse. Black tribes fight among each other like Crips and Bloods -- yet I 
trust you will continue to believe that all black peoples' sufferings are 
caused by whites. 
</P>
<P>
A die-hard liberal. I always thought that a black U.S. President would show our 
love of liberty and equality. But honestly, I have black friends who are more 
qualified for the office than this habitual demagogue.

STEELER FAN BEATEN AT RAIDERS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been an avid Raider fan since the day the team arrived from Oakland. I 
do not believe it is fair to judge all Raider fans or the Coliseum as a place 
where "hooligans" gather. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the riots that occur at English soccer matches, this was an isolated 
incident. The Los Angeles Police Department and the Coliseum security staff do 
a fine job of controlling the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly believe that new rules should be drawn up that prohibit the sale of 
any alcoholic beverages after the second quarter, and possibly permit a maximum 
of two beers per customer at all games league-wide. 
</P>
<P>
I ask that the media and everyone in general not allow "one bad apple to spoil 
the whole bunch of us."

GAY'S SUIT AGAINST BOY SCOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Timothy Curran's suit against the Boy Scouts for denying him the opportunity to 
serve as a Scout leader is a prime example of the pernicious discriminantion 
lesbians and gays suffer daily. The leadership of Mount Diablo's Boy Scouts has 
proved itself to be bigoted against Curran, by basing its assessment of his 
suitability to lead on a vicious stereotype rather than on his spotless record 
of achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The big lie here is that gay men seduce young boys. It is a stereotype 
well-known to legitimate sex researchers to be completely baseless. People who 
seduce children are pederasts, a distinct psychological designation for those 
individuals who are attracted to children. It has nothing to do with being gay 
or lesbian or heterosexual. Those who insist on perpetuating this lie are 
themselves unfit role models for the young.

DO THE SAUDIS UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM?; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. FORCES HANDCUFFED BY TRAINING RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY IMPEDE COMBAT 
CAPABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has sent tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of planes 
and tanks to Saudi Arabia, at that country's invitation, to deter Iraqi 
aggression. Monday, in his United Nations speech, President Bush again denied 
any interest in a permanent U.S. presence there, reaffirming that American 
forces will remain only so long as they are needed. How long that might be no 
one knows. But what every military commander does know is that while these 
units are in Saudi Arabia, it's vital to keep their fighting abilities honed. 
For reasons of its own, the Saudi regime seems to be insensitive to this need. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of U.S. troops now in Saudi Arabia are being denied the chance to 
train with live ammunition. This is no small thing. The conditions these forces 
face differ greatly from the home-base environments most came from. Those 
conditions -- heat, humidity, blowing sand -- can affect the accuracy and 
reliability of weapons. It's especially important for tank and artillery units 
to be able to test fire and calibrate their weapons. But the Saudis have agreed 
to make available only a single live fire range for all U.S. forces, wholly 
inadequate given the number of U.S. troops committed. As a result, says one 
commander, many fighting men "won't know how things work until the shooting 
starts." 
</P>
<P>
That is utterly and unequivocally unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of risks are the Saudis running with the military effectiveness and 
maybe even the lives of Americans sent to protect their regime? U.S. officials 
say the Saudis are concerned that unexploded shells from live-fire exercises 
could endanger desert nomads. Really? Saudi Arabia's land area is about equal 
to the United States east of the Mississippi River. It is beyond belief that in 
all this vast desert acreage no room can be found for U.S. gunners and pilots 
to test their weapons without imperiling nomadic herdsmen. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a more likely -- certainly a more plausible -- explanation for the 
Saudis' policy. The rapid buildup of U.S. and other foreign forces over the 
last seven weeks has virtually erased any chance of an Iraqi invasion. Feeling 
secure now because of the American presence, the Saudis seem little inclined to 
worry about the fighting quality of those forces. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, their secretive and xenophobic attitudes are again prevailing. They 
will keep the foreigners isolated to the greatest extent possible, even denying 
them adequate firing ranges. U.S. commanders are worried. They have every right 
to be.

GAY'S SUIT AGAINST BOY SCOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am appalled at your editorial! 
</P>
<P>
To imply that homosexuals should be afforded the opportunity to lead and 
provide example for young Boy Scouts because not all "gays" are sexually 
promiscuous or active in proselytizing "their" lifestyles is as unconscionable 
as it is absolute rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the vocal numbers of homosexuals demanding equality in all facets 
of life, I think that it is time for The Times to reflect the needs of all 
society and draw the line. The Scout director said it best, "Homosexuality and 
boy scouting are not compatible."

Being homosexual in a straight world must not be easy. We who are straight 
believe that homosexuality is truly an aberration and that we have a moral -- 
not necessarily religious -- obligation to our children to teach them by 
resolve and by example that the love between a man and a woman is the truest 
and most meaningful kind of love. 
</P>
<P>
To grant an avowed homosexual a position of authority over our youngsters 
undeniably gives legitimacy to that lifestyle. It is to be vigorously opposed.

In response to "Boy Scout Question," editorial (Sept. 24): 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial on gays becoming Scout leaders was remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
The public, in general, must break away from these fears of homosexuals. They 
are only different in their choice of a companion. 
</P>
<P>
It is truly sad that Curran has to go through the courts to become a Scout 
leader. This should prove to the courts that this man cares and wants to help 
mold minds in a proper way, not in a sexual way.

DEPUTY SHOOTS MAN ON RESERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The officer had been called about 6:30 p.m. to a family disturbance on Viejas 
Grade Road on the reservation, about three miles east of Alpine and 30 miles 
east of downtown San Diego, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, who was unidentified, was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital 
with an abdominal wound, nursing supervisor Melanie Bruce said. No report of 
his condition was available late Monday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was not hurt, deputies said. Other details of the shooting were not

worth the multimillion-dollar price tag placed on them for auction, an arts 
magazine says. Experts quoted in the October issue of ARTNews said the artwork 
is not worth the $8.6 million to $12.5 million Christies auction house 
estimated they will bring at a January auction. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan conservator Marco Grassi told the magazine that galleries sold Mrs. 
Marcos "inferior art at superior prices." The works were seized by the 
Philippine government after Marcos was ousted in 1986. Christies spokesman Ian 
Kennedy said: "I am perfectly satisfied" with the prices. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu Tribute: Archbishop Desmond Tutu says South African President F. W. de 
Klerk deserves praise for progress in dismantling apartheid. "It would be 
churlish to say that he does not deserve to be praised," Tutu said at a 
lawyers' meeting over the weekend in San Juan, Puerto Rico. But "sanctions must 
remain until the process is irreversible," said Tutu, who is leader of the 
Anglican Church of Southern Africa and winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Spy Catcher: CIA Director William Webster, often on the short list of the most 
eligible bachelors in Washington, may be about to get off the list. Webster 
reportedly is planning an Oct. 20 wedding with Lynda Jo Clugstone. She is head 
of marketing at the Watergate Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Solidified: Poland's Solidarity leader and presidential candidate Lech Walesa 
celebrated his 47th birthday and married off his oldest son on the same day. 
Bogdan Walesa, 21, wed Agnieszka Drozdowska in a crowded ceremony Saturday at a 
cathedral in Gdansk. The elder Walesa led strikes in 1980 and 1988 that 
influenced politics in Poland. Presidential elections are Nov. 25.

JACK SMITH: ART'S CRITICAL EYE UNLEASHES A WILD BEAST LURKING INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Acritic's life is a lonely one; his ethics prohibit him from keeping close 
company with those he criticizes, yet his intellectual being is in their world. 
</P>
<P>
Since their pens can destroy reputations and careers, critics are feared and 
despised. They are loved only when they praise. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the briefest review can be devastating. As Dorothy Parker wrote of a 
New York play, " 'The House Beautiful' is the play lousy." 
</P>
<P>
The actor Geoffrey Steyne is remembered only because critic Heywood Broun once 
described him as "the worst actor on the American stage." Steyne sued, but the 
case was dismissed. In his next review, Broun did not mention Steyne until the 
last sentence, which read: "Mr. Steyne's performance was not up to his usual 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
Critics, in turn, have often felt the scorn of their victims. Most often, they 
are accused of criticizing what they cannot do. The 17th-Century poet John 
Dryden wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 They who write ill, and they who never durst write, 
</P>
<P>
 Turn critics out of mere revenge and spite. 
</P>
<P>
Though he himself was an astute critic of manners and morals, Mark Twain 
dismissed criticism as "the most degraded of all trades." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Algren called criticism "the avocation of assessing the failures of 
better men." 
</P>
<P>
The French wit Tristan Bernard compared critics with "a virgin who wants to 
teach Don Juan how to make love." And the mischievous Irish playwright Brendan 
Behan said: "Critics are like eunuchs in a harem. They're there every night, 
they see it done every night, they see how it should be done every night, but 
they can't do it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Today, when paintings of the Impressionist, post-Impressionist and Fauves 
periods bring many millions of dollars at auction, it is interesting to 
discover how critics appraised these works earlier in the century. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Fenstermaker of Lakewood has sent me copies of two reviews from the Art 
World of April and May, 1917. One could hardly hope to find more vivid examples 
of the vituperative critic's style. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, neither of the reviews is signed. The first considers a turbulent 
landscape by Gauguin, which the critic calls "a degenerate work of art." He 
accuses the artist of pursuing an obsession to be different "until the most 
idiotic singularity is mistaken by him for originality. 
</P>
<P>
"Gauguin was one of these possessed persons," he goes on. "His life was a 
continuous movement from mild peculiarity to practical dementia. . . . He was 
simply stupidly different, intellectually degenerate and artistically vulgar. 
The reader need only examine carefully this 'Landscape' to see how far away 
from nature the forms were made in order to reach a 'style' that should be 
sufficiently 'different' from everything any one else ever dreamt of, to 
satisfy the egomaniacal hunger of Gauguin for notoriety. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The critic lets himself off easy by concluding: "We will not dignify this work 
by making even a superficial analysis of its stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh's self-portrait is also called a "degenerate work of art," perhaps by 
the same critic. He excuses himself at the outset: "Here we have a work of art 
which is so self-evidently a degenerate work by a degenerate artist that we 
need scarcely say anything about the inept creation." 
</P>
<P>
He does not want to let Van Gogh escape that easily, however: "It is safe to 
say that if we were to meet in our dreams such a villainous looking jailbird 
with such a deformed Neanderthal skull, degenerate ears . . . hobo beard and 
insane glare, it would certainly give us a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently the critics' opinions of these two paintings were not based on 
observation of the paintings themselves, but on photographs in "a sumptuously 
published" book of their work. Oddly, the two reviews appeared in the art 
magazine in 1917, years after both Van Gogh and Gauguin had exhibited their 
work in Paris to enthusiastic acclaim, at least by other artists. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh critic charges that the book of photographs is being "hawked about 
by dealers in ultra-modernistic art for the purpose of showing what these 
modernistic 'masters' are doing to glorify life and art and who call themselves 
'Les Fauves' -- 'The Wild Beasts!' " 
</P>
<P>
While Gauguin and Van Gogh influenced the Fauves (Matisse, Braque, Dufy and 
others) with their brilliant use of pure color, they did not call themselves 
Fauves. Both were dead when Fauvism burst on the Paris scene in 1905 and a 
critic dubbed the painters Les Fauves. (By the way Fauves paintings will be on 
exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art later this month.) 
</P>
<P>
Degenerate or not, Gauguin's and Van Gogh's paintings are now worth millions of 
dollars. The Getty Museum is said to have paid something more than $50 million 
for Van Gogh's "Irises." Ironically, though he painted hundreds of pictures, 
Van Gogh sold only one in his lifetime. In despair, he shot himself to death at 
the age of 37. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there is something degenerate about Van Gogh's self-portrait. Maybe 
that's what makes it a masterpiece.

ENTERING THE FORBIDDEN ZONE;

<P>
NUCLEAR POWER: ONE OF THE FIRST WESTERN SCIENTISTS TO VISIT THE INFAMOUS 
CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR REACTOR COMPLEX, SITE OF THE WORST NUCLEAR ACCIDENT IN 
HISTORY, COMES AWAY WITH MANY IMPRESSIONS.

CHERNOBYL, U.S.S.R. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The formalities at the checkpoint are unexpectedly brief. No identification is 
necessary, not even our heads are counted. 
</P>
<P>
We have entered the "forbidden" 30-kilometer zone (an area within about a 
19-mile radius of the ill-fated Chernobyl nuclear reactor complex) and are now 
on evacuated and highly radioactively contaminated territory. 
</P>
<P>
Our group consists of seven scientists from five Western countries and seven 
Soviet colleagues. This is the first time that foreigners have been allowed to 
freely sample soil, water or plants in the forbidden zone, and take the 
material out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
At the border of the inner zone, a still more contaminated area within a 
10-kilometer radius of the reactor, we have to change to a "dirty" bus. It is a 
rundown vehicle that only operates within the inner boundaries. One day, it 
will end up as radioactive waste at the reactor site. 
</P>
<P>
We are standing in front of Reactor No. 4, which ran out of control at 1:24 
a.m. on April 26, 1986, and is now enclosed in a sarcophagus of concrete and 
steel. The other three reactors (one is attached to the ruins, the others are a 
few yards away) are operating again. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviets still draw energy from Chernobyl, they at least have given 
up on ambitious plans to make it the world's greatest concentration of nuclear 
power production. At the time of the accident, two more reactors already were 
under construction -- the housing for one looks almost completed. 
</P>
<P>
But the building lots are now deserted. Tools lie around, huge cranes tower 
into the air. The ruins, which look almost like a memorial, will also stand 
here until time has devastated them. The three operating reactor blocks are 
projected to be shut down forever -- "as soon as possible," presumably around 
the end of 1991. The power plant area, including the 10-kilometer zone, will 
remain closed to settlers for at least 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the workers live in Slavutich, a city northeast of the plant and just 
outside the 30-kilometer zone. They get an increased salary combined with a cut 
in working time. Also, food supply and medical care are better here than 
elsewhere in the country. While people all over the Soviet Union suffer from 
increasingly short supplies, we experience abundance around the zone. 
</P>
<P>
But will these employees one day regret their decision to work at the site? 
There are still too many unknowns to give a clear answer. 
</P>
<P>
We ride to the city of Pripyat, little more than a mile from the nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
Before the accident, almost 50,000 people lived here. Now, the houses -- built 
in the boring style of modern socialistic prefabrication architecture -- are 
deserted, their doors nailed shut. 
</P>
<P>
This city, which might not have looked pleasant even when lively, is now 
totally depressing and strangely unreal. Nature has started to reclaim her 
territory. The buildings deteriorate while plants overgrow the sidewalks and 
sprout through the cracks of the street asphalt. Grass on the soccer field 
almost reaches the goal's crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
This vacated city is not a total ghost town, however. We stop in front of a 
building where we will have our lunch. We are greeted by a group of employees 
offering white towels and are welcomed by a battery of running water taps. 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance to the dining hall is a radiation detector. One member of our 
group activates it and must wash his shoes again outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
The room can hold about 250 guests. Floors and walls are covered with 
quarter-inch-thick plastic foil so they can be easily washed. Dining in this 
grotesque 
</P>
<P>
environment is not exactly fun, but the food is excellent and ample -- almost 
wasteful, not only by current Soviet standards. The Interhotels in Moscow, 
Leningrad and Kiev where I had stayed could not offer comparable quality and 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion that the opulent meals we are offered are just another Potemkin 
village put up for the foreign observer is credibly denied. This is the 
lifestyle of the forbidden zone. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Pripyat, I step into a glade. The distance to the reactor is about 2 
miles. Now, in the middle of May, it is especially beautiful. Birch trees carry 
a tender green. The forest ground is covered with wild pansies blooming in two 
forms, a common three-colored type and a rare two-colored variety without blue 
petals. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise I cannot find anything remarkable about them. I am searching for 
malformed weeds reported by some Western media as omnipresent, but I do not 
find a single one here or anywhere else. And birds, which have been reported 
absent, are frequently visible. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the vegetation seems, with few exceptions, healthy. Yet many oak trees 
seem to still fight for survival. Leaves that begin growing normally start 
rolling in certain areas of the leaf blade, creating irregular shapes -- the 
so-called monstrosities. The nuclear accident has clearly caused cellular 
damage to plants, but there is no sign of lasting genetic mutation. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the even more publicized "red forests." According to some 
magazines, woods in the vicinity of the power plant are now a glowing 
reddish-pink. These red forests are patches of pines that received a tremendous 
dose of radiation during the accident, then died. The "red forests" are dead 
forests and look like dried pines are supposed to look. 
</P>
<P>
Still, these dead forests pose seemingly unsolvable problems to the 
authorities. They need to be cut down to prevent them from becoming breeding 
places for disease, but where to put the heavily contaminated wood? 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ukraine has been suffering for years from a severe drought. 
This spring was extremely dry. Someday, the dry forest could start burning, and 
then one can only hope the wind won't carry radioactive material into populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Little House 
</P>
<P>
I notice a little house covered by young birch trees. It is surrounded by a low 
fence and several small sheds belonging to the settlement. The entrance door is 
wide open. 
</P>
<P>
The total floor space is less than 250 square feet, divided into three tiny 
rooms. One room is almost completely occupied by a huge whitewashed stone oven. 
The surroundings seem familiar. In Russian novels, I have read descriptions of 
places like this, mostly in portrayals of poverty and misery. All the windows 
are broken. The floor is strewn with personal belongings and broken housewares. 
I find photographs, letters, toys. 
</P>
<P>
In front of the house lies a child's bicycle with trampled spokes. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of this area -- and I will see many more abandoned houses like 
this one -- were evacuated by the army the day after the disaster. They left 
abruptly without having time or being allowed to take any of their belongings. 
At the time, they thought they would soon be able to return. They've never come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Later, somehow, the empty houses were looted. No one knows where all the stolen 
and often highly contaminated goods ended up. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in this small deserted and vandalized cottage, the misery caused by the 
nuclear explosion seems imminent. One senses the terror of the evacuation, even 
more than in the city of Pripyat with its unreal, Kafkaesque atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Here it becomes clear how close "nuclear war" and "the peaceful utilization of 
nuclear energy" really are. In the whole trip to Chernobyl, it was the sight of 
these small devastated forest settlements that made the greatest impression on 
me. 
</P>
<P>
In the garden, we find a tree stump covered with ants; there is almost no wood 
visible. In the center of the cut surface is a small hollow, perhaps 2 inches 
in diameter, where radioactive substances were washed by the rain and, thus, 
concentrated. The dosimeter (which registers levels of radiation absorption) 
measurements are extremely high. 
</P>
<P>
 The ants don't seem to care. They are busy performing their stately duties. 
Malformations or other abnormalities are not visible. Of course, this 
observation is of limited value. We do not know when the ants colonized the 
tree stump, nor what ants would do to malformed and possibly disabled tribe 
members. 
</P>
<P>
We decide not to stay too long -- the radiation is too intense at this spot. 
</P>
<P>
We leave the garden and continue our sampling and assessments. As a geneticist, 
I am able to restrict myself to sampling with the camera; others collect large 
amounts of contaminated specimens. 
</P>
<P>
(The scientists are expected to deliver their conclusions by the end of the 
year to the International Union of Radioecologists.) 
</P>
<P>
The safety measures we take are not uniform. We are all wearing a Soviet 
standard labor suit (with Ukrainian colors on the sleeve, unthinkable before 
glasnost) and a simple white surgeon's hat. Some of us wear gloves; others 
collect with naked hands. Cameras and other carry-ons are covered with plastic 
bags or transported without protection. 
</P>
<P>
In places where some of us wear respiration masks, others smoke. At least 10 of 
the participants are radioecologists, but among them there is no agreement on 
necessary precautionary measures. Some of our Ukrainian colleagues, who have 
been using the forbidden zone as an outdoor laboratory for years, are 
especially careless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The City in Fear 
</P>
<P>
Kiev, a city of 2.3 million inhabitants situated about 75 miles south of 
Chernobyl, seems much cleaner than Moscow or Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
After the reactor accident, the city was washed daily with water-spraying 
trucks. Since the heavy equipment remains and since, under communistic 
bureaucracy, it is difficult to stop what is already in motion, the daily 
rinses continue. 
</P>
<P>
Kiev's beautiful parks and chestnut trees are flowering everywhere at this time 
of year. The streets are crowded until late at night. 
</P>
<P>
In Revolution Plaza, young people are on a hunger strike to demand a stronger 
stand by Moscow against the rulers of China. "For the Dead of Tian An Men 
Square" is written on their banners. 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed Ukrainian parliament holds its first meeting, where a strong 
radical opposition clashes with the political Establishment. Thousands of 
interested citizens listen to the proceedings in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement is misleading, however. Many people are depressed. There is a 
severe shortage of food, and prospects for the future are dark. And, again and 
again, there is Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
Fear is everywhere. Almost everyone has a story to tell about the neighbor's 
child who suddenly fell ill of leukemia and died. Everything that can be 
connected to the reactor accident is seen as a definite consequence of it, even 
if the circumstances speak against such an interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Official government statements regarding the incident are not believed by the 
citizens: "Nobody is telling us the truth. What will happen to our children? 
What if the dead forests start burning?" 
</P>
<P>
The distrust of "those in Moscow" is deep among Ukrainians. Nuclear power 
plants are placed under the control of the nation's central administration and 
out of the hands of the individual republics. That is why the accident was 
handled by the authorities in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Mistakes were made. Situations were badly misjudged. False information was 
frequently distributed. But most important, in spite of the many heroic efforts 
and the tremendous amount of money spent, there was still not enough financial 
backing for the cleanup. There remains a permanent shortage of resources of all 
kinds. The administration is normally overburdened by lesser challenges; this 
one was many orders of magnitude too difficult for the ossified government 
apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, I observe statistical data that seem to 
support the assertion that the reactor meltdown has had no detectable effect on 
the population's health. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is an obvious trend toward a general decrease of people's 
health. This deleterious tendency, which was kept secret until recently, began 
eight to 10 years ago. Cited reasons are deficient medical care, insufficient 
nourishment and various environmental stresses. 
</P>
<P>
Effects of the Chernobyl accident are not visible, not even in the case of 
children's leukemia. The data does not prove the people's view wrong -- far 
more research is needed -- but it does not at this stage support this 
contention. The infant death rate, which remains high, has actually decreased 
due to mandatory infant examinations ordered after the nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean the consequences of the accident were not all that bad after 
all? 
</P>
<P>
By no means. The reactor meltdown has caused unthinkable misery and nobody 
knows how much more it will bring. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions of the number of people who will die of Chernobyl-related cancer 
within the next 20 years are often ideologically tainted (on both extremes) and 
scientifically irresponsible. Too little is known about the health-damaging 
effects of irradiation, although there are scientific reasons to be more 
careful and to reduce the current exposure limits for people working with 
radioisotopes. 
</P>
<P>
Our visit to Chernobyl, although not always in accordance with Western press 
reports, surpassed the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
A holocaust does not need exaggeration. Who can conceive the inferno of the 
evacuation in a city like Pripyat or in the forests surrounding the plant? 
Enormous resettlements, affecting more people than have been resettled to date, 
apparently are still necessary and indeed planned for the near future, 
especially in Byelorussia. 
</P>
<P>
We left Kiev for Chernobyl on an early Monday morning and returned to the 
capital on Wednesday. During that time, I was exposed to about 6 millirems. 
This is about six times the normal dose, or a little less than I received on my 
flight from Los Angeles to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
That is, the journey to Chernobyl caused at least twice the exposure of the 
visit to the forbidden zone itself. But this doesn't diminish the danger of 
visiting the accident site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On May 14, UC Irvine plant geneticist Franz J. Hoffmann became one of the first 
Western scientists to visit the infamous Chernobyl nuclear reactor complex, 
site of the worst nuclear accident in history. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Ukraine republic had invited scientists because they do not 
trust the official government pronouncements about the hazards, Hoffmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old cell biologist found no evidence of genetic damage or horrific 
mutations in his three days in the so-called "forbidden zone" surrounding the 
damaged reactor. But there is abundant evidence of serious cell damage to 
plants, as well as extremely high radiation levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was the mute testimony of fallen bicycles, evacuated houses that had 
been ransacked for valuables, normal lives forever disrupted by an explosion in 
the night, that left him shocked and overwhelmed by the enormity of the 
Chernobyl disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The landscape is so contaminated that it cannot be settled for at least 100 
years. Containment efforts have been so inadequate that a concrete-and-lead 
shell encasing the damaged reactor is sinking of its own weight and another 
must be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visiting Chernobyl won't make you an opponent of nuclear energy, 
necessarily," he said. "But it makes you think about it more carefully than 
before."

LEARNING TO DODGE THE PARKING LOT DODGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed your column (Joseph Bell, Aug. 24) this morning. The parking lot 
dodge has irritated me for decades. We had a 1965 black-and-silver Porsche 
years back that we didn't let anyone else drive, not even tux-wearing 
parking-lot parasites. 
</P>
<P>
At a Century City affair about 25 years back, we pulled up to let my wife out 
at a hotel door. The parking lot honcho wanted to take over. "No way," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you'll have to take care of me," the parking parasite insisted. I gave 
him a five and parked the bomb myself. 
</P>
<P>
The last few years, a certain Dana Point restaurant has swarmed with beady-eyed 
parking lot pests. We foil the greedy, grasping goofs by arriving early. If we 
ever arrive when the lot is filling up, I'll get my binoculars out of the trunk 
and pretend to be enjoying the view. While the leeches are victimizing some 
other innocents, we'll slip into the restaurant.

REBECCA HORN CLOBBERS CONVENTION

<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major exhibition for German artist Rebecca Horn opened Sunday at the Museum 
of Contemporary Art on Bunker Hill. It should upset a regular apple cart of 
conventional expectations. Imagine the apple cart as a self-propelled robot 
full of slightly kinky mechanical passion fruit and you begin to get the idea. 
The artist is little known in these parts, although widely recognized in Europe 
and New York. She is a performance artist-sculptor-filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Uh-oh. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about those multiple monicker occupations that immediately causes us 
to catch a whiff of the flaky poseur who does many things badly? And Horn's 
roles are so contradictory. Despite the recognition of performers like Laurie 
Anderson and Rachel Rosenthal, the generic performance artist is still 
stereotyped as an underground animal acting for voyeurs in scruffy lofts and 
being denied NEA grants for having amorous relations with jars of lard. The 
only way for such an imagined archetype to be a filmmaker is with an 8mm camera 
trained on themselves. Betcha the "sculptor" part comes from the performer's 
dippy fantasy that by putting on a leotard he/she is "sculpting" his/her body. 
It seems all those slashes just mean we live in a society that can't make up 
its mind. 
</P>
<P>
OK, now try this on for art-and-culture shock. Horn's exhibition consists of 18 
motor-driven sculptures that are more inventive, funny, apt and ominous than 
any kinetic art seen here in years. Horn's tatty little home movie is a 
two-hour color feature called "Buster's Bedroom." It was shot by the Academy 
Award-winning Sven Nykvist, stars Donald Sutherland and Geraldine Chaplin, and 
has a screenplay by Martin Mosebach and Horn, who also (puff) directed. 
</P>
<P>
Which serves to remind us here in the land of the decreasingly free that they 
can do things a little differently in Europe. In the '60s, Andy Warhol made 
considerable strides in busting the border between U.S. fine visual arts and 
the commercial film, but it didn't take. Today, the spheres remain more divided 
than the two Berlins of old. But in Berlin and elsewhere on the Continent, it's 
perfectly natural for a performance artist like Horn to know film people like 
Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders as part of a yeasty artistic stew that takes in 
writers and intellectuals as well. While we tend to specialize and 
commercialize, they can still hybridize for infusions of vigor. 
</P>
<P>
Not that "Buster's Bedroom" is a perfect movie. Its tone is set when we see the 
ingenue film student, Micha (Amanda Ooms), driving her convertible across the 
desert toward Hollywood, blindfolded. The impression she is a little nuts is 
reinforced by her habit of playing mumbletypeg very fast between her 
black-leather-gloved fingers. Her main obsession, however, is Buster Keaton. 
When she learns he was once incarcerated in an upscale loony bin called Nirvana 
House, she sets off on a pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the hospital's only doctor has expired from an overdose and the six 
inmates have taken over the asylum. They are mostly old silent-movie people 
rendered unglued by the talkies. They love Nirvana House, where they are free 
to be crazy in bedraggled luxury. An aging grande dame talks to butterflies she 
keeps in the armoire. One old boy dresses as a bee and another plays gardener 
looking for a place to plant the doctor's body. Sutherland is a snake freak. He 
ministers oddly to Chaplin, who is confined to an automatic wheelchair with a 
mechanical arm that periodically gives her a slug of whiskey. When Micha shows 
up, the loonies mistake her for an inspection committee they fear will shut the 
place down. Sutherland poses as the dead head resident trying to get rid of the 
girl while falling love with her. 
</P>
<P>
The slapstick-surreal plot unfolds to a somewhat murky conclusion where Micha 
may be dead, drowning or liberated. The film always looks beautiful, thanks to 
Nykvist. The cast, including Valentina Cortese, David Warrilow, Taylor Mead, 
Ari Snyder, Martin Wuttke and Mary Woronov, is unfailingly entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
But flaws are serious and point an accusing finger at the director-writer. The 
film lacks cohesion -- there's too much air in it. Story points are dropped and 
symbolism often obscure. Special effects that are supposed to be magical are 
merely mechanical, so we're unwilling to suspend disbelief, as in a scene where 
Chaplin chases Ooms in her wheelchair, cracking a bullwhip. Cocteau or Bunuel 
might have brought this off, but here we just realize the girl has nothing to 
fear, even before Chaplin falls in the swimming pool. For all its professional 
troops, "Buster's Bedroom" still smacks of amateurism. 
</P>
<P>
So much said, the film is still five times more interesting than your average 
Hollywood potboiler. It's to be screened twice weekly until the show closes 
Jan. 6. Intelligent and seriously intended, it deals with the asylum as a 
double symbol of lunacy and art. The neurotic Micha has to think twice when 
faced by real psychos. Does she really want to slip into their world of 
fantasy? It seems as free as childhood but once you're in it, it's prison. 
Nirvana House doubles for the art world, where people pay a price in 
obsessiveness to achieve their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Bristling with kinks and fetishes, it borders on having sheer compulsiveness as 
its main theme. To its credit, it avoids leanings toward Teutonic 
whips-'n'-leather sadomasochism. Finally, Micha meets boy and they escape -- or 
almost. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is compelling just by the bewitching nature of the medium, but the 
exhibition is a more complete artistic success. Horn sees Buster Keaton as a 
kind of alter ego, with his incredible mechanical ingenuity and pathetic 
persona. He goes through hell to get the girl and winds up kissing the dog. 
That kind of absurdity comes through best in the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
It consists mainly of props from the movie or free-standing works inspired by 
it. The introductory piece, "Times Goes By," is a direct homage to Buster 
Keaton, with its reams of film and Keatonesque Oxfords. The exhibition title, 
"Diving Through Buster's Bedroom," derives from Chaplin's plunge into the pool. 
In the main gallery, Horn does a magical job of making us feel under water, 
using reflections bounced from a mirrored pool by strong stage lights. The 
empty wheelchair circles, periodically stopping for a slug from its Dr. 
Strangelove arm. The piano floats from the ceiling, quiet until its guts 
explode with a musical diminuendo. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a fan of sheet music opens and closes -- the show's most delicate 
lyric. Sutherland's snakes inspired works that include a long low black box 
containing a rivulet of mercury that shudders ominously at passersby. 
</P>
<P>
On one wall a pair of mechanical arms scrub the surface black with copper 
brushes. It alludes to a moment when Sutherland brushes Chaplin's hair with 
manic tenderness. You don't have to know that to appreciate how incredibly 
lifelike mechanical motion can become. A motorized blue butterfly on the old 
film queen's bed is eerily convincing and when the nurses' blue shoes tap-dance 
all by themselves, you look around for the invisible girls. 
</P>
<P>
German art and crafts have a long history of fascination with robotics from 
mechanical dolls to Frankenstein, a flesh-and-blood robot. In Horn's work, 
creepiness, absurdity and affection go hand in hand. All come from man's 
exalted, mad notion that he can create life without nature's help. 
</P>

'JACKSON': THAT RARE SHOW WITH A POINT OF VIEW; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THOUGH THE HOST IS STILL OVERBEARING, 'JESSE JACKSON' BRINGS FRESH 
EYES AND NEW ISSUES TO PUBLIC-AFFAIRS PROGRAMMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson is better at using the camera than talking to it. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his new weekly series airing at 5 p.m. Sundays on KCAL Channel 9 -- and 
named, of all things, "Jesse Jackson" -- ranks among the most important 
additions to television in years. 
</P>
<P>
Not because Jackson has sharpened his enunciation. On the contrary, for someone 
known for swaying crowds with fiery oratory, he often slurs his words so badly 
that it takes all your concentration just to understand what he's saying. 
</P>
<P>
Not because he's skilled at interviewing and leading panel discussions. He 
isn't, as evidenced by Sunday's taped premiere, which focused almost entirely 
on the status of North American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Not because his syndicated series is silky smooth. It has kinks galore, 
including an eclectic audience that didn't participate in Sunday's show or even 
make a sound. It was nothing more than a multiracial backdrop, a prop. 
</P>
<P>
Not because he totally sheds his self-serving, personal-puffery cloak. He said 
Sunday that the Mohawks protesting plans for a golf course on their ancient 
burial grounds in Oka, Quebec, "invited us there to hear their story." So . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cut to Jackson being refused entry to the area by Canadian troops. Cut to 
Jackson holding an impromptu press conference there. Cut to Jackson visiting a 
Mohawk "survivor school." Cut to Jackson receiving a sweat shirt from the 
Mohawks. Cut to Jackson making a speech to them. Cut to Jackson with Canada's 
Indian minister, who tells Jackson that he warned the local mayor "not to go 
ahead with the golf course." Was the story the Mohawks' protest . . . or 
Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
What gives "Jesse Jackson" so much promise is obviously none of the above. What 
you love about it are its fresh eyes. 
</P>
<P>
It's Jackson the reformer, not Jackson the performer, who stars here. Thanks to 
him, this show swims against the TV mainstream by giving voice to the voiceless 
in a medium known for its narrow range of opinion in news and public-affairs 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Just think about it. Rarely do Indians get more than sound bites. But on 
Sunday, they got almost the entire hour, including a 15-minute package in which 
Indian activist Russell Means (who led the Wounded Knee uprising in South 
Dakota in 1973) visited three reservations where Indians in the United States 
were said to be facing problems similar to those in Oka. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the Earth described by American Indians as "our mother" puts many of 
their conflicts with whites in context, and these visual essays with Means were 
an eloquent expression of the Indian outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Jackson leading a panel discussion that included a treaties attorney, 
Means and two other Indian leaders. The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs 
declined to participate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In light of this, and the discussion's strong tilt, Jackson should have been a 
better devil's advocate. Yet "Jesse Jackson" is intended to have a point of 
view, and the Indian views expressed here -- charges ranging from whites 
trampling on Indian rights to institutionalized stereotyping -- are valid ones 
generally excluded from TV. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its flaws, "Jesse Jackson" promises to be strikingly distinctive and 
valuable, affirming this time that there's more than one civil rights struggle 
in the U.S.

'Roseanne' Stays Put: Cancel the moving vans. Roseanne Barr and company will be 
staying in Tinseltown for a while, instead of moving to Minneapolis next year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Barr and her husband, Tom Arnold, announced they wanted out of 
tabloid-infested Los Angeles, and would move production of ABC's "Roseanne" to 
Minneapolis. But a statement released by the Carsey-Werner Co. with Barr and 
Arnold said that after exploring the move the couple found the costs "too 
prohibitive for the 1991-92 season." They said they plan to look into moving in 
the future.

STARTING OVER: Cagney misses Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Gless says her new CBS series, "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," is "more 
difficult" than her former "Cagney &amp; Lacey" cop show. 
</P>
<P>
Gless played policewoman Chris Cagney, Tyne Daly her partner, Mary Beth Lacey. 
They won six best actress Emmys between them. Now Gless is a public defender in 
the hourlong "Rosie O'Neill." 
</P>
<P>
"Tyne carried half the load before," says Gless. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day I started the new show, I put Cagney aside and was into Rosie. 
Then I got this huge yellow balloon and a card from Tyne that said 'From Your 
Partner,' and I just started crying and realized I missed her." 
</P>
<P>
Gless says she still gets edgy when the national ratings arrive on Tuesdays: 
She remembers how CBS canceled "Cagney &amp; Lacey" early in its run -- until 
an outpouring of letters from viewers helped bring it back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stay," she says. 
</P>
<P>
STAYING ALIVE: The ratings for "Roseanne" show slippage in the first two weeks 
of the new season -- but it still gets dynamite demographics. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the series drew only 26% of the audience last week compared to 25% 
for a competing special from "Matlock" -- which stars Andy Griffith as a lawyer 
-- "Roseanne" got the viewers that TV executives yearn for: young women and 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, "Roseanne" got them in droves -- 41% of women 18-34 years old, 45% 
of teens and 39% of children 2-11. "Matlock," meanwhile, got the 50-and-older 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
When it's time to sell "Roseanne" into the rerun market, its demographics will 
be perfect for syndication's most profitable hours -- late afternoon and early 
evening, when children control TV viewing and sitcom repeats are dominant. 
</P>
<P>
RULES OF THE GAME: "L.A. Law," of course, won over "Twin Peaks" for best drama 
series at the Emmy Awards. But there's a rather interesting footnote. 
</P>
<P>
The panel of jurors that voted the award wasn't shown all of the "Twin Peaks" 
entry -- the two-hour pilot. 
</P>
<P>
That is confirmed by John Leverence, awards director of the Academy of 
Television Arts &amp; Sciences, which presents the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
Leverence says a "special rule" for program entries limits them to "the 
standard running time for a series episode." The competing dramas were weekly 
one-hour shows. 
</P>
<P>
According to Leverence, the "Twin Peaks" office was informed of the situation 
and "they said they felt the best work they had done was on the pilot." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
A producer who served on the panel said he and another producer-juror looked at 
each other in disbelief when the truncated "Twin Peaks" pilot was begun well 
into the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" was totally shut out on the national, prime-time Emmy telecast. 
</P>
<P>
ONE MORE TIME: "The Steve Allen Show" of 1956-60 was as funny as any series in 
TV history, with a classic ensemble that included Tom Poston, Don Knotts and 
Louis Nye. 
</P>
<P>
And that's a good reason to demand that your cable company carry the new Ha! 
comedy channel -- because this week, 100 segments of the Allen series will 
become part of the daily program mix. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm glad about is that all the guys have had good success in their 
careers," says Allen. "I don't think they got credit for how brilliant they 
were as a group. I sent them all fan letters three weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
Poston, who recently wound up a long run as handyman George Utley on "Newhart," 
is right back at work. 
</P>
<P>
He does voice-overs, he played Cap'n Andy in a Sacramento production of "Show 
Boat" -- and this Sunday he joins Fox's new sitcom "Good Grief" as a con artist 
who's the minister in a mortuary, the setting of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so content with the 'Newhart' experience, I had no difficulty with the 
show going off," says Poston. "I've always said I'd be willing to go into the 
twilight with Bob Newhart because I would work with him on absolutely 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
ABOUT FACE: If the early season blossoming of Gerald McRaney's "Major Dad" 
holds up, the show could be a key player in CBS' comeback attempt -- useful in 
any number of places throughout the schedule to help the network build comedy 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC: Carol Burnett's 30-minute anthology may expand to an hour 
for a November comedy special with music, featuring Hal Linden and Bernadette 
Peters. "I don't know why we should limit ourselves," says Burnett. Hmmm. The 
old Burnett series on CBS was an hour of comedy-variety and lasted 12 years and 
. . . well, just thinking. 
</P>
<P>
DOUBLE TAKE: Now, let's see -- wasn't NBC the network that didn't believe in 
"dramedy" and canceled "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" because it fit into 
that part-drama, part-comedy mold? Well, then, what was Saturday's episode of 
Ed Begley's new NBC series, "Parenthood"? And what is NBC's new "American 
Dreamer"? 
</P>
<P>
NEW FACE: Kim Devore, who'll join Ross Becker as co-anchor of KCOP Channel 13, 
is a local product -- Beverly Hills High, USC. She replaces Wendy Rutledge Oct. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
HEAVY HITTER: To realize the huge impact of last week's five-part series, "The 
Civil War," consider that PBS usually gets only 3% of the prime-time audience. 
"The Civil War" averaged 13% -- an increase of more than 400%. On the final 
night, Thursday, the Ken Burns series pulled an astonishing 21% of San 
Francisco TV viewers. Los Angeles: 11%.

'DUMPING GROUND' POINTS FINGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Global Dumping Ground" is a first-class investigative piece on environmental 
criminals and the nations -- including the Unites States -- whose policies 
appear to encourage them. 
</P>
<P>
On this program, and in this context, recycling is a dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Investigative Reporting began unearthing this stinking scandal 
several years ago, and with tonight's season-opening "Frontline" documentary 
(at 9 on Channel 28, 10 p.m. on Channels 24 and 50), the probe reaches a 
resounding resonance. Bill Moyers is the correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
"Global Dumping" is as clear and incisive as a documentary gets. The culprits 
in this junk-exporting scenario, according to this production of the 
investigative reporting group and KQED-TV in San Francisco, range from two New 
York brothers who made a fortune selling America's toxic garbage to Third World 
nations, to the U.S. government, which lacks the regulatory will to curtail 
toxic waste traffic that is as profitable for some U.S. businesses as it is 
sometimes smelly. 
</P>
<P>
The now-imprisoned Colbert brothers "are to hazardous waste what the James 
brothers were to bank robbery," former federal prosecutor James DeVita says 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically pioneers . . . in the surplus recycling business," Charles 
Colbert tells producer Lowell Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, in fact, the Colberts are in jail not for exporting toxic 
waste -- there is no U.S. law prohibiting that -- only for selling it as 
dry-cleaning fluid. 
</P>
<P>
They got the toxic material from U.S. companies that preferred selling it 
cheaply or giving it to the Colberts than paying the expensive cost of 
disposal. Thus, everyone profits. And, Colberts or no Colberts, the global 
dumping goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to polluted Taiwan, where children near an auto battery recycling plant 
register high lead levels and perform poorly in school. Smashed up for their 
lead and usable scrap, the used batteries came from the United States, where 
they are not even classified as toxic waste. Tell that to the children downwind 
from the smelter. 
</P>
<P>
We're told tonight that even though environmentally ravaged Taiwan now wants to 
stop importation of dangerous toxic materials, it's still being urged by the 
U.S. government to let in the U.S. waste and scrap materials that the Taiwanese 
say are hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are no straight answers here from the Environmental Protection 
Agency, leaving the impression that global dumpers are simply too powerful 
politically for the U.S. government to want to stop them. HOWARD ROSENBERG

CITY COUNCIL OKS POLICY FOR ORMOND BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in about a month, the Oxnard City Council has delayed 
adoption of a General Plan, formulated to guide development in the city for the 
next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council did vote Monday on a long-debated issue in the plan -- 
unanimously approving a policy to guide development in the Ormond Beach area in 
the southwest corner of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Monday to delay approval of the entire document, 
called the 2020 General Plan, for at least a week to give city staff members 
time to meet with a housing rights group that says the plan does not provide 
enough low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
The 2020 General Plan, which has been under consideration or revision for the 
past four years, allows for an increase of 13,462 housing units and could add 
73,768 jobs. About 2,000 of those units would be set aside for low-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The previous decision to delay adoption occurred Aug. 31 when the council voted 
to put off discussing the plan for one month until a council member returned 
from a three-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The council began to consider the plan Friday and Monday, and it is expected to 
meet again today to address some remaining unresolved issues. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel Lopez suggested delaying adoption of the plan after the 
council was told that about 300 residents from a housing rights group called 
Via Campesina were scheduled to protest before the council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez suggested that the council not take action on the plan until City Manager 
Vernon Hazen can meet with a representative of the group. The council will 
continue discussions today. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting between the two has been tentatively scheduled for Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Cortes, president of Via Campesina, said she was disappointed the 
council did not meet Monday night to hear the group's concerns. "Usually you 
keep a schedule and you don't break it unless someone dies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cortes said the 300 residents will not be able to gather for today's meeting 
because most of them work during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Via Campesina has worked alongside the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. to 
develop farm-worker housing in Moorpark and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
The Ormond Beach policy that was adopted Monday will call for the restoration 
of two miles of blighted beachfront land, the preservation of about 131 acres 
of wetlands and the construction of about 4,100 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the early debate over the General Plan focused on Ormond Beach because 
it includes some of the last remaining undeveloped beachfront acreage in the 
county. It also includes sensitive wetlands that for years have coexisted 
uneasily with nearby heavy industry and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Co., an Orange County development firm that owns about 1,000 acres 
in the Ormond Beach area, proposed three years ago to develop a 3,000-acre 
project that would have included 10,500 houses, two hotels, two golf courses, 
two shopping centers and a boardwalk along a marina with 16,000 to 18,000 boat 
slips. 
</P>
<P>
However, Baldwin scaled down its project after the city heard testimony about 
safety concerns from the nearby missile-testing center at Point Mugu and 
environmentalists who support the preservation of the wetlands protested.

On Monday, the council adopted a policy requiring Baldwin to preserve the 
wetlands, to open public access to the beach and to help buy out an aluminum 
recycling company that many environmentalists believe is poisoning the waters 
in the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
While the Ormond Beach policy was supported by several speakers, including 
nearby residents, a Chamber of Commerce representative and local surfers, it 
did not win the support of local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Roma Armbrust, chairwoman of the Ormond Beach Observers, a group dedicated to 
the preservation of the wetlands, said that before the city adopts an Ormond 
Beach policy, it should call for a meeting of representatives from the State 
Coastal Commission, the city staff, local biologists, residents and other 
interested groups to discuss the needs of the area further. 
</P>
<P>
Armbrust called the beach the "jewel in the crown of Oxnard" and said that "we 
want everybody heard together to provide a model for the rest of the coastal 
communities."

WHAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR GALLEGLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of months ago Rep. Elton Gallegly wrote to a newspaper implying he is 
proud of his congressional voting record. But what has he really done for his 
constituents? 
</P>
<P>
He did not bring home one cent of our hard-earned tax dollars for federal 
projects, which could have provided jobs, increased revenues for federal 
projects, which could have provided jobs, increased revenues for local business 
and stimulated local economies. 
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of senior citizens, his voting record shows that time and again 
he was not looking out for their best interests. This was also viewed by the 
National Council of Senior Citizens, which gave him a 7% out of 100% average 
rating for his first three years in office. As an example, in 1988, he voted to 
lower funding for senior meals, programs, employment, transportation and senior 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
If he is so interested in tougher laws in regard to the war on drugs, why did 
he vote against a law to help law enforcement track down billions of dollars of 
poison profits of drug lords who send money out of the country by international 
wire transfer? Is it because he gets campaign contributions from big banking 
interests who are opposed to this bill? 
</P>
<P>
I think he needs to take a closer look at his voting record and then answer, 
what accomplishments, Congressman Gallegly?

MAN HURT AS TRUCK CAB COMES LOOSE

<P>
A freak truck accident triggered by a dog in traffic left a 19-year-old Oxnard 
man hospitalized in serious condition Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ismael Espinoza had to be cut out of the truck's tilt-cab, which flipped 
forward on Etting Road in Oxnard when the driver tried to stop for the dog and 
crashed roof-first into a 50-foot-high telephone pole, a California Highway 
Patrol spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Espinoza was a passenger in the empty flatbed truck that he and his cousin, 
Miguel Espinoza of Oxnard, had recently painted and were returning to its 
owner, Officer Jim O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Espinoza, 22, was driving east on Etting Road about 12:40 p.m. when the 
dog darted into his path near Hailes Road. He was traveling at about 30 m.p.h., 
which normally would have been slow enough to brake without difficulty, 
O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
But the latches on the truck's tilt-cab were not secure, and the momentum of 
braking flipped the cab forward, so the windshield ended up parallel to the 
road surface at bumper-high level, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
With the driver unable to steer or apply the brakes, and its occupants staring 
down at asphalt, the truck veered off the roadway and the right side of the 
roof sliced through a telephone pole and collapsed onto Ismael Espinoza, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers took more than an hour to free the semiconscious passenger, 
whose right leg was broken and deeply cut by the wreckage, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Ismael Espinoza was in an intensive care unit at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center after surgery to reattach severed leg arteries, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Espinoza was treated for minor injuries at the same hospital and 
released. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

POLICE CHIEF RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens has returned home from the hospital, where he 
was rushed last week after his heart apparently stopped beating, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, 59, was fitted with a permanent pacemaker Thursday, said his physician, 
Dr. S.N. Charles Cho. 
</P>
<P>
He was released from St. John's Regional Medical Center on Saturday, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is in good condition, and he's in good spirits," Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, who joined the Oxnard Police Department more than 20 years ago, may be 
able to resume his duties in one to two weeks, Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens collapsed Sept. 23 after returning from a conference. Cho said he and 
cardiologists believe a cold virus had infected and inflamed Owens' heart 
muscle, causing it to stop functioning correctly. CAROL WATSON

TIGHTER PLAN SOUGHT FOR VENTURA BLVD.; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: COUNCILMAN WOO WANTS THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO STOP OR DOWNSIZE 
PROJECTS ALONG THE CORRIDOR THAT THREATEN TO CLOG SPECIFIC INTERSECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo told leaders of homeowner groups Monday 
that he wants to tighten up the Ventura Boulevard specific plan to halt 
development at the boulevard's most traffic-choked intersections. 
</P>
<P>
Woo warned, however, that any far-reaching changes in the plan as it now stands 
might increase the difficulty of passing the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who represents portions of Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks and Studio 
City, is one of three members of the council's Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee, which is scheduled to review the plan today. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which has been under study for five years, is designed to limit 
future commercial development along the Ventura Boulevard corridor from 
Cahuenga Pass to Woodland Hills, often called the Valley's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Woo and his staff said they want to determine if the city's Department of 
Transportation is empowered -- or can be empowered by the Ventura plan -- to 
stop or downsize a particular development along the boulevard when it threatens 
to create unmanageable traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"My intention is to ask the city attorney's office if we can stop development 
at 'F level' intersections, or what additional mitigation measures we can get," 
Woo told a dozen leaders of homeowner groups from Sherman Oaks, Encino, 
Tarzana, Woodland Hills and Studio City. Intersections are designated "F level" 
by city traffic engineers when they produce traffic jams large enough to spill 
over and clog neighboring intersections. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the Ventura Boulevard plan does not provide a specific mechanism 
to slow or stop development at particular intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would permit 8.6 million square feet of additional commercial 
development, increasing by 44% the 19 million square feet that exists now and 
generating 30,000 more auto trips on the boulevard during the peak afternoon 
rush hour, bringing the total to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, commercial property developers would pay hefty fees to the city 
that would be used to finance a nearly $200-million remake of the boulevard to 
cope with the load, ranging from widening the street to installing left-turn 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
But Woo also said he did not want to jeopardize a speedy enactment of the 
complicated specific plan by proposing major reforms that would require more 
study and possibly more votes to approve. 
</P>
<P>
Woo also said he will consider introducing a separate 90-day moratorium on 
Ventura Boulevard development, to take effect after enactment of the specific 
plan, to give city officials time to acquaint themselves with the plan's 
intricacies so they do not mistakenly approve projects not permitted by it. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we have some moratorium in place," Woo said, "we'll have all those 
projects rushing ahead, trying to beat the city's ability to implement the 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
A moratorium "would send out a really tough message," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of Encino and Sherman Oaks homeowner groups said they wanted 
to strengthen the height restrictions of the proposed plan, ban temporary 
advertising signs and make it more difficult to close alleys. 
</P>
<P>
But Woo warned them that altering the plan too much might trigger a provision 
of city law requiring that the plan be approved by 10 votes in the City Council 
instead of the normal eight-vote majority. 
</P>
<P>
If the city's planning director declares that the planning committee has 
recommended a plan significantly different from what the Planning Commission 
approved, he may disapprove it -- a move that would require 10 council votes to 
override.

CHANGE CONSIDERED IN FLOOD-PLAIN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors may change the county's flood-plain ordinance to 
require that mobile homes be elevated when they are installed in parks to 
prevent flood damage. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors will consider amending the ordinance Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance change would apply to mobile homes at parks in flood-hazard 
locations in the unincorporated area. 
</P>
<P>
According to the revised ordinance, floors must be elevated one foot above the 
ground. If they are not, the chassis must be placed on supporting foundations 
three feet above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The change will bring the ordinance in line with what the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency already requires to prevent excessive loss from flooding. 
</P>
<P>
The county flood ordinance now has no elevation requirements for mobile homes 
in parks. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance change would not affect mobile homes already in parks in 
flood-plain areas, unless they suffer significant damage in a flood, said Bill 
Haydon, senior engineer for the county public works agency. Then, the home must 
meet elevation requirements after repairs are made. JANE HULSE

MAYOR PEREZ BACKS DAVIS FOR SUPERVISOR

<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark Mayor Bernardo Perez on Monday announced his support of Simi Valley 
City Councilman Bill Davis for 4th District supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said there were several factors considered in his decision to endorse 
Davis over his opponent and council colleague, Vicky Howard, in the Nov. 6 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said that because Davis at one time operated an electronics business in 
Moorpark, he "knows firsthand about our community problems." 
</P>
<P>
Perez said he was also impressed that Davis played an instrumental role in 
getting a measure passed by Simi Valley voters in June that gives more priority 
to developers who plan to build affordable housing for low-income seniors. 
</P>
<P>
He said Davis' stated commitment to provide trained paramedics at Ventura 
County fire stations in Moorpark and Simi Valley was another consideration in 
his decision to endorse the candidate. Residents of both cities have repeatedly 
complained of slow response time by Pruner Ambulance Service, the east county's 
only private ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just extremely happy," Davis said of Perez's support. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has also been endorsed by the Ventura County Professional Firefighters' 
Assn. and the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Howard is backed by Ventura County Sheriff John Gillespie, Dist. Atty. Michael 
D. Bradbury and the Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District includes Moorpark, Simi Valley, Somis and the Santa Clara 
Valley. CARLOS V. LOZANO

LAWMAKERS HESITANT TO ENDORSE DEFICIT-REDUCTION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bipartisan majority of San Fernando Valley-area lawmakers recoiled Monday 
from the sweeping deficit-reduction package hammered out by President Bush and 
congressional leaders, with only Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) 
embracing it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's plenty of things in there for everyone to dislike," said Rep. Carlos 
J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), who expressed particular concern about the impact on 
the elderly. "As a conservative, I'm not likely to vote for this thing." 
</P>
<P>
The negative initial reaction of the other area legislators spanned the 
political spectrum from Moorhead and fellow Republican Elton Gallegly of Simi 
Valley to liberals Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
While leaders of both parties said Monday that a majority of their members are 
ready to vote for the package, the reluctance among Valley lawmakers reflects 
the difficult task ahead for the leadership and the White House in selling it. 
</P>
<P>
One of those involved in the sales process is Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), 
who heads the House Republican Conference. The veteran lawmaker stopped short 
of endorsing the package of tax increases and spending cuts and called it "much 
stronger than I had hoped." 
</P>
<P>
"I am doing everything I can to support my President on this," said Lewis, 
whose 35th District includes part of Palmdale. "This is the first time in the 
more than a decade I've been here that an adjustment downward on the continuing 
growth of entitlements has taken place. I don't want to wait another decade." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said failure to reach an agreement would mean economic and political 
disaster. He suggested this should outweigh the pain that would be inflicted by 
the blueprint to trim the budget by $40 billion this fiscal year and by $500 
billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The package would increase taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcoholic 
beverages; raise Medicare premiums; impose a new tax on expensive cars, boats, 
furs and jewelry, and reduce itemized deductions for taxpayers with incomes 
above $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
It would also require 33 million Medicare recipients to pay more for health 
coverage; impose new Medicare cost-cutting requirements on physicians and 
hospitals; limit farm subsidies and hold spending for non-military programs to 
the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to an agreement was deep automatic spending cuts that would 
have taken effect Monday, the first day of the new fiscal year, under the 
Gramm-Rudman law. This process, known as sequestration, would have led to 
widespread layoffs and sharp cutbacks in services. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), who represents much of the Antelope 
Valley, took the unusual step Monday of publicly inviting his constituents to 
advise him on the proposal while he studies it. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release, Thomas said he "would like to know whether they believe this 
tax-increase plan is superior to sequestration, which would result in 
across-the-board cuts in the federal budget leading to a 41% cut in all 
military programs and a more than one-third reduction in all domestic 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
Even those legislators who expressed reservations about the specifics of the 
11th-hour proposal renewed their general support for cutting the massive 
federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Republicans challenged the excise and sales tax increases and 
defense spending cuts totaling about $180 billion over five years. The 
Democrats, in contrast, said they favor deeper defense cuts and shifting more 
of the tax burden to the wealthy through higher income rates for the top 
bracket. Partisans in both parties expressed concern about the size of the 
proposed Medicare reductions. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement will just allow Congress to keep raising taxes and increasing 
spending," Gallegly said in a news release hours after the details were 
released on Sunday. "That's not what my constituents sent me to Washington to 
vote for." 
</P>
<P>
He expressed skepticism that the non-defense spending cuts would actually occur 
and predicted that the new sales tax on luxury items, once adopted, would 
eventually be broadened. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, a leading advocate of expanded health care as chairman of the House 
subcommittee on health and environment, also expressed immediate opposition to 
the plan. He predicted that the $60 billion in Medicare cuts over five years 
would result in hospital closings and physicians refusing to treat elderly 
patients or cutting corners on care because of the lower reimbursement rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking the elderly to take the brunt of the deficit reductions even 
though they didn't cause the deficit," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
Berman, meanwhile, has voiced reservations but has not made up his mind. "He's 
interested in real deficit reduction, but there are a number of provisions in 
this package about which he has serious concerns," said Administrative 
Assistant Gene Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson, who has long advocated a combination of tax increases and spending 
constraints to eliminate the deficit, called the agreement "a pretty good 
package considering how excruciatingly difficult the politics of putting 
together this kind of agreement are." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his concerns about the Medicare cut, he maintained the plan "is fair. 
It is real. It will help the economy over the long run. And I am still 
convinced we still will do the two things in the next few years that were not 
done: cut defense more and raise the rates on the income tax for very 
high-income people." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the lawmakers said his office had received a small number of telephone 
calls from constituents criticizing the plan. The callers generally expressed 
opposition to the Medicare proposals or to those provisions that would directly 
affect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"One gentleman was outraged, because he doesn't think a $30,000 car is a luxury 
automobile," said one House aide, who requested anonymity.

SUNSHINE CANYON: THE LOW TURNOUT OF TRUCKS ON THE FIRST DAY OF CUTBACKS AT THE 
BRIMMING LANDFILL LEAVES ITS OPERATORS PUZZLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Where has all the garbage gone? 
</P>
<P>
That was the question landfill operators were asking themselves Monday, the 
first day that dumping at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill was scaled back 77% to 
conserve space at the rapidly filling landfill. Despite the cutback, operators 
of other landfills reported no appreciable increases in truck traffic at their 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
And at Sunshine things were so quiet that operators scratched their heads and 
wondered where someone might hide more than 2,000 tons of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Browning-Ferris Industries, which operates the landfill above 
Granada Hills, said they were forced to reduce the daily dumping from about 
3,000 tons to 700 tons, because Los Angeles officials recently killed a company 
proposal to expand the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company is pushing a separate proposal to expand the landfill in 
Los Angeles County territory. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Wise, district manager for Browning-Ferris, had feared last week that 
chaos might erupt Monday morning as haulers competed for the right to deposit 
trash at Sunshine Canyon. Wise envisioned long lines outside the dump on San 
Fernando Road shortly after the gates opened at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work out that way. And Wise was at a loss to explain why. 
</P>
<P>
Before Browning-Ferris announced the cutbacks Sept. 13, the dump typically 
received about 1,000 tons of refuse by 8:30 a.m. each day. But by 9:30 a.m. 
Monday, said a clearly surprised Wise, only 600 tons had been left at the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Warning letters sent to the landfill's regular customers apparently worked. "I 
think we scared everyone off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Truck traffic remained light all day, and Wise closed Sunshine Canyon shortly 
before 2 p.m. after receiving 900 tons of garbage, slightly more than the 700 
tons he had planned. Wise said the tonnage levels may fluctuate until his staff 
adjusts to the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, Sunshine Canyon had remained open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. For 
the first time, following the 2 p.m. closure, work crews posted yellow flags at 
the gate and near freeway off-ramps as a sign to customers, ranging from 
municipalities to private companies, that the dump was closed. BFI is routing 
its own trucks to a landfill in Azusa, but its trucks account for only 8% of 
the total amount of garbage dumped in Sunshine Canyon, Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the three landfills closest to Sunshine Canyon -- Calabasas, 
Chiquita Canyon and Bradley -- said they had expected to see extra trash trucks 
backed up at their facilities. But nothing unusual happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen anything today," said Bob Asgian, site engineer at the 
Calabasas landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is too early to tell," said Paula Becker, spokeswoman for the 
Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley, of the cutbacks' impact. The Bradley Landfill, 
which receives between 2,000 and 3,000 tons a day, had been prepared to accept 
extra trash, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Becker, Asgian and other landfill officials agreed that the cutbacks at 
Sunshine Canyon eventually would start a domino effect that will influence the 
practices and perhaps prices of municipal and private trash haulers searching 
for a place to dump their loads. Already the city of Santa Monica has diverted 
some of its trash trucks from Sunshine Canyon to the other Browning-Ferris dump 
in far-off Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
County sanitation officials and landfill operators said they are cautiously 
watching to see how the scaled down operations at Sunshine Canyon will affect 
the industry. The uneventful turnout Monday may have been an anomaly, said 
Nazareth Chabonian, owner of Blue Barrel Disposal in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
"The trash is going somewhere," he said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHEST PAINS HOSPITALIZE LANCASTER VICE MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster Vice Mayor George Root was reported in stable condition in a hospital 
intensive care unit Monday after being admitted over the weekend suffering from 
chest pains, city and hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Root, 60, who won his office in April, was stricken Sunday just after he and 
his wife had driven back from a conference held in the Orange County community 
of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster spokeswoman Nancy Walker said she did not know the cause of Root's 
chest pains but said he was conscious Monday and talked with fellow council 
member the Rev. Henry Hearns. Root works as facilities manager for the jet 
propulsion laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said she did not know whether Root had prior health problems. Officials 
at Lancaster Community Hospital, where Root was admitted, confirmed that he was 
in stable condition but released no other details.

A 72-year-old Sylmar man was killed by a hit-and-run driver as he crossed a 
street in San Fernando early Monday morning, San Fernando police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd W. Hurlimann was crossing Hubbard Street near 2nd Street when he was hit 
by a red pickup truck traveling south, Sgt. Michael Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck fled but Javier Ochoa, 22, of Sylmar later called 
police to say he had been involved in the accident, Harvey said. Ochoa was

LANCASTER PLANS TO OPPOSE PRISON CONSTRUCTION; 
</P>
<P>
CORRECTIONS: RESIDENTS WANT TO OVERTURN A COURT RULING AND HOPE FOR AN 
IMMEDIATE INJUNCTION TO PREVENT ANY WORK AT THE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encouraged by local residents, the Lancaster City Council decided Monday to 
join the county of Los Angeles in appealing a court ruling last week that 
upheld the state's plans to build a 2,200-bed prison in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
About 85 Lancaster-area residents attended Monday night's council meeting to 
stress their opposition to the planned prison. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the group said they hope the appeal will buy them enough time to 
wage a fight in the Legislature next year to halt the project. 
</P>
<P>
But whether such a strategy would work remains a question, because state prison 
officials are pushing ahead with plans and expect to open bids Thursday for a 
contract to grade the 252-acre prison site at Avenue J and 60th Street West. 
The work could begin later this month or in early November, state officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment they've started with the dirt, it will be much more difficult" to 
stop the project, said Danielle Marvin Lewis, a Lancaster real estate broker 
who is leading the Antelope Valley group that opposes the prison. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that in addition to the appeal, which could take months to resolve, 
she hopes the city or the county will seek an immediate injunction to prevent 
work at the site. 
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear Monday night whether the city or the county might pursue 
that route. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the appeal will be the contention by the city and county that the 
state prepared an inadequate environmental impact report on the project. Last 
Monday, Superior Court Judge Edward M. Ross rejected those arguments, which 
made up the bulk of the legal challenge by the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
The county has already announced plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster prison is half of a 1987 "pain-for-pain" compromise worked out in 
the Legislature that provided for construction of new prisons in both the 
Republican Antelope Valley and heavily Democratic East Los Angeles. The city of 
Los Angeles has a similar lawsuit pending against that project. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Lancaster council had appeared divided on the appeal, with Mayor 
William Pursley and Vice Mayor George Root voicing concerns about the more than 
$80,000 the city has spent so far in legal fees. Root was absent Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Prison foes reacted over the weekend, taking out a half-page ad in an Antelope 
Valley newspaper and passing out flyers urging residents to attend Monday's 
council meeting or call City Hall. City officials said they received 113 calls 
on the prison issue Monday, 103 from residents opposing the current site.

CHARGERS CANCEL CIRCUS REVEIZ; CARNEY HITS TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The circus is over, the zoo ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Fuad Reveiz, cut Monday by the Chargers for missing too many kicks he 
should have made, described his past four weeks as a circus. And with that 
behind him, he plans to take a day or two off and forget about kicking, which 
has been anything but a kick for him lately. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to take my sons to the zoo and just relax and enjoy myself (today) or 
the next day," Reveiz said. "Then I'll wait and see what type of reaction there 
is around the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
The next Charger kicker, John Carney, is scheduled to arrive Wednesday. 
Remember him? He was the guy who was a Charger during exhibition season and 
missed a 27-yarder against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Another 27-yard miss, this time by Reveiz, has put Carney back on the team. 
Reveiz booted his final attempt wide left in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 
17-7 loss to Houston. Monday afternoon, Reveiz left. For good. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now Fuad isn't even close to being hot," Henning said. "He's cold. And 
it's important for our team . . . that we eliminate the cold guy and pick up a 
guy who was excellent in training camp but was cold for a period of time and 
maybe he'll be hot this time." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: The Chargers are taking a chance on a new kicker because he can't 
be any worse than the old kicker. 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz, who made only two of seven field goal attempts in four games, says he 
is a good kicker and, if you don't believe him, you can ask Henning or Larry 
Pasquale, the Charger special teams coach. They believe it. They're as puzzled 
as everyone else why he keeps missing. His motion is fluid, his leg strong. But 
the ball never seems to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Said Henning: "There's been no problem with him other than the fact that he's 
missed five." 
</P>
<P>
That's like saying there's no problem with the lifeguard other than the fact 
that he can't swim. Anyway, Reveiz plans to continue to work out in hopes that 
another NFL team might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
He was prepared for this. Along about the time the 27-yarder curved left on 
Sunday, it entered his mind that he might not be wearing a Charger uniform 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure did," he said. "You just can't miss a 27-yarder no matter what. You just 
can't do that. I don't care what the circumstances are, you're just not 
supposed to do that in this league." 
</P>
<P>
If it had anything to do with popularity, Reveiz would still be around, and he 
might even have a raise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough on everybody, everybody develops a little bond with him," Pasquale 
said. "You don't like to do things like this. I think Fuad understands it's 
nothing personal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard: "He's a nice guy. It's easy to let 
a guy go if he's a jerk. Fuad's not that way." 
</P>
<P>
To say Fuad Reveiz is a scapegoat would be inaccurate, though certainly the 
Chargers might have had more patience if their record was better than 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
"When the team is 1-3 you've got to do something to provide a spark for the 
club," Reveiz said. "And, obviously, if I was six out of six, they wouldn't 
have to do that spark there." 
</P>
<P>
But Beathard said this might have happened anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Had his record been what it is, it would have been tough to stick with him," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz plans to move on and tryout with any team that contacts him. He isn't 
ready to put his football career in dumpster quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of believing in yourself and not quitting," he said. 
"That's something I'm not about to do."

SOCKERS' TOP PICK ARRIVES -- FOR A VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marcelo Balboa -- the Sockers' first pick in the Major Soccer League draft and 
the player team officials hope will reinforced an undermanned defense -- 
arrived in town Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But only for a stopover. Balboa, a U.S. national team member, leaves on Friday 
for Europe, where the U.S. squad will tour for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa said that while he is in town, he and his agent, father Luis Balboa, 
will talk with the Sockers about a contract. But Balboa made it clear he will 
sign with the Sockers only if the U.S. Soccer Federation does not extend his 
national team contract, which expires Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, everything is up in the air," Balboa said. "It all depends on what 
the national team does -- if they give us contracts, or not. If it folds, I'll 
definitely play indoor." 
</P>
<P>
Balboa said USSF officials told players they would be notified of the team's 
future while in Europe, but Eric Wynalda, who, like Balboa, played collegiately 
at San Diego State, said that the USSF plans to continue the national team. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda was drafted by the Dallas Sidekicks. He said he received a message from 
the team last week, but did not return the call because he plans on staying 
with the national team. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part," Wynalda said, "it has been indicated to us that the 
program will go on and that will probably be confirmed on the trip." 
</P>
<P>
Balboa said he has not heard that. 
</P>
<P>
"But maybe Eric has heard something I haven't," Balboa said. "There's been so 
many rumors flying around. I hope he's right." 
</P>
<P>
A sign that Wynalda may be right came Monday when USSF President Alan 
Rothenberg announced that embattled Coach Bob Gansler will be given a contract 
for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. team does continue and a contract is extended to Balboa, the 
Sockers would be in dire need of a solid defender. During the summer they lost 
All-Star George Fernandez and steady Ralph Black through free agency. Two other 
defensive cogs from last year, Cacho and Arturo Velazco, also are gone. Cacho 
has not been offered a contract, though he has been invited to training camp, 
and Velazco plans to play elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Marcelo Balboa is a quality player," said Brian Quinn, a Socker 
player/coach. "And I think he would have adapted quickly. (If he doesn't show) 
it obviously leaves a big void to be filled by us. We were counting on him." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers may have one patch already in place. Quinn said the team will 
likely sign Alex Golovnia, a Soviet player who played outdoor with Socker 
forward Rod Castro during the summer for the Orlando Lions of the American 
Soccer League. Golovnia has not played indoor for any length of time, yet Quinn 
said he has looked promising in training. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we still need another good defender," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the USSF decides not to extend Balboa's contract and he eventually 
makes his way to the Sockers, he will miss all of training camp -- crucial for 
a player who has never played indoor -- and at least the season's first two 
games, Oct. 19 and 20.

ATTITUDE HELPS SWEETWATER STAGE BIG TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PALMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Sweetwater girls' volleyball team can attest, attitude and chemistry can 
make or break a season. 
</P>
<P>
After a 2-12 season and a second-division finish in the Metro League, 
Sweetwater has regrouped. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater (10-3 overall, 6-0 in league) has basically the same personnel as 
last season. But during spring practices, the players weren't just working on 
their skills as athletes, they had to refine their skills as friends. 
</P>
<P>
"The players did not get along last year," Coach Rick Kessler said. "The 
chemistry wasn't good. They'll be the first to admit it. They didn't play as a 
team, and that's why we struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't going to coach this year if they didn't get their act 
together." 
</P>
<P>
But during spring practice Kessler said the girls decided they better change 
their attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"During spring practice they got along great on and off the court," Kessler 
said. "They had always been friends. I just don't know what happened last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Four players, who are the "heart" of the team Kessler said and who have been on 
varsity either two or three years, are captain Patty Gonzalez, April Juric, 
Celia Fausto and Mary Ann Machicote. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater is currently in first place in league, with Castle Park (5-1) 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Since Grossmont junior tailback Jason Eskridge was brought up to varsity at 
mid-season last year, he has gained at least 100 yards in every game he has 
started. 
</P>
<P>
In Grossmont's 27-7 victory over Monte Vista Friday, Eskridge not only gained 
148 yards in 14 carries and scored two touchdowns, but bettered a 10-year 
school record as well. 
</P>
<P>
To start the game, Eskridge returned the kickoff for 95 yards and a touchdown 
to surpass the record of 90 yards set in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
One of the oldest rivalries in San Diego will be renewed Friday at Grossmont 
when the Foothillers play host to Helix. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 40th consecutive year the two schools will play for possession of 
the Musket, the victor's prize. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bigger deal for the school than for the football team," Grossmont Coach 
Judd Hulbert. "The football team looks at them as another team. It would be a 
bigger deal if they were in our league." 
</P>
<P>
Helix leads the series 20-17-2 and hasn't been beaten by Grossmont since 1978. 
The teams tied last year, 21-21. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be a close game," Hulbert said. "Helix is a very good football team. 
It will take a tall order for our football team to beat them. We are 
rebuilding. They're rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 football games La Jolla Country Day played last year, seven of them 
were stopped before the clock ran out. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the Torres racked up a large enough margin against opponents 
that the game was called because of the 45-point rule in eight-man football. 
</P>
<P>
And if their first league victory Saturday is any indication of the rest of the 
season, the Torres could again be unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
The game was stopped at halftime because LJCD (4-0) led Midway Baptist, 63-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Torres, which played their non-league games against 11-man teams, had just 
Friday night to practice before the game because students had their Outdoor 
Education Week and didn't return to San Diego until Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But there wasn't too much concern about the team being able to adjust not only 
to a week without practice but to playing their first eight-man game of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"They were excited to get back and play football," Coach Rick Woods said. "We 
were able to keep everything simple. There were a lot of comments that it 
didn't seem like there were enough guys in the huddle.' 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 13 probably won't come soon enough for City Harbor League football teams. 
That's the day the newly formed Harbor League begins league play and the day 
participating schools can start playing teams their size. 
</P>
<P>
Four games into the season, Harbor schools have been outscored, 457-199. That 
means each week the five schools are giving up an average of 114.25 points 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
The City Harbor League schools are: Christian (2-2), Marian (2-2), Coronado 
(2-2), St. Augustine (2-2) and Clairemont (0-4). 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual High center Eric Meek, a two-time Times All-County selection, has 
narrowed his choice of colleges to Duke, Vanderbilt, Stanford, Washington and 
Kansas. The coaches from the five schools have visited with Meek at his home. 
Next week, Meek will begin visiting each campus. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual basketball coach Tom Buck said Meek had briefly considered 
attending UCLA and Arizona State. Although Meek, who averaged 28.5 points a 
game last year, has played the post position in high school, Buck said every 
school but Stanford is recruiting him as a power forward. 
</P>
<P>
Buck also announced that San Pasqual will be traveling to two holiday 
tournaments during the Christmas vacation. On Dec. 21-22, it will play in a 
tournament at University of Arizona's McHale Center with Artesia High, 
Washington D.C.'s DeMatha High and a Tucson school. On Dec. 27-29, it will play 
in the Raleigh (N.C.) Times Invitational with teams from Pittsburgh, Macon, 
Ga., Mississippi, Tennessee and North Carolina. The Grossmont tournament, held 
in the first week of December, will be San Pasqual's only local tournament.

DUPREE GETS A TRYOUT

Running back Marcus Dupree showed up at Rams Park Monday, five years since he 
last played football. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be like 'The Natural,' wouldn't it?" Coach John Robinson said of the 
improbable comeback attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Dupree, who sustained what everybody agreed at the time was a career-ending 
knee injury while playing for the United States Football League's Portland 
Breakers in 1985, still has a lot to prove, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dupree apparently passed a physical exam Sunday. The Rams worked him out Monday 
and were giving his reconstructed knee a more complex exam later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been five years since I stepped on a football field," Dupree, 26, said.

SDG&amp;E'S WINTER OIL RESERVES ADEQUATE, UTILITY OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing concern over a war in the Middle East has pushed oil prices close to 
record levels and ignited fears of a possible oil shortage during the coming 
winter in colder climates, but San Diego Gas &amp; Electric believes that it 
has a sufficient supply of the now-costly fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always watching the (spot) markets, but we're comfortable . . . we have 
sufficient supplies," said Jim Nugent, manager of SDG&amp;E's fuel department. 
"All of our oil is in the tanks now and we have no plans to make any purchases 
before next spring." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E, which has stockpiled 1.6 million barrels of oil, expects to burn 
about 1 million barrels of low-sulfur oil at its local electric generating 
plants during the coming winter. "That leaves us with about 600,000 barrels for 
an emergency . . . should something happen to the gas pipeline system, or one 
of the nuclear plants (stop generating)," Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E's optimism stems from the fact that the utility committed in June to 
purchasing 285,000 barrels of oil at a cost of $14.30 each, including shipping 
charges. Late last week, Singapore spot crude was offered at about $31 per 
barrel, which, along with transportation expenses, would boost SDG&amp;E's 
costs to about $37 per barrel, Nugent said, if the utility were in the market. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, when SDG&amp;E was burning only oil in its plants, the threat of 
war in the Middle East and the resultant increase in oil prices "would have 
been disastrous," Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
But SDG&amp;E has cut its dependence upon oil through increased use of natural 
gas, a partial ownership stake in the San Onofre nuclear plants and 
construction of the Southwest Powerlink, a transmission line that connects 
power-hungry SDG&amp;E with utilities in the Southwest that have excess power 
to sell. Consequently, even if SDG&amp;E were forced to enter the bidding war 
for spot oil, SDG&amp;E would spend relatively little money to buy oil, Nugent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E prefers to generate electricity by burning relatively clean -- and, 
generally, less expensive -- natural gas in its power plants. But natural gas 
shortages during recent winters have forced SDG&amp;E to burn oil. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not extremely cold there's excess capacity for Southern California Gas 
(which operates gas pipelines in Southern California), but when it's very cold, 
or too cold for a long period of time, you exhaust that (excess) capacity and 
you do have to go to curtailments," Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas' pipeline is capable of delivering 450 million cubic 
feet of gas to SDG&amp;E on a single day. While that supply is sufficient to 
meet the normal demand, on a very cold day, customer demand for natural gas in 
San Diego and southern Orange County could hit 450 million cubic feet, Nugent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E also has taken steps to improve the reliability of its natural gas 
system. It now has about 13 billion cubic feet of natural gas in underground 
storage in the Los Angeles area. SDG&amp;E's natural gas is stored in 
underground fields operated by Southern California Gas, which now has about 100 
billion cubic feet of gas in storage for the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to buying natural gas from Southern California Gas, SDG&amp;E now 
buys some of its natural gas directly from suppliers in Oklahoma, New Mexico 
and Texas. SDG&amp;E ships its gas purchases to the Los Angeles storage area 
through different interstate pipelines, Nugent said.

ANTI-ASIAN BIAS FOUND IN UCLA PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
DISCRIMINATION: UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR SAYS U.S. DEPT. OF EDUCATION'S CLAIMS ARE 
THE RESULT OF FAULTY REASONING AND POLITICAL PRESSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's graduate department of mathematics discriminated against Asian 
applicants in 1987 and 1988 in violation of federal civil rights law, the U.S. 
Department of Education announced Monday after a 30-month investigation. The 
government said 75 other UCLA graduate departments showed no anti-Asian bias in 
admissions and that an additional eight programs kept inconclusive records. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young denounced the conclusions about the 
mathematics department, saying they were the result of faulty reasoning and 
political pressure. The university plans to appeal the findings within the 
Department of Education and, if need be, take the matter to court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The government is asking that UCLA change its admissions policies in graduate 
mathematics programs and offer admission to five Asian-American applicants 
allegedly denied entrance because of bias. The government could deny UCLA all 
federal grants, not just in mathematics studies, if the matter is not settled 
to Washington's liking. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos said in a prepared statement that 
he was encouraged by much of what the probe by his department's Office of Civil 
Rights had found at UCLA. He added, "Although only one program was found to 
discriminate, that is one program too many." 
</P>
<P>
The study determined that there was a disparity between the rates at which 
Anglos, particularly Anglo women, and at least equally qualified Asian-American 
applicants were admitted to the graduate mathematics department and concluded 
that the disparity "appeared to be race related." About a third of the 150 
mathematics graduate students at UCLA are Asian, either American citizens or 
foreigners, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The five rejected applicants allegedly discriminated against do not know that 
they are the object of such controversy and have not been contacted by federal 
authorities, said Michael Williams, assistant secretary for civil rights in the 
Department of Education. He said he did not know the identities of the five and 
would not name them if he did. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of alleged entrance bias against Asians in the UC system has prompted 
several inconclusive state investigations over the past five years. The 
controversy had begun to die down because of significant increases in the ranks 
of Asian-American students at prestigious campuses such as UCLA and UC Berkeley 
this year and last. Asian students now comprise 36% of UCLA's freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
Asian-American activists said Monday's announcement is expected to renew 
suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
A similar federal investigation into undergraduate admissions at UCLA could be 
concluded later this year, Williams said. The results of a probe of Harvard 
University's undergraduate entrance policies may be announced later this week, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on campus Monday, Chancellor Young contended that federal 
investigators relied too heavily on numerical measures, such as grades and test 
scores, and did not take into account how much UCLA considers the reputation of 
applicants' undergraduate schools and the strength of personal recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Some Asians who are U.S. residents but not citizens were denied admission 
because certain government-funded fellowships require the recipients to be 
citizens, Young said. He added that federal officials did not properly consider 
that different disciplines within mathematics, such as statistics and applied 
mathematics, make separate judgments on applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Young alleged that investigators were under pressure from U.S. Department of 
Education officials to announce the results by Monday and to make sure UCLA 
received some criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the study and the results are in error. We believe there is no 
basis for the findings they have reached," he stated. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a response to Young's charge about political pressure, Williams said, 
"I take a great deal of, I have to admit, offense at that. It challenges my own 
integrity." Williams said he had placed an Oct. 1 deadline for the study's 
release because the matter had dragged on for so long. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's insistence that it will appeal disappointed some Asian-American 
activists, who said energies might be better spent on a campus study of the 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that UCLA will conduct a more in-depth review to come up with 
more systematic admissions guidelines," said Stewart Kwoh, executive director 
of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center in Los Angeles and president of the 
Asian alumni group at UCLA.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-PHILIPPINE JUSTICE, SON SENTENCED IN 
SMUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retired Philippine Supreme Court justice and his son were sentenced Monday in 
Los Angeles to a year in prison for trying to smuggle hundreds of guns into 
their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Paredes, 65, of Long Beach, and Quintin Paredes III, 42, of the 
Philippines, also were fined $6,000 each by U.S. District Judge A. Wallace 
Tashima. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Paredes is the former vice governor of Abra province. His son wa a 
lawyer in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
The men pleaded guilty in August to exporting guns without permits. 
</P>
<P>
They were charged in an attempt to smuggle 371 pistols and 500,000 rounds of 
ammunition into the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam said authorities were investigating 
allegations that the guns were intended for opponents of Philippine President 
Corazon Aquino. Defense attorney Ronald Litt dismissed the allegations and said 
the motive was profit.

<TEXT>
<P>
No sooner did we bemoan the lack of a local version of Spy Magazine's "100 Most 
Annoying, Alarming and Appalling People, Places and Things" than the L.A. 
Reader published its "Guide to L.A.: The Good, the Bad and the Utterly 
Repugnant." 
</P>
<P>
Are you stumped when an outsider asks why you live in L.A.? The newspaper's 
staff and readers offered several reasons, including "the feeling it's the 
cutting edge of the planet," its "proximity to the Sierra," and, of course, the 
presence of "the wackos." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the latter, Venice Beach was deemed L.A.'s "best value," followed 
by such runners-up as "the free samples at Price Club." 
</P>
<P>
Most honest politician? The No. 1 response, overwhelmingly, was: "You must be 
kidding." 
</P>
<P>
The "bad and utterly repugnant" list, aside from smog and the other obvious 
villains, was interesting for revealing the things that get on our nerves, such 
as: 
</P>
<P>
* "People who spend all their time thinking about, going to, and talking about 
gyms." 
</P>
<P>
* "People whose names are 'Mike' but spell it 'Myq.' " 
</P>
<P>
* "The bum who stands in front" of a Beverly Hills bank "who the bank manager 
claims is a wealthy bank customer." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like just another wealthy wacko. 
</P>
<P>
A vant-garde art works are no stranger to Manhattan Beach. This is the city 
that unveiled "Ddumbbells," the dumbbells sculpture that was later lifted by 
thieves -- the ultimate good or bad review, depending on how you look at it. 
Then there was the city's three-part welcoming sign, depicting a man, a hat and 
the word "tan" (get it?). 
</P>
<P>
Now the most daring: Resident Jay Berman snapped a photo of one of the city's 
beachfront signs, which sport an international symbol that gives dog-owners the 
scoop on their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
City officials failed to return our phone calls so we can't tell you whether 
they went to an outside design firm for the art work. 
</P>
<P>
The name fits: The seventh-ranking college tennis player in the nation is 
UCLA's Jason Netter. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Salter of Beverly Hills says that when Secretary of State March Fong Eu 
handed out bags bearing her likeness at a campaign function, an onlooker was 
overheard saying: 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know she was missing." 
</P>
<P>
You have to admire the persistence of a bank guard who embarks on a chase of 
487 miles. Especially when he isn't even pursuing a robber. Zoltan (Nick) 
Kraynik, a 42-year-old guard at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, made 
the run from the Bay City to L.A. in two weeks. Rather than recovering money, 
he was raising it -- more than $5,000 for charity. 
</P>
<P>
This being Rideshare Week, we pass along an ad from the Auto Club's 1909 Tour 
Book, courtesy of Gene Wilstach of Murrieta Hot Springs. The ad's claims are a 
reminder, tired commuter, that there was a time when the masses weren't 
entirely sold on motorcars. 
</P>
<P>
Many merchants could see the future, though. The handbook lists such items for 
"autoists" as "glass fronts" (windshields), "auto goggles," "auto dusters," 
"auto puttees," and "auto shoes" for those occasions when it's "necessary to 
dismount in dusty and muddy roads." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone realized how tragically destructive the machines could be, though. 
The innocence of the era is reflected in the many alcohol ads that appeared in 
the handbook, including one by a Spring Street emporium that bragged that "no 
automobile trip is complete without a bottle of Bond and Lillard whiskey."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY WORKERS PROTEST NEW PARKING FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County employees staged a protest outside the Hall of 
Administration Monday to protest new parking fees that went into effect this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The fees are intended to encourage employees who work downtown to car-pool and 
use public transit rather than commute alone. The county's biggest labor union, 
Service Employees International Union, Local 660, contends that the charges -- 
which range from $70 to $225 a month -- are designed to open parking lots for 
private development, which will lead to more air pollution and traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the large number of empty spaces in usually jam-packed parking lots, 
the plan appeared to be working, county officials said.

Ventura County population has grown, but the percentage of workers in different 
industries has remained fairly constant, except for service and government 
workers. Financial analyst Steven D. Cummings said the steady decline in the 
percentage of government workers came after the taxpayer revolt, Proposition 
13, which restricted government revenues.

USC RAPES SUSPECT HELD WITHOUT BAIL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: PAROLEE PLEADS NOT GUILTY AFTER BEING FORMALLY CHARGED WITH ASSAULTING 
THREE STUDENTS NEAR THE CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Willie Damone Taylor, a convicted rapist paroled from prison just last month, 
was ordered held without bail Monday after he was formally charged with the 
rapes of three USC students. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 28, entered not-guilty pleas to 21 felony counts stemming from the 
rapes, which triggered a wave of fear on the USC campus. 
</P>
<P>
The three victims -- all 20-year-old juniors -- were attacked by an intruder 
who broke into their apartments near campus and tied them up, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors asked that Taylor be held without bail -- an unusual request in a 
non-capital case -- because he allegedly threatened to kill his victims if they 
reported their attacks to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"He threatened each of the three that if they reported the incident to police, 
he would come back and kill them," Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew J. McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Judith Adams granted the no-bail request. In response to a 
defense plea, however, the judge said bail could be reviewed at Taylor's 
preliminary hearing, which was set for Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen said the case against Taylor was strong because of fingerprints found 
at the scene of one of the assaults and a strong photo-lineup identification of 
the suspect by one of the rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who identified herself as a former girlfriend of Taylor said she did 
not believe he committed the rapes. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he didn't do it," said the woman, who attended the arraignment and did 
not want her name published. "I believe him." 
</P>
<P>
The first rape occurred Sept. 16 when an assailant opened a sliding glass door 
and entered an apartment on Shrine Place. He raped the woman who lived there 
and stole a small amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days later, two roommates were raped by an intruder who broke in as the 
women slept. He tied up one roommate, raped the other, then tied her up and 
raped the first roommate. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they were led to Taylor by fingerprints found at the second 
scene. He was arrested at a relative's home in Pomona on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who police say has an arrest record dating to his teens, was paroled 
from state prison on Sept. 5 after serving 2 1/2 years of a six-year sentence 
for the 1985 rape of a Long Beach woman. 
</P>
<P>
In a 14-page complaint, Taylor was charged Monday with 11 counts of forcible 
rape, three counts of sodomy by use of force, three counts of residential 
burglary, two of residential robbery and one count each of attempted 
residential robbery and penetration by a foreign object. 
</P>
<P>
The charges carry a maximum sentence of 120 years, McMullen said.

ACTIVIST REPLACES AILING CITY AIDS COORDINATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AIDS activist Phill Wilson was appointed Los Angeles' new AIDS coordinator 
Monday, replacing Dave Johnson, who is resigning because of his personal 
struggle with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Like his predecessor, Wilson, 34, is infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus, but apparently he is in better health. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I feel fine," Wilson said during a City Hall press conference. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of his agenda, Wilson said, will be implementing the city's new AIDS 
policy, the first comprehensive plan designed to prevent the spread of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and assist people afflicted with the fatal disease. 
The policy is scheduled to come before the City Council for action in the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he plans to work with community-based organizations and within the 
city bureaucracy "to make sure the people understand what that policy's about." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the city's first AIDS coordinator, was appointed to the position 16 
months ago. Appearing with Wilson at the press conference, Johnson said he will 
continue to work for AIDS education and assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the major thing I want to get involved with -- after a little time off 
-- is the battle to get people to start caring," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, an Illinois native, has worked with AIDS and gay rights organizations 
for the last several years. Most recently, he was national training coordinator 
for the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
He earned undergraduate degrees in Spanish and theater from Illinois Wesleyan 
University before moving to Los Angeles in 1982, where he was founder and 
co-chair of the Black, Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he is black, Wilson said, will help him send a message to black 
men, whom he believes have been largely ignored by AIDS education and treatment 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he brings a special empathy to the job: He nursed his lover of 10 
years, AIDS activist Chris Brownlie, until Brownlie's death last fall. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Wilson and Brownlie operated a small gift-ware company called Black 
Is More Than Beautiful, but the enterprise became a casualty of the AIDS 
epidemic when Brownlie fell ill, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what it means to take care of someone who's dying of AIDS," Wilson 
said. "I think one of the things we have learned in this community is, if we 
are going to survive, we have to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, who appointed both Wilson and Johnson, said he has no 
misgivings about appointing another AIDS coordinator whose health is in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"If Dave served for a year, or 18 months, then had to leave, the legacy of all 
that he did while he was here is so powerful, so important, I wouldn't dare 
question how long," Bradley said. "The same is true and will be true of Phill 
Wilson."

MAN CALLING SELF 'MESSENGER OF LORD' RAPES 3 WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A man identifying himself as "St. Peter, messenger of the Lord," has raped 
three women in Long Beach in the last two weeks after cutting off most of their 
hair and carving upside-down crosses on their backs, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The women, all in their early 20s, accepted rides from the man, said Long Beach 
Police Sgt. C.S. Roberson. After raping them, the man dumped them out of the 
car naked, leaving them in industrial sections of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"(The rapist) says he is there to redeem the women in the face of God," 
Roberson said. "That's why he cuts off their hair, to give them a cleansing 
before they meet the Lord. He says the hair is a token for the devil or for 
Satan." 
</P>
<P>
All of the assaults have occurred between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., Roberson said. All 
of the victims are described as slender women in their early 20s with long 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
The first assault took place Sept. 16, when a woman was picked up near the 
intersection of Long Beach Boulevard and 6th Street, Roberson said. 
</P>
<P>
A second woman was raped on Sept. 21 after being given a ride near the corner 
of Pacific Coast Highway and Linden Avenue. The third woman was raped Friday 
after accepting a ride near the intersection of Ximeno Avenue and Pacific Coast 
Highway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims told police that after being picked up by the man, he began to rant 
about God and religion, while threatening them with an eight-inch knife. They 
were taken to remote sites near the harbor, where they were raped, Roberson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is described by police as a white man with blonde hair, 28 to 35 
years old, and between 5 feet, 9 inches, and 5 feet, 11 inches tall. Police 
said he is driving a beige Volvo with a sunroof and tinted windows. 
</P>
<P>
Police are also attempting to determine if there are any links between the 
rapes and the shooting death of a woman in her early 30s whose nude body was 
found Sunday morning on the Carson Street underpass of the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, not yet identified by police, was apparently shot at another 
location and her body dumped on the freeway, police said. A motorist discovered 
the body at 7 a.m. Sunday and notified police.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS GUY'S RAIDER-BEAR STORY TURNS OUT TO BE A REAL RIOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, dude, like, you got a problem with Steve Schoenfeld? Maybe he did get a 
little fanciful with the lead of his Raider-Chicago Bear game story in Monday's 
Arizona Republic. So what, dude? 
</P>
<P>
Schoenfeld wrote: "A mugging took place before kickoff. The fan was carried 
off. No bother. This is Los Angeles Raider football. It just added to the 
pregame festivities." 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. What mugging before kickoff? 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the pitcher with a losing record who will appear on next 
year's Hall of Fame ballot for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Road kill: The bumper stickers seen while cruising around Mississippi might 
have been more humorous before Alabama defeated Vanderbilt Saturday -- but not 
much more. 
</P>
<P>
The top line reads: "Honk if you've coached football at Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
Below are the names "(Ray) Perkins, (Bill) Curry and (Gene) Stallings" with 
lines drawn through them, followed by "??????" 
</P>
<P>
Sure lock: An employee in the odds-setting department at Caliente race track in 
Tijuana is paying special attention to the American League East race. And if 
the Boston Red Sox win the division title, he'll be a nervous wreck. 
</P>
<P>
During spring training, when the track inaugurated future book wagering on the 
pennant races and the World Series, the unnamed employee mistakenly set the 
computer at 300-1 on the Red Sox to win the American League championship, 
instead of the correct odds, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jorge Hank, Caliente's owner and general manager: "Seven fans immediately 
saw the tremendous overlay and got down for a total of about $1,000 before the 
mistake was caught and corrected." 
</P>
<P>
Add Caliente: Hank said that one player bet $700 on Boston and added that "even 
though we do have a rule that allows us not to honor tickets issued due to 
obvious human or computer error -- just as all the sports books in Nevada have 
the same clause -- we will nevertheless keep faith with our customers and honor 
their tickets, should the Red Sox win the pennant." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Caliente: And if the Red Sox do make the playoffs against Oakland, 
what about the employee who goofed? 
</P>
<P>
Said Hank: "You can trust me when I tell you that (the Athletics') most 
fanatical fan, at least during the championship series, is right here in 
Tijuana." 
</P>
<P>
These two again?: On this day in 1920, the Cincinnati Reds and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates played the 20th Century's only major league tripleheader. The Reds won 
the first two games, and the Pirates won the third, which was called after six 
innings because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
That's better: Robert G. Brown, 49, finished the 10-kilometer Great Race in 
Pittsburgh Sunday in 1 hour 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "I definitely wanted to run this year." 
</P>
<P>
Midway through last year's Great Race, Brown went into cardiac arrest. In 
January, he had quadruple bypass surgery to open clogged arteries. After two 
months of rehabilitation, he resumed running and gradually increased his 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "I wanted to show people with heart trouble you can do all of the 
things you did before." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Rollie Fingers, with a record of 114-118 and a major 
league-record 341 saves.

AL EAST: TORONTO LOSES IN BALTIMORE, 6-3, THEN SEES BOSTON ON TELEVISION NEARLY 
FINISH OFF THE DIVISION RACE.

The deal came down a few minutes before 11 o'clock Monday night in the 
visitors' clubhouse at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. The Toronto Blue Jays 
stood in their cleats and uniforms and watched on a television screen as the 
Boston Red Sox collected one, two, three outs in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays had this moment to themselves, their clubhouse still closed to 
reporters. The big room smelled of sweat and ointments, and it was silent. No 
one threw a chair. No one cursed, at least not above a whisper. The players 
turned from the television and lined up and ate the dinner a caterer provided. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much to say once the reporters were allowed in. What could they 
say that the standings didn't? The Blue Jays lost a game they had to win, the 
Baltimore Orioles skewering their postseason hopes, 6-3. They are two games 
behind the Red Sox with two to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll come back out here tomorrow and see if we can get some help," Manager 
Cito Gaston said. "If Boston loses two and we're lucky enough to win two here, 
who knows, we'll see. But it looks pretty bad right now." 
</P>
<P>
The players milled around, reconciling their plight. They complained that they 
should have scored more runs off the Orioles' starting pitcher, Jose Mesa. 
Kelly Gruber, the Blue Jays' third baseman, sat on a couch afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Mesa was pretty fortunate to get away with what he did," Gruber said. "We hit 
the ball pretty hard off him and had him shaking his head out there. But a lot 
of balls didn't fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the lead for the first six innings and you looked up and we only had 
three hits. We should have had more." 
</P>
<P>
As Mesa warmed up before the top of the sixth, the scoreboard delivered news 
from Boston: The Red Sox's lead over the Chicago White Sox was up to 3-0. The 
Blue Jays understood that their margin of error had been pared from a thread to 
nothing, but they still could take a nervous comfort in their 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They started the game with two runs in the first, making the statement they 
wanted about not letting the Red Sox get away easily and held the lead until 
the sixth. But David Wells, the Blue Jay starter, walked Bill Ripken to begin 
the bottom of the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The next batter, Mike Devereaux, lined a 2-and-1 pitch into the stands behind 
left field. Suddenly, the score was tied. One out later, Randy Milligan bounced 
a single. Jeff McKnight sacrificed him to second. Up came Bob Melvin with a 
chance to break the tie. His sharp single to left gave the Orioles a 4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa (3-2) wound up the winning pitcher after 7 2/3 innings. He gave up three 
runs and four hits for his second victory over the slumping Blue Jays in 19 
days. Toronto has lost five of its last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Hickey got one out and Gregg Olson finished for his 37th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles made it 5-3 in the seventh on Ripken's single, and Sam Horn hit a 
homer in the eighth to make the score 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
With the Blue Jays down to their last batter, Mookie Wilson, the scoreboard 
flashed the latest from Boston: The Red Sox, having blown a 3-0 lead, scored in 
the the eighth. Wilson struck out and it was all but over.

STEWART UNFAZED BY 2-0 SETBACK; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: OAKLAND ACE OUTPITCHED BY GRAHE, BUT HE'S ALREADY THINKING ABOUT THE 
PLAYOFF OPENER. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty minutes after the Angels' 2-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics, Dave 
Stewart erased the game from his mind. 
</P>
<P>
With a quick nod to Angel rookie Joe Grahe, who allowed Oakland only three hits 
over 8 1/3 innings Monday night and "pitched pretty darn good," Stewart 
pronounced himself ready for the A's American League playoff opener Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to pitch in Boston because it's fairer and you know how the ball is 
going to carry, but I'd much rather go to Toronto if the weather is a factor," 
Stewart said. "It really doesn't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
While Stewart and the A's go to the playoffs and perhaps to the World Series, 
Grahe goes into the off-season with an outstanding finish to his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
Grahe (3-4), once a draft choice of the A's, lingered in the Angels' clubhouse 
long after the game, still wearing his cap and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw their best lineup out there and I'm happy they did," said Grahe, 
who was skipped over twice in the rotation and used his time to develop a cut 
fastball that baffled the A's. "It's something I needed. It made me concentrate 
on each hitter." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also shut out Rickey Henderson in his bid to steal the four bases 
that would tie him with Lou Brock for the all-time lead. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's fifth-inning single to right was one of three singles given up by 
Grahe, but catcher Lance Parrish threw out Henderson trying to steal second. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson went one for four to and is batting .326, two points behind AL leader 
George Brett. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has six stolen bases against the Angels this season, but Parrish -- 
who has thrown out 53 of 117 base stealers -- is determined to keep Henderson 
from getting the record against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll never do it against us," Parrish said. "First of all, he's got to get on 
base that many times and he's not going to do it. It won't be an issue in this 
series." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were locked into a fourth-place finish when Seattle lost, but can 
finish at .500 if they win their last two games. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia tripled and Donnie Hill singled to provide the Angels with a run 
in the first. A two-out double by Dick Schofield and a single by Jack Howell 
produced the insurance run off Stewart (22-11) in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel notes 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Monday at 
Centinela Hospital. He will be re-evaluated in a week and could begin a 
rehabilitation program if no complications arise. Kirk McCaskill will undergo 
arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fetters' start in Wednesday's season finale will be his first start since 
May 19 at Toronto.

NO CONSOLATION TITLE FOR CONE

<P>
The New York Mets may be out of contention in the National League East, but 
David Cone made the best of his final start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Cone (14-10) not only pitched a three-hitter and hit two run-scoring singles in 
the Mets' 4-1 victory over the Pirates at Pittsburgh Monday night, but his 12 
strikeouts gave him a season total of 233, the most in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cone said he would have sacrificed his personal statistics if the game 
had meant anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking on the way to the ballpark that this could have been a big 
game, an important game," Cone said. "It was a depressing thought." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were eliminated from the division race Sunday when the Pirates beat 
the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' Ramon Martinez, who led the major leagues in strikeouts for most 
of the season, had three Monday night against the San Diego Padres and finished 
the season with 223. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, first baseman Dave Magadan is trying to top Willie McGee's .335 
average to win the batting title. Magadan went two for five and remained at 
.330. He needs five hits in eight at-bats to overtake McGee. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be done," Magadan said. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 2, New York 0 -- Time is running out on Cecil Fielder in his quest to 
hit 50 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder went hitless in four at-bats against the Yankees at New York. He still 
has 49 home runs, and his three strikeouts increased his major league-leading 
total to 179. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Travis Fryman did homer for Detroit and Frank Tanana (9-8) allowed only 
three hits over 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder has gone 16 at-bats without a home run and has two games left in his 
bid to become the first player to hit 50 since George Foster in 1977, and the 
first American League player to reach the mark since Roger Maris and Mickey 
Mantle in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 15, St. Louis 9 -- Tim Raines' grand slam highlighted a seven-run 
seventh inning as the Expos used two seven-run outbursts to win at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
It was Raines' ninth homer of the season and fifth grand slam of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Raines' blow offset four home runs by the Cardinals, two by Milt Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Burke (3-3), the last of four Montreal pitchers, went 2 2/3 innings and 
gave up one run. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 7, Chicago 6 -- John Kruk tripled, doubled and drove in three runs 
as the Phillies won at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Ryne Sandberg increased his National League-leading home run total to 40 with a 
two-run shot in the third inning. He became the third player in major league 
history to hit 40 home runs and steal 25 bases in a season. The others were 
Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves in 1963 and Jose Canseco of the Oakland 
Athletics in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's Jose DeJesus (7-8) allowed four hits and three runs in the six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 4, Houston 3 -- Ron Oester scored from second on shortstop Rafael 
Ramirez's throwing error in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Reds a 
victory at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The NL West champions ended a three-game losing streak with the unearned run 
off loser Brian Meyer, who walked Oester to start the ninth. Todd Benzinger 
sacrificed and Billy Hatcher hit a grounder to the hole at short. Ramirez 
fielded the ball but threw it past first into the Reds' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Myers, the fifth Cincinnati pitcher, pitched a perfect ninth for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Browning was erratic in his five-inning tune-up for the playoffs. He gave 
up three runs, eight hits and three walks in five innings and failed to hold a 
2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 5, San Francisco 3 -- Francisco Cabrera hit a three-run homer and John 
Smoltz broke a four-game losing streak against the Giants as the Braves won at 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz (14-11), 0-2 in four starts since his last victory on Sept. 5, held the 
Giants to two runs and three hits in seven innings. He entered the game 0-4 
against the Giants this season with an 8.00 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants fell out of a tie for second place in the NL West with the Dodgers, 
who beat San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 4, Milwaukee 2 -- Ruben Sierra's eighth-inning grounder drove in the 
go-ahead run as the Rangers won at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 2-2, Julio Franco walked and Rafael Palmeiro singled him 
to third with one out in the eighth off Ron Robinson (12-5). Sierra hit a hard 
grounder to first baseman Rob Deer, who stepped on the bag but held the ball as 
Franco scored. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 7, Seattle 5 -- Scott Leius had a two-run double in a five-run second 
inning as the Twins won at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Tapani (12-8) won for the first time since July 30 despite giving up four 
runs and 10 hits in six-plus innings.

RICH DON'T WANT ANY MORE TAXES ON THEIR TOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Down along Mariners Mile in Newport Beach, where opulence is as common as 
leather seats in a Mercedes-Benz, the wealthy and those who serve them yelped 
in pain Monday over a proposed luxury tax on yachts, jewels, cars and other 
accoutrements of the good life. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McLaren, owner of Orange Coast Yachts in Newport Beach, was dour. "If the 
government is going to take 10%, there's 10% less to buy boats," he said, 
adding that a worsening economy had already hurt boat sales. 
</P>
<P>
Another manager of a yacht brokerage, who spent the morning trying to sell a 
$13-million, 145-foot yacht, moaned that Congress was penalizing his industry 
"because people perceive it as a rich man's pursuit, which it is not." 
</P>
<P>
The reactions came a day after President Bush and congressional leaders agreed 
on a package of tax increases and spending cuts aimed at reducing the federal 
budget deficit by $40 billion in the fiscal year that began Monday, and by a 
total of $500 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals are a luxury tax of 10% on the portion of the retail price 
in excess of $30,000 for cars, $5,000 for furs and jewelry and $100,000 for 
private airplanes, boats and yachts. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, on a $35,000 automobile, the buyer would be charged an additional 
10% on $5,000, or $500. A $7,500 diamond ring would cost another $250. 
</P>
<P>
Yachtsmen, furriers, jewelers and luxury auto dealers interviewed Monday all 
held out hope that the big-ticket tax, slated to take effect next year, will be 
voted down by the full Congress. 
</P>
<P>
And members of trade associations with Washington lobbyists promised to oppose 
the measure strongly. 
</P>
<P>
John Malley, owner and president of Dana Harbor Yacht Sales in Dana Point, said 
the tax is likely to hit harder at sales of lower-priced boats than at 
million-dollar yachts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are people that may be stretching to get into the $150,000 to 
$200,000 range," Malley said. "They're not wealthy people in the sense of being 
millionaires, but they still want to buy a boat. They may be compromising 
another facet of their life to make that happen. It may make people change 
their minds and not do it." 
</P>
<P>
Malley said that 25% of his company's sales are in the over-$100,000 range. 
"I've been doing this for 14 years and I have clients that graduate every few 
years. Maybe they bought a $30,000 boat and then an $80,000 boat and their next 
step is $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
At Newport Imports Inc., a Coast Highway auto dealership that sells Ferraris, 
Aston Martins and a lovely cherry-colored Jaguar limousine with a compact disk 
player and fax machine in the back -- all included in the $112,000 sticker 
price -- owner Lee West called the proposal from Capitol Hill "an undue tax on 
successful people." 
</P>
<P>
Yet West figured that it might not hurt sales too badly. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want to spend the money to buy a luxury car and they like the 
product that we're selling, they're going to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Mercedes-Benz sales manager at a San Fernando Valley 
auto dealership said several of his customers expressed concern Monday about 
the proposed luxury tax. The sales manager, Richard Spears of Jim Bess 
Calabasas Inc., said one customer agreed to buy a Mercedes only if the car 
comes in and the sale is completed before the luxury tax takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
Spears said a luxury levy, coming on top of the existing gas-guzzler tax on his 
cars, would hurt sales. "It gets to a point where people say enough is enough," 
Spears said. The Newport Beach broker selling the $13-million yacht looked for 
the silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to like boats, it's something in your blood," he said. "You're 
not going to not do it because of a 10% tax." 
</P>
<P>
For a $13-million yacht, the tax would work out to $1.29 million. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the chairman of Jewelers of America Inc., Michael D. Roman, said 
his industry has been suffering for the past 2 1/2 years and that the new tax 
could be the death knell for small stores and some large chain stores alike. 
</P>
<P>
"Our product doesn't create any health hazards, doesn't destroy the 
environment," said Roman, who put the membership of his group at 13,000, 
representing about 20,000 stores nationwide. Jewelry just "makes people happy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roman asked why the tax was limited to jewelry, planes, yachts, cars and furs. 
"What's a luxury? Is an $80,000 painting auctioned at Sotheby's a luxury? A 
cruise? If you're going to talk luxury, make it luxury. But don't discriminate 
against our business."

DOW SOARS 63.36 AS GOOD NEWS TRIGGERS RALLY;

WALL STREET: A DIVE IN OIL PRICES AND A TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO CUT THE FEDERAL

Wall Street kicked off the fourth quarter with a strong stock and bond rally, 
as news of a federal budget pact and a plunge in oil prices helped halt the 
deepening gloom of recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index leaped 63.36 points, or 2.6%, to close at 
2,515.84 in the best gain since Aug. 27. Many buyers were betting that the 
budget pact will clear the way for lower interest rates ahead, thereby lowering 
the likelihood of a severe recession. The chance of a negotiated settlement in 
the Iraq-Kuwait crisis also spurred optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous key stocks jumped more than 5% for the day, as volume on the New York 
Stock Exchange totaled a heavy 202.21 million shares. The rally was helped by 
strong market gains overseas. In Frankfurt, West Germany, the DAX index 
rocketed 85.84 points, or 6.4%, to 1,420.73 as oil prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
The rally continued in Tokyo today. The Nikkei index closed up 2,676.55, or 
13.24%, to 22,898.41, after losing 761 points Monday. It was a record 
single-day surge. 
</P>
<P>
But many experts cautioned against betting that the bear market has suddenly 
ended. They noted that knee-jerk rallies are typical after prolonged periods of 
selling in bear markets, as investors and traders reach for any straw of good 
news. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, a significant portion of Monday's buying appeared to come from 
so-called short sellers, who had bet in recent weeks and months that stocks 
were going lower. Having guessed correctly, the shorts -- who sell borrowed 
stock -- were buying shares on the open market to close out their positions as 
the market turned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the shorts caused more of a (buying) flurry than Wall Street had 
expected," said Dan Leonard, who runs the $20-million Financial Programs 
Technology mutual fund in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Still, analysts were encouraged by the breadth of Monday's rally, after 
Friday's 25-point Dow gain. Winning stocks outpaced losers Monday by 1,192 to 
436 on the New York Stock Exchange, and the rally expanded as the day 
progressed. The Dow was up 17 points at 10 a.m. EDT, 39 points at noon and 56 
at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index jumped 8.89 points, or 2.9%, to 314.94, and 
the NASDAQ over-the-counter composite index rose 10.14 points, or 2.9%, to 
354.65. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were picking at stocks that have been beaten down 
dramatically," said Len Hefter, manager of over-the-counter trading for 
brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co. in Dallas. "There were legitimate institutional 
buy orders coming in." 
</P>
<P>
The burst of optimism was in part a classic Wall Street reaction after months 
of depressing news, traders noted. By last Thursday, the Dow had lost 572 
points, or 19%, from its July peak of 2,999.75. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many buyers badly want to believe that the worst is over and that Monday's 
action shows it is time to look ahead to a recovery. Here's what spurred 
buyers: 
</P>
<P>
* After months of wrangling, congressional and White House negotiators reached 
an agreement to cut $500 billion from the projected federal deficit over five 
years. Though Wall Street is only beginning to sort out what effects the 
spending cuts and tax increases will have on the economy, investors were simply 
relieved to have a pact, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's constructive," said DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer for 
the $56-billion California Public Employees Retirement System. Even so, he 
said, his fund wasn't a buyer of stocks on Monday. The pact "still has to be 
enacted by Congress," he noted, and many questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
* There was widespread agreement Monday that interest rates will come down 
soon. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has hinted that he would 
ease credit if a budget accord was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Market strategist Elaine Garzarelli at Shearson Lehman in New York cited the 
interest rate outlook as a key factor in her decision Monday to turn bullish. 
She sees the Dow rebounding at least 10% to 12% soon, driven by lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
* Iraq's renewed interest in diplomatic negotiations helped send oil prices 
down more than $2 a barrel, and gave stock traders hope. Yet Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein's back-and-forth rhetoric offers little hope of a solution soon, 
most experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
Investors' desire to see an end to the bear market in Monday's events isn't 
unusual, analysts say. But many believe that stocks still have further to fall 
later this year or early next year, after a short-term rally. The bears say the 
No. 1 problem for the market and the economy is the extraordinary debt built up 
by companies, individuals and government in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the end of a three- or four-year business cycle this time," said 
Peter Eliades, at Stockmarket Cycles newsletter in Los Angeles. "The debt has 
to be liquidated," he said, and that will take years and much pain. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Drug and food stocks were among the biggest gainers, showing investors were 
mostly seeking out the safer stocks. Coca-Cola jumped 2 1/8 to 41 5/8, Merck 
gained 4 1/8 to 80 1/4, Philip Morris rose 2 1/2 to 47 3/4 and Conagra added 1 
3/4 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
* Other big winners included many of the consumer stocks hardest hit in recent 
months. Disney rebounded 5 5/8 to 96 1/4, retailer Carter Hawley Hale gained 
1/2 to 3, Time Warner rose 2 1/4 to 72 1/2 and Circus Circus rose 2 1/8 to 45 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Energy stocks were mostly lower with oil prices. Arco dropped 2 3/8 to 132, 
Amoco lost 1 to 55 3/4, Halliburton gave up 1 7/8 to 49 1/2 and Unocal fell 1/2 
to 30 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Some battered technology stocks were snapped up by bargain hunters. Among 
Southland companies, Computer Sciences rose 3 to 41 1/4, AST Research added 1 
to 17 3/4 and Micropolis rose 3/8 to 5 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times-100 index gained 40.6 points to 2,030.80. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Oil, Budget News Ignites Bonds Surge 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond prices surged Monday as the market cheered a sharp drop in oil 
prices and the federal budget accord reached by congressional negotiators and 
President Bush over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The widely watched 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/32 point, or $10.32 for every 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield dropped to 8.84% from 8.94% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, up from 8% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Chance of Interest Rate Cut Saps Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the deficit-reduction package sent the dollar lower against 
major foreign currencies Monday on expectations of lower U.S. interest rates 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In New York trading, the dollar closed at 136.75 Japanese yen, down from 138.50 
late Friday. Against the German mark, the dollar fell to 1.557 from 1.567. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Gold, Grain, Energy Futures Fall Sharply 
</P>
<P>
Gold, grains and energy futures prices declined sharply as conciliatory 
gestures from the United States and Iraq's Saddam Hussein eased war jitters. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures for October tumbled $15.90 to $386.60 an ounce on New York's 
Commodity Exchange. October silver fell 12.1 cents to $4.64. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum settled on the New York Mercantile Exchange $7.30 to $6.30 lower, with 
October at $426.80 an ounce. Silver settled 15.5 to 12.1 cents lower on the 
Commodity Exchange.

DEFENSE INDUSTRY BARELY NICKED BY BUDGET ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense industry faces painful and long-term cutbacks over the next several 
years, but the agreement between the White House and congressional leaders to 
cut the budget deficit does nothing to further darken expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Top industry leaders were still trying to understand all of the ramifications 
of the budget deal, but the overall numbers seemed to underscore one major 
point: that the Persian Gulf crisis has noticeably slowed the movement to cut 
the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We were headed toward significant cuts on the assumption that we had no 
enemies in the world," Prudential Bache aerospace analyst Paul Nisbet said 
Monday. "That utopian view of the world has been dashed to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Congressional authorizations and appropriations will be made later this year, 
determining the fate of such key programs as the Northrop B-2 bomber and the 
McDonnell Douglas C-17 cargo jet, both of which are critical to their companies 
and are major Southern California employers. 
</P>
<P>
Such specific programs were not included in Sunday's budget agreement, which 
still must be approved by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
To the amazement of some analysts, the budget accord will increase Pentagon 
spending by several billion dollars in fiscal 1991, compared to the level that 
Congress was likely to authorize. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, that increase in Pentagon spending does not include the estimated $15 
billion for the Persian Gulf crisis. If that amount were included in the 
Pentagon budget, spending would grow to $303.5 billion, just short of the 
original Bush Administration proposal earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the budget agreement, the Pentagon will separately receive $288.5 billion 
in budget authority during 1991. By comparison, the House had authorized only 
$283 billion and the Senate $289 billion, a difference that was likely to be 
compromised at some midpoint. Thus, the Pentagon is likely to receive several 
billion more under the budget accord than it was under a compromise of the 
earlier House and Senate authorizations. 
</P>
<P>
Nisbet estimates that the eruption of the Persian Gulf crisis has resulted in a 
$20-billion windfall of additional funding for the Pentagon during the fiscal 
year that started Monday. "If the Persian Gulf crisis goes away, and everybody 
forgets this can be a nasty world, then we could go back to cutting the 
budget," he said. "But that is a lot of ifs, and history does not bear out 
those assumptions." 
</P>
<P>
But other analysts continue to expect a protracted downturn in defense 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this budget accord will affect the defense budget any more 
greatly then what I expected before the compromise," said Ron Hertenstein, vice 
president for Forecast Associates, a Newtown, Conn.-based aerospace market 
research firm. "Cutting defense didn't have anything to do with the Persian 
Gulf. It had to do with Europe, and that is proceeding as we expected. The 
forces planned in the budget should be sufficient for Desert Shield-type 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the budget accord provides for a sustained decline in Pentagon 
spending. It would drop by $35.1 billion by 1992, $47.2 billion by 1993, as 
much as $58.6 billion by 1994 and as much as $69.6 billion by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario would depress Pentagon spending by nearly 25% by the mid-1990s, a 
prospect for which the defense industry has been well prepared during much of 
this year and a vastly better outcome than the Draconian 50% cutbacks proposed 
by some reformers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can still have national security (under the long-term cutbacks), as long 
as you don't have a major nuclear threat or a major conventional conflict," 
Hertenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts, however, say the projections beyond 1991 have little credibility 
because the budget accord does not mandate the cutbacks and future Congresses 
may not even remember what was agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
Information about specific programs will not come until the House and Senate 
compromise on their earlier authorization bills.

PLANNED FARM SUBSIDY CUTS DECRIED; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: THE GRAIN BELT WOULD TAKE THE BIGGEST HIT. BUT CALIFORNIA WON'T 
ESCAPE THE TRIMS SOUGHT BY U.S. BUDGET NEGOTIATORS.

American farmers face $13 billion in budget cuts to federal agriculture 
programs, cuts that many farm groups argued Monday could unfairly burden wheat 
and grain growers nationwide and mete out the harshest punishment to the 
Midwestern Grain Belt. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the states where grain and cotton are major commodities will be 
hit," said Robert A. Denman, spokesman for the National Farmers Union. "The 
biggest hit will come out of the wheat producers in the Plains States. Their 
production costs are higher and their options are fewer." 
</P>
<P>
California farmers have traditionally fared best at budget-cutting time because 
the state grows an estimated 250 different crops on a commercial scale and 
hence its farm economy does not rely heavily on federal subsidies. But even 
California won't escape the cuts proposed by budget negotiators on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's popular to say that California farmers aren't impacted by the federal 
farm programs because we have a diverse agriculture here," said George Tibbits, 
director of national affairs for the California Farm Bureau Federation. "I 
always end up refuting that. The farm programs do have a significant impact on 
farmers in California." 
</P>
<P>
Congressional and Administration budget negotiators have not pinpointed the 
agricultural programs that will be cut; the only strict orders were that $13 
billion be trimmed over five years and that $1.3 billion worth of cuts must 
come out of fiscal 1991 subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
But the Office of Management and Budget has made what one House Agriculture 
Committee source on Monday called "suggestions" for Congress to follow as it 
figures out where the $13 billion will come from. 
</P>
<P>
One OMB suggestion was that "target prices" -- the price for which crops should 
ideally sell -- be cut by 2% a year. The target price generally is higher than 
the market price for which a crop actually sells. Since the government pays the 
difference to farmers in the form of subsidies, lower target prices mean lower 
government outlays. 
</P>
<P>
OMB also suggested cutting "base acreage" -- the number of planted acres 
covered by government subsidies -- by 3% per year. The OMB figures that this 
two-part plan could save $500 million in 1991 and $12.4 billion over the life 
of the five-year budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
States such as Kansas, whose farmers grow mostly wheat and are heavily enrolled 
in government subsidy programs, would be hardest hit. With $6.6 billion in farm 
revenue in 1988, the last year for which such statistics are available, Kansas 
was the No. 5 farm state in the nation. But a whopping $848 million -- or 13% 
of its revenue -- came from federal farm subsidies, making it No. 6 in the 
country in handouts. 
</P>
<P>
California, by contrast, is the nation's No. 1 farm state, with $16.6 billion 
in farm receipts in 1988, but it drops all the way to No. 15 when federal 
subsidies are counted. Only about 2% -- or $335 million -- of California's farm 
income came from federal programs, said Frank Limacher, an economist with the 
state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Still, California is the No. 2 cotton state behind Texas, and an estimated 6% 
of the state's irrigated agricultural land is planted in wheat. Both cotton and 
wheat are federally subsidized, and growers here will feel the pain of budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the deficit is being cut on the back of wheat, cotton, feed grain and 
rice programs, and the other elements of the farm program are really not taking 
that much of a hit," said Daniel M. Weldon, executive vice president of the 
California Assn. of Wheat Growers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to what he termed the "unfair" distribution of the cuts, Weldon is 
concerned about the timing of the budget discussions and the uncertainty that 
timing causes. 
</P>
<P>
"Planting of wheat starts in late October and goes through through November," 
Weldon said. "Right now, farmers really don't know what the farm program is. 
Farmers are making plans with bankers, getting loans arranged, making 
projections about what they want to plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The banker looks at farm-program income," he said. "As that is reduced, it's 
going to put lending to farmers in greater jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REVENUES VS. SUBSIDIES 
</P>
<P>
Although California is the nation's No. 1 state in farm revenues, it gets a 
disproportionally small amount of federal farm subsidy payments because of its 
diverse crop production. The following figures are from crop year 1988, the 
most recent year for which statistics were available.

Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $9.2 billion of three-month bills 
at an average discount rate of 7.18%, down from 7.32% last week. 
</P>
<P>
Another $9.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 7.21%, down from 7.33% last week. The rates were the lowest since 
three-month bills sold for 7.17% on Sept. 19, 1988, and six-month bills 
averaged 7.19% on Aug. 6, 1990. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors -- 7.41% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,818.50, and 7.59% for a six-month bill selling for $9,635.50. The 
discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities 
are purchased at less than face value.

AMD Introduces New Chips: A new breed of microprocessors developed by Advanced 
Micro Devices Corp. combines on a single piece of silicon many components 
needed for an IBM-compatible personal computer. The so-called semi-computers 
can match the function of entire circuit boards containing anywhere from a 
handful of chips to 175 separate integrated circuits. The technology is 
expected to spawn a new generation of smaller and less expensive personal 
computers.

AMERICA WEST PLANS TO BUY UP TO 118 AIRBUS AIRCRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
America West Airlines, intent on a major expansion of its routes, said Monday 
it plans to acquire up to 118 European-made Airbus Industrie A320 airliners 
during the next 15 years in a transaction that could ultimately total $5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Conway, the Phoenix-based carrier's president, also said in an 
interview that the airline is still negotiating to buy the Pan American World 
Airways shuttle, which flies between New York, Washington and Boston, and might 
use some of the new planes on those routes. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated deal, 7-year-old America West has committed itself to buy or 
lease 74 aircraft on firm order. The airline said that if all of the additional 
44 options are exercised, it will be the largest commitment by any airline for 
the A320 so far. 
</P>
<P>
The first 16 planes will be leased and put into service next January. They had 
originally been ordered by financially troubled Pan Am, which subsequently sold 
its assembly line positions to Braniff. Then Braniff filed for bankruptcy after 
flying a few of the A320s for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 16 planes are parked at America West's hangars in Phoenix and are 
being painted with new logos and reconfigured to have 148 seats and two classes 
of service. 
</P>
<P>
The other parties to the transaction with America West and Airbus -- which is a 
consortium of government-subsidized companies in Germany, France, Britain and 
Spain -- are Guinness Peat Aviation, an Irish airplane leasing company; 
Kawasaki Enterprises, a Japanese leasing company, and Hartford, Conn.-based 
International Aero Engines, which will provide the V2500 engines for the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The A320 is a two-engine, medium-range airliner that can carry up to 150 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, America West received $220 million in cash advances, 
crew training and spare parts from the engine maker and the leasing companies. 
Conway said it has not been determined how many planes will be leased and how 
many will be purchased, with the decision depending on financial conditions 
when each is delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money, he added might be used for a purchase of the Pan Am Shuttle. 
He said, "Serious negotiations are taking place with Pan Am on an ongoing 
basis, but we have not reached any agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Some observers have speculated that if America West buys the shuttle it might 
shut down the operation, merely wanting to obtain its airport gates in 
Washington, New York and Boston. Gates are rationed in the airports in New York 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
America West's new planes will allow it to benefit from what Conway said is 
"the last shakeout of deregulation." He said a void would be created by cuts at 
other carriers, enabling one with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet to thrive. He 
said America West intends to expand its route structure and add flights to 
successful existing routes.

MANY FIRMS FORGOING DIVIDEND INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The threat of recession is driving corporate managers to sharply restrict their 
dividend generosity with shareholders, in an effort to conserve cash. 
</P>
<P>
Only 56 companies raised their dividends in September, the lowest tally since 
October, 1971, Standard &amp; Poor's reported Monday. S&amp;P tracks dividend 
actions by thousands of companies. The 56 dividend increases in September 
compares to 81 increases in September, 1989, and an average of 113 in the first 
eight months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P now estimates that only 1,300 dividend hikes will be tallied this year, 
down more than 20% from 1989 and the lowest figure since 1971, when President 
Nixon proposed that companies voluntarily restrict dividends in the war on 
inflation.

Unisys Corp. on Monday unveiled a strategy to link its computers with those of 
competitors, saying it would provide a method unmatched by IBM, Digital 
Equipment Corp. and other computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys, the nation's third-largest computer company, said 
its Integrated Information Environment's software masks the differences between 
Unisys machines and those of other companies so they can be joined in a 
network. 
</P>
<P>
Unisys said its new method will adhere to the increasingly popular "open 
systems" strategy, in which computers and software follow sets of industry 
standards so they can be used interchangeably.

GANNETT STOCK OFFER REJECTED BY FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Gannett Foundation said Monday that it had rejected a bid from Gannett Co. 
to buy its 10% share in the company for $540 million and that it was formally 
authorizing its investment bankers to explore other offers. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection is the latest turn in the strange feud between querulous former 
Gannett Chairman Allen H. Neuharth, who controls the foundation, and his old 
company. That dispute became public in April, when the foundation announced 
that it planned to sell its stake in Gannett, contending that the company's 
dividend was not high enough to finance the foundation's activities. Gannett is 
suffering from a recession in the newspaper business. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts viewed the decision to sell the stock in the first place 
as an unusual public statement of disapproval by Neuharth of the way his 
handpicked successors have run Gannett. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's statement, Martin F. Birmingham, chairman of the foundation's 
finance and investment committee, called Gannett's bid to pay the current 
market price of $33.875 a share "unsatisfactory" and said it would be 
"irresponsible" to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
"The current depressed market price of Gannett stock does not represent the 
true value of the company," Birmingham said. He noted that the $540-million 
offer contrasts with a market value for the foundation's stake of $800 million 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been offering the market price since it expressed an interest 
in buying the stake in May, when the stock was trading for more than $42 a 
share, or closer to $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation also said Neuharth had advised earlier that "no substantive 
talks with interested third parties would take place as long as serious 
negotiations were going on with Gannett." But earlier this year the foundation 
publicly acknowledged it had received "numerous expressions of interest" from 
potential buyers and had hired the investment firm Salomon Bros. to handle the 
transaction.

CALMAT SWAPS ITS CEMENT UNIT FOR STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CalMat, one of Los Angeles' oldest and largest companies, Monday swapped its 
California Portland Cement subsidiary for CalMat stock held by the largest 
cement maker in Japan in a deal valued at about $310 million. 
</P>
<P>
Onoda Cement Co. bought the 5.8 million shares and received the option to buy 
California Portland Cement two years ago as part of a deal that thwarted a 
hostile takeover of CalMat by New Zealand corporate raider Ronald A. Brierley. 
Industry officials had expected Onoda to exercise the option, making it the 
state's largest cement producer and further increasing foreign control of the 
U.S. cement industry. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, CalMat will receive $68 million in cash, and Onoda's 
cement subsidiary will assume $18 million in debt. CalMat said it will use the 
cash to reduce debt and might buy back some of its common stock in the future. 
The 5.8 million shares obtained from Onoda will be retired. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will leave CalMat as one of the nation's largest producers of sand and 
gravel -- its core businesses -- and of asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, with 
a total of about 100 plants. The cement subsidiary accounted for about 15% of 
CalMat's $29 million in first-half profit this year but had the company's 
narrowest profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plans are to concentrate on aggregates (rock and sand) and to grow," said 
Ron Hadfield, CalMat's chief financial officer. "We also have 34,000 acres of 
land and we will continue to be in the real estate business in terms of land 
development." 
</P>
<P>
The swap will give Onoda California Portland Cement about 20 plants and 
facilities in California and Arizona to make and distribute ready-mix concrete 
and cement, which is used to make concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald E. Evans, 52, who has headed California Portland Cement as an executive 
vice president under CalMat, will be retained by the new owners as president of 
the Glendora-based company. A company official said no major changes in 
operations or staff are anticipated as a result of the Onoda takeover. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Onoda stepped in as a corporate white knight by buying the 5.8 million 
CalMat shares at $41.75 each from Brierley. 
</P>
<P>
A construction industry slump has hurt the profitability of the U.S. cement 
industry.

TOLD CUTS JOBS AS VACANT OFFICES MAKE NEW KIND OF OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the open spaces that lured Jack Gilbert to Ventura County, where TOLD 
Corp., his Oxnard-based real estate company, started in the early 1970s 
building office parks in bean fields, then often watched other businesses 
stream into the area. 
</P>
<P>
But people who watch the commercial real estate market in Ventura County these 
days have their minds on a different kind of open space: empty offices in the 
region, signaling a slowing demand for the space by area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Office vacancies in Ventura County reached 23% at the middle of this year, 
compared to 15% a year earlier, according to a survey by Grubb &amp; Ellis, a 
real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
That's bad news for TOLD, which grew to become one of the county's biggest 
developers. Since the beginning of the year, the company has laid off more than 
a quarter of its Ventura County work force, reducing its employees from about 
135 to 97. (The company also has employees and operations in Wisconsin, 
Minnesota and Washington state.) 
</P>
<P>
Most of those layoffs were in TOLD's construction division, where work has 
slowed to a trickle. It was only TOLD's second round of layoffs since it was 
founded, but TOLD had many fewer employees in the earlier slowdown in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of hard times, Gilbert said, is that about 45 of the company's 400 
or so tenants are unable to pay their rent, compared to six a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said TOLD won't make a profit in the fiscal year that will end March 31 
unless, as planned, it sells two of the buildings it owns. Revenues of real 
estate companies like TOLD can fluctuate dramatically, because the sale of a 
few buildings can bring in much more money in a day than renting the same 
buildings all year. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said that, if it does sell the buildings, TOLD will probably be 
profitable, with about $65 million in revenues; if it does not, TOLD will 
probably show a loss on about $25 million to $30 million in revenues. Last 
year, TOLD showed a profit on $53 million in revenues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown, Gilbert said, the vacancy rate is actually lower now than 
a year ago -- 18% compared to 30% -- in its 3 million square feet of completed 
industrial and office buildings in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason, he said, is that TOLD began last year to reduce its inventory 
of available industrial and commercial space (including buildings under 
construction) from about 1.2 million square feet 15 months ago to 400,000 
square feet recently, mainly by slowing its rate of office construction and 
renting out what space it had. 
</P>
<P>
TOLD President Pat Hall admitted that "we weren't so bright" as to foresee a 
recession. "We just saw seven years of expansion" and decided to get ready for 
those days to end, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers in the area are also feeling the effects of the downturn. 
Russell Goodman, the Ventura County regional president of the Sammis Co., a 
nationwide commercial developer based in Irvine, said three office buildings it 
opened last November have been filling up slowly. But, Goodman said, "I don't 
see any softening" in Sammis' leasing and sales of industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
Across Ventura County, one problem affecting all the developers was that a 
large amount of office space came on the market in April, May and June, 
according to a survey by Grubb &amp; Ellis. One new building with 111,000 
square feet came on the market when its owner, Chevron Corp., decided not to 
move in. 
</P>
<P>
But the higher vacancy rate wasn't all due to new space becoming available. 
Demand -- as measured by the change in occupied space, or "net absorption" -- 
was also sluggish. From the first to second quarters of this year, net 
absorption in Ventura County fell from 111,059 square feet to 26,665 square 
feet, Grubb &amp; Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Some aren't so worried about the statistics. "I think it's a blip in the 
market," said Thad Seligman, a vice president and district manager for Grubb 
&amp; Ellis in the county. Sammis' Goodman agrees. 
</P>
<P>
But Gilbert said that, for now, TOLD is a bit more pessimistic about the 
Ventura County commercial real estate market. "We believe we're three to four 
months into a downturn that has five to six months to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, looking for other real estate markets to invest in while Ventura 
County slows down, TOLD recently bought two buildings in Dallas -- where the 
real estate market has suffered through a recession for most of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
TOLD's Craig L. Miller said the company paid less than half of what it would 
cost now to construct the two buildings -- with a total of 287,000 square feet 
of office and industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said that, if real estate values in Texas climb and TOLD's gamble pays 
off, the company won't be able to make similar deals endlessly. "This can't go 
on forever," Gilbert said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SYSTEMS LEASE TO OFFER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Systems Lease Fund Ltd., a start-up partnership in Woodland Hills that plans to 
acquire and lease telecommunications systems, hopes to raise up to $12 million 
with an initial public offering of 1,920 limited partnership units. 
</P>
<P>
In registering the securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Systems Lease said the units would be priced at $6,250 each and offered through 
Brokers Investment Corp., a securities firm that is an affiliate of Systems 
Lease. 
</P>
<P>
The offering requires investors to buy at least two units. The company does not 
expect a public market to develop for trading its units, the filing added. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the proceeds would be used to buy equipment that would then be 
leased to a company called Telequip Financial Services Ltd., a Nevada limited 
partnership, the filing said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: STORAGE PROPERTIES RAISES $32 MILLION IN STOCK SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Storage Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust in Glendale, completed 
an initial public offering of common stock in which it raised about $32 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Storage Properties is an affiliate of Public Storage Inc., a Glendale-based 
operator of self-storage warehouses, and Storage Properties mainly invests in 
those structures. 
</P>
<P>
Storage Properties began its offering 18 months ago on a "best-effort" basis, 
in which securities firms agree to do their best to sell the stock to the 
public, as opposed to a "firm-underwriting" deal in which the firms buy stock 
outright from the issuer, then sell it to the public. The latter transactions 
usually are completed more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock was offered at $10 a share, and most of the shares were 
sold last year, said Storage Properties President Harvey Lenkin. The offering 
ended Sept. 17, and the stock began trading Monday on the American Stock 
Exchange, where it closed at $7.625 a share.

WHAT PRICE FOR THAT BIG DAY?;

<P>
CULTURE: THE "THEME" BAR AND BAT MITZVAHS OF THE '90S ARE PRODUCTIONS, WITH 
ENTERTAINERS, LAVISH SETTINGS AND BUDGETS TO MAKE PARENTS SWOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The bat mitzvah girl was not alone. There were nine of her, dancing like a bat 
mitzvah-girl chorus line across nine -- count 'em, nine -- television sets. 
</P>
<P>
"This is broadcasting television technology that we're making available to the 
bar mitzvah market," said Vince Doyle, a bar mitzvah professional, as he 
hovered before his flashing "video wall" at Los Angeles' first bar mitzvah 
planning show Sunday. "You can turn it into the 'Arsenio Hall Show.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Oy. So you want to do a bar mitzvah? How about hiring a man with a giant Elvis 
head? Why not do it at the Hollywood Bowl? Have you considered a giant cake 
shaped like a Torah or a Hollywood-theme reception, with the bar mitzvah boy's 
name on a marquee? Or elephants or Laker girls or chocolates shaped like 
baseball bats? 
</P>
<P>
"I want M. C. Hammer at my bar mitzvah," Eric Grossman, 9, said of one of 
America's most exuberant rap stars. 
</P>
<P>
Can't touch that, kid. Your dad says he has limits. But even a man with limits 
is looking at an ever-expanding tab of a good 15 grand or so these days. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's spending their life savings for a bar mitzvah," said Eric's dad, 
Marvin, 44. "Everybody tries to keep up with everybody else. It's a real 
rip-off." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the bar mitzvah of the '90s, everyone's keeping up with the 
Schwartzes. Or so said some of the startled buyers and sellers at the bar 
mitzvah show at the Warner Center Marriott Hotel in Woodland Hills, which drew 
about 2,000 parents and children, along with 65 caterers, photographers, 
florists and other party people. 
</P>
<P>
Bar mitzvahs "have gotten outrageous," said Jill Herzig, a show organizer and 
proprietor of Lip Sync Inc., which videotapes small bar mitzvah guests lip- 
syncing, with sponge guitars, to "The Beverly Hillbillies" theme, "La Bamba" 
and other memorable tunes. 
</P>
<P>
"People spend incredible amounts of money," Herzig said. "That's why party 
planners and caterers and photographers are so happy to be here. We've done bar 
mitzvahs where they spend $150,000. You get rented palm trees. You get the 
child delivered for a grand entrance on top of a Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
Or as one dismayed parent, Shelly Sherwin, put it: "When you live in Southern 
California, the sky isn't even the limit." 
</P>
<P>
A bar mitzvah isn't just fun and games anymore. It's serious business. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy said he wanted a clown parachuting into the party, and he said he 
wanted a flight pattern onto the beach," said Kristy Patterson, whose company, 
Hollywood Bowl Catering, happily happens to do bar mitzvahs both at the Bowl 
and the beach. She wasn't up on the flight pattern situation, however. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, you did just read the words Hollywood Bowl. But don't get too excited. 
That's really the Hollywood Bowl restaurant, although it should come as no 
surprise that Patterson did get a number of inquiries about renting the very 
expensive stage. "A lot of kids have an orchestra theme and they want to be a 
conductor of the Philharmonic." 
</P>
<P>
The operative word here is "theme." Bar and bat mitzvahs, for boys and girls 
respectively, are no longer mere receptions capping a child's virtuoso display 
of Torah reading and celebrating their step up to adulthood. They are theme 
events, much like the proms of their parents' youth. The difference is, picking 
up the tab for a tux and an orchid is, in comparison, getting off cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Take the bar mitzvah with a broadcast sports theme that Teri Smolar of Reigning 
Parties is putting together. Each table will have a centerpiece with 
fluorescent tubing spinning up to a blurb that says something like "You're 
out!" "We're doing stadium seats, binoculars for place cards." No Laker girls 
for this one, but that's only because no one asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they will script cheers" for the bar mitzvah boy, said Smolar, 37. 
"You can be as elaborate as you want. There's the peanut man who throws out 
peanuts, but that's already overdone. Five-and-a-half-foot trophies, 
marble-ized. We work very high. We work very aerial." 
</P>
<P>
Don't think parents are so busy kvelling over their kids that they haven't 
noticed what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets expensive, but everyone does it, so if you don't do it, you feel like 
you're cheating your kid. I'm forced into it," said Rosalie Hiller, an Encino 
mom who recently forked over $20,000 for a relatively modest bat mitzvah with a 
piano theme and is looking at a second one. 
</P>
<P>
That makes Hiller worry about the message she is sending her children about 
money. And she worries because family members are at each other's throats 
during the last weeks leading up to the event. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, Sweet Sixteens are falling by the wayside and bat mitzvahs are 
picking up the slack. And Hiller, with two girls, is ready to do it all over 
again: "When you're 13, you do it big. It was her party. It was her coming out. 
On balance, when you close your eyes and don't think about the money, it's 
something very special." 
</P>
<P>
Special? How about special effects -- with theatrical lighting and smoke and 
people in giant Barbara and George Bush heads and the bar mitzvah boy arriving 
in a silver spaceship? How's that for special? 
</P>
<P>
"This is weird," said an unimpressed Michael Bernstone, 12. "It's all adults 
with adults. A bar mitzvah is nice, formal. You dance. You eat. You say, 
'Goodby.' That's it." 
</P>

Foreign ministers of the 12-member European Community will tackle two tough 
questions -- the Persian Gulf crisis and the political union of the Continent 
-- at a special three-day meeting in the northern Italian town of Asolo 
beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a follow-up to the last EC summit meeting in Dublin, the foreign ministers 
are expected to explore various plans for establishing a closer political 
grouping among the nations of Western Europe -- a move resisted by Britain, and 
more recently, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
That topic, however, will be overshadowed by discussions of the amount of 
assistance the European nations should provide in the gulf crisis, and the 
damage that a full-scale war could to do Western European economies.

Austria holds parliamentary elections Sunday against a backdrop of heavy 
anti-foreigner sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
The two mainstream parties that have ruled Austria since 1955 -- the Socialists 
and the Christian Democratic Austrian People's Party -- have been put on the 
defensive by the small Freedom Party, which has made gains with its anti-crime, 
anti-immigrant platform. Targets are the 150,000 Poles, Romanians and 
Czechoslovaks who poured into Austria legally and illegally after the opening 
of Eastern Europe's borders during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Socialists fear a potential coalition between the People's and 
Freedom parties, which would mark a sharp turn to the right for Austria.

<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cartoon in the Mexico City daily newspaper Excelsior depicts a barefoot 
peasant jumping for joy: "Oil prices are up!" he cheers. "We're not going to be 
poor anymore!" 
</P>
<P>
But in the next frame the bedraggled soul falls to the ground: "Oh, my memory 
is failing me," he says, scratching his head. "Well, they won't fool me again." 
</P>
<P>
As the Persian Gulf crisis continues to drive up world petroleum prices, 
delivering a $500-million-a-month windfall to oil-rich Mexico, many Mexicans 
are suddenly reminded of the last oil boom that promised them riches but 
somehow resulted in economic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
They are wondering if history will repeat itself or if this government will 
know how to manage its good fortune better than previous administrations. In 
short, will the added oil income substantially benefit Mexico in months to 
come? 
</P>
<P>
Most officials and business analysts say yes, that President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari has a first-class economic cabinet that has learned from past mistakes. 
The government will continue to reform the economy and to manage it smartly, 
they argue, and will not be beguiled by the sudden cash. 
</P>
<P>
There are cautionary voices, however. The Mexican government will face pressure 
to increase spending, pressure especially from the poor and working classes, 
who have paid a heavy price during eight years of economic austerity brought on 
largely by the government's failure to manage its previous boom. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) faces competitive 
congressional elections next year and may be tempted to beef up public works 
projects before the vote or to postpone difficult economic decisions until 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mexico's sustained economic recovery depends greatly on the United 
States. A U.S. recession brought on by the high oil prices could limit badly 
needed foreign investment in Mexico and make it more difficult for Mexico to 
negotiate a favorable free-trade agreement. Mexico needs access to U.S. markets 
for its goods, but a serious recession probably would raise protectionist 
sentiment in the United States. A bill passed by the House this month that 
would limit textile and shoe imports is a good indicator. 
</P>
<P>
With the new oil money, Mexico's imports most likely will rise, and so will its 
trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"High oil prices produce money now, but it is like a drug," said Heberto 
Castillo, an engineer and leader of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
"At first you feel the euphoria, and you think you have a greater capacity to 
work. But you have to remember what it's like to wake up the next day. The 
government should not increase borrowing or production and export of oil." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo was one of the few voices warning against the "petrolization" of the 
Mexican economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico discovered its vast oil reserves in 1976 and 1977, and for an 
underdeveloped country, it was like a dream come true. The government began 
pumping as fast as it could, and before long the Mexicans were being called the 
Arabs of Latin America. Oil prices climbed from $13.31 a barrel in 1978 to 
$33.19 in 1981. During those years, Mexico earned $50 billion in oil revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. and European banks, filled with petrodollars from the Middle 
East, came knocking at Mexico's door, offering to lend against future oil 
income. The foreign debt grew from $49 billion in 1980 to $86.7 billion in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the money went back into Petroleos Mexicanos -- the giant state-owned 
oil monopoly, known as Pemex -- for exploration, drilling and the construction 
of petrochemical plants. Pursuing accelerated growth, the government of 
President Jose Lopez Portillo initiated expensive and large-scale public works 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Lopez Portillo believed it was preferable to grow with inflation than not to 
grow with low inflation," said Carlos Ramirez, an editor and columnist for El 
Financiero newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Growth reached 8% a year, but annual inflation rose from 16% in 1978 to 29% in 
1981 to 98% in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thought oil prices would keep going up," said Jonathan Heath, chief 
economist at the Macro Asesoria consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't. They began to weaken, but the Mexican government did not 
react. When Jorge Diaz Serrano, then chief of Pemex, cut oil prices by $4 a 
barrel, he was fired. The government failed to reduce spending. Nor did it 
devalue the peso against inflation or raise interest rates to keep money in the 
country. Much of the oil money was flowing out of the country for investment 
elsewhere, while still another portion was lost to widespread corruption. 
</P>
<P>
By August, 1982, the government was bankrupt. Reserves were gone, and suddenly 
Mexico could not make payments on its now-bulging foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lack of adaptability on the part of the Mexican government when 
the crisis hit," said Heath. "They didn't adjust to world conditions." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Heath and others contend, not only is Mexico's economic cabinet 
smarter because of past errors but the Mexican economy is stronger and less 
prone to a crisis. For example, in 1982 the public deficit was 16.9% of the 
gross domestic product; by last year, the government had brought it down to 
5.8% 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the peso was 40% overvalued, economists say. Now, although the 
government is holding the peso fairly stable, observers say that at worst it is 
5% to 10% overvalued. And Mexico has more than $7 billion in reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which was 98% in 1982 and reached 159% in 1987, is about 28% now. 
</P>
<P>
While the size of the federal government grew during the 1970s and early 1980s, 
President Salinas has been selling off state enterprises and shrinking the 
bureaucracy. His government has implemented fiscal reforms and is collecting 
more taxes than its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico also has increased its other exports. Oil, which accounted for 73% of 
exports in 1982, was down to 32% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, economists say, is the attitude of international banks. While 
Mexico has begun to borrow internationally again, banks aren't likely to lend 
on the same scale as before. 
</P>
<P>
"More than guarantees against petrolization is the fact that the conditions are 
not there for the petrolization of the economy," said Carlos Ramirez. "In the 
past, petrolization was based on debt. Now the conditions are not there for the 
banks to keep lending." 
</P>
<P>
"The risks are there, but they are relative," said economist Heath. "Even in 
the worst-case scenario, Mexico is still way better off than in 1982. Too much 
has happened for things to go back the way they were." 
</P>
<P>
Mexico exports about 1.3 million barrels of oil a day. Every dollar increase in 
oil brings the government $40 million a month. Every point increase in interest 
rates costs Mexico about $70 million a month in added foreign debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the government is using the additional money to pay off internal 
debt and beef up reserves. One senior official said that Pemex will have its 
entire internal debt paid off by the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
Economists say they believe that the government will have to make concessions 
and open up the oil industry to further foreign investment in order to reach a 
free-trade agreement with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
They expect the government to allow more imports, particularly of capital 
goods, to fuel growth. But they do not expect the Salinas administration to 
launch massive investment projects that would be vulnerable to a drop in oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Heath warns that the government could be forced by elections and social 
pressure to spend more of the oil income than it should or to postpone 
devaluations and other adjustments. But even that, he says, would mean only 
that Mexico will not reach its goals on inflation and growth. It will not mean 
a crisis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil and Money 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's crude oil exports dipped sharply in the 1980s but are starting to 
rebound thanks to the crisis in the Persian Gulf.

ACTIVIST REPLACES AILING CITY AIDS COORDINATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AIDS activist Phill Wilson was appointed Los Angeles' new AIDS coordinator 
Monday, replacing Dave Johnson, who is resigning because of his personal 
struggle with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Like his predecessor, Wilson, 34, is infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus, but apparently he is in better health. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I feel fine," Wilson said during a City Hall press conference. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of his agenda, Wilson said, will be implementing the city's new AIDS 
policy, the first comprehensive plan designed to prevent the spread of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and assist people afflicted with the fatal disease. 
The policy is scheduled to come before the City Council for action in the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he plans to work with community-based organizations and within the 
city bureaucracy "to make sure the people understand what that policy's about." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the city's first AIDS coordinator, was appointed to the position 16 
months ago. Appearing with Wilson at the press conference, Johnson said he will 
continue to work for AIDS education and assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the major thing I want to get involved with -- after a little time off 
-- is the battle to get people to start caring," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, an Illinois native, has worked with AIDS and gay rights organizations 
for the last several years. Most recently, he was national training coordinator 
for the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
He earned undergraduate degrees in Spanish and theater from Illinois Wesleyan 
University before moving to Los Angeles in 1982, where he was founder and 
co-chair of the Black, Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he is black, Wilson said, will help him send a message to black 
men, whom he believes have been largely ignored by AIDS education and treatment 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he brings a special empathy to the job: He nursed his lover of 10 
years, AIDS activist Chris Brownlie, until Brownlie's death last fall. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Wilson and Brownlie operated a small gift-ware company called Black 
Is More Than Beautiful, but the enterprise became a casualty of the AIDS 
epidemic when Brownlie fell ill, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what it means to take care of someone who's dying of AIDS," Wilson 
said. "I think one of the things we have learned in this community is, if we 
are going to survive, we have to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, who appointed both Wilson and Johnson, said he has no 
misgivings about appointing another AIDS coordinator whose health is in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"If Dave served for a year, or 18 months, then had to leave, the legacy of all 
that he did while he was here is so powerful, so important, I wouldn't dare 
question how long," Bradley said. "The same is true and will be true of Phill 
Wilson."

Heavy fighting was reported in the Liberian capital of Monrovia after a West 
African peacekeeping task force, backed by Nigerian warplanes and heavy 
artillery, opened fire on Charles Taylor's rebel army in at least two suburban 
locations, including a key airfield held by the rebels. The task force also 
began taking up positions around the executive mansion, where about 1,000 
soldiers from the army of slain President Samuel K. Doe remain holed up.

Minority Serbs declared self-government in the Republic of Croatia and blocked 
roads and train lines, fueling fears that the rising confrontation could lead 
to ethnic strife, news reports and witnesses said. The Serbian National 
Council, based in the town of Knin, said it was assuming political control of 
Croatia's Serbian enclaves of about 600,000 people "to protect their human 
dignity, human and national rights." The nationalist government of Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman had no immediate response.

A $30-million Delta 2 rocket was launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., to boost a 
$65-million military navigation satellite into orbit. The rocket's payload was 
a Global Positioning System Navstar satellite, the ninth in a planned network 
of such spacecraft that ultimately will allow military forces to determine 
their location and altitude to within 53 feet anywhere in the world. The flight 
plan called for the satellite to be ejected into a preliminary elliptical 
orbit.

One strike was averted, another was settled and a third continued in school

New York City and its teachers' union reached a tentative agreement on a 
$236-million contract that would raise salaries 5.5%. The old contract, 
covering 65,000 public school teachers and 20,000 other school employees, 
expired over the weekend. School was in session Monday. A strike by public 
school teachers in New Orleans entered its third week after union negotiators 
rejected an offer. In Everett, Wash., where 460 teachers have been on strike 
since Aug. 30, negotiators assisted by three state mediators reached a 
tentative agreement.

JIM MURRAY: SUFFERING STARTS IF PAIN ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All athletes have a big problem as to what to do in the after-life, when their 
sports careers are over and it's time for the real world. Bob Golic has a 
bigger one than most. 
</P>
<P>
The Raider lineman has to find an occupation that will fill needs built up over 
two decades of nonstop football play in the most grueling position of all, 
defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Golic is going to miss the pain. Bob Golic is going to miss the Monday 
morning head buzzes, the locked knee, the twist in the lower back, the ringing 
in the ears and the overwhelming urge to throw up. 
</P>
<P>
He's going to miss the Excedrin, the throbbing in the left ankle, the knee that 
tells him when it's going to rain and the swelling in the calves, or even the 
feeling that his left shoulder is free floating. 
</P>
<P>
It's a neat problem. What do you do? See if your neighbor next door wants to 
come over and exchange head butts? Try to find somebody who will double-team 
you at the supermarket? Or who will sneak a punch in your gut and then step 
aside with an injured innocent look? Or do you just go and ride a bike on the 
Hollywood Freeway at twilight? 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy living without pain. You feel as if something is missing from 
your life. Bob Golic has been slamming into hostile, vengeful people all his 
adult life and most of his childhood. It gets addictive after a while. 
</P>
<P>
Some people like hot fudge sundaes. Others are partial to baked Alaska or 
chocolate malts. Bob Golic is addicted to having his teeth hurt. Nosebleeds are 
kind of fun, too. He has had his thumb broken so many times he always looks as 
if he's hitchhiking. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to give up a way of life. Golic can do without the crowds cheering, 
the wave, the banquets, the adulation -- but he could break down and cry when 
he realizes he's not going to be on the five-yard line against the Chicago 
Bears ever again, living the ecstasy of having his facemask ripped by some 
sociopath who is just smaller than a bus. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Golic has been wearing a helmet so much of his life only a few people know 
what color his hair is. Or even if he has any. He's hard to recognize unless 
he's lying on top of a quarterback or manhandling a halfback. In the NFL, if 
you don't have the football, nobody knows who you are. But all the flossy plays 
by the passers and wide receivers would not be possible if people like Bob 
Golic didn't get them the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Golic has been getting the ball for people since grade school. He's a 
charter member of the hall of fame at his high school, St. Joseph in Cleveland. 
At Notre Dame, he made 479 tackles, more than anyone else in the history of the 
school. Wherever the football showed up, Golic did, too. 
</P>
<P>
But crashing into other 270-pound behemoths every weekend, or every practice, 
wasn't enough for Golic. In his spare time, he wrestled. Not the Hulk Hogan 
hype wrestling, the real article, the kind where the blood isn't ketchup. He 
had a high school record of 67-14-2 and was state champion. At Notre Dame, his 
wrestling record was 54-4-1. Golic was happiest when he was either in a 
headlock or inflicting one. Some guys watch birds in their off-hours, others 
play golf. Golic preferred to throw people around -- or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Golic sat in the Raiders' locker room after Sunday's Bear game and peeled 
off the tools of combat -- yards of bloody tape, a scarred helmet, a mound of 
dirt. He grinned at the circle of microphones and note pads of the assembled 
press. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy the pounding," he said. "It's very familiar to me." 
</P>
<P>
Would he miss it? 
</P>
<P>
Golic laughed and said, "I guess I'll have to get in some dangerous occupation. 
I don't want to get bored." 
</P>
<P>
Golic might not be content with putting out oil-well fires or defusing 
terrorist bombs or even climbing the Matterhorn in street shoes. He might need 
to go out periodically and persuade someone to fetch him a karate chop, or an 
elbow in the ribs. He might have to get a friend to sink a fist in his 
mid-section, kick him in the groin, do something to take away that longing in 
his heart for the Green Bay Packers and the good old morning-after feeling, as 
if he has just been run over by a truck. 
</P>
<P>
When does the hurting from a game stop, he is asked, along about Wednesday? 
Thursday? 
</P>
<P>
"How about March?" Golic says with a wince. "How about just in time to go to 
training camp and start all over?" 
</P>
<P>
Has he always had this affinity for public suffering? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he says, grinning, "when I was a kid I used to get my father to run his 
truck into me." 
</P>
<P>
He pauses to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Naw, I'm kidding. But you have to get used to collisions. It's crowded out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Golic is typical of the acquisitions of Al Davis' Raiders. It is the policy 
to pick up skilled, crafty, still aggressive players whose own teams have 
concluded that their usefulness is over. 
</P>
<P>
Golic was a "Plan B" player with the Cleveland Browns, a veteran not protected 
on the team's 37-man untouchable roster. The Raiders picked up such explosive 
players as Lyle Alzado and John Matuszak similarly when their teams gave up on 
them. Golic, to owner Davis, was another classic example of a guy who still had 
a lot of tackles left in him, even though he made 738 in 10 years with the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Golic has had a plate in his right arm, more or less permanent game-day stomach 
cramps, and gets predictable postgame nausea. His cup runneth over. What more 
could any red-blooded American boy ask for? 
</P>
<P>
Being on the Raiders is a little slice of heaven, since opponents save their 
most homicidal attacks for them. Golic doesn't have to fear being coddled. 
Playing in a Raider line is a little like having a home on the slopes of Mt. 
St. Helens. 
</P>
<P>
Golic wouldn't have it any other way. It's kind of boring walking around and 
not having anything to heal and your stomach is at rest and the bleeding has 
stopped. I mean, if you feel good all the time, what do you have to compare it 
to? 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Golic doesn't have to worry. He only feels good in March and parts 
of April. His biggest nightmare is probably that when he retires, he will wake 
up every morning feeling like singing and without a mark on him -- and his next 
door neighbor will be a priest.

FIGHTING FAN VIOLENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SOME NFL TEAMS ARE LIMITING BEER SALES, TRAINING EMPLOYEES TO IDENTIFY ROWDIES 
AND GIVING DESIGNATED DRIVERS FREE SOFT DRINKS TO TRY TO CONTROL CROWDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New England Patriots were at the top of their game in the early 1980s when, 
on a Monday night at Foxboro Stadium, some of the fans in a capacity crowd of 
60,311 got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Picking one fight after another, they fought in the stands, and then in the 
parking lots afterward, and even on the roads home. 
</P>
<P>
Foxboro was outraged. It was the last straw in a series of incidents that 
soured government officials on Monday night games. Early the next morning, the 
town's councilmen, known as selectmen in that part of the country, took action. 
They called the NFL in New York and said, "Never again. No more Monday night 
games." 
</P>
<P>
That was nine years ago. And the NFL has since complied, ending crowd violence 
on Mondays in New England. 
</P>
<P>
But not on Sundays. Rowdy fan behavior is still a fact of life there and 
everywhere else that pro games are played. 
</P>
<P>
The rowdies are always a small fraction of the thousands at any stadium, but 
they always seem to be there. 
</P>
<P>
When it snowed in Pennsylvania last December, for example, Philadelphia Eagle 
fans threw snowballs at the visiting players and coaches, hitting many in the 
face as they stood on the sideline at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Some fans also threw snowballs and iceballs at each other, blackening a few 
eyes, and forcing the Eagles to ban beer sales at their last two games last 
winter, including the playoff game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey several years earlier, New York Jet fans built a magnificent 
bonfire in a crowded seating section of Giants Stadium, burning scores of game 
programs and dozens of hats and caps. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a busy night for the cops," George Young, general manager of the 
Giants, recalled the other day. "First they put out the fire, and then the 
drunks." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that the incidents of recent Sundays at Raider games at the 
Coliseum have been no more than part of a national pattern: Some football fans 
love to fight. 
</P>
<P>
More precisely, a minute percentage will pick a fight at the drop of a beer 
cup. 
</P>
<P>
Always have and, no doubt, always will. 
</P>
<P>
Is it getting worse, and are team and stadium officials doing anything about 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Is there a link to alcohol, and if so, should beer sales be stopped? 
</P>
<P>
Within the last few days, those and other related questions were put to a 
number of U.S. stadium managers and experts in other fields. 
</P>
<P>
Their consensus observations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Crowd behavior can be effectively controlled without the prohibition of 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In general, it is being controlled. Fan violence isn't on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most NFL teams, 21 of the 28, discontinue beer sales in the third or fourth 
quarter. Seventeen teams prohibit beer sales by vendors in the seating 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most Eastern teams ban beer on Monday nights, when the games start at 9 
p.m. -- five hours after the cocktail hour begins at, say, Foxboro, where beer 
was served all evening at the Patriots' last Monday night game in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some stadiums, such as Chicago's Soldier Field, offer free soft drinks to 
the designated drivers in each carload. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fan misconduct has dropped appreciably in the stadiums where all employees, 
starting with parking lot attendants, are trained to identify potential drunks 
and rowdies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Policies leading to widespread public awareness and education are also 
increasingly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stadium problems usually begin at pregame tailgate parties, where alcohol 
consumption is difficult or impossible to police. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailgate consumption increases considerably where stadium beer sales are 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alcohol prohibition at football games means that the rights of the 
overwhelming majority of good citizens are tampered with in the effort to 
control the belligerent minority. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The question is whether there is an overriding necessity to fight a handful 
of troublemakers by discriminating against the thousands whose traditional 
game-day lunch has been the same for years of Sundays: a hot dog and a beer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When 50,000 people congregate in one area, no amount of security can 
prevent all incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't even need 50,000," Jim Dugan, manager of Chicago's Soldier Field, 
said. "You can have a bloody fight at a mall, or on the sidewalk in front of 
Nordstrom." 
</P>
<P>
And, said Michael Rowe, manager of Giants Stadium at East Rutherford, N.J., "A 
fight can boil up in seconds. That's the tough thing about stadium security. 
Trouble happens so fast. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have 10 security guards in front of section A when a fight starts in 
section B, none of them can get there in time to keep a guy from getting 
knocked unconscious -- if the (assailant) is determined enough." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Young, Dugan and Rowe in discussing the problem recently were Brian 
O'Donovan, manager of Foxboro Stadium; Greg Asbury, manager of the Rose Bowl; 
Norman Braman, owner of the Eagles; Jerry Sachs, vice president of the 
Washington Bullets of the NBA, and other crowd-control experts in San 
Francisco, Oakland, San Diego, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MORE OR LESS? 
</P>
<P>
At the start of a new decade of pro football, the fan-violence problem 
apparently isn't getting worse. Nor is it getting much better, most observers 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more (rowdies) today, but there's also better security," Giant 
General Manager Young said. "So I'd say it's a standoff, about the same as it's 
been since the '40s, when I started going to pro games." 
</P>
<P>
A Raider season-ticket holder, Don Bohana, said: "There are always a few 
fights. Fans have been fighting at the Coliseum ever since my first (Ram) game 
there, when I went with my dad in the days of Dan Towler and Tank Younger. It's 
no worse now -- except for the one incident (Sept. 23) when a guy was 
blind-sided, hit from behind, knocked out. You handle that not by banning beer 
but by throwing the book at criminals who make unprovoked attacks." 
</P>
<P>
At the Rose Bowl, which has stopped selling beer at UCLA games this season, 
Asbury disagrees with the majority on fan misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"Our impression is that it's generally on the rise (nationally) except in 
stadiums where beer is (prohibited)," Asbury said. "We've been surprised to 
find that fights and arguments have dropped to almost nothing here this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Said UCLA season-ticket holder Jackie Leebody: "It's just more fun to sit at a 
game where nobody is sloshing beer around." 
</P>
<P>
USC's leaders are also on the side of prohibition. But they have found that a 
beer ban is easier to arrange in Pasadena, where there's a demand for it, than 
Los Angeles, where there isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Said USC Athletic Director Mike McGee: "We haven't had any serious problems in 
the four years since (Coliseum beer sales) were restricted to two cups, and 
prohibited entirely in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Browne, the NFL's vice president of communications and development, said: 
"The thing that's changed in the last year or two is that there's more 
awareness of the (fan-misconduct) problem in all arenas and stadiums by all pro 
sports. So things are improving. There are fewer (fights). One reason it might 
not seem (so) is that people are more inclined to report an incident now. There 
are more statistics." 
</P>
<P>
At Chicago, Soldier Field Manager Dugan said: "We had 11 evictions at our last 
game but not a single arrest during the (Bear-Minnesota) game. Last year, we 
often had four or five arrests. I think there's improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack Teele, assistant to the president of the San Diego Chargers, who for 
many years was assistant to the president of the Rams: "Our crowds are better 
behaved than the Ram crowds I used to see. Of course, we always have a few 
fights when the Raiders come to town." 
</P>
<P>
At Foxboro, Stadium Manager O'Donovan is concerned that a downturn in the 
economy will soon adversely affect crowd behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"When times are bad, you get more casual fans," he said. "It's like the 
preseason, when you also get a different kind of fan -- and more problems -- 
when season-ticket holders are on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Casual fans are less fanatic about football, and more interested in making it 
Party City for a day. They're more boisterous, and there are more fights. 
Unemployment and job insecurity contribute to unruly behavior. People escaping 
reality and all that. I'm pulling for a boom in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHO AND WHY? 
</P>
<P>
Football fan fighting today is more common than, for instance, movie-theater 
brawling for several good reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Issue 1: 
</P>
<P>
"At a football game, most spectators are passionately attached to their team," 
Giants Stadium Manager Rowe said. "The depth of their attachment is often 
underrated. And if they like one team, they definitely don't like the other 
team. They especially don't like the other team's fans. That's an explosive 
mix. It doesn't take much to set them off." 
</P>
<P>
Raider fan Bohana said: "Taunting is too strong a word. They aren't taunting 
you when they wear a Bronco hat or T-shirt. The unfortunate guy who got slugged 
in the Coliseum wasn't taunting anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just walking around in a Pittsburgh T-shirt, having fun, smiling and 
waving happily." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, at a 1990 game, that can be explosive. 
</P>
<P>
Issue 2: 
</P>
<P>
"The problem for stadium management is that the problem begins before the fans 
get inside," Dugan said at Soldier Field. "They get loaded at tailgate parties. 
And at night games, they come here directly from a bar." 
</P>
<P>
Said O'Donovan: "Industry-wide, 80% of our trouble is related to tailgating. It 
wouldn't help much to get rid of beer because the guy who walks in sober causes 
almost no problems even after two or three beers." 
</P>
<P>
Issue 3: 
</P>
<P>
It's a different world today. Although the Raiders had a black-hat reputation 
in Oakland a dozen years ago, their fans weren't as tough as Los Angeles fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the board of directors in those days," said George Vukasin, president 
of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. "And fan control was never an issue 
when the Raiders were in Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
Vukasin remembers that Raider fans weren't even ejected when caught smoking 
marijuana under the stands at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"The police (just) talked to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The change since then in fan behavior is, in the view of Rowe and other stadium 
managers, a natural result of the changes in American social behavior since the 
early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen years ago, when football fans had to go to the bathroom, they went to 
the bathroom," Rowe said at Giants Stadium. "Today, they don't care where they 
go. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that a football fan got mad when another fan said something 
unkind about his date -- but it wasn't worth fighting about. You just exchanged 
a few angry words. Today, a mild insult can start a real brawl. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight, 10, 15 years ago, if you were wearing a Raider cap, a ruffian was a guy 
who might try to knock it off. Today, he tries to knock your head off. 
</P>
<P>
"Or he might ask you for a match, and set your hat on fire. Or he might use it 
for a bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't have much regard for other people's property anymore in any 
public place, including the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't stay in the closet, either, anymore. It used to be that if you were 
a man of a few vices, or if you had a deviant lifestyle, you left it home when 
you went to the game. You were just out for a diversion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that 95% or more of the people are still out for a diversion -- but 
that other group, they bring their negative lifestyle with them." 
</P>
<P>
In short, it's a tougher world. 
</P>
<P>
And, said Rowe: "(To) survive, stadium security people have had to get tougher, 
too, a lot tougher. I think the stadiums are keeping the lid on (troublemakers) 
as tight as ever, probably tighter, but they couldn't do it if they weren't 
twice as tough and demanding as they once were." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT, WHERE? 
</P>
<P>
Facing repeated instances of rowdy fan behavior around the country, how are the 
pro clubs and the stadium people battling it? 
</P>
<P>
At Philadelphia last winter, when Eagle fans wouldn't stop throwing snowballs, 
club owner Norman Braman intervened. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was obviously alcohol-related, so we persuaded the city council to 
suspend the sale of beer," he said. "We were a dry stadium in our last (two 
games). 
</P>
<P>
"This year (the Eagles) wanted to make the (beer ban) permanent. But it's a 
city stadium, and they showed me that it would be an economic hardship on the 
concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
"Without beer, the concession people would lose hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. You also have to consider that a (ban) would deprive many people in 
the law-abiding majority. 
</P>
<P>
"So we compromised. We allow beer now under certain very restricted 
circumstances. And I must say that the results have surprised me. The incidence 
of (misconduct) at our stadium has dropped dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
Braman attributes the improvement to six changes: smaller and fewer beers per 
person, no beer in the second half, rigid inspections at the entrance gates, 
strict policing in the tailgate areas, vigorous prosecution of offenders, and 
"the installation of numerous Porto-Toilets." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mimi Box, Eagle vice president: "We've only had one physical altercation 
in the (stands) in three games. That's a major improvement -- although we're 
still ejecting (offenders) for minor things like pot smoking and public 
urination." 
</P>
<P>
Beer restrictions similar to Philadelphia's -- including a two-beer limit -- 
are also in place this season at most other NFL stadiums, although, at Foxboro, 
there are three exceptions, Manager O'Donovan, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the right time to cut beer sales is 15 minutes into the second half," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We also evict (those) who try to smuggle alcohol in. Most stadiums just 
confiscate it. We evict. 
</P>
<P>
"Our person-to-person program has also been successful. We hold the 
season-ticket holder personally responsible for any problem caused by the 
individuals in his seats, whether he was at the game or not. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, we contact the (offending) ticket holder personally during the 
week. We also sit down next to him at the next game, and let him know that such 
behavior won't be tolerated. If the (misconduct) is repeated, you can lose your 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco, corresponding security policies have been initiated at 
Candlestick Park, Murlan Fowell, a 49er executive, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We send all season-ticket applicants a flyer informing them that they're 
responsible for the actions of anyone in their seat," Fowell said. "We (mean) 
intoxication, abusive or foul language, and things like (fighting). 
</P>
<P>
"One (incident) puts their season tickets in jeopardy. It makes them more 
guarded in who they sell their tickets to." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have had only one serious altercation in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the day that (Bear Coach) Mike Ditka hit a fan with his bubble gum," 
Fowell said. 
</P>
<P>
The problems are a little different at Washington's RFK Stadium, Manager Jim 
Dalrymple said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sold out every game for 27 years, so a Redskin crowd is somewhat older 
and more mature," he said. "And the problem sections are easy to (identify) 
here. They're the visitors' side and the end zone. We didn't have one incident 
of fan violence last season." 
</P>
<P>
Three kinds of security forces are used at most NFL stadiums, including his, 
said Dalrymple, who brings in 30 or 40 city police, 45 uniformed security 
guards, and 125 security helpers known in most places as yellow jackets. 
</P>
<P>
At East Rutherford, N.J., Rowe was one of many stadium managers who declined to 
place a number on the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance adjusters would like to know that," he said. "Basically, in our 
three-level stadium, we could put a guard in every section in every tier, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"But we use them mostly to patrol the aisles. Nothing is more conducive to 
obeying the law than the sight of a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"In the stadium numbers game, no amount of security is (enough). They always 
outnumber you. Five hundred is a lot of cops -- but that (means) that there are 
70,000 of them and 500 of you." 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, Dugan has concluded that the most effective weapons against rowdy 
behavior at Soldier Field are public awareness and education. 
</P>
<P>
"When they understand that eviction is certain, there are fewer incidents," 
Dugan said. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL, which agrees, began a nationwide public service campaign last December 
with 60-second television commercials featuring Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly 
and former Ram safety Nolan Cromwell. 
</P>
<P>
This year most of the commercials are being inserted during Sunday games, NFL 
Vice President Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
"The theme of the announcements is 'Don't Rock the Boat,' which is a takeoff on 
a song in 'Guys and Dolls,' " Browne said. "The song and the commercial are 
(aimed at) rudeness, drinking, swearing." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said: "The campaign is aimed at the (stadium) 
minority who make things uncomfortable for other spectators." 
</P>
<P>
Any campaign against fan misconduct is most successful when each stadium 
employee is, in effect, a security guard, in the opinion of Jerry Sachs, the 
Washington Bullets' executive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what works best," he said. "It's been shown that there is very little 
(rowdiness) when everyone in the stadium or arena is involved in (prevention) 
-- the parking lot attendant, ticket taker, usher, vendor, top management, 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to train everybody to look for (drunks, bottles and fights), and 
to show everybody how to promptly call in (security personnel)." 
</P>
<P>
Said Giant executive Young: "The walkie-talkie is our equalizer." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Sachs, in cooperation with highway-safety groups, founded 
the national organization known as TEAM (techniques for effective alcohol 
management). 
</P>
<P>
Since then, TEAM has signed up most NBA, NHL and major league baseball clubs, 
and is working on the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Emmets, the TEAM coordinator in Los Angeles, said: "Anticipation is the 
key to preventing (disturbances)." 
</P>
<P>
At Giants Stadium, Manager Rowe readily agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, we used to hope that no problems would happen," he said. 
"Today, we're looking for problems to happen." 
</P>
<P>
He isn't often disappointed.

RAIDERS' PERSEVERANCE MAKES 4-0 LOOK BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Were it not for that 4-0 record, the Raiders might be in a shambles. They're 
knocking opponents out with one arm tied behind their back. They're doing it 
without Bo Jackson, Howie Long, Garry Lewis, Mike Dyal, Bruce Wilkerson, Mike 
Wise, Dennis Price . . . 
</P>
<P>
In order, that list includes one of the greatest athletes on the planet, a 
six-time Pro Bowl defensive end, a sensational rookie cornerback, their 
starting tight end, the starting right tackle, the Wise-guy who replaced Long, 
and another promising cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, they did it without starting strong safety Mike Harden, who was 
scratched from the lineup Saturday with a neck injury. Elvis Patterson, stale 
as yesterday's toast, stepped in for Harden and dared anyone to notice the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Bo was in town over the weekend, taking his final cuts with the Kansas City 
Royals, and you could almost hear his famous cross-training pledge all the way 
from Anaheim: Just do it. 
</P>
<P>
And the Raiders are doing it, despite a series of injuries that provide a fine 
set of excuses for losing. Except that they're winning. 
</P>
<P>
At this rate of injury, the Raiders will run out of starters before games, so 
the bleeding must end soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the rash of injuries will stop and we'll hold on until we get a lot 
of those people back," Coach Art Shell said Monday. "It makes it awfully tough, 
but we will do what we have to do to win football games. We're not going to let 
that be an excuse for us not being prepared to play." 
</P>
<P>
It says something for the Raiders' depth and resolve that they did not roll 
over as soon as Howie Long's foot did on the artificial turf in the Seattle 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys believe that they're going to find a way to win," Shell said of his 
players. "That's their philosophy. We talked about it all off-season and all 
during training camp. You've got to find a way to win. Things aren't always 
going to be rosy for you. There are going to be trying times." 
</P>
<P>
A brief injury recap, and how obstacles were hurdled: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wilkerson. The starting right tackle injured his knee in training camp and 
is eligible to return from injured reserve this week, although he probably 
needs another week of rehabilitation. Steve Wright took his place and was part 
of a unit that dominated the Chicago defensive front in Sunday's 24-10 win. 
Wright held Trace Armstrong, the NFL's sack leader before the game, to no sacks 
and no tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long. The all-pro defensive end broke his right foot against Seattle in 
Week 2 after a dominating performance in the opener against Denver. He's not 
expected back until November. Shell has used two Mikes, Wise and Charles, and 
assorted schemes in Long's place. The Raiders also took the opportunity to 
spring rookie Aaron Wallace on the league. He has four sacks in two weeks, 
including a Sunday sack of Jim Harbaugh that led to a fumble and Greg 
Townsend's touchdown. The bad news from the Bears was that Shell lost Wise with 
an ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a day-to-day thing," Shell said of Wise's injury. "The trainers think 
he'll probably be ready this week, but we're not sure about that right now." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dyal. The team's starting tight end strained his hamstring in the Seattle 
game and has since joined Long on injured reserve. Everyone has pitched in to 
help here. After Dyal went down, Marcus Allen moved to tight end for one play 
and made the key block on Greg Bell's game-winning touchdown against the 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
Ethan Horton has replaced Dyal for now. The team also signed Andy Parker as 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lewis. He was the surprise of training camp, a seventh-round choice who 
beat out Terry McDaniel at left corner. Lewis broke his collarbone against 
Pittsburgh Sept. 23 and remains on injured reserve. McDaniel has returned to 
his old position, so the team doesn't suffer much here, even though McDaniel 
was burned deep Sunday on an 80-yard reception by Dennis Gentry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harden. He injured his neck against Pittsburgh, but was expected to start 
against Chicago. Shell made the decision to hold him out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to be careful with it," Shell said. "He aggravated it last 
Sunday and we just wanted to make sure. We didn't want to throw him to the 
wolves." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, released by teams on two coasts in his career -- the New York Giants 
and San Diego Chargers -- has found refuge in the Raider secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are finding ways to win," Shell said. "If a guy goes down, somebody 
has to step in and play. . . . Yes, we have more depth, we have better 
personnel. We're better than we were last year."

BASEBALL, PUBLIC COMPETE FOR CANSECO'S ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM LAYDEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 6:14 on a pure New England evening -- too late for summer's heat, too 
soon for autumn's chill -- when Jose Canseco clomps up the steps of the 
third-base dugout at Fenway Park, the last of 38 Oakland Athletics players and 
coaches to reach the playing field. He is hit with a bomb of juvenile 
caterwauling, such as might precede New Kids on the Block launching into a 
concert or, to hear it another way, Ravashing Rick Rude climbing through the 
ropes. His teammates glance furtively, and return to their work. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco stops first and shakes hands with Dave Boutin, a wheelchair-bound 
21-year-old. "Hi Dave, Jose Canseco," he says before signing a small crate of 
items for Boutin, including three caps, an authentic jersey, dozens of baseball 
cards and a poster. Meanwhile, at the rail between the dugout and home plate, 
the throng is 10-deep, pressed against the wall, waving paraphernalia at 
Canseco. He turns toward them to oblige. "This," a security guard said, 
"presents a unique problem." 
</P>
<P>
All the while they wave pens and markers and Canseco makes his way from one end 
to the other. The big kids -- the bald ones -- try to stick a hand through 
beneath a child's arm, as if to mix embarrassment with worship. It all ends in 
time for Canseco to hit, which, lord knows, he needs to do at this point, with 
his one home run in 24 games and his batting average having free fallen from 
.320 to the mid-.280s in less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart, the reliable pitcher whose four consecutive 20-win seasons and 
unfailing professionalism form much of the substance of the World Champion A's, 
has seen this movie, too. He has seen Canseco hit home runs of indescribable 
dimensions, seen him work crowds in every American League city, seen him spout 
bombast to a writer, only to sulk at seeing it in print the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one player who's always got something, from day to day, that causes 
him not to be into the game," Stewart said. "When he's into the game, it's 
great to have him on your ballclub. But so many things interfere with him 
performing at his best. He never goes into a game undistracted." 
</P>
<P>
Carney Lansford, the A's veteran third baseman, said, "Jose has to go out and 
do his job, baseball-wise, be a little less obliging. You're getting paid to 
play baseball, you're not getting paid to sign autographs or do interviews. 
When you play 162 games a year, the thing you have to do most is stay mentally 
and physically fresh. You can get burned out very easily." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, if only they understood. Jose Canseco is different from them. Not different 
only in the Gatsby sense -- richer, by millions, even than his wealthy 
teammates -- but different in the sense that he plays a different game and 
lives in a world that is different from everybody else's in his sport. Perhaps 
Michael Jordan would understand. Or Magic Johnson. Sure, Michael and Magic. 
They would understand. Joe Montana, too. They would know what it will be like 
this week when the postseason begins and the spotlight shines brightest. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the $23.5 million contract that pays him $5.5 million this 
season alone and makes him richer than any player in the game (and richer, too, 
than several midwestern states). It is not just the numbers -- past, present 
and future -- such as 40-40, 50-50 and whatever-whatever. It is not just the 
hair, the eyes, the chest, the arms. It is not just 1-900-ASK-JOSE or a 
secluded house in the hills or the beautiful wife or the past problems with 
fast cars and loaded guns. It is all of these. 
</P>
<P>
'What will people remember me for?" Canseco said, repeating a question. "The 
most memorable thing is that I was a trend-setter. I was someone who set the 
standards for the future. I was someone who wasn't afraid to voice his opinion, 
who lived through all the criticism. I was exciting to watch. Someone who, if 
he had to be replaced, would be very difficult to replace. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," he said, "this whole game is going Hollywood. Fans want to have a good 
time; they won't want to go to the ballpark if none of the players are known. 
So what if a guy hits a home run? We don't know him. They want to see Canseco. 
He keeps them entertained. Whether they want to boo him or cheer him, they get 
into the game." 
</P>
<P>
Tough work, you understand, to take the game of baseball and carry it into the 
21st century all by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Talent started all of this. Canseco is 6-foot-3, 230 pounds, meaty and sculpted 
at the same time. "Best bat speed I've ever seen," said A's hitting coach Merv 
Rettenmund, repeating an assessment he has offered many times. Willie Randolph, 
the venerable former New York Yankee and current Athletic, said, "He misses 
balls and has them go out. Reggie could do that, but Reggie was just force, as 
strong as an ox. He didn't have nearly the bat speed that Jose does." 
</P>
<P>
On it goes. The stories get repeated like when college chums gather at reunions 
and talk about the beer they consumed -- his 550-foot shot into the fifth deck 
at the SkyDome in Toronto, his rising liner that Baltimore Oriole third baseman 
Craig Worthington jumped at ... just as it cleared the wall, batting practice 
moonshots for show. In 1985, he was American League Rookie of the Year; in '88, 
he made good on a prediction to become the game's first (and still only) 40-40 
man, with 42 home runs and 40 stolen bases. He has promised more, and at age 
26, his body willing, is capable of delivering. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt," Stewart said. "I listen to all the things he says about himself, 
and there's no doubt. I can honestly say that, physically, he has no limits." 
</P>
<P>
Production and promises, however, have given birth to another monster. In his 
incessant desire to match -- and better -- his feats and predictions, Canseco 
is given to impetuousness and immaturity. And predictably, each incident is 
magnified beyond realism. It comes with the territory and he knows it. When he 
arrived late to Yankee Stadium and blamed a cab driver for taking him on a 
two-hour tour, it was the stuff of sidebars and whimsy. "Because," Canseco 
said. "I'm ... big ... news." 
</P>
<P>
This he says with much bravado and self-confidence, as if partly burdened and 
partly proud. In truth, he is more complex than this. Much more creative and 
sophisticated, too. He spends most of his public time alternately brandishing 
the enormous chip on his shoulder and then removing it to ask for 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the uniqueness of Jose Canseco reveals itself on a daily basis," A's 
general manager Sandy Alderson said. "Sometimes in a positive light, sometimes 
not." 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland A's might be the best baseball team of this generation. Beginning 
with this week's playoffs, they will be odds-on favorites to repeat as American 
League and World Champions, the first team to win consecutive World Series 
since the Yankees of '77 and '78, and the first team to play in three straight 
Series since the same Yankees (1976-78). On this team, with 14 past or present 
All-Stars and with a payroll that could soon surpass $30 million, a guy could 
get lost. 
</P>
<P>
The team, in short, is close to digging a place in history and rooting itself 
forever. Canseco is another matter. For all his glitter, he is still just five 
seasons old, possessor of 160 home runs, 94 stolen bases and a career .270 
batting average. His promises of 50-50 are nothing more than howling in the 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to eventually leave himself short," Stewart said. "He's never going to 
be able to play his game like he's capable with everything else he does. I 
don't care what his statistics are. He's been great. I know that. But he's 
still got more."

KINGS DEAL MAKELA TO SABRES, GET BUSKAS IN WAIVER DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
As the Kings made one of their many trips through customs last season, an 
airport official stopped left wing Mikko Makela when the hockey player 
attempted to put his camera through an X-ray machine. 
</P>
<P>
"What is that camera's ASA?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously unsure what the official was talking about, the Finnish-born Makela, 
hoping to gain immunity through his status, declared, "I'm with the team." 
</P>
<P>
No longer. 
</P>
<P>
After struggling unsuccessfully for a year to become an effective part of the 
team, Makela was traded to the Buffalo Sabres Monday for left wing Mike 
Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings sent Donnelly to their New Haven farm team. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the Kings picked up veteran defenseman Rod Buskas from the 
Pittsburgh Penguins in the NHL waiver draft. 
</P>
<P>
Each club was allowed to protect 18 skaters and two goalies. The Kings, 
drafting 12th, got Buskas, but didn't lose anybody when the other 20 teams 
failed to select one of their unprotected players. 
</P>
<P>
The Makela experiment began with high hopes when the Kings traded Ken 
Baumgartner and Hubie McDonough to the New York Islanders last November for 
him. In a little more than four seasons with the Islanders, Makela scored 95 
goals and 219 points. His best year was 1987-88, when he scored 36 goals and 
had 76 points. 
</P>
<P>
But the old Makela never was seen with the Kings. Even playing on Wayne 
Gretzky's line, Makela did not find his old form. 
</P>
<P>
He played 45 games with the Kings, scoring seven goals and assisting on 14. 
</P>
<P>
By playoff time, Makela was little more than a highly paid tourist, shooting 
pictures of the Banff countryside while the Kings prepared for the Calgary 
Flames. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the one great year," said King General Manager Rogie Vachon. "He had 
all the tools, but, for some reason, he lost his touch around the net and then 
lost his confidence. He was not good defensively, so if he didn't have the 
offense, he couldn't help you much." 
</P>
<P>
A 5-11, 185-pounder, Donnelly spent the better part of the last two seasons 
with Buffalo's Rochester farm team. 
</P>
<P>
With their season opener Thursday, the Kings sent goalie Mario Gosselin, 
wingers Keith Crowder, Brian Lawton and Kyosti Karjalainen and center Mikael 
Lindholm to their Phoenix farm club.

NASCAR DRIVER MOROSO DIES IN CRASH ON HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just a few hours after driving 250 miles in a NASCAR Winston Cup stock car race 
Sunday, Rob Moroso was killed in a highway accident near his home in 
Mooresville, N.C., while returning from the race. 
</P>
<P>
Moroso, 22 last Thursday, was the 1989 Busch Grand National champion and this 
season was a leading candidate for Winston Cup rookie of the year. He finished 
20th in the Holly Farms 400 Sunday at North Wilkesboro, N.C., driving an 
Oldsmobile owned by his father, Dick Moroso. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going west on North Carolina 150, started into a curve and apparently 
lost control, sliding sideways," said Roger Smith, a North Carolina state 
trooper. "Apparently he was traveling at a high rate of speed, went sideways 
and couldn't correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Smith attended the race in which Moroso drove earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Moroso's sliding car was struck on the driver's door by an eastbound car. Tammy 
Williams, 27, of China Grove, N.C., the driver of the other car, also was 
killed. The accident occurred about midnight, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Bryant of Matthews, N.C., Moroso's 26-year-old girlfriend, was injured 
and was taken to the Carolinas Regional Medical Center for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Moroso, a race track owner and former national drag racing champion who 
owns Moroso Performance, Inc., managed his son's career since he began 
competing in NASCAR's Daytona Dash series when he was 18. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a shock right now and is a loss we will feel even more in the days and 
weeks to come, I'm sure," Dick Moroso said. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held Thursday at Charlotte Motor Speedway, the site 
of Moroso's finest racing accomplishments. He won two Grand National races 
there in 1989 and earlier this year was runner-up to Dick Trickle in the 
Winston Open. 
</P>
<P>
Although originally from Madison, Conn., the Morosos maintained a residence and 
racing shop in Mooresville and also own motorsports parks in West Palm Beach, 
Fla., and Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"Rob was one of the most promising young drivers in Winston Cup racing, so from 
that standpoint it's a terrible loss for everyone who enjoys the sport," said 
Raymond Beadle, owner of the Blue Max team that won the Winston Cup 
championship last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, though, it really hits hard because his dad is one of my best 
friends in racing, and I know how badly he and the rest of the family are 
hurting right now. Someone that young, it's a real tragic situation." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Moroso, in addition to managing his son's career, was crew chief on the 
car since Jake Elder left the team in mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always tried to hire the best people I can get for the team," Dick 
Moroso said recently when asked about managing his son. "I didn't have much 
choice with Rob, but he's turned out pretty good."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's see if I've got this straight. The National League championship series 
opens Thursday. The American League championship series opens Saturday. The 
National League gets Saturday and Sunday off. The American League rests on 
Monday. Heaven help baseball if it dared to interfere with CBS' college and pro 
football schedule. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the Dodgers sign Darryl Strawberry, they'll win the National League pennant 
next season. If the Giants sign Strawberry, they'll win the pennant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With all of Kal Daniels' injuries and history of knee operations, it's amazing 
he was leading the Dodgers in home runs and runs batted in when a partially 
collapsed lung ended his season in San Francisco Friday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee's combined NL and AL batting average going into Monday night's 
Oakland-Angel game was .324. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If McGee and teammate Rickey Henderson sweep the batting titles, they'll be the 
first from the same city to do so since the Boston Red Sox's Ted Williams and 
the Braves' Ernie Lombardi in 1942. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart won't win the Cy Young Award, but he is good enough to be the 
starting pitcher for the A's in the first game of the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How hard is it to hit 50 home runs? The club record of one of baseball's most 
successful franchises, the Dodgers, is 43 by Duke Snider in 1956. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's Doug Drabek has more complete games than the Blue Jays' staff. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
A star at the new Comiskey Park could be first baseman Frank Thomas, who played 
football at Auburn with Bo Jackson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Security at the old Comiskey was terrific over the weekend. The park wasn't 
dismantled by the fans, leaving memorabilia for either the club or salvage 
company to dispense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Diego should keep Tony Gwynn and get rid of Jack Clark. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Denis Potvin and Jeff Bridges. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Allen is such an outstanding blocker that he should be moved to fullback 
again when Bo Jackson returns to pursue his hobby. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of the Raiders' greatest draft picks was Greg Townsend in the fourth round 
in 1983. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Credit Raider assistant coach Mike White with improving Jay Schroeder's 
mechanics. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rypien's injury that gave Stan Humphries the quarterback job could be a 
blessing for the Washington Redskins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New York Giant Coach Bill Parcells argued with defensive coordinator Bill 
Belichick on the sideline late in Sunday's game against Dallas. Parcells wanted 
to take Lawrence Taylor out of the game, but Belichick said Taylor wanted to 
stay in. Taylor got his way. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bill Nicholas, retired general manager of the Coliseum, will be honored 
Saturday night before the USC-Washington State game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC sophomore tailback Mazio Royster, who rushed for 70 yards against Ohio 
State, was named after a member of James Brown's band. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who would have thought Rice and Oregon State would hold Houston and Nebraska to 
a total of 55 points Saturday? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Name Game: Bakersfield College defensive back Bobby Gridiron. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan is only the 10th-highest paid player in the NBA and will drop 
once rookies Derrick Coleman and Gary Payton sign. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Give the edge to the Houston Rockets in the trade that brought them Kenny Smith 
and Roy Marble from the Atlanta Hawks for John Lucas and Tim McCormick. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Levingston, the free-agent forward who will not be re-signed by Atlanta, 
has been offered $2.4 million for three years by the Chicago Bulls and $1 
million for one year by a team in Greece. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Injuries haven't been very kind to the Breeders' Cup. First, Easy Goer. Then 
Sunday Silence. Now, Housebuster. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Olympia, Lee Haney, has Evander Holyfield bench pressing 300 pounds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, the California State Athletic Commission has licensed 
Dan Goossen as both a manager and promoter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lou Duva would like to have Pernell Whitaker defend his lightweight title 
against International Boxing Federation junior lightweight champion Tony Lopez, 
but promoter Don Chargin says he's working on a Lopez-Brian Mitchell 
unification match for February in Sacramento. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Track promoter Al Franken wants to know why Miami Dolphin tackle Brian Sochia 
was suspended five weeks by the NFL after testing positive for steroids -- and 
sprinter Ben Johnson was banned for two years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pity the folks who sat in the front row at the Raider-Bear game behind 7-0 
Benoit Benjamin and 6-9 Magic Johnson, who were standing on the sideline. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New England Patriot owner Victor Kiam passes the blame a lot better than his 
team passes the ball.

ALL THOSE MILLIONS FOR JOHN WILLIAMS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THE NBA COUNTS ITS BLESSING AND FRETS IN THE WAKE OF HOT ROD'S 
HISTORIC SEVEN-YEAR, $26.5 MILLION CONTRACT WITH THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ALDRIDGE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The highest-paid player in the NBA wasn't home. In fact, he was in Seattle. His 
mother took a message. It was surprising, she was told, that given the recent 
past, she didn't now have someone answer the phone for her. 
</P>
<P>
"No indeed," Barbara Colar said by telephone from Sorrento, La. "Nothing like 
that. I answer my telephone. I can do that myself." 
</P>
<P>
If you haven't heard, John "Hot Rod" Williams, Cleveland Cavaliers forward, got 
a raise this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he earned around $600,000 as a sixth man who, because of injuries 
to his mates, became a starter for most of the year. This upcoming season, 
Cleveland will pay him $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are the big winner after Williams decided Monday night not to 
accept a trade to Seattle for Xavier McDaniel and Nate McMillan. He had this 
opportunity as part of his historic seven-year, $26.5 million contract, which 
makes Williams the second-highest-paid individual in any team sport. He will 
make more money in the next 12 months in salary than Michael Jordan, more than 
Wayne Gretzky, more than Darryl Strawberry, more than anyone except Jose 
Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the Cavaliers' idea. But the Miami Heat forced their hand by 
signing Williams, a restricted free agent, to an offer sheet last month. 
Cleveland had the right to match the offer and keep Williams's services, and on 
Sept. 6, Cleveland did. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Embry, Williams's boss as general manager of the Cavaliers, was sitting 
down when he heard the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've grown to understand it," he said. "I anticipated that Miami was going to 
tender an offer sheet. I had spoken with Billy (Cunningham, the Heat's 
co-owner) after they extended the offer. ... It was structured in a way that he 
felt we wouldn't match." 
</P>
<P>
It's the ultimate in being in the right place at the right time. Williams, who 
was not available to comment, is just the latest beneficiary of the NBA's 
lucrative free-agent system. No one, not his teammates, not his general 
manager, not the Gund brothers, who own the Cavaliers, seems to hold any of it 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I would have said to you a year ago that I thought we would be 
making this much money," said Williams's agent, Chicago-based Mark Bartelstein. 
</P>
<P>
No one did. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA hasn't had a whiff of labor trouble since the late Larry Fleisher and 
the owners' Labor Relations Committee worked out the collective-bargaining 
agreement of 1988. The core of the deal gave the players 53 percent of gross 
revenues. Despite the salary cap, established in 1985 to bring teams closer 
together in what they spent for players, the 53 percent rule brought 
unparalleled riches to the players. 
</P>
<P>
Miami needed a veteran to complement its young nucleus, and without any 
established superstars to command high salaries, it had the money. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't make it all right with everyone else. League rules frown on 
publicly criticizing another team's work, but no one is very happy with the 
potential financial pitfalls of paying anyone other than the one-name wonders 
-- Jordan, Bird, Magic -- this kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
"Now sometimes you can get too excessive," Washington Bullets owner Abe Pollin 
said of the Williams deal. "I don't know if we reached that or if we're going 
to reach that. This particular contract, in my mind, is ridiculous. That kind 
of money for that kind of player doesn't make any sense. And I would tell my 
fellow owners that in a meeting. The front-loading is part of it. The entire 
salary structure as dictated by the salary cap makes some sense, but somehow 
there's got to be some sense in it other than the cap -- what the worth of a 
player is in the whole structure of things." 
</P>
<P>
When Magic Johnson signed for 25 years and $25 million in the early '80s, a lot 
of people thought the Los Angeles Lakers were insane. Now, every general 
manager in the league would love to make that deal for his superstar player. 
</P>
<P>
Lakers General Manager Jerry West said recently: "The thing is that he 
(Williams) gets $9 million in one year, which is a hell of a lot of money." 
(The way Williams's contract is set up, he is paid the first and second years 
of the deal in the first 12 months.) 
</P>
<P>
"But he's a great player," West continued. "He can play three positions. The 
players bargained for 53 percent. Why should it shock anybody anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
"All it means is we've got to respond to that," Bullets General Manager John 
Nash said. "There aren't many players who would fit in the caliber of John 
Williams. His contract falls more in line than Jon Koncak's. I'd rather have 
his contract than Koncak's in terms of return on your dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Only in the last couple of years has the underside of it all begun to show. In 
matching Williams's offer, and redoing the contracts of guard Mark Price, 
center Brad Daugherty and forward Larry Nance, the Cavaliers are near $3 
million over the league salary cap of $11.8 million this season. (Teams are 
allowed to exceed the cap in order to re-sign their own free agents.) 
</P>
<P>
Terry Porter got $13.5 million over five years last season to play point guard 
for Portland, but had a great year and outstanding playoffs. No one complained. 
Atlanta's Koncak had no such luck. Last season, he did exactly what he had done 
in the first four years of his NBA career -- a handful of points and rebounds 
-- and was booed at home, because he was the recipient of a six-year, $13.2 
million contract. And the lingering resentment over the deal still troubles the 
Hawks' chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
General managers are terrified about the internal damage a big contract can do. 
Since the Lakers signed Sam Perkins for $18 million for six years, James Worthy 
has made overtures about having his contract redone. 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, the Mavericks headed off potential trouble with their acquisitions 
of Fat Lever and Rodney McCray and redid the contracts of both Rolando Blackman 
and Derek Harper, their starting back court. Blackman made $1.1 million last 
year and had seven years remaining on his contract; Harper made $850,000 and 
had eight years left. Utah's Karl Malone has made a career out of redoing his 
contracts and just restructured his deal again. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pollin: "Once you get a player that is, in my opinion, completely 
overpaid, then you start shaking up the whole structure of salaries. ... It's a 
negative for everybody, including the players in the long run. Because if 
things aren't on an even keel, (make) economic sense, it isn't any good for 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Williams's deal came on top of Cleveland's opening the vault to import Danny 
Ferry from Il Messaggero of Italy. Price, whose five-year, $5 million contract 
of two years ago sent shudders through the league -- Atlanta General Manager 
Stan Kasten called it "one dumb contract" -- was middle of the pack until the 
Cavaliers quickly redid his contract. And Daugherty's. And Nance's. 
</P>
<P>
The true domino effect. 
</P>
<P>
Said New York Knicks General Manager Al Bianchi: "The obvious perception is, 
'Is this guy worth the money?' But we don't look at it like that anymore. The 
league was in an uproar when Koncak was signed, and when Price signed, and when 
Patrick (Ewing) signed. ... If someone's out there and someone wants to pay it, 
you can't blame the agents and the players. Whatever the problems are and the 
predicaments are, we've created it." 
</P>
<P>
The fear of owners is, what's to keep players from asking for more when the 
current collective-bargaining agreement expires in 1993, or looking to do away 
with the cap altogether? 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was really the savior of the NBA," Pollin said of the cap. "I 
still believe it's obviously a very positive element for the NBA. ... The 
success has really been shared by the players, which was my idea at the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Said West: "There's something wrong with our system. I don't care how much the 
great players get. I know that, when you pay people who haven't played, people 
who won't play and people who haven't proved themselves, you wonder how much 
more the system can bear." 
</P>
<P>
Hot Rod Williams came into the league with the stigma of the Tulane 
point-shaving scandal fresh in the public consciousness. He maintained his 
innocence throughout the trial that helped bring down the Green Wave basketball 
program. And he was acquitted of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
Williams's four years in the league have been rock-steady, and he's one of the 
few talents capable of playing all three front-court positions. Last season was 
Williams's best; he started most of the season after injuries to Nance and 
Daugherty, posting career highs in scoring average (16.8) and rebounds (8.1). 
And Williams was the team's only consistent player against Philadelphia in the 
playoffs, averaging 19 points and 9.2 rebounds in the five-game series. Charles 
Barkley pronounced him death to guard and shoot over. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Bartelstein had spent most of the season negotiating with the 
Cavaliers. The irony of the new deal is that the Cavaliers could have signed 
him for less -- about $16 million less. Cleveland's original offer was three 
years, $4.2 million. Williams and Bartelstein balked. In January, they asked 
for five years and $10.5 million, and the Cavaliers backed off. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Cleveland came back with five years, $10.5 million. Williams said no. 
The Cavaliers got up to $12 million, but by then Williams was going to 
arbitration to try to get unrestricted free agency. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted the year he didn't play for Cleveland -- while he was on trial for 
the point shaving -- to count on his contract, which would make him an 
unrestricted free agent instead of restricted. But the arbitrator ruled in 
favor of the Cavaliers. Soon after, enter Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Offer sheets to restricted free agents are almost always matched. The first 
year of Williams's deal pays him $1 million, with a $4 million signing bonus. 
Years two, three and four pay him $4 million. He earns $3.5 million in years 
five and six, $2.5 million in the seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he has veto power on trades for one year -- thus the Seattle deal 
got nixed. If a trade is consummated during the year with his approval, 
Cleveland will have to pay a penalty of 15 percent of the value of the whole 
deal. They've already given him the $4 million signing bonus, so the Cavaliers 
would have to shell out another $3.9 million -- or 15 percent of the remaining 
$22.6 million. In other words, his payoff for agreeing to a trade this season 
would be more than the salaries of 99.9 percent of the players in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"You give those dollars to pay the players," Embry said. "That's just how the 
market works. I wasn't shocked. (Cunningham) said, 'You're in a situation where 
you have to spend money.' I said, 'You really haven't accomplished your goal 
because we're going to match.' 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the pros and cons, the return on your investment. One thing is 
certain: If you let a player go that has some value, you're not going to have a 
return on your investment." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Cleveland paid the money. But how long will the superstars wait until 
demanding new deals? Ewing has a clause in his contract that makes him a free 
agent as soon as four players make more than he does. Williams already does; 
Houston's Akeem Olajuwon will soon, and the likelihood is that others will by 
1992. The thought is frightening: How much would Ewing get in an open market? 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, this must end. The four expansion teams each paid $32.5 million to 
get in the league; their money has been doled out. Television money will now 
level off; each team will receive an average of $8 million in the next four 
years from NBC and cable's TNT. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year," said Portland Trail Blazers President Bucky Buckwalter, "we're not

It's going to be a pinch. Cable (television) in New York and L.A. picks up a 
lot of slack, but in the smaller markets it's going to be a problem."

Bob Gansler will be retained as coach of the U.S. national soccer team, the 
U.S. Soccer Federation announced. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Rothenberg, who replaced Werner Fricker as head of the federation after 
the World Cup, said he anticipated Gansler would remain as coach through the 
1994 World Cup, the first to be played in the United States. However, 
Rothenberg refused to guarantee that Gansler would remain four more years. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler took over the team in January, 1989, and led the United States to its 
first World Cup berth since 1950. However, the team lost three consecutive 
games at the World Cup and finished 23rd among 24 nations.

DEUKMEJIAN SIGNS DFG MEASURES

<P>
Among the last official acts of an outgoing governor often criticized for being 
soft on environmental issues was the signing of five bills worth $19.45 million 
to the California Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
On the last day before bills passed by the legislature this year would expire 
on his desk, Gov. George Deukmejian approved the DFG's so-called "bail-out" 
package Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Developers had lobbied hard against a key bill -- AB 3158 by Assemblyman Jim 
Costa (D-Fresno) -- that will require them to pay specified fees from $850 to 
$1,250 for each environmental report required for a project. 
</P>
<P>
That is expected to cost builders $8.2 million a year -- an expense that 
otherwise would be borne by the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
Another bill -- AB 2126 by Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) -- will cost 
commercial fishermen an additional $3.5 million in licenses and fees each year. 
</P>
<P>
Also, AB 3727 by Costa will provide $6.6 million in loans to cover a shortfall 
in the fiscal year that ended July 1. The DFG was authorized to borrow $3.6 
million from the Environmental License Plate Fund and $3 million from the 
Off-Highway Vehicle -- or "Green Sticker" -- Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian vetoed a bill that would have changed the DFG's name to the 
Department of Fish and Wildlife, shifting focus to the department's purely 
environmental role for non-hunted species. 
</P>
<P>
Before the funding bills were passed, DFG Director Pete Bontadelli had 
indicated that shortages would require the department to close two fish 
hatcheries and lay off scores of biologists -- or at best use them to fill 
vacancies in the department where their special abilities might not be 
utilized. 
</P>
<P>
Now, officials said, nobody will be laid off or transferred and only one fish 
hatchery will be closed -- the catfish hatchery at Imperial Valley, which loses 
most of its fish to predatory birds, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Mojave River hatchery at Victorville, which provides fish for Southern 
California's freshwater fisheries, will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli, a former legislative aide appointed by Deukmejian in 1987, was 
believed to be the architect of the bail-out package, in concert with 
Deukmejian, Costa and Felando. 
</P>
<P>
Two other bills sponsored by Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata) will increase 
annual revenue from hunting and fishing programs. One -- AB 2848 -- will allow 
the DFG to auction up to three permits for the tule elk hunt apart from the 
lottery drawing. 
</P>
<P>
The other -- AB 3703 -- increases the minimum fine for fishing or hunting 
without a license from $100 to $250.

BENITA VALENTE SEARCHES FOR PLACE IN OPERATIC SUN; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE POETIC SOPRANO, HAILED AS THE CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL, STILL HUNGERS 
TO SING OPERA'S PLUM ROLES. SHE OPENS WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN A TITLE ROLE IN 'ORFEO 
ED EURIDICE.'

<P>
Mystifying. That's what observers on the scene call her career. 
</P>
<P>
"And I agree with them," says Benita Valente, the sedately beauteous soprano 
who opens Wednesday night in the Music Center Opera production of "Orfeo ed 
Euridice." 
</P>
<P>
All her adult life she's been a connoisseur's singer -- known for her 
impeccable musicianship, poetic sensibility and ravishing silvery-toned voice 
-- a no-nonsense professional and a trouper. 
</P>
<P>
But for most of her career, spanning 30 years, Valente has yearned to sing 
opera, lots of it -- not spotty amounts, and certainly not just lieder recitals 
and solos with orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
"The steady (opera) invitations just never came in," she says at lunch, picking 
out vegetables from the fettucine. Her hazel eyes, wide and almond-shaped, look 
down at the plate, but there's no trace of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
True, Valente is here now for "Orfeo" and she's had a share of operatic 
triumphs in such antique repertory as Handel, and the Gluck at hand, and 
Mozart. She even sang Nannetta at the Pavilion 23 years ago -- the touring 
Sarah Caldwell production of Verdi's "Falstaff." 
</P>
<P>
"But where are the 'Bohemes' and 'Manons'?" she asks. "For some reason, company 
directors do not see me as an operatic animal. I'm not it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Valente manifests none of a diva's flamboyance or gregariousness or 
egocentrism or hysteria -- traits that seem to be necessary, to some degree, 
for portraying those ultimately vulnerable heroines who tear at an audience's 
emotions. And while she has the physical attributes of a femme fatale, that 
element of passion and to-the-brink daring does not come across onstage. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does she seem pushy offstage. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe some singers do better public relations. I just leave it to my 
management (Columbia Artists Management Inc.) and they typically report that 
the company liked me very much, even thought I was terrific, but hired someone 
else for the next production." 
</P>
<P>
A native Californian from the San Joaquin Valley, Valente is making her debut 
with the Music Center Opera. Like Marilyn Horne, in the other title role, she 
left the West Coast for a beckoning music world and made a major reputation. 
</P>
<P>
But the daughter of Italian-Swiss immigrants, the shy little girl from a 
"cotton and cows" farm near Delano, always retained a core of reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"At a very young age I discovered that my voice had an effect on everybody," 
she says, smiling. "Singing was the magic thing I could do -- it cut through 
the shyness and discomfort I felt around people." 
</P>
<P>
Her Italian-born father played Caruso records and Valente says that by the time 
she won an audition to study at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia (after 
crucial training in Santa Barbara with Lotte Lehmann, then Martial Singher) she 
knew "the whole tenor repertoire, courtesy of Caruso!" 
</P>
<P>
She plunged deep into the elitist circles of music, capturing the heart of 
Rudolf Serkin, who made her soprano-in-residence at Vermont's prestigious 
Marlboro Festival. And even though the tall, graceful brunette won the 1960 
Metropolitan Opera Auditions, that company did not engage her until 13 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
At 55, the soprano who ventures into diverse literature -- from baroque 
oratorios to German lieder to Verdi to difficult contemporary music -- has 
still not satisfied her longing for a real foothold in opera: 
</P>
<P>
"Even during what my husband (Anthony Checchia, co-administrator at Marlboro) 
and I call 'the sacrificial years' -- when he had to attend to his business in 
Philadelphia and I took our young son with me to Germany -- establishing myself 
was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I took off for 12 months and when I returned hardly anyone remembered me. 
Staying on the scene seems to be required." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the profile of this seemingly stoic but ever-sensitive singer is 
still incomplete. "Boheme" could be just around the bend. 
</P>
<P>
"After all," says Valente, "I didn't give my first Carnegie Hall recital 'til 
1987." Characteristically, she omits mentioning that it was sold out months in 
advance.

HOUSE PASSES AD LIMITS FOR CHILDREN'S TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Legislation to limit commercials on children's shows to 10 1/2 minutes an hour 
on weekends and 12 minutes on weekdays won final congressional approval Monday 
as the House voted to restore some of the rules wiped away by deregulation of 
the broadcast industry. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by voice vote, would require that broadcasters' efforts to 
offer educational and informative children's TV programming be evaluated by the 
Federal Communications Commission as a part of the periodic license renewal 
process. 
</P>
<P>
It also establishes a National Endowment for Children's Educational Television 
programming, with an authorization of $2 million in 1991 and $4 million in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Identical legislation was passed earlier by the Senate and the bill is being 
sent to the White House. President Bush is "strongly opposed" to the limits on 
advertising for fear of violating broadcasters' First Amendment rights, an 
Administration official said. But "being strongly opposed isn't the same thing 
as a veto threat," the official added, noting that a veto is doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a separate voice vote, the House gave final approval to a bill 
requiring built-in closed captioning decoders for the hearing impaired on all 
new TV sets with screens of 13 inches or more. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, if signed by the President, would go into effect July 1, 1993. 
It is expected to add between $5 and $15 to the price of a television set. The 
bill also calls on the FCC to establish standards for captions to be 
incorporated into emerging TV technology, such as high definition televisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has issued no opinion on the bill to require television sets 
to include closed-caption equipment, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A broad coalition of supporters of limits on advertising during children's 
shows, including child advocacy groups, national education associations and 
television industry executives -- predicted that the President would sign the 
bill. They said that Bush, who has proclaimed himself the "education 
President," would find it difficult to veto a bill requiring broadcasters to do 
their part in teaching children. 
</P>
<P>
New and creative shows are likely to be developed by programmers because the 
legislation would require the FCC to consider, as a part of the broadcast 
license renewal process, whether a station's "overall programming" provides 
educational and informative shows for children, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill ensures there is not exploitation of children's programming," said 
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a key sponsor of the measure. "Each and every 
TV station in the United States will have to demonstrate (that) it is serving 
the educational and instructional needs of children." 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Broadcasters, which in the past has opposed legislation 
to set curbs on advertising during children's shows, joined its critics this 
time to support the bill. "We're pleased with the outcome," a NAB spokesman 
said. "It's been a contentious issue, and we're glad to see it resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, when the FCC abolished guidelines limiting commercials on 
children's shows to 9 1/2 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes on 
weekdays, programmers have expanded the commercial time. According to a 1988 
survey by the NAB, about one in five of the programs directed to children 
averaged more than 12 minutes of commercials per hour. 
</P>
<P>
President Ronald Reagan pocket-vetoed nearly identical legislation in 1988 
after it cleared both congressional chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Edelman, executive director at Action for Children's Television, said that 
the bill will make it easier for programmers to broadcast more creative shows 
and curtail toy manufacturers from dominating the Saturday morning airways when 
children are most likely to be watching television. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for people to get a program on television for children that 
doesn't have a toy tie-in," she said. "There's not the money for it now. 
Programs are produced out of (toy companies') advertising budgets, and not out 
of (programmers') creative budgets."

FED SPURNS BUSH DEMAND FOR CUT IN INTEREST RATES 
</P>

<P>
President Bush called on the Federal Reserve Monday to push interest rates down 
in recognition of the new federal budget agreement, but officials at the 
central bank signaled that it is unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Bush portrayed the new budget accord as part of a pact between the 
Administration and the Fed and, in effect, demanded that the Fed live up to its 
part of the bargain, telling reporters at a news conference in New York: "I 
would look to the Federal Reserve to lower the rates." 
</P>
<P>
The President's remarks reflected a belief, widely held in New York and 
Washington, that the Fed would push interest rates down if a budget accord were 
reached. Bush said Monday that he believes a "good budget agreement will result 
in lower interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
But Fed officials indicated Monday that they consider the deficit-reduction 
accord inadequate and have no plans to nudge rates down when the Fed's 
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets here today. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials insisted in interviews that earlier statements by Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan have been misinterpreted and that he has never offered easier 
monetary policy in return for a budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve spokesman Joseph Coyne stressed that Greenspan has promised 
only that the central bank will let the financial markets judge the package. If 
the credit markets are pleased and short-term interest rates fall on their own, 
the Fed "won't stand in the way." 
</P>
<P>
"We never said we would ease," Coyne said. 
</P>
<P>
The financial markets turned in a decidedly mixed response to the budget accord 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more 
than 63 points on the day, buoyed both by the budget accord and by a sharp drop 
in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
But, the dollar continued to plunge on the foreign exchange markets, reflecting 
continued disappointment with U.S. economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
"The market didn't expect miracles (from the deficit agreement). They knew this 
was about as much as you could get," Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of 
Goldman Sachs International, observed. "But, if they had failed to get an 
agreement, the reaction would have been very negative." 
</P>
<P>
There was also a growing sense of disappointment among economists on Monday 
that the budget negotiators had achieved so little in the way of real spending 
cuts during their marathon talks. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which sent oil prices soaring, the Fed has 
refused to move on its own to reduce interest rates, fearful that inflation may 
spiral out of control as a result of easier monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
Some Fed officials said that they are increasingly hesitant about lowering 
interest rates because they are concerned about the rapid decline in the value 
of the dollar over the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A lower dollar increases inflationary pressures on the economy and makes it 
more difficult to attract foreign investors to help fund the federal deficit. 
Fed officials apparently are worried that lower interest rates could further 
damage the dollar's value.

"The lower dollar makes for a very narrow path for the Fed to follow," one 
official said. "It makes the policy environment very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Other economists agreed that the Fed is unlikely to ease monetary policy, 
largely because the new budget agreement will result in only a slight reduction 
in the deficit this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement calls for much larger cuts later in a five-year plan, 
economists say they believe the Fed is skeptical that those long-term targets, 
which rely heavily on unspecified spending cuts, will ever be met. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the financial markets seemed at least to display relief Monday that an 
agreement had been reached.

BUSH HINTS AT WAY OUT OF PERSIAN GULF CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT SUGGESTS THAT IRAQI WITHDRAWAL FROM KUWAIT COULD OPEN DOOR 
TO ARAB-ISRAELI SETTLEMENT.

Offering the first hint of a U.S. plan to seek a diplomatic solution to the 
crisis in the Persian Gulf, President Bush told the United Nations General 
Assembly on Monday that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait could open the way for 
peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"In the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional withdrawal," Bush said, "I truly 
believe that there may be opportunities: For Iraq and Kuwait to settle their 
differences permanently, for the states of the gulf themselves to build new 
arrangements for stability and for all the states and peoples of the region to 
settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's carefully worded message closely parallels a proposal made one week ago 
at the General Assembly by French President Francois Mitterrand and comes one 
day after Iraq's President Saddam Hussein commented favorably on Mitterrand's 
speech, praising its "positive tone." 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the statements by Bush, Mitterrand and Hussein could provide 
the outline for a possible peaceful end to the gulf crisis -- a settlement in 
which Hussein pulls his troops out of Kuwait but is able to tell his people 
that his invasion accomplished the goal of bringing about an international 
Mideast peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
But optimism over a peaceful settlement in the gulf remains faint. Although 
Bush's new language could provide an opening for diplomatic moves, the gap 
between Iraq and its opponents remains wide. Bush, briefly answering questions 
from reporters a few hours after his speech, emphasized that "Iraq's 
unconditional departure from Kuwait" must come before any other development. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no flexibility" on that demand, Bush said. Mitterrand had made a 
similar point in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hussein once again Sunday ruled out an Iraqi withdrawal from what 
he claims as Iraq's 19th province. 
</P>
<P>
And while the statements by Bush and Mitterrand could open the way to a 
diplomatic solution of the gulf crisis, their words could also serve a war 
policy, Western officials noted. The proposals could help peel away Hussein's 
Arab support and solidify international backing for the use of force against 
Iraq by portraying Hussein as a man blocking a chance for a wider Middle East 
settlement, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior French diplomat made that point last week after Mitterrand offered his 
peace proposal, saying the French president doubted that Hussein would accept 
his terms but expected his plan would either give Hussein a diplomatic fig leaf 
to cover a pullout from Kuwait or would clear the way for military action to 
dislodge his troops. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in his speech, called Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a "throwback to another 
era, a dark relic from a dark time." 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq and its leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and 
destruction," he said, a statement that could cover both a war crimes trial, 
which U.S. officials have made some preparations for, and Iraqi reparations 
payments to Kuwait, which the Arab League has demanded. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes in the conflict are high, Bush said, charging that Iraq's 
"aggression in the gulf is a menace not only to one region's security, but to 
the entire world's vision of our future." 
</P>
<P>
And he insisted that his talks with diplomats and world leaders here showed no 
holes in the anti-Iraq front. That support was on display in the General 
Assembly Hall as diplomats -- except for the Iraqi delegation -- gave Bush 
sustained applause when he declared that Iraq's "annexation of Kuwait will not 
be permitted to stand." 
</P>
<P>
By suggesting that the long-festering Arab-Israeli conflict could be settled 
once Iraq ended its occupation of Kuwait, Bush seemed to link the two issues in 
a way that he had previously not done. 
</P>
<P>
Any linkage is loose. Bush did not suggest -- as Hussein has done -- that all 
Middle East conflicts must be settled at once. But he did join Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and some Western European leaders in calling for a renewed 
effort to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict in the wake of the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's explicit mention of the Arab-Israeli conflict did not represent a change 
in U.S. policy, but it was a shift "of emphasis," as the President put it in 
his press conference. White House officials confirmed that the statement could 
be a signal in what one official called "a flurry" of diplomatic initiatives 
over the last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government opposes any linkage that would increase the 
international pressure on Israel to end its 23-year occupation of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has always strongly rejected any explicit "linkage" of those issues for 
several reasons. While Bush would like to provide some excuse that would allow 
Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, he also wants to ensure that Iraq does not end 
up appearing to have profited from aggression -- two goals that are obviously 
in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the disputes between Israel and the Arabs have resisted resolution 
for decades. Even in the current atmosphere of unprecedented superpower 
cooperation and new relations between old enemies, any Arab-Israeli negotiation 
would certainly be a long and difficult process. If such a process is to start, 
Bush wants to make sure that Iraq withdraws from Kuwait first and not at the 
conclusion of any negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But both Bush and Hussein are in a struggle to gain the support of Arab peoples 
and governments in the gulf conflict. Hussein has gained at least some leverage 
by positioning himself as the champion of the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Many Arab leaders have supported the idea of an international conference on the 
Middle East, believing that such a meeting would pressure Israel to withdraw 
from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Many Israeli leaders believe the 
same thing and have therefore opposed a conference. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's speech was also notable for its enthusiastic embrace of the United 
Nations, an institution that only a few years ago U.S. officials treated with 
disdain. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. is now fulfilling its promise as the world's parliament of peace," he 
said. "Let it be said of the final decade of the 20th Century: This was a time 
when humankind came into its own, when we emerged from the grit and the smoke 
of the industrial age to bring about a revolution of the spirit and the mind 
and began a journey into a new day, a new age and a new partnership of nations. 
</P>
<P>
"At last -- at long last -- we can build new bridges and tear down old walls," 
said Bush, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, Bush said, is "fully committed to supporting the United 
Nations and to paying what we are obliged to pay by our commitment to the 
charter." The United States began withholding part of its U.N. dues under the 
Reagan Administration in protest of U.N. policies. The withholding has 
continued, in part because members of Congress object to U.N. payments that 
take away money that could be used for domestic programs in this era of tight 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also reiterated his call for an international ban on chemical weapons and 
proposed creation of a U.N. office to assist developing democracies in holding 
free elections.

HUSSEIN FREES 9 HOSTAGES IN BID TO COURT FRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein freed nine French hostages Monday in a move widely 
interpreted as another step in his search for a soft spot in the international 
stranglehold on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage announcement came less than 24 hours after Hussein announced plans 
to contact the government of French President Francois Mitterrand in an effort 
to negotiate an end to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, France promptly rejected Hussein's peace feeler, which was 
accompanied by word that he intends to stand fast in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded 
on Aug. 2 and has since annexed. 
</P>
<P>
None of the nine Frenchmen freed Monday were among about 90 French citizens 
held hostage at strategic locations as part of Iraq's so-called human shield 
against attack. And none was either ill or infirm. All nine had been included 
in a list delivered to Iraqi leaders last week by the Franco-Iraqi Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"They are people who have problems with their family, with their relatives or 
with their work," said Gilles Muneir, the association's general secretary, who 
arrived in Baghdad 10 days ago hoping to arrange the French hostages' freedom. 
About 350 French nationals are believed to still be in Kuwait and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Muneir said he was not surprised by Hussein's announcement, which marks the 
first time the Iraqi president has released any of his Western and Japanese 
adult male hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed, which is a traditional occasion 
for such things," Muneir said. "But I was surprised by the number. I thought 
they would release only four. Jesse Jackson (the American political leader) 
asked for many to be released, and he got only 12." 
</P>
<P>
Muneir said Hussein made the gesture "to show that, on the Iraqi side, they 
want to have a dialogue with France." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the gesture was important in a larger, political context, Muneir 
replied: "It is important for the nine people, to begin with. It's a sign of 
good will, but it's also a response to Mitterrand's proposal in the United 
Nations." In a speech last week to the U.N. General Assembly, Mitterrand said 
that if Iraq frees all foreign hostages and agrees to withdraw from Kuwait, 
then "everything becomes possible" through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Western and Asian diplomats in Baghdad described the release of the French 
hostages as a transparent attempt by Hussein to court France, which -- as Iraqi 
officials have said privately -- Hussein views as one of the weaker links in 
the international force blockading his country. 
</P>
<P>
In the Western diplomatic corps, there was widespread agreement that the 
gesture will yield little. 
</P>
<P>
"These are only small gestures that won't amount to much," said a senior 
Western diplomat who represents a country with many civilians being held here 
against their will. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis don't want to accept that they are up against a formidable, 
collective international agreement. They don't appreciate the gravity of the 
situation or how annoyed people are getting with them." 
</P>
<P>
At last official count, the Iraqis were holding 93 Americans at strategic 
sites, in addition to nearly 1,000 other American men who are not permitted to 
leave Iraq and Kuwait. At least 220 Britons have also been detained, along with 
more than 100 Japanese and 77 Germans. 
</P>
<P>
In recent episodes of the brief nightly television feature called "Guest News," 
some of the detained hostages say they are eating well, living in adequate 
quarters and keeping generally fit. Nonetheless, many are reportedly being put 
to work by the Iraqis at the sites where they are held under military guard. 
</P>
<P>
In one such interview Saturday night, a Briton in a T-shirt and spectacles 
identified as Glenn Winwood looked into the camera and said: "We get plenty of 
food. The accommodations are good. Our 'hosts' have been pretty good. We play 
volleyball against them -- and beat 'em." 
</P>
<P>
However lighthearted, such sentiments are looked on here as an indicator of 
what an Asian diplomat called an almost universal susceptibility on the hostage 
issue among the nations directly involved in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Hussein's gesture to the French, this diplomat said: "He's looking 
for soft spots anywhere, and there are many. He knows that (in these 
circumstances) governments fall and reputations go up and down." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, he said, the Third World nations struggling to bring home their 
thousands of stranded, impoverished contract workers are questioning the West's 
motives in assembling a military force in the gulf. Many influential analysts 
in Asia, he said, believe that Hussein has been getting the best of it in the 
war of words. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cold-blooded, ruthless game," he said, "but that's the way (Hussein) is 
playing it. And he's playing it very well. He is saying, 'I am willing to talk 
to anyone unconditionally,' and we have a feeling that the West is playing into 
his hands. For the past two months, it's been all reaction, no initiative." 
</P>
<P>
It was a view echoed by Muneir, who plans to escort the nine freed hostages 
back to France today and start a campaign to get the French to pull out of the 
naval force deployed in the gulf, based in part on Hussein's "humanitarian" 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
When reminded that Hussein still holds hundreds of foreigners at places that 
may be bombed or shelled and that thousands of others are prevented from 
leaving Iraq, Muneir replied: 
</P>
<P>
"There is hope. The Iraqis have a lot of friends in the world. If every friend 
comes here and takes one of their countrymen out, they will all be gone very 
soon."

LAWYER FOR ACLU LOSES IN RIGHTS CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand a precedent-setting damage award 
against a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer charged with violating 
the rights of a Newport Beach policeman by ejecting him from a public meeting 
on police surveillance practices. 
</P>
<P>
The court, ruling without comment, rejected arguments that ACLU lawyer Rees 
Lloyd of Los Angeles did not violate Officer Richard Long's rights when he 
ordered him to leave a 1980 ACLU meeting that was open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The case marked the first time that the ACLU, for decades a champion of 
individual rights, or one of its lawyers has been held liable for infringing on 
the rights of others. The ACLU has already paid Long $35,000 as a settlement. 
Lloyd, who was also named as a defendant in the suit, was assessed $10,000 in 
damages and $36,000 for Long's legal fees. It was not known if the ACLU will 
pay any of the money assessed against Lloyd, who is now in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
For Long, now a sergeant who supervises the Newport Beach police 
robbery-homicide squad, the end of the 10-year-old case came as a pleasant 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to have it behind me. For me, this lawsuit was a matter of 
principle," said Long, who said he took personal exception to his ouster from 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a problem with registering at the meeting as a police officer, 
or having a policeman attending an ACLU meeting," Long said. "But to eject you 
out of the meeting and make a spectacle for the purpose of embarrassing you as 
an individual, or embarrassing a police department, was just inappropriate, and 
it didn't reflect favorably on their support of individual rights." 
</P>
<P>
Long, who had registered as a police officer at the conference in Newport 
Beach, was secretly tape-recording the meeting and taking notes on what was 
said, according to court documents. He contended that as a community relations 
officer, he had a right to attend and learn the ACLU's opinion of his 
department's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's attorneys had challenged a California Supreme Court decision last April 
that let stand a lower court's ruling that Long's removal from the conference 
was discriminatory under the Unruh Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU lawyers had vigorously defended the officer's ejection, saying the right 
of free association allowed conference organizers to turn away someone they 
believed was an undercover "government agent." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh R. Manes, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented Lloyd, said the lower court 
decision would have set a "dangerous precedent" by lowering the safeguards for 
freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
"It says basically that you can't throw a police officer out of a meeting who 
is spying on you," Manes said. "This is a freedom of speech issue and freedom 
of association (issue), and the right to protest."

STATE COULD LOSE FEDERAL HEALTH FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
NURSING HOMES: UP TO $1 BILLION COULD BE WITHHELD BECAUSE OF REFUSAL TO PROVIDE 
MONEY REQUIRED UNDER NEW U.S. RULES, OFFICIAL SAYS.

<P>
California is in danger of losing $1 billion in federal funds for the care of 
70,000 nursing home residents because the state refuses to provide additional 
money to improve care under new federal rules, a top U.S. official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
California nursing home residents "are entitled to the same protection as 
people in all the other states," said Gail Wilensky, head of the Health Care 
Financing Administration. State officials "told us they don't have the money 
but we are not about to set up a different set of rules for California," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Angry state officials insist that California has an effective system of 
regulation assuring top-quality care in nursing homes and contend that the new 
rules, which took effect Monday, are simply administrative details. 
</P>
<P>
The state and federal governments each pays half the cost of nursing home care 
for indigent patients. The improvements for which the state has refused to pay 
include having a nurse available 24 hours a day and offering dental care, 
Wilensky said. 
</P>
<P>
Individual nursing homes whose contracts with the federal government expire as 
early as December will be ineligible for federal funding if they do not comply 
with the new federal rules, Wilensky said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the additional state funds, the nursing homes would be forced to dip 
into their own cash or raise sharply the fees charged to residents who pay for 
their own care. 
</P>
<P>
California could lose all Medicaid funding for nursing home patients in three 
or four months unless the state agrees to spend the money needed for better 
care, she warned. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government never has cut off a state's funding. Before any final 
federal action to cut funds, it is likely that nursing home residents or 
operators will sue the state to force compliance with the law, Wilensky said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Washington and Sacramento are on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to adopt the new federal paper work -- it would cost $400 
million to $600 million and add nothing to the quality of patient care," said 
John Rodriguez, deputy director of medical care services at the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
California has more extensive training for nurse aides than is required under 
the new federal law and requires 24-hour nursing service except on weekends, 
said Teresa Hawkes, deputy director for licensing. 
</P>
<P>
The state Legislature in August added $100 million in funds for patient care, 
saying that would be sufficient to put California into compliance with the law. 
The state refuses to take any further action. 
</P>
<P>
From the federal viewpoint, this is an unacceptable act of defiance. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, the state pulled its survey teams out of training programs 
run by the federal government to explain the new rules, saying that the 
training was unnecessary because California already was obeying the law. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the refusal to cooperate, Wilensky said, Washington will withhold $5 
million in funds that would have been used to help pay for surveys at each 
nursing home to assure acceptance of the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very distressing and a very serious matter," Wilensky said. "We do not 
like being on a collision course." 
</P>
<P>
California spends $2 billion a year on nursing home care under the Medi-Cal 
program, which helps pay the medical bills for the poor, and is reimbursed half 
that amount by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The state has an $8-billion Medi-Cal budget and spending jumped $900 million 
this year as the state expanded emergency care services to illegal aliens, 
increased payments to hard-pressed hospitals, and increased the number of 
eligible poor women and children. In August, the Legislature said that rising 
overall costs prevented greater funding for nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing better than the federal government (in setting nursing home 
standards) for 12 years, and we're not getting any credit for it," said Hawkes. 
"We pay on a 50-50 basis and we expect to be equal partners." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Keegan, a spokeswoman for the American Health Care Assn., an industry 
trade group, said nursing homes are "caught in the middle." If federal funds 
are cut off, "ultimately the residents are the ones who are hurt."

RIVALS ADVOCATE SIMILAR ENERGY POLICIES

<P>
Using the tense standoff in the Middle East as a backdrop, Dianne Feinstein and 
Pete Wilson pressed Monday for a stiffer state resolve in conserving energy and 
enforcing the use of alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
In statements to the Legislature's Joint Committee on Energy Regulation and the 
Environment, the candidates signaled that whoever wins their race for governor 
will push for federal legislation to allow California to set higher 
fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks than those currently set by the 
U.S. government. Both candidates also said they would support the use of tax 
incentives to encourage homeowners to install energy-efficient devices in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said she would seek to order oil companies to set up a separate "West 
Coast petroleum reserve" to cover the needs of Californians should another gas 
shortage hit. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve, she said, would ensure that in an emergency, "Californians are not 
waiting in endless gas lines to share rationed fuels." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the market. We've got the consumers. We've got 30 million people," 
she said. "This market must speak out and say what its demands are." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein spoke directly to the committee, meeting at the State Building in 
downtown Los Angeles, and Wilson prepared a speech that was read to the 
assembled legislators. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to espousing similar goals in some policy areas, the two 
gubernatorial candidates took a similar tack in criticizing energy-conservation 
efforts undertaken by the current governor, Republican George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein took on Deukmejian directly, accusing him of turning a blind eye to 
price hikes in the wake of Middle East turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
"The current Administration's blind faith in market forces has kept it from 
taking action in the face of profiteering," said Feinstein, vowing to "rapidly 
investigate" oil company actions if she becomes governor. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also reaffirmed her opposition to offshore oil drilling. Proponents 
of drilling off the California shoreline, including Deukmejian, have cited the 
Middle East crisis as a rationale for exploring future drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"Drilling off the coast of California will not solve our energy problems, nor 
will it protect our environment," she said. "All the oil we could recover off 
our coast, at a tremendous risk of environmental catastrophe, would only amount 
to a few weeks' supply." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, though he did not mention it in his prepared remarks, also has 
continued to oppose offshore drilling in the two months since the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait disrupted world oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican senator, who disagrees with Deukmejian on a number of policy 
fronts, also indirectly criticized the governor by saying that there had been 
"little accountability" in the state's effort to cut its own energy usage. 
Wilson said he would "require" enforcement of energy-saving goals and vowed 
revenge on the budgets of the state departments that do not cut back. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates cited the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as evidence of the 
tenuousness of America's hold on oil supplies. And they looked to the 
automobile as providing the greatest opportunity for changing California's 
oil-splurging habits. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein told the legislators that she would require that all new state-owned 
cars be powered by alternative fuels by 1998, with the entire fleet converted 
by the year 2000. Wilson's timetable was even shorter -- the senator pledged 
that the conversion would be completed by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Feinstein took differing approaches to the dilemma of enforcing 
energy efficiency on homes, many of which were built well before energy 
conservation came into vogue. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor said she would require that homes be retrofitted 
with devices such as low-flow shower heads and water heater insulation before 
they are sold. She estimated the cost to homeowners would be $300 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in contrast, said he would encourage banks and savings and loans to 
offer breaks to residents buying energy-efficient homes, and said he favored 
grants to enable low-income residents to boost the efficiency of their homes.

ON CALIFORNIA: TRYING TO BUILD FROM THE RUINS IN SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

LOS ANGELESROBERT A. JONES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a famous photograph from Sacramento, 1949. It shows a man named Artie 
Samish perched on a chair at the old Senator Hotel. A straw boater tilts 
backward on his head, and he is gesturing grandly to a small figure on his lap. 
The figure is a ventriloquist's dummy. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Samish was the most powerful lobbyist in Sacramento, a man who 
ordered special favors for his clients like a pasha orders lunch. The dummy, of 
course, was the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the days when legislators were underpaid, understaffed and 
altogether ill fed. Suckers, we are told, for the big bankrolls of Samish and 
his like. 
</P>
<P>
"Drop a $2 bill in the Capitol rotunda," Samish once said, "and you'll start a 
riot." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Samish was hauled off to prison for his sins, and California 
appeared to have learned its lesson. A reform movement began here that 
eventually spread across the nation. The Legislature was converted to a 
professional operation where lawmakers were paid a living wage, where they had 
the staff and the general wherewithal to handle affairs of state. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Election Day arrives, you will likely hear much of Artie Samish. 
That's because our leaders in Sacramento are frightened that we are about to 
abandon the philosophy and reforms that grew out of the Samish era. They are 
going to wave the specter of Artie Samish as a warning of what might return. 
</P>
<P>
We are talking here about two propositions, 131 and 140, that have received 
only scant attention thus far. That is odd because either of them, if passed, 
would revolutionize Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Both initiatives would limit the terms of legislators and statewide officers to 
periods ranging from six to 12 years. That is, they would preclude anyone from 
approaching lawmaking as a profession. Generally, 140 would do a much harsher 
job of it than 131 and would cut back the staffs of legislators to boot. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, they have their roots in opposite philosophical camps. 
Proposition 131 is the child of John K. Van de Kamp's failed campaign for 
governor, and we can only suppose it was meant to incite the passions of his 
liberal constituency. Meanwhile, 140 is the revenge weapon of Pistol Pete 
Schabarum, the Los Angeles County supervisor who has yet to encounter a 
government he likes. 
</P>
<P>
Should these propositions pass, state government as we know it would cease to 
exist. Not only would they force the eventual retirement of the likes of Willie 
Brown and David Roberti, they would retire the whole notion of a Willie Brown 
or a David Roberti. No one becomes a Willie Brown in two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Is that bad? If you're a Sacramento politician, maybe you shouldn't ask. I 
suspect that one of the strongest emotions driving 131 and 140 toward victory 
is the fervently held desire of millions to see Willie get his. If the anti-131 
and anti-140 people are shrewd, they will keep Willie out of this campaign and 
off the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Almost certainly, what the "antis" will do is forward the Artie Samish 
argument. It goes like this: If you force legislators to become amateurs, you 
play into the hands of the professional lobbyists. The insurance company types 
and oil company types will run circles around our know-nothing rookies. And 
ruin will result. 
</P>
<P>
A permutation of this argument says 131 and 140 will work to transfer power to 
the bureaucrats. Because the bureaucrats are permanent and know all the levers 
of government, etc., etc., it is they who will become the true government of 
the state. And ruin will result. 
</P>
<P>
These arguments have a fatal weakness: Sacramento is regarded as being in ruins 
already. Just witness the fall ballot; those 28 propositions represent our 
pathetic attempt to do the Legislature's work for it. 
</P>
<P>
And the truth is, no one knows exactly how 131 and 140 would change Sacramento. 
The allusions to the Artie Samish era are false because the 1990s are not the 
1940s. Who can say what kind of men and women would be attracted to the idea of 
spending eight years, and eight years only, in the Legislature? Toadies? Hicks? 
Or some smart cookies who simply don't want to spend their entire lives in a 
hearing room? 
</P>
<P>
It may be worth a shot. Oklahoma passed a similar plan earlier this fall, and 
the early polls show both propositions are heavily favored here. 
</P>
<P>
As campaigns begin, the "antis" should keep something in mind: These 
initiatives have something of the flavor of Proposition 13. That is, their 
support springs from a deep anger and a willingness to take a gamble. This 
revolution will not be easily defeated.

IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA DISCUSS RESUMING TIES

<P>
The foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia met in New York to discuss 
resuming diplomatic ties after a 2 1/2-year rift, Iran said Monday. The move 
could further isolate Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the 
meeting between Iran's Ali Akbar Velayati and Saudi Arabia's Prince Saud al 
Faisal took place Sunday at United Nations headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that senior officials from the two Muslim nations have 
met since the Saudis broke off ties April 26, 1988, accusing Iran of terrorism 
and subversion. Saudi Arabia was one of Iraq's main backers in the Iran-Iraq 
War. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting apparently did not go much beyond both sides spelling out their 
positions. But it was the most positive sign yet that the two countries may be 
moving toward a rapprochement amid the political upheaval triggered by Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting apparently came out of a mediation effort by Syrian President Hafez 
Assad, Iran's key Arab ally and longtime rival of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Assad, who is now also allied with the United States and Saudi Arabia against 
Iraq, visited Tehran for the first time last month. He apparently encouraged 
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to speed up efforts to end the feud with 
Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
IRNA gave no timetable for a rapprochement. But it quoted Saud as saying that 
his country is eager to resolve the issue of how many pilgrims Iran can send to 
Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine, before the next pilgrimage season, which starts 
next June. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, more than 400 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims, were killed in 
what the Saudis said were Iranian-inspired riots in Mecca, birthplace of the 
Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, the Saudis announced a quota system that would have cut the 
Iranian contingent from 150,000 to about 55,000. Iran has boycotted the annual 
pilgrimage since then. 
</P>
<P>
Veering toward a tougher line against Iraq, Rafsanjani, in a speech to 
delegates to a Tehran trade fair, Monday assailed the invasion of Kuwait as a 
"malevolent measure." 
</P>
<P>
His censure of the Baghdad regime marked the latest turn of the Iranian 
government, which has steadfastly opposed the invasion but has sent signals 
that the presence of Western forces in the Persian Gulf is also a threat.

PARIS SPURNS PEACEMAKER ROLE IN GULF; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: FRENCH OFFICIALS DENY THEY NEGOTIATED WITH BAGHDAD TO WIN THE 
RELEASE OF 9 HOSTAGES.

Normally delighted to play a starring role in world affairs, French leaders 
said Monday that they have been miscast as peacemakers by Iraq's President 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein said Sunday in a speech in Baghdad that he planned to contact France 
for talks seeking to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis, and on Monday he ordered 
the release of nine French hostages held as involuntary "guests" in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
French officials, clearly embarrassed, denied Monday that France has entered 
into negotiations with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
There has been "only routine contact," Hubert Vedrine, a spokesman for French 
President Francois Mitterrand, told reporters, "nothing in any case that can be 
interpreted as a negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
Hadelin de Latour du Pin, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, insisted that 
France is not a "weak point" in the international alliance against Iraq and 
will not be influenced by what he described as an attempt to divide the Western 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is clear that Iraq is playing that game," he said. "I think we can 
understand why, but up to now it has not been crowned with success." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Mitterrand has taken a public stand that Iraq must withdraw 
its troops from Kuwait, and he cited Mitterrand's decision to send planes and 
4,300 military personnel to the gulf region as a sign of France's commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Vedrine confirmed that Mitterrand is planning to go to the region to meet with 
French military commanders and regional leaders. For security reasons, no date 
has been announced, but according to the French press, the trip will take place 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the release of the French hostages, Vedrine said: "Nine hostages have 
been freed, but that does not change at all the basic problem. The question is 
the liberation of all French and foreign hostages." 
</P>
<P>
According to official French estimates, the Iraqis are holding a total of 352 
French nationals, 267 in Iraq and 85 in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
French officials said the Iraqis apparently misunderstood or misinterpreted 
Mitterrand's Sept. 24 speech to the U.N. General Assembly. Mitterrand condemned 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the taking of hostages, but he added that after 
Iraq "states its intention to withdraw its troops and liberates the hostages, 
then everything becomes possible." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ambassador to France, Abdul Razzak Hashimi, promptly hailed the speech 
as a "positive step that suggests an open door." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, French officials explained that Mitterrand had meant that Iraq needs 
to do more than simply declare its intention to withdraw troops and release 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"One must be very precise," Vedrine said. "There has been a misunderstanding. . 
. . The word intention is very important, but it does not lead to negotiations. 
It leads on to the second phase, in which the U.N. Security Council supervises 
the evacuation of military forces and restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty."

MILITARY: OFFICIALS FEAR SUCH WEAPONS COULD SHATTER THE FRAGILE COALITION 
ARRAYED AGAINST SADDAM HUSSEIN.

The United States has placed no nuclear weapons in Saudi Arabia or surrounding 
countries and has no plans to use them even in response to an Iraqi attack 
using chemical or biological weapons, U.S. military officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After considerable debate among the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a decision was made 
early in the crisis not to deploy tactical nuclear weapons with Army, Air Force 
or Marine Corps units sent to the area, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Navy ships in the region are equipped with nuclear bombs and cruise 
missiles, but Navy ships customarily sail with nuclear weapons, and their 
presence is not meant as a threat to use them, according to military 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that they have kept nuclear weapons out of the 
region not only for moral reasons, but also because a threat to use them could 
shatter the fragile coalition of nations now arrayed against Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, military commanders said, they are not needed to counter the threat 
posed by Iraq's army. 
</P>
<P>
"You lose the moral high ground if you use one of those stupid things," a 
senior Army planner privy to discussions of the Joint Chiefs said. "Plus, you 
don't have to. The conventional weapons we have there are absolutely, 
absolutely devastating and will have many of the same effects" as tactical 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
He cited in particular cluster bombs, which can wipe out large troop 
concentrations over an extensive area and new generations of conventional high 
explosives with many times the destructive power of earlier munitions. 
</P>
<P>
And if a decision is ever made to employ nuclear weapons, they are readily 
available in abundance in Europe or could be dropped from B-52s based in Diego 
Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The unusually frank U.S. government comments on nuclear weapons come in the 
wake of a weekend press report from Britain -- since denied by Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher -- that Britain is prepared to use nuclear arms in response 
to an Iraqi chemical attack. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is known to have one of the world's largest arsenals of chemical weapons 
and no compunctions about using them. Hussein has threatened to fire poison gas 
at U.S. and allied troops if war breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence agencies also recently have reported that by the beginning of 
next year, Iraq will be able to produce and deliver substantial amounts of 
biological weapons, which involve living organisms used to spread diseases such 
as cholera, anthrax or typhoid fever. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials said there remains a huge gulf between these weapons of mass 
destruction and nuclear arms, which were not used in Korea and Vietnam even 
when the United States was on the verge of losing those conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Public U.S. policy statements since the end of World War II always have left 
the use or threat to use nuclear weapons ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
The United States insists that its nuclear weapons in Europe are there solely 
to deter their use by the Soviet Union and its allies, yet the United States 
has never forsworn their first use. 
</P>
<P>
American military doctrine since the early 1960s has been one of "flexible 
response" -- a continuum of escalation from the use of conventional military 
force to the unleashing of intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear 
warheads in an all-out superpower war. 
</P>
<P>
But in practical terms, nuclear weapons are taboo, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The matter has been fairly heavily debated and discussed . . . among the 
Chiefs, and that's the decision they came up with," a knowledgeable civilian 
Pentagon official said of the policy of not sending tactical nuclear weapons to 
the Persian Gulf. "If we were to rattle the nuclear saber now, it wouldn't bode 
well for the coalition." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Army officer noted that the use of nuclear weapons would expose as 
hypocritical previous U.S. efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear 
technology, with potentially catastrophic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"If you popped a nuke, you'd lose the moral imperative overnight. The nuclear 
genie is still very much in the bottle. If you use one, every nation on Earth 
would want to have them and use them," this officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have extraordinary and long-lasting consequences. It just points up 
the fact that nuclear weapons are fundamentally unusable," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials and outside analysts cited two other fundamental 
reasons why nuclear weapons have not been moved to Saudi Arabia: the elaborate 
security precautions required to protect them from being seized by terrorists 
or overrun in battle and the diplomatic repercussions of putting such weapons 
in a sovereign country without extensive consultations. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd need 20,000 men just to guard them," one senior military officer at the 
Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
Artillery-launched nuclear shells would have to be deployed with forward units, 
running a high risk of their being captured in battle. The Air Force would have 
to build or find secure shelters to store air-dropped atomic bombs and missiles 
-- an expensive and manpower-intensive proposition, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic considerations also played in the decision not to send nuclear 
weapons to the Middle East, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The civilian planner noted that the Saudis invited the international force to 
deter an Iraqi attack, not to rain nuclear weapons on a fellow Arab state. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither us nor the Brits could introduce them without Saudi approval" -- and 
that hasn't been granted, this official said. 
</P>
<P>
But several officials and analysts noted that Hussein should not assume the 
United States could not or would not use nuclear weapons if the military 
situation grew sufficiently dire. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of nukes is preposterous, and they have not been deployed in theater," 
a Pentagon official said. "But we could get them there in a hurry if the 
President decided we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bruce G. Blair, a nuclear weapons specialist at the Brookings 
Institution: "There's enough ambiguity in our deployments of nuclear weapons at 
sea and our ability to deliver nuclear weapons by air and quickly move them 
into the region to plant the seeds of doubt in Hussein's mind."

A Chinese airliner carrying 90 people crashed into another plane, causing 
numerous casualties, as it landed at Canton airport today, according to reports 
from the southern China city. 
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the Boeing 737, which apparently took off from the Fujian 
province city of Xiamen, had been hijacked before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Government-run Hong Kong radio said there were unconfirmed reports of an 
explosion shortly before the landing. 
</P>
<P>
"What we heard is that most of them died," a Canton hospital official told Hong 
Kong's TVB television station. "Only a few survived. We received two who died." 
</P>
<P>
Another hospital official told the television station: "The aircraft was full, 
and the others were full too. You can imagine how many died." 
</P>
<P>
The television station said it had contacted six Canton-area hospitals and was 
told that there were at least nine survivors. 
</P>
<P>
An official of one Canton hospital contacted from Hong Kong by the British news 
agency Reuters said his institution had received five casualties. One, a man in 
his 70s believed to be from Taiwan, died. 
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 737 can carry about 130 people, but the Canton People's Broadcasting 
station reported that the plane, owned by China's state airline CAAC, was 
carrying 90 people. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation officials in Hong Kong and Canton said the airplane apparently had 
been hijacked. 
</P>
<P>
Various reports from Canton said the plane hit one or two other Chinese planes 
after touchdown. An airport official in Canton told Reuters that a Boeing 757 
on the tarmac was badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the U.S. Consulate in Canton said there were no immediate 
reports of any American casualties.

GUNMEN KILL 25, WOUND 82 AT LEBANESE RALLY

Twenty-five people were killed and 82 wounded Monday when gunmen opened fire on 
a candlelight rally of hundreds of followers of Christian Maj. Gen. Michel 
Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said the attack came at the Nahr el Mawt (Death River) 
crossing point linking Aoun's territory to areas controlled by the rival 
Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, men, women and children holding Lebanese flags and candles, 
were protesting President Elias Hrawi's blockade of areas of Christian East 
Beirut held by Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
"Bodies are still lying on the street with the Red Cross unable to reach them 
because of continued shooting," one Christian security source said. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun accused the Lebanese Front and Hrawi's troops, who guard a checkpoint at 
the crossing, of opening fire at the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the ugliest crime. . . . It is a crime committed in cooperation and 
coordination between Hrawi's government and the Lebanese Forces militia," Aoun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun does not recognize Hrawi's authority and rejects reforms aimed at giving 
Muslims a greater role in Lebanon's Christian-dominated political system. 
</P>
<P>
Hrawi's army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, issued a statement denying that his 
troops fired on the rally, adding he has ordered an investigation into the 
"regretful" incident. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Forces radio accused Aoun's soldiers of shooting at the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's television station showed footage of panic-stricken demonstrators 
running for shelter and badly wounded people screaming in pain. 
</P>
<P>
Wounded protesters said Lebanese Forces gunmen holding positions just yards 
from the rally were responsible for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I was leading the march. . . . When we reached 25 yards from the forces' 
position they opened fire on us," one wounded man said. "It was a massacre." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's night protest followed Aoun's call Sunday for Lebanese to beat the 
blockade imposed on his stronghold in a bid to starve him into surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, 54, was appointed head of an interim government when Lebanon was left 
without a president in 1988. He has refused to quit despite Hrawi's election 
last year.

SOVIET UNION: THE POPULAR FRONT WINS ONLY ABOUT 25 OF 350 CONTESTS, ACCORDING 
TO INCOMPLETE RETURNS.

The Azerbaijani Popular Front, which appeared to dominate the political scene 
in the southern Soviet republic earlier this year, bringing masses into the 
streets, won few races in local weekend elections, leaders of the organization 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although similar nationalist movements have swept elections in several other 
republics earlier this year, the Popular Front won only about 25 of 350 
contests, according to unofficial and still incomplete results. 
</P>
<P>
The elections, which drew 81% of registered voters to the polls, were the first 
since the mass unrest January in Baku, the capital, and were regarded as a 
major test of strength for competing political forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Popular Front denounced the election as invalid, alleging there were 
widespread violation of election procedures, including multiple voting. Sabit 
Bagirov, one of the front's leaders, said the election results should not be 
interpreted to mean the Azerbaijanis prefer rule by the Communist Party to rule 
by nationalist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot evaluate the strength of the Popular Front from the election 
results because there were so many violations of election rules," Bagirov 
asserted. "Polls of people on the streets show that 60% support the Popular 
Front and only 6% support the Communist Party." 
</P>
<P>
Bagirov said that the front had anticipated its defeat because of the large 
troop presence in the republic under the continuing state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"If the election was held in March or April, the Popular Front would have won," 
Bagirov said. At the time, it still enjoyed great popular appeal because of the 
rapid democratic developments in the republic late last year. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 Popular Front candidates will be in runoff elections Oct. 15, 
according to Bagirov, who will be one of them. Many races are expected to go 
into this second round since an average of three candidates were competing for 
each seat and winners must receive at least 50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the election observers, numbering more than 300 from other Soviet 
republics, were either thrown out of polling stations by members of the 
election commission or prevented from coming into Azerbaijan by an order of the 
military commander in Baku, Bagirov said. 
</P>
<P>
Sevinch Abdullaeva, a spokesperson for the official Azerbaijani information 
agency Azerinform, said the Popular Front's accusations are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
"There were violations," she said, "but not of the kind that could invalidate 
the elections." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the reported violations involved people trying to vote where they were 
not registered in order to vote for favorite candidates, Abdullaeva said. In 
one voting district, the results were annulled when the election commission 
failed to follow procedures, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Popular Front candidates also complained they were not able to campaign 
properly because of the state of emergency in effect since January. Troops were 
sent to Baku after an estimated 60 Armenians there were killed in pogroms. In 
the subsequent fighting between troops and Baku residents, more than 150 
people, most of them Azerbaijanis, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Although troops were out of sight on election day, the stress caused by months 
of living in a state of emergency led the people to vote for Communist Party 
candidates, Bagirov said. 
</P>
<P>
Bagirov said the nationalists' political rallies were banned and they were not 
allowed to print their own newspaper due to the state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Abdullaeva of Azerinform said, however, that no official protests about 
interference in campaigns had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
"All the registered candidates were quite free to campaign," Abdullaeva said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, nationalist or democratic movements won majorities in the 
republican parliaments of Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia and 
Moldova (formerly Moldavia) for the first time in Soviet history. 
</P>
<P>
The movements are gaining strength in other areas of the country as well, 
challenging the authority of the central government on a range of issues, 
including environmental protection and economic autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
In Kazakhstan, in Soviet Central Asia, regional authorities on Monday banned 
nuclear testing in Semipalatinsk because of what they called danger to 
residents' health, the official Tass news agency reported. The top-secret range 
at Semipalatinsk has been the country's major nuclear testing area for 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of nuclear explosions, including air blasts, have taken place in 
Kazakhstan, subjecting more than 500,000 to the harmful effects of radiation," 
Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
In Kiev, capital of the Ukraine, tens of thousands of people from across the 
republic demonstrated for the second day, waving blue-and-yellow national flags 
and calling for greater independence from Moscow. The nationalist movement Rukh 
had called for a republic-wide strike, but only a few enterprises took part, 
Rukh spokesman Pavel Bakumenko said. 
</P>
<P>
A delegation from Lithuania, led by President Vytautas Landsbergis and Prime 
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Nikolai 
I. Ryzhkov in Moscow today to discuss future negotiations on the republic's 
independence. Lithuania declared its independence on March 11, but froze that 
declaration in late June, bowing to an economic blockade imposed by the 
Kremlin.

More than 18,000 Soviet Jews immigrated to Israel in September, bringing the 
total for the year to more than 100,000 for an all-time record, the National 
Conference on Soviet Jewry said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's immigration figure of 18,725 surpassed the previous record of 
17,484 in August. So far, the total for 1990 is 100,926. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is a coalition of 45 national Jewish organizations and more than 
300 local community councils and federations.

COMPROMISE IS SEEN AS '92 CURTAIN RAISER 
</P>

The compromise budget accord hammered out by the Republican White House and the 
Democrat-controlled Congress raises the curtain on the battle for the 
presidency in 1992 -- and foreshadows the major battle lines between and within 
the parties during the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is banking on the hope that the harsh economic nostrums of spending cuts 
and tax increases prescribed for 1990 will be all but forgotten two years hence 
when, if all goes well, the revitalized economy will be soaring. 
</P>
<P>
"The real goals are to get spending under control and economic growth going 
again," said Charles Black, chief spokesman for the Republican National 
Committee. "That means a healthy economy and history tells us that the state of 
the economy is the biggest issue in presidential elections." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, no one can guarantee that the remedies devised at the bipartisan 
budget summit will produce a rosy economic picture. But as congressional 
analyst Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute pointed out: "One 
thing the summit negotiators felt sure of, was that if they didn't do anything 
at all, the economy would be that much worse in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Democratic leaders backing the budget agreement see it as a 
chance to establish some voter confidence in their fiscal management abilities, 
an area where polls have long indicated their reputations to be sorely in need 
of repair. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a recent Times Mirror poll showed that when asked which party is 
best able to generate economic growth, 40% of those interviewed chose the 
Republicans, while only 29% favored the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"With this plan George Bush has given us an opportunity to take the high ground 
and show people that we put the national interest above the special interests," 
said Al From, executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group 
of centrist Democratic elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
By regaining the confidence of the public and restoring their own confidence in 
themselves, Democrats believe that they will be in a strong position to raise 
their favorite issues of economic justice against incumbent Bush in the 1992 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We think fairness is still our main issue," says Richard Moe, a former Jimmy 
Carter White House aide and now an adviser to House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
"And we believe that the whole debate over the budget has helped frame the 
issues we can use," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Democrats went through an important baptism of fire by using the 
'tax-breaks-for-the-rich issue' against Bush and forcing him to back off his 
campaign pledge to cut the capital gains tax," said political analyst Kevin 
Phillips, author of the bestseller "Politics of the Rich and Poor," which 
lambastes both parties for short-sighted economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats contend that baptism lends further credibility to the charge 
that they plan to use against Bush in the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
One big problem with carrying out these presidential campaign scenarios is that 
the intraparty disagreements on the budget are nearly as intense as the 
differences that pit the parties against each other. Thus, even if the package 
is adopted by Congress, it may be difficult for either party to muster the 
unity needed to exploit the potential political advantages it offers. 
</P>
<P>
In both parties, prominent activists and officeholders -- from House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to New York's Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- 
contend that the budget package is either bad politics or bad economics, or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
"This package will lose jobs, raise taxes and deepen the recession," Gingrich 
said. He and other conservative Republicans object mostly to the proposed tax 
increases in the package. 
</P>
<P>
"The gasoline and liquor tax increases are directed right at the ethnic urban 
voters who swing back and forth in elections," said David Keene, chairman of 
the American Conservative Union. He worries that these voters, who were 
attracted to Bush by his pledge not to raise taxes, might return to their 
traditional home in the Democratic Party as a result of Bush's shift on that 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo, who many now consider a favorite for his party's 1992 presidential 
nomination, will issue a statement today opposing the proposal, according to 
Brad Johnson, chief Washington lobbyist for New York state. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo objects, among other things, to the proposal to partly repeal 
deductibility of state and local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
So far as the 1990 congressional elections are concerned, most analysts think 
that the net impact when voters go to the polls in November will be minimal. 
Some challengers in both parties will try to get votes by exploiting resentment 
of the tax increases in the package. 
</P>
<P>
But incumbents who back the compromise will claim credit for avoiding the 
disruptions that automatic spending cuts would have brought.

U.S. ROLE IN MIDEAST HELPED TO PUT A LID ON DEFENSE CUTS, STRATEGISTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: OPERATION DESERT SHIELD ALTERED THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE 
NEGOTIATIONS, AIDES CONTEND. LAWMAKERS WHO HAD CALLED FOR DEEP CUTBACKS WERE 
FORCED ON THE DEFENSIVE.

The political backdrop of the U.S. military deployment in Saudi Arabia played a 
significant role in limiting defense cuts in Sunday's budget agreement, halting 
the military spending "free fall" that some analysts had predicted two months 
ago, budget aides said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Capitol Hill strategists said that Operation Desert Shield forged a major 
change in the political climate of the negotiations, forcing lawmakers who had 
been advocating deep cuts on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
While many Democrats were eager to cut more deeply, a Democratic strategist 
said: "It was just not something they wanted to campaign on a week later. The 
politics shifted in favor of those who wanted to cut less." 
</P>
<P>
The defense budget compromise struck by negotiators Sunday would leave not only 
funding for Operation Desert Shield intact but would spare much of the funding 
that has been spent each year to prepare for a major Soviet onslaught on 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
While as much as 60% of the annual defense budget in recent decades has gone 
toward preparations for a large-scale war in Europe, military spending would 
shrink by less than 20% by 1995 under the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in January proposed to trim defense spending by 
10% over the five years ending in fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting that target has forced the Pentagon to consider cutting two Navy 
aircraft carriers, scrapping its nuclear missile modernization plans and 
reducing the military's rolls of uniformed personnel -- about 2.1 million 
servicemen and women -- by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the accord forged by the White House and congressional leaders 
would cut the Pentagon budget almost 20% over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
But while many analysts had called for reductions of 25% and more -- and 
appeared likely to see their recommendations become policy -- the crisis in the 
Middle East has changed that, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychologically, (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein helped build a floor into 
the defense budget," said Gordon Adams, director of the Washington-based 
Defense Budget Project. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned the House of Representatives' number from a guess to an absolute 
bottom. Not because the money had anything to do with Desert Shield, but 
numbers in this town become symbols. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically, it became difficult for people to say, 'my symbol for my 
commitment to national defense is a very deep cut.' The impact was one of 
political psychology," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, normally an outspoken critic of such congressional deals, stayed silent 
on Monday about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official said that Cheney had been involved in drafting the 
accord and would be "actively working the phones" with lawmakers this week. 
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of saying that Cheney would lobby in support of the 
compromise, implying that the defense secretary has reservations about the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the political impact of the U.S. Middle East deployment, defense 
negotiators decided to separate funding for Operation Desert Shield from the 
budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
By doing so, lawmakers hope to avoid the appearance that their insistence on 
defense cuts has imposed any further hardship on U.S. troops in and around 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But the tactic achieved another purpose, welcomed by lawmakers intent on 
limiting Pentagon budgets. 
</P>
<P>
By separating $15-billion worth of Middle East operating costs from the 1990 
budget, the lawmakers denied the Pentagon the opportunity to "pad" the 1990 
budget, which will become the base line against which future growth or 
shrinkage in defense budgets would be compared. 
</P>
<P>
If the defense budget were $15-billion larger in its base year, then in each 
subsequent year, the Pentagon would have to ask for more money just to stay 
even with its last year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The larger base would also have made it easier for the Pentagon to claim to 
have made deeper cuts in subsequent years because of the inflated budget of the 
base year. 
</P>
<P>
That move, Adams said, will prevent the Pentagon from using Operation Desert 
Shield to inflate future defense budgets and "throw every weapon under Saddam 
Hussein's Christmas tree."

<P>
In a poignant moment before plunging into a busy fall term Monday, the Supreme 
Court bade a fond farewell to Justice William J. Brennan Jr., with the 
conservative chief justice hailing the retiring liberal's "profound influence 
on American constitutional law." 
</P>
<P>
The court, which soon will turn its attention to a calendar that includes new 
challenges to federal anti-discrimination laws and to the scope of the 1st 
Amendment, paused on the first day of its new term to observe the passing of an 
era. 
</P>
<P>
Walking slowly with the aid of cane, the 84-year-old Brennan entered the side 
of the courtroom and took a seat in the audience moments before the 10 a.m. 
gavel. 
</P>
<P>
His former colleagues filed in. Then Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
addressed the retired justice: 
</P>
<P>
"The personal warmth which you radiate has enriched all our lives and has 
inspired all of us to maintain the cordial relations so necessary among those 
who may find themselves in disagreement." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 20 years, Rehnquist had clashed with Brennan in many of the major 
cases before the court. They not only quarreled in private over decisions, but 
lambasted each other in public and in their written opinions and dissents. 
</P>
<P>
But through it all, the two remained friends. 
</P>
<P>
The letter read by Rehnquist and signed by all the justices took note of 
Brennan's contributions during his 34 years on the court and closed with the 
wish that a respite from the court's heavy work load will "restore you to the 
good health which we so very much wish for you." 
</P>
<P>
In Brennan's reply, which was read aloud by Rehnquist, the retired justice said 
that he was "deeply touched" by the "gracious sentiments" of his colleagues. He 
said that he took comfort from "the expectation that our personal ties will 
endure in the years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Senate is expected to vote to confirm Brennan's successor, David H. 
Souter, a federal judge from New Hampshire. He could be sworn in and hearing 
cases by next week. 
</P>
<P>
On the first Monday in October, the court traditionally announces which of the 
summer appeals, more than 1,200 in all, will be granted a full hearing and a 
written decision. In addition, the justices heard arguments in four pending 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
The high court opened its term with only 57 cases scheduled for argument, the 
lowest number since 1954. In a typical year, the court hears and decides about 
150 cases, but last year only 132 cases were decided. 
</P>
<P>
No single explanation has been offered for the shrinking work load, although 
several justices have said that the court in the past granted review to too 
many cases. The result, they said, was frayed tempers and hastily worked out 
decisions during the spring rush before adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible explanation is that the increasingly conservative lower courts 
are more in tune with the conservative Supreme Court. Rehnquist noted recently 
that the justices often agree to hear a case because a majority believes that 
the lower court ruling is wrong. With appointees of Presidents Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush dominating the federal appeals court, Rehnquist and his 
conservative colleagues may be seeing fewer rulings that trouble them. 
</P>
<P>
The cases granted review Monday include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do federal anti-discrimination laws protect American workers employed 
abroad by U.S. companies? The Justice Department says yes, but a federal 
appeals court in New Orleans said no. The case arose when Ali Boureslan, a 
Lebanese-American, filed a civil rights suit against his employer, the Arabian 
American Oil Co. in Saudi Arabia. The appeals court said that Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act does not cover Americans abroad and threw out his suit. The 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission appealed. A ruling in the case (EEOC 
vs. Aramco, 89-1838) could affect the estimated 2.2 million Americans working 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is a journalist who deliberately alters quotations protected from a libel 
suit? Yes, said the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The 2-1 decision (Masson vs. 
New Yorker, 89-1799) threw out a suit filed by researcher Jeffrey Masson 
against author Janet Malcolm and the New Yorker magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has protected journalists and authors from libel suits over 
honest mistakes but not for falsehoods that display "actual malice." 
</P>
<P>
Author Malcolm taped hours of interviews with Masson but then used as 
quotations words that Masson did not utter. For example, Masson is quoted as 
calling himself an "intellectual gigolo" in the profile, but he says that he 
never used that phrase. Nonetheless, the appeals court threw out his suit 
because it said Masson's "many provocative, bombastic statements" on tape 
create the same picture as the words used by Malcolm. 
</P>
<P>
In a dissent, Judge Alex Kosinski said that the First Amendment did not give 
journalists a right to put false words into the mouths of their subjects.

COURT TO REVIEW 2 CALIFORNIA DRUG CASE RULINGS 
</P>

<P>
Heeding pleas from state prosecutors, the Supreme Court on Monday said it would 
review two cases in which California courts threw out drug evidence seized by 
the police. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a state appeals court ruled that policemen patrolling a high crime 
area in Oakland had no valid basis for chasing a fleeing young male, and, 
therefore, could not legally seize cocaine that he had thrown to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
In the second case, a state appeals court in Orange County ruled that police 
officers in Santa Ana acted illegally when they seized a bag full of marijuana 
from an auto trunk without obtaining a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp urged the Supreme Court to hear the cases 
because, he said, the California courts are in "hopeless disarray" on how to 
apply the 4th Amendment's ban on "unreasonable searches and seizures." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and police contend that the war on drugs has been hampered by 
hypertechnical applications of the 4th Amendment and the so-called 
"exclusionary rule." If officers are judged to have acted illegally in 
searching for or seizing evidence, the evidence is excluded from a trial, which 
often permits a crime suspect to go free. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Supreme Court, under conservative Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist, has shown sympathy for the prosecutors' view and has appeared to be 
on the lookout for cases in which drug evidence has been tossed out of court. 
But civil libertarians, as well as many state judges, say they worry that 
police officers are being given unfettered power to stop citizens and seize 
their belongings as part of the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland case began on the night of April 18, 1988, when two officers in a 
patrol car came upon four youths standing near a car parked at the curb. On 
spotting the policemen, the young men fled. The officers chased them. One young 
man made a wrong turn and nearly ran into an officer. Before he was caught, the 
youth tossed aside what later proved to be a lump of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Based on this account, a state appeals court ruled that police did not have 
"specific and articulable facts" of a crime in progress and, therefore, had no 
legal reason for chasing the young men. The cocaine evidence must be thrown 
out, the court said in the case (California vs. Hodari D., 89-1632). 
</P>
<P>
In March, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the state's appeal. But, 
on Monday, the high court justices announced that they would hear the case, 
probably in January. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County case arose when police officers in Santa Ana traced a 
shipment of marijuana as it was delivered to the home of J. R. Daza on West 
Stevens Avenue. Officers saw Charles S. Acevedo enter the Daza residence and 
come out a few minutes later with a full paper bag. He placed the bag in the 
trunk of his car and drove away. Policemen stopped Acevedo, opened the trunk 
and found a bag containing marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Based on this record, a three-judge court in Santa Ana ruled that officers 
should have obtained a warrant from a magistrate before entering the locked 
trunk. The state Supreme Court refused to hear this case also. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier rulings, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that officers who have 
evidence that a motorist has committed a crime may search his entire car. But, 
in other rulings, the court has suggested that a locked trunk containing 
luggage is entitled to a higher level of privacy than the rest the car. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Van de Kamp said that the case (California vs. Acevedo, 89-1690) 
gives the justices a chance to clear up the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
In a third case from California, the justices will decide whether Riverside 
County is violating the rights of arrested persons by holding them for up to 
five days before they are given a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that persons under 
arrest are entitled to a hearing within 36 hours. In 1975, the Supreme Court 
said that, when policemen arrest a suspect without having warrant, they must 
offer the suspect a "prompt hearing" before a magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the county said that California law calls for a hearing within 48 
hours and that they are "in full compliance with state law." But they concede 
that, when the courts are closed -- on weekends or holidays -- this 48-hour 
period could stretch into several days. The case (Riverside vs. McLaughlin, 
89-1817) will probably be heard in January.

<P>
NEW TV AD TARGETS CONCERNS OF L.A. VOTERS

<P>
The backers of Proposition 128 released a new television ad Monday designed to 
persuade voters that the environmental initiative they call "Big Green" will 
protect beaches from pollution, reduce smog and keep toxic chemicals out of 
food. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial, tailored for a Los Angeles audience, mixes images of waves 
lapping onto a polluted beach and a helicopter spraying pesticides into the 
air. It is narrated by actor Michael Landon and shows two small children 
holding hands at the beach and on a playground. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 128 protects our beaches from oil spills and sewage," Landon says. 
"Proposition 128 reduces air pollution. Proposition 128 removes 20 
cancer-causing pesticides from our food." 
</P>
<P>
The footage of the helicopter is an attempt to play on the emotional issue of 
malathion spraying, which is used to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly. The 
spraying angered thousands of Southern California residents this year. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have consistently maintained that malathion is not harmful to 
humans in the doses used during the eradication program. Backers have said 
malathion is not one of the chemicals that would be banned if voters approve 
Proposition 128 on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Peterson, press secretary for the Proposition 128 campaign, said the 
commercial will run only on Los Angeles stations for the next week. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which has relied heavily on donations from actors and other 
celebrities, has spent $250,000 to buy television time for the 30-second spot, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ad touches only briefly on several of the main elements of Proposition 128, 
a complex and detailed measure that also would provide funds to purchase 
ancient redwoods and to cut the use of chemicals contributing to depletion of 
the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative's sponsors also attempt to use the commercial to counter a spate 
of radio ads paid for by industry groups that oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, financed by the chemical industry and other businesses, has 
portrayed Proposition 128 as being too costly and attempting to do too much. 
Opponents also have branded the measure "the Hayden initiative" because one of 
its sponsors is controversial Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
Landon contends at the start of the commercial that "oil and chemical companies 
don't want you to listen to this message." 
</P>
<P>
As smoke belches from a smokestack at the end of the ad, he concludes: "Now 
those big companies are polluting our airwaves with ridiculous statements 
against 128. You know who they are. Don't believe their smoke screen."

Michel Leiris, a writer who helped lead the surrealist movement in the 1920s 
and later authored innovative studies of ethnic groups, has died at his country 
home, associates said Monday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
He died Sunday in the town of Saint Hilaire, southwest of Paris. The cause was 
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Leiris published his first work at the age of 25 -- a collection of poems. He 
became involved with surrealist writers and artists, and was a contributor to 
the movement's journal, "The Surrealist Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
He broke with the movement in 1929, and two years later joined a two-year 
research mission across central Africa. Upon returning to France, he published 
an account of the mission, "Phantom Africa," combining poetry and 
stream-of-consciousness prose with more traditional ethnological analysis. 
</P>
<P>
He also accepted a post at the Musee de l'Homme (Museum of Man) in Paris as 
head of its section on sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Later works included "L'Age d'Homme" (The Age of Man) and "La Regle du Jeu" 
(The Rule of the Game).

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
SMITH CALLS FOR CURBING PAGERS, JAILING FIRST-TIME DRUG DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith on Monday called for a 
ban on pocket pagers for minors and the creation of a "drug terminator" post in 
the attorney general's office as two steps to help fight illicit drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Saying "there are no magic formulas" to combat the drug crisis, Smith, at a 
sparsely attended Beverly Hills press conference, unveiled what he termed a 
"practical" six-point plan to confront the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on pagers, Smith said, would hamper drug deliveries by thwarting 
communications between drug dealers and their messengers. The "drug terminator" 
would work with federal and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate law 
enforcement anti-drug efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he also plans to push for the incarceration of all drug dealers upon 
their first conviction. The 11-year San Francisco district attorney 
acknowledged that in counties across California, including his own, most 
small-time drug dealers receive probation when convicted of their first 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign officials for Smith's rival, Republican Dan Lungren, questioned the 
San Francisco prosecutor's crime-fighting prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that in 1988, Smith's office prosecuted about 50% of those 
arrested for felonies in San Francisco, the Lungren campaign issued a press 
release stating, "Arlo talks tough during the campaign but fails to follow 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Such statistics, Smith said, are "irrelevant (because) any case which is 
prosecutable, we file on." 
</P>
<P>
Besides calling for penalties for drug dealers, Lungren, a former five-term 
congressman, has proposed confiscating the driver's license of casual drug 
users. Smith said that he favors "tough programs (for first-time users) which 
will require them to stay on treatment programs and community service." 
</P>
<P>
Smith called for expanded treatment programs for drug users and increased drug 
education programs in schools. If elected, he said he would implement a drug 
money laundering bill signed into law last weekend that requires merchants in 
California to report any cash transactions of more than $10,000.

GOVERNOR VETOES 2,299 BILLS IN HIS TWO TERMS

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed 2,299 bills during his eight-year Administration, 
more than the combined total of his two predecessors, according to final 
figures supplied by his staff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The vetoes represent a rejection rate of 15.1% of the bills submitted to the 
Republican governor by the Democratic-controlled Legislature during his 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The governor acted on the last bills of his term late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's immediate predecessor, Edmund G. Brown Jr., vetoed 736 bills 
during eight years in office for a rejection rate of 6.34%. Brown's 
predecessor, Ronald Reagan, vetoed 981 bills, a 7.29% rejection rate, during 
his eight years. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Deukmejian also established a record for a single year by vetoing 
436 bills out of 2,143 measures sent to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Here was a governor who for eight years was more fond of saying no than yes," 
said Robert Forsyth, press secretary to Senate Leader David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles). "With notable exceptions, he's been a governor who has not worked 
well with legislators. . . . Unless it's his vision that's being advanced, he 
has real problems accepting other people's visions." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's spokesman, Robert Gore, explained the high veto rate by saying 
that Deukmejian's legislative experience made him adept at spotting 
ill-conceived legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor spent 28 years in public life. He served 16 in the state 
Legislature," said Gore. "He's an expert at recognizing bills that are badly 
written or are bad legislation. Obviously, the voters agree with his philosophy 
since he was reelected by a margin of 1.7 million votes." 
</P>
<P>
Gore said about 70% of the bills that crossed Deukmejian's desk this year were 
passed in the Assembly and Senate in the final two weeks of the legislative 
session and often contained last-minute changes that were not thought through. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the figure was about 60%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For his total of eight years in office, Deukmejian signed into law 12,526 out 
of 14,825 bills sent to him. Brown signed 10,878 out of 11,614, and Reagan, 
12,468 out of 13,449.

CURTIS LEMAY, 83, BOMBER GENERAL OF WW II, DIES; 
</P>
<P>
WARRIOR: HE LATER BUILT THE STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND. HE WAS GEORGE WALLACE'S 
RUNNING MATE IN 1968.

Curtis Emerson LeMay, the tough bomber general who directed the smashing of 
German and Japanese cities during World War II and then built the Strategic Air 
Command into a powerful nuclear strike force, died Monday of a heart attack. He 
was 83. 
</P>
<P>
The four-star general relayed President Harry S. Truman's orders to drop 
nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending the war, despite his 
later-expressed belief that Japan could have been defeated with conventional 
incendiary bombs. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay died at 8:08 a.m. in the 22nd Strategic Hospital at March Air Force Base 
near Riverside, an Air Force spokesman said. He would have been 84 on Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, LeMay had been living in Air Force Village West, a retirement 
community for Air Force officers near the air base. Before moving there, he 
lived in Newport Beach for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the most patriotic and honest American I have ever known," said his 
son-in-law, James Lodge, in a telephone interview Monday night. "He cut a wide 
swath through a major part of our history. . . . He was a terribly interesting 
and dynamic man." 
</P>
<P>
He had remained in Southern California since he was fired from his 
post-military job as board chairman of a Chatsworth electronics firm for 
serving as the running mate of George C. Wallace in the 1968 presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
To an adoring American public during the war against the Axis powers, LeMay was 
"Old Iron Pants" and usually described as "cigar-chomping," "gruff" or 
"brusque." He was a strict disciplinarian who asked much of his fliers, but no 
more than he asked of himself. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding that his bombers were missing too many targets while zigzagging to 
avoid heavy flak over Europe, LeMay clamped a cigar in his jaw and personally 
led the next raid over Saint Nazaire, France, holding his plane on a 
straight-in course for seven perilous minutes. The next day he issued orders 
that there would be "no more evasive action on the final bombing run." 
</P>
<P>
His hero image began to fade somewhat during ensuing years as he continued to 
talk like a combat man, observing that most Americans had a "phobia" about 
nuclear weapons ("just another weapon in the arsenal"), and suggesting that 
North Vietnam be bombed "back into the Stone Age." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy surrounded him in the early 1960s when, as Air Force chief of 
staff, LeMay feuded with then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara over the 
latter's push to cut back the number of manned aircraft in favor of more 
intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
It intensified when LeMay saw fit to be Wallace's running mate, attracting 
demonstrators who chanted "Bombs away with Curtis LeMay!" He caused some 
embarrassment for Wallace by saying he would use nuclear weapons "if I found it 
necessary," a comment Wallace angrily contended was reported out of context. 
</P>
<P>
Already known as a man of few words, LeMay grew even quieter in retirement. 
When he reluctantly attended an Orange County soiree in 1984, the old warrior 
said only, "I just stay at home and keep my mouth shut. That's always the best 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
A pure military man, he did not go around in peacetime expressing regrets for 
his battle actions. "I have indeed bombed a number of specific targets," he 
conceded in the foreword of the 1965 book "Mission With LeMay," which he wrote 
with novelist and fellow World War II flier MacKinlay Kantor. "They were 
military targets on which the attack was, in my opinion, justified morally. 
I've tried to stay away from hospitals, prison camps, orphan asylums, nunneries 
and dog kennels. I have sought to slaughter as few civilians as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Off duty, LeMay was an enthusiastic ham radio operator, gun collector and 
big-game hunter. 
</P>
<P>
He was known for backing his men when they made understandable mistakes, but he 
did not tolerate the same mistake twice. 
</P>
<P>
Once, invited to dinner by a group of colonels serving under him, the crusty 
LeMay refused. "A man should have dinner with his friends," he growled. "The 
commanding general has no friends." 
</P>
<P>
LeMay was born in Columbus, Ohio, on Nov. 15, 1906. He was the eldest of six 
children of itinerant ironworker Erving LeMay and Arizona Dove LeMay. 
</P>
<P>
He was fascinated by airplanes from childhood. He recalled in his book seeing 
pioneer stunt aviator Lincoln Beachy flying around the 1915 Panama-Pacific 
Exposition in San Francisco. After Beachy crashed into San Francisco Bay and 
died, LeMay wrote, "I wondered a little where he had gone -- but mostly I 
remembered how he felt when he was alive and flying." 
</P>
<P>
He ached to go to West Point, but did not get appointed by his congressman, so 
he enrolled at Ohio State University as an engineering student, joined the 
Reserve Officer Training Corps and paid his way through college working in a 
foundry and at other jobs. He had to work so much that he did not get his 
degree until after he was in the service. 
</P>
<P>
He won a reserve Army commission through the ROTC, going on active duty with 
the 62nd Field Artillery Brigade at Camp Knox, Ky. He enlisted in the regular 
Army in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay got into air cadet school at March Field (now March Air Force Base), and 
by 1930 was a second lieutenant in the regular Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
He served in bomber and pursuit squadrons, participating in a 1937 goodwill 
flight of B-17 Flying Fortresses to South America. He was a pioneer of 
over-water navigation and of ferry routes to Africa via South America. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after World War II erupted, LeMay was a colonel in command of the 305th 
Bombardment Group. He took the group to England in the fall of 1942. As part of 
the 8th Air Force, it was one of the first U.S. air bombardment units to enter 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay flew five combat missions over Europe, winning the Air Medal and the 
Silver Star. In addition to leading the raid over Saint Nazaire to establish 
his rule against zigzag bombing runs, "Old Iron Pants" also led the Aug. 17, 
1943, shuttle mission of B-17s from England over Regensburg, Germany, and on to 
landings in North Africa, the first such mission flown. 
</P>
<P>
For his heroism in leading that attack on Germany's principal Messerschmitt 
plant at Regensburg, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Promoted to brigadier general and then major general, LeMay was commander of 
the 3rd Bombardment Division through mid-1944, then was sent to the 
China-Burma-India Theater to head the 20th Bomber Command. Under him, 
China-based B-29 Superfortresses attacked Manchurian industrial centers. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over the 21st Bomber Command in the Mariana Islands, LeMay ordered his 
bombers to fly at previously unheard-of low altitudes. He sent his full force 
of 300 B-29s on a nighttime incendiary raid on Tokyo. They flew at only 5,000 
feet, below the effective range of Japanese antiaircraft batteries, and dropped 
2,500 tons of firebomb clusters that set off a firestorm that burned out more 
than 256,000 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay piloted a B-29 on a record-breaking flight from Guam to Washington, D.C., 
just before the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
When the Air Force became an independent service in 1947, he was assigned to 
command U.S. forces in Europe, where he headed the 1948 Berlin Airlift to break 
the Soviet blockade. He flew several of the trips in and out of Berlin himself 
-- usually unannounced -- in order to straighten out problems. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1948, LeMay took over the Strategic Air Command, finding it to be 
made up of weary fliers left over from World War II. He set up headquarters in 
Omaha and built SAC into a proud, energetic outfit that kept nuclear-armed 
intercontinental bombers in the air around the world at all hours of the day 
and night. Aerial refueling was perfected. 
</P>
<P>
SAC went from 600 bombers and smaller planes at 18 bases to a force of 3,000 
hydrogen-bomb-carrying jets at more than 50 bases worldwide. LeMay saw to it 
that his men lived comfortably, and that there were plenty of hobby shops and 
other leisure facilities to keep them from getting bored. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, after heading SAC for eight years, LeMay became vice chief of staff 
for the Air Force. Months later, he set a record flying a giant jet tanker 
nonstop from Buenos Aires to Washington. The following year, he broke another 
record piloting a jet tanker from Tokyo to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy named him Air Force chief of staff, even 
though LeMay had already raised hackles by criticizing the Air National Guard 
as inefficient. Many thought he was simply too blunt for the job. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay tangled with Secretary of Defense McNamara over the RS-70 (formerly B-70) 
bomber program (which was halted by McNamara and Kennedy despite LeMay's 
support of it) and over McNamara policies that LeMay felt were leading to a 
narrowing of the U.S. military lead over the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
After he retired, LeMay said he thought McNamara's planned cutbacks in manned 
aircraft "may be signaling the end of the country." 
</P>
<P>
As board chairman of Networks Electronics Corp. of Chatsworth, which was headed 
by former Romanian fighter pilot Mihai D. Patrichi, LeMay was a civilian 
speaker popular with conservative groups. He was a hawk on Vietnam and saw that 
war as part of the overall attempt by communists to control the world. He 
wanted to "wipe out" Haiphong harbor. He thought the United States should pick 
"more expensive targets" in North Vietnam, warn people to evacuate and then 
bomb "like we did in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
LeMay was married to Helen Estelle Maitland in 1934. They had one daughter, 
Patricia Jane.

DRILLING BAN EXTENSION PASSES COMMITTEE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ORANGE COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS BUT SAY THEY 
WON'T BE SATISFIED UNTIL THEY WIN A LONG-TERM MORATORIUM WITH THE FORCE OF LAW.

<P>
Orange County officials who oppose offshore oil drilling claimed victory Monday 
when a key congressional committee approved another one-year extension of the 
ban on new drilling in federal waters off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
However, the officials said they still want Congress to enact a long-range 
drilling ban that would give the force of law to the offshore drilling 
moratorium for California and other states announced last June by President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terrific," said Laguna Beach Mayor Lida Lenney, one of four 
Orange County officials who traveled to Washington last month to lobby for the 
extension. "It's good news, but not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a enacting a long-term drilling moratorium, Lenney said Congress 
should designate the area between Orange County and Catalina as a new national 
seashore to afford it added protection. 
</P>
<P>
The drilling ban off California, which Congress has enacted each year since 
1981, was included in Interior Department funding legislation approved by the 
House Appropriations Committee. The Interior Department handles the lease of 
ocean tracts for oil and gas exploration and development for the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
None of the committee members directly challenged the California drilling ban. 
The committee turned back attempts to eliminate or reduce the scope of a 
similar ban on new oil drilling off Florida's panhandle and west coast but 
opened federal waters off of Virginia to new drilling. No immediate lease sales 
are planned in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year moratorium imposed by the Appropriations Committee, which must be 
approved by the full House and the Senate before it becomes law, also includes 
several areas that were left open to drilling by President Bush in June. 
</P>
<P>
In a long-awaited decision, the President ordered the Interior Department to 
delay for at least 10 years new oil and gas leasing off most of California, all 
of Oregon, Washington and southwest Florida, and New England north of Rhode 
Island. He postponed for at least six years new lease sales in a small number 
of tracts in California's Santa Barbara Channel and Santa Maria Basin, where 
rigs are pumping already. 
</P>
<P>
The measure approved by the Appropriations Committee bans drilling in those 
areas for a year and also includes a large section of the Gulf of Mexico south 
of the Florida panhandle, Alaska's Bristol Bay and sections of the Atlantic 
between Maryland and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"We want more than the President's statement in June. An executive order would 
be helpful," said Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), who has pushed for the annual 
drilling bans along with Rep. Leon Panetta (D-Monterey). 
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns about domestic oil production prompted by Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait, the House vote "shows that we can still use this moratorium process to 
protect the coast of California," said Robert H. Sulnick, executive director of 
the Santa Monica-based American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sulnick said, "I think what we need on this is law. While we're very 
happy that the President has a moratorium in place, we really need it to be 
codified" by the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who represents Orange County's south coast, also 
applauded the decision but said Congress is unlikely to enact a long-term 
drilling ban in the immediate future because of concerns over the national 
economy and the crisis in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who, like Packard, is a strong opponent 
of drilling off Orange County, said he has not discounted the possibility of 
congressional action on a multi-year drilling ban this year, especially if 
Congress is called into a lame-duck session in November. 
</P>
<P>
"The President won't be around for 10 years," Cox said. "While the political 
will exists (to enact a longer moratorium for California) we should pass such a 
provision. Strike while the iron is hot. I'm not so sure it might not happen 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery and Panetta had wanted to enact legislation giving the President's 
promise the force of law. However, the congressmen in July lost a bid to 
formalize the multi-year ban before the House Appropriations Interior 
subcommittee. They had planned to bring up the matter with the full committee 
but were dissuaded by congressional reaction to events in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of the changing world conditions . . . the timing was not appropriate 
to proceed," said Lowery. "We will revisit that another time." 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County officials who came to Washington to lobby committee members 
to keep the California drilling moratorium in place were John Sibley, chief 
deputy director of the Orange County Department of Environmental Management, 
Ruthelyn Plummer, a member of the Newport Beach City Council, and Pat McGuian, 
president of the Orange County League of Cities.

SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW RULINGS IN 2 DRUG CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Heeding pleas from state prosecutors, the Supreme Court on Monday said it would 
review two cases in which California courts threw out drug evidence seized by 
the police. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a state appeals court ruled that policemen patrolling a high crime 
area in Oakland had no valid basis for chasing a fleeing young male and, 
therefore, could not legally seize cocaine that he had thrown to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
In the second case, a state appeals court in Orange County ruled that police 
officers in Santa Ana acted illegally when they seized a bag full of marijuana 
from an auto trunk without having obtained a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp urged the Supreme Court to hear the cases 
because, he said, the California courts are in "hopeless disarray" on how to 
apply the 4th Amendment ban on "unreasonable searches and seizures." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and police contend that the war on drugs has been hampered by 
hypertechnical applications of the 4th Amendment and the so-called 
"exclusionary rule." If officers are judged to have acted illegally in 
searching for or seizing evidence, the evidence is excluded from a trial, which 
often permits a crime suspect to go free. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Supreme Court, has shown sympathy for the prosecutors' 
view and has appeared to be on the lookout for cases in which drug evidence has 
been tossed out of court. But civil libertarians as well as many state judges 
say they worry that police officers are being given unfettered power to stop 
citizens and seize their belongings as part of the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland case began on the night of April 18, 1988, when two officers in a 
patrol car came upon four youths standing near a car parked at the curb. On 
spotting the policemen, the young men fled, The officers chased them. Before 
one youth was caught, he tossed aside what later proved to be a lump of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Based on this account, a three-judge state appeals court ruled that police did 
not have "specific and articulable facts" of a crime in progress and, 
therefore, had no legal reason for chasing the young men. The cocaine evidence 
must be thrown out, the court said in the case (California vs. Hodari D.). 
</P>
<P>
In March, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the state's appeal. But, 
on Monday, the high court justices announced that they would hear the case, 
probably in January. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County case stems from the Oct. 30, 1987 arrest of Charles Steven 
Acevedo, then 21, who had left a West Stevens Avenue apartment that was under 
police surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
The surveillance was begun after Santa Ana narcotics Officer Don Coleman had 
been notified by a federal agent in Hawaii that a picnic cooler containing nine 
bags of marijuana was being sent by Federal Express to the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana narcotics officers waiting outside the apartment watched Acevedo and 
another man enter the apartment, then emerge with a brown paper bag that 
Acevedo placed in his trunk. The officers stopped Acevedo a few blocks away. 
Although they did not have a search warrant, the police searched his trunk, 
found the bag, and discovered that it contained about half a pound of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. of the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled that the 
search was illegal, but he noted that the police had a legitimate fear that the 
evidence would be gone once Acevedo drove away. Crosby agreed that the police 
were permitted to search the trunk and seize the bag. 
</P>
<P>
"But could the officers open the bag they lawfully seized?" Crosby asked in his 
ruling. "They could not without first obtaining a search warrant." 
</P>
<P>
In earlier rulings, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that officers who have 
evidence that a motorist has committed a crime may search that person's entire 
car. But in other rulings, the court has suggested that a locked trunk 
containing luggage is entitled to a higher level of privacy than the rest the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
In a third case from California, the justices will decide whether Riverside 
County is violating the rights of arrested persons by holding them for up to 
five days before they are given hearings.

CITY TO PAY $150,000 TO KIN OF MAN POLICE SHOT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana City Council agreed Monday to pay $150,000 to the family of a 
robbery suspect who was fatally shot in the back by a Santa Ana police officer 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 6 to 1 in a closed session to settle a lawsuit filed by the 
family of Ernest Henry Nunez. Nunez took a single shotgun blast to the back on 
Sept. 20, 1989, after he ignored a police officer's order to stop running, 
police said. Nunez, 31, died five hours later. 
</P>
<P>
His three children, who range from 10 to 13 years old, witnessed the shooting. 
Nunez was not carrying a weapon, police said. The district attorney's office 
ruled in February that there had been no criminal wrongdoing by police in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young said the city decided to settle the suit to avoid a trial 
and also the possibility that more would be owed to the family. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to protect the police officer from the agony of a trial," Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richards L. Norton said he voted against the settlement because he 
thought the amount was too much. Norton said that an internal police 
investigation showed that the officer had fired at Nunez because he thought the 
man was armed. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police said Nunez had five drug and burglary convictions in Orange 
County dating to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"The city attorney said he (Nunez) was a drug addict and was arrested several 
times," Norton said. "He was less than a successful member of society. I don't 
want to pay out good, hard-earned taxpayers' dollars like this." 
</P>
<P>
Nunez was suspected of robbing a clothing store in Orange, where his wife, 
Rosie, worked, two weeks before the shooting. There, according to police, he 
tied up his wife after she refused to give him money to buy drugs and fled with 
about $3,000 from the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
Police then placed the Nunez house in Orange under surveillance shortly after 
the robbery. The night of the shooting, police were following Nunez, who was in 
the family car as it traveled into Santa Ana. When Nunez realized that he was 
being trailed, police said, he tried to flee and was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Nunez filed the suit against the Santa Ana police last year. In the suit, 
she asked for more than $400,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday night, Nunez said the money that she will receive in the 
settlement. will pay for her children's education. 
</P>
<P>
"The money is not going to bring him back, and it's not going to compensate us 
much after all we have been through," Rosie Nunez said. "But it's enough right 
now to get back on our feet."

RENT-CONTROL GROUP GETS 23,000 SIGNERS

<P>
Advocates of rent control at mobile home parks submitted petitions bearing 
23,000 signatures Monday in an effort to qualify the measure for a citywide 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Anaheim Political Action Committee gave the city clerk petitions 
with the 23,000 names. The group needs about 15,000 valid signatures to qualify 
the initiative for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative calls for a rent ceiling at the 1988 rent level with an annual 
increase of 8%, or 75% of the consumer price index, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for some of the city's 29 mobile home parks called rent control 
"the worst form of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
"This initiative doesn't belong on the ballot, and it certainly should never 
become law in Anaheim," said Vickie Talley, executive director of Orange County 
Manufactured Housing Educational Trust. 
</P>
<P>
Renters in the city's mobile home parks said they expected the park owners' 
quick response and felt confident that the initiative would withstand any legal 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"What we would like is a special election," said Clarice Jackson, president of 
the committee. "Put it on the ballot and leave it up to the people of Anaheim. 
That's all we've ever asked." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the renters group collected more than the required number of 
signatures for a vote. But because of a technicality in the wording of the 
initiative, it failed a legal challenge and was never brought before the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
The city has 30 days to verify the new signatures. The petition then goes 
before the City Council, which must approve a mobile home park rent control 
ordinance or hold a special election on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is likely to become a political football in the hotly contested 
mayoral race on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Mayor Fred Hunter has been a longtime supporter of the renters since 
the issue first arose in 1984. His challenger for the mayor's seat, Councilman 
Irv Pickler, has consistently opposed rent control. 
</P>
<P>
Renters in mobile home parks represent about 8,000 potential voters in the 
city. LISA MASCARO

ELEPHANT JOINS THE RIDE-SHARE PARADE

Promoters of ride-sharing among Irvine Spectrum business complex workers are 
using a live elephant this week to get their message across. 
</P>
<P>
Adorned in tent-size signs proclaiming "Beastly commute?" and "Don't forget to 
ride-share," the elephant named Speck is part of California Ride-share Week. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County activities for Ride-share Week range from luaus in company 
parking lots to competitions between rival firms. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if an elephant doesn't get people's attention, nothing will," said 
Charity Gavaza, executive director of Spectrumotion, the Irvine Spectrum's 
transportation management association. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million pledge card-sweepstakes forms have been distributed 
through major employers, which qualify car-poolers for prizes including trips 
to Europe, Hawaii and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters can pledge by calling the Orange County Transit District's Commuter 
Network at (714) 636-RIDE. 
</P>
<P>
Local firms have scheduled transportation fairs at their facilities, including 
Lucky's in Buena Park, Disneyland in Anaheim, Hughes Aircraft Co. and the 
Marriott Hotel, both in Newport Beach, ITT Cannon in Fountain Valley, Emulex, 
State Farm Insurance and the Archive Corp., all of Costa Mesa, Humana Hospitals 
of Huntington Beach, JVC Co. in Cypress, and Alpha Beta Markets in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fairs will have representatives from bike shops, health and 
wellness clinics and sporting goods stores, OCTD General Manager James P. 
Reichert said. 
</P>
<P>
"If everyone in Orange County stopped driving to work alone just one day each 
week, we would reduce our freeway traffic congestion by 20%," Reichert said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans and OCTD will continue to monitor ride-sharing on Wednesday "Keep 
California Moving Day" to see if bus, van-pool and car-pool use increases.

CHILDREN CELEBRATE CENTENNIAL OF 'PUMPKINVILLE' SCHOOLHOUSE

Kindergarteners at West Orange Elementary School burst into applause after 
Principal Mary Elaine Kunz described the tiered birthday cake baked to 
celebrate the 100th birthday of their school tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have a sense of history at this age," said kindergarten teacher 
Ramona Kemp-Blair, "but they love birthday parties." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 600 West Orange students will join former staff and alumni for 
tonight's birthday bash and old-fashioned ice cream social at the oldest school 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, a 1966 graduate of West Orange, will deliver the 
evening's keynote speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I delivered my first speech ever before a public audience as a fifth-grader at 
West Orange," said Vasquez, who went on to speak at the 1988 Republican 
National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure my parents never envisioned at the time that I would go from making a 
speech in front of that little flagpole to a speech at the Republican National 
Convention," he said. "But I'm glad it all started there and I'm glad the 
school is still there." 
</P>
<P>
Just two years after the city incorporated in 1888, West Orange opened as a 
one-room wooden schoolhouse in an area referred to by some as "Pumpkinville," 
said local historian Phil Brigandi, who has written an account of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Originally at the corner of Flower and La Veta, the school was built after 
farmers on the west side of town threatened to form their own school district, 
complaining that the school in town was too far and the walk too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But the first West Orange Elementary, with its separate entrances for boys and 
girls, closed in 1905 due to a lack of students. It was reincarnated in 1924 as 
a six-room brick building on Almond Street, close to where the current school 
stands, Brigandi said. 
</P>
<P>
All that's left of the 1924 building are the bricks that form a planter out 
front, salvaged from a junk company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Kunz toured classrooms dressed in a turn-of-the-century 
schoolteacher's costume to help bring the school's history to life. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that West Orange doesn't stop at 100 years," Kunz 
told a group of fourth- and fifth-graders. "We keep going because this is our 
school. Right?" MARY HELEN BERG

DINNER NETS $30,000 TO AID AILING CHILD

An Italian dinner and dance raised about $30,000 to help Jason Peery, the 
20-month-old Tustin boy who was born with a rare heart problem and needs money 
for medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beyond our wildest expectations and hopes," said Police Sgt. Mike 
Shanahan, one of the event's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
The goal had been $20,000 to help Jason's parents -- Police Sgt. Jim Perry and 
his wife, Donna -- pay for physical therapy and necessary equipment for Jason. 
</P>
<P>
Jason has spent about half his life in the hospital and has undergone several 
major surgeries. After a high heart rate and lack of oxygen during one of the 
surgeries last spring left him blind and with brain damage, Jason needed 
regular physical therapy. Although the medical bills were covered by the 
family's insurance, the therapy is not. 
</P>
<P>
"It was phenomenal," said Donna Peery of the community's generosity. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was really responsive. Everybody was so emotional, too, that it was 
really touching. It was kind of hard to keep from falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers Shanahan and Luciana Principato, Jim Peery's longtime barber, had 
expected about 200 people and a total of $20,000. But more than 290 people 
showed up for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to set up more tables," said Shanahan, adding that Police Department 
employees and their spouses waited on tables. "We had so many people that we 
were busing the plates, cleaning them and then taking them right back out 
again."SHANNON SANDS

CITY'S PLAN TO BOOST CAR-POOLING PASSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Discount bus tickets, flexible schedules and preferential parking are some of 
the perquisites for city employees who car-pool under a plan passed unanimously 
by the City Council on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The city was required by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to 
come up with a plan by Oct. 4 after its previous plan was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
All organizations with 100 or more employees must submit plans that encourage 
people to car-pool between 6 and 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin has 712 employees who arrive at work between those hours. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives offered by the city include commuter matchups with other car-poolers 
and guaranteed rides home for employees who are required to work unscheduled 
overtime or have personal or family emergencies. In addition, employees who 
car-pool, walk or bike to work at least half of the time will get two extra 
days off each year, and those who do so 70% of the time will get four extra 
days off. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city is studying the possibility of implementing a four-day, 
40-hour workweek.

PAPERS GIVEN ADDED SHIELD IN LIBEL SUITS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: AN APPELLATE COURT RULING LIMITS THE MONEY THAT JUDGE CALVIN P. SCHMIDT 
CAN COLLECT IF HE WINS HIS ACTION AGAINST THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER.

In a decision that offers newspapers increased protection from libel suits, a 
state appellate court has sharply curtailed the amount of money that Harbor 
Municipal Judge Calvin P. Schmidt can collect if he wins his libel suit against 
the Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous decision released Monday, a three-judge panel of the 4th 
District Court of Appeal held that Schmidt cannot collect general or punitive 
damages from the newspaper if he wins his lawsuit because he served his demand 
for a retraction on the Register's editor. The California Civil Code requires 
that demands for retractions or corrections be served on the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
If Schmidt proves that the newspaper libeled him in 1988 and 1989 articles 
about a sex-and-influence scandal in Harbor Court, he can collect only 
"special" damages, which reflect out-of-pocket expenses to the plaintiff, such 
as attorney's fees, said his lawyer, H. Warren Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel said he will appeal to the state Supreme Court. The appellate court 
ruling allows newspapers a dangerous amount of freedom by making only one 
person -- the publisher -- the acceptable conduit for a demand for a 
retraction, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate for the courts to say that as a part of public policy in California, 
the press can disregard the truth because it knows it can't get hit for 
damages," Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel certified its decision for publication, meaning that it can be cited 
as precedent in libel cases in Orange, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. 
The judges reversed an April ruling by Superior Court Judge William F. 
Rylaarsdam, who refused to throw out large portions of Schmidt's suit. 
</P>
<P>
Register attorney Duffern H. Helsing could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt's lawyer had argued that the demand for retraction was proper because 
the newspaper's publisher had delegated authority to the editor. 
</P>
<P>
But the appellate court noted that although the editor often decides whether to 
publish a retraction or correction, ultimate authority rests with the 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that the Civil Code "unambiguously" requires that such demands 
be made to the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
"If the demand be mistakenly made on a subordinate, the publisher need not 
worry about a lawsuit for general or punitive damages," Associate Justice 
Edward J. Wallin wrote for the court. "The demand may be ignored without legal 
consequences unless it is served upon the publisher." 
</P>
<P>
In enacting that portion of the code, the court said, the state Legislature 
intended to "encourage a more active press by means of an increased insulation 
of newspapers from liability arising from erroneous published statements." 
</P>
<P>
The court noted that in his letter to the Register editor, Schmidt referred 
only to allegedly false statements made in a March 9, 1989, article, even 
though his lawsuit deals with two additional articles as well. The panel said 
that since Schmidt made "no demand" for retractions of the other two articles, 
"any claim for damages based on them is obviously barred."

EMPLOYEES ASK COUNCIL TO REMOVE 'THREATENING' LIBRARY CHIEF FROM POST

More than 70 librarians and their supporters Monday night asked the City 
Council to remove Library Director Rob Richard from his post because he 
"terrifies" his employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking that the city protect their employees by removing the library 
director," Ed Bentley, president of the Santa Ana City Employees Assn., told 
the council. "The fear is real in the libraries." 
</P>
<P>
The employees raised yellow flyers at the meeting asking that Richard be 
ousted. However, Mayor Daniel H. Young said the council will refer the matter 
to City Manager David N. Ream, who will report back in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley said the situation has gotten so bad that one of the librarians told 
him: "If I had a gun I would blow (Richard's) head off." 
</P>
<P>
Ream said he could not comment on the dispute because it is a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said the dispute stems from a disagreement with his employees over 
money. He said that he has "conflicts" with his employees but that he does not 
know why they are afraid of him. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley said tension between the librarians and Richard has been going on for 
more than two years. Librarians, who asked not to be identified by name, said 
their main dispute with Richard has been his management style, which they 
described as "threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Richard, who has been director for four years, is in charge of Santa Ana's 
three libraries -- the Central Library at the Civic Center and branches on 
McFadden Avenue and Newhope Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, librarians have been passing out anti-Rob Richard 
buttons with red circles stamped on his name. Richard has issued a terse memo 
forbidding librarians to wear the buttons while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
The librarians also say Richard has created intolerable working conditions for 
some employees because of a $1.6-million renovation project at the Central 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 60 employees and patrons were evacuated from the Central Library, 
which had just reopened after two weeks of asbestos cleanup. The 30-year-old 
library had to close again after more laboratory tests detected asbestos in a 
closed-off section of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Workers had to barricade the rear section of the building to remove mastic, an 
asbestos-based glue used to set the library's original tiles in place.

Regarding David Emmes' commentary "Storm of Controversy Over Public Funding 
Blows Ill for Arts," (Sept. 23): Mr. Emmes has difficulty understanding the 
furor conservative taxpayers are making over a "handful of change" given from 
public funds to a cause that violates our sense of decency and moral ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Let me ask Mr. Emmes how he would feel if public funds were allotted to pay for 
the Catholic sisters' living expenses, or perhaps he would not oppose the city 
of Costa Mesa supporting the choral directors in the local churches. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, in the name of art, Mr. Emmes would not mind giving some of his tax 
monies to the development of this art form. He implies that challenging 
traditional values is a good and needful thing, but when his values are 
challenged, he labels it bigotry. You see, Mr. Emmes, bigotry does exist on 
both ends of the moral spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that conservatives wish to silence all views but their own, or to take 
away anyone's right to say what he or she thinks or believes. It's that we 
object to their doing it with our money. Public funding must reflect the views 
of all those contributing to the said fund. Therefore, it will not be as 
"free-spirited" as that which is supported by a particular group. 
</P>
<P>
I ask Mr. Emmes, please don't ask me to support in any way those things that 
violate my moral and spiritual beliefs, and I will not expect to be seeing any 
of his monies in our collection plate. 
</P>
<P>
In these troubled times, more would be accomplished if we sought to understand 
those who oppose us, rather than resorting to accusations and name-calling. 
Perhaps, then, solutions could be reached.

In his third year as the Cougars' starting quarterback, Solliday continues to 
be one of the most consistently effective quarterbacks in Orange County. 
Friday, Solliday completed 12 of 16 passes for 134 yards in Capistrano Valley's 
37-13 victory over Servite. But his most important numbers were the four 
touchdown passes. Solliday, 6 feet and 175 pounds, now has 12 touchdown passes 
in five games this season, tops in the county. 
</P>
<P>
He also has completed nearly 64% of his passes for 930 yards with only one 
interception. Three of the touchdowns Friday -- of four, 23 and four yards -- 
went to Dave Poltl, a fellow three-year starter. Solliday said it's good to 
know that he has such a familiar receiver on his side. "I know what he's going 
to do and he knows what I'm going to do and that really helps a lot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
* Ace Chiles, who gained 138 yards in 13 carries -- including touch-down runs 
of 50 and 43 yards -- and recovered a fumble in Orange's 24-6 victory Friday 
over Western. 
</P>
<P>
* Scott Pannier, who had three interceptions to help Corona del Mar to a 10-9 
victory over Trabuco Hills Friday. 
</P>
<P>
* Daniel Niednagel, a Dana Hills cross-country runner who ran the fastest time 
in the county -- 14 minutes 51 seconds -- to win the Division I race at 
Saturday's Dana Hills Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
* Chris Reed, who completed 16 of 28 passes for 248 yards and two touchdowns in 
Katella's 28-14 victory over Estancia Friday. 
</P>
<P>
* Ryan Weir, who had 17 goals in four games to lead Corona del Mar to the 
championship of the South Coast water polo tournament. Weir scored four goals 
in the Sea Kings' 8-6 victory over El Dorado in the title game Saturday.

Carlsen wasn't happy with her performance in Corona del Mar's five-game victory 
over El Toro in the championship match of the Redondo Beach girls' volleyball 
tournament Saturday, but she nevertheless was named the tournament's most 
valuable player and Corona del Mar Dale Flickinger said Carlsen helped turn the 
match around in the final game. El Toro defeated the Sea Kings, Orange County's 
second-ranked team, 15-3, in the fourth game but Carlsen's hitting and blocking 
early in the fifth game helped Corona del Mar take a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After that El Toro got only as close as trailing, 9-4, and the Sea Kings won 
15-4. Flickinger said Carlsen, a first-team Southern Section 5-A selection who 
is featured this month in Volleyball Monthly magazine, has been a key player in 
the Sea Kings' early-season success. "She's one of our better hitters and the 
player most other teams key on," Flickinger said.

Other top performers:

for three miles -- to win the Division I race at the Dana Hills Invitational 
Saturday.

DISNEY PROMOTES 3 OF ITS VETERAN EMPLOYEES; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGEMENT: DISNEYLAND TO HAVE ITS OWN PRESIDENT. INSIDERS SAY THE DECISION WAS

Abraham Lincoln is no longer the only president that resides at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co., owner of the famed amusement park that draws about 13 million 
tourists a year, Monday named Jack B. Lindquist, a 35-year company veteran, to 
the newly created post of Disneyland president. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said Ronald K. Dominguez, vice president of Disneyland, will 
become the company's executive vice president for Walt Disney Attractions/West 
Coast, and Norm Doerges, vice president of Epcot Center Operations, will fill 
Dominguez's old post. 
</P>
<P>
Lindquist, 63, will take over direct management of Disneyland from Dick Nunis, 
president of Walt Disney Attractions. Lindquist will report to Nunis. 
</P>
<P>
While no official reason was given for the moves, company insiders said the 
restructuring was designed to help deal with the transition as Disney develops 
a new theme park in Southern California, either in Long Beach or Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The promotions also come at a time that Disneyland is also undergoing a 
long-term renovation and expansion. The company is considering adding new 
attractions and closing others. It recently backed down from killing its "Great 
Moments With Mr. Lincoln" exhibit when some frequent customers complained. 
</P>
<P>
Lindquist said he wants to get the company's attention back to its original 
theme park. Disney has devoted much of its best resources toward the building 
of new theme parks in Florida, Japan and Europe over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my first objectives is to get a bigger part of the attention . . . 
focused on Disneyland," he said. He called the 35-year-old theme park "so key 
and so important" to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Lindquist joined Disneyland a month after it opened in 1955 as its first 
advertising manager. Most recently, he held the position of executive vice 
president for creative marketing concepts in the Walt Disney Attractions 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
While he hopes to be involved in the development of a "second gate" theme park, 
he said he believes in maintaining high levels of service and quality at 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest challenge is to continue to operate this park with the same 
quality in the things we're noted for -- courtesy and the way we handle 
guests," Lindquist said. "The next biggest challenge is to deliver the kind of 
attractions and the entertainment and shows that will keep making Disneyland 
something that guests want to (keep returning to visit)." 
</P>
<P>
Lindquist is chairman of the Walt Disney Travel Co. and president of Vista 
Advertising and the company's Magic Kingdom Club. Over the years, he has worked 
to establish special events ranging from Grad Night for high school seniors to 
the Disney Pigskin Classic, a college football matchup last August. A Chicago 
native, he lives in Villa Park with his wife, Isabelle. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, who has worked at the park for 35 years, reportedly grew up on the 
Anaheim property on which Disneyland would later be built. After starting as a 
ticket taker and ride operator, he worked his way through the company's 
operations division and became an assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
He was named director of operations in 1970 and then vice president of the 
Disneyland Division. 
</P>
<P>
Doerges is a 23-year Disney veteran who is presently vice president in charge 
of Epcot Center Operations in Florida. Epcot Center is an internationally 
themed, second-gate amusement park next to Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
Doerges, 48, joined Disney in 1967 as pool manager at the Celebrity Sports 
Center in Denver. He moved to Disneyland in 1970 as an assistant area 
supervisor and a year later was transferred to Walt Disney World in Florida. He 
started there as an area supervisor and eventually was promoted to the position 
of manager in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
He became involved in coordinating and installing new projects and was the 
Florida vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering, the company's 
California-based design and engineering firm. He later took over his position 
at Epcot Center. A Denver native, Doerges is married and the father of two.

LIABILITY: NEWPORT PHARMACEUTICALS AND ITS INSURER AGREE TO PAY ABOUT $5.7 
MILLION IN TWO COMPLAINTS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY MISLED INVESTORS.

Newport Pharmaceuticals and its liability insurer have tentatively agreed to 
pay about $5.7 million to settle two shareholders' lawsuits alleging that the 
company misled investors in promoting an anti-AIDS drug in 1985 and 1986, the 
company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The civil lawsuits, which make identical complaints, were filed separately in 
state and federal courts in September, 1986. They accuse the company and 
several of its officers and directors -- among them founder and former chief 
executive Alvin Glasky -- of fraud and violations of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Newport has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The settlements would compensate those who bought Newport common stock between 
May 15, 1985, and Feb. 21, 1986. The terms call for Newport to pay $1 million 
cash and to issue shares of company common stock with a market value of between 
$1.75 million and $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plaintiffs would receive payments of $2.9 million from a 
company insurance policy that covers Newport's officers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
A condition of the settlement proposal is that it get the approval of a group 
of corporate senior note holders and of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
said Judith Woodward Archbold, an attorney for Newport. 
</P>
<P>
"In connection with the settlement, the court has not made and will not make 
any determination as to the liability of any defendant, and the company 
continues to deny any fault . . . ," the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
But Leonard Simon, attorney for the plaintiffs, said his clients continue to 
believe, as the lawsuits allege, that Newport Pharmaceuticals' officials 
personally profited by selling company stock at prices that were "artificially 
inflated" after they issued "false and misleading" statements about the drug 
Isoprinosine. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuits, the price of Newport stock increased by more than 
50% between April and September, 1985. That was the six-month period before the 
company filed for Food and Drug Administration approval to market Isoprinosine 
as a medication for people with conditions that often precede the onset of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, the suits allege, Newport insiders were "reaping large 
profits for themselves" by selling their stock. 
</P>
<P>
Newport stock plunged more than 50% on Feb. 21, 1986, the day that the FDA told 
Newport that Isoprinosine had been rejected as a pre-AIDS treatment. The FDA 
also criticized Glasky for misrepresenting results of clinical tests of the 
drug in public statements earlier that month. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's public statements "were too optimistic, and it turned out the drug 
wasn't approved at the time and it still isn't approved," Simon said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Archbold said the FDA last year recommended that there be more clinical tests 
of Isoprinosine in the United States. But, she added, Newport "can't afford to 
do them unless it gets additional public or private funding and support from 
the AIDS research community." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said, Newport, which lost $2.6 million for the first half of 
this year, is striving to become profitable by developing its mail-order 
pharmacy business.

TOSHIBA UNVEILS FIRST TV AD CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: COMMERCIALS CAPITALIZE ON CONSUMER FRUSTRATION WITH COPIERS.

<P>
It is a fantasy of almost everyone who has ever tried to fix the office copier. 
An employee, frustrated at the blinking message "Clear paper path," loads the 
copier with dynamite and blows it sky-high. 
</P>
<P>
That fantasy is being played out in Irvine-based Toshiba America's first-ever 
national television advertising campaign, which takes a lighthearted approach 
in marketing copiers as the machines that people love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
Another commercial in the Toshiba ad campaign, which debuted this week, shows a 
tow truck hauling an old, broken-down copier through an office building. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the ads strive to establish Toshiba as a reliable alternative to 
copiers that constantly break down. "Before your copier gets the best of you," 
the ads intone, "get a better copier." 
</P>
<P>
The goal, said Richard H. Walker, vice president of the copier products 
division of Toshiba America Information Systems, was to create a marketing 
campaign that will convince companies to consider Toshiba when they go shopping 
for a new office copier. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said the company's research has shown that the typical purchaser 
scrutinizes three or four brands of copiers from among 15 or so major brands on 
the market before making a final choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to get the Toshiba name among those finalists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker would not disclose the budget for the campaign except to say that the 
division's ad budget has been tripled over recent years. The ads were created 
by the Los Angeles agency Della Femina McNamee. 
</P>
<P>
"In focus groups, we found that copier users have a neutral/hate, not a 
love/hate, relationship with their copiers," said Peter Stranger, president of 
Della Femina. "As long as the copier works, the response is neutral. When the 
copier breaks down, users are reduced to primitive, angry emotions." 
</P>
<P>
The ads began Sunday during regional National Football League games on the CBS 
network. They will also air later this week during the National League and 
American League baseball playoffs, and during other NFL and collegiate football 
games during the season. In addition, they are being shown on Cable News 
Network, Financial News Network and the ESPN cable sports channel. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision makers and recommenders associated with the purchase of copiers 
were shown to be . . . people who would (tend to be) watching sports," Walker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company decided to try TV advertising to sustain its growth in 
copier sales, which he said have been relatively strong in an otherwise flat 
market. Until the production of the 30- and 60-second TV spots, the company's 
advertising efforts have primarily focused on industry trade publications. 
Still, the TV campaign will be supplemented by radio and print-media ads.

<P>
Benefiting in part from increased sales of its high-priced specialty drugs and 
a tight rein on operating costs, Bergen Brunswig Corp. on Monday reported a 
38.9% rise in net earnings for its last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange-based firm, a distributor of pharmaceutical products and home video 
cassettes, posted net income of $66.1 million on sales of $4.44 billion for the 
year ended Aug. 31, compared with net earnings of $47.6 million on sales of 
$3.92 billion for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the company posted net earnings of $14.5 million, up 35% 
from $10.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1989. Fourth quarter sales 
increased 12.6%, to $1.12 billion from $997.8 million for the same period the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Martini, the company's president and chief executive, attributed the 
good performance to strong sales in its drug and health care products and its 
ability to restrain operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the gross profit margin rate was slightly below the prior year, the 
contribution from the increase in sales and effective operating expense 
controls produced a significant improvement in operating earnings," he said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen Brunswig, which is Orange County's second largest public company in 
terms of sales, continues to ride on the coattails of its pharmaceutical 
products, particularly on the sales of its high-priced specialty drugs and 
biotech products, said John McRae, vice president of Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company has gained market share on competitors, including McKesson 
Corp. of San Francisco and Alco Health Services of Valley Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a shift in the availability and introduction of high-priced specialty 
drugs in that many are administered in the hospital environment," McRae said. 
"This helps Bergen (because) 40%-45% of Bergen drugs go to hospitals and are 
primarily used in cases of critical illnesses and by patients that need 
constant monitoring. This will go very much in Bergen's favor." 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward administering drugs in the hospital environment has just 
started and will accelerate in the next five years, he said. The company, 
maintaining a low debt and high cash reserves of about $100 million, is "in a 
very good position to ride through whatever economic downturn in the coming 
fiscal year," McRae said. 
</P>
<P>
Commtron Corp., Bergen's home video and consumer electronics subsidiary, also 
posted gains as a result of changes in its distribution method, said George E. 
Reinhardt Jr., Bergen's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
The unit's sales for the year were $554 million, just slightly above last 
year's $550 million. But net income was $9.2 million, up 17.6% from $7.9 
million last year. In the fourth quarter, Commtron reported net income of $2 
million on sales of $119.4 million, compared to earnings of $1.7 million on 
sales of $128.4 million in the same period in 1989.

AIRPORT CZAR;

<P>
NEW AIRPORT MANAGER JAN MITTERMEIER HAS COME A LONG WAY 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the doorway to her immaculate beige-on-beige home, threeclocks are visible 
and a fourth is coo-cooing somewhere in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Collecting timepieces is a hobby Jan Mittermeier shares with her husband of 32 
years and is not, she says with a gentle laugh and a shy shake of the head, 
testament to an obsession with time. 
</P>
<P>
Not that she's not obsessed with it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mittermeier, 50, the highest-paid woman in Orange County government 
and, as of last week, the new head of one of the nation's busiest airports, has 
been driven to the top of the heap by her perpetual fear of lost time. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was starting behind the eight ball," says Mittermeier of her venture, 
at age 34, into the professional job market after 16 years as a housewife and 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier is now among a handful of women around the country in top executive 
positions in aviation. In her $91,000-a-year job, she will manage Orange 
County's brand-new and expanded, $310-million airport, now the expected 
destination or departure point for 8.4 million passengers annually. Including 
general aviation flights, John Wayne Airport is the fifth busiest in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
She has come a long way from the studious girl who played clarinet in the 
Redondo Union High School band and dreamed of owning a cashmere sweater, then 
the rage. Money was tight for her family of three girls: her father, who 
eventually climbed through the ranks himself, was a construction worker trying 
to get by on an eighth-grade education. 
</P>
<P>
That modest background, she readily acknowledges, is part of what drives her to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
From a $12,000-a-year job as the county's first female auditor 16 years ago, 
Mittermeier has risen to what is arguably the most politically sensitive job in 
county government at the moment and one fraught with career minefields. 
</P>
<P>
Her much-criticized predecessor and former boss, George Rebella, quit abruptly 
two weeks ago, citing stress and illness. A week earlier, the new and expanded 
airport terminal had opened five months late and $17 million over budget. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stressful time for Mittermeier, recalled a co-worker. Then in the No. 
2 post at the airport, Mittermeier had received a hefty pay hike and had 
leapfrogged past her boss on the pay scale. His bitter jokes at staff meetings 
about his stagnating career made her uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
And while there was no personal animosity apparent between the two, their 
management styles could not have been more different: Mittermeier insisted on 
following through to the minutest, sometimes maddening, detail, while Rebella 
delegated responsibility whenever possible, others on the management team say. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier flinches when asked about their differences and brushes over the 
question of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gave a direction, whether I agreed with it or not, I followed it," she 
says. "He was my boss, and it didn't matter whether I was making more money 
than he was." 
</P>
<P>
County officials are counting on Mittermeier to work out any remaining airport 
kinks -- including a lawsuit brought by the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
And she is not one to shy away from a good fight, recalls her former boss, 
Orange County Auditor Steve E. Lewis. Indeed, says Lewis, "She relishes it. If 
she gets into a battle, she's going to win." 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, most housewives stayed home. Mittermeier, whose husband Ron owned his 
own printing company, did not have to work to get by. She wanted an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more exciting than anything else," Mittermeier recalled of the moment 
she finally decided to try for a degree and a career. "Most of the other women 
in our circle of friends didn't work at all. They really didn't believe I was 
doing it. They said, 'Gosh, I'd love to do that, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
She had waited until Keith, her youngest, had started first grade. By then, 
Kevin was 10. She juggled her classes at Cal State Long Beach so that she could 
be home in the morning when her sons went off to school and in the afternoon 
when they returned. 
</P>
<P>
Her teachers often urged her to switch majors because women weren't being hired 
as accountants, she recalled. She refused and four years later finished her 
degree in accounting. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, she began making the interview circuit with competitors who for the 
most part were at least 10 years her junior -- and male. Mittermeier had 
expected tough competition, she recalled matter-of-factly, and had prepared for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was going to be competing with much younger people so I set out to 
make myself more competitive. I set out to get all A's." 
</P>
<P>
She missed by one point in one class. In another class she managed an A despite 
a zero on a missed test. She had studied hard, but just as she picked up her 
pencil to begin, she was called from the classroom by a school security guard 
-- her son had broken his thumb at ball practice. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher did not allow make-ups, so Mittermeier had only one way to get an 
A: a perfect score on the remaining tests. She did it: "There was no margin for 
error." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her A average, however, Mittermeier found the interview process with 
private industry -- even with some of the Big Eight accounting firms -- 
degrading. Under pressure from the federal government, some firms were 
beginning grudgingly to hire "a token woman," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But prospective employers frequently asked her both how she would care for her 
children and whether her husband would permit her to work outside the home, 
questions now illegal under federal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier turned down an offer with one of the major firms, she said, taking 
a job with the county because she had been treated more professionally. 
</P>
<P>
As the first woman auditor in the county, Mittermeier faced some tense moments. 
When she entered a conference room for a high-powered meeting, men sometimes 
did a double take. Other times they would look crestfallen and say they had a 
joke (apparently off-color) they'd been planning to tell to kick off the 
meeting but would have to skip it. 
</P>
<P>
Did they ever accept her as one of the boys and tell the joke anyway? "No," 
answers Mittermeier. "They cleaned up their act." 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier is soft-spoken, but people listen when she talks and usually regret 
it when they do battle with her. Co-workers are more apt to describe her as 
"respected" than "popular." 
</P>
<P>
"She knew or was smart enough to back off when she had to," county auditor 
Lewis recalled. "But she was not a compromiser. She didn't have to yell. People 
just knew that no one was going to beat her on anything." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Mittermeier's impressive track record, she admits to self-doubts and a 
nagging fear of failure. 
</P>
<P>
So driven is she to succeed, recalled a co-worker at the auditor's office, that 
she was crushed when she was named chief of audits. She had been shooting for 
the deputy auditor slot, which would have made her second-in-command in the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of times, I'm real cognizant of three o'clock in the morning. I lie 
there, and I worry a lot and think about what I have to do the next day. And 
sometimes I can't get back to sleep," says Mittermeier. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that I would try my hardest and fail at something -- I think that 
would be my biggest fear. Sometimes I have a hard time relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
That's not hard to believe. Her home is fastidiously uncluttered. One small 
painting of flowers adorns a wall. There is no trace of dust, let alone 
cinders, in the fireplace. The only break in the otherwise linear home is a 
spiral staircase, striking in contrast. 
</P>
<P>
Her jeans look ironed and her red crew sox match her turtleneck. 
</P>
<P>
She works out to Jane Fonda in the morning, never diets but never binges on 
junk food, and has the lean, 5-foot-6, 110-pound body of a teen-ager. With 
loose blonde ringlets that soften her sharp features, she could pass for a good 
10 years younger than 50. 
</P>
<P>
She never watches television and rarely goes to movies. To relax, she reads 
mysteries and gardens. Pink and purple impatiens, arranged by hue, line the 
lawn, which is, of course, free of weeds and clipped like a flat-top haircut. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier does not like to feel out of control, which leads to another slight 
fear of hers, one that might not even be worth mentioning were it not for her 
current job. 
</P>
<P>
Now, don't get her wrong. Mittermeier finds it thrilling to watch the sudden 
speed of a jet at take-off, a sight she says is "awesome." And she does take 
commercial flights when she has to. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County's new airport czar would just as soon stay on the ground. 
Flying makes her, well, not really afraid, but sort of nervous: "It always 
feels a little unnatural being 37,000 feet in the air and moving at 700 miles 
an hour."

MEMBERS OF THE NEW YOU GUILD OF THE OPERA PACIFIC GUILD ALLIANCE REGULARLY GET 
TOGETHER FOR WORKOUTS AND/OR EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS.

". . . OK, almost done. Can you feel that? Two more . . . now let's switch to 
the other side. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen women are stretched out on the floor in front of instructor 
Caroline Everette, performing an exercise that benefits both their inner thighs 
and their favorite cause: Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The women are members of the New You Guild, the most recent addition to the 
Opera Pacific Guild Alliance. Each month, members get together for a workout 
and/or educational session. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had programs on yoga, low-impact aerobics, tap-dancing and stretching," 
says Nancy Jaffee, who chairs the guild. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent meeting was a combination of exercise, nutrition instruction 
and a health-conscious lunch, all provided by Le Meridien Hotel in Newport 
Beach, where Everette, a fitness buff and former opera singer, is employed. 
</P>
<P>
What do opera and fitness have in common? Both consider the human body a 
valuable instrument, the more finely tuned, the better. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a fitness guild was born not in health-obsessed Southern 
California, but in Miami, where an opera fitness guild was formed last year. 
Laila Conlin, president of the guild alliance, heard about the idea and thought 
it would work in Orange County as well. So she asked Jaffee, who already worked 
out regularly, to lead the group. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen Opera Pacific supporters have signed up for the guild, although 
not all of them participate in the exercises. "A lot more come for the lunch," 
Jaffee says. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the hotel's French theme, Everette shared one of her favorite 
tips for exercising while traveling. "I used to take weights with me, but that 
wasn't very practical," she said. "And I also took along bottled water. So one 
day it occurred to me that I could use the water bottles as weights. You can 
carry them empty, and then fill them with water or even sand when you get to 
your destination." 
</P>
<P>
Everette asked the makers of Evian water to donate some samples for use as 
weights for the guild's exercise session. "They told me, 'We've had promotions 
before, but never anything like this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Participants used the bottles as weights for arms, legs and even stomachs. 
Everette's choice of music for the session, of course, was classical music and 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Ooh, 'Madame Butterfly!' " Conlin exclaimed when she heard an excerpt from one 
of her favorites. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the water bottle weights, Everette also provided extra water for 
drinking and a brief lecture on the importance of proper hydration. 
</P>
<P>
"Your thirst lags behind your need for water, so don't wait until you get 
thirsty," she said. "You should drink 8 ounces before exercising, 4 more ounces 
every 15 minutes and another 8 ounces within 20 minutes after exercise." 
</P>
<P>
After a 45-minute workout, the group adjourned to another room for a 
presentation by chef Pamela Sheldon on the virtues of olive oil, which several 
studies have found may reduce the risk of heart disease. Guild members and 
guests then were treated to an olive oil tasting, dipping chunks of fresh bread 
into sample cups of oil and rating them for color, taste and aroma. 
</P>
<P>
Olive oil, the group learned, contains mono-unsaturated fat, which is now 
considered healthier than other forms, including polyunsaturated fat. It's 
still fat -- about 115 calories a teaspoon -- but Sheldon said a healthful diet 
could include up to 30% fat. 
</P>
<P>
"Olive oil is the only edible oil available that's cold-pressed and not derived 
from heat," Sheldon said. "That makes a difference in cooking." 
</P>
<P>
The New You Guild isn't the first Opera Pacific support group to combine 
fund-raising with a favorite activity, Conlin said. Other guilds cater to 
gourmet diners, bridge players and travel buffs, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it because it helps me stay fit and also helps the opera," Jaffee said. 
"And it's fun to get together with people who have similar interests." 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, the women drew curious stares as they walked from the meeting 
room to the patio. "Now that's a diverse group," said one onlooker, as the 
women, clad in everything from Spandex and sweats to dresses and high heels, 
strode past. 
</P>
<P>
"We are diverse," Conlin said later. And although she'd like to get more women 
involved in exercise, that will never be a prerequisite for participating in 
guild activities. "A lot of people may not be interested in exercise, but 
they're still interested in a healthy diet. It's whatever you want to do to 
improve yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Lunch featured recipes by Jacques Maniere, an innovator in fitness cuisine, 
including breast of chicken, steamed vegetables and dried fruit compote for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
It's too soon to say whether the New You Guild will follow the lead of its 
Florida counterpart. "They put together a video called Operaerobics," Conlin 
said. "So that name's taken. 
</P>
<P>
"But we might do Operacize."

BEASTS ARE BLESSED WITH A BENEFIT DINNER;

A FRIENDS OF THE SANTA ANA ZOO EVENT RAISED FUNDS FOR A MONKEY HABITAT TO BE

<P>
Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo tossed a party last week in the courtyard outside 
Prego restaurant in Irvine, drawing about 100 guests at $40 each for no-host 
cocktails and a buffet of Italian specialties. The benefit raised $5,500 toward 
the construction of Monkey Island -- an 18,000-square-foot, cageless habitat to 
be built next year. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is to be the first of 50 major projects planned for the zoo, said 
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who sipped red wine and pressed the flesh of 
his constituents. Young said the zoo board has a master plan that calls for 
approximately $20 million in construction and renovations at the city-owned 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate private funding for 90% of that," said Young, "so we're probably 
talking about a 10-year plan."

H Iko -- a 5-year-old squirrel monkey on a leash. The handlers (from Pacific 
Animal Productions in San Diego) gave each guest a sunflower seed to feed shy 
Iko, who reached into strangers' hands for the treat, then scampered back up to 
perch on familiar shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Animal Attractions 
</P>
<P>
Also there were Cleo the constrictor, Marcy the opossum, Pedro the parrot, Iggy 
the iguana, Barney the barn owl and a pygmy hedgehog named Spot. "These animals 
are really used to all the attention," said zoo volunteer Elta Chapman, who, 
with staffer Karen Cress Cribbs, brought the animals out of their cages one at 
a time and held them. "This is like our little movable petting zoo." 
</P>
<P>
Zoo board members Judy Fluor-Runels and Bradd Linn stroked Marcy's shaggy fur 
as Fluor-Runels asked about possum diet, sleep habits and behavior. "So will 
she have babies or no?" Fluor-Runels asked in conclusion. (No, Chapman said.) 
</P>
<P>
Checking out Barney the owl, Karen Amies joked about the thick feathers in the 
center of his face. "How would you like to get up in the morning and brush your 
nose?" she asked her husband, Grif. (Not much, he said.) 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Sion and Sharon Ballidis reached out and touched Cleo the constrictor, 
and Sion talked about her two grown daughters' having done volunteer work at 
the zoo when they were teens. "They were always very animal-oriented," Sion 
said. "It was a great experience for them. They learned how important the 
hands-on part of the job was -- and they loved taking the animals out of their 
cages and communicating with them."

The Orange County Black Actors Theatre has taken what its founder described as 
"a first step toward a permanent home." The 8-year-old amateur troupe, which 
has produced shows most recently in Brea and Anaheim, on Monday leased a 
basement space here at 410 W. 4th St. 
</P>
<P>
Adleane Hunter, the troupe's founder and producing artistic director, said she 
hopes to put in a 100-seat theater by next June -- if $15,000 can be raised to 
equip and renovate the 2,000-square-foot space. Until then, it will be used for 
workshops and rehearsals and as an office. 
</P>
<P>
The lease costs $1,100 per month, Hunter said, and runs through Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
She said the cost will be defrayed by a recent $12,500 grant from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe hopes to stage productions this season at other theaters around the 
county -- "The Trial of One Short-Sighted Black Woman vs. Mammy Louise and 
Safreeta Mae," by Marsha Leslie, at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove from Jan. 
24 to Feb. 17; and "Fences," by August Wilson, at the Curtis Theatre in Brea 
from April 26 to May 18 -- before opening the new space June 27 with "The 
Colored Museum," by George C. Wolfe. However, Hunter said, rights to "Fences" 
and "The Colored Museum" still must be secured. 
</P>
<P>
She also said acquiring the new space does not change the troupe's desire to 
become a part-time resident company at Brea's Curtis Theatre, where it 
showcased "Ain't Misbehavin' " in April. JAN HERMAN

'I SAY THROW THOSE GROVE BUMS OUT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Mr. Herman: 
</P>
<P>
I've been reading about the financial troubles of the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival in your newspaper. There have been stories in the Orange County news 
section, in the Calendar section, in the View section. 
</P>
<P>
Don't reporters for The Times have anything better to write about? 
</P>
<P>
I say throw those Grove bums out. Get rid of them. Wash them out the door with 
a hose. I'd even say nuke 'em, if I were sure we wouldn't have to bury the 
waste products in our own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
My name is C.M. Jerks, and the reason I don't enjoy all this brouhaha is pretty 
simple. Those theater bums are out of step with the times, with the people and 
with the moral climate of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
I fully support the City Council majority in its refusal to help the Grove out 
of its cash shortage. 
</P>
<P>
What was the first play they put on this season at the Grove? A 322-year-old 
Frenchified comedy called "The Miser" about a crotchety bachelor who loves 
money more than anything else and buries a pot of gold in his back yard. What 
has that got to do with us? 
</P>
<P>
I know there's a lot of material wealth around here. I'm not stupid. But I 
don't remember hearing about anybody burying a pot of gold in his back yard. Do 
you? 
</P>
<P>
And just who is this Moliere character who wrote the play? Some bankrupt 
libertine who didn't even go by his own name, that's who. He attacked organized 
religion. He made fun of the middle class. He satirized doctors and lawyers. Is 
that the kind of drivel we should be subjected to? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
Next, those theater bums put on not one but three plays by an Englishman named 
Shakespeare. Count them: "Much Ado About Nothing," "As You Like It" and 
"Othello." Come on. Three plays by the same guy? Doesn't anybody at the Grove 
realize there are plenty of other writers around? And I'm not just talking 
about American writers. I'm not that provincial. 
</P>
<P>
The first play took place in Italy. Who is Shakespeare trying to kid? Is this 
guy Italian or English or what? He sounds bogus to me. On top of that, he's 
even older than Moliere. The second play had a woman running around trying to 
pass herself off as a man. That should have gotten an X rating right there. 
</P>
<P>
The third play, though, really went beyond the pale. In it, a black man marries 
a white woman and loves her so much he kills her out of jealousy. I am no 
racist, but I found the interracial sex exceedingly offensive. And I would 
think that black people would be offended, too. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't surprise me that Shakespeare would trample on a sensitive issue like 
that, and with such relish. I have heard rumors that he had illegitimate 
children. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't he a monumental plagiarist? 
Didn't he steal his plots from other writers? Isn't there a question about 
whether he wrote his own plays at all? 
</P>
<P>
For a theater troupe to give voice to a writer of questionable character seems 
to me inexcusable. And to do so by devoting almost its entire schedule to him 
seems totally unreasonable. Such a writer does not deserve a platform in Garden 
Grove or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime -- to add insult to injury -- those theater bums are about to 
mount a play by someone even less reputable than Shakespeare. The play is 
called "The Importance of Being Earnest," and its author is Oscar Wilde. 
</P>
<P>
In case you didn't know it, Wilde was a notorious homosexual. Personally, I 
have nothing against homosexuals. I'm much more tolerant than that. They have 
their place, just like Catholics and Jews, blacks and yellows, the physically 
challenged, the lesbians, all the minority groups that compose our multiracial, 
multiethnic, equal-opportunity society. 
</P>
<P>
But you have to draw the line somewhere. Frankly, I wish the Grove's cash 
crisis had forced those theater bums to cancel "The Importance of Being 
Earnest" instead of Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales." 
</P>
<P>
The poetic blatherings of a Welsh drunk like Thomas, deplorable though they may 
be, would constitute a less dangerous threat to community standards of decency 
than a facile comedy by a homosexual Irish dandy whose wit is liable to find 
favor with high-minded reviewers such as yourself. 
</P>
<P>
I would appreciate it if you would run this letter without any cuts. A friend 
of mine doubts that you will. She says all you media folks love to slant the 
news, and that any point of view opposing yours is not likely to get much of a 
hearing. Please prove her wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Yours sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
C.M. Jerks 
</P>
<P>
P.S: My friend also warned me not to tell that my initials stand for Council 
Majority. It's an unusual name, which is why I never use it. I just go by my 
initials.

FOCUS ON THE NEW GERMANY;

OLD FEARS AWAIT THE COMING OF ONE GERMANY

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
" . . . We remember the unending suffering that has been brought on people in 
the name of Germans. We remember all the victims of war and tyranny. We unite 
with the will that all this never again be allowed to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 -- West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher speaking in Parliament 
during the Sept. 20 unification debate. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age faces were as bright and hopeful as the morning outside, yet the 
words of those who spoke were hedged with doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Two generations removed from the weight of the Holocaust and the Nazi 
occupation of their country, the Dutch students discussing German unity had no 
fear that a united, democratic Germany might somehow resume its military 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the concern was more subtle. It was there, but ill-focused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the Germans as enemies, and I don't think there is going to be 
another war," said Minke de Vroomen, 19, before pausing to add, "But now that 
Germany is becoming one, it's a little worrying." 
</P>
<P>
The words -- "a little worrying" -- capture the main thread of a remarkably 
broad mix of emotions that flow through Europe on the eve of a new era -- an 
era where an anxious Continent once again hitches its fate to a powerful, fully 
sovereign Germany. 
</P>
<P>
From the enfant terrible of the French Establishment, Alain Minc, who argues in 
favor of arming a united Germany with nuclear weapons, to the anguished voices 
of the German left, who insist that history and Auschwitz cry out against unity 
of any kind, the Continent braces itself to receive the new nation about to be 
born. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes that the new Germany is far different from the nation that 
twice this century took the world to war. 
</P>
<P>
Germany today is prosperous, confident and, above all, democratic. The 
awareness of both past misdeeds and future responsibilities is enshrined in the 
preamble to the unification treaty and has become a litany in public speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions surrounding the new Germany's arrival also give reason for hope. 
The nation has no outstanding territorial disputes, it has unilaterally 
renounced nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and has begun a 
self-proposed, self-imposed military manpower cut of 40% to 370,000. 
</P>
<P>
It begins life in a peaceful, optimistic Europe, firmly anchored in the 
Atlantic Alliance and the European Community, and richer than ever before in 
the Western values of rationalism, pragmatism and egalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty years have brought enormous change," said former Chancellor Helmut 
Schmidt during an interview. "Democracy is deeply rooted in the German 
Parliament. It's not just lip service. They have understood and taken to heart 
how a democracy works." 
</P>
<P>
But if such ideal conditions prevail, why do doubts about Germany persist? 
</P>
<P>
Why does Newsweek publish stories under the headlines "Can Germany Be 
Contained?" and (from a German contributor) "We Can Be Trusted"? 
</P>
<P>
Why does British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher describe German unification 
as "something we'll have to cope with," and why does one of her Cabinet 
ministers openly accuse Germany of trying to dominate Europe? 
</P>
<P>
Why did the collapse of the Berlin Wall last November prompt a European 
Commission member in Brussels to launch into an anti-German tirade during an 
off-the-record meeting with a group of reporters, or inspire a Dutch comedian 
to suggest that his government might do well to buy the wall and erect it along 
the Dutch-German frontier? 
</P>
<P>
Size alone explains part of it. 
</P>
<P>
From this small Dutch administrative town 25 miles north of Amsterdam, a united 
Germany that is more than half again the population of France or Britain is 
Europe's acknowledged economic powerhouse, and, at birth, is the world's No. 1 
trading nation (ahead of the United States and Japan), seems somehow 
frighteningly large. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we are completely dependent on Germany," said Ilja Roobeek, an 
18-year-old Dutch student. 
</P>
<P>
History, too, lingers. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Norway this year finally relented and allowed German military 
forces to be part of annual Western alliance maneuvers for the first time since 
the war; that officials of European Community nations have given up 
guilt-tripping their German colleagues as a way to leverage more money, and 
that a recent sampling of French opinion found that if a daughter were to marry 
a non-Frenchman, the overwhelming majority of families would prefer a German 
son-in-law -- all this reflects the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the wound itself remains. 
</P>
<P>
"Memories (of the Nazi occupation) are still there," said Norwegian Foreign 
Ministry spokeswoman Mette Owre, explaining the public resistance to the 
participation of German forces in northern Norway maneuvers earlier this year. 
"Emotions are weaker now, but it is still hard." 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, an additional dimension to Europe's wariness: an uneasy 
suspicion that, for all their postwar success and commitment to the future, the 
Germans remain an unpredictable people, capable of being blown off course with 
frightening speed. 
</P>
<P>
The shadow of the Third Reich may have faded, but when events in Europe turn 
tricky, the same question invariably percolates to the surface: Can we count on 
the Germans? 
</P>
<P>
"We Germans remain an endangered people," said Schmidt in the final chapter of 
his recently published book, "Germany and Her Neighbors." "Not because of any 
external threat; there's no fear of that at present. But because of our 
tendency to nervousness, overreaction and arrogance. These tendencies have 
often led us astray in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt elaborated on this German volatility not with an anecdote from an 
earlier age, but by citing an example 30 years into Germany's postwar 
democratic experience: the explosive growth and subsequent rapid decline of a 
peace movement whose strength threatened to overturn the decision to station 
U.S. medium-range nuclear missiles in West Germany during the late 1970s and 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"It just flared up," he said. "It misled people outside of Germany. They 
thought we'd be too weak to carry that decision out. It misled (former Soviet 
leader Leonid I.) Brezhnev and (former Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A.) 
Gromyko. Doubt also grew in the West that they could rely on the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
From his 13th-floor office overlooking Brussels, Germany's senior European 
Community representative, European Commission Vice President Martin Bangemann, 
addressed the same point. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that there's a great deal of emotion and nervousness in German 
society, much of it reinforced by the media," he said. "But this doesn't make 
us more dangerous (to others). It makes us weaker. We are much more dangerous 
to ourselves than others." 
</P>
<P>
While the Germans are certainly not the only people in Europe with such 
cultural traits, their collective power and geographical position set them 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
A united Germany, for example, shares its borders with nine other countries. 
Only China and the Soviet Union have more neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
While Europeans can view instability in, say, Greece, Portugal or Denmark with 
a certain detachment, mood swings in Germany make them jumpy. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are successful, they are afraid we will become too successful; if we are 
unhappy, they are afraid we'll become too unhappy," said Schmidt. "Due to its 
geographical position in the middle of Europe and the fact it's a country of 80 
million people, Germany is always going to give some concern to its neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
The German propensity for volatility precedes the tragedies of this century. 
</P>
<P>
French social observer Alexis de Tocqueville, after dissecting the Americans in 
the 1830s, went on to single out France's eastern neighbor, noting in a letter 
to a friend that "alone in Europe, the Germans possess the particular talent of 
becoming obsessed with what they take as abstract truths without considering 
their practical consequences." 
</P>
<P>
A century later, in the ashes of the Third Reich, the respected early postwar 
German scholar Friedrich Meinecke made a similar, rueful assessment that German 
temperament had always contained "a stormy inclination to rise up suddenly from 
the limitations of the reality that surrounded it. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
As a new Germany embarks on the daunting challenge of rebuilding its eastern 
half, outsiders fret over how its democracy will resist such inclinations as it 
moves into the troubled, uncharted waters that seem certain to accompany the 
early years of unification. 
</P>
<P>
Where compassion, flexibility, patience and innovation are needed now as never 
before in absorbing an emotionally shattered East German population, many see a 
culture overly seasoned with bureaucratic rigidity, preoccupied by the need for 
order and marked by an insensitivity that frequently spills over into 
arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in the fated nature of people; it is a form of racism to 
accept this idea of determination of a people," said Simone Veil, who survived 
Auschwitz to become one of France's most prominent and influential postwar 
political figures. "On the other hand, the caricatures often conform to 
reality. For the Germans, this is discipline, respect for authority and 
efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
In the years of Western Europe's postwar recovery, these strengths first 
propelled West Germany's Wirtschaftswunder, then enabled the country to remain 
the Continent's strongest economy. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans may lament an erosion in their own work ethic and complain that 
East Germans are lazy, but the fact remains that West Germans maintain one of 
the world's highest industrial productivity rates, and statistics show that the 
East German worker outperformed his counterparts in all the former Communist 
Bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the director of the respected Allensbach Institute, Elizabeth 
Noelle-Neumann, cited the unusual relationship to work as one of the common 
elements bonding the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the growing disorder of his own surroundings, a Soviet foreign affairs 
adviser and Germany expert, Vyacheslav Dashichev, sat in his modest Moscow 
office, rejected the notion of national character, but then almost wistfully 
reeled off a string of adjectives he associated with Germans -- "knowledgeable, 
diligent, hard-working, disciplined, conscientious, responsible, punctual." 
</P>
<P>
Added Paul Percie du Sert, commercial director of France's Renault Corp., "The 
principal quality of the Germans is their sense of organization. We have 
learned a lot from our contact with them." 
</P>
<P>
This curious German yearning for order and implicit acceptance of the rules 
needed to enforce it may have been diluted by 40 years of freewheeling 
democracy, but these traits still strike outsiders as unusually strong. 
</P>
<P>
How else can one explain the well-dressed Berlin woman standing stoically in a 
downpour at a traffic light, waiting patiently for green, even though there are 
no cars in sight? Or the shout of reproach at the foreigner who dares consider 
his options and cross on red? Or the intolerant scream from a cyclist in Berlin 
as he passes a Polish shopper, laden with freshly purchased goods, who has 
inadvertently strayed into the bicycle lane? 
</P>
<P>
In modern Germany, a fine-tuned, seemingly infinite set of petty laws still set 
the rhythm of life within carefully erected bureaucratic boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The government decides when a person can cut his lawn, beat a carpet, when he 
can begin clearing his sidewalk of snow and when he must finish. It even 
intrudes in such intimate personal choices as the naming of a newborn child. 
</P>
<P>
A Frankfurt couple several years ago were blocked by a court from naming their 
newborn after Schroeder, a character in the "Peanuts" cartoon strip, because 
the name was not on a government-approved list. 
</P>
<P>
"Names help create a certain order," explained a local government bureaucrat at 
the time. "If a name is on a list and nobody knows if it's a man or woman, then 
difficulties can arise." 
</P>
<P>
After obtaining the required government -- yes, government -- permission to 
hook up a telephone answering machine, customers get a two-page written 
statement from the telephone authorities laying out exactly what is and what is 
not permitted on the recorded message. (The words "automatic answering 
machine," for example, must be used, while a closing statement is also required 
(although the wording "thank you," while officially recommended, is optional). 
</P>
<P>
Germans also seem to feel a special need for enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
An American who inadvertently parked in a West Berlin apartment house driveway 
recently found that residents had not only called the police but had also 
surrounded the vehicle to prevent any premature escape by the offender. 
</P>
<P>
Following a lengthy discussion about the similarities between the Dutch and the 
Germans, Henk van Dijk, a historian at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, noted 
one glaring difference: Unlike the Dutch, he said, the Germans lack any 
inherent mistrust of state authority. 
</P>
<P>
The close link between individual and state is steeped in Prussian tradition, 
he explained, and was a jumping-off point for German philosophers such as 
Friedrich Hegel in developing the idea that the whole of a state is greater 
than the sum of its individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"The state has always taken care of people; they expect it," noted Ralf 
Dahrendorf, German-born warden of Oxford University's St. Antony's College and 
a respected social scientist. "Germany is the exact opposite of the United 
States, which began as a very different society where it was hard to find a 
government at all." 
</P>
<P>
While the undertone of intolerance and inflexibility inherent in such order is 
something that worries both Germans and outsiders as the country confronts its 
new challenges, there is a widespread conviction that the exposure to Western 
values, and the high degree of Germany's economic, social and political 
integration among Western nations, collectively provide an important damping 
effect on the German national mood. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see all the 'buts,' but you need to take the long view, I am confident 
about Germany's future," said Dahrendorf. "If there is ever a country that has 
really changed, it is West Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Germany today are totally different that the people I witnessed 
here as a young man," noted Ernst Cramer, the 77-year-old deputy supervisory 
board chairman of Germany's Axel Springer publishing empire, a Jew who survived 
Buchenwald. "Younger people are outward-looking, exposed to all sorts of ideas, 
and react to events in the same way as someone in London, Paris or Los Angeles. 
After the last war, we've created an internationally minded society." 
</P>
<P>
Commented Juergen Kocka, a historian at Berlin's Free University: "The question 
now is what unity means. Will it modify or relativize this deep break (from the 
past)? After all, we are getting 16 million who have had six decades of 
dictatorship without a democratic role model. 
</P>
<P>
"West Germany had become a 'post-Sonderweg' Germany," he added, using the word 
that has come to denote Germany's "special way," the political path that has 
led it to such tragedy in the past. "Now we are getting a new mix. There is a 
certain uncertainty, but I'm optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
For outside observers, the future level of anxiety about the Germans is 
expected to turn largely on two key issues: 
</P>
<P>
* How Germany's highly prosperous western half revives and integrates an 
outmoded East German economy and absorbs an additional 16 million souls who 
have no collective democratic experience. 
</P>
<P>
* How strong a united Germany's commitment remains both to the dream of an 
economic and political union among the 12-nation European Community and to its 
three pivotal European bilateral relationships with France, Poland and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
European worries about the depth of this commitment were initially eased by 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's forceful reaffirmation of faith in the 
idea of European unity twice in the months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
and by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's oft-stated goal of building a 
"European Germany rather than a German Europe." 
</P>
<P>
However, recent developments have brought questions. 
</P>
<P>
Both the tone and content of Kohl's refusal to go along with French President 
Francois Mitterrand's request at a Franco-German summit last month in Munich to 
pin down the timing of European economic and monetary union, coupled with 
recent cautionary comments by Federal Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl on 
the same issue, have brought tugs of doubt in Brussels, but so far no panic. 
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling is the German commitment is still there," said Stanley 
Crossick, a respected, Brussels-based political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The Munich performance reflects both a personal chill between Kohl and 
Mitterrand and the tough French adjustment that unification has meant for a 
Franco-German relationship that is central to the drive for greater European 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
Germany's ties with both the Soviet Union and Poland, on the other hand, seem 
rich in potential, and there are signs that economic necessity may help 
overcome the suspicions of the past. It was a senior Soviet official who 
recently proposed that Germany should be the sixth permanent member of the U.N. 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's Soviet-German friendship treaty left relations between Europe's 
two largest nations better than at any time in memory, while Warsaw still 
struggles to overcome a visceral nervousness that has come with unity. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the Solidarity Weekly recently, writer Jan Rylukowski urged Poles to 
break "the psychological barriers" against cooperation with Germany, arguing 
that Poland's links to Western Europe begin with the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
For many, however, it is the problems of East Germany that represent the real 
test of the health and spirit of the newly united country. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans, who have built their prosperity on hard work and well-proven 
conservative policies, must for the first time venture into the economic 
unknown to do something no one has ever done: rebuild a Communist economy. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's downward spiral threatens to throw as many as 4 million out of 
work -- a full quarter of the population -- sap the morale of the entire region 
and spawn a discontent that could test the stability and fabric of German 
democracy to new limits. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who fear that if East Germans, who already feel that the 
political left has failed them, suddenly see themselves equally let down by a 
democratic free-market system, they might seek refuge in the extreme right. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans find themselves tested in other ways, such as in the delicate task 
of knitting together two German peoples who at times seem to have more traits 
that separate them than they have in common. 
</P>
<P>
In what is more of a West German takeover of the east than a genuine merger, 
the spirit of unification could be influenced by the westerners' ability to 
restrain a victor's mentality so visible in many of their initial contacts with 
the east. 
</P>
<P>
The way in which many West Germans have pursued property claims in the east or 
the offhand remark by Dionys Jobst, chairman of the West German Parliament's 
transportation commission, that all East German drivers need to go back to 
driving school are only two such examples. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the West German public seems preoccupied with the costs, not the 
potential benefits, of unity. 
</P>
<P>
Respected West German newspaper columnist Herbert Kremp recently described his 
countrymen's equivocal commitment to rescue their East German cousins from 
economic collapse as akin to passengers on a luxury liner who, when forced to 
stop for a capsized ship, "lean over the rail to take part in rescuing the 
survivors, but at the same time admonish the captain not to get so close that 
he brings his own ship in danger and that, above all, he quickly continues the 
cruise." 
</P>
<P>
This sense of detachment may be depressing for those in search of a greater 
national spirit and generosity, but it is cited by many as a positive sign -- 
one more bit of proof that the romantic lure of a German Sonderweg is weak, if 
not altogether dead. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's democracy certainly has a good track record. 
</P>
<P>
With six chancellors in 41 years, it has been a model of stability. 
</P>
<P>
Highly controversial decisions have been accepted and absorbed, creating a 
political continuity that has been so successful that much of it is now largely 
taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Schmidt, the chancellor whose thinking led to the Pershing missile 
deployment in the early 1980s, voted against German rearmament in 1955. The 
party led for many years by Foreign Minister Genscher, arguably Germany's most 
visible Europeanist, voted against German entry to the European Community in 
1958, while Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats vehemently opposed West 
Germany's rapprochement with Eastern Europe in the early 1970s, a rapprochement 
he now proudly claims as the basis for Germany's new relationship with the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
Surviving the student revolution of the 1960s, the terrorist campaigns of the 
1970s and the peace movement in the early 1980s all reinforced Germany's 
democratic process, adding to its sense of self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, the twinge of doubt remains. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a fool would not be concerned," Springer executive Cramer told an 
American acquaintance who asked how Jews should react to German unity. "But I 
don't believe you have to worry." 
</P>
<P>
A strong proponent of Germany unity, French political figure Veil paused when 
asked the ultimate question: Is the monster that was Germany dead? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope so," she replied. "I hope so."

in order to ensure its security. This is an important point. Tell me, in 10 
years who will be the master of the Kremlin? Is it always going to be a 
reasonable person like Gorbachev? That's why I think we should give Germany 
nuclear weapons. I regret that Germany doesn't have nuclear weapons. It's

that. When she sees Germans, she still feels uncomfortable, and I think some of 
that has rubbed off on me. It is difficult to describe, but the feeling is 
definitely there. It is an uneasy feeling to watch Germany today. German 
fascism grew out of poverty and chaos, and that's East Germany today. That's 
where the skinheads are now -- in East Berlin. We must never forget what 
happened to people so systematically."

"I understand the feelings, especially those of our smaller neighbors who've 
had bad experiences with Germany in the course of their history. There's always 
uncertainty at turning points, and feelings about the future are determined 
much more by the memories of the past than by some clear vision of what will 
happen. But the future also depends on our neighbors. It is possible to have a 
united Europe that gives a much more stable political framework to overcome 
some national weakness. Even if the emotional situation in Germany might lead 
to a certain instability -- then it's much better to handle this inside (an 
integrated) Europe than outside. What's the answer if it is not Europe? What 
else can give the assurances they seek?

"People in France, Britain, the Netherlands and Poland fear first and foremost

remedy is the European (unity) framework; that will reduce the dangers to a

Twice they've failed. The second time ended in a national catastrophe. I think 
in the consciousness of the people, these failures have left them wiser in the 
conviction that they try a third time to go this way, it can promise only a 
failure far greater than in World War I of World War II. This time it can lead 
to the annihilation of a nation.

<P>
In an early-morning raid today, Anaheim police arrested at least five suspected 
gang members whom they believe nearly beat to death a man trying to retrieve a 
bicycle that was stolen from his 12-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Police, armed with search warrants, converged on seven houses looking for 
suspects in the Sept. 24 attack on Jose I. Perez, 38, of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
During the raid, police seized baseball bats and clubs believed to have been 
used in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Also confiscated were loaded firearms, apparently blood-stained clothing and a 
bicycle that matches the description of the one stolen from Perez's son, Jorge, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Names, ages of and charges against those arrested were not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the attack, Perez went to recover his son's bike that was stolen 
at the George Washington Community Center in Anaheim. Upon getting out of his 
car, Perez was confronted by 10 to 12 gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang members chased Perez for a couple of blocks before catching him and 
beating him with baseball bats, clubs and possibly metal pipes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez remains in a local hospital in good condition recovering from multiple 
injuries.

SENATE ENDORSES BUSH MOVES TO HALT IRAQ;

GULF CRISIS: OPPONENTS SEE THE 'SIGNAL OF UNITY' AS A POTENTIAL 'BLANK CHECK'

<P>
The Senate today endorsed President Bush's efforts to "deter Iraqi aggression" 
despite some members' concerns that the resolution could be seen as giving Bush 
broad authority to wage war. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution of support passed 96 to 3. It followed an overwhelming House 
vote Monday expressing similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"This resolution is not an authorization for the use of force, now or in the 
future," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) told his colleagues 
before the vote. "This resolution is not a blank check." 
</P>
<P>
Senators voting on the prevailing side said they believed it was important to 
send a signal of unity around the world by giving legislative support to Bush's 
moves so far. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) joined Sens. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) and Mark O. 
Hatfield (R-Ore.) in voting against the resolution. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) 
was not present. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy called the language of the resolution "a blank-check endorsement for 
future actions" that abdicates Congress' power to declare war. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States put on a show of strength in the Persian Gulf 
today, sending an aircraft carrier into the dangerous waters for the first time 
in 16 years and staging a 15,000-Marine mock amphibious assault. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time today, France used naval firepower to help enforce the 
U.N. trade embargo against Iraq. The warship Doudart de Lagree fired warning 
shots to halt a North Korean freighter near Djibouti in the Bab al Mandab 
strait, which links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. 
</P>
<P>
French military officials said the freighter, the Sam Il Po, had defied an 
order to stop for inspection. The vessel was searched and then released when it 
did not appear to be violating the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The movement into the gulf of the carrier Independence was disclosed by the 
Pentagon only one day after Bush, in remarks to the United Nations, offered new 
optimism that the crisis with Iraq could be settled without war. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not conflicting signals," Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said. 
"Things like exercises . . . are what you do to keep up the readiness of your 
forces." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said at a Pentagon briefing that the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade 
-- a force of 15,000 Marines, mostly from Camp Lejeune, N.C. -- was staging 
amphibious landings on a remote beach in the northern Arabian Sea.

Women who took at least two alcoholic drinks a day were three times more likely 
than abstainers to die before age 65, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was nearly twofold for men in the study, which was based on a 
national sample of people who died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For women, 40.7% of so-called heavier drinkers died before age 65 versus 13.2% 
of abstainers. For men, the figures were 42.3% versus 22.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Even people classified as moderate or light drinkers showed higher death rates 
than the abstainers. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers cannot be interpreted as indicating risks of early death because of 
the way the study was done, cautioned co-author Darryl Bertolucci. 
</P>
<P>
The study began with people who were already dead, and it worked backward to 
classify them according to their drinking habits, rather than starting with 
people of known habits and following them to find their risk of early death.

An unruly mob today broke down police barricades and stormed the courtroom 
where ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was to stand trial for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people, including policemen and journalists, were injured in the 
stampede, apparently aimed at delaying the court proceedings until after the 
Oct. 24 parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police, armed with steel-tipped batons and automatic rifles stood 
by, prohibited by law from using force around the Punjab High Court. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, pale and visibly shaken by the outburst, waited with her lawyers and 
bodyguards in a room adjacent to the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
After more than two hours of pandemonium, Justice Rashid Aziz Khan adjourned 
the hearing until Oct. 9, the day Bhutto is to stand trial before him on 
another corruption charge. 
</P>
<P>
Police blamed Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party for the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawyers accused police commandos of triggering the violence to deliberately 
discredit the former prime minister and her party. The party seems to be 
gaining strength since the army-backed caretaker government resurrected the 
one-judge special tribunals to try members of Bhutto's ousted government for 
corruption.

At least three people were killed and 10 wounded today when police opened fire 
on demonstrators protesting the Indian government's plan to increase the number 
of its jobs reserved for low-caste Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the dead were demonstrators and one was a police officer who died in the 
hospital after "hooligans fired on the police," a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Policeman Ajay Chadha said his men were forced to open fire after 
running out of tear gas when about 80 of them were surrounded near Parliament 
by a 5,000-strong mob wielding heavy sticks and throwing stones. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd became totally unmanageable and we had to open fire," he said after 
a rally that took place on the birthday of the late Mohandas K. Gandhi, the 
advocate of nonviolence who led India to independence in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Serious unrest began as people drifted away from the rally against Prime 
Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh's plan to increase government jobs reserved 
for lower castes, outcastes and tribal people from 22.5% to nearly half. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, officials said a paramilitary patrol responded to a grenade attack 
in Kashmir by burning 400 houses and firing on villagers, killing at least 17 
people and leaving hundreds missing. 
</P>
<P>
Many victims were dragged from their homes and shot at close range, and others 
died in the fire that gutted the densely populated market area, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Monday in Handwara, an apple-trading town 50 miles from 
the northern Jammu-Kashmir state capital, Srinagar. 
</P>
<P>
Phansung, a town official who uses one name, said seven of the dead were buried 
today. Other officials said the smoldering debris of the buildings had not been 
searched, and the death toll was expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the fire started after Muslim militants hurled a grenade at 
Border Security Force troops patrolling the town market.

Conservative Zulu leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi has refused to meet Nelson 
Mandela to discuss ways to end savage factional fighting that has claimed 
hundreds of lives, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress said Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Party, 
declined an invitation to attend a meeting Friday of black homeland leaders at 
Mandela's home in Soweto outside Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
"The ANC would have preferred if Mr. Buthelezi would have attended the 
consultative meeting on Friday," said ANC spokesman Abba Omar. 
</P>
<P>
ANC officials said they hoped Buthelezi's refusal to attend the meeting would 
not derail efforts to end fighting between the two groups.

Muscovites say they will go on eating Big Macs, even at double the price. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course the food is very expensive for us, but where else can we get a 
hamburger that tastes like this?" asked Elena Dachenko, as she munched a 
cheeseburger today. 
</P>
<P>
"This restaurant has so much culture," said Katya Zavapovskaya. "I'll probably 
continue eating here even though the prices are higher." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's doubled its prices Monday, making the capital's first American-style 
fast-food restaurant unaffordable for many. 
</P>
<P>
But most customers lining up to enter McDonald's today in a steady drizzle 
appeared unaware of the increases, announced in the newspaper Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
A Big Mac hamburger has soared to about $12 at the official exchange rate. A 
double cheeseburger now costs $9.60. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Winer, general director of McDonald's in Moscow, said the restaurant was 
forced to raise prices to compensate for increased costs of meat and vegetable 
oil. "It was a painful decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Pushkin Square restaurant opened in January, it has served about 
50,000 customers a day.

PepsiCo Inc. said today it has bought more than 70% of Empresas Gamesa for 
about $300 million, giving the big U.S. beverage and snack foods firm a 
majority stake in Mexico's largest cookie manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition is PepsiCo's second-largest international food acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
It ranks behind the 1989 purchase of two British snack chip makers, Smiths 
Crisps and Walkers Crisps, for $1.35 billion from the French company BSN. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican snack food subsidiary of PepsiCo, Sabritas SA de CV, made the 
acquisition by buying more than 70% of the outstanding stock of Empresas 
Gamesa, which is a holding company that owns 68% of Grupo Gamesa, Mexico's 
major cookie company. The shares of Empresas Gamesa stock not bought by PepsiCo 
are publicly held.

SALES OF NEW HOMES SLUMP 1.4% IN AUGUST; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE SIXTH DECLINE IN EIGHT MONTHS IS SEEN AS MORE EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS 
IN THE INDUSTRY.

<P>
Sales of new homes slumped 1.4% in August, the government reported today. It 
was the sixth decline in eight months and more evidence of weakness in the 
housing industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said new-home sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 550,000 after edging down a revised 0.2% in July. The July fall, 
however, was much softer than the 2.3% first reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, sales during the first eight months of the year have plunged 
13.6% below the same period of 1989. Many analysts expect sales to remain weak 
because of high mortgage rates, consumer caution over adverse economic news and 
the Persian Gulf crisis and, in some areas, a glutted market. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates fell to 9.84% during the first week in August, but they began 
spiraling after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and ended the month at 
10.24%. They remained at 10.22% at the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
The weak sales have contributed to sluggishness in the construction industry. 
The Commerce Department reported Monday that overall spending was unchanged in 
August while residential spending fell 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of less-expensive existing homes, on the other hand, have been moving up 
for three months, including a 2.1% advance in August, according to surveys by 
the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the median price of a new home edged up 0.2%, to 
$120,200, in August. The realtors said the median price of an existing home was 
$97,000. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less. 
</P>
<P>
The department also said inventories of new homes showed a 7.7-month backlog at 
the August sales pace, unchanged from July. 
</P>
<P>
The West posted the only increase in sales -- up 0.7%, to 139,000 units, after 
falling 3.5% a month earlier.

Two lots of a prescription antihistamine are being recalled because the 
packages may contain a blood pressure medication, the Food and Drug 
Administration said today. 
</P>
<P>
The antihistamine is Bioline-brand hydroxyzine pamoate in 50 mg capsules. 
</P>
<P>
The blood pressure medication, 0.2 mg clonidine hydrochloride, comes in scored, 
peach-colored tablets, with a "dp" logo above the score-line and "02" below the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
If a consumer finds that a bottle that is supposed to contain the Bioline 
capsules instead contains the tablets, they should return it to the pharmacy 
where they got it, the FDA advised. 
</P>
<P>
Someone who takes the blood pressure drug in the amounts directed for the 
antihistamine could become dizzy and fall, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Both drugs are made by Duramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cincinnati. Labels are 
supplied by the distributor, Bioline Laboratories of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.

What do you give a left-handed person who has nearly everything? A left-handed 
checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
Australia's Bank of Melbourne has started issuing left-handed checkbooks, the 
bank's chief executive said today. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Stewart estimated that about 30% of the bank's 800,000 customers 
are left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I saw my No. 2 man, who is left-handed, trying to sign a check. It was 
clumsy," Stewart said. "The next week we got a letter from a left-handed 
customer complaining about the checkbooks so we decided to do something about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The difference between a right-handed and left-handed book is that a 
left-handed book's spine is on the right.

General Electric Co. said today it expects to put 450 to 500 hourly workers at 
its major appliance manufacturing complex here on indefinite layoff by the end 
of the year due to a softening economy. 
</P>
<P>
The company cited declines in both the U.S. housing market and consumer 
confidence for cuts in the production of washing machines and driers, 
refrigerators, dishwashers and stoves. 
</P>
<P>
"That downward trend is affecting our entire industry. The industry is down 3% 
to 5% this year and we're projecting a 3% to 5% decrease in 1991," said GE 
spokeswoman Laurie Simon. 
</P>
<P>
The indefinite layoffs represent a 6% cutback in the hourly work force at the 
Louisville complex, which employs 9,000.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said today it cannot explain the recent plunge in 
its stock price, which has wiped about $515 million off its market value in the 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Company secretary Keith Brodie said the global media group believes the 
Australian stock market is "fully informed on all material matters concerning 
the company." 
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange had queried News Corp. about the sharp slide in its share 
price to $5.41 Monday from $7.50 on Sept. 24. News Corp. shares bounced up 
today to close 60 cents higher at $5.91. 
</P>
<P>
No public statements were made that might affect the share price other than 
Murdoch's widely reported comments at an investment conference in New York last 
week, Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch said he is concerned about the group's high level of short-term debt 
and will seek to reduce it through increased earnings in the next two to four 
years.

More and more Japanese -- whose legendary capacity for hard work is the 
backbone of a buoyant economy -- would rather have more free time than more pay 
if given the choice, according to a government survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
About 57% of those polled said they would prefer more leisure time to a pay 
raise, a 4% increase over a 1989 poll, the prime minister's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Just 22% said they would take a higher salary at the expense of leisure time, 
the lowest on record since the government initiated the poll in 1975.

SUNS OFFER MINIMUM TO NO. 1 DRAFT PICK

The Phoenix Suns announced today they have decided to offer first-round draft 
pick Jayson Williams only a one-year contract for the minimum $170,000 salary 
and he likely won't be on their NBA roster this season. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a forward from St. John's, returned to his home in New York and was 
not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"His options are many," Suns President Jerry Colangelo said at a news 
conference. "He's welcome to come to training camp (starting Friday in 
Flagstaff). I don't think that's in the cards. No. 2, he can sit out the entire 
year and go back in the next college draft and we will retain his rights until 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 3, he can go to Europe and play and we would still retain his rights. And 
No. 4, we could trade his rights. If anyone's interested, they can call." 
</P>
<P>
Colangelo said he and Suns head Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons met with Williams last 
Thursday and the rookie told them he'd rather play for an East Coast team. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix drafted the 6-foot-10, 240-pound Williams at No. 21 overall in the June 
27 draft although he missed all but 13 games of his senior season last year 
with a fractured bone in his right foot. It was surgically repaired in January 
but he hasn't played a game since Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Williams angered Suns officials when he skipped the team's rookie and free 
agent camp here in July, saying he wouldn't be ready to play until Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 31, Williams' agent, Bob Woolf, informed Colangelo that his client was 
considering signing a one-year, $1.5-million contract with the Italian pro team 
Il Messaggero. That deal never materialized and Williams joined the Suns for 
informal workouts Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"Jayson had to demonstrate to us with his work ethic and attitude that he 
wanted to be a member of the Phoenix Suns. The bottom line is we didn't see 
that," Colangelo said.

Nolan Ryan isn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan wants to keep the ball used in his final career strikeout. So he arranged 
to have 11 balls thrown out of his last start last Sunday, just in case the 
Rangers don't sign him for next year. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan announced last month that he plans to return to pitch for the Texas 
Rangers next year. But the Rangers, who hold a $3.3-million option on his 
contract for 1991, haven't spoken to him since to indicate that they want him 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he arranged with plate umpire Ted Hendry to have the final ball from 
each Ryan strikeout removed from play. 
</P>
<P>
"In case I don't come back, I wanted to make sure I had the ball from Sunday. 
You never know what's going to happen. I can't predict the future." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Tom Grieve told the Dallas Morning News that exercising the 
option was "a mere formality." He said he expects the club to make it official 
before the deadline of 15 days after the season ends.

Loy Vaught, the 13th player taken in the latest NBA draft, signed a reported 
$4-million, 4-year contract with the Los Angeles Clippers today. 
</P>
<P>
Vaught, a 6-foot-9 power forward out of the University of Michigan, was the 
second of two first-round picks by the Clippers in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
They took Bo Kimble, the former Loyola Marymount star, with the No. 8 pick. 
Kimble remains unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited to be a Clipper," Vaught said. "This team has so much talent 
and potential." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very ecstatic to have him in training camp," said Mike Schuler, the 
Clippers' new coach. "It can be such a big advantage for a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tremendous young man and we expect him to make a contribution right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers open training camp Friday at nearby Cal Poly Pomona.

STYNE NOT RESTING ON HIS LAURELS

Jule Styne's life would make a great big Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 5 in 1910, Styne leaped on stage to sing a ditty with music hall 
star Sir Harry Lauder. 
</P>
<P>
By 9, he was a piano prodigy who performed with the Detroit and Chicago 
symphonies. By his teens and 20s, he was leading a band that featured Benny 
Goodman, was writing special material for Sophie Tucker and was playing piano 
for Fanny Brice. 
</P>
<P>
In his 30s, he was a Hollywood voice coach for stars ranging from Shirley 
Temple to the Ritz Brothers, was scoring B movies and writing hit songs for 
films and Tin Pan Alley. 
</P>
<P>
In his 40s, he was just beginning his career as a Broadway composer. 
</P>
<P>
And what a career: "High Button Shoes," "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," "Peter 
Pan," "Gypsy," "Funny Girl" and "Bells Are Ringing." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I ever did in my life came back to me in one way or another," he 
said recently during an interview from his spacious Fifth Avenue apartment 
overlooking Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
At 84, Styne is a man in good health and good spirits who has a lot of good 
projects ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Styne said that he is looking forward to receiving Kennedy Center Honors in 
December with Katharine Hepburn and three others for lifetime achievement in 
the cultural arts. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not simply taking in awards these days. Styne said a revival of 
"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is in the works "for Madonna and what's-her-name, 
the brunette, the crazy broad, she's wonderful -- Cher. They're talking about 
it, but you have to get them both together at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
And Jerome Robbins recently called Styne to write a ballet for a workshop 
production. There is also a videocassette version of the current revival of 
"Gypsy" being planned for when the show ends its Broadway run. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest project, however, is a new Broadway musical based on the film "The 
Red Shoes," with a book by Ken Ludwig ("Lend Me a Tenor") and lyrics by Barbara 
Schottenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
Styne's family emigrated from England to Chicago in 1913, and his natural 
talent for the piano was recognized. Scholarships to music schools followed. 
But a drill-press accident desensitized one of his fingers, and Styne lost the 
ability to become a great classical pianist. So he downshifted his goals to 
popular music. 
</P>
<P>
As Styne's career as a songwriter grew, he realized he wanted to write for the 
stage, where he would have control over his work. 
</P>
<P>
Styne's first attempt at a Broadway show was 1944's "Glad to See You!" directed 
by Busby Berkeley. But, he says, the show was a "catastrophic show for all 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Styne's second show, however, was a big hit: 1947's "High Button Shoes" 
starring Nanette Fabray and Phil Silvers, directed by George Abbott and 
choreographed by Jerome Robbins, who would go on to create some of his best 
work with Styne in "Peter Pan," 'Bells Are Ringing," "Gypsy" and "Funny Girl." 
</P>
<P>
With a revue in 1951 called "Two on the Aisle," starring Bert Lahr and Dolores 
Gray, Styne began his professional relationship with lyricists Betty Comden and 
Adolph Green. 
</P>
<P>
"They were kind of sophisticated," Styne said. "A lot of lyric writers I was 
writing with couldn't spell. It was a step up in class for me." 
</P>
<P>
Did the duo outnumber him? 
</P>
<P>
"I outnumbered them," he said, chuckling. "I outnumber everybody. I'm difficult 
to work with -- like Jerome Robbins. All I want it to be is right. That's not 
asking much."

DIVORCED FROM TOM CRUISE? DON'T ASK MIMI ROGERS

Actress Mimi Rogers is so busy she doesn't even know if her divorce from Tom 
Cruise has been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, we're divorced, but I've been so busy on this new film that 
I haven't had time to check, so I'm not sure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet that sounds pretty silly, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
The actress put her personal life on hold while she worked in the desert from 
early morning to late at night on her new film "The Rapture," in which she 
plays a woman facing the end of the world. 
</P>
<P>
She also appears in Oliver Stone's "The Doors" and stars opposite Mickey Rourke 
in the thriller "Desperate Hours," which opens this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Michael Cimino film is a remake of the 1955 Humphrey Bogart movie "The 
Desperate Hours," which is about an escaped felon who takes a family hostage in 
their suburban home. Rogers plays the woman whose house is invaded.

NBC newswoman Jane Pauley, who has interviewed hundreds of celebrities, says 
she's still waiting to land an elusive scoop: her husband, Garry Trudeau. 
</P>
<P>
"I have thought about asking him," Pauley said, "but A, he would never do it, 
and B, I would not ultimately do it. 
</P>
<P>
But I know it's a neat story." 
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, celebrates "Doonesbury's" 20th 
anniversary this month. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the Oct. 8 issue of People magazine, Pauley said Trudeau 
believes that "the more high profile you become, the more you have to maintain 
it. And you have to adjust your life for updates, just to keep everyone aware, 
which is time consuming." 
</P>
<P>
But Pauley said someone should persuade Trudeau to do an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be me, but I'm just going to be really irritated if it turns 
up on somebody else's network."

Sir David Lean, the 82-year-old director whose films have won 27 Academy 
Awards, is planning to marry for the sixth time, his lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lean will wed 51-year-old interior designer Sandra Cooke before Christmas, said 
attorney Michael Gee. 
</P>
<P>
The couple met five years ago in the frozen-food section of Harrods department 
store, where Cooke went up to Lean and asked when his next film was due, said 
Daily Mail columnist Nigel Dempster. 
</P>
<P>
Lean and Cooke are vacationing in France, Gee said. The director's next film 
project will be an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel "Nostromo." 
</P>
<P>
Lean is the director of such classics as "The Bridge on the River Kwai," 
"Lawrence of Arabia" and "Great Expectations."
