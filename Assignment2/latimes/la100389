NEWSMAKERS: IT WAS 4 FOR TEA -- FOR 4 MONTHS

What began as a pleasure cruise of Pacific islands turned into a long ordeal 
for an American and three New Zealanders as they spent nearly four months 
adrift aboard their overturned boat, police in New Zealand said. The three New 
Zealanders -- skipper John Glennie, 48, Phillip Hoffman, 41, and Rick 
Hellriegel, 31 -- told their story to reporters in Auckland. The American crew 
member, Jim Nalepka, 38, did not speak at the news conference. The four men 
drifted ashore on New Zealand's Great Barrier Island late Sunday. Their 
trimaran, a craft with three parallel hulls, capsized June 4 in high seas about 
140 miles off New Zealand, they said. Coast Guard officials said that apart 
from loss of weight, all four were in good physical condition. "We had a lot of 
food in the boat and we rigged up a plastic sheet to catch rainwater. We were 
able to have cups of tea in the mornings," Glennie told reporters. The men 
built a platform above the water level to form a cave-like shelter under the 
cockpit -- but living in such close quarters took a toll. "I don't really care 
if I don't see the other three again, ever, but I suppose that feeling will 
pass," Glennie said.

 -- Jim Robinson has also made a journey of sorts -- from homelessness to a new 
home and a new job. Three weeks ago, Robinson, 42, was an unwelcome intruder in 
a Miss America contestants' photo session. The discovery of Robinson and 
another homeless man beneath an overturned lifeguard boat interrupted the Sept. 
9 beach photo session at Atlantic City, N.J., and an Associated Press 
photographer captured the scene as police hustled them away. A day after that 
incident, Robinson's colleague, Jeff Hall, was found dead on the beach (the 
cause has not been determined). Robinson said Hall's death inspired him to try 
to turn around his own life. He has moved in with a cousin in Bogota, N.J., and 
is working in the mail room at Penguin USA, a publishing company in 
Bergenfield, N.J.

 -- Cowboy singer and actor Rex Allen, 68, is going to have a place to hang his 
hat -- and the rest of his wardrobe, movie posters, silver saddle, record 
jackets, comic books and other mementos -- in his hometown of Willcox, Ariz. 
The Rex Allen Arizona Cowboy Museum will open during the 38th annual Rex Allen 
Days, Saturday and Sunday. Exhibits will touch on local history in addition to 
Allen's life -- from his youth in the southeastern Arizona town through his 
singing and movie days and his numerous narrations for Disney "World of Color" 
TV specials. SHIRLEY MARLOW

EDMOND DE SZIGETHY; MARRIED TO GABOR TRIO'S MOTHER, JOLIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edmond de Szigethy, described by his stepdaughter Zsa Zsa Gabor as a one-time 
Hungarian Freedom Fighter who married her mother Jolie Gabor in what proved to 
be "one of the great love affairs of all time," died over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor, awaiting sentencing on charges of slapping a Beverly Hills 
police officer, driving without a valid driver's license and possessing an open 
flask in her Rolls-Royce, said Monday that De Szigethy had a heart attack and 
died Saturday in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
He was "76 or 75," she said, and had broken a hip in a car accident a few weeks 
ago. He was believed to have been recovering from the hip injury and a heart 
attack that followed the accident when he had a second seizure. 
</P>
<P>
When De Szigethy married Jolie Gabor, now 91, in March, 1957, in New York, he 
was described as a Hungarian count who had resisted the Communist takeover of 
Hungary in 1954. He was Jolie Gabor's third husband, and they had known each 
other in Budapest years earlier and renewed their friendship after meeting 
again in this country. 
</P>
<P>
He operated his wife's jewelry salon in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Jolie Gabor's other daughters are Magda and Eva.

WILLIAM FAIRBANK, 72; STANFORD EXPERT ON SUPERCONDUCTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Fairbank, whose work in low-temperature superconductivity laid the 
foundation for hundreds of scientific experiments worldwide, has died. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank, professor emeritus of physics at Stanford University, suffered a 
heart attack Saturday while jogging near the Palo Alto campus, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank researched the nature of superconductivity and participated in the 
search for gravity waves, subatomic particles called quarks, and monopoles, 
believed to be a component of magnetism. 
</P>
<P>
His work is the basis of a multimillion-dollar project to test a final unproven 
prediction of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank, who worked in his lab the night before his death, believed in what he 
called the "Anti-Murphy Law of Physics." This held that when one understands an 
experimental situation correctly, three or four things come together to make 
the impossible possible. 
</P>
<P>
He performed his first superconductivity experiment in 1947 with his brother 
Henry, also a physicist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laser Advancement 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank's work centered on the ability of some materials to offer no 
resistance to an electrical current if they are cooled to near absolute zero. 
Stanford said Fairbank's influence on physics included the development at 
Stanford of the superconducting accelerator in which a linear accelerator is 
cooled to 2 degrees above absolute zero. The superconductivity allows for 
greater degrees of sensitivity and led to the first demonstration of a free 
electron laser. 
</P>
<P>
His research often led into other areas. In 1975 he developed a machine in an 
experimental program that killed cancer cells without damage to organs or 
tissue. Designed for use on cancers of the mouth and throat and certain brain 
and lung tumors, the "Medical Pion Generator" used a stream of pions -- 
subatomic particles generated by a high-energy accelerator -- to kill the cells 
with minute nuclear explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank was born in Minneapolis, graduated from Whitman College in Washington 
and earned his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Stanford in 1959, he taught at the University of Washington, 
Amherst College and Duke University and worked on the staff of the Radiation 
Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

CATASTROPHIC CARE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your extensive article on the catastrophic care bill was complete, thorough and 
objective (Part I, Sept. 24). We all believe in the purposes of this 
legislation, but what is now frustrating seniors is the failure of our Congress 
to address valid criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
I recently attended a meeting of the Aging Commissions of the county. Contrary 
to Sen. David Pryor's (D-Ark.) comments that "they don't understand the 
benefits they are going to have," each of the more than 200 present knew every 
benefit in minute detail. Unlike Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) and Rep. Pete 
Stark (D-Oakland) who allege the outcries come from a few wealthy, greedy 
people, these were normal, good people who have saved a few dollars and know 
fairness when they see it. 
</P>
<P>
And they recognize that when Congress recites the support of the American Assn. 
of Retired Persons, this is a biased group, self-interested, whose support is 
not representative of the majority of its members. 
</P>
<P>
As with the recent pay raise issue, the public is again speaking, loud and 
clear. It is democracy at work. The need for such grass-roots involvement 
reflects poorly, however, on the present state of our representative form of 
government.

FOR REDRESS AT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will the redress that has for so long been denied those Japanese Americans who 
were locked up by the government during World War II at last be granted? The 
chances of that seem better now, after the Senate's vote to guarantee a 
three-year program of compensation to the surviving internees. The Senate's 
plan to provide the first $500 million late next year of an earlier-authorized 
$1.2 billion still has to be reconciled with a House bill that provides only 
$50 million for the fiscal year that began this week. 
</P>
<P>
House conferees are likely to plead revenue shortages to justify their 
tight-fisted approach. But as Sen. Warren Rudman (R.-N.H.) reminded his 
colleagues the other day, there are times when what is fiscally desirable is 
less compelling than what is morally right. This is one of those times. 
</P>
<P>
About 117,000 Japanese Americans -- two-thirds of them U.S. citizens -- were 
taken from their homes in the western states in early 1942, forced to dispose 
of their property at below-market prices and put behind barbed wire in remote 
and inhospitable areas. This gross violation of an entire community's civil 
liberties arose from war-in- duced hysteria fanned by decades of regional 
racism. It was and remains significant that in Hawaii, home to tens of 
thousands of ethnic Japanese, no internments took place and no incidents 
occurred. It is no less significant that 17,600 young men, 10% of the interned 
population, volunteered for military duty. Most served with the Army's 442nd 
Regimental Combat Team, which fought bravely, suffered high casualties, and 
emerged as the most decorated American unit of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Congress authorized paying each surviving internee an admittedly 
symbolic $20,000. Only now with the Senate's action, however, is Congress 
moving to appropriate the necessary funds. That process won't be completed 
until the House agrees with the Senate's guarantee of scheduled compensation 
payments. Meanwhile, the ranks of those entitled to redress are being 
inexorably thinned. 
</P>
<P>
The House measure directs the first payments to the oldest among the survivors. 
That should be done. But the most urgent need is for Congress finally to 
appropriate all the money required so that an enduring and shameful wrong may 
be at least partially set right.

CATASTROPHIC CARE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a senior citizen in affluent Orange County, I am aware that I am in a 
distinct minority when I say that I favor the catastrophic health care bill and 
would like to see it retained. My lonely voice is all but drowned out by the 
shrill cries of outrage by those who feel that it is unfair to ask them to help 
pay for their own care. 
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens with resources requiring the payment of income taxes are not 
living in poverty. That is doubly true for those whose bill would reach the 
maximum of $800. With the increasing cost of medical care, a prolonged illness 
could make serious inroads on the resources of even those resources. It seems 
reasonable to me that we should be willing to pay when we are able rather than 
leaving a continuing increase of deficit spending for our grandchildren to pay 
at a time when there will be a much smaller ratio of contributors to 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that many high resource seniors may not benefit from catastrophic 
care provisions as they have other coverage. They can depend upon that 
particular bete noire of the self-anointed consumer protectors (read: Harvey 
Rosenfield) -- the insurance companies. But what about the millions of those 
who do not have and cannot afford that luxury? Prior to becoming eligible for 
Medicare, private medical insurance through group rates was costing me in 
excess of $200 per month and rising each year. I was still required to pay 20% 
of medical costs after an annual deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) cites 3,000 letters with not one 
supporting catastrophic care. I question his statement as he had at least one 
of support. Perhaps he just does not read his mail. I wrote urging him to 
support retention; I received a response assuring me that he fully supported by 
views and that he would work diligently for repeal. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the solution to the controversy is to make the Medicare program as it 
now stands a continuing benefit, and make it voluntary. You buy in or you don't 
with no selection of separate parts.

His words "rapacious" and rapacity refer more to his own twisted concepts than

survived have received little pay or acknowledgment. We have paid our taxes, 
apparent and hidden, for generations.

<P>
Inflation has overtaken our fixed incomes. Now it takes a month's income just 
to pay our car insurance. We have stood uprightly for our families and our

APPLAUSE FOR STATE AIDS PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three-year strategic plan to deal with AIDS in California validates the 
wisdom of the Deukmejian Administration in establishing the State AIDS 
Leadership Commission. It is this commission which drew up the document that 
provides a summation of the best professional thinking for addressing the 
pandemic and making the most effective use of the funds and facilities 
available. 
</P>
<P>
There are no surprises. The commission has drawn together programs already in 
operation and concepts already generally accepted among the professionals. The 
thoroughness of the 136-page report in bringing this material together is part 
of its value. 
</P>
<P>
Only in its timing is it disappointing. The state Legislature had requested the 
report by April 1, so that it could be a more forceful part of this year's 
legislative consideration of matters related to the epidemic of the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Some of the findings were 
brought out in March in legislative hearings, however; so the report's impact 
can already be measured in some of the constructive bills already voted. What 
matters more is that the report will be in place to serve as a foundation for 
planning over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Some people have been disappointed that there are no price tags attached. We 
think the commission was correct in resisting making this a budget document. 
Its usefulness is in establishing principles for the programs that each year 
will be adopted and adapted. 
</P>
<P>
The single most important thought of the report, in terms of dollars and cents, 
is this: "The individual, social and economic costs of the HIV epidemic are 
already high, but the costs of not aggressively combating the epidemic now will 
be higher. The advantages of responding to this highly fatal, communicable 
disease now, instead of later, must be recognized and acted on." That means 
that California, which is already spending more than any other state, will need 
to spend even more if it is to escape an even greater burden later. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dozen priority recommendations are two that have not yet been 
implemented in the state. We share the belief of the commission that they 
should be acted on promptly. First, there is the need for legislation that 
would permit a controlled investigation of the effectiveness of exchanging 
clean needles for contaminated needles among intravenous drug users. The 
drug-addicted population now has the highest infection rate and, for Los 
Angeles County, is the group most at risk. We need look no further than New 
York City, where the public health system is overwhelmed with AIDS cases among 
intravenous drug users, to grasp the importance of contriving effective 
programs to reduce the spread of HIV in this group. The other area of weakness 
in existing programs is reaching minorities, now suffering an infection rate 
disproportionate to their population numbers. "Community-based and culturally 
sensitive HIV disease prevention programs should be implemented in racial and 
ethnic minority communities throughout the state," according to the report. It 
urges a greater role by minorities in program development. 
</P>
<P>
The report reaffirms the major policies in place. It supports voluntary 
testing, opposes mandatory HIV screening, advocates broad protection against 
discrimination, and, crucially important, it argues for strengthening AIDS 
education, the only way to curb the pandemic in the absence of any known cure. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is not merely a state government proposal, but is intended to guide 
the response at every level in California, according to the preface by the 
commission co-chairmen, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the state Department 
of Health Services, and Dr. Marcus A. Conant, a San Francisco physician and 
AIDS authority. 
</P>
<P>
"To be effective, our approach to the HIV epidemic cannot separated from other 
modern-day epidemics such as drug abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, and 
teen-age pregnancy," they argue. It is cogent advice. Indeed, the report's 
breadth can usefully spur the state's response to these other terrible 
problems, closely interwoven as they are.

FOCUS ON SENDING SOVIET JEWS TO ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABRAHAM H. FOXMAN, Abraham Foxman is national director of the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memories of the Holocaust years have played a significant role in so much of 
the activity of the organized Jewish community in America. In particular, we 
know that we cannot afford ever again to be silent, that we have to resolutely 
act to protect endangered Jews anywhere in the world and to work actively on 
behalf of the security of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Once in a while, however, the lessons of the Holocaust years are misread (I say 
this as a refugee who, with his parents, survived the Holocaust). Such is the 
case in the recent disputes surrounding the destination of Soviet Jewish 
emigres, in particular the new U.S. regulations that limit emigration to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
While there is much important debate on the specifics of any given proposal 
regarding Soviet Jews, underlying some of the talk is the notion that this 
time, American Jews must make sure that the gates of America are open to all 
Jews who want to come here. We all recall that during the 1930s and '40s those 
gates were closed, and the feeling exists in some circles that if American Jews 
had done more to pry them open, the tragedy of the Holocaust might have been 
mitigated. 
</P>
<P>
But there is little parallel between then and now, primarily because when the 
Nazis were annihilating European Jewry, America was really the last best hope 
to save large numbers of Jews. Today, that is not the case at all. 
</P>
<P>
The place that offers not only the chance but the guarantee of haven is Israel. 
The issue today is not that a tragedy for Soviet Jews could occur because no 
one would admit them. Israel's doors have always been open to all Jews. 
</P>
<P>
For American Jewry, the challenge has been for Soviet Jews to gain the right to 
leave. That has been the focal point of the activities of the National 
Conference on Soviet Jewry and other organizations such as the Anti-Defamation 
League that have worked tirelessly -- and successfully -- through political and 
public channels to keep pressure on the Soviets to allow Jews to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
If there were no Israel, it would be the obligation of the Jewish community to 
do everything in its power, no matter the difficulties, to see to it that as 
many Soviet Jews as possible could come here. Since Israel exists, other 
factors must be taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
First, we would like Soviet Jews to have a choice of where to go. That is why 
we agree that direct visas either to Israel or to the United States should be 
issued in Moscow. For many Soviet Jews, it now means the choice of obtaining a 
visa immediately to go to Israel or waiting, perhaps for a very long time, for 
a visa to the United States. The key factor is that they may decide for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Second, one cannot afford to ignore the existence of many other refugee groups 
around the world seeking to come to the United States, some of them in dire 
straits with other shores of refuge closed to them. 
</P>
<P>
What is right here, morally and politically? What are our obligations as 
concerned Jews and as humanitarians? 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy answers, but clearly an approach is called for that still 
provides for admission of significant numbers of Soviet Jewish refugees to the 
United States, while recognizing that there are other needs and limited funds. 
</P>
<P>
Our other obligation is toward Israel. It has been said again and again how 
important substantial Soviet Jewish immigration -- aliyah -- is to Israel. If, 
somehow, it was a choice between saving Jewish lives or supporting Israel, then 
there would be reasons to give precedence to lives. That is clearly not the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, our primary obligation is to focus our energies on how to encourage 
as many Soviet Jews as possible to go to Israel. By working toward that end -- 
through financial assistance and a balanced approach to the refugee issue in 
the U.S. Congress -- we will be able to look back with pride on our role as 
American Jews. For we will have helped achieve our two main goals -- freedom 
for Soviet Jews and the strengthening of the state of Israel.

PERSIAN GULF HAS THE WEST BY THE JUGULAR NO LONGER

<P>
The general public should be forgiven for not giving much thought these days to 
President Jimmy Carter's statement in his 1980 State of the Union address, 
popularly labeled the "Carter Doctrine": 
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region 
will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States and 
such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military 
force." 
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq war is over, the Ayatollah Khomeini is dead, the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has long lost its sting and the Soviets 
have withdrawn from Afghanistan and show no sign, if they ever did, of making a 
grab for Iranian or Saudi oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the doctrine lives on, with a whole industry of scholars, soldiers and 
policy-makers supporting it, doctored into longevity by Ronald Reagan's sharp 
buildup of American naval and air power. And President Bush's propensity to let 
sleeping dogs lie keep's the doctrine's life-spirit intact. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion has already absorbed the more benign atmosphere, but top 
policy-makers appear to be failing to acknowledge not just the changed Soviet 
attitude but the equally profound changes in the power of the oil industry and 
of Islamic fundamentalism. This is extraordinarily intellectually silly, not to 
say costly to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
The policy-makers need to be confronted with a few hard facts: 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf, and in particular the infamous Strait of Hormuz, the narrow 
waterway that is its entrance, is no longer the "jugular" of the Western 
economies. The rapid construction of overland pipelines is reducing its 
importance by the day. Besides, as the Iran-Iraq war revealed, it was not 
feasible to block the strait by sinking ships in its entrance. Its waters run 
too deep and its currents are too strong. Moreover, the war showed that large 
modern-day tankers are not especially vulnerable targets. Their very size makes 
them difficult to sink and crude oil is not particularly flammable. It's 
nothing more than a myth that shipping got through during the war because of 
the presence of American, British, French and Dutch naval forces. Attacks on 
shipping actually increased by 60% in the year following the beginning of naval 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
The oil market has totally changed since the huge price rises of 1973 and '79. 
Indeed, so slack is the market that the Iran-Iraq war made no notable impact on 
oil prices, even though insurance rates rose sharply for ships transiting the 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC no longer has the power to play on Western fears about oil prices. And 
nothing in its achievements suggests it ever should have been otherwise. The 
price hikes of '73 and '79 certainly happened, but we now know they were 
accelerated and exaggerated by a speculative panic concerning future supplies. 
The OPEC countries themselves have learned that they are as much the losers 
when they help push the Western economies into recession. 
</P>
<P>
Certain oil gurus earned large consulting fees predicting that oil prices were 
unlikely to come down and that the dependence on Persian Gulf oil would 
continue indefinitely. In fact, in real terms, oil prices are not much 
different from what they were before the price rises, and by 1985 dependence on 
the Gulf nations' oil could not have been more different than it was in 1980. 
The United States was down from 30% to 7% of all oil imports, Western Europe 
from 60% to 35% and Japan from 70% to 59%. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation, more technologically proficient extraction policies, new 
discoveries and the substitution of other energy sources were the successful 
legacy of the price antics of '73 and '79. 
</P>
<P>
The third leg of the oil threat has been the long-held belief that Moscow has a 
greedy strategic eye on the oil-producing states. The invasion of Afghanistan 
rang the alarm bells, convincing many that it was the first step in a long-term 
Soviet drive to the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But as Prof. Robert Johnson argues in a long and thoughtful analysis in the 
current issue of Harvard's International Security, this is simply not true. 
"The Soviets must assume the Iranians would resist any military advance. And 
they've been reminded in Afghanistan that local forces operating in mountainous 
terrain can put up a very considerable resistance." 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that the Soviets could take power through "invitations" from local 
regimes. Yet experience has shown that radical regimes in the Middle East 
usually repress local Communist parties, are highly nationalistic and may be 
Islamic-fundamentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Even before perestroika, it was never very clear why the Soviets would want to 
take these kinds of risks. In the late 1970s, the CIA argued that Soviet oil 
production was about to go into rapid decline and the Soviets would have to 
look elsewhere for oil. The decline has not happened, and the Soviet Union 
remains the world's largest oil producer. 
</P>
<P>
The final argument for Western worriers has been the view that Iranian 
fundamentalism might come to dominate a significant part of the Gulf. But if 
Iran failed with Iraq, which has the Arab world's largest Shiite community and 
therefore the one most sensitive to Khomeini's brand of Islamic fervor, the 
chance of success elsewhere is, to say the least, unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The Carter Doctrine was born of anxiety and hyped by panic. Calmer times now 
suggest that it be quietly buried -- the deeper into the Arabian sands the 
better.

PLANTING SEEDS FOR A WATER HARVEST; 
</P>
<P>
WRONG ALLIANCES LEAVING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGH AND DRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC REISNER, Marc Reisner is an environmental writer and author of Cadillac 
Desert, a history of water in the West (Penguin, 1987).

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles may be the only great metropolitan region in the world that is 
gaining people and losing water at the same time. That would be a devastating 
turn of events anywhere. It is doubly devastating here, in the largest and 
richest desert metropolis on earth, a semi-arid basin that must import most of 
its water from hundreds of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the Southland's dilemma is that much of its recent growth has been 
based on borrowed or wished-for water supplies, while an abundant and nearby 
source has been rendered invisible by politics. 
</P>
<P>
The borrowed water belongs to Arizona and Mono Lake. With the completion of the 
Central Arizona Project, the Metropolitan Water District ultimately may have to 
give up to Arizona enough Colorado River water for 3 million people's use. And 
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power faces the loss of tens of 
thousands of acre-feet from the streams feeding Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The wished-for water belongs, at least in a geographic sense, to Northern 
California. Ever since the State Water Project was launched in the 1960s, the 
MWD has assumed that a virtually limitless supply of new water could be tapped 
from the north. But the voters' extraordinary defeat of the Peripheral Canal in 
1982 showed that Northern Californians are almost unanimously opposed to 
letting more water flow south. And a lot of Southern Californians seem 
unwilling to pay for giant new hydrologic wonderworks. Meanwhile, the San 
Francisco Bay/Delta hearings, now being conducted under the auspices of the 
State Water Resources Control Board, may establish that too much fresh water is 
already being diverted from this great, priceless estuary. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, these developments have thrown the Metropolitan Water Distirct into 
a state of near-apoplexy and rekindled hostilities between the "selfish" urban 
north and the "gluttonous" urban south. Yet neither side seems to be paying 
much attention to the agricultural sector, which diverts 85% of California's 
developed water supply. 
</P>
<P>
In a rural state such as New Mexico, letting agriculture divert 8 1/2 of every 
10 acre-feet of the available water might make minimal sense. But California 
now has more people living in urban areas than any other state and most of our 
wealth is generated in the cities rather than on the farms. Today, California's 
$16 billion in gross agricultural output represents just 2 1/2% of the state 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say we should sacrifice agriculture on the altar of urban growth. 
California's farm industry is by far the most valuable and diversified in the 
nation. It is absolutely vital to the rural regions of our state. The state's 
growers must be protected against ravenous land development and the loss of 
their essential water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Essential is the operative word. What, after all, constitutes waste? How about 
a California rice crop that consumes as much water as three cities the size of 
Los Angeles -- water that is, in large measure, subsidized by the taxpayers 
even as we subsidize the rice crop itself. (Rice has been a designated 
"surplus" crop for many years.) What about irrigated grass for livestock, a 
$94-million crop that uses as much water as the urban Southland and Bay Area 
combined? 
</P>
<P>
The four biggest water users in California are not cities but (in order of 
consumption) irrigated pasture, alfalfa, cotton and rice. Except perhaps for 
cotton, these are all low-value, surplus, or water-demanding crops -- sometimes 
all three. Much of the irrigation water they receive is federally subsidized, 
sold by the Bureau of Reclamation for about one-tenth its real worth. If just 
these four crops -- forget all the others -- could get by on 25% less water, 
there would be enough, in theory, to satisfy projected urban growth for a 
couple of decades without building new dams. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't the farmers use less? Partly because it is cheaper to waste 
subsidized water than to conserve it. Partly because the doctrine of Western 
water law says "use it or lose it." (California has modified its water code so 
that farmers who save water don't automatically lose it to the next 
appropriator, but a lot of growers seem unaware of this supremely significant 
fact.) Partly because the rural regions of the state are terrified of being 
devoured by the cities. 
</P>
<P>
How do we get out of this dilemma? The Metropolitan Water District recently 
negotiated a historic water conservation and transfer arrangement with the 
Imperial Irrigation District, through which the MWD will pay for 
super-efficient irrigation methods and then buy the water Imperial no longer 
needs. A savings of 100,000 acre-feet is all but guaranteed; a savings of 
420,000 acre-feet is within the realm of possibility, without retiring an acre 
of land. 
</P>
<P>
This is the all-carrot and no-stick approach that's been successfully used by 
California's utilities to curb electricity consumption. There is no obvious 
reason why it couldn't solve our water dilemma, too. Oddly, however, 
Metropolitan has not even begun to negotiate with the growers in the state's 
agricultural bastion, the Central Valley, where water that would supply a 100 
million urban users is poured on crops every year. Some of this land should 
never have been brought into production in the first place; it is plagued by 
selenium and poor drainage, which have brought on a mounting environmental 
catastrophe. Would Central Valley agriculture really suffer if urban 
Californians financed state of-the-art irrigation efficiency (which can be 
expensive to install and operate) and bought the water the farmers no longer 
need? If we paid the growers handsomely to retire a few hundred-thousand acres 
of marginal land? 
</P>
<P>
One reason, undoubtedly, for the MWD's timidity with the San Joaquin growers is 
its secret hope that, in the future, the agricultural water lobby will help 
push through a Peripheral Canal initiative. But since two of the biggest San 
Joaquin growers helped defeat the 1982 initiative (they thought it was ridden 
with environmental safeguards), that is a very long shot. 
</P>
<P>
A water alliance that makes perfect sense today would join urban California, 
north and south, in a campaign to reduce agriculture's intolerable consumption 
of scarce water. But who is willing to predict that the urban south and the 
urban north will ever be on the same side in a water war?

"NBC Nightly News" is experimenting with ways to improve the mix and pace of 
stories in the nightly newscast. News executives have been looking at various 
sample versions of a newscast that would include re-edited versions of pieces 
that have appeared on "Nightly News." Some stories have been shortened, while 
other investigative pieces have been lengthened in the experimental versions. 
"This is normal fine-tuning," says executive producer Bill Wheatley. "There are 
no radical changes afoot." With increased competition from other TV news 
sources, the three network newscasts in recent years have been promoting 
issue-oriented series on suchsubjects as the environment, drugs and education. 
Although "Nightly News" recently ranked No. 2 in the nightly news ratings, it 
has been in third place against newscasts on ABC and CBS. NBC has been No. 1 in 
prime time for many months. ALEENE MacMINN

Grant Tinker, whose winning ways have soured somewhat since he left the 
chairmanship of NBC three years ago, took another blow Monday when former 
"Entertainment Tonight" producer Jim Bellows sued Tinker's GTG East 
Productions, Inc. for $1.8 million in the Southern District federal court of 
New York. The breach of contract action accuses the Tinker-Gannett television 
operation, best known for its syndicated "USA Today" newsmagazine, of failing 
to honor Bellows' contract to develop a new half-hour celebrity-centered 
program tentatively titled "Star Tracks." According to Bellows' attorney, 
Michael Zweig, a pilot for the new program, cast in the "Entertainment Tonight" 
mold, is still being developed by GTG under the new name of "Celebrity" but 
without Bellows. ALEENE MacMINN

Box-office receipts for the nation's Top-5 films dropped 21% from last weekend, 
as Tri-Star's new release "Johnny Handsome" failed to attract big audiences. 
The Mickey Rourke thriller debuted on 812 screens for $2.4 million, a 
per-screen average of $3,002. Paramount's "Black Rain" grossed $6.5 million, 
falling 33% since its smash opening, to lead the box office for the second 
weekend in a row. Universal's "Sea of Love" remained in the No. 2 spot, 
recording tickets sales of $6.1 million -- a strong $4,655 per screen -- and 
increasing its total take to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Columbia's "Welcome Home" joined Warners' "In Country" this weekend as the 
second post-Vietnam drama in three weeks. "Welcome Home," directed by the late 
Franklin Schaffner and starring Kris Kristofferson, received a cool reception 
on 192 screens, grossing $442,240 for a per-screen average of just $2,303. 
Director Norman Jewison's "In Country," starring Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd, 
expanded from 4 to 606 screens and took in $1.4 million.

TEXAS SCHOOL FUNDING RULED UNLAWFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Texas Supreme Court found "glaring disparities" between the state's rich 
and poor school districts and ruled that funding within the nation's 
second-largest system is unconstitutional. Spending varies by as much as 
$17,000 per pupil per year from rich to poor districts, the court found. The 
9-0 ruling could have enormous financial and social implications for the 
3.3-million-student Texas school system. The court found that the public school 
finance system violates the 113-year-old constitutional provision for an 
"efficient system" of public schools. It set a May 1, 1990, deadline for 
legislators to find a solution. The court said the state's school financing 
system is efficient neither financially nor in the sense of providing for a 
"general diffusion of knowledge." Public schools are funded largely through a 
combination of local property taxes and state aid.

Pope John Paul II and Robert A. K. Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury, pledged in 
a declaration at the Vatican to work toward the reunification of the Roman 
Catholic and Anglican churches. Runcie said again that his call for papal 
primacy in any reunified church concerns only "spiritual leadership" and is 
"not intended to have constitutional or political implications."

In a major policy reversal, Britain's opposition Labor Party dropped its 
once-cherished policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. At its annual 
conference, the party voted to adopt a new platform that would commit a Labor 
government to scrapping Britain's nuclear weapons only in a negotiated arms 
deal. Ditching the non-nuclear doctrine, a factor in Labor's successive defeats 
by Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher since the party lost power in 
1979, is part of a major policy overhaul.

Nineteen more names of dead American servicemen will be added to the Vietnam 
War Memorial, raising the total number on the wall to 58,175, the National Park 
Service announced. The 19 were either overlooked or were determined to meet new 
criteria for having their names placed on the wall, a park service spokesman 
said. Flight crew members involved in combat missions who died "out of the 
combat zone" or in accidental crashes are being added to the wall in the 
changes, the spokesman said. In addition to the 19, another 48 names on the 
wall are being re-inscribed because spelling errors were found or objections 
were raised due to other mistakes, the spokesman said.

The U.S. Court of Appeals reopened to the public the Washington, D.C., cocaine 
conspiracy trial of alleged drug boss Rayful Edmond III and 10 associates, 
blocking an order by the trial judge barring the public's attendance, the 
Washington Post reported. In overturning the apparently unprecedented order by 
U.S. District Judge Charles Richey, the three-member appellate panel wrote that 
Richey had failed to show that the threat of danger to the jurors that he cited 
in his order outweighed the defendants' constitutional right to a public trial. 
The appellate court, however, said it was not precluding Richey from taking 
less restrictive measures to protect the anonymity of the jury.

The House approved a 4.9% cost-of-living increase in benefits for about 2.5 
million disabled veterans and their survivors. The increase, effective Dec. 1, 
would raise from $1,468 to $1,539 a month the basic benefit payment for a 
veteran with 100% disability resulting from service in the military. Maximum 
monthly benefits would rise from $2,559 to $2,684 under the legislation, which 
was approved without opposition on a voice vote. The package also orders the 
Army to set aside an area at Arlington National Cemetery for the unmarked 
burial of cremated remains. Also approved was an extension of Vietnam-era GI 
Bill education benefits to 1977 and 1978 graduates of the military academies 
and 1978 graduates of Reserve Officer Training Corps programs.

KEY VOTE ON CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS BILL DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House faces a showdown vote today on the 1988 catastrophic illness 
insurance law. The law's author, Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), predicted that 
lawmakers would vote to abolish the controversial income-based supplemental 
premium that was to have funded many additional benefits in the biggest 
expansion of Medicare since its inception in 1966. Stark, who drew up the 
Catastrophic Health Insurance Act, plans to push an amendment to maintain some 
of the law's benefits. Some senior citizen groups, some House Democrats and 
most House Republicans support repeal of the law. "It's going to be a very 
close vote" between repeal or scaling back the program, Stark said. House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) accused President Bush of not doing enough to 
persuade House Republicans to back the Administration position against repeal.

Leftist Peruvian guerrillas exploded 12 bombs and launched attacks that left 
seven people, including three police officers, dead near a resort where a 
summit meeting of Latin American leaders takes place next week, officials said. 
Police blamed Maoist guerrillas of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) movement 
for the attack on Palpa, about 50 miles from the resort of Ica. Rebels also 
killed the acting mayor of the northern provincial capital of Huamachuco as he 
stood in front of his home, police said. In another attack, seven police 
officers and four other people were wounded in a market in the capital, Lima. 
Sendero has killed about 20 mayors throughout Peru since late May in an effort 
to frighten people out of running for office in November elections.

HONEYMOON KILLER GETS LIFE SENTENCE; 
</P>
<P>
PENALTY FOR MURDER OF WIFE ON CRUISE SHIP EXCEEDS GUIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual move, a federal judge in Los Angeles on Monday sentenced a Santa 
Monica chiropractor to life in prison for strangling his wife and throwing her 
overboard on the last night of their honeymoon cruise to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the cruelest murders I've ever seen," said U.S. District Judge 
James A. Ideman in explaining why he levied upon Scott Roston a stiffer 
sentence for second-degree murder than called for by the federal sentencing 
guidelines or a 30-year term requested by a federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Ideman said that under federal guidelines, a stiffer sentence could be levied 
against a defendant if circumstances warrant it. 
</P>
<P>
Roston, 37, did not visibly react when Ideman pronounced the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Sophie Roston, and Roberta Seaquist of Lantana, Fla., the mother of 
his dead wife -- seated on opposite sides of the courtroom -- burst into tears 
when Ideman said, "I'm going to impose life imprisonment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Court System Does Work' 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Seaquist issued a statement saying she was "thankful" that Roston 
was given a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I am sad about what happened to my daughter, Karen, I am pleased 
to see that the court system does work," Seaquist said. 
</P>
<P>
As he was leaving the Courthouse, Roston's father, Si Roston, said only: "Our 
son is innocent. He will be appealing the conviction." 
</P>
<P>
Roston was convicted by a jury of second-degree murder last March after a 
three-week trial. Normally, murder cases are tried in state court, but this 
case was brought by federal prosecutors under a law that provides that murders 
committed on the high seas are federal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Roston, 26, was murdered on Feb. 13, 1988, on the final night of a cruise 
from San Pedro to Mexico on a ship called the Stardancer. 
</P>
<P>
Roston told the ship's crew that his wife had been swept overboard by a strong 
gust of wind. 
</P>
<P>
The crew became suspicious because they noticed that Roston had scratches on 
his face and that he went to a bathroom and tried to clean himself up but did 
not use any of the other facilities in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claimed He Was Framed 
</P>
<P>
Roston later claimed that Israeli agents drugged him and framed him for the 
murder because of a 1987 book he authored titled "Nightmare in Israel." In the 
book, Roston alleged that he had been arrested on false burglary charges in 
Israel and abused in a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors attacked that contention as absurd. 
</P>
<P>
They said Roston beat and strangled his bride on the jogging track of the 
cruise ship after a series of arguments and threw her overboard from the 11th 
deck of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
The defense presented no witnesses during the trial, but did introduce a 
passenger list of those aboard the Stardancer cruise, which included the names 
of two Israeli nationals who had booked passage. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men later testified that he was merely on vacation and not connected 
with the Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal sentencing guidelines, Roston, in theory, faced 11 to 14 years in 
prison for second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Ideman, however, cited two appendixes to the guidelines that allow judges to 
impose harsher sentences for "loss of life" or "if the defendant's conduct was 
unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the victim." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Adelson, one of Roston's lawyers, made a lengthy argument Monday on why 
his client should not receive a stiff sentence. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Ideman interrupted him, saying, "What is perfectly clear is he 
intended for Karen Roston to die." 
</P>
<P>
But the defendant's mother declared from her seat in the courtroom, "No, he 
didn't!" 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Kendra McNally, who prosecuted the case, said the sentence 
was "legally correct and factually justified." 
</P>
<P>
In her argument, McNally said, "The murderer sits in this courtroom 
unrepentant," a reference to the fact that Roston has maintained that he 
committed no crime. 
</P>
<P>
McNally noted that Roston took 11 1/2 steps from the jogging track to the 
ship's railing, where he threw his wife's body over the side. The prosecutor 
said that showed that the crimes were not done in a sudden act of rage. 
</P>
<P>
Roston's lawyer, Adelson, said he will appeal.

ABORTION PROTEST CASES MAY SWAMP COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the next several months, the Los Angeles Municipal Court will become a 
legal battlefield where religious convictions and the law clash head-on in 
about 50 trials involving anti-abortion activists. 
</P>
<P>
During this wave of prosecutions, legal experts say the court system itself 
will be tested as it struggles with the expenses and logistics of prosecuting 
more than 800 activists on trespassing charges. 
</P>
<P>
The cases stem from blockades at two women's clinics last spring orchestrated 
by the controversial anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials said the trials could each take an estimated four weeks to 
complete and cost taxpayers a total of $15 million in court costs. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial -- the longest-running 
criminal proceeding in history -- has cost about the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
The number of defendants involved in the abortion protest cases is so unwieldy 
that the four deputy city attorneys who will prosecute them hope to try the 
defendants in groups of 20 to expedite the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is not alone in grappling with Operation Rescue prosecutions. In 
the last 18 months, an estimated 28,000 to 35,000 anti-abortion militants have 
been arrested during more than 150 clinic blockades in a political and moral 
war being fought in the streets and -- increasingly -- in the courtrooms of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group, whose goal is to overturn federal statutes permitting 
abortions, have found that they can effectively use the courts as a pulpit for 
their cause. In short, they demand trials. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue attorneys say that their cause is more important than the 
financial impact of the prosecutions on the court system. 
</P>
<P>
"For me personally, I can't put a dollar value on the life of one single unborn 
baby," said Cyrus Zal, general counsel for Operation Rescue. "If there are 
people who want to equate human life with dollars, then they should be asked 
how much money they would accept to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that through these trials," Zal added, "the public will be educated to 
the truth of abortion." 
</P>
<P>
But Paul Shechtman, a prosecutor in New York City, where more than 500 people 
have been arrested in the last several months, said the cases are a 
"significant problem." 
</P>
<P>
"These are clearly committed people," he said. "They are careful not to break 
up property or harm anyone, but what they don't realize is the costs are 
enormous to taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, prosecutions will undoubtedly intensify, with pro-choice 
and anti-abortion groups planning major rallies in many cities. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen protests are planned for Southern California in the next few months, 
Operation Rescue leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, tens of thousands of anti-abortion and pro-choice activists will 
descend on Washington for a major confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting ready. There will be extra manpower. We will do what has to be 
done," said Sgt. Ronald Evans, a spokesman for the special operations division 
of the Washington Metropolitan Police. 
</P>
<P>
The response Operation Rescue has received from authorities has varied from 
city to city. In some, they hold "get-tough" mass court hearings. In others, 
they do everything they can to avoid trials, including changing laws so that 
anti-abortion protesters receive only citations. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, for example, police arrested 1,276 people during Operation Rescue 
demonstrations in front of abortion clinics during the 1988 Democratic National 
Convention and in the months that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors there have vowed to treat each case seriously, and officials 
estimate their costs, as a result, are running into the millions. The 
arraignments alone cost $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city even held preliminary hearings in a large warehouse at the local 
fairgrounds in order to keep the "criminal justice system from breaking down," 
said Raines Carter, Atlanta's chief prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"When we found out it was psychological warfare to clog the courts, we adopted 
a different strategy to get them through court as fast as we could," Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue's charismatic leader, Randall Terry, was found guilty last 
week of criminal trespass and unlawful assembly in the Atlanta case and is 
awaiting sentencing. The prosecutor has asked for the maximum sentence of two 
years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Many other cities, meanwhile, have chosen not to prosecute, fearing that their 
court systems would be clogged by such cases. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, Santa Clara County officials declared a "judicial 
emergency" when faced with the prosecution of 500 defendants. The action gave 
prosecutors more time to prepare and conduct the trials. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't sure we would be able to do it," Santa Clara County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Rebecca Hayworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Within three months, the prosecution had completed seven jury trials with 23 
defendants. As a result of many convictions, other protesters awaiting trials 
chose to enter pleas. 
</P>
<P>
"They began to sense that we were serious about trying them, and started to 
plead out in great numbers," Hayworth said. 
</P>
<P>
After another San Francisco Bay-area blockade this year, Contra Costa County 
prosecutors avoided numerous trials by identifying the leaders of the protest 
through photographs and then going after them. As a result, only 10 of the 100 
people arrested went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"If we did a hundred at a time, it would have clogged the courts," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Dodie Katague said. "What these group trials do is turn it into a circus 
and take the focus away from the issue of individual responsibility for the 
person charged with trespassing." 
</P>
<P>
And in Redwood City, officials became so concerned about upcoming 
demonstrations that they enacted an ordinance that made unlawful blockades an 
infraction instead of a misdemeanor, thus precluding trials. 
</P>
<P>
"We had seen the chaos caused in neighboring counties and didn't want that to 
happen here," City Atty. David E. Schricker said. When a major blockade took 
place in June, 138 people were arrested, pleaded "no contest" and were fined. 
</P>
<P>
A few budget-conscious cities and police agencies have sued Operation Rescue, 
trying to recoup their costs. 
</P>
<P>
In Brookline, Mass., where two of the three city prosecutors have been faced 
with cases generated by several anti-abortion protests, the city filed a 
federal suit to recover at least $250,000 in damages. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, however, the city attorney's office declined to file a similar 
suit requested by Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, because prosecutors want to 
pursue different legal avenues regarding the cost issue. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sobel, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles 
who has taken Operation Rescue to court to prevent clinic blockades, noted that 
there is legal precedent in California not to recover money from protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel said San Luis Obispo County once filed suit against the anti-nuclear 
group Abalone Alliance to recover costs of prosecuting people who protested the 
operation of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeals ruled that even though an act of civil disobedience 
is unlawful, society shares the burden of paying for police protection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the the cost of having the First Amendment," Sobel said. "Even if the 
conduct of the demonstrators isn't lawful, it doesn't change the fact that 
there are elements of free-speech activity there." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue protesters do not necessarily care how much the trials are 
costing. Instead, they are using the cases to draw attention to their cause 
and, in the process, have won some key court skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue officials estimate that nationally they have a 40% acquittal rate. 
</P>
<P>
They said their victories, such as the recent acquittal of Terry in Los 
Angeles, have also encouraged more anti-abortionists to risk arrest. 
</P>
<P>
It was that case that has fired the fears of court officials. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Terry and the defendants dragged out the proceedings for 
almost five weeks by courtroom drama that included bowing their heads in prayer 
and crying on the witness stand. At times, the defendants placed Bibles on the 
defense table. They referred to fetuses as "children" and abortion clinics as 
"killing centers." Pro-choice activists were labeled "murderers," prosecutors 
"anti-Christian bigots" and judges "lap dogs of the death industry." 
</P>
<P>
Several times, a furious Municipal Judge Richard Paez stomped off the bench 
when his admonitions to curtail such tactics were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Terry and four others were acquitted of trespassing charges in that case. 
However, the jury was deadlocked on the question of criminal conspiracy, and a 
mistrial was declared. On Monday, Paez granted the city attorney's motion to 
retry Terry and two co-defendants Dec. 4 on the conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
While many judges, including Paez, have threatened Operation Rescue attorneys 
with contempt, few have followed through because it is a very involved legal 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"The criminal justice system only works if everybody plays by the rules, and 
Operation Rescue is committed not to play by the rules," said Maureen Siegel, 
the city attorney's acting chief of criminal operations. 
</P>
<P>
But Zal defended the courtroom theatrics. 
</P>
<P>
"You are going to get convicted unless you do something drastic," he said. "I 
trust in the Lord, whatever he wants me to do. I feel the Holy Spirit guiding 
me in the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
Zal and other Operation Rescue attorneys have been conducting seminars to 
instruct the activists on how to represent themselves in court. 
</P>
<P>
In Central California, Kings County Justice Court Judge Martin Suits said: 
"Traditionally, the courts have been used as a forum for exercise of (free) 
speech rights, but I can't think of any that where there has been such an 
obvious, obstructionist attempt to backlog courts." 
</P>
<P>
Suits said he threw out one impaneled jury earlier this year in an abortion 
clinic blockade case because he believed that the jurors were "tainted by 
bizarre antics of the defense." 
</P>
<P>
"I would ask the defense not to ask certain questions, and they would ask it 
anyway," Suits recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"After five days of jury selection it became apparent that the jurors were 
offended, that they could not give them a fair trial," he said. "At one point, 
the jurors actually began hissing at the Operation Rescue defense attorney. I 
couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the extensive courtroom theatrics that Operation Rescue employs, Los 
Angeles prosecutors are gearing up for more of the same when the 50 new trials 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
"If their intention was to shut down the criminal justice system in L.A., they 
are not going to succeed," vowed prosecutor Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
The 535 defendants who were arrested during a blockade of the Family Planning 
Associates Clinic on Westmoreland Avenue will be given trial dates in December. 
The 280 protesters arrested at Midland Medical Clinic on West Washington 
Boulevard will be given trial dates in January. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Municipal Judge Larry P. Fidler said he is prepared to ask for more 
judges from other counties, if necessary, to hear the trials. 
</P>
<P>
"We can hold them anywhere in the county," he said, "(even) hire a hall, we 
have authority to do so."

HIGH COURT TO HEAR APPEAL OF CRIME FUND FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear arguments in a case that 
originated in San Diego challenging the constitutionality of a law requiring 
people convicted of federal crimes to pay "assessments" to a special crime 
victims fund. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Clarke, an attorney with Federal Defenders, challenged the law as 
unconstitutional in 1985, when her client pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor 
counts of alien smuggling and paid a $50 assessment. The assessments, which 
range from $25 to $200 per offense, are authorized by the Victims of Crime Act 
of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1985 case, German Munoz Flores was placed on two years' probation after 
he pleaded guilty to alien smuggling. Munoz, 35, lives in Los Angeles and has 
completed his probation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Origin 
</P>
<P>
Clarke argued at the time that the assessments were unconstitutional because 
they stem from a revenue-raising measure that originated in the Senate, instead 
of the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution requires that all revenue-raising bills must originate in the 
House of Representatives. The theory behind this was that the House is more 
representative of the people," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke argued this unsuccessfully when Munoz was sentenced by a federal 
magistrate. She lost an appeal in U.S. District Court but won in the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court struck down the assessment law as 
unconstitutional in December, 1988, and ruled that it was a revenue-raising law 
that had incorrectly originated in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, federal courts in the 9th Circuit have not been accepting the 
special assessment. The appellate court's ruling is binding in Arizona, Alaska, 
California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fee is still being collected in other federal jurisdictions. The 
2nd, 3rd and 6th circuit courts have turned down challenges to the law and 
declared it constitutional, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where Money Goes 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to overturn the 9th Circuit 
Court's ruling. Government attorneys said the law is not a revenue-raising 
measure because the money collected from criminals is deposited into the Crime 
Victims Fund and not the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has argued that the measure is an instrument to raise revenues because 
the money goes "into a special fund that provides money for crime victims." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not known how much has been collected since the law went into 
effect, Justice Department lawyers said the 9th Circuit Court's ruling 
invalidates assessments against thousands of persons convicted in the nine 
states covered by the court. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said that, in the fiscal year ending in June, 1988, there were about 
40,000 criminal convictions in federal courts nationwide. She estimated that as 
much as $5 million may have been raised from assessments during that period. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the law is 
unconstitutional, the justices will have to be convinced that they have 
jurisdiction in the matter, Clarke said. The court will have to be convinced 
that it has authority under the 1803 decision in Marbury vs. Madison to review 
laws that originate in Congress and decide whether they are constitutional or 
unconstitutional.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER, 14, KILLED BY SHOTS FROM 2ND CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old youth from the Crenshaw area was fatally wounded early Monday 
when shots were fired at the car he was driving from another car as both cars 
drove south on Crenshaw Boulevard near 39th Street, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the shooting, police suggested that a driving dispute may have 
led to the shooting. But later Monday, South Bureau Homicide Detective James K. 
Vena said detectives "really have no idea" why the shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Vena said Shawn Thomas was struck in the chest by a single bullet. One of his 
passengers took over the wheel and drove to Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in 
Hawthorne, where the youth died a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunman and his driver sped away from the scene and no suspects 
were in custody.

COUNTY TRANSFERS CHILD-DEPENDENCY REINS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNSEL WILL SEEK TO IMPROVE LEGAL SERVICES FOR ABUSED, NEGLECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The curtain was raised on a new era in the legal representation of abused 
children in San Diego County on Monday with the formal transfer of 
responsibility from the district attorney to the county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The changeover means that more lawyers will be available to handle the growing 
number of cases in which abused or neglected children must be removed from 
their homes. In addition, only lawyers with experience or a demonstrated 
commitment to helping children will be selected for the 20-person staff that 
will eventually handle the caseload. In the district attorney's system, lawyers 
were often rotated among departments, regardless of their personal interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Today has really been a day I've been waiting to see happen," said County 
Counsel Lloyd Harmon Jr. "Now we can see the fruits of all this work starting 
to grow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wary at First 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said he was wary when Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller first told him more than 
a year ago that he intended to stop handling the county's juvenile dependency 
unit because the workload was straining his office's resources. But now, Harmon 
said, "I'm gladly accepting it." 
</P>
<P>
"I've come to the conclusion that it is a good change to the system, and the 
Board of Supervisors has given me adequate staffing to do it right." 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors voted June 13 to grant $1.5 million to the 
county counsel's office to pave the way for the transition. Although that was 
considerably less than the $3.2 million Harmon had requested, the money made it 
possible for a top-notch staff to be assembled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys hired for the county counsel's child-dependency division will have 
starting salaries of about $50,000 a year, contrasted with an approximate 
starting salary of $37,000 at the district attorney's office. Upper-level 
supervisors in the county counsel's dependency office will earn about $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the attorneys who had already been handling child-dependency cases for 
the district attorney will move to the county counsel staff, but most of the 
new staff was culled from private law firms or from county counsel offices in 
other counties. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them have some dependency or juvenile court experience," Harmon said. 
"All had some commitment and interest in being in dependency law. That was real 
important to me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Weeks of Training 
</P>
<P>
About half of the newly hired lawyers will began a three-week training period 
Monday and will start to work with the current district attorney's staff in 
court near the end of the month. Harmon said he expects that the transition 
will be complete by early January. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Armour, head of the district attorney's office in Juvenile Court, said 
he too is looking forward to the transition. The district attorney's 
responsibility at Juvenile Court will be cut back to the handling of 
delinquency cases only, which should ease the workload on the existing 
prosecutors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seven attorneys doing this work right now," Armour said. The county 
counsel attorneys "are going to be much better staffed than we are and can 
spend more time on cases and review them more thoroughly." 
</P>
<P>
"The work we did was very, very good . . . but the caseload was so heavy and 
increasing at such a rate it was just impossible to handle without endangering 
the welfare of the very people the system is supposed to protect," Armour said. 
</P>
<P>
When the change was announced, Armour said, he sensed some resistance from the 
Juvenile Court judges. "Some of the judges were reluctant to have us leave. 
They were very comfortable with us in court, and they didn't think the county 
counsel could gear up and take responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Board of Supervisors recognized the importance in this area of 
protecting children and really came through and funded this unit very 
adequately. Once that happened, I think the concerns of people were laid to 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Has Grown 
</P>
<P>
Although the county counsel's office handles child-dependency cases in most 
California counties, the duty has fallen to the district attorney's office here 
for the past 20 years. Before 1970, children who were removed from their homes 
were represented by social service workers, but the problem was not nearly as 
pervasive then as it is now, according to Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the county removed about 3,700 children from their homes because of 
neglect, physical or sexual abuse or other factors that made the homes 
dangerous for the children. This year the county Social Services Department 
estimates it will remove more than 5,000 youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The county's 9-year-old Child Abuse Hotline received 82,720 calls last year, 
63,146 of which were investigated by the Social Services Department -- up 16.6% 
from last year, when 54,154 such calls were investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Children who are removed from their families are first taken to the Hillcrest 
Receiving Home, then transferred to a foster home, unless another relative can 
take the child or unless the abuser is removed from the family home. The county 
has 1,709 foster homes in operation, caring for more than 5,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
The drastic increase in child abuse cases is attribuatable to many factors, 
according to Lloyd Patterson, a spokesman for the Social Services Department. 
Foremost, he said, laws have changed in recent years to require mandatory 
reporting of suspected child abuse cases from more people, including teachers 
and doctors, so a higher percentage of cases are being detected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drugs and Alcohol 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is the sheer population increase in the county. But perhaps the 
most insidious factor is the dramatic rise in drug and alcohol abuse in an area 
that has been dubbed the methamphetamine capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increase in abuse, and a lot of it is probably related to drug and 
alcohol abuse," Patterson said. "Sometimes parents who could normally deal with 
a child lose control when they're under the influence." 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Presiding Judge Napoleon Jones said he has witnessed a similar 
phenomenon from the bench. "Aside from just normal growth, we're the center of 
a lot of societal problems," he said. "There is a lot of addictive behavior on 
the increase, which also impacts the children." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the entire juvenile dependency system suffers from an enormous 
caseload, which will be remedied only when more social workers and judges are 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Services Department has 673 social workers in the Children's 
Services Division, a 19% increase from last year, but is still overburdened, 
according to Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old thing. You never have enough tools to get the job done," he 
said.

SLAYING SUSPECT, SPOTLIGHTED BY TV, SURRENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Roberto Contreras Urbaez, 26, suspected of two killings in Washington, D.C., 
surrendered to police in San Diego Sunday, shortly after being profiled on a 
national television show that asks public help in finding fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
Urbaez had been sought since January, 1988, in the slayings of his former 
girlfriend and her brother, according to Anthony De Lorenzo, an FBI supervisor 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Breslin, spokesman for the TV program "America's Most Wanted," said that 
viewers began calling the show's hot line immediately after a reenactment of 
the shotgun killing of Mona and Tesfaye Shiferaw was aired. 
</P>
<P>
Commentary in the show alleged that the slayings resulted from a "violent 
argument" between the victims and Urbaez, Breslin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspect Called Agents 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials stationed at the TV show's Washington headquarters were fielding 
reponses from tipsters when the suspect called at about 8:30 p.m Pacific time, 
De Lorenzo said. 
</P>
<P>
Urbaez identified himself to FBI agents by giving his Social Security number 
and "other incriminating information that was not disclosed on the television 
show," De Lorenzo said. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Urbaez) said he was calling from a hotel in downtown San Diego and that he 
was about to turn himself in to a police station there," the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the FBI office in San Diego received a call from officers 
at the County Jail, where Urbaez had surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on suspicion of two counts of murder and transferred to the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center, De Lorenzo said. 
</P>
<P>
De Lorenzo said he did not know why Urbaez turned himself in. He described 
Urbaez as a Howard University graduate who had become a computer specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of good calls from people in San Diego came in just before he 
contacted us," De Lorenzo said. "Several people gave information as to where he 
was living and where he had been working. If he didn't turn himself in, there 
is still a good chance the other tips would have led to him."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT LINKED TO OTHER KIDNAPINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The suspected kidnaper of a homeless Orange County girl may have attempted to 
abduct at least 10 other children in the Los Angeles area by luring them into 
his pickup truck, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things match and some things don't," said Manhattan Beach Police Sgt. 
Jack Zea. "We are going to look . . . at his background to see where he has 
been the last couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Uzcanga, 48, who is on parole after a conviction in Santa Ana for 
attempted murder, was arrested Sunday afternoon, a day after a 6-year-old Santa 
Ana girl was kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was found wandering a few hours after she disappeared. Tests were 
being made to determine whether she had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping of the 6-year-old was the 11th reported abduction involving a man 
in a dark blue pickup. Police impounded Uzcanga's blue pickup, but noted that 
it was larger than the truck described in some of the abductions. They said 
Uzcanga was also older than the man described by witnesses in most of the 
incidents.

The world's first rock seance was a partial success, promoter Loni Specter 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, held at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, was intended to lure the 
spirits of deceased guitarists Jim Hendrix, Duane Allman and others into making 
guest appearances at the L.A. Guitar Show. 
</P>
<P>
There was some controversy. One medium refused to preside because, he said, the 
late John Lennon had advised him he was upset at the commercialization of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
During the seance, two spectators said they felt Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix 
speaking through them. But the spirits of the late guitarists left their 
instruments home. No otherworldly rock music was heard. Perhaps the spirits 
refused to play out of sympathy with the musicians on strike in Las Vegas.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RALLY LAUNCHES AIDS AWARENESS MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles political leaders and activists kicked off AIDS Awareness Month 
Monday by calling on area residents to become better educated about the deadly 
disease and more supportive of those affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
"We must realize our best defense is education," Mayor Tom Bradley told about 
200 people at a rally at the Civic Center Mall. "We must call on the entire 
community to help us generate enthusiasm in fighting the lack of information, 
in fighting the tragedy of this disease." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Bennet, executive director of AIDS Project Los Angeles, said he felt 
that he was "preaching to the saved here." 
</P>
<P>
"If we were educating, I feel the mall should be filled with 10,000 people and 
we should be storming buildings," he said. "I feel very frustrated. . . . I 
feel the people who need to be educated are not just in the high-risk 
population, but are elected officials."

<P>
Six anti-abortion activists, who allege that they were hurt during Operation 
Rescue protests at two women's clinics, were denied a federal injunction that 
sought to prevent the Los Angeles Police Department from using so-called pain 
compliance holds in making arrests at demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In denying the request, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima said that the 
protesters' constitutional right to freedom from unreasonable seizure was not 
violated, as they had claimed. Noting that the activists had used passive 
resistance during the arrests, Tashima said that under California law, police 
may use "reasonable force" to make an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the plaintiffs could file damage suits against individual 
officers if they felt they had been abused. Samuel Casey, executive director 
for the Rutherford Institute, which represented the activists, said state law 
allows police to use as much force as needed but not to inflict pain. 
</P>
<P>
The activists were among 700 arrested during a blockade at Family Planning 
Associates Clinic on Westmoreland Avenue in March, and at a similar protest in 
June at Midland Medical Clinic on West Washington Boulevard. About 300 
activists were arrested at the June protest. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the activists said the group plans to appeal.

SYLMAR COCAINE CENTER HANDLED ABOUT 60 TONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Seven men arrested in connection with the seizure of 20 tons of cocaine at a 
Sylmar warehouse were part of an operation that funneled at least 60 tons of 
the drug into the country during the past two years, Los Angeles County Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner told a news conference that his estimate stemmed from a preliminary 
review of handwritten notes and ledgers confiscated at the Sylmar warehouse 
along with $12.2 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"They are about as large as you can get outside of Colombia," Reiner said of 
the suspects. "We know that at a minimum, in the past two years 60 tons of 
cocaine has passed through this warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Appearance 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's allegations preceded a Los Angeles Municipal Court appearance by four 
of the suspects arrested Friday in Los Angeles and surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
James Romero McTague, 41, of El Paso; Mauricio Monroy, 36, of Mexico City; Hugo 
Fernando Castillon, 32, of Sherman Oaks, and Miguel Gonzalez, 34, of Panorama 
City, who has also said his name is Miguel Chavez and Ronald Reagan, were 
denied bail. Their arraignment was scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Three other suspects were arrested Saturday night at Las Vegas' Flamingo Hilton 
hotel -- Carlos Tapia Ponce, 68, allegedly a former Mexican customs officer; 
his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, 34, and Carlos' brother, Hector Tapia, 66. 
</P>
<P>
All appeared before a federal magistrate in Las Vegas on Monday, although 
officials said they did not have enough evidence to charge Carlos' brother, who 
was released. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Huntington Park police authorities took the extraordinary 
precaution of moving the four suspects out of a jail facility in that community 
to another undisclosed location, in part because of concerns for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Their lives aren't worth a plugged nickel based on the doors they could open 
up (for investigators)," Huntington Park Police Sgt. Hal Butler said. "It 
really is the stuff movies are made of." 
</P>
<P>
Butler said the move was prompted by "things . . . happening around the station 
that weren't kosher, such as suspicious people inquiring about the prisoners 
Sunday night." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they have found additional evidence to show that the Los 
Angeles operation was linked to warehouses in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park Police Detective D. J. Fitzgerald said phone numbers found 
during the raids Thursday night at the Sylmar warehouse and at a penthouse 
apartment in Sherman Oaks were traced to warehouses in El Paso and homes in 
Juarez. The information was provided to Drug Enforcement Administration agents 
in El Paso and Mexican authorities in Juarez and the locations were raided 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said the seized records and documents show no indications that the 
drug network had any stop-off points on the transport route between El Paso and 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He said the documents have also provided leads in local spinoff investigations 
of the drug network, but he declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of information," he said. "It is going to take a long time to 
go through it all." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, DEA special agents discovered an underground storage facility 
being excavated in one of six warehouses raided in east El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
"DEA agents who tore down a false wall found a concealed room about the size of 
a living room," said Ray Sepulveda, a DEA special agent in El Paso. "They had 
been digging a pit down about 20 feet. It would have been a good hiding place 
for narcotics." 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Reiner said he planned to turn the Los Angeles cases 
over to federal authorities in the hope that the suspects, if convicted, would 
receive stiffer sentences under federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reason for wanting this case prosecuted in federal court is a simple one," 
Reiner said. "The law in California provides for an absolute maximum sentence 
in this case of about 21 years. But under the federal system and sentencing 
guidelines, these individuals may well serve life in prison without the 
possibility of parole." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the Sylmar seizure, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) sought to compel 
the Bush Administration to decide within a month whether Los Angeles should 
qualify for emergency federal anti-drug assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In letters to members of a House-Senate conference committee negotiating a 
$9.4-billion drug funding bill, Cranston argued that the "shocking enormity" of 
the 20-ton cocaine seizure in Los Angeles made clear that the nation "can no 
longer afford additional delay."

STEVE GARVEY'S EX-WIFE SENT TO JAIL FOR CONTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Cynthia Garvey, the ex-wife of former Dodger Steve Garvey, was ordered to 
county jail for five days Monday for violating a child visitation order. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken to Sybil Brand Institute, the county's overcrowded 
maximum-security jail for women, after Superior Court Judge Frances Rothschild 
found her guilty of 43 counts of contempt and ordered her to begin serving time 
immediately on the first count. 
</P>
<P>
A 126-day sentence -- three days for each of the remaining 42 counts -- was 
stayed pending a hearing on Nov. 3, according to her ex-husband's attorney, 
Dennis Wasser. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Gerald Margolis, could not be reached for comment, although 
Wasser said Monday evening that three lawyers representing her were seeking an 
immediate appellate review. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Cynthia Garvey had "willfully" disobeyed a December, 1988, order 
requiring that the couple's daughters, Whitney, 13, and Krisha, 14, spend 
Tuesday afternoons and every other weekend with their father, and that he be 
allowed to speak with them by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
However, since the first of the year, Wasser said, "the only time Steve Garvey 
has seen his daughters is when they have been in court or in sessions with 
counselors." 
</P>
<P>
He said the first concern of the former first-base star for the Dodgers and the 
Padres was: "How will this affect my girls? I'd better go see them." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, who now lives in Del Mar, was reunited with his daughters in Los 
Angeles late Monday, after being awarded joint legal custody. The couple was 
divorced in 1981. Since then, the former talk-show hostess has written an 
autobiography, "The Secret Life of Cyndy Garvey," and begun to refer to herself 
as Cynthia. 
</P>
<P>
The retired ballplayer, who now runs a marketing company and has his own radio 
talk show in San Diego, made news recently after two women announced they were 
expecting his children; he promised to provide financial and parental support. 
He married a third woman, Candace Thomas, last February. 
</P>
<P>
Candace Garvey said Cynthia Garvey had been complying with the visitation order 
until last New Year's Day, when her daughter told her that her father was 
engaged.

VOTERS FILL VACANT ASSEMBLY SEAT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending a race that has drawn national attention as a referendum on abortion, 
voters in San Diego and Riverside counties will go to the polls today in a 
special election to select a new state Assembly member in the 76th District. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-month campaign marked by increasing acrimony in its final days, 
voters will choose among four candidates -- two of them write-ins -- to fill 
the vacancy created by the death last June of Assemblyman Bill Bradley 
(R-Escondido). 
</P>
<P>
Republican Tricia Hunter, a Bonita nurse who finished first in August's 
eight-candidate primary, and Democrat Jeannine Correia, a teacher of the 
retarded from Poway, head the field, which also includes two Republican 
write-in candidates -- Poway businessman Dick Lyles and Lakeside accountant 
Kirby Bowser. 
</P>
<P>
Voters unsure of where to vote or those who experience other Election Day 
problems may contact the Registrar of Voters office at 565-5800 for assistance. 
The 76th District stretches from the South Bay to northeastern San Diego County 
and into the desert communities of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
During the primary, the 76th District contest generated intensive news coverage 
as one of the first tests of the political fallout from last summer's U.S. 
Supreme Court decision giving the states new powers to regulate abortions. Of 
the six Republicans in the primary, only Hunter was pro-choice on the volatile 
abortion issue -- a distinction that helped her draw backing from groups that 
typically support Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of the abortion issue has been diminished somewhat in the 
runoff by the fact that Democrat Correia is, like Hunter, pro-choice. However, 
the write-in candidacy of Lyles, who strongly opposes abortion, has kept the 
issue alive as a potentially pivotal factor in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
In a race in which the unusual has been the norm, it perhaps is not surprising 
that the results of today's race might not be known until Wednesday because of 
the write-in ballots, particularly those cast for Lyles, who finished a close 
second in the primary behind Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials do not plan to count and verify most of the write-in ballots 
cast at the polls today until Wednesday, though they will calculate the number 
of write-ins cast. Therefore, if the number of write-in ballots is greater than 
the number of votes cast for either Hunter or Correia, the election's outcome 
will be uncertain until Wednesday.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena dentist convicted of killing his wife near her La Jolla home was 
given a January retrial date Monday to determine whether he was sane at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Dustin, 54, was found guilty March 17 of first-degree murder, but the 
jury deadlocked over the sanity phase. Dustin's conviction for the Sept. 13, 
1987, murder of his estranged wife, Adelheid (Heide) Dustin, 50, will stand, 
and the second jury will have only the sanity issue to decide. 
</P>
<P>
If found to be sane, Dustin will be sent to state prison for 25 years to life. 
If found insane, he is likely to be committed to a state mental hospital for 
the criminally insane, possibly for life. 
</P>
<P>
In his first trial, Dustin was represented by attorney John Mitchell, whom he 
had hired with his own funds. But Dustin requested and got a public defender, 
William Youmans, to represent him at his second trial. 
</P>
<P>
Dustin's office was in Pasadena, and he lived in San Marino with his son at the 
time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had said that most of the examining psychiatrists found Dustin to be 
insane at the time of the slaying, but Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike Carpenter argued 
to jurors that Dustin could distinguish right from wrong.

HIGH COURT TO CONSIDER S.D. DISABILITY CASE 
</P>

The Supreme Court agreed to consider making it easier for the government to cut 
off disability pay to some former federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
In a California case, the court said Monday that it will review a ruling that 
barred termination of a disability annuity for a National City man who was 
given incorrect information about benefits eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Richmond, a retired Navy welder, asked a federal official in 1986 how 
much money he was allowed to make as a bus driver without sacrificing his 
disability annuity. 
</P>
<P>
He was told that, if his pay for two years exceeded 80% of what his welder's 
job had paid, he would lose the disability benefit. Richmond also was given an 
out-of-date federal manual with the same information. 
</P>
<P>
Congress had amended the law in 1982 to cut off annuity payments to anyone 
making more than 80% of the former government job's one-year salary. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond in 1986 did some overtime work as a bus driver and earned $19,936. 
Eighty percent of his pay as a Navy welder that year would have been $19,016. 
</P>
<P>
When the government cut off his disability annuity because he exceeded the 
ceiling, Richmond challenged the decision. He said he had relied on the 
misinformation he received from the government. 
</P>
<P>
A federal appeals court here ordered the annuity restored. The appeals court 
said in a ruling last December that the government recklessly misled Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers, in appealing to the Supreme Court, said the 
government should not be prevented "from executing the laws as written by 
Congress because of the errors of government agents." 
</P>
<P>
The appeal also said Richmond suffered little harm. It accused him of trying 
"to work the system as close to the edge as possible," seeking to keep the 
annuity while making as much in bus driver wages as he could.

HIDDEN HILLS PLANS POLL ON LOW-COST UNITS FOR SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hidden Hills City Council outlined a plan Monday to poll its residents 
early next year about a proposal to build a low-cost housing project for senior 
citizens on the edge of the gated community. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering a proposal to build 46 units of affordable housing for 
senior citizens outside the town's two gates on a small portion of 25 acres the 
city would annex. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would allow the city to comply with state housing law as well as 
settle a lawsuit over its redevelopment agency. The redevelopment agency, 
formed in 1984 to fund a flood-control project, was the target of a lawsuit by 
Los Angeles County alleging that Hidden Hills is not a blighted area and should 
not reap the tax benefits of redevelopment. The settlement hinges on the city's 
compliance with state law requiring that a portion of redevelopment funds be 
spent on affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
But at two public meetings last month, a group of residents emerged who 
strongly oppose the affordable housing proposal. Their opposition prompted the 
City Council to agree to conduct an informal poll of the town's residents. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the council also formed a committee to advise it on how to 
conduct the poll. Mayor Chris K. Van Paski named himself and Councilman H. 
Brian Herdeg to the committee along with four residents, three of whom have 
publicly opposed the senior citizen housing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Van Paski suggested that the advisory committee forward its recommendations to 
the council on Nov. 20, two weeks after the council is expected to mail an 
informational letter to the residents. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the City Council will accept written arguments on the proposal, 
which will be quoted in the poll forms, to be distributed in January. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Wayne K. Lemieux has maintained that the senior citizen proposal 
would have little impact on the quality of life in the rural city of 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-unit project outside the town's gates would be separated from the 
existing city by a hill, and access roads would be separate from those leading 
to the city, according to Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
It would be built on about two acres of the 25-acre area proposed for 
annexation. The developer, Danny Howard, wants to build a small commercial area 
on about three acres next to the senior citizen project and nine luxury homes 
on the remaining 20 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hidden Hills told the Southern California Assn. of Governments that 
it had no room left to build affordable housing, but the regional planning 
agency rejected the argument. 
</P>
<P>
Some support for the affordable housing proposal has emerged in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Appleton, an active member of the town's community association, last 
week sent residents a letter in which he appealed to what he called Hidden 
Hills' "silent majority." Appleton wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"If we were talking about a leper colony or a maximum-security prison, I might 
understand the negative public outcry. . . . The inference that somehow these 
lower-class citizens will somehow sully our pristine community makes me ill. 
Many who currently live inside our gates could not afford it if they had to buy 
in at today's rates."

DEUKMEJIAN VETOES BILL ON SUBWAY LINK TO METRO RAIL; 
</P>
<P>
CONCEPT REMAINS VIABLE, BACKERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that dismayed homeowners and elected officials in the eastern San 
Fernando Valley, Gov. George Deukmejian on Monday vetoed legislation requiring 
that a proposed Metro Rail extension in the area be built underground. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he killed the bill, authored by state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana), because it "would insert the state in a matter that is and should 
be the jurisdiction of local authorities." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said that when Los Angeles voters approved a ballot measure 
providing sales tax revenues for mass transit, they gave the county 
transportation commission authority over such questions and "the state should 
not become involved. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he was saddened by the governor's action. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill becoming law would have been the most significant step that could 
have possibly happened for 21st-Century transportation planning for the San 
Fernando Valley," he said. "It would have meant protection and security for all 
potential residential areas against at-grade or elevated rapid transit lines." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is 
constructing a countywide rail network, had strongly opposed the bill, arguing 
that the state should not dictate the design of a locally financed project. 
</P>
<P>
But commission officials said the governor's veto does not mean the subway 
concept is dead. It is one of several Valley transit alternatives that will be 
evaluated in an environmental report now being drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Viable 
</P>
<P>
"The idea remains, and it will be treated equally with the others," said 
Richard Stanger, the commission's rail development director. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner groups vehemently opposed an above-ground rail line through East 
Valley residential areas, saying it would split neighborhoods and create noise, 
traffic and safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins had portrayed his plan, assembled with the help of Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude, as the only politically feasible way to build a Metro 
Rail line through the Valley. The lawmakers persuaded many local businesses, 
homeowner groups and elected officials to back it. 
</P>
<P>
County transit planners are studying two east-west rail routes through the 
Valley. One would run along the Ventura Freeway's southern shoulder from Metro 
Rail's planned northern terminus in Universal City to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The other would run for 15 miles from North Hollywood to Warner Center along a 
Southern Pacific railroad right of way that follows Chandler and Victory 
boulevards and Oxnard and Topham streets. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials are studying both routes either as Metro Rail extensions or 
for light-rail trolleys. They also plan to examine putting the line underground 
in residential areas and above ground elsewhere on both routes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
25-Foot Depth 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' bill would have required that either line be built below ground level 
in a 3.6-mile corridor bordered by the Hollywood Freeway on the east and 
Hazeltine Avenue in Van Nuys on the west. In the middle segment -- between 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Woodman Avenue -- the line would have had to have 
been at least 25 feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
Stanger said the veto would have no effect on the transportation commission's 
planning process. The agency is awaiting an environmental impact report due in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials have said they will take widespread public support for a 
subway into consideration when deciding what type of line to build. But the 
issue of affordability also looms large for the commission, which is building 
the Long Beach-Los Angeles and Century Freeway light-rail lines and 
contributing to Metro Rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates of the cost of Valley rail plans are $900 million for a 
15-mile light-rail system and $2.4 billion for a 15-mile all-subway system. A 
partial subway of the type proposed by Robbins and Braude -- which would be 
about seven miles long -- would cost $1 billion to $1.5 billion, Stanger said.

Morris Jacobs takes his religion seriously. On a recent Saturday, the rules of 
the home where he lives interfered with his plans to attend a late-night 
service. He wasn't satisfied until the director of social services, Amos Freid, 
was paged to resolve the problem. Jacobs lives at the Grancell Village of the 
Jewish Home for the Aging in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm 91 years old, so I'm not fast on talking. Born in Hungary. The town is 
Borlese near Satmar. That was a big city. This was a real Jewish city. I grew 
up there. My dad had a job with the government, but beside that we had a liquor 
store, like a saloon. 
</P>
<P>
I really wanted to leave when I was 15. I had my passport already to come, but 
my dad and mom, they talked me out of it. And then came the war and I said, 
"See, if you would have let me go, I would not have to be a soldier here." 
</P>
<P>
I went into the Army in 1915, March. I was 16 years old. I was a big boy 
always, heavyset, so they put me to work to make the road for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, right away I said I'm going. And they didn't keep me back. I was 
a man already. I was 21 years old when I left. 
</P>
<P>
In America you're a free man. That means a lot to me. It's not like in Europe. 
In Europe the government tells you what to do, but here you're a free man. I 
like this country because it's whatever you want to do. Nothing keeps you back. 
</P>
<P>
As a child I was religious, but I came out to this country, I couldn't keep up 
religion. I didn't have time for everything. I didn't have religion till I came 
into the home. So I kept religion and it's in me. 
</P>
<P>
I get up about 3:30 in the morning. I wash and dress up, and then I sit down 
and read Psalm of David. There's seven portions, that's one portion I read 
every day and then start over again. That takes about three-quarters of an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Then I put on my shawl, we call it a tallit, and start my praying for the day. 
That takes another three-quarters of an hour. Each day is different. Here in 
this home there isn't anybody else who does the morning prayers. 
</P>
<P>
Slichoth is the preparation for the big holiday, for the Rosh Hashanah and Yom 
Kippur. The rabbi talks about what's coming up, about Yom Kippur, you know, 
everything. And the cantor, we have a very good cantor there. An evening like 
that I wouldn't miss for anything. 
</P>
<P>
I was all dressed up. I have full suit, everybody said it's a beautiful suit. 
Eight years ago I got it. I'm going to take a cab, and I'll go there. 
</P>
<P>
But they wouldn't let me go. The nurse called the head nurse, and the head 
nurse called Amos, and he came down. He says, "Morris, you can't go." I said, 
"I have to go. I'm going." It was close to 11 already, and we talked so much, 
he took me himself. 
</P>
<P>
So he dropped me, and he had a nurse to stay with me over there. When I came 
out after services ended, about 1:30, the nurse said, "Morris, how are we going 
to go home?" I said, "Get a cab." So one of the fellows said, "No, you aren't 
going to get a cab, I'll take you." 
</P>
<P>
That happened about a week ago. Before that I was going out and nobody said 
anything. I wanted to go shopping, and all of a sudden they says, "You can't 
go." See, the home is responsible for their people in here and they wouldn't 
let me. So I didn't go. 
</P>
<P>
Since then they took my picture. The guard knows me, but sometimes he's off. 
They got a picture of me in the booth there so somebody else will know me. If I 
want to go, I know ways to go out here. But I don't try to go. 
</P>
<P>
I'm 91 years old, and you know it's hard living here for me. My legs, I have to 
have the walker. I can't hear good. I can't see good. Just about everything is 
going, so I wouldn't mind to die. When my wife died, only be five years, that 
took everything out of me. 
</P>
<P>
I always enjoy our religion. It means everything. It is in my soul. When I die, 
as according to my religion, we go on a next world, shall I say. No, I'm not 
good in English to explain you like that, but what I mean is, I believe that 
I'm going to go to heaven.

DAVID CARRADINE GETS JAIL, PROBATION FOR DRUNK DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor David Carradine was sentenced Friday to 48 hours in jail, three years 
probation and ordered to work full time for 30 days on a Caltrans roadway 
maintenance crew in addition to performing 100 hours of community service for 
driving drunk last month in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Carradine, who starred in the television show "Kung Fu," pleaded no contest 
Friday in Van Nuys Municipal Court to one count of driving under the influence 
of alcohol. His blood-alcohol level was more than 0.10, the legal standard for 
driving under the influence of alcohol, said Deputy City Atty. David 
Kestenbaum. A second count of driving under the influence was dismissed in 
exchange for Carradine's no-contest plea, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education Program 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stephens also ordered Carradine to attend an alcohol 
education program for one year and to attend one drunk-driving awareness 
meeting sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving. At these meetings, people 
convicted of drunk-driving offenses listen to talks by mothers and other family 
members who have lost loved ones in traffic accidents, said Deputy City Atty. 
Lisa Kissel. 
</P>
<P>
Carradine also is not to drive anywhere except to work and alcohol meetings for 
one year, Kissel said. 
</P>
<P>
Carradine was arrested by California Highway Patrol officers at about 12:45 
a.m. Sept. 8 at Primera Place and Lindo Street in the Cahuenga Pass area after 
he was observed stopped at a green light and straddling the center line, Kissel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Carradine failed a field sobriety test. His blood-alcohol level was 0.17. 
</P>
<P>
Carradine, represented by attorney Emanuel Barling Jr., admitted a previous 
conviction from November, 1984, for driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
Kissel said the sentence is typical for a second drunk-driving conviction. 
Carradine could have received a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a 
$1,000 fine, Kestenbaum said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VENTURA WOMAN BADLY BEATEN IN STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 27-year-old manager of a Radio Shack store in Newbury Park was in very 
critical condition Monday after a San Diego man entered the store and beat her 
on the head with a metal object, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department 
reported. The man was arrested a short time later by deputies acting on a 
description of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators could find no motive for the savage attack in the usually 
tranquil community. "I have no idea why this individual would do this," said 
Detective Mike Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Ann Ramos, a resident of Ventura, was rushed to Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center in Thousand Oaks after a customer in the store in the 700 block 
of Wendy Drive noticed her lying on the floor and called for help, Sgt. Marty 
Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes would not divulge what type of metal object was used in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies later arrested Rossano Barin Santonil, 27, on a street nearby, Rouse 
said. Authorities were given a description of a suspect by a man who saw him in 
the store minutes before the attack, Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
Santonil was being held at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempted 
murder. Rouse said investigators found no evidence that the man intended to 
commit a robbery or that he knew Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very shocking," Rouse said.

CAR KILLS PEDESTRIAN ON SEPULVEDA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A car struck and killed a woman walking across a street in Sepulveda Monday, 
the Los Angeles Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was about 55. Her name was not released until relatives could be 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
She was not in a crosswalk when she was struck shortly after 8 p.m., Sgt. Bill 
Selesky said. She died at the scene of the accident, near Woodman Avenue in the 
13600 block of Roscoe Boulevard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, a 24-year-old man whose name was not immediately 
available, was not cited, but an investigation into the accident had not been 
completed, Selesky said.

SAL AUNESE REMEMBERED AT TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VISTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sal Aunese left here three years ago for the University of Colorado to play 
quarterback and get an education. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese performed the first task brilliantly, leading the Colorado Buffaloes to 
an 8-4 season and a Freedom Bowl appearance in his second year as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese did not have the opportunity to complete the second task. 
</P>
<P>
He died of stomach cancer Sept. 23 at age 21. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 friends, teammates, coaches and family members paid tribute to 
Aunese Monday at the First Samoan Congregational Christian Church. 
</P>
<P>
And they talked of lessons in life they had learned from Aunese. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the great performances I will remember about Sal, but how humble he 
was," Coach Bill McCartney said. "When we won, he would always deflect the 
praise. When we lost, he would always take responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Barnett, Colorado quarterback coach, remembered that a reporter told him 
Aunese was not a good interview after the quarterback had run for 185 yards in 
his first college game because he kept praising his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
But after a loss to Oklahoma, Barnett said another reporter told how Aunese 
"called all the reporters over and said, 'I'm the guy. I'm the reason we lost.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said he learned something from Aunese he never expected -- a lesson 
in culture. 
</P>
<P>
His family, the tremendous bond, the depth of their love -- it touched us," 
McCartney said. "They spent so much time with us that we couldn't help but 
notice that Sal developed this winning, this humility, right there in the roots 
of his home." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said Aunese brought the Samoan culture to the Colorado campus in 
Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught us about heart, about love, about unconditional love," Barnett said. 
"There was no one Sal didn't accept or love." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado teammate Mike Jones, who played against Aunese in high school, said he 
will always recall his Aunese's fighting attitude. Jones, who was joined at the 
memorial by eight other Colorado teammates and Athletic Director Bill Murray, 
said it was that attitude which pulled the team through in Saturday's 45-28 
victory over the favored Washington Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people counted us out this weekend," Jones said. "They didn't know 
how we'd respond, but they didn't know Sal. Sal left us with the will to win, 
survive through anything. 
</P>
<P>
"When things got bad, our defense always knew if there was one tick on the 
clock and we gave the ball back to Sal, he'd pull some magic. And he usually 
did." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney also discussed his grandson. Aunese fathered the son of McCartney's 
daughter, Kristin. 
</P>
<P>
"He has that same smile, the same flair for life and the same mischievous 
streak that we saw in the left-hander from Vista," McCartney said. "We're going 
to love him and tell him about his daddy and see to it that he carries on the 
tradition. " 
</P>
<P>
Aunese is survived by his parents, three sisters and three brothers.

A CLEAR-CUT WIN BY BEARS OVER EAGLES 
</P>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No foggy excuses for the Philadelphia Eagles this time. 
</P>
<P>
This time they weren't weather-beaten. This time they could see their hands in 
front of their faces -- but still couldn't get out of their own way. 
</P>
<P>
Outplayed by the unbeaten Chicago Bears most of the way, the Eagles were 
manhandled Monday night, 27-13, even though Randall Cunningham passed for an 
eye-popping 246 yards in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Cunningham threw a club-record 62 passes for 401 yards, but he also 
had four passes intercepted and was sacked four times. He amassed 350 of his 
passing yards after halftime -- and still only put one touchdown on the board. 
</P>
<P>
On a clear night at Soldier Field before 66,625 fans with long memories who 
sarcastically chanted "Buddy, Buddy," Buddy Ryan's Eagles lost again to Mike 
Ditka's Bears, as they have four times now since Ryan quit his job coaching 
Ditka's defense after Chicago won Super Bowl XX. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Philadelphia hasn't won a football game in this town in 53 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bear quarterback Mike Tomczak had little trouble solving Ryan's defense Monday, 
throwing three touchdown passes. Chicago remained one of the National Football 
League's perfect teams, along with the Rams and New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's record fell to 2-2, and Cunningham had an experience nearly as 
forgettable as the National Football Conference playoff game here last New 
Year's Eve, which was played in a fog as thick as pea soup. The Bears won that 
day, 20-12, to the consternation of the Eagles, who believed the officials 
should have halted play. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last week, Cunningham was still bemoaning that fact, saying: "If 
we'd had different refs, we would have won the game. We didn't think it was a 
fair game." 
</P>
<P>
Well, this one was fair and fog-free, but Cunningham's luck was no better. 
Besides his official interceptions and sacks, Cunningham had another 
interception and a fumble that were overturned by officials upon further 
review. His receivers also fumbled away two completed passes in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bears are a better team than we expected," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
It was like a Punt, Pass &amp; Kick competition for Randall. He even punted for 
Philadelphia, taking over for the injured John Teltschik, and got one off that 
traveled 57 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles trailed at halftime, 13-0 -- the first time in 40 games that they 
have failed to score in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
After driving to Chicago's 48 on their first possession, they didn't convert 
another third-down play until late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But after that, Cunningham limbered up his right arm. He found wide receiver 
Gregg Garrity for a 24-yard score with 12:06 left to make the score 20-10. A 
minute and a half later, after Chicago's Neal Anderson fumbled, Cunningham went 
37 yards to Cris Carter to the Chicago two, and suddenly this looked to be a 
ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
However, typical of his wildly erratic evening, Cunningham tried three passes 
for the touchdown instead of handing off -- and connected on none. The Eagles 
settled for Luis Zendejas' second field goal, and never scored again. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago struck back with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Tomczak to tight end 
James Thornton, who stumbled and bulled his way the final 20 yards. That one 
came with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
There was one last threat from Cunningham, but Cris Carter coughed up a 
reception at the Bear 27, for Philadelphia's sixth and final turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive standouts for the Bears were free safety Shaun Gayle, with two 
interceptions, and defensive end Richard Dent, with 2 1/2 sacks. Cunningham 
spent most of the game on the lam, Chicago rookie linebacker John Roper also 
sacking him twice. 
</P>
<P>
This was the 56th victory in 67 regular-season games for Ditka's Bears since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Not many people thought we could be 4-0 starting out with games against the 
likes of Cincinnati, Minnesota and Philadelphia. But, it happened," Ditka said. 
"We must be awfully lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka was just trying to be cute with that last remark, as he was with his next 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"Enjoy your hamburgers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That one was a sly dig at Ryan, who was featured in a popular burger chain's 
recent advertising campaign, offering discount burgers to customers if the 
Bears won, and discount french fries if the Eagles won. 
</P>
<P>
"Hope y'all enjoy fries," Ryan says at commercial's end. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan took the defeat hard, and not just because he was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a disappointing loss," Ryan said. "It was probably a more disappointing 
loss than the Fog Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of blocking a punt, we rough the kicker. Instead of intercepting a 
couple of balls, (the Bears) end up getting touchdowns off them when we broke 
the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to lose anywhere, but the Eagles haven't won here in 53 years. 
You don't lose that many times to many people and stay in this business too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia finished with only 67 yards rushing. Anderson gained 85 by himself 
for Chicago, also scoring the game's only rushing touchdown on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The other Bear touchdowns came on Tomczak's first-half passes of 14 yards to 
Dennis McKinnon and one yard to fullback Matt Suhey. Tomczak, who completed 24 
of 38 passes for 266 yards, is 20-3 as a starting quarterback.

RAIDER DEFENSE CAUSES COACHES TO DIG DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With two consecutive shutouts, the Moorpark College defense is hot. 
</P>
<P>
Hot enough to burn holes in the pockets of Raider coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark coaches treat the team to a barbecue steak dinner when the defense 
records a shutout. The Raiders blanked Compton, 55-0, Saturday and the $200 
dinner bill was split seven ways between coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting expensive," said Jim Bittner, Moorpark's coach. "I'm going to 
start cheering for the other team." 
</P>
<P>
Grounded: Albert Fann, Northridge's two-time All-Western Football Conference 
tailback, was held to a season-low 33 yards in 13 carries Saturday night at Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Fann, who was averaging 103 yards rushing per game, was grounded to a halt, but 
Northridge still managed a 13-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take (Fann) away if you have good people like they do and put enough 
of them up there," said Bob Burt, CSUN's coach, "but it just opens up something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Sherdrick Bonner, the Matadors' quarterback, was the team's leading rusher with 
59 yards in 14 carries, including 18 yards in losses from two sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, we have a lot of weapons," Burt said. "Sherdrick's feet and 
athletic ability can cause a lot of problems for people." 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time: Northridge's 13-10 victory over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo was 
only its sixth in 29 meetings with the Mustangs. The Matadors had won on San 
Luis Obispo's home field only once before, in 1964, when the Mustangs finished 
0-10. 
</P>
<P>
Strong-armed Armstrong: Steve Armstrong, who helped Agoura High win a Southern 
Section Desert-Mountain Conference championship in 1984, has been a college 
football vagabond. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong went to West Point out of Agoura, but was cut from Army's football 
team. He attended West Point in the fall semester of 1985, then spent three 
semesters and played one season at Moorpark College. He is now in his third 
football season at UC Santa Barbara, where his job as quarterback is to keep 
the Gauchos on the move. 
</P>
<P>
He did just that last Saturday against Cal Lutheran, completing 16 of 29 passes 
for 184 yards and three touchdowns in a 24-21 UCSB victory. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong was a surprise starter against Cal Lutheran, replacing Mike Curtius. 
Armstrong played well enough to earn another start on Saturday against Sonoma 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet revenge: For four Glendale College players, Saturday's game against 
Pierce was more than just another Western State Conference game. It was a 
chance to perform against their former team. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Ronnie Lopez, running back Wes Bender, center Mark Overstreet and 
defensive end Eric Fiori of Glendale all played at Pierce last season. 
</P>
<P>
John Cicuto, Glendale's coach, said there wasn't much love lost between the two 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
"They were real excited about playing against (Pierce) because I guess they 
didn't have a great experience," Cicuto said "There also, apparently, were some 
comments from Pierce about their ability. So they were pleased with the way 
things turned out." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Bender had big games as Glendale defeated Pierce, 43-15. Lopez ran 
for a touchdown and completed seven of eight passes for 131 yards and another 
score. Bender had seven carries for 60 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Scrappy defender: Three weeks after missing a game for "personal reasons," 
Reggie Williams had one of the finest games in his three years at a starting 
cornerback in the Northridge secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 5-9, 170-pound senior, had nine unassisted tackles and was credited 
with four pass breakups Saturday in CSUN's 13-10 victory over Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
"He played like his nickname, Scrap Iron," said Bob Burt, CSUN's coach. "He was 
always in the right position doing exactly what he is supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets available: The wave would have hardly been a ripple among the 1,814 
fans rattling around UC Santa Barbara's 17,000-seat Harder Stadium for the Cal 
Lutheran game on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium attendance record is 11,000, and Harder has only hosted two crowds 
of 10,000 or more. The university decided to expand the stadium's capacity from 
12,000 to 17,000 in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Playing to win: Chuck Ferrero, coach of the Valley College football team, had a 
choice to make -- one he said was really no choice at all. Valley could have 
gone for a field goal in order to tie L. A. Southwest Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Monarchs went for a touchdown and the win. But Mark Mengoli's 
12-yard scoring pass to Sean Brown with no time left was nullified by a holding 
penalty and Valley fell, 12-9. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ferrero is convinced he made a popular choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a non-division game, so it doesn't affect where we finish in the 
standings, " Ferrero said "I think most people would rather see us go for a win 
and not make it than go for a tie and get it. 
</P>
<P>
"The players play to win and so do I."

COLLEGE DIVISION / MITCH POLIN;

<P>
ON THIS POINT, CLAREMONT GOT A BIT DEFENSIVE 
</P>

<P>
The Claremont-Mudd-Scripps football team accomplished a scoring rarity in its 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game against Whittier 
on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Stags scored a defensive extra point. Make that two points. 
</P>
<P>
Under a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rule that took effect last season, a 
play is considered live on extra-point attempts, not dead once the attempt 
fails, as it was previously. 
</P>
<P>
That means a defense can block a point-after attempt or intercept a two-point 
conversion pass and return it the length of the field for two points. 
</P>
<P>
Grayle Howlett, publicity director for the SCIAC and California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn., said that it has not occurred often since the rule has been in 
place. In fact, it had never happened before in an SCIAC game. 
</P>
<P>
But it happened in Claremont's game against Whittier, after Whittier drove for 
a touchdown on its first possession of the second half, cutting its deficit to 
21-13. 
</P>
<P>
On the conversion attempt, Claremont defensive back Mike McCorkle blocked the 
kick and the ball bounced to teammate Jon Bagatelos, who took it 75 yards for 
the score and a 23-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was a first for Claremont, which had a near miss when it scored in the same 
fashion in a game against Trinity of Texas last season, only to have the play 
called back because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The play did little to faze Whittier. The Poets rallied to score two more 
touchdowns for a 27-23 win. It was the first victory of the season for Whittier 
(1-2). Claremont fell to 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
The season didn't get off to the best start for either the Cal State Northridge 
or Occidental football teams but things have looked considerably better lately. 
</P>
<P>
After dropping its first two games to NCAA Division I teams, 28-9 to Cal State 
Long Beach and 27-20 to Cal State Fullerton, Northridge has rebounded for three 
consecutive comeback victories against Division II squads. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors defeated Sonoma State, 15-10, Central State of Oklahoma, 31-28, 
and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 13-10. The prospect also appears good for another 
victory Saturday when Northridge plays host to struggling Cal Lutheran (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
Occidental also opened its season with two losses, 16-14 to Menlo and 14-0 to 
Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Tigers picked up a win off the field when Azusa Pacific 
forfeited the game because it used an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Occidental (3-1) has won its last two games by scores of 24-14 
over Pomona-Pitzer and 24-12 over La Verne. The Tigers have a bye Saturday but 
face a difficult test against the University of San Diego (4-0) on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
With less than a month remaining in the season, the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
women's soccer team appears to be well on its way toward its first NCAA 
Division II playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros (11-1), ranked No. 2 in Division II, certainly took a big step in the 
right direction with a 2-1 victory over Cal State Hayward on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It was a significant win considering that Hayward was ranked No. 3 and has been 
one of the top teams in the West in Division II in recent years. The Toros also 
defeated Sonoma State, another top-ranked team from the West, on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
That appears to put the Toros in a solid position to reach the four-team 
Division II playoffs in November. Barry University of Florida is the top-ranked 
team in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
Two players from Dominguez Hills have also put themselves in good position for 
All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way on offense has been senior forward Kristi White, who has 11 
goals and 10 assists. That's more points than some teams have scored this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
White is the school's all-time leader in points with 79 and assists with 25 and 
also has 27 goals, which leaves her two short of the record held by Michele 
Salas. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more impressive has been the play of goalkeeper Chris Pezzulo, a 
junior transfer from El Camino College. Pezzulo has an 0.22 goals-against 
average with nine shutouts. She has already tied the school record for most 
shutouts in a season that was established by Sandra Powers in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
After winning its first 10 games, including three games over NCAA Division I 
opponents, the Cal State Bakersfield men's soccer team finally had its first 
setback in a 2-0 loss to Cal State Sacramento last Saturday in Sacramento. Even 
so, the Roadrunners are ranked No. 2 -- their highest ranking ever -- in the 
latest Division II poll and No. 1 in the West Region. Bakersfield should get a 
strong challenge in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. race from 
defending champion Cal State Northridge -- a Division II finalist last season. 
</P>
<P>
For the second week in a row, UC Riverside (12-3) has been ranked No. 1 in NCAA 
Division II women's volleyball. Other CCAA teams listed in the top 20 are Cal 
State Northridge at No. 4, Cal State Bakersfield at No. 13, Chapman at No. 16 
and Cal Poly Pomona at No. 17. . . . Defending champion Point Loma Nazarene 
will be among the favorites in both the men's and women's divisions at the 
Golden State Athletic Conference cross-country championships Oct. 14 at Morley 
Field in San Diego. Westmont and Azusa Pacific are also among the top teams in 
the women's division. 
</P>
<P>
The Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men's soccer team is off to one of its best starts 
with an 8-0-1 record and is ranked No. 16 in the latest NCAA Division III poll. 
The Stags have been led by senior goalkeeper Steve Goodson, who began the week 
with seven consecutive shutouts and 28 in his career. . . . Cal State San 
Bernardino will hold a free soccer clinic for boys and girls in high school and 
younger at noon Oct. 22 on the school's soccer field. Women's coach Ralph 
Perez, who is also an assistant with the U.S. national team, and men's coach 
Carlos Juarez will be instructors. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State San Bernardino men's soccer team, trying to stay in position for 
an NCAA Division III playoff berth with a 6-3 record, split its matches against 
two of the top teams in the West Region in Division III last week. The 
sixth-ranked Coyotes defeated Macalester of St. Paul, Minn., 2-1, and lost to 
Colorado College, 5-1, at the Colorado College tournament in Colorado Springs.

EDD PLAYS MATCHMAKER BETWEEN EMPLOYERS, JOBLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Employers know that finding and hiring even one employee can be a trying 
experience. So, when Sue Taylor, human resources director at the new Sheraton 
Grande Torrey Pines in La Jolla, needed 320 new employees she decided to get 
some help. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor called the state's Employment Development Department, which provided 
Sheraton with interviewers to help screen applicants. The department also 
allowed Sheraton to use its downtown office for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a labor exchange market for both the employer and the client 
(prospective applicant) who comes into our office," said Mamie Greene, the 
department's special projects supervisor. All of the services provided by the 
department are financed by taxpayers' dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers place job offers with us, and we conduct searches for people who 
come in here looking for jobs," Greene said. "We'll help out on mass hirings," 
such as Sheraton's, "or, if an employer calls and just wants one receptionist, 
we'll do that, too. We'll search through our files and refer qualified 
applicants to that employer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sheraton Gets Help 
</P>
<P>
With more than 250 job applicants flooding two interview sites Monday, Sheraton 
officials were glad to get the help. 
</P>
<P>
"They've eliminated much of the early groundwork for us," said Taylor, who must 
fill a variety of positions, from butlers to banquet servers, for the 
$60-million luxury-class hotel. Sheraton officials expect the EDD to screen 
more than 1,000 applicants in the next two weeks. The company will then hire 
about 320 employees to staff the 400-room hotel that opens Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"They're doing the pre-screening to see if they (candidates) have the 
experience and qualifications necessary to work for us," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides screening walk-in applicants, EDD will search its list of potential 
employees and invite candidates who meet an employer's criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them (suitable applicants) that Sheraton was hiring and told them to 
come on in," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EDD Conducts Interviews 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, EDD sends staff members to an employer's office to help conduct 
interviews. But, if the employer doesn't have the space to conduct such 
interviews or would rather hold them elsewhere, the department allows employers 
to use EDD offices. 
</P>
<P>
There are seven EDD offices in the county -- Oceanside, Escondido, downtown San 
Diego, El Cajon, San Diego East, the South Bay and Southeast San Diego. The 
department also administers unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Sheraton executives are interviewing applicants at two locations. One is at 
temporary offices in La Jolla, 3242 Holiday Court, Suite 206. Interviews at 
this site will be held Monday through Saturday until Oct. 14 (9 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Monday and Tuesday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday through Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
Interviews will also be conducted at the San Diego EDD office, 1354 Front St., 
9 a.m to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday until Oct. 13.

PERSONALITY: NEW CHIEF AT CLASSICAL STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russ Haberle has been named vice president-general manager of KFSD-FM (94.1), 
San Diego's only commercial classical music station. He replaces Nancy 
Reynolds, who left to become general manager of Edens Broadcasting's KOY-AM and 
Y95-FM in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
In his new position, Haberle is responsible for daily operations of the 
station, which is owned by Lotus Communications Corp. in Los Angeles and has a 
staff of 25. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old La Mesa resident has been with KFSD in various capacities for 
12 years. He joined the staff in 1977 as an account executive. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been intrigued by radio," Haberle said. "I grew up in Chicago, 
which is a great radio market. . . . went to Southern Illinois University, 
which has a very good broadcast department, specially geared toward sales and 
marketing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, after two years as the station's sales manager, Haberle transferred to 
Tucson, where he was vice president-general manager of KTKT-AM and KLPX-FM, 
also owned by Lotus Communications. He returned to KFSD as station manager in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Haberle calls his promotion as general manager his dream job. "My first job out 
of college was with KFSD, and ever since it has always been my dream to run 
this station." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled that the company has given me the opportunity to run one of the 
finest classical stations in the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not at the station, Haberle plays basketball and swims. He is a past 
vice president of the San Diego AdClub and continues to be active in the 
advertising community. 
</P>
<P>
KFSD went on the air with its classical music format in the late 1920s and has 
remained San Diego's only full-time, commercial classical music station.

CARVING OUT A NICHE IN UPSCALE EDIBLES; 
</P>
<P>
GOURMET GROCERY STORES FIND THEY APPEAL TO RANGE OF SHOPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some call it yuppie food, others describe it as good, wholesome food that costs 
a little bit more. Whatever the description, a growing number of stores are 
competing for consumers who will spend a bit more for upscale food items and 
better service. 
</P>
<P>
Often called ranch markets or specialty or gourmet stores, the relatively small 
establishments offer a wealth of fantastically fresh fruit, specially cut 
meats, alluring beverages and tastefully displayed foods that are decidedly 
high-end. 
</P>
<P>
Even the area's largest grocery stores have discovered that some customers -- 
and not just upscale ones -- will spend a bit more for service and quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Have Failed 
</P>
<P>
That discovery comes despite the failure of Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, which 
last year entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and Christian's, another 
Orange County-based farmers market chain that has been dogged by growth-related 
financial problems. (The former Irvine Ranch market in Horton Plaza continues 
to operate under new ownership.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's still an attractive business for people, an easily identifiable niche," 
said Sarah Stack, an industry analyst with Bateman, Eichler, Hill Richards in 
Los Angeles. "But a lot of companies fail on the basis of execution. They're 
not able to make money, given the relatively high labor costs." 
</P>
<P>
"Service is the distinguishing factor, along with quality," Stack said. "It's a 
competitive business and growing more so because more people are entering the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
"Irvine was undercapitalized, and they tried to expand way too fast," said Gene 
Kemp, general manager of Fashion Valley shopping center in Mission Valley, 
which in the past has considered adding an upscale food market. "But there's a 
need for these type of (outlets) throughout the county, and not just in the 
affluent areas." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have the personnel to help you run them, and you can't open them 
too fast," said Gilio Mattera, a retail food store veteran who, along with John 
Bolinger, owns the Harvest Ranch Markets in El Cajon and Encinitas. A third 
store will open soon in Renaissance Town Centre, a shopping plaza in the Golden 
Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Years to Make a Go 
</P>
<P>
"With any location you go into, it will take a couple of years to get 
established," said Mattera, who co-owned a small, San Diego-based food store 
chain that merged into the local Big Bear grocery chain nearly 20 years ago. 
"You're kidding yourself if you expect to go into a location and turn a profit 
the first year, because it takes two years to get off the ground in this 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike full-service grocery stores that sell everything from brooms to can 
openers, specialty stores typically sell only items that customers can eat or 
drink. The markets are also smaller than full-scale grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Harvest Ranch's stores are 12,000 square feet or smaller, and Daniel's Market, 
which will open later this month in Del Mar Plaza, will have only 9,000 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the smallish stores can have magnetic personalities. 
</P>
<P>
"They attract the locals," Kemp said, "but they also attract people who will 
drive 10 and 15 miles. They're (going to grow) in the future because there's a 
certain element that wants to buy the things they have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saying No to Hormones 
</P>
<P>
That is the case at Greentree, a Clairemont-area store that often attracts 
shoppers from as far away as Orange County and El Centro, according to Tom 
Adams, president of Greentree Gourmet Grocers, a partnership that in July 
purchased the 11-year-old store. 
</P>
<P>
Greentree, which plans to open two more stores, features organically grown 
produce, chemical- and hormone-free beef and a wide selection of vitamins. "We 
have gourmet natural foods," Adams said. "That is the accurate way to describe 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The company hopes to open a second store, in the La Mesa-El Cajon area in about 
six months. A third location is planned for North County. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial problems that entrapped the Orange County-based ranch 
markets, Mattera and others believe that specialty grocery stores can prosper 
if they stick to their niches. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't carry everything," Mattera said. "But we can get our share of the 
market. . . . We're not doing anything more than what the textbook calls upon 
us to do. We've got a nice, lean operation and we treat people with a smile." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catering to Both 
</P>
<P>
When Daniel's Market opens later this month, the shelves will be lined with 
upscale produce, meats and beverages. But the store also will cater to nearby 
homeowners who simply need a roll of waxed paper or a box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a market that would serve the residents of Del Mar," said David 
Winkler, a general partner in the firm that developed Del Mar Plaza. "We wanted 
to have a unique market, but we never intended to have one which would have the 
high prices associated with the gourmet market." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to stock both upscale and down-to-earth items was made several 
years ago after local residents protested that Del Mar's downtown, which has no 
grocery or convenience stores, didn't need another retail plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler and his partner, Ivan Gayler, thought they'd found the perfect 
market-style store in 1987 when they contracted with Christian's, an Orange 
County-based farmers market chain. But the chain was soon bogged down in 
financial problems similar to those that felled Irvine Ranch, industry 
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler and Gayler subsequently teamed up with Daniel Vengler, a longtime 
grocery operator who owns Sun Valley Market in Ramona, Village Station Market 
in La Mesa and Alpine Creek Market in Alpine. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to competing with each other for customers, the specialty grocers 
face competition at the other end of the spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the groceries have a Price Club image with massive displays and 
warehouse shelving," Mattera said. "They try to put the gourmet section at the 
other end of the store, but I don't know if you can do it all, because a lot of 
people don't want to go to a 60,000-square-foot store." 
</P>
<P>
"The major chains are putting in bulk food bins, salad bars and the like," 
Winkler said. "They're tending to pick up on things, so you have a certain 
degree of competitiveness with Vons and Big Bear."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: LRJ PRESIDENT INCREASES STAKE IN CALNETICS CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of LRJ Enterprises, a Chatsworth management-services firm, raised 
his stake in Calnetics Corp. to 17.1%, or 473,574 shares, from 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Larry D. Sacks 
said his Calnetics holdings increased following Calnetics' purchase of 
Chatsworth-based Manchester Plastics Co. on Sept. 18. Sacks held stock in both 
companies before the merger.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;

<P>
CHAMBER SOCIETY GETS JUMP ON SOVIET MUSIC OFFERINGS 
</P>

<P>
The La Jolla Chamber Music Society will get a jump on the Soviet Arts Festival 
on Friday by presenting the Moscow Virtuosi two weeks before the mayor's arts 
party begins. Performing at the Civic Theatre, the acclaimed chamber 
orchestra's 30 musicians will endeavor to repeat the favorable impression they 
made here two years ago on their first American tour. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla chamber sponsored the Moscow Virtuosi's 1987 visit and was 
sufficiently impressed to ask the group back to open the society's 1989-90 
International Orchestra series, extending the offer a year before the festival 
was announced. In March, the series will bring the Orchestre National de France 
under Lorin Maazel and, in June, will present the Philadelphia Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of concertmaster Vladimir Spivakov, Moscow Virtuosi's 
founder and director, the ensemble will play a varied program of J. S. Bach, 
Rossini, Vivaldi and a single Russian offering, Shostakovich's C Minor Chamber 
Symphony, which is actually a transcription for string orchestra of the 
composer's brilliant String Quartet No. 8. With violinist Arkady Futer, 
Spivakov will solo in Bach's D Minor Concerto for Two Violins, BWV 1043. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Virtuosi started its five-week American tour Sunday in St. Paul, 
(Minn., and will perform tonight in Costa Mesa and Wednesday in Pasadena. 
Unlike many touring orchestras, the Moscow musicians do not take just one or 
two programs on the road. They have about 20 works in this season's touring 
repertory, which means that, of the dozen pieces they will perform in Southern 
California, only three will be played more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Multimedia allegory. Janos Negesy is UC San Diego's violinist for all seasons. 
His appetite spans John Cage's recent 80-minute "Freeman" Etudes and obscure 
concertos by Ernst Krenek to the standard chamber music morsels he turns out in 
his "Soiree for Music Lovers" series. This Friday at UCSD's Center for Music 
Experiment, Negesy will unveil "Aura," a work for electronic violin, computer 
and kinetic sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Thiem's 7-foot metal sculpture, "Sisyphus," will interact with the 
electronic violin and computer program to create a sonic montage titled "Aura." 
Alluding to its namesake myth, Thiem's sculpture is a wire-frame globe with a 
small motorized cart that slowly ascends its side, only to roll back to its 
original position. 
</P>
<P>
"The sculpture makes pings and crackles when it moves," explained computer 
operator Lee Ray, "and has a contact mike on it that picks up the sounds, which 
are then sustained and processed by the violin." 
</P>
<P>
Processing, altering and mixing sounds is composer Ray's forte, especially as 
he plays Boswell to Negesy's Johnson. According to Ray, although the work has a 
core identity and certain recognized contours, it will never be the same twice 
because of the interaction of the components. 
</P>
<P>
"Janos never knows exactly what I am going to do at the computer," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
Not just French horn. When Murry Sidlin, popular guest conductor with the San 
Diego Symphony, last breezed into town, he had some compliments for the 
orchestra's assistant principal horn player, Ethan Dulsky. The kudos, however, 
were not for Dulsky's slick brass licks, but for his conducting prowess at this 
summer's Aspen Music Festival. Sidlin is one of the festival's regular 
conducting coaches, and Dulsky was one of the aspiring conducting candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"A few people seemed to be quite promising, including Dulsky, who was 
expressive and serious on the podium," Sidlin said. He lamented the music 
industry's infatuation with young, hot-shot conductors. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a world where, if you haven't conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra 
at age 26, you're not taken seriously. It used to be that you didn't hear a 
conductor before the age of 50, when the conductor had thoroughly digested all 
the elements of his craft." 
</P>
<P>
Truth in advertising. Lynn Schuette, executive director of downtown's Sushi 
Performance Gallery, deserves a special award for rising above the hype and 
self-congratulatory promotion that seems endemic to arts directors. In her 
introductory program note to Sushi's 10th season, Schuette wrote with unusual 
candor, "As we all know, art can be transcendent or cloying, riveting or 
trivial, profound or boring. All has been presented at Sushi in the attempt to 
give artists a voice."

Speaking of reunions, it will be just like the old days, sort of, when the 
Jefferson Airplane plays a free concert in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park 
Saturday, with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir as opening act. Admission will be 
one can of food, to be donated to the San Francisco Food Bank. But 
demonstrating how some things have changed in the 20 years since free concerts 
in the park were the norm in Frisco, a local radio station has had to take out 
a $1-million insurance policy to cover the event. Producer Bill Graham, who has 
staged many a concert -- free and otherwise -- with the Airplane and the Dead, 
estimates a draw of 50,000 people. ALEENE MacMINN

TWO GERMANYS TRADE CHARGES OVER REFUGEES

<P>
East Germany and West Germany exchanged accusations of bad faith Monday over 
their negotiations that allowed more than 6,000 East Germans to go to West 
Germany from Czechoslovakia and Poland over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, East German refugees continued to crowd into West Germany's 
embassies in Prague and Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall Monday, more than 1,000 new would-be emigrants from East Germany 
were reported to have entered the West German Embassy compound in Prague. About 
5,000 had been there before Saturday's surprise exodus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent to Guest Houses 
</P>
<P>
About 150 East Germans made their way into the West German Embassy in Warsaw, 
where they were registered and sent off to guest houses on the outskirts of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist government of East Germany said in East Berlin that the Bonn 
government had broken its promise to close its embassies in Prague and Warsaw 
in order to keep additional East Germans from flooding in. 
</P>
<P>
The official East German news agency ADN said that East Germany had "resolutely 
protested" that West Germany, after promising to halt the influx, was instead 
allowing additional refugees to enter its embassies. 
</P>
<P>
An East German official, Horst Neubauer, was quoted as calling Bonn's action "a 
gross breach of trust." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers here think the East Germans now believe that their 
"humanitarian gesture" in allowing their citizens to leave for the West may 
have backfired. ADN said that Neubauer, the East German official, was insisting 
that the new East German refugees in Prague and Warsaw "be ejected and returned 
to East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
In reply, Juergen Chrobog of the West German Foreign Ministry denied that any 
deal had been made to close his government's embassies as part of the agreement 
to allow those already in Prague and Warsaw to go by special train to West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hans Klein, chief spokesman for the West German government, said 
that Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been "in constant contact" with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev concerning the refugees crisis, which has soured 
East-West relations in Bonn, East Berlin, Prague, Warsaw and Budapest. He 
offered no details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6,300 Left Saturday 
</P>
<P>
In the agreement reached between the two Germanys, about 6,300 East Germans 
were allowed to board trains in Prague and Warsaw late Saturday and to proceed 
through East Germany to reception centers in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Chrobog, the West German Foreign Ministry official, said the embassy in Prague 
was closed for a time Sunday because extensive renovation was needed after the 
thousands of East Germans had been living in the buildings and on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It is in an appalling state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But when additional scores of East Germans started showing up, he said, "it 
broke our heart not to let them in. We could not leave them standing outside." 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, Chrobog said, "it is West German policy that any German 
citizen turning up at a West German embassy for help will be helped." West 
Germany recognizes only a single German citizenship, which entitles an 
individual, whether from the east or west, access to Bonn's missions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
East German Anger 
</P>
<P>
Chrobog's statement was sure to anger the East German government. Its citizens 
need no special documents to travel to Czechoslovakia, and Prague, which is 
only about 60 miles from the East German frontier, could continue to be an 
unofficial exit point for East Germans headed for West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The area around the West German Embassy in Prague was clogged with cars 
abandoned by East Germans seeking asylum in the embassy compound. Other East 
Germans, burdened with suitcases, hiked through Prague on Monday looking for 
the embassy. Their numbers grew as trains arrived from East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We are losing the equivalent of a village a day," an East German official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the refugee crisis, which began in May when Hungary opened its frontier 
with Austria, threatens to spoil the long-planned celebration of the 40th 
anniversary of the founding of the East German state on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials said they told the Czechoslovak government in a protest 
filed Monday that the police in Prague should not try to prevent East Germans 
from entering the grounds of the West German Embassy there. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, police seized two men trying to get into the embassy. Both 
were released after a West German diplomat intervened and escorted them into 
the compound through the front gate. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before that, police were seen beating and grabbing at four East German 
youths trying to get into the compound through the rear garden. But by 
afternoon, refugees could walk in through the front gate. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government asked East Germany to allow the 1,000 East Germans who 
entered the embassy in Prague on Monday to join those who were allowed to 
proceed to the West. It said in a statement issued by Rudolf Seiters of the 
chancellery that only a change for the better in the Communist regime could 
stem the flow of emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that East Germany has made the basic decision on letting refugees leave, I 
would like to ask it to deal with this problem as well," Seiters declared. "The 
East German leadership must recognize that it must change course if its young 
people are not to run away." 
</P>
<P>
The East German regime has called East Germans who fled to the West 
"irresponsible, anti-social, criminals and traitors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
East German Offer Stands 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, special negotiator Wolfgang Vogel said the offer he extended 
last week still holds: If the East Germans in West German missions return home, 
they will be guaranteed legal emigration within six months. 
</P>
<P>
But few appeared to be heeding his words. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia and Poland, like Hungary earlier, are caught in a dilemma: They 
have signed treaties with East Germany that commit them to refuse to allow East 
Germans to exit without credentials, but at the same time they do not want to 
offend West Germany, a major trading partner and supplier of economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union appears to be opposed to the East German position. It has 
called on East German leader Erich Honecker to undertake Soviet-style reforms. 
</P>
<P>
In this light, Western diplomats believe, Soviet President Gorbachev's 
scheduled visit to East Berlin on Friday and Saturday promises to be tense.

2 DRUGS COMBINED CUT COLON CANCER FATALITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
New research shows that a combination of two drugs given after surgery 
substantially reduces the death rate for patients with advanced colon cancer, 
the National Cancer Institute announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major advance," Dr. Samuel Broder, director of the cancer institute, 
said at a press conference. "The results suggest we might be able to reduce the 
death rate by as much as one-third." 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials said the findings are so compelling that researchers 
have decided to discontinue comparison portions of the studies in which 
patients are under observation only with no drug therapy, and will urge those 
patients to consider taking the combination drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Alerted 
</P>
<P>
Also, Broder said, the cancer institute has alerted 35,000 physicians, surgeons 
and major institutions treating cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged about this," said Joanne Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the 
American Cancer Society. "There is definitely a need for more armaments in the 
war against advanced colon cancer." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, an estimated 107,000 new cases of colon cancer are expected. Excluding 
common skin cancers, the combined incidence of colon and rectum cancer -- 
estimated at a total of 151,000 new cases this year -- is second only to lung 
cancer in this country. About 53,500 colon cancer deaths are expected this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The studies used levamisole, a drug that has been available in this country 
only to veterinarians for the treatment of intestinal worms, and 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU), a well-known anti-cancer drug for more than 30 years. The drugs were 
started three to five weeks after surgery and given for one year to colon 
cancer patients whose cancer had spread to the adjacent lymph nodes, an 
advanced stage of colon cancer known as Dukes' C. About 21,000 people will be 
diagnosed this year with Dukes' C colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In one study, 49% of the patients were alive five years after therapy, 
contrasted with only 37% of those who received no further treatment after 
surgery, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, 408 patients with Dukes' B -- an earlier stage -- or Dukes' C 
colon cancer were randomly chosen to receive either observation only after 
surgery, levamisole alone or the combination drug therapy. Compared to the 
post-surgical observation-only group, the patients who received both levamisole 
and 5-FU had "significantly fewer" tumor recurrences after five years, 55% 
versus 41%. In cases that did recur, those using the drug combination had 
longer delays before recurrence -- 23 months versus 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the combination therapy on Dukes' B colon cancer were inconclusive, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Patients Not Helped 
</P>
<P>
Also, the treatment is of no benefit to patients whose cancer has spread beyond 
the lymph nodes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The study was sponsored by the cancer institute and conducted by the North 
Central Cancer Treatment Group, under the direction of Dr. Charles G. Moertel, 
a cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The findings were 
reported in the current Journal of Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we can come to you with great confidence and tell you we have a 
treatment of value," said Moertel, who was at the press conference. "I feel any 
patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if they are 
not offered this treatment opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A second, larger study that confirms these findings is expected to be published 
shortly "and provides data to suggest a one-third reduction in the cancer death 
rate at about 3 1/2 years" after surgery, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
This study, also sponsored by the cancer institute, used 1,296 patients between 
1984 and 1987, and, like the earlier study, showed that the two drugs taken in 
combination "reduced recurrence rates, delayed onset of tumor relapse and 
improved disease-free and overall survival for Dukes' C patients," the 
scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that levamisole used alone showed little benefit and that the 
combination therapy has not yet shown any value in other stages of colon 
cancer, or as a treatment for rectum cancer. 
</P>
<P>
5-FU has already shown some benefit in patients with digestive system cancers. 
Levamisole has been used for the past 20 years as a treatment for intestinal 
worms in humans and animals, although it is approved in this country only for 
use in animals. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, at the request of the cancer institute, the Food and Drug 
Administration approved the expanded use of levamisole for treating colon 
cancer under a mechanism known as a "treatment IND," for investigational new 
drug. The designation allows drug developers to release a potentially promising 
drug to desperately ill patients before it has been approved, and while 
research continues. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, made by Paul Janssen Co. of Belgium, will be available to U.S. cancer 
patients free through the National Cancer Institute until the FDA formally 
approves it for use in the treatment of colon cancer. 5-FU was developed by 
Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc. of Nutley, N.J.

The Supreme Court, acting Monday on nearly 1,000 appeals that had piled up over 
the summer, announced that it will rule on whether motorists may be stopped by 
the police at highway checkpoints to see if they are drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing use of sobriety checkpoints in many states, including 
California, the high court never has ruled directly on the constitutionality of 
routine police stops of presumably innocent motorists. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan courts in February called a halt to that state's sobriety 
checkpoint program on grounds that the effort, although "laudable," violated 
the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. The state 
attorney general appealed, arguing that such stops represent a reasonable 
response to the carnage caused by drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan appeal was among 22 that the justices agreed to hear Monday. The 
high court dismissed hundreds of appeals, leaving the lower court rulings 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
One of the day's most significant developments came in an off-hand announcement 
that Justice John Paul Stevens, who has voted in the past to protect the right 
to abortion from state regulation, would not participate in the pending 
Illinois abortion case. 
</P>
<P>
He did not explain his reasons, although in the past he has recused himself 
from cases involving law firms with which he has a personal or family 
connection. Stevens once practiced law in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The move by Stevens was a sharp setback for pro-choice advocates. They had 
hoped that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the swing vote on abortion, might be 
persuaded to join Stevens and three other justices to produce a 5-4 ruling that 
Illinois and the other states may not impose regulations on abortion clinics 
that are costly and medically unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Illinois case is viewed by legal experts as the most significant of the 
three pending abortion appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled last July that states may ban abortion in public facilities, 
and critics of the Illinois law say that it is designed to drive private 
abortion clinics out of business. However, lawyers for Illinois say that the 
law is merely intended to ensure quality medical care in abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Without Stevens, about the best the abortion-rights advocates probably can hope 
for is a 4-4 split. That would uphold the Illinois appeals court ruling, which 
threw out the Illinois law as unconstitutional. But it would have no impact 
beyond the immediate Illinois law and would not establish a national precedent. 
</P>
<P>
If O'Connor votes with the four other justices who voted last July to let 
states ban abortion in public facilities, the ruling would reinstate the 
Illinois law and leave other legislatures free to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
The case (Turnock vs. Ragsdale, 88-790) will be argued before the court on Dec. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan case on sobriety checkpoints (Michigan vs. Sitz, 88-1897) will be 
heard early next year. Just before the Christmas holidays last year, the 
justices let stand a California Supreme Court ruling permitting sobriety 
checkpoints. But, in that case, the court merely denied an appeal and did not 
rule on the merits of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the high court has developed what many experts view as a 
confusing two-track analysis of search and seizures cases. When a search is 
criminal in nature, police must show some "reasonable suspicion" before 
stopping and questioning an individual. However, if the search is labeled 
"administrative," officials may search anyone. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of "administrative" searches began with the inspections of 
businesses for fire code violations and other non-criminal activities. Searches 
at the U.S. border are considered "administrative," and cars and passengers may 
be routinely inspected even though agents have no reason to suspect wrongdoing. 
Likewise, airport searches of passengers and baggage are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
However, as defense lawyers have pointed out, sobriety checkpoints on the 
highway are closer to criminal searches. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most state courts, the Michigan Supreme Court analyzed the sobriety 
checkpoints as a type of criminal search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
"While the goals of the sobriety checkpoint program are laudable," the state 
court said, "the program fails to qualify as a reasonable seizure under the 
Fourth Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Made clear that the U.S. Interior secretary, not state governors, has the 
final word on selecting sites for offshore oil exploration. The court let stand 
a ruling (Cowper vs. U.S., 88-2000) from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
upholding the authority of federal officials to lease sites off the Alaska 
coast. The law allows governors to make "recommendations" but leaves the 
decision to the federal government, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, joined by seven others, said that the 
ruling leaves the states "virtually powerless" to block offshore drilling near 
their coastlines. The court rejected the appeal without dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand a $278,600 libel verdict against a Pawtucket, R. I., newspaper 
for a news story that contained no false statements (New England Newspapers vs. 
Healey, 88-1939). Rather, the Rhode Island Supreme Court said that the libel 
award was justified for "what was left unprinted." 
</P>
<P>
In reporting the sudden heart attack death of a local political activist 
outside a public meeting, the newspaper noted that the chairman of the meeting 
had been Dr. Paul Healey, a physician. This left the "defamatory implication" 
that the doctor should have come to the aid of the stricken man, the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether a government agency may take into account an 
employee's political affiliation in making promotions and transfers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the court dealt a blow to political patronage by ruling that public 
employees may not be fired solely for political reasons.

PANEL SUPPORTS TOUGHER RULES ON CAR EXHAUST

Key House members, reaching a compromise hailed as a "historic breakthrough" in 
the decade-long struggle to enact clean air legislation, agreed Monday to 
extend California's tough new auto emissions standards to the rest of the 
country over a two-year period starting in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, approved unanimously by the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and the environment, significantly tightens the controls 
that would be placed on smog-causing tailpipe emissions from cars and light 
trucks under President Bush's new clean air bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
39% Hydrocarbon Cut 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, it would lower the amount of hydrocarbons cars are allowed to 
emit by 39% from current levels and reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide, another 
component of smog, by 60%. The new standards go into effect in California in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise would also more strictly regulate the emissions of 
cancer-causing toxic chemicals from motor vehicles and would provide for a 
second round of even stricter emission reductions early in the 21st Century, 
should the Environmental Protection Agency determine that they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced by subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), the leading advocate of clean air legislation in the House. "For the 
first time in over a decade," Waxman said, there is "a broad agreement on a 
package of measures that will reduce pollution from cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"This amendment doesn't have every provision the environmentalists wanted and 
it has more controls than the auto makers wanted . . . . But when it's looked 
at as a whole, I think almost everyone will agree that it's balanced, fair, 
tough and will bring effective and sensible reductions in air pollution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reactions Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Reactions to the agreement, which was amended to the Bush bill by a 22-0 vote, 
were predictably mixed, with environmentalists praising it as "a significant 
step forward" toward effective clean air legislation and auto company spokesmen 
denouncing it as a biased measure that saddles their industry with an unfair 
share of the burden for cleaning up the nation's dirty air. 
</P>
<P>
"We supported the President's original proposal as a valuable contribution to 
improving air quality, although it would have put a severe strain on our human 
and technological resources, but this action goes well beyond that," Harold A. 
Poling, vice chairman and chief operating officer of the Ford Motor Co., said. 
</P>
<P>
Poling contended that there is no need to apply California emission standards 
-- which are the strictest in the country -- nationwide because "those 
standards are tailored to California's unique problems" with smog. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, however, Deputy Press Secretary Stephen Hart said the 
California standards, although tougher than the President proposed, are "really 
not too far away from ours. 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad to see that they're using our model." He said the White House would 
"have to see what comes out" of the committee before commenting further. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bush bill still has a number of legislative hurdles to overcome 
before it can become law, the compromise crafted on Monday -- after a marathon 
round of day-and-night negotiations on Saturday and Sunday -- was hailed by 
several legislators as a "landmark" achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the lawmakers' euphoria was the fact that the agreement represented 
a reconciliation between the two principal protagonists in the clean air battle 
in the House -- Waxman and Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee chairman, who represents a district in the Detroit area. 
Although they have worked together amicably on other issues in the past, Waxman 
and Dingell have been fierce antagonists on clean air issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have sooner believed that Henry Waxman had been elected to the board 
of the National Rifle Assn. and John Dingell to the board of Greenpeace," said 
Rep. Gerry Sikorski (D-Minn.), expressing his surprise at the agreement reached 
between the two adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Henry Waxman and Chairman Dingell in the same room together," said 
Rep. Michael Bilirakis (R-Fla.), "then, well, I knew the Earth had moved." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the compromise apparently was Waxman's agreement to language that 
would allow the EPA administrator to "opt out," in one committee member's 
phrase, from the need to impose a second round of deep emission cuts after the 
year 2000. Dingell and other pro-industry legislators had complained that the 
second round of cuts were unnecessary and technologically unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, the EPA and the congressional Office of Technology 
Assessment will be required to complete a study on the need for further 
requirements by June 1, 1997. The EPA administrator will have the discretion 
then to impose new standards no later than model year 2006. In the event the 
administrator does nothing, Waxman's original proposals for future cuts will 
take effect by default on Jan. 1, 2003. 
</P>
<P>
In return for this concession, Dingell agreed to strengthen the Bush bill 
considerably by accepting the more stringent California emissions standards. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell also won a slight reprieve for auto makers by stretching Waxman's 
deadlines for compliance with the new standards. Although the California 
standards take effect in 1993, they would not begin to apply to the rest of the 
nation until the next year, when they would be phased in over a two-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell acknowledged that the auto industry is unenthusiastic about the 
compromise but he called the agreement fair. Dingell and Waxman said they had 
agreed to support the compromise "all the way" and would resist attempts to 
strengthen or dilute it with other amendments.

KISSINGER SAYS TO BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE INDIAN LEADER DESAI WAS NOT CIA AGENT 
</P>

<P>
Testifying in court for the first time about national security matters, former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger told a jury Monday that while he never 
knew the names of intelligence sources, "to the best of my knowledge" former 
Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai was not a CIA agent. 
</P>
<P>
But in carefully measured testimony, Kissinger never said, unequivocally, that 
Desai was not an agent. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger's unprecedented federal court appearance came in a libel suit Desai 
filed against journalist Seymour Hersh for assertions in his 1983 book, "The 
Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House." In a chapter dealing with 
India, Hersh wrote that Desai was a paid CIA agent who provided information on 
plans and policies of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's 
Administration in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks $100 Million in Damages 
</P>
<P>
Desai, now 94 and in poor health in Bombay, called Hersh's report "a scandalous 
and malicious lie." The former Indian politician, who also served as finance 
minister and deputy prime minister, is asking for $100 million in damages 
claiming the book brands him as a traitor to India. 
</P>
<P>
Hersh, who won a 1970 Pulitzer Prize for disclosing the My Lai massacre during 
the Vietnam War, sat quietly, eyes fixed on Kissinger. Hersh, who has written 
extensively on the American intelligence community, maintains that he has 
multiple confidential sources for his claim and believed the information was 
true when he wrote the chapter. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Norgle ruled last week that Hersh did not have 
to reveal his sources. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes testy and sometimes witty, Kissinger was a reluctant witness who had 
fought the subpoena served on him two weeks ago when he was giving a speech to 
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. Outside the courtroom, he told 
reporters that he had an agreement with lawyers that if he gave a deposition in 
the case, he would not have to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not eager to testify," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, who was accompanied by his wife, Nancy, said this was only his 
second time he had ever appeared in court. The first time, he said, he was a 
witness for Mrs. Kissinger, who was accused of assaulting a supporter of 
political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche at an airport terminal. She was 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
In court Kissinger discussed information the United States received in the days 
leading up to the 1971 India-East Pakistan war that led to the formation of the 
new country of Bangladesh and acknowledged that there was reliable information 
coming from within the Indian government. 
</P>
<P>
Before giving his deposition in the case, Kissinger said he checked with former 
CIA director Richard Helms. Kissinger, responding to a question by Hersh's 
lawyer, Bernard Nussbaum, said he told Helms that "to the best of my belief Mr. 
Desai was not an agent. And he (Helms) said, 'you are on safe ground saying 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Desai's lawyer, Cyriac Kappil, asked Kissinger if he ever had a reason to 
believe Desai was an agent in 1969, '70 and '71, Kissinger said: "I have no 
such reason to believe that." 
</P>
<P>
The former national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon and 
secretary of state under both Presidents Nixon and Gerald R. Ford could not, 
however, identify names of sources of information. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never briefed as to names, but we were briefed as to categories," 
Kissinger said. However, he said that he could not discuss what those 
"categories" were. "That gets us into classified areas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attests to Unknown Sources 
</P>
<P>
But Kissinger also testified that the U.S. did have sources unknown to him who 
were providing high-level intelligence from within the Indian government. 
</P>
<P>
After his three hours on the witness stand, Kissinger told reporters that he 
too considered filing a libel suit against Hersh after reading portions of the 
book but decided against it because of the time that it would take. And he said 
he hoped this was his last association with the journalist. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be just as happy if I never heard of Mr. Hersh again," Kissinger said. 
"I'm not looking for an opportunity to prove points against Mr. Hersh. Frankly, 
the quicker he goes out of my life the happier I'll be." 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last several more days. 
</P>
<P>
Desai's lawyers filed their suit in Chicago citing a tradition of filing 
defamation actions in the home town of the defendant. While he was born in 
Chicago, Hersh no longer lives here.

FIERY COUNCIL PRESIDENT LEADS PACK FOR MAYORAL PRIMARY IN CLEVELAND

It's been a while since George Forbes has thrown a chair at anyone. He doesn't 
curse much in public anymore, either. And the volatile City Council president 
has put an apparent moratorium on manhandling reporters. 
</P>
<P>
George Forbes is running for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial Forbes, whose explosive temper is almost as legendary here as 
his daunting political power, is cleaning up his act. He is seeking to 
legitimize what nearly everyone concedes has been his longstanding role as "the 
man who runs City Hall." In doing so, however, he is taking a risk. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthy black attorney is the acknowledged front-runner in today's 
nonpartisan primary, in which he faces four other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
But despite Cleveland's status in the 1960s as one of the first major cities to 
elect a black mayor, and despite a population that is almost evenly divided 
between blacks and whites, there has not been a serious black mayoral candidate 
here in years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough to Attract Whites 
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake about it," said Gerald Austin, a Forbes campaign consultant. 
"Cleveland is racially divided." Winning white voters will be Forbes' toughest 
task. 
</P>
<P>
The two top vote-getters will face each other in the November general election. 
Until recently, the primary almost seemed like two distinct playoffs, with 
black East Siders choosing a champion who would face a white West Sider in the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
But black state Sen. Michael R. White, who was endorsed by the Cleveland Plain 
Dealer as "easily the standout mayoral candidate," has been gaining on Forbes. 
A poll in Sunday's Plain Dealer showed Forbes leading with 23% and White in 
second place with 16%. 
</P>
<P>
White calls the city a "racial powder keg." Whenever Forbes has accused an 
opponent or the news media of racism, White has been quick to denounce him for 
using race as a tactic. 
</P>
<P>
The white front-runner has been Benny Bonanno, the 39-year-old Municipal Court 
clerk who has held five elected offices, including state representative and 
city councilman. He has been accused by opponents of caring more about winning 
elections than serving in office, but he has a solid base of white ethnic 
voters who respond passionately to his stands against busing and for 
neighborhood development. 
</P>
<P>
He also has made inroads into the black community by winning the allegiance of 
several influential blacks. 
</P>
<P>
His chief opponent for white votes is Cuyahoga County Commissioner Timothy F. 
Hagan, a friend of the Kennedy clan who, despite the lack of a broad voter base 
in the city, has waged an aggressive media campaign. His television commercials 
have sought to keep the spotlight on two major scandals that involved Bonanno 
and Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
One commercial rips into Forbes for his unwavering support of a controversial 
police operation that allowed a white drug dealer to sell half a million 
dollars' worth of uncut cocaine in the black community. The money was then 
allowed to vanish into the Miami drug pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Although this all was done to set up a sting that eventually netted 46 
kilograms of cocaine, the operation drew harsh criticism from a number of black 
officials and is being investigated by the Justice Department. Forbes, however, 
said the police should be given medals of honor. 
</P>
<P>
Another Hagan commercial criticizes Bonanno for writing a letter of 
recommendation in 1983 urging an early prison release for a mobster who had 
previously done time for killing two Cleveland policemen. 
</P>
<P>
The third white candidate, School Board President Ralph J. Perk Jr., is the son 
of a former mayor and was a late entry into the race. 
</P>
<P>
Clevelanders have spent the last relatively calm and prosperous 10 years under 
Republican Mayor George Voinovich, who is now running for governor, trying to 
forget the disappointments and embarrassments that have beset the city since 
the 1960s. There was the day in 1969 that the oil-smeared Cayahoga River, which 
runs through downtown, caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the mayors who Fortune magazine said "seemed to have 
stepped out of a Three Stooges movie." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Perk Sr., mayor from 1971 to 1977, is remembered mostly for his fiscal 
policies that set the city on the road to bankruptcy and for setting his hair 
on fire while trying to cut a metal ribbon at a bridge opening with an 
acetylene torch. He was succeeded by the pugnacious Dennis Kucinich, the 
populist "boy mayor" who battled mightily against big business interests while 
the city drifted inexorably into default. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Forbes' opposition stems from worry that his frequent outbursts might 
also embarrass the city if he is elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Forbes has been council president for 16 years and has sat on 
the council for 26 years. Because of his domineering personality, his control 
of the city's purse strings as chairman of the council's Finance Committee and 
a succession of retiring or ineffectual mayors, Forbes emerged in the 1970s as 
the city's most powerful politician. 
</P>
<P>
"If people in Cleveland, especially whites, can put aside their racial 
prejudices and put aside the fact that (Forbes') personality irritates them -- 
which may be a big thing to ask -- they've got to acknowledge that he's the 
most experienced candidate," said Austin, the Forbes campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But Forbes' critics say he has used his office to increase his personal wealth 
and has sold out his constituency in favor of downtown business interests. As a 
result, they say, downtown is undergoing a renaissance while the neighborhoods 
continue to suffer. They also accuse him of using his control of government 
grants to win the allegiance of community groups and black churches, in effect 
co-opting black leaders who otherwise might oppose him.

RENTS DOUBLED AFTER PROJECT GOT BIG SUBSIDY; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE $31 MILLION IN FEDERAL AID, HOUSING SAID TO LOOK LIKE SLUM

<P>
A low-income housing project that got $31-million worth of federal 
rehabilitation subsidies through the political influence of a prominent 
Republican consultant has more than doubled its rents but still resembles a 
slum, congressional investigators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal funds for the Seabrook, N. J., development were supposed to be used to 
modernize and improve 57 structures originally built during World War II as 
temporary housing for farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, almost two years after rehabilitation work began, the 326 units 
provide no refrigerators for tenants, the buildings lack rain gutters or 
downspouts and the nearest laundry facilities are more than a half mile away 
over a dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cinder-Block Barracks' 
</P>
<P>
Investigators who visited the site found "row upon row of cinder-block barracks 
. . . water damage resulting from roof leakage, exposed electrical wiring and 
shoddy construction," according to Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of 
the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment, which 
is examining political favoritism at HUD. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate in the costly project is 20%, Lantos added. 
</P>
<P>
Paul J. Manafort, a former campaign adviser to President Bush who is now a 
partner in a high-powered lobbying firm, acknowledged in testimony Monday that 
he has never visited the development, which earned his company a fee of 
$326,000 for getting Department of Housing and Urban Development approval of 
the subsidies in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Manafort, who is also a 20% owner of the development company for the Seabrook 
units, said that federal tax credits from the project, which constitute an 
additional form of subsidy, already have been sold to investors for $3.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the promised rehabilitation is still not finished, and the project still 
does not have a single permanent occupancy permit from municipal authorities, 
Manafort and his partner, Victor Cruse, acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Under HUD's moderate rehabilitation program, rent subsidies totaling $31 
million will continue for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We played by the rules," Manafort said in defense of himself and his 
consulting firm, Black, Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly, and the way it obtained 
funding for the Seabrook development with the aid of Deborah Gore Dean, once a 
top assistant to former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lantos challenged Manafort's insistence that the $4.4 million put into 
the Seabrook development by the investors represented a sizable risk. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a sweetheart deal with Debbie Dean that was implemented and stands 
implemented," Lantos contended. "Nothing could be less risky than this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rents Up Sharply 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), Cruse said 
that rents at the development ranged from $250 to $300 a month before 
rehabilitation began in December, 1987, but since have been raised, ranging 
from $552 for a one-bedroom unit to $756 for a three-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of these increases would be paid by tax dollars. Federal law provides 
that tenants who meet the low-income requirements established by HUD have to 
pay only one-third of their income for rent, and the U.S. government picks up 
the remainder as part of the subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
Cruse, former deputy housing commissioner of Connecticut who became a partner 
of Manafort on the Seabrook development, said that the municipal government of 
Upper Deerfield, N. J., made its building codes more demanding during the 
rehabilitation work. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why the buildings did not have gutters and downspouts, which city 
officials insist be installed, Cruse replied: "We are presently putting them on 
. . . . The buildings survived 40 years without them." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the developers were under pressure to provide laundry 
facilities and improve the landscaping before the city would grant permanent 
occupancy permits. At present, he said, 182 of the 326 units have temporary 
permits, but he estimated that the rest would be ready for rental by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N. Y.) said that low-income tenants could have had much 
better housing for the $31 million committed by HUD for the Seabrook 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"We find an extremely alarming situation," Weiss said. "The biggest profits go 
to consultants and developers and, when they get through -- it (the housing) is 
scandalous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admits Using Clout 
</P>
<P>
Manafort, who acknowledged that the political clout of his firm had helped get 
the HUD money for the project that he later joined others in buying, dissented 
when Weiss termed his operations influence-peddling. 
</P>
<P>
"You might call it influence-peddling. I call it lobbying," he said. "That's a 
definitional debate." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) asserted: "Seabrook was a bum deal . . . . 
Probably most of what happened at HUD is probably not illegal, but something 
about it just smells."

Inernationally acclaimed violinist Eugene Fodor, charged with breaking and 
entering and possession of cocaine and heroin, was placed on probation Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I'm relieved that this ordeal is over," Fodor said. "The experience 
has been a frightening and profound one. What I want to do now is get back to 
my music and my life." 
</P>
<P>
Fodor, 39, of New York City, pleaded guilty to breaking into the Martha's 
Vineyard motel room where he was discovered July 27. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the room turned up a bottle containing more than 20 grams of 
cocaine, a hypodermic needle with a small amount of heroin and a dagger. 
</P>
<P>
A Dukes County Grand Jury had returned indictments of breaking and entering, 
possession of heroin and cocaine and possession of instruments used to 
administer drugs. Fodor pleaded guilty to the breaking-and-entering charge, 
which carried a maximum penalty of six months in jail. Fodor pleaded innocent 
to the other charges, and they were placed on file, pending his completion of 
probation.

MEXICO CHIEF ASKS LOCAL TOUCH ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>

Mexico and the United States, instead of dealing with immigration policy almost 
entirely at the federal level, must consult more with local governments and 
labor unions as part of a renewed effort to bring order to the massive flow of 
people across the borders of the two countries, Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to have the Mexican and U.S. governments work directly with local 
governments and labor unions on the border-crossing problem have been debated 
by academics in both countries in the past and have been suggested as an 
alternative to the present immigration system by Jorge Bustamante, director of 
the Mexican Center for the Study of the Northern Border in Tijuana, a 
government agency. 
</P>
<P>
But this was the first time that a senior Mexican political leader has embraced 
the approach. Under such a system, farmers in the United States presumably 
would be permitted to go into Mexican communities and work with local officials 
and labor unions in arranging for migrant workers to enter this country and 
work on American farms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Rules 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, in Washington for a series of meetings on bilateral issues with 
President Bush and other Administration officials, noted that the thousands of 
Mexican migrant workers who cross the border -- part of 22 million border 
crossings a year -- now are subject to a series of immigration rules in both 
countries that compound an already complex situation. 
</P>
<P>
He brought up the idea during an hourlong session with a small group of U.S. 
reporters at Blair House, the official guest house across the street from the 
White House, where he is staying during his Washington visit. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Salinas also declared that the recent seizure of 20 tons 
of cocaine in Los Angeles shows that drug traffickers have been having great 
success smuggling the illegal drug through Mexico to the United States and that 
it demonstrates the need for closer cooperation between the two countries in 
the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It worries me very much . . . because it shows that very much cocaine is 
passing through Mexico and too much is entering the U.S.," he said. "That's why 
I have decided we must strengthen cooperation. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information on Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Salinas said that the problem will be "one of the main topics that I will talk 
to the President and his Administration about -- the strengthening of 
relations, cooperation on drug trafficking, especially with relation to 
information, because I have said that the responsibility of finding drug 
traffickers in Mexico is not solely within the Mexican means." 
</P>
<P>
But in answer to a question, he said that he cannot see Mexico ever agreeing to 
permit U.S. law enforcement agents to cross Mexico's borders in "hot pursuit" 
of drug suspects. "No, that will never happen," said Salinas, who is known to 
feel strongly that such a practice would threaten Mexico's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Although stressing the need for changing the two countries' systems for 
handling border crossings, Salinas said that the Mexican economy's need to 
provide more jobs for Mexicans is another factor that figures heavily in 
discussions about ways to deal with the huge outflow of migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Million Jobs Needed 
</P>
<P>
Mexico needs to create a million new jobs a year and that is the goal he has 
set for next year, said Salinas, who is nearing the end of his first year of a 
six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
He called for the United States to lower trade barriers on textiles, steel, 
automobiles and other products and said that free trade would increase 
employment substantially and provide "jobs for Mexicans in Mexico and not in 
the U.S." He said that Mexico has unilaterally opened its markets and the 
United States should now lift its own trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas and Bush are expected to sign several agreements covering such subjects 
as border issues, expanded trade and investment, tourism and pollution control 
when they meet at the White House today. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, told 
reporters that both countries hope the agreements will be instrumental in 
"opening the Mexican market for investment." But he declined to discuss details 
of the agreements.

U.S. AND SOVIET DEFENSE CHIEFS MEET AT PENTAGON FOR 1ST TIME 
</P>

<P>
U.S. and Soviet defense chiefs met in Washington for the first time ever 
Monday, engaging in a broad discussion of superpower military doctrine and 
defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov 
exchanged information on how defense policy is made in their respective 
countries, military strategy and doctrine and defense budgets and production, 
according to U.S. officials who attended the sessions at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
But the significance of the talks was not in their content, which was broad but 
not deep, officials said. The defense chiefs did not negotiate arms control 
agreements nor advance new positions. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the talks were part of a continuing series of high-level contacts 
between U.S. and Soviet defense officials and military officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to improve understanding by the two sides in the military sphere," 
a senior Pentagon official who participated in the talks said afterward. "The 
hope is that the talks will enhance predictability and stability in the 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense, White House Officials 
</P>
<P>
The talks were attended by Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood, 
Undersecretary of Defense Paul G. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of Defense 
Steven Hadley and the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. 
Powell. Other defense, White House and State Department officials sat in. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet official was accompanied by more than a dozen civilian and military 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov has been defense minister since May, 1987, when he took over in a 
shake-up brought on by the penetration of Soviet air defenses by West German 
teen-ager Mathias Rust, who flew a single-engine Cessna into the heart of Red 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet official was met at the Pentagon on Monday morning by Cheney and a 
military honor guard. The two defense chiefs then met privately for 15 minutes 
in Cheney's office before a 90-minute session with their staffs. The talks 
continued two hours after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon official described the discussions as "businesslike, informed, very 
candid." He would provide no further details. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov is to visit the Gettysburg (Pa.) Civil War battlefield this morning and 
to meet with President Bush at the White House this afternoon. He will deliver 
speeches in Washington and New York, then visit military bases in California, 
Arizona and North Carolina before returning to Moscow on Friday.

<P>
Rain, floods and a tornado heaped more misery on Hugo-wrecked South Carolina on 
Monday, interrupting rebuilding efforts from the hurricane that pummeled the 
coast 12 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Relief officials deluged with clothing urged donors to send building supplies, 
food and cash. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for the people. It's terrible. It adds insult to injury," 
National Weather Service meteorologist Dick Shenot said after 2.5 inches of 
rain fell in a 24-hour period on Charleston, the town hardest hit by the 
hurricane's 135-m.p.h. winds. 
</P>
<P>
A tornado in Lebanon, about 25 miles north of Charleston, left two injured. 
About 100 people in Anderson County, 200 miles north, had to be evacuated 
because of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
The Broad and Blair rivers in Gaffney, the Congaree River in St. Matthews, the 
Waccamaw River in Conway and the Saluda River in Chappells spilled over their 
banks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiger River rose 12 feet above flood stage, damaging a major telephone 
cable and knocking out long-distance service from Spartanburg to Asheville, 
N.C., said Ron Laughlin, spokesman for AT&amp;T. He had no estimate of the 
number of people affected. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, also deluged by rain Monday and still recovering from Hugo, 
Monroe rescuers were looking for three people missing when a creek flooded and 
swept away their car. A fourth passenger was rescued after clinging to a downed 
tree for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Aid from across the nation continued to pour into South Carolina. The response 
has been so overwhelming, though, that some officials do not know what to do 
with everything. 
</P>
<P>
"We have clothing backed up on us, including in boxcars that have come from the 
West Coast," Maj. Ken Bush of the Salvation Army said. "People, generally 
speaking, only want a number of clothes . . . and we've reached that certain 
amount. We're backlogged." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 Rooms Full of Clothes 
</P>
<P>
In the fishing village of McClellanville, population 500, about 10 classrooms 
in the local school are filled "from floor to ceiling with used clothing." 
</P>
<P>
"Used clothing has almost choked us to death," said Billy Newsom of the 
American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Newsom said donations of non-perishable food items are still 
desperately needed. As cleanup efforts progress, hardware items will be in 
demand to help repair homes and businesses, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Quayle, Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, visited the hardest-hit areas 
of South Carolina and worked briefly at a relief center Monday in Moncks 
Corner. She was expected to work in Charleston before leaving the state today. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135-m.p.h. winds, 
leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless and 270,000 jobless.

COURT VOIDS TEXAS SCHOOL-FUNDING SYSTEM

The Texas Supreme Court found "glaring disparities" between the state's rich 
and poor school districts and ruled Monday that funding within the nation's 
second-largest system is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Spending varies by as much as $17,000 per pupil per year from rich to poor 
districts, the court found. 
</P>
<P>
"A remedy is long overdue," Justice Oscar Mauzy's opinion said. "The 
Legislature must take immediate action." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Implications 
</P>
<P>
The 9-0 ruling could have enormous financial and social implications for the 
3.3-million-student Texas school system, second in size to California's. 
</P>
<P>
The court found that the public school finance system violates the 113-year-old 
constitutional provision for an "efficient system" of public schools. It set a 
May 1, 1990, deadline for legislators to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
State attorneys had argued that the word "efficient" was intended to suggest a 
"simple and inexpensive system." 
</P>
<P>
But the court said: "The state's school financing system is neither financially 
efficient nor efficient in the sense of providing for a 'general diffusion of 
knowledge' statewide. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be recognized that the constitution requires an 'efficient,' not an 
'economical,' 'inexpensive' or 'cheap' system," Mauzy said. 
</P>
<P>
"A Band-Aid will not suffice; the system itself must be changed," the court 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Session Planned 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Bill Clements said that he will call a special 30-day session of the 
Legislature in the spring. Nearly $10 billion in state money will be made 
available for public schools in 1990-91, and almost $12 billion is expected to 
come from local districts. 
</P>
<P>
A state district judge in Austin had ruled that the school funding system was 
unconstitutional in a case brought by school districts with low property values 
against the state education commissioner and others. That ruling was overturned 
last December by a 2-1 vote of the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, known as Edgewood vs. Kirby, was filed in 1984. Public schools are 
funded largely through a combination of local property taxes and state aid. The 
federal government also contributes. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the disparities in district property wealth, annual spending per 
student ranges from $2,112 to $19,333, the high court said. 
</P>
<P>
The case got its title from the lead plaintiff, Edgewood Independent School 
District in San Antonio, and lead defendant, William Kirby, education 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Edgewood School Supt. James Vasquez led about 1,800 students and teachers in a 
celebration rally Monday. The high school's marching band played and students 
waved banners with sayings like "Victory" and "Edgewood All the Way." A marquee 
at the stadium's entrance read "Texas Children 9, Kirby 0." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Toughest' District 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we can begin to say we're no longer the poorest school district in 
Texas -- we're the toughest," Vasquez told cheering students and teachers. "We 
took on the state of Texas and we beat 'em." 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, Education Commissioner Kirby said, "As the lead defendant in this 
case, I have been required to defend the constitutionality of the system. But I 
have always maintained that it is not adequate and have pressed for additional 
amounts of money to improve equity." 
</P>
<P>
Olivia Besteiro, president of the Texas State Teachers Assn., said, "History 
will mark this day as the opening of the door to opportunity for tens of 
thousands, even millions, of children. These children have been the victims of 
'segregated' opportunity determined by a geographical roll of the dice."

Flanked by some of the city's Latino leaders, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on 
Monday all but promised a lawsuit if Congress and the President approve a 
measure that would lower the status of illegal aliens in the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, passed by the Senate on Friday, would exclude illegal aliens from 
the census count that will be used to reapportion the House of Representatives. 
Sponsored by Sen. Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.), the measure would hurt states 
such as California that expect to gain several more seats in Congress as a 
result of population gains based partly on the influx of illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby proposed the measure as an amendment to a governmental appropriations 
bill which is expected to go before a House-Senate conference committee this 
week or next. The House has rejected legislation similar to the Shelby 
amendment, but if the amendment is approved by the conference committee, its 
fate will be in the hands of President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Bradley argued that Shelby's proposed 
legislation is unconstitutional and that it would imperil millions of dollars 
in state and federal aid that the city receives based on the number of people, 
both legal and illegal, who reside in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he was certain a lawsuit would be filed challenging the measure if it 
becomes law, Bradley said he "would strongly urge that we be a partner in the 
lawsuit." The city is already a participant in a suit to compel the Census 
Bureau to adopt a new technique designed to correct the chronic undercounting 
of minorities, poor and homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that illegal aliens make up about 10% of the Los 
Angeles population. If they are not counted, the city could lose up to $180 
million a year in state aid and at least $40 million in federal aid the next 
decade, according to official estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"They (illegal aliens) use our hospitals, our streets and our housing, 
incurring for us certain obligations," Bradley said. "If we don't get to count 
them, we don't get our fair share of funds." 
</P>
<P>
The Shelby amendment would not prohibit the Census Bureau from counting illegal 
aliens, just exclude them from the reapportionment process. Nevertheless, city 
officials, as well as Latino activists, believe that the measure, because it 
would require illegals to be identified during the census, in effect would 
intimidate the Latino population and cause many people, both legal and illegal, 
to avoid being counted. The result, officials fear, would be a substantial 
undercount that would have financial implications for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher opposes the amendment, and has urged 
Bush to veto it if it is passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
However, the amendment is attached to an appropriations bill which includes 
much of the $7.9 billion Bush is seeking for the war on drugs. Opponents of the 
Shelby Amendment worry that the President would not want to tie up the 
anti-drug money.

LINK OF KIDNAPING SUSPECT TO OTHER INCIDENTS INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Southland police tried to determine Monday whether the suspected kidnaper of a 
homeless Orange County girl might have attempted to abduct at least 10 other 
Los Angeles-area children by luring them into his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives from four South Bay cities and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department said they are interested in learning more about Eduardo Uzcanga, a 
transient arrested Sunday afternoon by Santa Ana police a day after a 
6-year-old girl was kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things match and some things don't," said Manhattan Beach Police Sgt. 
Jack Zea. "We are going to look at him anyway. We are trying to get pictures of 
him and look at his background to see where he has been the last couple weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana youngster was abducted about 6:30 p.m. Saturday. Officials said 
her mother, who has three children, is homeless. Police found the child 
wandering in the same area about two hours later. Detectives are awaiting the 
results of a medical examination to determine if she was sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
Uzcanga, 48, on parole from an attempted murder conviction in Santa Ana, is 
being held in Orange County Jail. Officials with the Orange County district 
attorney's office say they expect to file a one-count kidnaping charge against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Police also confiscated Uzcanga's pickup truck, a dark blue Chevrolet with a 
white camper shell. The girl's mother told police she saw a man in a blue 
pickup truck grab her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana kidnapping is at least the 11th reported incident of its type in 
the Southland involving a dark-haired man with a mustache, who drove up to 
girls in a dark blue pickup. With the exception of the Santa Ana case, the 
children managed to get away and call for help, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The attempted kidnapings were reported in Hawthorne, Manhattan Beach, Pico 
Rivera, Redondo Beach and Torrance between Sept. 13 and last Thursday. Police 
said the man allegedly told the children that their parents were hurt and that 
he was supposed to pick them up, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there are some differences in descriptions of the suspect provided 
by witnesses and the children. Zea said Uzcanga is older than the man described 
by most witnesses. Also, Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach police say the 
suspect vehicle was described as a foreign-made compact truck, not a full-sized 
Chevrolet.

NUNN CHARGED WITH SIMPLE ASSAULT; 
</P>
<P>
BOXER ARRESTED AFTER ALTERCATION INVOLVING POLICE IN IOWA 
</P>

<P>
Michael Nunn, International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, was 
charged with simple assault, a misdemeanor, and was released after having been 
involved in an altercation Sunday involving seven police officers and an angry 
crowd in his hometown of Davenport, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, who lives in Agoura Hills, was charged when he grabbed the arm of officer 
Rollyn Meyers, who was attempting to arrest Nunn's mother, Madies Nunn, after 
she had hit another policeman, Martin Lopez, over the head with a shoe, opening 
a deep cut. 
</P>
<P>
The violence culminated a running feud involving three Davenport families, the 
Nunns, the Howards and the Baileys. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began in the early hours of Sunday morning, according to Capt. Jim 
Van Fossen of the Davenport Police Department, when Victoria Howard reported 
that Willie Nunn, a brother of the champion, and Raymond Jones, a nephew, had 
broken windows in her car. 
</P>
<P>
Two Bailey brothers then reported that Michael Nunn had pulled a gun on them 
and fired shots into the air. Police responded, but found no evidence of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
When police stopped Nunn Sunday afternoon on a Davenport street to search his 
car for a weapon, a crowd estimated at between 50 and 70 people gathered. Among 
them were members of the feuding families. When Nunn tried to go after one of 
them, he was restrained by police, according to Van Fossen. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Nunn's mother struck Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, Michael said, 'You're not arresting my mother,' and he grabbed 
the officer's arm," Van Fossen said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a news report, Nunn also threw a punch at the policeman, but Van 
Fossen said that wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was also arrested for threatening an officer with a hand ax and charged 
with assault while displaying a dangerous weapon. Madies Nunn was charged with 
assault with injury. 
</P>
<P>
In the confusion, someone in the crowd threw a punch at another policeman, Don 
Huss, opening a cut that required four stitches. 
</P>
<P>
As he was being led away, Nunn asked police to remove the handcuffs on his 
wrists, telling them, "I'm cool. I'm cool." 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty Nunn could receive would be 30 days in jail and a fine of 
$100.

TROUBLE IS, 91 WINS HAVE WAY OF CLOUDING PROBLEMS

Ninety-one Angel victories: Accomplishment . . . or anesthetic? 
</P>
<P>
Despite appearances to the contrary during their last 10 games, the Angels 
insist they haven't been lulled by a season that far exceeded spring 
expectations, a season that bettered their 1988 finish by 16 victories and 
resulted in the third-best record in the franchise's history. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make some changes," owner Gene Autry says. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice President Mike Port says: "I don't think any of us is 
satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's this from Manager Doug Rader: "If we were good enough, we 
wouldn't go through the (slumps) we did this year. I really do think we rose 
above most occasions and got through some difficult times, but we've been very 
streaky both ways. 
</P>
<P>
"When a team is streaky, that shows inconsistency. And that kind of 
inconsistency suggests that you may not be as good as you'd like to be." 
</P>
<P>
What the Angels' 1989 season should be remembered for -- and, really, nothing 
more -- is a restoration of the team's self-respect. That, in itself, was a 
substantial undertaking, considering the malaise that took hold during 
consecutive 75-87 seasons, Cookie Ball and the ignominious 12-game 
season-closing losing streak of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But at 91-71, the Angels still placed third in the American League West, still 
finished eight games behind the Oakland Athletics and still require more than a 
few alterations if they are to resist backsliding in baseball's best division 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The rotation, which produced three 15-game winners and rookie-of-the-year 
candidate Jim Abbott, needs another pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen, which featured Bryan Harvey with 25 saves, Greg Minton with a 2.20 
earned-run average and Bob McClure at 1.55, needs at least one more proven 
hand, preferably a short-relief specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The offense, which led the American League with 145 home runs, needs to add a 
30-home run, 100-runs batted in threat and, at long last, locate a legitimate, 
and willing, leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot stand pat," Port says. "Candidly, 90 wins -- despite some good 
individual performances -- wasn't what we were collectively shooting for. 
Finishing where we did, we still have some ground to cover. 
</P>
<P>
". . . We have to look for ways to improve our run production and I wouldn't 
say we would shy away from any additional pitching." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the Angels' success in 1989 was a mirage. The Eastern Division 
was badly depressed and the Angels got fat against that division, going 50-34 
without having to play either Toronto or Baltimore after July 18. Oakland was 
riddled by injuries. And the heart of the Angel revival -- starting pitching -- 
hinged on four of the club's five starters playing out best-case scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bert Blyleven goes 17-5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chuck Finley wins 16 games and makes the All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kirk McCaskill avoids injury all year and wins 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Abbott makes the big club, stays there all summer and, poised and 
professional, chips in with 12 victories. 
</P>
<P>
Back in March, who could have predicted any of it? 
</P>
<P>
And who knows if any of them can do it again? 
</P>
<P>
Only Mike Witt and his 9-15 record fell below expectations. But this was hardly 
a stunning development, considering how Witt's record and ERA have 
progressively worsened since 1986. In the last four years, Witt has gone from 
18 wins to 16 to 13 to nine. Over the same span, his ERA has swelled from 2.84 
to 4.01 to 4.15 to 4.54. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the Angels have a keen interest in Mark Langston, the soon-to-be 
$10-million free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, the Angels are in a quandary. They finished first in the league in 
home runs and featured three regulars batting better than .280, but they also 
led the league in strikeouts, were 12th in runs scored, 12th in RBIs and last 
in walks. 
</P>
<P>
It is a strange batting order. With the possible exception of first baseman 
Wally Joyner, every member of the regular lineup lacks one important dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Johnny Ray. He led the team with a .289 batting average and drove in 62 
runs. But he can't run and is barely adequate in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jack Howell. He hit 20 home runs, second most on the team. But he batted 
just .228 with a looping swing that produced 125 strikeouts and can send him 
into a black hole for weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dick Schofield. He remains one of the slickest fielding shortstops in the 
majors. But he still doesn't hit -- .228 with 26 RBIs -- and now his durability 
has become a question. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lance Parrish. He added 17 home runs and received credit for calling a more 
aggressive game behind the plate. But he batted just .238, drove in just 50 
runs and struck out 104 times. And, as always, there's his back trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chili Davis. He was named the team's co-MVP, with Blyleven, after leading 
the club with 22 home runs and 90 RBIs. But he, too, struck out 108 times and 
remains a liability in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Devon White. He made the All-Star team and stole a career-high 44 bases. 
But he also led the club with 129 strikeouts, continues to balk at the leadoff 
assignment and plunged in the second half to a season-ending .245 average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Claudell Washington. His .273 average and 13 home runs were pluses. But his 
RBI total of 42 was that of a part-time outfielder and his numerous absences 
from the lineup became a burden down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Downing. His .283 batting average was his best in a decade. But a 
chronic rib cage injury hampers his power stroke, resulting in just 14 home 
runs -- his lowest full-season total since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Add in that only White and Washington reached double figures in stolen bases 
and you have a team that has trouble manufacturing runs when home runs are 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? 
</P>
<P>
With the free-agent field sorely lacking in power-hitting, run-producing types, 
the Angels might be better off bidding for Langston -- or a second-tier 
free-agent pitcher, such as Storm Davis -- and packaging their pitching surplus 
(i.e. Witt) and their second-base surplus (i.e. Ray) for one of several 
disgruntled sluggers who figure to be shopped this winter. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Joe Carter wants out of Ohio, Cincinnati's Eric Davis and the New 
York Mets' Darryl Strawberry both have eyes for Southern California and Kansas 
City's Danny Tartabull could be elsewhere by spring training. 
</P>
<P>
To acquire a hitter of such standing, the Angels would have to part with a lot, 
and Port ranks among the most cautious traders on the planet. He prefers safe 
and sound deals, parceling off a bunch of prospects for a veteran -- a la his 
acquisitions of Blyleven, Parrish and Ray. 
</P>
<P>
But to keep pace in the Western Division, where the Canseco-McGwire-Eckersley 
A's are making dynastic noises, the Angels have to make an impact move this 
off-season. Better yet, two of them. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Angels rediscovered how it felt to win again. They contended. They 
came close. Now they need to take the next leap. 
</P>
<P>
For Mike Port, the time to roll the dice is now.

ANGELS AND DODGERS / A LOOK BACK; 
</P>
<P>
CLAIRE DOESN'T WANT TO PAY FOR NEW LOOK WITH PITCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In searching for a printable summation of the 1989 Dodger season, look no 
further than noted philosopher Mike Morgan, who thought he was just answering a 
question about his winter plans. 
</P>
<P>
"First thing, my wife and I are going to Magic Mountain," the pitcher said. 
"We're going to ride the roller coaster." 
</P>
<P>
Pause. "The way things have gone for me, it's probably going to go off the 
tracks and do the tuna." 
</P>
<P>
The tuna? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that's what pitchers say a batter does when he's been hit and wants to 
make sure everybody knows he's hurt," Morgan said. "When the guy falls at home 
plate and rolls around, that's the tuna." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds about right. The 1989 Dodgers did the tuna. With only the entire sports 
world watching, the defending World Series champions fell, flopped and made 
fools of themselves for six months. 
</P>
<P>
And although they can never throw back this year's 77-83 record and replace it 
with last season's 94-67 mark, Dodger Vice President Fred Claire can certainly 
do some things this winter to avoid being stuck with this kind of season again. 
</P>
<P>
Claire, Manager Tom Lasorda and the rest of the organization's coaches and 
scouts will meet at a resort hotel in Mesa, Ariz., for three days beginning 
Thursday to determine what changes are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said Sunday that he wants to aggressively pursue what he perceives as a 
couple of missing pieces but that he will not raze the Dodgers' talented 
pitching base to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to get where we want by trading away Tim Belcher, John 
Wetteland, Ramon Martinez," Claire said. "We just won't do it." 
</P>
<P>
There are already moves in the works, as the Dodgers figure to reassign two of 
their coaches this week to meet an impending rule that will limit teams to five 
uniformed coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some ideas on what Claire should do, what he probably will do . . . 
and probably never thought of doing: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Add speed: No team in the National League stole fewer bases than the 
Dodgers, whose 81 thefts were only four more than Oakland's Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
No league team had fewer triples than the Dodgers, 17, a mere 50 shy of the Los 
Angeles club record of 67 set in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
They also left a league-high 1,171 runners on base, which only proves what 
pitcher Orel Hershiser said Sunday in his personal plea for speed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got guys who can't score from third on ground balls with the infield 
back," he said. "We've got guys who can't go from first to third on singles. 
And that adds up." 
</P>
<P>
Said an agreeing Claire: "That's obviously a missing thing. That's obviously 
something we are looking for. And the obvious spot is in center field, although 
we can't be limited to that." 
</P>
<P>
Among their center-field options, the Dodgers could seek speed in the person of 
Detroit outfielder Gary Pettis, a free agent who might serve as a reserve, or 
through trade for a couple of available Pennsylvania guys -- Philadelphia 
outfielder Len Dykstra and Pittsburgh outfielder Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Relax and read the history books: Five of the seven times in their Los 
Angeles history that the Dodgers have won fewer than 80 games, they have come 
back the next year and won more than 80 games. Included in those five rebound 
years are three first-place finishes and a second-place finish by the margin of 
a lost divisional playoff game to Houston in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be nice to Dave Hansen: On Aug. 20, this minor league third baseman was 
summoned from double-A San Antonio to join the team in Montreal. After flying 
all day, the left-handed hitter arrived at Olympic Stadium on Aug. 21, only to 
learn that since left-handed Mark Langston was pitching that night for the 
Expos, he would not play. The next morning, Mickey Hatcher was activated and 
Hansen was sent back to San Antonio. He has not been seen here since. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Add power: Not only did the Dodgers rank 11th of 12 league teams in homers, 
they couldn't even hit a decent fly ball, ranking last with 41 sacrifice flies. 
In a twist, their final run of the season scored on a sacrifice fly Sunday in 
Atlanta. But it was John Shelby's first this season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a big drop-off there, but much of it was due to injury to two of 
our biggest producers -- Kirk Gibson and Kal Daniels," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was probably an accidental slip, notice Claire didn't mention the 
often-injured Mike Marshall in that same breath. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not pleased with his season, and he's not pleased with his season," 
Claire said later of Marshall, whose bad back contributed to another 105-game 
season, which is actually the second-highest number of games Marshall has 
played in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
If the Dodgers find a center fielder, look for them to move Gibson to right and 
attempt to trade Marshall, a move that would benefit both. 
</P>
<P>
Claire could begin his search for power in Cleveland, where outfielder Joe 
Carter is available. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give John Wetteland his MTV: After going a month without a good start, 
rookie Wetteland prepared for his Sept. 20 date in San Francisco by locking 
himself in his 35th-floor hotel room, plugging in his guitar, and filling the 
hallway with the heavy metal song "Seek and Destroy." That night he held the 
West champion Giants to three hits in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, preparing for another start against the Giants, he hooked up 
his guitar in the Dodger clubhouse and played "Stairway to Heaven." That night 
he held the Giants to two runs in seven innings in a 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make Mickey Hatcher sleep at the ballpark: Hatcher was hurt twice this 
season. He pulled a hamstring chasing vandals down the street in front of his 
house, and he strained his groin muscle moving furniture in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
Claire confirmed Sunday that, as expected, the Dodgers hope to sign Hatcher for 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five other potential Dodger free agents, Fernando Valenzuela and Mike 
Morgan will be pursued by Claire, but John Shelby and Dave Anderson will 
probably be given opportunities to test the market. If they find no takers, 
they will probably be invited to spring training on a make-good basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have as many options at spring training as we can," Claire said. 
"And the flexibility of that type of contract is something that we would 
consider." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth, John Tudor, meanwhile, is as good as gone. Claire said the Dodgers 
offered him a chance to test his shoulder in the Instructional League, and he 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't believe first impressions: Dodger rookie Mike Munoz's first major 
league pitch was hit for a home run, and shortstop Jose Vizcaino threw his 
first major league ground ball into the opponents' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy a date book and a red pen: First baseman Eddie Murray will begin next 
season having not missed a game since Aug. 23, 1987 -- a streak of 359 games, 
the third-longest in major league baseball. Murray has also not committed an 
error since May 30, a stretch of 104 games. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Orel Hershiser will begin the season having not missed a start in his 
career -- a string of 191 games dating to May 26, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Kirk Gibson will begin the season having not played a game since 
July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be thankful you didn't win a World Series title this year: Jeff Hamilton 
offered this insight into the Dodgers' problems when asked about the coming 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I really am looking forward to it, because this year, there finally will be a 
winter," he said. "Last year, with our season being extended so long, and 
everything happening, I never really got to sit down and relax. It was like I 
looked up and said, 'Oh man, it's already January, I've got to start working 
again.' It was a real mental thing. I really had to push myself to get going." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton should be around for a third full big league season with the Dodgers. 
He may have saved his job with a final-month tear that pushed his average from 
a low of .229 on Aug. 21 to high of .250 on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff doesn't realize how good he can be," Claire said in a vote of confidence. 
"When he realizes that he belongs here, you'll start seeing really big 
seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Find a left-handed reliever you can trust: The three lefty relievers used 
by the Dodgers this year included one minor leaguer and a guy who was released 
at midseason. They were given a lead just 11 times in 66 appearances. The 
Dodgers' record in games they pitched was 16-51. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ricky Horton is back pitching with St. Louis, both rookie Munoz and 
veteran Ray Searage are going to winter ball to work on their skills. They 
should expect a fight for jobs when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hope Orel Hershiser doesn't ask for overtime: If anybody could complain 
about the Dodgers' two 22-inning games this year, it is pitcher Hershiser. He 
worked seven innings in each, even though he started only one of them. 
</P>
<P>
He faced Houston in relief at 1 a.m. June 4 in a game that began June 3, and 
then faced Montreal for the first seven innings on Aug. 23, only to wait in the 
clubhouse for four hours before the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
How did he do? How do you think? In 14 total innings he allowed no runs on 
seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Dodgers played fewer games, 160, than any other National League 
team, they played more innings, 1,463 1/3, than all but Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remember those sweet Atlanta Braves: For the season's final game in 
Atlanta, on Fan Appreciation Day, Dodger Publicity Director Mike Williams 
bought a ticket in hopes of winning a prize. He did. He won a dozen lovely 
long-stemmed roses. He wouldn't say whether a sympathy card was attached.

<TEXT>
<P>
FIRST BASE 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire, Athletics: Hit 33 homers with 95 runs batted in. Batted only .205 
against Toronto this year, but hit three homers with 10 RBIs in 39 at-bats. 
Bats .184 on artificial turf. Hit .333 in 1988 playoffs, was one for 17 in 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff, Blue Jays: Led league with 36 home runs after hitting 34 last 
year in first full season. Did not hit a home run after Sept. 4, a span of 24 
games. Drew 119 walks. Batted .217 against Oakland with three homers and eight 
RBIs in 46 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff is a better fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Edge to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SECOND BASE 
</P>
<P>
Tony Phillips, Athletics: Batted .262 with 47 RBIs. Was just three for 11 in 
steal attempts. Hit .182 with 10 strikeouts in 33 at-bats against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Liriano or Manny Lee, Blue Jays: Both are switch-hitters, but Liriano is 
likely to start more often because he hits better left-handed and is smoother 
on double plays. Liriano drew eight walks in 54 plate appearances against 
Oakland. Lee hit 100 points higher on grass than turf. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the weakest spot for both teams. No edge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THIRD BASE 
</P>
<P>
Carney Lansford, Athletics: Batted .336, second in the league. Hit .392 against 
left-handers and was 50 points higher on the road than at home. Safe on 37 of 
52 steal tries. Had .440 on-base percentage against Toronto. Batted .294 in 
each of two previous playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Gruber, Blue Jays: Hit career-high 18 home runs. Made 22 errors, nine 
more than Lansford. Batted .316 with four homers and 10 RBIs in 38 at-bats 
against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford is a proven, steady player. Gruber might produce big things, but he 
might not. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford gets a slight edge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHORTSTOP 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gallego or Walt Weiss, Athletics: Gallego took over when Walt Weiss was 
injured and did well enough to keep the job. He hit .323 with five RBIs against 
Toronto. Weiss, rookie of the year in 1988, was 0 for 11 against Toronto this 
season. If Weiss starts, Gallego will probably start at second base. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Fernandez, Blue Jays: Made just six errors, one better than league record 
for shortstops set by Detroit's Eddie Brinkman in 1972. Hit career-high 11 home 
runs and batted nearly .300 after he was moved down to the sixth spot on Aug. 
12. Batted .310 against Oakland. Hit .333 in the 1985 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Big edge to the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CATCHER 
</P>
<P>
Terry Steinbach or Ron Hassey, Athletics: Steinbach plays against left-handers, 
Hassey goes against righties. Steinbach slumped after an All-Star first half. 
Batted .364 against Toronto. Hassey went four for eight in last year's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Whitt or Pat Borders, Blue Jays: Whitt, the last remaining original Blue 
Jay, starts against right-handers and Borders plays against lefties. Whitt 
ended the season in a nine-for-57 slump. Borders hit .290 at night, 100 points 
higher than during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's platoon has more potential and has the edge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEFT FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson, Athletics: Led majors with 77 stolen bases (was caught 14 
times). Batted .274 and led league with 126 walks. A right-handed hitter, yet 
batted 40 points higher against righties. Has improved in the outfield and gave 
Oakland the leadoff hitter it needed in trade from New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell, Blue Jays: Got 104 RBIs, his third time in four seasons with at 
least 100. Started at designated hitter 19 times, including the last eight 
because of an inflamed right elbow, without any arguments. Was suspended twice 
for disputes with umpires. Hit .321 in the 1985 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Two completely different players, each the key to their team's offense. 
</P>
<P>
No edge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTER FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Dave Henderson, Athletics: In the postseason, he's career .329 hitter with four 
home runs. Loves big games. Hit 60 points higher at home, .250 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Moseby, Blue Jays: Hit .440 during first week of September, but is in 
11-for-58 slump. Has batted leadoff for most of the last month. Hit .221 
overall and just .180 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Edge to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIGHT FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco, Athletics: Hit 17 home runs after not playing until after the 
All-Star break because of a wrist injury. Homered twice in 14 at-bats against 
Toronto. Batted .170 on turf. Hit .313 with three home runs in four games in 
last year's playoffs and hit a grand slam in his first at-bat in the World 
Series, but finished in an 0-for-18 rut. 
</P>
<P>
Mookie Wilson, Blue Jays: Canada's newest hero. Acquired from New York Mets on 
Aug. 1 and credited with sparking Blue Jays to championship. Batted .298 and 
has stolen 12 consecutive bases. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's hustle gets Toronto going, but if Canseco swings a big bat, Oakland 
will win. 
</P>
<P>
Edge to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PITCHING 
</P>
<P>
STARTERS: Dave Stewart, Mike Moore, Bob Welch and Storm Davis, Athletics: 
Stewart (21-9) is first pitcher to win 20 games in three consecutive seasons 
since Jim Palmer in 1975-77. Had 2.77 earned-run average at home, 3.91 on road. 
Is 8-5 lifetime against Toronto. Moore (19-11) held opponents to a .219 batting 
average, but is 4-12 career vs. Toronto. Davis (19-7) went 2-0 against Blue 
Jays this season and pitched 12 1/3 scoreless innings in 1988 playoffs. Welch 
(17-8) became famous for striking out Reggie Jackson in the World Series, but 
has allowed 19 earned runs in 22 postseason innings. 
</P>
<P>
STARTERS: Dave Stieb, Todd Stottlemyre, Jimmy Key and Mike Flanagan, Blue Jays: 
Stieb (17-8) is the only one with a winning record. Opponents hit .219 against 
him. Lost Game 7 of the 1985 playoffs. Stottlemyre (7-7) is better at home, but 
will start Game 2 in Oakland. Key (13-15) gave up four home runs in 17 2/3 
innings to Oakland this season and was 0-2. Flanagan (8-10) will go 12 days 
without pitching, but is 18-7 lifetime against the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers all favor the Athletics, but are they big-game pitchers? Maybe, 
although Oakland's edge is not as big as the statistics might seem to show. 
</P>
<P>
BULLPEN: Dennis Eckersley, Gene Nelson, Rick Honeycutt and Todd Burns, 
Athletics: Eckersley saved 33 games and right-handers hit just .121 against 
him. Nelson allowed one run in 10 innings in last year's postseason. Honeycutt 
held lefties to a .156 average. 
</P>
<P>
BULLPEN: Tom Henke, Jim Acker, Dave Wells, Duane Ward and John Cerutti, Blue 
Jays: Henke struck out 116 batters in 89 innings with 20 saves. Had an 0.93 ERA 
after Toronto's 12-24 start. Acker had 1.59 ERA after being traded by Atlanta 
in late August. Wells was 7-4 in middle relief. Cerutti was 11-11 in 31 starts, 
but is 0-6 lifetime against Oakland and more adaptable to a relief role. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams rely heavily on their bullpens. Each club has several middle 
relievers, a left-handed specialist and an excellent closer. 
</P>
<P>
Slight edge to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DESIGNATED HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker, Athletics: Hit 22 home runs with 97 RBIs. Grounded into 21 double 
plays, tied with Lansford and two behind McGwire. Got the only three hits off 
Orel Hershiser in Game 2 of the World Series last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Mazzilli, Blue Jays: Joined Toronto a day after Wilson arrived from Mets. 
Batted .227 but is good at drawing walks. 
</P>
<P>
Sizable edge to Oakland, particularly because adjusting to the DH role on short 
notice can be tricky for former National Leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BENCH 
</P>
<P>
Ken Phelps, Stan Javier, Athletics: Phelps was 11 for 38 with three homers and 
13 RBIs as a pinch-hitter. Oakland got him in late August from the Yankees. 
Javier was four for eight in last year's postseason. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Felix, Tom Lawless, Rance Mulliniks, Blue Jays: Felix helped Toronto 
early in the season, but the rookie slumped when the league got a better look 
at him. Still, he hit nine homers with 46 RBIs. Lawless is 12 for 13 in steal 
attempts. Mulliniks was three for 18 as a pinch-hitter this year. 
</P>
<P>
Even. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MANAGERS 
</P>
<P>
Tony La Russa, Athletics: Prepares himself and his team for each game as well 
as anyone in baseball. One of five managers in major league history to hold a 
law degree. 
</P>
<P>
Cito Gaston, Blue Jays: Took over when Toronto was 12-24; Blue Jays went 77-49 
after that, best in the majors in that time. Is not flashy, but is liked and 
respected by his players. 
</P>
<P>
Neither manager relies on Tom Lasorda-like emotion. Experience will help La 
Russa, so he gets the edge.

NOLAN RYAN PUTS OFF RETIREMENT; 
</P>
<P>
RANGER PITCHER WILL TRY TO GET 300TH VICTORY NEXT YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
Nolan Ryan, the oldest pitcher to have 300 strikeouts in a season, said Monday 
he will go for his 300th victory next year and "be disappointed" if he doesn't 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
At 42, the Texas Rangers' right-hander is 11 victories short of 300, considered 
an automatic ticket to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Although he considered retiring, Ryan had to be encouraged by his performance 
this season. He finished with a major league leading 301 strikeouts, 66 more 
than runner-up Mark Langston of the Montreal Expos, and he had 16 victories, 
his highest total since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I should get 300 if I stay healthy and pitch all season," said Ryan, whose 
pitch was clocked at 99 m.p.h. in one game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's biggest milestone came Aug. 22 when he got his 5,000th strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
"My return hinged on how I fared physically and how my family enjoyed it," Ryan 
said. "Going in, I had programmed that it was my last year. I thought along 
those lines until the last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be, if not the most enjoyable season, one that would rate up 
there with the top couple of seasons. The Rangers treated my family great. They 
are kid-oriented. In my last several seasons in Houston, my kids wouldn't even 
go to the Astrodome." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's two boys traveled on trips with the Rangers. He also has a daughter. His 
wife, Ruth, went on some trips and Ryan said, "If it had been up to her, she 
would have been on the field hitting and shagging balls, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rangers worked with my kids and that meant a lot to me. That wasn't the 
attitude in Houston." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who will make $1.4 million on his 1990 contract, has been offered an 
option for the 1991 season, but he said, "I haven't even thought that far 
ahead."

NEWSWIRE: POLONIA SENTENCED TO 60 DAYS IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luis Polonia, New York Yankee outfielder, was sentenced to 60 days in jail and 
fined $1,500 Monday on the misdemeanor charge of having sex with a 15-year-old 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Doherty, Milwaukee County circuit judge, also ordered Polonia to make a 
$10,000 contribution to the Sinai Samaritan Medical Center's sexual assault 
treatment center in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia, who pleaded no contest in August to the charge of having sexual 
intercourse with a child, will report Wednesday to begin his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia probably will have work release privileges. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a mistake and I'm really sorry for it," Polonia told the judge before 
the sentence was imposed. "I'm a human being and anybody can make the mistake I 
made." 
</P>
<P>
Doherty said that although Polonia's relationship with the girl was consensual, 
the purpose of the law is to protect the naive "from predators, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to impose some jail sentence would diminish the significance of this 
incident," Doherty said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he hoped the sentence would send a message to young men like 
Polonia who travel around the country "to think twice, three or four times and 
then not do it." 
</P>
<P>
Polonia, who was traded from Oakland to New York during the season, could have 
received a maximum penalty of nine months in jail and $10,000 in fines.

The Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field in the United 
States, began its program of out-of-competition drug testing, aimed at curbing 
the use of anabolic steroids and other banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen athletes have been selected for testing this week. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the top 15 performers in each event are subject to random 
selection for testing for the use of steroids, masking agents and diuretics 
within 48 hours of notification. 
</P>
<P>
TAC, which has budgeted $300,000 for the program and will receive an additional 
$100,000 from the United States Olympic Committee, plans to test 60 athletes a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the process the names of those tested will remain confidential. 
Names will be revealed only after test results are conclusive and, in the event 
of a positive test, all appeals are exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
A positive test could result in a two-year suspension from competition, whereas 
an athlete who tests positive a second time faces a lifetime ban from the 
sport.

Davey Johnson says he is convinced he is out as manager of the New York Mets, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not bringing me back," Johnson is quoted as saying in Tuesday's 
editions of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't told me that, but they should have. They're probably waiting so 
they can confirm my replacement. And there is somebody available in the 
organization: Bud Harrelson, who's popular in New York." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Joe McIlvaine, the Mets' vice president for baseball 
operations, denied that a decision had been made and that one is not expected 
to be reached until the end of the week or later.

CHIROPRACTORS GET NEW RESPECT FROM HOSPITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michigan chiropractor James Gregg recalled his shock and wonder when a 
cardiologist on the staff of New Center Hospital in Detroit strode up recently 
and thrust four medical charts into his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"These patients are complaining of chest pains and I can't find anything," he 
said gravely, according to Gregg. "You want to take a look?" 
</P>
<P>
When Gregg recovered from his surprise at being consulted by a heart 
specialist, he hurried to check out the patients. All were suffering from 
spinal problems, not angina, and were discharged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For years chiropractors have been considered medical untouchables. They 
couldn't get into the hospital even as patients, the joke went at a large 
Chicago medical facility. 
</P>
<P>
But today, spinal manipulators are beginning to invade the sacred domain of the 
physician. The American Hospital Assn. estimates that between 50 and 100 
hospitals nationwide have granted chiropractors the right to treat patients in 
their wards, most of these in the past two years. Hundreds of others now allow 
chiropractors to use diagnostic equipment such as X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Our Time Is Coming' 
</P>
<P>
"We don't consider ourselves to be 'only chiropractors' any more," said Louis 
Sportelli, a Palmerton, Pa., practitioner who is chairman of the board of the 
American Chiropractic Assn. "We're starting to see the sun. Our time is 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
Many medical doctors, however, continue to regard chiropractors with skepticism 
and worry that their growing assertiveness will lead them into medical areas 
for which they have no training. 
</P>
<P>
Of modern chiropractors, Dr. Charles McElwee, president of the Los Angeles 
County Medical Assn., said: "I think they're better, better trained and they 
get in less trouble" than their forebears. But he said too many still try to 
treat conditions they are not trained to do. "I've seen people manipulated who 
had broken necks. God was with them that they didn't get paralyzed." 
</P>
<P>
Whether they ever can get the respect they feel they deserve from mainstream 
medicine, chiropractors already have gained a higher profile through 
increasingly aggressive lobbying and advertising campaigns, some featuring such 
famous chiropractic patients as San Francisco 49er quarterback Joe Montana. 
Last year, for the first time, a chiropractor was taken abroad by the U. S. 
Olympic team to treat athletes. 
</P>
<P>
They also are attempting to step into new areas of treatment, including a 
controversial proposal for the Los Angeles Board of Education to allow 
chiropractors to perform physical examinations for school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everything Has Changed' 
</P>
<P>
"Chiropractors are moving into a lot of what was traditionally considered 
medical territory, whether we like it or not," said Dr. Ron Lawrence, a Los 
Angeles physician who served on the state Board of Chiropractic Examiners. 
"Everything has changed. It's a new ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
While trend-setting Hollywood celebrities such as Jack Nicholson have been 
seeing chiropractors for a decade, two more recent events in the medical world 
have brought them new attention and status. First, U.S. District Judge Susan 
Getzendanner ruled in Chicago in 1987 that the AMA had mounted a 24-year 
campaign to destroy the practice of chiropractic. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing thousands of documents, including a 1971 American Medical Assn. 
memo pledging to "stop or eliminate the licensure of chiropractic," 
Getzendanner handed down an injunction ordering the AMA not to interfere with a 
physician's right to consult, refer patients to and work hand in hand with 
chiropractors. Her ruling is on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
A second factor that has led hospitals to open their doors to chiropractors is 
hard economics. Since the federal government imposed new limits on Medicare 
payments in 1983, hospitals have been forced to watch the bottom line more 
closely; wards have emptied; some facilities have closed. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Moore, administrator at New Center Hospital, said that to survive, his 
hospital began "diversifying the use of our beds." Sixty chiropractors are now 
on staff and Moore estimated that they have boosted the hospital's income by 
10% annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Leveler' 
</P>
<P>
Said Sportelli: "Economics is the great leveler and has a way of eliminating 
prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
The 72-bed Canoga Park Hospital recently became the first in California to 
allow chiropractors to treat patients in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
At Canoga Park, Simi Valley practitioner Charles Neault bent over a bed 
recently and pushed on the legs of Gerald Addis, 36, and suffering from a 
herniated disc. Nurses trained to respect physicians openly gawked at the sight 
of a chiropractor in the hospital and laying hands on a patient. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that hurt?" asked Neault, as he bent to his work. The patient grimaced, 
but said he preferred the pain to surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Addis is not alone. There are 55,000 chiropractors in the United States and the 
chiropractic association says its surveys show that one in seven people visited 
a chiropractor in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Many patients seem satisfied with their care. A 1983 Gallup poll showed that 
70% of those who had consulted a chiropractor would do so again. 
</P>
<P>
Practitioners are trained in the workings of the musculo-skeletal system. They 
believe adjustments of the spine can alleviate chronic pain and even prevent 
the need for surgery in some cases. There are 17 colleges of chiropractic in 
the United States and today's practitioners are better trained than ever 
before, spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
The attitude of medical doctors toward chiropractors moving into new treatment 
areas varies, but seems more accepting than when Dr. Joseph Sabatier Jr., the 
AMA's chairman of the Committee on Quackery, who compared them in 1973 to rabid 
house pets -- "cute but killers." 
</P>
<P>
The May issue of the American Journal of Public Health published a Washington 
state study that says only 3% of family doctors believe chiropractors are 
quacks. 
</P>
<P>
A number of chiropractors said they are receiving more referrals -- and more 
invitations to lunch -- from physicians than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's a quantum change, as much as an evolution in attitudes" 
toward chiropractors, said Dr. David Chernoff, president-elect of the Los 
Angeles County Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Said McElwee, president of the medical association: "Has the attitude changed? 
Yes. It had to change, it's been mandated by law. Whether underlying feelings 
have changed a lot, I'm not certain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Hippocrates 
</P>
<P>
Even in discussing history, physicians and chiropractors hold divergent views. 
When chiropractors discuss their antecedents, they invariably bring up 
Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physician. But hostile medical doctors point to 
an American grocer and "magnetic healer" named D. D. Palmer, who a century ago 
proposed spinal manipulation as a cure for a wide variety of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, some chiropractors profess to be able to cure diabetes and other 
non-musculo-skeletal ailments, sometimes with calamitous results. "I have seen 
things that made me shudder," admitted one chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
But reputable chiropractors insist these "bad apples" are dying off. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, though, the AMA has denounced the practice as "quackery and 
cultism," and in 1967 declared it unethical for physicians to professionally 
associate with chiropractors. George McAndrews, the Chicago attorney who 
represented four chiropractors in their landmark lawsuit, said the AMA's 
anti-chiropractic campaign so intimidated its members that a doctor once wrote 
an anguished letter to the medical association. A chiropractor had joined the 
local Rotary Club, he said. Must he resign? The AMA, McAndrews said, advised 
him to remain but warned him to be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Chiropractors say the AMA campaign against them helped shape a public image of 
the chiropractor as a bumbling cultist, while promoting physicians as 
all-caring, all-knowing. "There are no Dr. Kildare chiropractors on 
television," said Sportelli. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antitrust Ruling 
</P>
<P>
But then on Aug. 27, 1987, Getzendanner ruled that the AMA's anti-chiropractic 
campaign violated antitrust law. "Keeping chiropractors out of hospitals was 
one of the goals of the boycott," she said. The AMA has appealed her ruling and 
now officially refuses to comment on chiropractors or "any other alternative 
form of medicine." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of that ruling, however, hospital doors have begun to swing open to 
chiropractors. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to know just how many hospitals have welcomed them, because 
the American Hospital Assn. does not keep records. The American Chiropractic 
Assn. lists 18 facilities that have gone so far as to put them on staff. 
Leading chiropractors and the AHA agree that the number allowing practitioners 
to work in the hospital, on staff or off, could be as high as 100. 
</P>
<P>
And the pace of change is accelerating. "There is more and more and more of 
it," Donna Wilson, AHA director of medical affairs, said of hospitals allowing 
chiropractors on their wards. "This is the right time for chiropractors to get 
their foot in." 
</P>
<P>
Chiropractors have made headway in other areas, too, using lobbying techniques 
and a growing talent for self-promotion. Walter Zelman, executive director of 
California Common Cause, said that in Sacramento, chiropractors have been "a 
very active lobbying group, giving away large amounts of campaign contributions 
for a modest-sized organization." 
</P>
<P>
But barriers still remain between chiropractors and physicians. After the Board 
of Chiropractic Examiners in California authorized pre- and post-natal 
chiropractic care in 1987, the California Medical Assn. filed suit. Sacramento 
County Superior Court Judge Steven Rodda ruled on Dec. 28 that such care was 
beyond their "scope of practice." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, some chiropractors are still nursing old wounds, even in the 
flush of victory. Corwin said hospitals have been taking him to nice 
restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area, trying to persuade him to use his 
influence to bring his colleagues in to their facilities. So far, he has 
rejected their advances: "I said, '10 years ago you wouldn't let me in to take 
an X-ray. Now you're begging me.' "

'REAR WINDOW' GOES TO SUPREME COURT; 
</P>
<P>
AT STAKE IS HOW OWNERSHIP OF ORIGINAL COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL AFFECTS REVENUE FROM 
FILMS 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court, agreeing to hear an appeal from actor Jimmy Stewart, 
announced Monday it would settle a major copyright dispute that may threaten 
hundreds of classic motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and the daughter of the late director Alfred Hitchcock are asking the 
justices to overturn an appellate court ruling that said they must share the 
profits from the re-release of the 1954 movie "Rear Window" with a New York 
literary researcher who owns the copyright for the story that the film was 
based on. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, stunned 
movie industry lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision turns the practices of the studios upside down," said Stephen 
Kroft, a Beverly Hills lawyer who, on behalf of the major Hollywood studios, 
urged the high court to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Unless this ruling is reversed, Kroft told the court, "hundreds, if not 
thousands" of movies may face copyright infringement suits from the owners of 
old copyrights of stories, songs, paintings or literary characters, which were 
incorporated into the films. 
</P>
<P>
This problem is not likely to arise for recent movies, which, under the 
Copyright Act of 1976, have one copyright period extending for 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
The film industry had also thought the issue was settled for older movies. The 
U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in 1977 that a movie or 
play was a "derivative work" with a copyright of its own incorporating all the 
works that went into it. Under the Copyright Act of 1909, material could be 
copyrighted for 28 years and renewed for another 28. Under the New York rule, 
once artists, authors or composers sell their work to movie makers, neither 
they nor their heirs can benefit further from the completed movie. 
</P>
<P>
But in December, the appeals court in California took a sharply different view. 
In an opinion by Judge Harry Pregerson of Los Angeles, the court said the 
author of a work incorporated into a movie held a separate and distinct 
copyright. After the initial copyright period expired in 28 years, the 
copyright reverted to the author or the author's heirs, Pregerson said. With 
the advent of home video recorders, classic movies can remain money-making 
properties long after the initial 28-year copyright has expired, creating an 
obvious potential for conflict between the rules set by New York and California 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court typically intervenes when the regional federal appeals courts 
are in conflict on the meaning of a federal law. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for "Rear Window" dated back to 1942 when author Cornell Woolrich 
published a story in Dime Detective magazine called "It Had to Be Murder." 
Three years later, Woolrich sold the rights to the story to a film production 
company for $9,250. In 1954, Stewart and Hitchcock formed their own company, 
bought the rights to the Woolrich story and made it into the movie, starring 
Stewart and Grace Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
That might have been the end of the matter, except for one other development. 
In 1968, just before Woolrich was scheduled to sign over the copyright for 
another 28 years, he died leaving no heirs. His estate, intended for the 
benefit of Columbia University, later sold his copyright to Sheldon Abend, a 
self-described "literary researcher," for $650. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Stewart and Hitchcock's heirs authorized the re-release of 
"Rear Window" for theaters, television and video sales. It earned an additional 
$12 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Abend then filed a copyright infringement suit in federal court in Los Angeles, 
seeking a share of the $12 million. A trial judge, citing the New York rule, 
dismissed the suit. However, on a 2-1 vote, the 9th Circuit Court said Abend's 
copyright had been infringed and returned the case to a trial court to 
calculate the damages. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Louis Petrich, who appealed to the high court on Stewart's 
behalf, said he was not surprised the justices agreed to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a problem that won't go away, and there's a clear conflict between 2nd 
Circuit and the 9th Circuit," Petrich said, referring to the two federal 
appeals courts that govern most of the nation's copyright actions. 
</P>
<P>
James P. Tierney, a Santa Monica attorney representing Abend, said the 9th 
Circuit Court ruling was correct and should be upheld. "It was just a 
restatement of existing law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tierney, Abend has purchased at least 100 other old copyrights, 
but he also believes the studios have exaggerated the extent of the problem 
they face. 
</P>
<P>
"All they need to do is sit down with the heirs or whoever holds the copyright 
and say, 'Let's make a deal,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The high court will likely hear arguments in the case early next year, with a 
ruling due by July 1.

PANEL SEEKS TO BAR FUNDING FOR 'OBSCENE' ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The fragile compromise to resolve the censorship controversy enveloping the 
National Endowment for the Arts inched closer to resolution Monday with release 
of the final draft of a House-Senate conference committee report detailing 
restrictions on artwork the endowment may support. 
</P>
<P>
But the final product of the conference committee deliberations included 
significantly less restrictive language than conservatives first proposed. The 
report includes a provision that no national endowment money "may be used to 
promote, disseminate or produce materials, which in the judgement of the NEA 
and the National Endowment for the Humanities, may be considered obscene." 
</P>
<P>
Picking up language first introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the report 
also stipulates that artwork in any media may be denied support if they include 
"depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of 
children or individuals engaged in sex acts which, when taken as a whole, do 
not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value." 
</P>
<P>
However, legal experts and even the head of the House delegation to the 
conference committee, Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.), said doubts may remain over 
the constitutionality of some provisions of the compromise, which bar national 
endowment support of "obscene" artwork in any medium. 
</P>
<P>
And separate objections were raised Monday by arts-law experts and a 
homosexual-rights group over the possibility that the compromise agreement 
language -- which places special emphasis on prohibiting homoerotic artwork -- 
may make the endowment's funding-review panels reluctant to approve grants for 
artwork dealing with gay subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Yates said he may attempt to bring the compromise 
agreement up for a final vote in the House as early as this afternoon. 
Unanimous consent of all members of the House would be required for the move 
and Yates said he was uncertain whether conservative opponents of federal arts 
funding would agree. 
</P>
<P>
If the conservative congressmen block Yates's attempt to bring the matter to a 
vote today, Yates said, final action in the House would probably not come until 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The final wording of the compromise report reflected results of the fractious 
debate within the conference committee and, separately, on the floor of the 
Senate late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Helms attempted unsuccessfully to push through the Senate a non-binding 
resolution restating support for and amendment to an NEA funding bill Helms 
first offered in July that would have outlawed virtually all "indecent," 
"offensive" and "obscene" artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said some question remains whether the provisions of the funding bill 
would pass a strict constitutional test. He noted that the conference committee 
language is patterned in part after wording developed by the U.S. Supreme Court 
in a landmark 1972 pornography case, Miller vs. California. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that it would be constitutional," Yates said, "but I don't know 
the answer to that, really, in view of the fact that the Supreme Court has not 
been precise in its definitions of obscenity." 
</P>
<P>
John E. Frohnmayer, the Portland, Ore., attorney who was confirmed by the 
Senate on Friday as the endowment's new chairman, said in a telephone interview 
that, while he had not seen the final version of the conference committee 
report, the new language "should be easy enough to administer." 
</P>
<P>
But Frohnmayer expressed some indirect concern about how the arts endowment 
could devise workable standards to weed out "obscene" works that lack any 
artistic merit because "my concern is that obscenity has never been an easy 
item to define or adjudicate, except on a case by case basis." 
</P>
<P>
James Fitzpatrick, a prominent arts lawyer with the Washington firm of Arnold 
&amp; Porter, contended that the wording in the conference committee report is 
"strangely drafted," since it includes only two of three major elements of the 
Supreme Court's obscenity formula in the Miller case. 
</P>
<P>
But Fitzpatrick contended that, since the conference committee report deleted a 
majority of what arts advocates perceived as the most worrisome language in the 
original Helms amendment, "one has to say that this is a major victory for 
those who are concerned about freedom of artistic expression in this country." 
</P>
<P>
However, Fitzpatrick and the legislative director for the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force said that the committee report's retention of Helms's 
original wording underscoring the objectionable nature of artwork with 
homoerotic and sadomasochistic themes could seriously inhibit arts projects in 
a variety of media that have any discernable gay emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my feeling that this (compromise language) was an attempt to gay-bash," 
said Peri Jude Radecic, of the task force. "I do feel this is an attempt to 
attack the gay and lesbian community," she said. "We are not happy with the 
final product. This is unacceptable, using the gay community as sort of the 
whipping post here." 
</P>
<P>
"By retaining the language references to sadomasochism, and particularly to 
homoeroticism," Fitzpatrick said, "one is going to put out a special red flag 
to the NEA to steer clear of those works involving questions of gay rights or 
life style." 
</P>
<P>
The conference committee report also retained restrictions on federal support 
to two regional arts agencies that organized controversial shows last year. The 
report stipulates that any endowment grant to the Southeastern Center for 
Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., and the Institute for Contemporary Art 
at the University of Pennsylvania must be disclosed to Congress 30 days before 
it is made and that the endowment must explain what the arts project involves 
and how the endowment justified awarding it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could work with the language," said Ted Potter, the center's 
executive director, who reacted cautiously to the final report language. "I 
think a lot of damage has been done, but I think we've come out of it pretty 
well." Potter said his organization would comply with the strictures even if it 
doesn't like them because, he contended, the overall effect of the conference 
committee compromise represents a defeat for Helms in his attempt to impose 
broad-ranging, strict content controls on all federally supported artworks. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Helms has been saying he's won total victory," said Potter. "But that dog 
won't hunt. His goal was to demonize the American artistic community and 
dismantle the NEA and he failed on both counts."

EUROPE FORMS BATTLE PLAN TO FIGHT U.S. TV 
</P>

<P>
Television and film industry executives, artists and government officials from 
26 European countries on Monday endorsed plans to create new Europe-wide 
institutions and promote greater cooperation as a way to fight growing 
international competition, mainly from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, deep divisions that emerged in discussions on the mechanics of 
cooperation reflected the distance between the participants' aspirations and 
present realities. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place as Europe's once-staid television industry embarks on a 
marketing revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"A new industry is emerging in Europe," Luis Solana, head of Spanish state 
television, told the closing plenary session. "Television, always a cultural 
force in Europe, is emerging as a commercial battlefield." 
</P>
<P>
Solana said there was a consensus among those at the meeting against protective 
quotas to shelter European industry from American productions. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of barrier weakens the will to fight and be strong," he said. "It is 
a violation of the freedom of thought and expression that is part of the 
European cultural tradition." 
</P>
<P>
He called instead for help to sweep away the legal and fiscal barriers that 
stifle co-production. 
</P>
<P>
"Only by co-production can we meet the American challenge," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
But Italian director Ettore Scola talked of American cultural colonization. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept the principle of European preference for steel and cars," he said. 
"Why not for cultural products?" 
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the European Community are expected to 
approve a legally binding directive today that will pledge the member nations 
to limit imported productions to 50% "where practicable." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government and American producers have strongly opposed such action. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Drucker, director general of the French television station M6, said 
Europeans face a major task to increase the quality and quantity of its 
production in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
He talked of the need for private and public money to support a "huge structure 
to replace the cottage-industry nature of European television and audio-visual 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
The advent of cable and satellite broadcasting is expected to double the number 
of channels in Europe over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Drucker said improvements in training and new sources of funding such as 
venture capital are vital to produce "quality products that will last, not 
cheap productions with short shelf-lives." 
</P>
<P>
The gap between future demand and production in Europe, he said, means that 
every hour of programing needs at least eight to 10 hours of transmission -- 
either through repeats on secondary, specialty channels or by marketing to 
several countries. 
</P>
<P>
Drucker said that within five years, Europe's television industry will be 
capable of producing only 2,500 hours of prime-time, up-market fiction viewing, 
but that demand will by then exceed 16,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be hiding our heads in the sand if we think we can keep buying from 
Hollywood," he said. "That's suicidal. Hollywood can't even keep up. We've used 
15 years of Hollywood in the last three years. Europeans who want to capture a 
share of the market must produce for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "at stake is nothing less than Europe's audio-visual industry and 
its culture" and that "we have to gather our forces and fight." 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Delors, president of the EC's Executive Commission, proposed that $275 
million in EC funds be earmarked to help the industry over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
In specific action, the meeting expressed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The need for a European postgraduate school to train writers, directors and 
producers in a way that will strengthen the link between education and 
industry. The school would encourage the development of co-productions. Nine of 
the 26 nations represented have no national film and television academies for 
professional training. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Support for creation of a European Film-Television Agency to strengthen 
ties between national industries. Initially, this agency would serve as an 
information clearinghouse, but would eventually coordinate, plan and conduct 
research on such subjects as audience reaction and new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreement to expand the European Script Fund to cover documentaries and 
artistic programs, boost its funding and open it to artists from all 
contributing European countries. The fund, presently $2.2 million a year, 
supports fiction appealing to European audiences written by residents of the 
12-nation European Community. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting's conclusions are to go before an EC-dominated international 
coordinating committee for possible funding. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives at the Paris meeting said European audio-visual works should 
foster and preserve a "European cultural identity, founded on a diversity of 
cultures, ideologies and languages." 
</P>
<P>
A small working group assigned to define European identity admitted that a 
clear definition was elusive, but added, "The common base of European culture 
becomes patently obvious when it is compared with the culture of the Ibu, 
Chinese or American Indian." 
</P>

LOCKHEED FACES $35-MILLION LOSS IN THIRD QUARTER; 
</P>
<P>
FIRM TO WRITE OFF SEVERAL OF ITS MAJOR FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed disclosed Monday that it will take a $165-million writeoff against 
several major defense programs, resulting in a $35-million net loss in its 
third quarter and depressing further its already weak earnings this year. 
</P>
<P>
The charge could increase the volatility of the situation involving Dallas 
investor Harold C. Simmons, who has acquired 10.4% of Lockheed shares over the 
past year. Simmons has said he may decide to seek control of the aerospace 
firm, though he has disclosed no plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Lockheed had decided to take the writeoffs against many of its 
ailing fixed-price contracts at once, following an internal review that was 
completed recently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Programs Involved 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed is just the latest aerospace firm to be hit by multimillion-dollar 
writeoffs on controversial contracts in which a company agrees to design and 
develop a weapon for a fixed amount of money, rather than receiving funding 
that covers all of its costs. Although the Pentagon has attempted to phase out 
fixed-price contracts, dozens remain in the contracting pipeline and have 
saddled the industry with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Lockheed does not intend to pursue any future fixed-priced development 
contracts," Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said in a statement. He said the 
$165-million writeoff is the result of problems on programs including building 
the wings for the C-17 Air Force cargo jet and modifications to the Navy EP-3E 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The Calabasas-based aerospace firm also referred to an undisclosed number of 
other programs on which the company took writeoffs, some of which are 
classified, a spokesman said. However, the bulk of the $165-million total 
applied to the C-17 and EP-3E programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big writeoff," Paine Webber defense industry analyst Joseph Campbell 
said. "It adds more fuel to what Simmons is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell noted that even without the writeoff, Lockheed earnings would have 
been below Wall Street's expectations. According to Campbell's analysis, the 
company would have earned $1.21 a share in the third quarter without the 
writeoff, while analysts had been expecting $1.35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the magnitude of the writeoff increases the difficulty that many 
investors are having in evaluating aerospace stocks, Campbell said. Lockheed 
shares have gained 20.6% this year, outpacing those of most aerospace 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The appreciation has resulted from Simmons' buying activities. "People suspect 
that Harold Simmons knows something we don't know," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed won a fixed-price subcontract in May, 1987, to produce the wings for 
the C-17 jet, an award worth an estimated $1.3 billion. The work is being done 
at Lockheed's Georgia aircraft facility. 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed statement blamed the C-17 cost overruns, as well as those on the 
Navy EP-3E aircraft, on "hundreds of design changes because of continued 
development activity by the customers." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas is prime contractor for the C-17 and has been attempting to 
reduce the weight of the aircraft to meet contract specifications. The 
weight-trimming activities, which have also caused major writeoffs at McDonnell 
Douglas, have resulted in a large number of engineering change-orders to 
subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed said it will "continue to pursue its claims for equitable pricing 
adjustments under these contracts," implying that it is seeking to recover a 
major portion of the writeoff from McDonnell Douglas through an administrative 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Robert Slayman added, "We would seriously consider 
litigation if we do not reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the claims." 
</P>
<P>
Slayman confirmed that both the C-17 and EP-3E programs are losing money. The 
EP-3E is a program to modify a dozen existing Navy P-3 patrol aircraft. The 
original contract value was $59.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed said it expects to announce third-quarter financial results late next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Tellep said the third-quarter charges take into account all of the firm's major 
fixed-price development programs, except the Navy P-7A aircraft program. That 
program is so early in its development that the firm is reporting it on a 
break-even basis. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of 1988, Lockheed said it earned $123 million, or $2.07 
per share, from continuing operations on sales of $2.3 billion.

HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: HOW A GOOD WORKERS' COMP REFORM PLAN UNRAVELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Bernstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An impressive coalition of politically powerful forces has botched a good 
chance to do something really decent for California workers who are injured or 
killed on the job. 
</P>
<P>
True, the state Legislature has finally passed a bill that will help those 
workers, and it will certainly improve the state's out-of-kilter, 
$8-billion-a-year workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
But the reform measure that Gov. George Deukmejian signed last week is not 
nearly as good for workers as the one proposed six months ago by an unusual 
combination of leaders from most major business organizations, the California 
AFL-CIO, the insurance industry and even Deukmejian, who has vetoed all 
attempts to increase benefits since he took office in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, members of what seemed to be an unbeatable coalition of liberals 
and conservatives amiably posed together for media pictures and then made their 
major pronouncement: They all had agreed on a legislative proposal to overhaul 
the massive workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
One sample of the scope of their proposal: They agreed to more than double the 
current $224 weekly maximum temporary benefits for injured workers. The amount 
paid in other benefit categories such as permanent disabilities would also go 
up substantially. 
</P>
<P>
The average worker gets far below the maximum, which is paid only to those in 
the high income brackets. Still, the proposed increases would have been enough 
to give meaningful help to all workers. 
</P>
<P>
And the coalition wisely agreed to stop their perennial battles over labor's 
pleas to raise the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition proposed to do that by indexing benefits; that is, they would 
automatically be adjusted each year to keep them at 100% of the state's average 
weekly wage instead of 50%, as it is now. 
</P>
<P>
Indexing would mean that the business community or their political allies could 
not block future increases as they have for so many years, leaving benefits for 
injured workers trailing far behind increases in the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
There were flaws in the coalition's proposal, but those could have been 
corrected by making relatively few changes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sailing through the Legislature with the strength of that potent 
coalition behind it, however, the reform plan came under furious attack as soon 
as it was made public. 
</P>
<P>
First to hit it was a small, 400-member association of politically influential 
lawyers who represent injured workers. They charged that the reform plan would 
make it too hard for injured workers to get adequate legal advice on how to 
file for benefits. The lawyers didn't mention it, of course, but a reduction in 
the number of cases would mean a reduction in their own income. 
</P>
<P>
So with the help of their friends, such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the 
lawyers slowed the momentum of the reformers. 
</P>
<P>
The attack quickly escalated as the lawyers found allies in dissident factions 
that surfaced within each of the groups that made up the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers fumed over the size of the proposed benefit increases even 
though the plan would have significantly slowed expected increases in the 
premiums that employers pay for workers' compensation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
That employer-comforting goal would be reached by a cost-containment program 
that included such reforms as a sharp reduction in the number of expensive 
medical reports and in legal costs, and curbs on cases based on stress on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Another attack on the coalition plan came when a few unions representing 
government employees broke ranks with the state AFL-CIO, whose executive 
secretary, John F. Henning, had played a key role in forming the coalition in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Many public employees feared that they would lose some benefits because of the 
proposed limits on stress disability claims. 
</P>
<P>
There were also dissidents in the ranks of the insurance companies and even 
within Deukmejian's administration. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon a flood of amendments engulfed the original reform plan. There were 
six months of acrimonious legislative hearings and ugly squabbles in 
behind-the-scene meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a watered-down compromise came after days of around-the-clock 
bargaining pushed by Senate President Pro-Tem David Roberti and other 
legislators, and by Henning, who was determined not to let any more time go by 
without any benefit increase at all. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise increases temporary benefits from $224 to $336 a week by 1991, 
far below the $511 proposed by the coalition. Almost as bad was the elimination 
of indexing. 
</P>
<P>
Neither proposal would do much to curb those continually rising medical 
expenses or the insurance industry's profits that a state auditor general's 
report suggested are surprisingly high. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals were designed to curb abuses such as "doctor shopping." That's 
the unsavory game in which both workers' attorneys and employers shop around 
for doctors who, for a fee, write medical reports that substantiate their often 
widely differing claims of the extent of a worker's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
There are some other pluses in the new law, such as more administrative law 
judges to speed up resolution of disputes over claims made by workers. The new 
judges should help reduce the huge backlog of cases that is causing lengthy 
delays in getting benefits to injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
None of the feuding factions involved in reforming the system are satisfied 
with the final compromise, and they all say they want more improvements. 
</P>
<P>
It will be disgraceful, though, if it takes another seven years to give really 
adequate help to those hurt or killed on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, workers in at least 28 other states are already receiving higher 
benefits than California workers will be able to get in 1991 when all of the 
newly approved increases are in place.

USX PUTS RESERVES OF TEXAS OIL &amp; GAS UNIT ON THE BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of an ongoing restructuring to lower debt and bolster its stock price, 
steel and energy giant USX Corp. said Monday that it will sell off the oil and 
gas reserves of its unprofitable Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. subsidiary, which 
USX bought in 1986 for $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company declined to put a value on the reserves -- "we wouldn't want to 
limit the imagination of potential buyers," said USX spokesman Don H. Herring. 
But analysts estimated their worth at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1988, the reserves included 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural 
gas and 28 million barrels of oil in six states: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, 
Louisiana, Colorado and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consistent With Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from a sale would provide the company with cash to buy back stock and 
to help pay down long-term debt, which stood at $5.85 billion at the end of the 
second quarter, Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale would also be consistent with the company's recent strategy of selling 
off assets to streamline operations and guard against possible takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
"The mandate is to bring shareholder value, and one way is to take major assets 
that are not contributing to the bottom line and convert them into something 
that will," said George Gaspar, an oil industry analyst with Robert W. Baird 
&amp; Co. in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Former USX Chairman and Chief Executive David M. Roderick drew criticism when 
he engineered the deal valued at $3 billion to buy Texas Oil in exchange for 
133 million newly issued shares of stock. Charles Corry assumed Roderick's job 
June 1. 
</P>
<P>
USX based its hopes of profitability on the eventual bursting of the natural 
gas "bubble," or oversupply, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the company admits that the unit's performance has disappointed its 
corporate parent. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Oil reported an operating loss of $31 million in 1988, compared to 
operating income of $2 million in 1987, Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the situation in the natural gas marketplace has had a depressing 
impact on TXO's profitability," Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Undervalued 
</P>
<P>
Texas Oil's inconsistent profitability has hurt USX's per-share earnings at a 
time when USX's steel operations are rebounding and demand has been strong for 
refined petroleum products, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second quarter, USX reported net income of $250 million, up 
17% over a year ago. Sales totaled $5 billion, up 16%. 
</P>
<P>
But the company's stock price remains undervalued, with some analysts saying it 
is worth as much as $50 to $55 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Following Monday's announcement, USX stock closed up $1.75 at $34.875 on 
trading of 2.8 million shares, the second highest volume on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
USX hopes to strike a deal by the end of the year. Herring would not discuss 
potential buyers, except to say, "There seems to be a lot of interest now in 
obtaining oil and gas reserves -- particularly gas reserves -- so it looks like 
it's an improving market at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Demand for natural gas is also expected to increase in the wake of impending 
clean air rules. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts mentioned Pennzoil Co. as a logical buyer, especially since it still 
has about half of its $3-billion settlement from its damage suit against 
Texaco. A Pennzoil spokesman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential buyers include Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Phillips 
Petroleum Co., analysts said.

ZENITH TO GET OUT OF COMPUTERS, FOCUS ON ELECTRONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After struggling for years to maintain both its computer and consumer 
electronics operations, Zenith Electronics Corp. said Monday that it is giving 
up on computers to devote full attention to high-definition television and 
other consumer electronics products. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago area-based company, the only U.S. company that still makes TVs, 
said it is selling its computer operation to Groupe Bull, a leading French 
high-technology company, in a deal valued at $635 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, which still requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is designed 
togive Zenith the cash and stability that it has badly needed to make a big 
push in consumer electronics, an industry dominated by imports from the Far 
East and well-known for its cut-throat price competition. Last year Zenith 
successfully thwarted a takeover battle led by a dissident investment group, 
Brookhurst Partners, and the company indicated that it might sell some 
operations to boost shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith Chairman and Chief Executive Jerry K. Pearlman said the company is 
shedding its computer operation -- which makes the highly regarded SupersPort 
line of laptop computers -- because the company does not have the resources to 
adequately finance both it and the consumer electronics business. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a highly leveraged company in two very tough businesses," he said. "We 
couldn't do either of them appropriate justice." 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman said the company had received offers for its consumer electronics 
business, but only at fire-sale prices, so it made more sense to sell the 
computer business. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street reacted favorably to the sale. Investors drove the price of Zenith 
shares up $3.25 to close at $17.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was 
the third most actively traded stock. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they chose to sell the right operation," said Laura Lederman, an 
analyst with the Duff &amp; Phelps brokerage in Chicago. Lederman said that 
despite public perceptions to the contrary, Zenith's respected computer 
operations were not that strong, and its consumer electronics business was not 
that weak. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Lederman said, Zenith's computer operations, which last year generated 
sales of nearly $1.4 billion, could command a higher price than its consumer 
electronics unit, which generated 1988 sales of $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Johnson, an analyst at the brokerage house of Rotan Mosle in Houston, 
said that although the consumer electronics market has been soft the the last 
several years, the industry appears to be gaining strength. Meanwhile, he noted 
that the computer industry is becoming weaker, and that Zenith, in particular, 
was increasingly vulnerable to tough new competition from makers of lightweight 
laptop models. 
</P>
<P>
"In six months they might have had a hard time selling the computer operations 
to anyone," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith officials said the company would use proceeds of the sale to pay off 
debt, which now totals about $500 million, and sharpen its focus on new video 
technology such as high-definition television and advanced high-resolution 
color displays. Along with TVs, the company's consumer electronics unit also 
currently makes VCRs and video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"Zenith will emerge as a conservatively financed company better prepared to 
capitalize on our strengths in consumer electronics," Pearlman said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said high-definition television, which produces much sharper pictures 
than today's television screens, is something of a gamble given the unknown 
size of the market and the Bush Administration's reluctance to commit 
significant federal funds to its development. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was seen as a coup for Paris-based Bull, parent of Bull HN Information 
Systems Inc. in Waltham, Mass. It also is the company's second acquisition of a 
U.S. computer maker. In 1987, Bull became the major shareholder of Honeywell 
Bull, which took over the $2 billion computer business of Honewell Inc. Groupe 
Bull's partners in the company are Honeywell and NEC Corp. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith's 10-year-old computer division, which employs 4,000 of the company's 
37,000 workers, has been a bright performer for Zenith during a decade that was 
disastrous to a U.S. television industry besieged by imports. 
</P>
<P>
But television prices stabilized this year, halting an eight-year slide, and 
are expected to rise next year, due partly to a shortage of glass for picture 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zenith's computer sales -- largely due to a slowdown in government 
and military purchases and sharp new competition from Compaq Computer Co. -- 
have begun to sag. Last month, the company announced it was deferring employee 
raises as part of a cost-cutting program to combat losses from slack computer 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith turned a profit of $11.7 million last year after three years of widening 
losses, but had a net loss of $17 million for the first half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith stated that the purchase price for the computer division would be based 
on the net asset value of the computer business when the deal is closed, 
expected to be by the end of the year. That value was about $635 million at the 
end of July, the company said, but inventory reduction will lower the figure by 
year-end.

"A widening disparity between the haves and the have-nots," caused by 
skyrocketing land prices, "has robbed the people of their dream of home 
ownership," Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told the Japanese Parliament on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Pledging to work toward "a fair society" in Japan, Kaifu promised to tackle the 
land problem and to "take consumer interests into account in the drafting and 
implementation of all our policies." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, delivering his first policy speech to Parliament since taking office 
Aug. 9, offered no specifics. Yet this was the first time that a Japanese 
leader had pinpointed a growing "assets gap" and consumer interests as key 
governmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Falls 
</P>
<P>
In early September, at the beginning of U.S.-Japan negotiations designed to 
remove structural impediments to trade between the two countries, Bush 
Administration officials urged Japan to curb land prices and "give consumers a 
fair break" to remove barriers to imports. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said in his speech that "the extraordinary rise in land prices has been a 
factor shaking the people's faith in society's fairness." He said his 
government will take measures to curb speculation and "disallow exorbitant 
profits from land trading." 
</P>
<P>
In September, a poll by the newspaper Nihon Keizai found that middle-class 
support for Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party had fallen nearly 10% in the last 
year, to 38.8%, because of a widening assets gap caused by a privileged few 
reaping windfall profits from soaring land and stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited dissatisfaction over the assets gap as one of the basic 
causes of the Liberal Democrats' defeat in a July election for members of 
Parliament's upper house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An 'Importing Giant' 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has come to be regarded as one of the wealthiest of nations," Kaifu 
said. "Yet do we Japanese have an inner sense of fulfillment? . . . The time 
has come to work in humble pursuit of a fair and spiritually rich society." 
</P>
<P>
He intends to transform his country into an "importing giant," he said, and "if 
there are factors preventing consumers from enjoying comforts commensurate with 
Japan's economic development, we will eliminate them." 
</P>
<P>
He pledged support for U.S. requests -- without identifying them as such -- 
that Japan "promote competition through deregulation, create a rational 
distribution system and reduce the disparities between domestic and 
international prices." 
</P>
<P>
Without specifically referring to recent sex scandals and widespread influence 
buying by Recruit Co., an information and real estate conglomerate, he said: 
"Restoration of trust in politics is this Cabinet's most important task." 
</P>
<P>
He pledged to overhaul the Japanese electoral system, to reapportion seats in 
Parliament and reform political funding. He set November, 1990, the centennial 
of the establishment of Parliament, as a target date for implementation of the 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu spoke at the beginning of a special session of Parliament in which 
opposition parties, which now control the upper house, have submitted bills to 
abolish a 3% consumption tax that the Liberal Democrats implemented last April 
1. Analysts have said Kaifu may dissolve the lower house and call a general 
election during the special session, which is scheduled to end Dec. 16. By law, 
an election must be held by next July. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kaifu promised to rectify inequities in the consumption tax, he said 
the tax is "absolutely indispensable" to finance welfare programs as Japan's 
society ages. "I have no plans to abolish it," he declared.

U.S. MANUFACTURING SLOWS, EXPORTS RISE, SURVEY FINDS

<P>
The U.S. economy's manufacturing sector remained weak in September, although 
orders for exports increased sharply despite a stronger dollar, the nation's 
corporate purchasing managers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers index, a widely watched barometer of the economy's 
direction, rose to 46% from 45.2% in August and matched the rate for July. 
</P>
<P>
A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy is 
in decline while a reading above 50% indicates growth, according to the 
National Assn. of Purchasing Management. 
</P>
<P>
Survey responses indicated that new export orders rose during the month while 
prices continued falling, and production, employment, new orders and 
inventories all declined. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed picture painted by the managers left economists divided in their 
opinions about where U.S. manufacturing is headed in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a report that is filled with crosscurrents. It doesn't have a 
black-and-white picture that the economy is doing great," said Allen Sinai, 
economist with Boston Co. and Economic Advisers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly report is based on a survey of purchasing executives in more than 
250 industrial companies. The index is a composite of five separate indicators, 
including new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
The September overall index represented only a slight upturn from the August 
reading, which had been the lowest for the index since December, 1982, although 
the overall index averaged 49.5% for the first three quarters of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Past experience indicates that if this average were to continue for the final 
quarter, it would be consistent with real GNP growth of about 1.7% for all of 
1989," said Robert J. Bretz, survey chairman. 
</P>
<P>
But Bretz also said the index would have to fall below 44% to show economic 
contraction for the year. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp increase in export orders came despite the strength in the U.S. dollar 
during September. Some 60.5% of those surveyed reported that their volume of 
new export orders rose during the month, compared to 56% in August. It was the 
highest level since April when the new export order index was 62%.

BUSINESS JOURNAL PUBLISHER TO HEAD AUSTRALIAN VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald L. Keough, publisher of the Los Angeles Business Journal and a key 
player in the development of more than 20 local business newspapers around the 
country, has resigned to head a business publishing venture in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Keough also resigned his post as senior publisher for CBJ Associates, the 
partnership headed by Kansas City real estate developer Larry Bridges that owns 
the Los Angeles Business Journal, the San Diego Business Journal, and -- since 
last month -- the Orange County Business Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Link, associate publisher of the L.A. Business Journal, has been promoted 
to publisher, and he said he expected few changes: "We're on such a growth 
trend it would be silly to change anything -- our goals were 100% growth over 
last year's advertising sales, and we're on that type of track." 
</P>
<P>
No successor has yet been named to assume Keough's responsibilities as senior 
publisher for the three CBJ papers in Southern California. In that capacity, 
Keough had been helping to overhaul the Orange County paper and searching for 
the synergies that he believed lay in having a chain of weekly business papers. 
</P>
<P>
In Australia, Keough will head Regional Business Newspapers Ltd., a new company 
that will initially launch a weekly business paper in Brisbane. The company is 
backed by Lloyds Bank and private investors, and Keough said he would hold a 
25% to 30% equity stake in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The company will use U.S. city business journals as models in an effort to 
build up a chain of publications in Australia and then elsewhere on the Pacific 
Rim. Keough was the key editorial talent behind the growth of the American City 
Business Journal chain, and he still remains the owner of the San Francisco 
Business Times.

Air Force Veteran Named to High-Ranking Hughes Post 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft has named James A. Abrahamson, the recently retired director of 
the Strategic Defense Initiative, to the newly created job of executive vice 
president-corporate development. 
</P>
<P>
Abrahamson, who retired as an Air Force lieutenant general last March after a 
33-year military career, is the highest ranking Hughes executive who did not 
move up through the Hughes organization or that of Hughes' parent, General 
Motors. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Chairman Malcolm Currie said Abrahamson's experience in strategic 
planning and management "will strengthen our efforts to expand into new areas 
and build our company for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Abrahamson will be the third-highest ranking Hughes executive, after Currie and 
Hughes President Donald White. D. Kenneth Richardson, also an executive vice 
president, is responsible for operations at Hughes' six major corporate groups. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Abrahamson said his considerable background in U.S. 
space activities, which includes formerly heading up the Space Shuttle program, 
will be an important foundation in his new strategic planning job at Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of my challenge will be to examine this application of advanced 
technology in the civil field," he said. Hughes derives about 80% of its 
revenues from government contracts, while the other 20% is generated from sales 
of commercial communications satellites. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe the key to the future is to reduce the cost of individual 
spacecraft and space operations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Abrahamson was credited by many political pundits with personally saving the 
so-called Star Wars program from deeper congressional cutbacks in recent years. 
Since his departure, the program has lost support from the White House and is 
under sharp attack in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
As a retired senior military officer, Abrahamson will be barred by federal law 
from participating closely in programs that he was involved with during his 
government service. "What I can't do is go back and sell to the government," he 
said. "I am not going to do that, and in my job I have no requirement to do 
that." RALPH VARTABEDIAN

COELHO JOINS INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Coelho, the former House majority whip from Merced who resigned in June 
following ethical questions about his financial dealings, has been named a 
managing director of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., the Wall Street securities 
and investment banking firm announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, 47, who has no securities or investment banking experience, will work 
primarily on developing and enhancing Wertheim's relationships with corporate, 
institutional and wealthy individual clients, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
"What he can do is relate to people and monitor relationships," James A. 
Harmon, Wertheim's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. 
"Most investment bankers don't do that very well; they are only interested in 
the next transaction. Most do not build long-term relationships." 
</P>
<P>
As one of 40 managing directors at Wertheim, Coelho will be a shareholder of 
the privately held firm, generally regarded as among Wall Street's top 20 
investment banking houses. Coelho will start Monday and will work out of the 
firm's New York office, commuting weekly from his home in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, a 10-year congressman who was the No. 3-ranking House Democrat and 
front runner for House majority leader until the ethics probe prompted his 
resignation, is still under criminal investigation by the Justice Department, 
although the probe is still far from being completed, sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't See a Problem 
</P>
<P>
Coelho's problems stemmed in part from his purchase of a $100,000 high-yield 
junk bond underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert with the help of a $50,000 
loan from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Beverly Hills. The congressman 
failed to disclose the loan as required by law and was later involved in a 
lobbying effort on behalf of Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
But Coelho, who has said he expects to be vindicated, said in a telephone 
interview that ethics questions would not pose a problem in his new job. 
</P>
<P>
"That didn't stop anybody from making job offers," he said, noting approaches 
from law, lobbying, public relations and investment banking firms, as well as 
from private businesses that wanted to make him chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Wertheim's Harmon also said ethics would not taint Coelho. "We're not concerned 
about it, and we are a firm of among the highest ethics," he said, noting that 
Wertheim has not been implicated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or 
stock exchanges in insider trading or other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not see anything Tony's done that would cast negatively on his ethics," 
Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho said he doesn't expect to do any lobbying work as part of his new 
duties, although he will tap his many contacts to help increase Wertheim's 
client base. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to leave this past chapter, and not have the new chapter in my life 
be dependent upon Capitol Hill," Coelho said. "I took this seriously as a major 
career move." 
</P>
<P>
Coelho refused to disclose his salary, believed to be well into the six-figure 
range, except to joke that "it's a lot more than a congressional salary." 
</P>
<P>
Added a close friend of the former congressman: "One of the great joys of 
Tony's new life is that he only has to tell his wife and the IRS what he's 
making these days." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington contributed to this story.

AMERICA WEST PLANS PALMDALE AIR SERVICE EARLY NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America West Airlines said Monday that it expects to offer round-trip flights 
to Las Vegas from Palmdale early next year, marking the return of scheduled 
commercial airline service to the Antelope Valley community 35 miles north of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With its move into Palmdale, Phoenix-based America West now serves 12 
California cities, including Los Angeles. Earlier this year, as part of its 
expansion in the state, it began service from Santa Barbara and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
America West plans to begin Palmdale service Jan. 2, with four departures a day 
using 37-seat Dash 8 turboprop aircraft. America West will use the Palmdale Air 
Terminal, which has not been used for scheduled service since 1985, when Desert 
Sun Airlines halted operations there. 
</P>
<P>
Besides America West, the start-up airline Westates has plans to use Palmdale's 
airport. However, a spokesman for Burlingame, Calif.-based Westates said Monday 
that the airline does not expect to begin commercial operations until sometime 
in December and that its Palmdale service is expected to begin sometime after 
that. DENISE GELLENE

IBM, MOTOROLA AND CRAY PLAN JOB CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Persistent sluggish computer sales have prompted three more high-technology 
companies to trim their work forces. 
</P>
<P>
Cray Research Inc., a Minneapolis supercomputer maker, said Monday that it was 
laying off about 400 employees in its Wisconsin manufacturing operations 
because of slowing demand for its state-of-the art scientific machines. The 
layoffs represent about 7% of the company's worldwide work force of about 
5,400. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola Inc., of Schaumburg, Ill., announced that it is reducing its work 
force by 2.4%, or 2,500 salaried employees, and taking a pretax charge of about 
$43 million in the third quarter to cover the cost of the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, International Business Machines Corp. confirmed that it has offered 
employees at four locations voluntary severance, an offer company officials 
said they expected about 600 to 1,000 workers to accept. 
</P>
<P>
The offer at IBM was the third time in recent years that the company has 
offered voluntary severance, or early retirement, packages to its employees, 
and a company spokesman said it was "probably not the last one." 
</P>
<P>
IBM officials said the latest offer was unrelated to its announcement last week 
that its third-quarter earnings, and possibly those for all of 1989, to be 
lower than last year. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs at Cray are the first major force reduction in the company's 
17-year history. Chairman John Rollwagen said the company had avoided factory 
staff reductions in the past because growth in market demand had more than 
compensated for increasingly automated manufacturing processes. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, however, our rate of growth has slowed, and the technical advances move 
as fast, if not faster, than before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said all costs associated with the manufacturing work force 
reduction would be incurred in 1989, and are expected to total about $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola said its cuts would be made immediately and would primarily affect the 
company's U.S.-based communications and semiconductor products operations, its 
two largest segments. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola said it was taking the "one-time action" to bring some of the 
company's businesses "into balance with changing business and market 
conditions," and said it hoped to make the necessary reductions entirely 
through voluntary severance and attrition. However, a spokesman said some 
layoffs might be necessary.

FRENCH FIRM DENIES JUNK BOND STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Axa Midi Assurances, the French insurer that would buy Farmers Group if the Los 
Angeles firm's parent is taken over, denied Monday that it would finance the 
acquisition with junk bonds, as critics have claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Axa Midi, based in Paris, intends to finance its purchase through a combination 
of cash and commercial bank loans, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Axa Midi has agreed to pay $4.5 billion to Sir James Goldsmith's consortium, 
Hoylake Investments, if it succeeds in taking over London-based BAT Industries, 
parent of Farmers Group. The deal would be worth about $22 billion, history's 
second-largest. BAT has maintained that Axa Midi would pay for Farmers by 
issuing high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds and saddling the company with 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no junk bonds involved in this transaction," insisted Axa Midi's 
chairman, Claude Bebear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financing Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Axa Midi, Bebear said, intends to pay $1 billion in cash "from our own internal 
resources," add another $1.25 billion two years later and finance the rest of 
the purchase price with 10-year bank loans. Moreover, he added, the loans will 
not be placed on Farmers' books, nor will Farmers' shares be used as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Axa Midi carries no debt and is assigned a AA+ financial 
standing by Standard &amp; Poor's, the U.S. bond-rating firm. 
</P>
<P>
Bebear spelled out the financing strategy in a letter to California State Sen. 
Alfred E. Alquist (D-Santa Clara), the text of which was released Monday. 
Alquist and 59 other legislators had earlier written to state Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to express concern over Farmers' future if 
Hoylake succeeded in taking over BAT. Gillespie and regulators in eight other 
states where Farmers' subsidiaries are headquartered must approve changes in 
ownership of insurers based within their boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith has sought to have federal courts preempt state regulatory authority 
over the deal, which Hoylake argues is an international transaction. But Bebear 
said in his letter that Axa Midi considers Goldsmith's approach wrong and 
"urged him to withdraw these law suits. We are willing to conform to all U.S. 
regulations." 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Alquist had claimed that Axa Midi's purchase of Farmers from 
Hoylake would "immediately burden Farmers with $4.5 billion in debt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEC Review 
</P>
<P>
BAT has repeated that view since Axa Midi agreed a month ago to buy Farmers 
from Hoylake as part of Goldsmith's plan for BAT to concentrate on its 
traditional tobacco business and sell off everything else. BAT last week 
countered with its own, less radical divestment plan, which would also keep the 
company's financial services interests. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
completed a review sought by Congress by finding that the agency has no 
authority over Hoylake's bid for BAT, which excludes the 5% of shares held in 
this country as American depository receipts.

The global merger boom that started in the early 1980s slowed during the first 
three quarters of 1989 as the buyout industry apparently was finishing its 
digestion of gains made in the last year, according to a survey released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The survey by IDD Information Services also found that although the number of 
corporate mergers and acquisitions in the United States and overseas for the 
first three periods in 1989 was down from the previous year, the dollar amount 
was barely changed. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, IDD said, 3,666 companies were acquired for $248.5 billion. 
That was down 12% from 4,171 targets valued at $248.8 billion acquired in the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
The total for the first nine months of 1989 included the huge $25-billion 
leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
IDD said acquisitions in the United States in the third quarter were down 13.8% 
from the previous quarter. There were 621 U.S. targets acquired in the third 
quarter, down from 721 in the prior three months. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. was the choice 
investment bank for the first three quarters by advising on 34 transactions 
collectively valued at $70.4 billion, including the RJR Nabisco deal. The firm 
was ranked ninth in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson Lehman Hutton had the highest number of deals, 106, worth $20.8 
billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
Several years ago Claus Mees of Palo Alto paid $18,000 for a dismantled 1955 
Mercedes Gullwing that he found in Oklahoma. The two-seat roadster, whose doors 
open up like a gull's wings, have become collectors' items due to their 
innovative styling and because only 1,400 were built between 1954 and 1957. 
</P>
<P>
But Mees' car was a bit short of being in pristine condition. So in 1983 he 
hired Scott Grundfor, whose Scott Restorations in Panorama City specializes in 
overhauling Gullwings and other vintage Mercedes cars. 
</P>
<P>
Mees shipped his car to California in about 50 boxes with many of its parts 
missing. Three years later -- Mees said it took that long because he couldn't 
afford to have it finished sooner -- the maroon Gullwing was done. 
</P>
<P>
Mees won't say what he paid Grundfor for the repair job -- although these days 
Grundfor charges up to $200,000 per car -- except that it was "substantially 
less than what it costs today." But Mees has no complaints. He takes his 
Gullwing out only for car-display shows, and has never driven it. "It was 
perfect, and I wanted to keep it that way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Reputation 
</P>
<P>
Scott Restorations is no slapdash body shop where they pound out dented fenders 
and apply a $200 paint job. Cars brought to Grundfor are literally restored 
from the frame up, so that they look as good -- or better -- as they did when 
they left the factory three or four decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Grundfor's work has made him one of the four or five top restorers of vintage 
cars -- particularly Mercedes -- in the nation, said John Olson, editor of SL 
Market Newsletter, a Minneapolis-based journal for Mercedes SL owners. 
</P>
<P>
"His reputation precedes him even as far as Stuttgart, where the Mercedes 
people know him," said David Brice, an Australian hotel developer who has had 
three 300SLs restored by Grundfor and has two more currently in his shop. 
</P>
<P>
A 1954 Gullwing, which originally cost $6,280, today fetches more than 
$200,000, even if it's in just average condition. But when Grundfor and his 
37-member staff get done restoring it, the car could sell for more than 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
With Grundfor, you pay for what you get. If he completely restores a Mercedes 
300SL Gullwing, the job can take up to 18 months and cost more than $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cost, his shop -- which consists of three, single-story buildings, 
one for painting and parts fabrication, one for engine assembly work and the 
third for storage -- currently is crammed with two dozen 300SLs and several 
other makes in various states of restoration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Automobile Art 
</P>
<P>
Customers from Japan and Europe ship their valuable autos to him for 
restoration. He also brokers sales of hard-to-find cars. Together, the 
businesses generate about $2.5 million in annual revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grundfor knows that obsessions carry a big cost, and he's only too happy to 
help wealthy car lovers fulfill their desire to own -- and often resell for a 
profit -- fully restored rare automobiles. But even though Grundfor 
acknowledged that his business has made him nearly a millionaire, he likens his 
work more to art than to commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard part of the business is the business," said Grundfor, a lean San 
Fernando Valley native whose beard and shoulder-length, light red hair make him 
look younger than his 42 years. "You have cash flow problems that surface, you 
have accounting problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have a body shop this size and make as much or twice as much money," 
he added. "I love the cars. I like to be an artist." 
</P>
<P>
Grundfor's canvas is not limited to the Mercedes 300SL. On a recent day, his 
shop also housed a 1936 Mercedes 540K Cabriolet, a 1937 Rolls Royce Phantom 3 
and a 1950 Ferrari 166-MM Barchetta, among others. 
</P>
<P>
But he's best known for the 300SL. Many of the cars' parts can no longer be 
bought from the manufacturer -- such as the ashtray -- so it's up to Grundfor 
to either find a used one and refurbish it, or build one from scratch. A 
Mercedes Gullwing ashtray made by Grundfor costs several hundred dollars; a 
restored 300SL radio can cost $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Also, all replacement fenders for the 300SL must be molded by hand. Grundfor's 
team can re-upholster seats (cost: about $2,000), and reset wood paneling in 
the car's interior. Painting a restored 300SL can range from $4,500 to $15,000, 
depending on the number of layers of paint required and the type of finish the 
car's owner wants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bills Monthly 
</P>
<P>
The 300SL originally had 47 exterior colors and 34 interior colors, but 
Grundfor generally will paint the car in nearly any color that the client 
desires. Most stick with an original hue, however, because they know that 
protects the car's resale value, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grundfor gives his customers a rough estimate of the cost, but requires no down 
payment once the work begins. He bills customers much in the way that law firms 
do: Twice a month a detailed computerized invoice is sent listing labor ($45 an 
hour) and parts "down to the number of screws and washers we use," Grundfor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are other restorers around the country, using Grundfor or 
another of the top firms can add 10% or more to the car's selling price 
compared with second-tier companies, said Olson. That's important to some of 
Grundfor's customers, who use his work to boost the car's resale value. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of their intentions, Grundfor's clients don't come to him with blank 
checks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the car is the love of their lives . . . it has to make financial 
sense for them," he said. "I've not had one client come in and say, 'I don't 
care what it costs.' " 
</P>
<P>
Grundfor is respected by his peers as a perfectionist, a trait that he conceded 
and one that has enabled his cars to win several car shows in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always worried there will be something that isn't quite perfect on the 
car" when it leaves the shop, he said. "But I've never had a client say 
something derogatory about our cosmetics." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if there are any differences between Scott Restorations and the other 
top-tier restorers, Grundfor is known as a favorite among owners who want their 
cars to be contenders in car-display shows. Hjeltness Restoration in Escondido, 
meanwhile, appeals to car owners preoccupied with having the car as authentic 
as the day it left the factory. And a third, Gullwing Service Co. in Essex, 
Mass., specializes in restoring cars for people who enjoy driving them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Over-Restoration' 
</P>
<P>
Paul Russell, owner of Gullwing Service, said he often puts a rubberized 
coating inside the wheel wells of cars to protect them from nicks and cuts as 
they're driven around town. "I don't believe Scott would ever consider putting 
a protective finish in the underwell of the car," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson, the newsletter editor, said "there are those who feel that Hjeltness 
restorations are more authentic, and the reason is because Scott 
over-restores," said Olson. Grundfor "would concede he does what the factory 
would have done if it had had more time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jerry Hjeltness, owner of Hjeltness, said "everybody in the restoration 
business over-restores." For instance, "the paint work is much better than any 
car was delivered in because the (paint) technology has been advanced." 
</P>
<P>
Infatuated with cars since he was 10, Grundfor painted and fixed cars to pay 
his way through UCLA, where he earned a bachelor's degree in public service and 
management in 1969. In his last year there, at age 19, he opened a body shop in 
his garage. 
</P>
<P>
He ran the body shop for a decade, but in 1979 decided to restore vintage 
autos. After selling his body shop, Grundfor had about $30,000 to start the new 
business. Slowly he generated more jobs by promoting himself -- and his 
restored cars -- at car shows and meetings of Mercedes car clubs. 
</P>
<P>
As word of his work spread, so has his net worth. Grundfor himself owns a rare 
1956 Mercedes SLS prototype race car, a 1959 Jaguar XK150 coupe and a 1959 
Mercedes 220S Cabriolet convertible, the latter two having been fully restored. 
But he often drives a 1988 Ford pickup truck to work. 
</P>
<P>
Grundfor would eventually like to open a training center, where would-be auto 
craftsmen can learn their trade. "I love to watch people work who are doing 
something I'm interested in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He's also thinking of building his own version of the famous Mercedes Gullwing. 
The car would have many of its original parts, but Grundfor also would use 
today's technology to enhance the engine, chassis and transmission. He is 
considering building only one at a cost of $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the creative project of a lifetime; it's like going back in time and 
being at Stuttgart" where the cars were originally designed, Grundfor said.

TERMINAL GETS AN EARLY VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Part of the ceiling has a fresh coat of primer. Mottled-looking beige marble 
adorns some of the columns. Pieces of the baggage conveyor system are stacked, 
ready for installation. 
</P>
<P>
High up on the mezzanine, with its panoramic view of airplanes taking off and 
landing, the hard-hat-clad tour guide proudly announced: "This is where the VIP 
Club rooms will be." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to John Wayne Airport's new $50-million, 337,900-square-foot passenger 
terminal. No crowds here, thank you -- at least not yet. It is now just a 
cavernous building of steel girders and cement slabs, aluminum ventilation 
ducts, boxes of lighting fixtures, electrical conduit snaking through walls and 
power generators parked here and there. 
</P>
<P>
It is about 60% completed -- with six months' more work ahead. This is to be 
Orange County's showpiece, an edifice intended to erase all memory of the 
existing 22-year-old building that is 11 times smaller (and sometimes jokingly 
referred to as the Timbuktu or Third World terminal). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Official Look 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen reporters, photographers and television camera crews toured 
the construction site Monday in the first official look at the facility since 
the steel frame was topped off with pomp and ceremony last May 25. 
</P>
<P>
There was a briefing, then the trip to the site. Then the whale-like terminal 
structure seemed to swallow up the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Official Briefing: Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley -- who is 
counting on the project to be finished April 1 because he has already invited 
President Bush -- said he was proud of the job everyone has been doing. In an 
aside, he also disclosed that after months of haggling, prime contractor Taylor 
Woodrow California Construction Ltd. has finally agreed that the project will 
be finished on time. 
</P>
<P>
The Safari: A journey over a bumpy dirt road by airport shuttle bus through 
what resembled an archeological dig, complete with dust bowls and strange 
formations such as the concrete ramps that arch over the San Diego Freeway to 
make a direct connection between the Costa Mesa Freeway and the parking garages 
for the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we believe to be the longest structure west of the Mississippi," 
Airport Project Manager Alan Murphy said, pointing to a long trench where the 
underground level of a 1,000-foot-long parking garage is being built. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence of Work 
</P>
<P>
Along the way were the artifacts of construction: a large empty spool for wire, 
an abandoned underground fuel tank, a line of six Caterpillar tractors dwarfed 
by the McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and Boeing 757s a few yards away. 
</P>
<P>
The Whale: From inside the terminal, the high vaulted ceilings and exposed 
steelwork resemble a conglomeration of several large European-style indoor 
swimming stadiums -- without the water. Or a whale's rib cage. Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
The fireproofing material sprayed on some of the steel beams looked like a 
brownish fungus. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of open areas between the various levels, and Murphy is quick 
to acknowledge these as "wasted space." Such open areas were intended, however, 
as insurance that the terminal would not exceed the square footage limits 
imposed in a 1985 court settlement. That settlement, of an airport noise suit 
aimed at halting the county's $310-million airport expansion program, allowed 
construction of the terminal to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
The existing terminal, a 29,000-square-foot building, was designed to serve 
400,000 passengers a year. It now handles more than 4.5 million. When the new 
terminal opens next year, the number of commercial airline flights is expected 
to increase from the current 87 to as many as 160 a day. The terms of the 1985 
settlement also stipulate that annual passenger volume is limited to 8.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plagued by Trouble 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being controversial, the terminal project has encountered other 
troubles, all along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow's bid for construction work came in at $59.7 million, $19 
million higher than county officials had expected. Further, the project 
architect was fined and forced to forgo more than $700,000 because of errors 
and delays. 
</P>
<P>
An intensive cost-cutting effort ensued, angering some designers, who were told 
that cheaper materials would have to suffice. Labor strife with subcontractors 
over late payments resulted in a few walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the subcontracts have risen by amounts ranging from a few 
thousand dollars to more than $1 million, mostly because of on-site 
construction problems. Such increases were anticipated, however, in the 
county's $310-million overall budget for the airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
HPV, the consulting firm the country hired to oversee the project, and Taylor 
Woodrow have been feuding over bills for speeded steel delivery, buckled 
ceiling panels, and repairs to concrete slabs found to have large interior 
voids and cracks. 
</P>
<P>
Further, as recently as Aug. 7, Taylor Woodrow was warning HPV that the 
terminal was still behind schedule and that "substantial completion" could 
probably not be achieved until late next May at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grand Jury Warning 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury last year warned county officials that the 
building was not likely to open on time. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, county officials have accused Taylor Woodrow of building a case for 
future claims against the county -- which the firm did when it built a terminal 
in Tampa, Fla. -- instead of improving performance. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, though, airport officials were emphasizing harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a top-quality facility," said a proud Riley, who has 
fought for the new facility for most of his 15 years in office. "When the new 
terminal opens, it's going to be real nice."

TOP COUNTY OFFICIAL QUITS TO TAKE JOB AS LOBBYIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER and BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Larry Parrish, the county's top executive for the 
past four years, resigned Monday to take a job with the lobbying firm that 
represents Orange County in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish acknowledged the frustrations of administering a government that has 
been strapped financially and buffeted by critics. He said he decided to leave, 
however, simply because "the time has come . . . for me to do some new things." 
</P>
<P>
"This November I will turn 50," he said, "and I have always thought that 
milestone should mark more than just age." Parrish will join Carpenter &amp; 
Associates, whose head is former state Sen. Dennis E. Carpenter. "For me, it 
will mark an opportunity to work in the private sector with a good friend in a 
somewhat related business in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors and county department heads said Monday that Parrish's resignation 
came as a surprise and, although some occasionally criticized his 
administration, they called his departure a loss to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a few times I've had my eyebrows raised by something he's 
done, but, in general, I think he did a good job," Supervisor Don R. Roth said. 
"I'll tell you, it's not an easy task, the demands are so great," Roth said of 
the county administrative officer's job. 
</P>
<P>
Said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez: "It will be a significant loss to the county. 
The CAO is in a pivotal position to help steer the county rudder in terms of 
administrative philosophy. Throw in his positive attitude and his good sense of 
humor and I think he brought . . . the needed leadership during some tough 
fiscal times." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors said they will probably order a national search for a successor to 
Parrish, who is expected to leave his post Nov. 17. In the meantime, they are 
expected to appoint Assistant County Administrative Officer Murry L. Cable as 
acting county administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish's tenure began in 1985. Since then, the county's course has been marked 
by a struggle with problems resulting from rapid growth. Among them have been 
overcrowded jails and a resistance to development. The county also has faced 
severe financial shortages over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
The problems are, for the most part, still far from resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"It does wear on you," Parrish said Monday. "After you put so many nuts on so 
many wheels, sooner or later you want to get off the (assembly) line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raise for Firm 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Orange County, Parrish was for five years the chief 
administrative officer for Santa Barbara County. He ran unsuccessfully for the 
state Assembly in 1976 on the Republican ticket in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter's firm is paid about $207,000 a year to represent Orange County at 
the Legislature under a contract negotiated by Parrish's office last year. The 
fee paid to the Carpenter firm was raised from about $14,000 to $17,250 a month 
last December. Parrish said, however, that there is no relation between the 
contract and his hiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly never considered working for Denny when that contract was 
considered," Parrish said Monday. "It was never mentioned; it's just not the 
way business is done." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, whose firm also represents the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, said Parrish will handle some legislation for Orange County and 
that Parrish will also work as a "generalist." 
</P>
<P>
"He will be particularly valuable because of his experience in government for 
the last 25 years," Carpenter said. "He told me he . . . was ready to do 
something different. When I had a position, I called him." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish recently received a 9.3% pay raise, putting his salary at $129,910 a 
year. He is the fourth-highest-paid county administrative officer in 
california. Parrish declined to reveal what his salary with Carpenter's firm 
will be except to say that it is more than he is making as county 
administrative officer and that it is "extremely adequate."

TRANSIT EXECUTIVE GETS 22% PAY HIKE, 4-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over strong objections from two board members, Orange County Transit District 
General Manager James P. Reichert won an unprecedented four-year contract 
Monday calling for pay raises totaling 22%, which would bring his salary to 
more than $104,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
On a 3-2 vote, the district board agreed to the multiyear contract, which 
guarantees that should Reichert be terminated for any reason, he still must be 
paid the full amount for the entire four years. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Councilman Richard B. Edgar, Anaheim lawyer William Farris and 
Huntington Beach Councilman John Erskine, all transit district board members, 
approved the agreement, citing Reichert's record of non-controversial and 
praiseworthy performance. 
</P>
<P>
But district board chairman Roger R. Stanton, who also is a member of the Board 
of Supervisors, called the new contract "a guaranteed giveaway of raises in 
advance." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's appropriate to guarantee somebody a job four years into the 
future," Stanton said after the transit district board meeting. "His 
performance is fine. I have no complaint about it. But I basically believe that 
he should serve at the will of the board, as is the case with county department 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
OCTD board member Don R. Roth, who also is a county supervisor, offered a 
compromise that would have given Reichert a 30-month contract, but none of the 
other agency board members went along. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raises of 5%, 6% 
</P>
<P>
Edgar and Farris had proposed a five-year contract more than a month ago, but 
they later reduced their request to four years. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract calls for Reichert to receive 5% raises on March 15, 1990 and 
1991, and 6% raises on March 15, 1992 and 1993. The contract extends through 
Nov. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Reichert is now paid $85,442 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Transit district officials said Reichert decided to seek the multiyear contract 
after receiving glowing praise last June during his official performance 
review. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retirement Anticipated 
</P>
<P>
Reichert, who did not speak on his own behalf during the meeting, said 
afterward: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at retiring four or five years from now, and this gets me pretty 
close to it." 
</P>
<P>
Reichert, 56, has been with transit district since 1973, and the new contract 
will carry him through his 20th year with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Reichert said he also was interested in securing his employment in light of 
pending legislation to merge OCTD with the county Transportation Commission. 
"It gave me pause to think," Reichert said. "I thought that maybe I ought to 
make a move now, but some board members decided that they would rather have me 
stay around instead of having me look around." 
</P>
<P>
The transit district operates the county's main public bus service, and the 
county Transportation Commission coordinates county transit and highway 
policies. A merger bill stalled in the Legislature this year over the makeup of 
a combined new board of directors, but the bill is expected to pass in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Although Reichert's new contract raises his salary significantly, the county's 
highest paid public official is William C. Woollett Jr., recently named to 
direct the county's tollway agency. Woollett's salary is $118,000. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the Los Angeles-based Southern California Rapid Transit 
District (RTD) receives $118,000 a year, but that person serves at the pleasure 
of the RTD board. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stanton -- who has sparred frequently with Reichert in recent years 
-- acknowledged Monday that he did support a multiyear contract for Stanley T. 
Oftelie, executive director of the county Transportation Commission, of which 
Stanton is also a member. Stanton pointed out that Oftelie's contract, which 
extends through 1992, only guarantees him six months' pay should he be 
terminated early.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AISSA WAYNE FILES SUIT AGAINST 
ATTACK SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charging that she was the victim of terror and intimidation, Aissa Wayne on 
Monday sued a Los Angeles private detective and two men who allegedly attacked 
her and a companion in Newport Beach last fall in connection with Wayne's 
attempts to get custody of her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, the daughter of film legend John Wayne, also is suing ex-husband Thomas 
Gionis, the Pomona surgeon who allegedly orchestrated the attack. Wayne and 
financier Roger Luby were bound, threatened and assaulted by a pair of 
intruders at Luby's Newport Beach mansion on Oct. 3, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis and the three men named in the civil suit filed Monday in Orange County 
Superior Court in Santa Ana -- detective O. Daniel Gal, Jerrel Lee Hintergardt, 
and Jeffrey K. Bouey -- are all awaiting criminal proceedings in connection 
with the assault. 
</P>
<P>
At Gionis' instructions, Gal allegedly trailed Wayne and hired Hintergardt and 
Bouey to carry out the attack on her, prosecutors assert. Prosecutors charge 
that Gionis intended the attack as a warning to his ex-wife in their bitter 
dispute over custody of their daughter, Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge granted Gionis custody of the child early this year, 
finding that Wayne was "emotionally immature." But that order was rescinded and 
Wayne was given temporary custody after the criminal allegations against Gionis 
were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed Monday also names as defendants George J. Stephan, who has 
represented Gionis in some of his legal battles, and Stephan's employer, the 
Los Angeles law firm of Wood, Lucksinger and Epstein. The suit seeks damages 
based on allegations of terror, assault, battery, false imprisonment, wrongful 
interference with parental relationship and negligence.

</P>
<P>
CITY CONSIDERS CLOSING PARKS TO LARGE EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council unanimously agreed Monday to consider barring large-scale 
events from city parks, such as the Gay Pride Festival held last month. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would prohibit events that charge admission and fence in sections 
of the parks. Events such as the popular Cinco de Mayo and Mother's Day 
festivals, which are fund-raisers by nonprofit groups, would also be affected. 
Both festivals are held annually at Centennial Regional Park and attract up to 
50,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of nonprofit groups said the ordinance would cripple their fund-raising 
abilities. The Santiago Club, which sponsors the Cinco de Mayo festival, raised 
$50,000 for its activities this year from the festival, club officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would also bar the sale of alcoholic beverages in the parks. Santa 
Ana and Tustin are the only county cities that allow alcohol to be sold at 
events held in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
"With such an ordinance, this will take the profit out of the alcohol sale," 
Mayor Daniel H. Young said.

12-YEAR-OLD'S VALUES ARE PUT TO TEST AFTER FINDING $1,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLISON SAMUELS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Ryan Freimann spent a long weekend dreaming of at least a dozen 
things to do with the $1,000 he found Friday in an Orange shopping center 
parking lot. For example, there's that sports car he's saving for and hoping to 
buy when he turns 16. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday the Newport Beach sixth-grader handed the 10 $100 bills over to 
their rightful owner. 
</P>
<P>
"It took some thought," the Andersen Elementary School student said. "But I 
knew it was the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, after Ryan, his mother and twin sisters stopped at a 
shopping center near Orange Avenue and Prospect Street, Ryan noticed a bulky 
white envelope on the pavement near the family car. 
</P>
<P>
"It was face up with a clear opening so I could see at least one $100 bill," 
Ryan said. "I picked it up and thought, 'Wow!' and then gave it to my mom." 
Kerry Freimann, in turn, took the envelope, which also included a Santa Ana 
Unified School District payroll stub, to her husband, Dave, who put the fate of 
the money back in Ryan's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to make the decision," Dave Freimann said. "I wanted to give him 
a test to see if the values we've tried to instill in him had gotten through." 
</P>
<P>
They had. Ryan decided that his family should first try to contact the owner, 
but if they were unable to do so, he'd get to keep the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I did want the person who lost it to get it back," the boy said. "But there 
was a part of me that sort of hoped we couldn't find the person. It was a long 
weekend waiting to find out." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Ryan's father contacted the Santa Ana school district, which 
reached Michele Charlebois, a fifth-grade teacher at Garfield Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"She was ecstatic," Dave Freimann said. "She couldn't believe anyone would 
return that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the money at the Freimann home Monday afternoon, Charlebois 
rewarded Ryan with an undisclosed sum of money for his honesty. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just completed teaching my kids lessons on honesty and good will," 
Charlebois said. "It's ironic that this would happen in the same week. I have 
to thank his parents for raising such a great kid." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who is running for student body president at his school this year, 
admitted that when he told a few of his classmates of his good deed, they were 
stunned by his honesty. 
</P>
<P>
"But I told them if they were in the same situation and knew who the money 
belonged to, they wouldn't be able to sleep at night if they kept it," Ryan 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
</P>
<P>
ROBBER WHO USED AIDS THREAT IS SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Clyde Sweeton, a former salesman from San Juan Capistrano, was sentenced 
to four years and 10 months in prison Monday for robbing a bank of $4,692 after 
saying he was dying of AIDS and was carrying a knife infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Judge Manuel L. Real imposed the sentence in Los Angeles on 
Sweeton, 35, for his April 27 robbery of the First Interstate Bank branch on 
Tustin Avenue in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeton, who was later found not to have acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 
approached a financial services officer at the bank, identified himself as an 
FBI agent and said he was dying of AIDS and needed $25,000, which would be 
repaid from insurance proceeds, Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam said in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials told Sweeton that they could not get that much money, so they gave 
him $4,692 and he left the bank, Gillam said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeton pleaded guilty to one count of bank robbery in July. 
</P>
<P>
He then went to trial in another case and was convicted of armed robbery 
involving the taking of a hostage. 
</P>
<P>
But in a surprise move Monday, Real granted a defense motion for acquittal on 
that count. Gillam said she would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In the second robbery, Sweeton had been convicted of taking $8,200 from the 
First Interstate Bank branch at Monarch Bay Plaza in Dana Point on May 3, after 
telling officials there a similar story about dying of AIDS and having an 
AIDS-infected knife, Gillam said. 
</P>
<P>
When Sweeton spotted sheriff's deputies outside, he grabbed an elderly woman 
and held a 14-inch knife to her back but was talked into surrendering, Gillam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He later admitted to both robberies, she said.

LANDLORDS IN RENT STRIKE TOLD TO FIX DEFECTS, OR ELSE 
</P>

The Santa Ana City Council on Monday gave the owners of a 10-unit apartment 
building involved in a rent strike 60 days to renovate stairs and a balcony or 
face having the property declared a public nuisance and repaired by the city -- 
at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
Nick O'Malley, an attorney for landlords James B. Isbill and Bonnie P. Isbill, 
said his clients intend to begin repairs as soon as they receive building 
permits from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story building at 607 E. Washington Ave. has four units vacant and six 
occupied by low-income families. All of the residents might have been forced to 
move had the city declared the building a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
In August, an attorney appointed by the city declared that the outside stairs 
and balcony were so rotten that the building posed a danger to residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney Calls Building Unsafe 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the council, attorney Keith C. Monroe said the apartment 
building is unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"Credible evidence demonstrated," Monroe wrote, "that the stairs located on the 
front of the building . . . are and have been for some time badly dry-rotted 
and deteriorated. They are dangerous for residents and others to use." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the conditions, tenants have been withholding rent from the owners 
since 1985 as part of a countywide rent strike movement. The tenants filed a 
suit against various landlords, demanding better conditions. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley said the owners of the East Washington Avenue building have not made 
repairs or renovations because of the lack of rent income. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley said the owners had intended to demolish the building in 1984 but 
could not proceed with the demolition because of the strike.

COOK'S CORNER PROPOSAL RECEIVES BLOW FROM COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appellate court Monday set back plans for an 8.5-acre commercial 
development at scenic Cook's Corner in Trabuco Canyon, ruling that the county's 
approval of the project was "fatally inconsistent" with previous zoning 
restrictions placed on the area. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal upheld a 1987 Orange County Superior Court 
ruling that had struck down the county's decision to rezone the area from 
agricultural to commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
If it is not appealed, the ruling would force the Live Oak Ltd. development 
firm to try again to have the site rezoned or to drop its development plans for 
the area altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Live Oak wants to put a 54,000-square-foot shopping center at Cook's Corner. 
The shopping center would sit across the street from the landmark Cook's Corner 
tavern, a one-time World War II mess hall that now counts bikers and yuppies 
alike among its clientele. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court found that the county's rezoning of the area from 
agricultural to commercial use conflicted with the general plan supervisors had 
approved in 1980, which limited the intersection to one commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the appellate court reversed the trial court and 
kept intact an environmental impact report that the county had prepared for the 
project. Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour had ruled that the county should 
have prepared a new environmental report on the project, rather than relying on 
a 10-year-old one. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Canyon resident Ray Chandos, who headed the attack on the development, 
said of the ruling issued Monday, "I'm very gratified that the court has told 
the county that is has to live by its own rules." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he is preparing for more battles in case the developer 
pursues the rezoning. 
</P>
<P>
The development proposal "would create a messy traffic situation and spoil the 
view . . . of the scenic corridor. It would make a very unbefitting entrance to 
the Trabuco Canyon and the Cleveland National Forest," Chandos said. "We don't 
want to bear the environmental brunt of this development."

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: FOOTBALL IS A BIG KICK FOR MARTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a goalkeeper in soccer, Tres Martin's performance is measured by saves. 
Martin, 6-foot-2 and 220 pounds, was an All-Pacific Coast League selection last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
As a lineman on Orange High School's football team, Martin's success or failure 
usually can't be measured so tangibly. 
</P>
<P>
But it was hard not to notice Martin's performance Friday night when he 
recovered three fumbles in the Panthers' 15-0 victory over Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Strong defensive line play by Martin, the Times' Athlete of the Week, and J.R. 
Sauni, who also recovered two fumbles against Villa Park, has helped Orange 
shut out two of its four opponents. The early-season success for Orange (3-0-1) 
is a remarkable turnaround for a team that was 2-8 last year and has had only 
one winning season in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Orange's success also can be attributed to new Coach Tom Meiss, who stresses a 
gang-tackling defense, and the new defensive responsibilities Meiss has given 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Before Meiss took over this season, Martin, a senior, strictly was an offensive 
lineman. Meiss said Martin's height allows him the leverage to control the line 
of scrimmage, and he often knocks down passes because "he instinctively knows 
when to go up." 
</P>
<P>
Playing on the defensive line also allows Martin to play with more abandon than 
on offense. "On defense you grab whatever you want, whatever you can," he said. 
"You kind of turn into an animal. It just kind of puts a little rush into you." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who can kick a soccer ball the length of a soccer field, also is 
punting for the first time this year. However, he finds that kicking on the 
football field is not as easy. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss, who calls Martin "Thunderfoot," said it has been difficult having a 
lineman punt. "In practice he never gets a punt more than 20 yards," Meiss 
said. "It just drives me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Panthers, Martin, who has had a few punts of more than 50 
yards, has kicked well in games. He said his goalie instincts take over when he 
is under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Mark Flatten of Pacifica caught six passes for 186 yards and three touchdowns 
in Pacifica's 35-8 victory over La Quinta Friday night. Flatten also 
intercepted two passes as Pacifica won its first game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Howald of Corona del Mar scored four goals, including three in the 
third quarter, as the Sea Kings defeated Long Beach Wilson, 10-4, in the final 
of the South Coast water polo tournament Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Johnson of El Toro caught seven passes for 131 yards and two touchdowns in 
the Chargers' 44-25 victory over Tustin Friday. Johnson, who also is El Toro's 
backup quarterback, completed three of four passes for 39 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Weaver of Fountain Valley had 14 receptions for 199 yards and three 
touchdowns as the Barons came back from a 21-0 deficit to defeat El Modena, 
22-21, Thursday. Weaver also caught a pass from Willy Puga for the two-point 
conversion that won the game.

ORANGE PHARMACEUTICAL AND VIDEO DISTRIBUTOR; 
</P>
<P>
BERGEN BRUNSWIG'S EARNINGS SURGE 37% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Benefiting in part from rising drug prices, Bergen Brunswig Corp., a leading 
distributor of pharmaceutical products and home video cassettes, reported on 
Monday a 37% increase in net earnings for its last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange-based firm posted net income of $47.6 million on sales of $3.92 
billion for the year ended Aug. 31, in contrast with net earnings of $34.7 
million on sales of $3.49 billion for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the company posted net earnings of $10.7 million, up 39% 
from $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1988. Fourth-quarter sales 
increased 11%, to $998 million from $899 million for the same period the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen Brunswig is riding a wave of rising sales among pharmaceutical 
distributorships. John McRae, vice president of Baer Stearns &amp; Co. Inc., an 
investment banking firm in New York, said industry consolidation has reduced 
price competition, as larger regional firms have bought up the smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, McRae said, new drugs are coming on the market at premium prices 
because of the vast amount of research that has gone into their development. 
</P>
<P>
And the prices of other drugs are increasing, he said, which is passed on to 
distributors, who generally get a percentage cut of the wholesale price of the 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, George E. Reinhardt Jr., Bergen Brunswig's chief financial officer, said 
many hospitals and drugstores that once bought drugs directly from 
manufacturers have been shifting to using wholesalers in a bid to reduce costs 
associated with maintaining large inventories. 
</P>
<P>
The new customers, Reinhardt said, want to better match their stock to changing 
market demand. While pharmaceutical firms generally sell drugs in bulk, such 
wholesalers as Bergen Brunswig will make smaller deliveries on a daily basis, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
McRae said Bergen Brunswig has succeeded in expanding its market share by 
offering customers the convenience of a computerized order entry system that 
keeps track of their sales and current inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Also, McRae said, Bergen Brunswig has improved its profit margins through the 
automation of warehouses, which has allowed the company to consolidate 
operations and cut labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commtron Also Grows 
</P>
<P>
Commtron Corp., the home video and consumer electronics side of Bergen 
Brunswig's business, has also had growth. Sales totaled $550 million for the 
1989 fiscal year, up 16% over $475 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Operating earnings of $11.3 million represented an 88% improvement over $6 
million in fiscal 1988. The company credited in part the release of new home 
videos, especially "Rain Man" -- the hit movie starring Dustin Hoffman -- in 
the fourth quarter, and more cost-efficient operations. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt said Bergen Brunswig also cut costs in fiscal 1989 by converting $135 
million in debentures to common stock. That move, he said, significantly 
lowered the corporation's long-term debt and eliminated about $10 million in 
annual interest payments.

DIAL-A-LAWYER FIRM OFFERS SERVICES BY PHONE -- AT $2 A MINUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pay-as-you-go telephone industry has brought us the $2 surf report, $50 
sexual fantasies and 50-cent-a-call "vote-ins" on presidential debates. 
</P>
<P>
Now a Huntington Beach attorney plans to use the increasingly popular "900" 
lines to bring the might of a full-size law firm as close as your home, 
business or -- for cellular phone users -- car, boat or airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Thursday, callers from throughout California can dial the special 900 
line for Tele-Lawyer to get legal advice from practicing attorneys, from 8 a.m. 
until 8 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
The bill will be $2 a minute, or $120 an hour, for the rest of this month, 
going up to $3 a minute, or $180 an hour, on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But most clients are expected to complete their business in well under an hour, 
said Michael Cane, founder and president of Tele-Lawyer, 1978 graduate of the 
USC School of Law and former University of Hawaii law teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Cane, 35, practiced law briefly in both Honolulu and Newport Beach before 
"burning out because of the pressure to come up with 220 billable hours every 
month." He said the idea for a telephone legal advice service came from his 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, I got an awful lot of legal questions from them and I wondered 
if there wasn't someplace else for these people to go. I checked around and 
found out there really wasn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most attorneys, Cane said, "won't handle the kinds of things we'll do, because 
they don't take much time. But they are important to the people who need the 
help." 
</P>
<P>
What Tele-Lawyer isn't, he said, is a legal referral service. "We won't just 
refer you to a law firm, like most legal help lines do. We are a law firm." 
</P>
<P>
As he gets ready for the official launch of the business, Cane said he has six 
full-time attorneys on staff with two more slated to come aboard in several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, located on Beach Boulevard in Huntington Beach but not generally open 
to walk-in business, also has three legal researchers and several telephone 
receptionists to take calls and refer them to the attorney with the right 
specialty. 
</P>
<P>
That last item is important because on a 900 call, the clock starts running as 
soon as the phone is answered. 
</P>
<P>
Cane said that his staff attorneys have an average of 10 years' experience. 
Most are either retired or, "like me, are burn-outs who don't want that 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
If the attorneys have signed on so they can make money with less pressure, a 
fair question is what do they deliver to the paying customer? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, Cane said, "is preventive law at affordable rates. We are going to 
do something that no one else is really doing, offering legal advice and help, 
often before a situation erupts into a lawsuit or court case. 
</P>
<P>
"The 900 number makes billing possible by keeping strict tabs on the time, and 
our computer system makes it possible to deliver the advice promptly, 
accurately and affordably because we have already done a lot of the research 
and aren't charging each client for reinventing the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
When a client calls in, Cane said, the call is routed to an attorney with the 
proper background who first does a computer search to make sure there is no 
conflict of interest with other clients or cases. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, we access the data base which lists the different categories of 
law. We have 11 major categories and dozens of subcategories. . . . The 
attorney calls up the proper area and gets the applicable California law on the 
subject and then can advise the client." 
</P>
<P>
And if the data base is blank and the attorney doesn't know the answer? 
</P>
<P>
"We ask the client to call back at a specified time and the charges stop. Then 
one of our researchers looks up the information and puts it into the data base, 
at no charge to the client. When the client calls back, we have the answer or 
advice."

Referral Services 
</P>
<P>
Callers to Tele-Lawyer also can get referrals to a variety of services, 
including most state and private social services, hospitals, crisis clinics, 
child care and all state government and court offices, Cane said. 
</P>
<P>
"So if a woman calls and says she was beaten by her husband, we not only tell 
her how to go about getting a TRO (temporary restraining order) against him, we 
refer her to a nearby center for battered women." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Crane said, Tele-Lawyer will mail or send a facsimile of a sample 
motion for a TRO to the client to help her fill out her own. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also will fax or mail clients prepared samples of appropriate legal 
forms and letters, including wills, contracts and deeds.

FILENET BLAMES DELAYS FOR REVENUES, EARNINGS FALLING BELOW EXPECTATIONS

Blaming administrative and customer delays, FileNet Corp. said Monday that its 
revenues and earnings for the third quarter will be considerably below Wall 
Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
And Wall Street didn't like the news from the Costa Mesa manufacturer of 
computerized document storage and retrieval systems. FileNet's stock fell 17.3% 
to $10.75 per share, down $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts had generally expected FileNet to report a healthy profit 
for the quarter ended Sept. 30 and earnings per share of between 19 cents and 
26 cents. But the company said Monday that it will report a barely profitable 
quarter and per-share earnings of about 1 cent. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had also been predicting quarterly revenues to come in at $22.5 
million to $23.5 million, but FileNet said revenue will only be about $18.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lower-than-expected financial results, FileNet still expects a 
stronger quarter than a year ago, when it reported a loss of 22 cents per share 
and revenues of $12.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Smith, FileNet chairman and chief executive, said delays in concluding 
contract negotiations with several customers, as well as delays in the 
completion of several orders from some major customers during the quarter, were 
the primary reasons for the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
FileNet said it expects to release final quarterly results by Oct. 23. Compiled

O.C. THEATER / JAN HERMAN: 'LYSISTRATA' ESCHEWS THE LOW ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The peace cry of the '60S, "Make love, not war," might have been coined in 
ancient Greece by Aristophanes, except that he was more tough-minded than the 
flower-power generation. 
</P>
<P>
In his feminist, anti-war farce "Lysistrata" -- first produced in Athens in 411 
BC, after 20 years of devastating military conflict with Sparta -- all the 
women of Greece form a united front against all the men and issue an ultimatum: 
Quit making war or we won't make love. 
</P>
<P>
While the goals of both declarations are the same, of course, the tactical 
implications are considerably different: One offers seduction; the other 
requires self-sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
"Lysistrata," which opened over the weekend at the Alternative Repertory 
Theatre in Santa Ana, leaves no doubt that a bedroom strike won't be easy for 
lusty women who claim that they'd rather walk barefoot on hot coals than give 
up their carnal pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
Already feeling sexually deprived because their husbands have been gone so long 
in battle, they lament the absence of substitute lovers and even the scarcity 
of artificial sex toys. As for masturbation, they complain that it just doesn't 
equal the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, these women will not simply issue a no-sex ultimatum in the mere 
hope that it will be an effective measure for peace. They also will ensure that 
it works by enflaming their warrior men with desire and, at the risk of being 
raped, turn icy to drive home their point. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, that grande dame strategist, Lysistrata, doesn't overrate the 
power of sex. Getting the men of Athens to agree to a peace settlement with the 
Spartans is also a practical matter of financing. She exhorts the women to 
storm the Acropolis and seize the public treasury. "No more money, no more 
war," she argues. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Aristophanes never loses sight of the sexual satire. And the best scene 
in ART's "Lysistrata" turns out, not surprisingly, to be a sendup of Myrrhine 
taking her randy husband Cinesias to bed -- or so he thinks. Imbued with the 
spirit of farce, the seduction is too humorous to be obscene but just bawdy 
enough to seem, at least for a moment, risque. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this 90-minute production could use more daring on the whole. Here was 
the chance for director Patricia L. Terry to make an outrageous splash with a 
gutsy, brazen show that would test the limits of theatrical boldness, not to 
mention community standards. 
</P>
<P>
Instead it fusses and winks, unable to decide whether it really wants to take 
responsibility for Aristophanes. It seems satisfied to get giggles from his 
wealth of double-entendres and phallic allusions. And that is all it gets, 
apparently preferring the safety of the timid vaudevillian to the risks of the 
master vulgarian. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the blame lies in the choice of the translation, which casts a 
pseudo-classical pall on the language. As Lysistrata, Caryn Ronis shoulders the 
load to a fault, like a Shakespearean trouper in varying degrees of dudgeon. 
Somebody ought to sedate Amy Larson, though. She doubles as Calonice and 
Rhodippe in a non-stop, histrionic dither. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, M. James Breslin scores nicely with a low-key performance as 
Strymodorous. His ironic comments are models of precise timing. Breslin also 
doubles as Cinesias opposite Terra Shelman as Myrrhine. Scott Andrew Burchard 
plays the stentorian magistrate. Others in the cast are Michael McKay, Wendy 
Robinson and Lee Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Where this production succeeds most effectively is in Christa Bartels' spare 
scenic design. The minimalist set consists of a marble-like floor and four 
movable stelae to evoke the Acropolis. It not only looks good, it also solves 
the problem of cramped space that has plagued other productions in ART's 
61-seat, storefront theater-in-the-round. 
</P>
<P>
Another notable touch is Gary Christensen's sound design as well as his masks, 
which lend a certain charm to the lowbrow characters. Karen J. Weller's 
peculiar headdresses are too ornate by half, yet they complement the pleasantly 
understated costumes. 
</P>
<P>
For all its faults, this lightweight "Lysistrata" holds out the hope that ART's 
third season will be brighter than the first two if only because the troupe now 
seems willing to entertain. Also, playgoers will not find a more immaculate 
little theater anywhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>

PHOEBE SNOW IS BACK, WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a generation of pop musicians well into their second and third decades of 
dealing with the hazards of high public visibility, it's no surprise that 
images of personal redemption and recovery are rapidly catching up with love 
stories as sources of inspiration. Survival and renewal seem to have become the 
buzzwords of the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Take singer Phoebe Snow, who opens a three-night engagement at the Coach House 
in San Juan Capistrano tonight. This week's performances come at the close of a 
fatiguing six-month world tour undertaken to support her first album in eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Snow's return to the pop-music spotlight after such a lengthy hiatus is 
testimony to her power to survive as well as to the slowly emerging and long 
overdue belief in herself as a performer and as a person. It's been a long and 
winding road and, as Snow says, "I've still got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The high-profile part of her career began in 1974 with the release of "Poetry 
Man," a brilliantly creative effort that was also a commercial success. The 
sudden good fortune had its dark side, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty frightening," Snow, 37, recalled in a telephone conversation 
recently. Virtually overnight, she was "overwhelmed" by a barrage of lawyers, 
accountants, managers and producers. Nasty legal hassles prevented the release 
of a second album until 1976, and Snow's recording career then began moving in 
fits and starts as she worked for a series of producers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, she gave birth to a daughter, Valerie, who was born with brain damage. 
Snow has divided her time over the past 14 years between music and motherhood, 
and there were many times that music had to take second place. 
</P>
<P>
(Snow today maintains that all matters regarding her daughter are private. She 
said only that "Valerie's doing fantastically well, and that's no exaggeration. 
She's happy and healthy. She'll be 14 in December, and she's absolutely 
beautiful. I hate being away from her.") 
</P>
<P>
Snow's last recording before the current "Something Real," issued on 
Elektra/Asylum in April, was 1981's "Rock Away." In the interim, her singing 
was limited to commercials for items such as Louis Rich turkeys and Hallmark 
cards and to a series of demo tapes she made in a home four-track studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what was going to become of those songs at the time," Snow said, 
"but it's a good thing I did them. Practically everything on the new record was 
demoed in that studio -- plus 14 others that weren't used that may wind up on 
my next record." 
</P>
<P>
The hiatus also gave Snow a period in which to pursue some deep introspection. 
Snow says it was a time in which she began to find herself and, as with most 
creative artists, her work was very much a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I began to look at my songs, I realized that everything was subjective; I 
really saw me beating myself up, sometimes. And I don't believe I do that 
anymore, thank God. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want to come across as somebody who's always moaning, 'Oh, you 
walked out on me and I want to die.' That's not where I'm at, not at all. Not 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The "jinx," Snow said, was broken on her new album with "a sort of silly, 
happy, up-tempo song: 'Cardiac Arrest.' I actually wrote it about seven or 
eight years ago, but it held up. And it proved to me -- when I heard the final 
production -- that I can write this kind of song, and I'm going to write 
similar songs in the future." 
</P>
<P>
She had some reservations about another piece, "Touch Your Soul," however: 
"That's the kind of song where I get into this whole thing in which I'm talking 
to a guy, and I'm saying, basically: 'I saw you cheating on me with somebody 
else. And even though I'm not interested in you, I might run into you again, 
sometime. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
"I really was wallowing in a lot of negativity with that one," she said. "I 
know a lot of people really like that song, but for me, it reflects a mood and 
an atmosphere that I don't want to have anything to do with anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Snow has spent the last year, she said, working hard to break out of what she 
sees as a spiral of co-dependent relationships. "I've spent this entire year," 
she said, "discovering that there is another way to have relationships that's 
different from the way I used to have them. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why, at the moment, I don't have a relationship -- and, by the way, 
it's working out great. I'm really happy, I'm feeling centered, and I'm not at 
all interested in getting involved -- at least not until I figure out how to do 
it constructively." 
</P>
<P>
That determination to take control also extends to her work. Less than fully 
content with the album that signaled her return to prominence in the music 
business, she is determined to avoid the same mistakes in her next recording. 
</P>
<P>
"I was rusty when we made 'Something Real,' " Snow said. "I hadn't been in the 
studio for eight years, and I was a little overwhelmed by the whole process of 
getting acclimated. I think I just got swept up in the whole movement of the 
thing, and even though I had a certain degree of artistic involvement and 
control, it probably wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you that won't happen again," she said firmly, "because the 
responsibility for my career is in my own hands. If I've learned anything, it's 
that no matter where you work or what you do -- no matter what industry or what 
job -- if you have a very positive and firm self-image, you'll make it. And 
that's what I'm working on, right here and right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoebe Snow will perform at 8 p.m. tonight through Thursday at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $27.50. 
Information: (714) 496-8930.

The Grove Shakespeare Festival, the county's second-largest professional 
theater, will hold a fund-raising walk-a-thon on Oct. 14. The 16-kilometer 
"Walk for William" will begin at 8 a.m. at the Festival Amphitheatre in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping for 100 walkers," Susan Baldwin-Wenner, the newly hired general 
manager of the Grove's Gem Theatre, said Monday. "At this point we have 50 
walkers." She said the Festival Guild hopes to raise as much as $25,000 for the 
cash-strapped theater between the walk-a-thon and a previously announced 
"Shakespeare Closet Sale" of costumes from Grove productions, which is also 
being held Oct. 14 at the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
The route for the walk will wind through the streets of Garden Grove over a 
four-kilometer course. Information: (714) 636-7213.

PIANIST O'CONOR SELECTS FULLERTON FOR SOUTHLAND DEBUT; 
</P>
<P>
IRISH STAR IMPRESSIVE WITH RENDITIONS OF BEETHOVEN SONATAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton High School on a Sunday afternoon might seem an unlikely place for a 
winner of two major international piano competitions to make his Southern 
California debut. Nevertheless, there he was, Irish pianist John O'Conor, 
winner of both the International Beethoven Competition and the Bosendorfer 
Piano Competition, ready to perform at the appointed time and place for the 
North Orange County Community Concert Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His program was a strong one, consisting of two sonatas by Beethoven -- the 
"Waldstein" Sonata, Opus 53 and the Sonata Opus 31, No.1 -- the Four Piano 
Pieces, Opus 119 by Brahms and Book One of Debussy's "Images." Though hampered 
by the gymnasium-like acoustics of Plummer Auditorium and an edgy-toned piano, 
O'Conor managed intelligent and communicative readings. 
</P>
<P>
The two Beethoven sonatas framed the program. O'Conor began with the relatively 
neglected Opus 31, No. 1 in a crisp, straightforward account that quietly 
revealed the work's gentle humor and untroubled discourse. His attention was 
directed toward subtleties of dynamic and rhythmic clarity. 
</P>
<P>
His "Waldstein" Sonata was a different matter. He attacked the first movement 
with considerable aggression at a very brisk pace. Driving energy was the main 
concern. But he didn't leave detail behind, and moments of repose, such as his 
warm, roundly shaped playing of the second theme, gave his reading dimension. 
Variety of color and articulation marked his serene, spacious account of the 
Finale. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahms pieces were intimately communicated with a clear, understated 
lyricism. Each was a concise, carefully molded statement. O'Conor gave the 
three pieces from Debussy's "Images" an elegant, multicolored, atmospheric 
performance. In both the Brahms and the Debussy works, climaxes had breadth and 
controlled emotion; O'Conor never stooped to impress through piano-slamming 
sonority or glittering virtuosity. One's concentration was always firmly drawn 
to the music. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke briefly before each work in much the same intelligent and personable 
manner in which he played them. His sole encore was a beautiful, simple 
nocturne by fellow Dubliner John Field.

ALMANAC / EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK: JOB PROSPECTS LOOKING BRIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Job prospects are bright for the fourth quarter in Orange County and throughout 
the West, according to a nationwide survey of more than 14,000 employers. The 
findings show that 22% of the county employers questioned were planning to hire 
additional workers, while only 7% anticipated cuts in staffing, 69% expected no 
change and 2% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Manpower Inc. of Milwaukee, found the best employment 
prospects for Orange County in the education, transportation-utility and 
finance-insurance-real estate sectors. Some staff reductions were predicted in 
the durable goods sector. 
</P>
<P>
The net change in employment predicted, calculated by subtracting planned 
decreases from increases, was 15% for the county. The figure, while far better 
than the previous year's fourth-quarter figure of 3%, is slightly more than 
half the 28% net increase expected for the period in 1981 -- on the eve of the 
most-recent recession. 
</P>
<P>
For the West, the outlook was the strongest of any region in the country. 
Hiring plans in the construction industry exceeded any fourth quarter since the 
booming, post-recession winter of 1977. The West was alone nationally in 
planning to increase the ranks of construction workers and in bolstering staff 
in finance, insurance and real estate.

Stock prices for 59% of San Fernando Valley-area companies rose during the 
third quarter, following the broader increase in the overall stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 61 major publicly held companies in the area, 36 saw their stock prices 
rise in the three months that ended Friday. Twenty-two of those stocks 
appreciated 10% or more in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
There were 22 stocks that lost ground, and three were unchanged. Stocks 
included in the survey include those with headquarters between Glendale and 
Camarillo, and include stocks that traded for at least $2 at the begining of 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was another strong quarter for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most 
widely followed stock indicator, which gained 252.76 points or 10.4% during the 
period, finally closing the period at 2,692.82 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
36% Gain 
</P>
<P>
The biggest Valley-area gainer for the latest quarter was Lincoln Bancorp, the 
Encino-based holding company for Lincoln National Bank, which saw its stock 
rise 36% from $14.38 a share to $19.50. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln reported in July that its profits for the quarter that ended June 30 
rose 82% from a year earlier, to $1.6 million from $881,865. 
</P>
<P>
A number of bank stocks have been rising since a series of California bank 
mergers were announced in August and September, reigniting speculation about 
more takeovers in the industry, according to Dan B. Williams, a banking analyst 
for Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco. That speculation has centered around a 
change in rules that will allow out-of-state banks to acquire California 
banking institutions beginning in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Clark Productions' stock rose 33%, from $4.88 a share to $6.50. The 
Burbank-based television production company has staged a modest comeback, 
earning about $2.6 million on sales of $25.6 million in the year that ended 
June 30, contrasted with a loss of $2.4 million on sales of $21.2 million in 
1988. Dick Clark also announced last week that it was developing 11 television 
specials for the fall season. 
</P>
<P>
Another large percentage gainer during the quarter was HCC Industries, the 
Encino maker of hermetically sealed electrical connection devices, whose stock 
rose 30% from $5.75 a share to $7.50. 
</P>
<P>
In August a group of top HCC managers announced an $8.50-per-share leveraged 
buyout offer. Shortly afterward, a group of public stockholders filed suit to 
block the bid, but there have been no major developments since. Before the 
offer, the stock had traded for about $6.25 per share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citadel Up 
</P>
<P>
The stock of Citadel Holding Corp., the Glendale holding company for Fidelity 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan, which Monday changed its name to Fidelity Federal 
Bank, rose 30% from $39.13 a share to $51. The stock seemed little affected by 
the announcement Friday that Citadel had decided after two years of 
consideration not to acquire Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
But Citadel apparently rode the general upward trend of S &amp; L stocks during 
the quarter. Thrift stocks have risen since it became apparent that Congress 
would pass a bill bailing out the industry, according to Williams. Investors 
believe that healthy S &amp; Ls such as Fidelity Federal will be able to lower 
the interest rates they offer on deposits once the federal government 
liquidates or sells off the most sickly thrifts. That should improve the S 
&amp; Ls' profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment giant Walt Disney's stock rose 28%, from $94.63 a share to 
$120.88. The Burbank-based company released a number of summertime hit movies, 
including "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," "Dead Poets Society" and "Turner &amp; 
Hooch." 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment stocks have also risen, fueled by mergers and acquisitions in the 
industry, such as last week's announcement that Sony Corp. would purchase 
Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Superior Gains 
</P>
<P>
Superior Industries International's stock rose 25%, from $20 a share to $25. 
Profits for the Van Nuys maker of aluminum and steel automobile wheels 
increased about 30% in its first and second quarters, contrasted with the same 
periods last year. 
</P>
<P>
As a maker of aluminum wheels, Superior has positioned itself to take advantage 
of "one of the few growth trends in the auto industry," according to Todd 
Berko, an industry analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. Berko said 
the aluminum wheels are more popular with car makers because they are lighter 
and more easily machined than steel. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser in the area was Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, whose 
stock fell 41%, from $11 a share to $6.50. Much of that drop came Friday when 
the stock fell 32% on news that Citadel had decided not to acquire the ailing S 
&amp; L. Valley Federal has been hurt by losses in its All Valley Acceptance 
Co., a division that makes loans for manufactured housing. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional Industries, an Agoura Hills company that markets camera and 
film-processing packages, also saw its stock fall precipitously during the 
period. Traditional's stock dropped 40% from $9 a share to $5.38. In August, 
the Federal Trade Commission said Traditional could lose up to $50 million in 
sales as the cost of complying with an agreement that the company signed with 
the federal agency -- an estimate that Traditional disputed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alter Sales Practices 
</P>
<P>
Traditional had earlier agreed to alter certain sales practices after the FTC 
had alleged that the company made false claims in advertising the packages. 
</P>
<P>
United Education and Software's stock fell 38% in the latest quarter from $2.63 
a share to $1.63. The Encino company, which operates trade schools, said it 
lost $5 million on sales of $17.5 million for the second quarter, which ended 
July 31, contrasted with a profit of $1.2 million on sales of $20.1 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
UES' profits have plunged since last year when a government review uncovered 
massive problems at a former subsidiary that serviced student loans. The stock 
has plummeted too, from a high in 1988 of $16.38 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Datametrics Corp. saw its stock fall 31% from $2 a share to $1.38. The 
Chatsworth maker of computer printers for the military reported that it lost 
$278,906 on sales of $8.3 million in the period that ended July 29. It was the 
company's third straight quarter of losses.

E. GERMANY TO LET 4,700 TRAVEL WEST;

COMMUNIST REGIME SLAMS DOOR TO ANY FURTHER DEPARTURES

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany agreed today to let the 4,700 East Germans holed up in the West 
German Embassy in Prague travel to West Germany, but the Communist regime also 
slammed the door on any further departures by suspending unrestricted travel to 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said the first train 
of East German refugees will be departing Prague for West Germany some time 
after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time within a week that East Germany had reluctantly agreed 
to let its citizens emigrate west. During the weekend, more than 6,000 refugees 
fled to the West from West German embassies in Poland and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, several hundred East Germans battled a Czechoslovak police 
cordon to reach the West German Embassy in Prague, which had been closed 
because several thousand East Germans already were inside. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said about 300 East Germans tore down a makeshift metal barrier 
blocking a path leading to the back of the embassy, rushed to the fence, which 
is topped by metal spikes, and tried to scale it as police waded in. 
</P>
<P>
Many East Germans were injured by police truncheons or by spikes but were 
helped into the compound by staff and West German Red Cross workers who brought 
out ladders to help the East Germans get over the fence, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
While the East Germans clamored to get into the embassy, the East German 
government tried to make it harder for its citizens to reach Prague by cutting 
off its visa-free policy. 
</P>
<P>
Until today, East Germans needed neither a visa nor a passport to travel to 
Czechoslovakia. The state news agency ADN said that, effective immediately, 
such documents would be required. That will effectively block ordinary citizens 
from going there. 
</P>
<P>
Prague accused West Germany of being irresponsible for letting another batch of 
East Germans into the embassy after the 5,000 people left Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 37,000 East Germans from the nation of 17 million have left for the 
West since May. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors had been circulating in East Germany for weeks that the hard-line 
Communist leadership would act to stem the flow of refugees, but most had 
expected East Berlin to act after its 40th birthday celebrations Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, chief government spokesman Hans Klein said East German leader Erich 
Honecker earlier had refused to talk to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by 
telephone about the refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker aides said preparations for Saturday's 40th anniversary of the 
Communist nation precluded an "appointment for a telephone call," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
The anniversary celebration, which is to include a visit by Soviet leader 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, comes amid perhaps East Germany's most embarrassing 
diplomatic crisis: the exodus of thousands of its citizens.

WILLIAM HURT WINS PALIMONY RULING; DANCER CAN'T CLAIM MOVIE EARNINGS

No common-law marriage exists between actor William Hurt and former dancer 
Sandra Jennings, a judge ruled today, precluding Hurt's former live-in lover 
from claiming a share of his movie earnings, estimated at $5 million to $7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann said the relationship was 
illicit when it began because Hurt was married to someone else, and did not 
become legitimate simply because "The Big Chill" star got divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"Absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married, an agreement to marry cannot 
be inferred from the fact that the parties were living together," the judge 
said. "The contrary is true." 
</P>
<P>
If the judge had determined the two were married under common law, Jennings 
could have pursued support for herself. 
</P>
<P>
The decision did not deal with support for the couple's 6-year-old son, 
Alexander Devon Hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard Golub, called the ruling a "joke" and said he will 
appeal. The judge is "so madly in love with this defendant, Bill Hurt, that we 
never could have gotten a fair shake," he asserted.

RAIDERS FIRE SHANAHAN, APPOINT SHELL AS COACH

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Shanahan was fired as coach of the Raiders today and replaced by assistant 
Art Shell, who becomes the first black head coach in modern NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, 37, was in the second year of a three-year contract. The Raiders are 
1-3 this season, having lost to AFC West opponents Kansas City, Denver and 
Seattle the last three weeks. Shanahan was 7-9 in his first season as coach 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, 42, who has been the offensive line coach for the Raiders, was named to 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year. He retired as a player after the 1982 
seasons after 15 years as one of the top offensive tackles in pro football, all 
with the Raiders, and immediately joined the team's coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Shell joined the Raiders as a third-round draft choice in 1968 after playing at 
Maryland State. He played in 207 NFL games, third-highest total in Raiders' 
history, and played in the Pro Bowl eight times. 
</P>
<P>
A press conference was scheduled this afternoon to introduce Shell as the 
Raiders' head coach.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lawmakers today handed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev a rare defeat, rejecting 
his plea for an emergency ban on strikes that he warns could destroy the 
ravaged Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet legislature instead imposed a selective ban on strikes in key 
economic areas. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that he is satisfied with the compromise and that it will "help 
restore a normal life." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision in support of perestroika," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A day after hearing Gorbachev's proposal to ban all strikes for the next 15 
months, a joint session of the Supreme Soviet's two chambers spent all of today 
in confused debate before arriving at a weakened version. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it approved by a vote of 364 to 6 a temporary ban on strikes in the 
industries of transport, energy, metallurgy and all raw materials until it can 
approve full legislation governing strikes. 
</P>
<P>
A detailed law regulating strikes may be ready as soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
A draft law bans strikes that could threaten the lives or health of people, and 
also in transportation, communications, energy, defense industries and 
government organs. However, many of the key issues in the draft have not yet 
been approved. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev repeated his warning that the Soviet economy is threatened by waves 
of politically motivated job actions, but he did not call again for an outright 
ban on all strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies included in their decision language that would allow the country's 
ministries of interior, defense and transport to take over railroads in Armenia 
and Azerbaijan if necessary to get rail traffic moving again to Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, during a break in the debate, Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin 
called the proposed strike ban unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinary situation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonid Abalkin, a deputy premier in charge of economic reform, said the 
initiative to change the draft resolution came during an overnight meeting of 
deputies and not from Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in calling for a ban on strikes, called the measure necessary "to 
protect democratization from anarchy and irresponsible management." 
</P>
<P>
By inserting the threat to take over operations and security on the country's 
railroads, the legislators were acting to bring an end to a blockade by 
Azerbaijanis of rail lines leading from their republic into Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet law does not ban strikes outright. But labor unrest was ruthlessly 
repressed before Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and began his effort to turn 
the Soviet Union into a country ruled by law instead of dictate. 
</P>
<P>
The most damaging strike this year was a walkout in July by thousands of coal 
miners in the far north, Siberia, and the Don Basin of the eastern Ukraine. 
That strike cost the country millions of rubles, and the government agreed to a 
package of economic and social improvements that officials said will cost about 
$3 billion.

Polish Communists today voted overwhelmingly to transform -- and rename -- 
their party after their loss of power to the Solidarity movement. 
</P>
<P>
Politburo member Leszek Miller told the Central Committee that a plebiscite by 
the membership on the future of the Polish United Workers' Party, the official 
name of the Communist party, had produced a landslide vote for change. 
</P>
<P>
The result means that the 41-year-old party, formed to impose Stalinism on 
postwar Poland, will probably cease to exist in its current form in a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders have already proposed renaming it the Polish Socialist Labor 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said 1.1 million of the party's 2.2 million members took part in the 
plebiscite on the future of the party and 72.1% voted yes to the question: "Are 
you, comrade, for transformation of the Polish United Workers' Party into a new 
party with a new program, statutes and name?" 
</P>
<P>
The results did not define the shape or name of the new party, which will be 
decided at a special congress that Miller proposed for Jan. 27.

Two Dutchmen were each jailed for five years today for stealing three paintings 
by Vincent van Gogh last year in the Netherlands' biggest art theft. 
</P>
<P>
A Dutch court convicted Anton Willem Baeten, 37, and Anton Overweel, 30, for 
stealing the paintings worth up to $100 million from the Kroeller-Mueller 
Museum and demanding a ransom for their return. 
</P>
<P>
One of the stolen paintings, "Weaver's Loom and Weaver," was recovered last 
April when the thieves left it in a car trunk and said they would destroy the 
other two unless they received $2.2 million. The other two paintings, "Wilted 
Sunflowers," and "The Potato Eaters," were recovered in July after the men's 
arrest.

<P>
A judge sentenced Israeli peace activist Abie Nathan today to six months in 
prison for violating an Israeli law by meeting with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan, who pleaded guilty to the charge last week, said he would fight to 
overturn the law "even from my prison cell." He received a one-year suspended 
sentence in addition to the jail term. 
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Nathan operates the pirate radio station "Voice of Peace" from 
a ship in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan stood silent as Aharon Fass, deputy president of the Ramle Magistrate's 
Court, read the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The activist told reporters later that his jailing would not halt his efforts 
for Arab-Israeli peace. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody thinks I'm going to stop . . . they're in for big surprises," he 
said. "I hope that public opinion and the people in the streets will understand 
that this law is an obstacle to peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I will continue even from my prison cell to protest against this law . . . and 
immediately after prison I shall continue to speak to the enemy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan pleaded guilty Wednesday to meeting with Arafat and other PLO activists 
in Tunisia and France in September, 1988. He told the court he knew he was 
violating a 1986 amendment to the anti-terror law that prohibits holding 
meetings with terrorist organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the sentence, leaders of two left-wing political parties, Shinui 
and the Citizen's Rights Movement, called for the repeal of the law prohibiting 
meetings with the PLO, which Israel refuses to recognize and labels as a 
terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizen's Rights Movement said it will propose a law at the next session of 
the Knesset to allow meetings with the PLO for the purpose of promoting peace.

The House approved legislation today restricting federal assistance for art 
"considered obscene," a compromise that averted stricter prohibitions sought by 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
On a 381-41 vote, the lawmakers sent a spending bill containing the language to 
the Senate, which is considered likely to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
The art provision, worked out by House-Senate negotiators last week, represents 
a dilution of a measure sought by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) forbidding the 
government to finance artwork that is obscene or indecent or that offends any 
religion, race, ethnic group, age group or handicapped group. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it establishes a two-part test for support by the National Endowment 
for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The government would be prohibited from providing money to exhibitions "that 
may be considered obscene," such as works depicting sadomasochism, 
homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in 
sex acts. In addition, the work would have to lack "serious literary, artistic, 
political or scientific value." 
</P>
<P>
Both decisions would be left up to NEA officials. The language would be in 
effect for one year, during which a commission would study how the NEA makes 
grants and whether permanent standards for the art it supports are needed.

Sales of new homes fell 0.4% in August, dropping back slightly from a huge 
double-digit gain in July, the government reported today. Mortgage rates edged 
up at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that new single-family homes were sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 755,000 units in August, following a 16.1% 
gain in July, the largest increase in nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
The July sales increase was the largest monthly advance since September, 1986, 
when sales climbed 22.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had credited the July advance to a decline in fixed-rate mortgages 
which had fallen to 9.81% by the end of that month from a peak of 11.22% last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
But rates edged back up to 10.22% by the end of August, according to a monthly 
survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., contributing to the decline in 
home sales that month.

The president of the aerospace machinists local said today the union will 
recommend its nearly 60,000 members turn down Boeing's last contract offer, 
increasing the likelihood of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The union is recommending that the proposal be rejected," said Tom Baker, 
president of Local 751 of the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Baker would not discuss details of Boeing's final offer, which was presented by 
company negotiators Monday. However, at a meeting scheduled later today, union 
members will hear the details of a proposed three-year contract that reportedly 
would provide pay increases of 4% the first year and 3% in each of the last two 
years, as well as production bonuses of 8% and 4% in the first two years. 
</P>
<P>
Similar meetings were scheduled at Wichita, Kan., Portland, Ore. and several 
other cities where Boeing plants are located. 
</P>
<P>
If the contract is rejected, Baker said he anticipates that machinists will 
strike Boeing for the first time since 1977. A strike would be effective 
midnight today.

FERRANTI LOSES ONE-THIRD OF VALUE ON LONDON MARKET

<P>
British defense contractor Ferranti, shellshocked by apparent fraud at its U.S. 
unit which has cost it almost $300 million, lost about a third of its market 
value today when its shares resumed trading on the London stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Shares in Ferranti International Signal PLC opened at 81 cents, 32% below the 
$1.19 price at which they were suspended Sept. 11 when the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, the shares dipped even further but then recovered to stabilize. 
Last February they touched their high for the year at $1.83. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which specializes in military electronics, has been rocked by what 
it said was a costly fraud involving contracts of its U.S. subsidiary, ISC 
Technologies, based in Lancaster, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Ferranti has alleged that it inherited three fraudulent contracts when it 
bought ISC, a weapons firm selling mainly to Third World customers, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the British company will have to write off 185 million pounds 
($299 million) and halve its stated 1988-89 profits. 
</P>
<P>
Ferranti has said it is discussing a range of options to bring in new capital, 
including a complete takeover, a rights issue and a minority partner. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts believe a predator could strike before Ferranti management 
clinches its own rescue deal. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to build a stake in Ferranti, today provides a good opportunity 
to snap up stock without drawing too much attention," one dealer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferranti topped the actives list with more than 70 million shares changing 
hands in the first hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
The opening share price valued the whole of Ferranti at $605.4 million, down 
from its market capitalization of $890 million at the suspension date. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the share price was higher than expected and predicted 
that it will eventually settle at between 65 cents and 73 cents.

Stocks shot to a record close today after a dollar rally inspired new buying by 
institutions at the start of a new fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 40.84 points to 2,754.56. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 2 to 1 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, with 995 up, 511 down and 468 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled a heavy 182.55 million shares, against 127.41 million 
in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.94 to 196.84. 
</P>
<P>
A strong dollar, despite central bank intervention, encouraged investors to buy 
stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record close was the Sept. 1 finish of 2,752.09. Stocks then fell 
in a month-long correction, but recovered this month, starting with Monday's 
20-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
The stocks of financial service and other consumer-oriented businesses were 
among the standouts in today's session, while some technology issues were among 
the losers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were looking for issues with predictable growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Gain 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose in early trading today, strengthened largely by what brokers 
called optimism about lower interest rates and internal market influences that 
temporarily created more demand than supply. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose about 11/32 point or roughly $3.40 
per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, eased to 
8.18% from 8.21% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose 1/4 to 3/16 point, intermediate maturities rose about 1/4 point and 
long-term issues rose about 1/4 to 1/2 point, the Telerate Inc. financial 
information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 2.68 to 1,173.29. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a 
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 
0.34 to 329.97. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.03% as the discount fell 9 basis 
points from the level at auction Monday to 7.77%. Yields on six-month bills 
fell to 8.28% as the discount fell 4 basis points from the level at auction 
Monday to 7.85%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.39% as the discount fell 7 
basis points to 7.80%.

European central banks intervened against the dollar today for the seventh 
consecutive trading day, trimming its value by less than half a pfennig and 
half a yen. 
</P>
<P>
The morning bout of intervention by seven central banks served as a powerful 
reminder that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations want to see the 
dollar lower still. Last week's barrage of concerted dollar sales sliced around 
4% off the currency's value. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan had intervened earlier today during Asian trading hours. The 
European intervention was joined by the central banks of West Germany, Britain, 
France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
About half an hour after the intervention started, the dollar was trading 
around 1.8775 West German marks and 140.50 Japanese yen. It had opened in 
London at 1.8817 marks and 140.80 yen.

Four-time Indianapolis 500 winner A. J. Foyt was injured today when he crashed 
at Charlotte Motor Speedway during a practice session for the All-Pro Auto 
Parts 500. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit the wall in turn three, slid about 300 yards and came to a stop at the 
entrance of pit road," said speedway spokesman Eddie Gossage. "The track 
emergency staff worked about 10 minutes to get him out of the car. They were 
mostly trying to be easy because they didn't want to hurt him worse than he 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Gossage said Foyt was "conscious and alert" when taken to the speedway 
hospital. He was later airlifted to Charlotte Memorial Hospital, and hospital 
officials would give no details of his injuries or condition. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why he hit the wall," Gossage said. "It was just practice. He 
wasn't racing the car. But he hit the wall very hard."

Catcher Gary Carter and first baseman Keith Hernandez, leaders of the New York 
Mets' World Series championship club three years ago, have played their last 
games with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Both Carter and Hernandez said the Mets told them today that they would make no 
effort to re-sign them. Both are free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Carter batted .183 this year with two home runs and 15 RBIs. Hernandez hit .233 
with four homers and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best for Me to Move On' 
</P>
<P>
"He felt it would be best for me to move on to another ballclub," Carter said 
after meeting with General Manager Frank Cashen. "This ballclub is going 
through a transition. They're going to a younger trend of ballplayers." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who shared National League Most Valuable Players honors as a St. 
Louis Cardinal in 1978, quoted Cashen as saying the club planned to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's time to move on to the third stage of my career," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he would like to play two or three more years. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can still play this game," he said. "I know there will be an 
opportunity out there." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 38 games short of Al Lopez's National League record of 1,918 games 
caught, also is 93 hits short of 2,000 and 45 runs short of 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
He would like to eclipse the Lopez record, which means he would prefer to 
remain in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta is in need of a catcher," he said. "I don't like the idea that they 
finished in last place. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be basically a remodeling year. But, hey, the Baltimore Orioles 
finished last last year (and a close second this year)." 
</P>
<P>
Both Carter and Hernandez had emotional finales last Wednesday at Shea Stadium. 
Carter even managed a pinch-hit double in his final at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys are the prime reasons why this organization has been successful in 
the last six years," said Manager Davey Johnson, who thinks he will be let go 
too. "They're consummate professionals, and I always felt secure putting their 
names on the lineup card."

A bid to end a damaging monthlong strike at Peugeot, France's biggest private 
auto maker, appeared to be in jeopardy today after strikers refused to end 
their occupation of a key foundry. 
</P>
<P>
Trade union officials said one group of strikers voted to continue a sit-in at 
the Mulhouse foundry in eastern France. 
</P>
<P>
The strike by several hundred workers at the Sochaux and Mulhouse plants -- a 
small minority of the work force -- has cut back production of Peugeot's 
best-selling 205 model and cast a shadow over the launch of the luxury 605 
model. 
</P>
<P>
First deliveries were made to showrooms Monday morning and a Peugeot spokesman 
said there were enough cars to meet initial orders. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the car maker, which employs 145,000 people in France, said 
Peugeot will withdraw its offer of talks if the strikers failed to leave the 
foundry by Wednesday.
